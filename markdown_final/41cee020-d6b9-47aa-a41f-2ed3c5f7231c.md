Prolactin

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about prolactin biology, regulation, measurement, pathophysiology, and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the molecular and structural basis of prolactin and its receptor. Then, I should verify the regulatory control, including dopamine inhibition and feedback loops. Next, I will examine physiological roles beyond lactation, including metabolic, immune, and neurobehavioral functions. After that, I need to check assay pitfalls like macroprolactin and the hook effect. Then, I will classify causes of hyperprolactinemia and outline a diagnostic algorithm. Finally, I will review management strategies, special populations, and controversies such as cancer risk and metabolic effects, ensuring each step is supported by appropriate references.

> Let me first confirm the molecular framework. Prolactin is a 23 kDa polypeptide hormone synthesized by lactotrophs in the anterior pituitary, with a receptor belonging to the class 1 hematopoietic cytokine receptor superfamily that signals through JAK2–STAT5 and other pathways, enabling pleiotropic effects across tissues [^115ETrsb] [^111tZecA]. Wait, let me verify the receptor architecture and signaling; yes, the PRL receptor is structurally related to growth hormone receptor and engages canonical cytokine receptor signaling cascades, which explains its broad tissue responsiveness [^115ETrsb].

> I need to ensure I capture regulation correctly. Prolactin is unique among anterior pituitary hormones in being under predominant hypothalamic inhibitory control by dopamine via D2 receptors, with a short-loop negative feedback whereby prolactin stimulates tuberoinfundibular dopamine neurons to restrain further release. TRH, estrogens, and stress can stimulate secretion, and circadian rhythms show higher levels during sleep, especially REM, with sex differences in amplitude [^1128YZCv] [^115DRMo7] [^112Hte5u]. Hold on, I should verify the circadian detail. Yes, human studies and reviews consistently describe sleep-associated surges and sex dimorphism in rhythm amplitude, aligning with clinical observation of higher nocturnal prolactin [^115DRMo7] [^112Hte5u].

> Next, I should review physiological roles beyond lactation. Prolactin supports mammary development and milk synthesis but also modulates reproductive axes by suppressing GnRH via kisspeptin inhibition, shapes maternal behavior, and exerts metabolic effects including pancreatic β-cell proliferation and insulin regulation, adipose tissue modulation, and hepatic glucose handling. It also participates in immune regulation and osmoregulation, reflecting widespread PRL receptor expression [^115ETrsb] [^112Z7JzD] [^112fu9rL]. Wait, let me verify the metabolic claims. Multiple reviews and studies support adaptive β-cell effects in pregnancy and context-dependent effects on insulin sensitivity, with pathological hyperprolactinemia often worsening insulin resistance, which fits clinical observations in prolactinomas [^112Z7JzD] [^113AmbM3].

> I will now examine assay pitfalls because misdiagnosis is common. Macroprolactin, a high–molecular-weight aggregate often complexed with immunoglobulin, is biologically inactive yet detected by many immunoassays, causing spurious hyperprolactinemia; polyethylene glycol precipitation or specific assays should be used when asymptomatic hyperprolactinemia is suspected, and prevalence can approach 10–20% in some series, so I should double-check that I recommend routine screening in asymptomatic cases [^114LdS4i] [^116wjimn] [^115qEEwo]. Hold on, I should verify the hook effect as well; in very high prolactin states, two-site immunoassays can underestimate true levels, so serial dilutions are warranted when a large pituitary mass coexists with unexpectedly modest prolactin values [^117XMovJ].

> Let me consider the causes of hyperprolactinemia systematically. Physiological causes include pregnancy, lactation, sleep, stress, and exercise; pathological causes include prolactinomas, hypothyroidism, chronic kidney disease, and pituitary stalk compression; pharmacologic causes include dopamine antagonists such as antipsychotics and antiemetics; and assay artifacts include macroprolactin and the hook effect, so I need to ensure a careful medication and systems review before labeling a pituitary disorder [^1137snxN] [^113kKVTw] [^114cgysW]. Wait, I should confirm the CKD point; yes, impaired clearance and altered regulation can yield moderate hyperprolactinemia that normalizes after renal transplantation, which is clinically useful for distinguishing etiologies [^1137snxN].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic algorithm. A single serum prolactin, drawn without excessive venipuncture stress, is sufficient to confirm hyperprolactinemia. If asymptomatic and mildly elevated, screen for macroprolactin. If symptomatic or persistently elevated, exclude secondary causes including medications, hypothyroidism, and CKD. If a pituitary source is suspected, obtain MRI, and if a large adenoma coexists with unexpectedly low prolactin, perform serial dilutions to exclude the hook effect [^116BaVzk] [^117XMovJ] [^114cgysW]. Hold on, I should verify guideline concordance; Endocrine Society and Pituitary Society guidance align with this single-measurement and macroprolactin screening approach, which minimizes unnecessary imaging and treatment [^114cgysW] [^112Hv6QD].

> I will now examine management principles. Dopamine agonists are first-line therapy for prolactinomas, with cabergoline favored for efficacy and tolerability, normalizing prolactin in most patients and shrinking tumors by at least 30% in the majority. Surgery is reserved for dopamine agonist resistance or intolerance, and radiotherapy for refractory cases, while drug-induced hyperprolactinemia may warrant switching agents or adding sex steroids if hypogonadal symptoms or low bone mass are present [^112Hv6QD] [^115yZ5oQ] [^111KEabS]. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence. Contemporary consensus and reviews consistently support medical therapy as primary for prolactinomas, with high rates of biochemical and tumor control, which justifies this hierarchy of care [^112Hv6QD] [^115yZ5oQ].

> But wait, what about pregnancy and lactation. I should confirm that routine prolactin monitoring during pregnancy is not recommended because levels rise 10-fold and pituitary enlargement is expected; dopamine agonists are typically withdrawn preconception when feasible, and postpartum reassessment is advised before restarting therapy, with individualized risk stratification based on tumor size and prior history [^111a8Y4a] [^112DzFSV] [^116LE6Fs]. Hold on, I should verify the rationale; guidelines emphasize that serial prolactin levels do not track tumor behavior during pregnancy, so clinical and visual monitoring take precedence, which aligns with standard practice [^111a8Y4a] [^112DzFSV].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and contexts. In pediatrics, prolactinomas occur and can present with delayed puberty or growth effects, and antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia is a key concern requiring proactive monitoring and management strategies. In psychiatric patients, baseline and follow-up prolactin can guide antipsychotic selection and mitigation of bone health risks, and in men with low libido or hypogonadism, measuring prolactin is recommended to exclude hyperprolactinemia as a reversible cause [^113gb6tq] [^117JamwL] [^112rBVkd]. Let me reconsider the pediatric monitoring point. Although data are limited, expert guidance supports vigilance for prolactin-related adverse effects with prolactin-elevating agents, reinforcing the need for periodic assessment and shared decision-making [^113gb6tq] [^117JamwL].

> Next, I should review controversies and uncertainties. The relationship between prolactin and breast cancer risk is complex; while epidemiologic data link higher circulating prolactin with risk, especially postmenopausally, dopamine agonist trials have not shown benefit, likely because local autocrine/paracrine prolactin in breast tissue drives tumor cell survival rather than circulating levels, so receptor antagonism remains investigational; similarly, metabolic effects of prolactin are context dependent, with physiologic elevations potentially beneficial but pathologic hyperprolactinemia worsening insulin resistance and body composition, which normalizes in many patients after therapy [^115k9veZ] [^113NpE9D] [^113AmbM3]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should not overstate causality in metabolic outcomes; much of the human data are observational, so confounding by hypogonadism and adiposity must be considered even as mechanistic plausibility remains strong [^113AmbM3].

> Finally, I should double-check practical pearls. Always interpret prolactin in clinical context, repeat mildly elevated results to confirm persistence, and use the same assay longitudinally to avoid analytical variability. Remember that galactorrhea is present in only about one-third of hyperprolactinemic women, so its absence does not exclude disease. And in amenorrhea evaluations, levels below about 15–20 ng/mL generally exclude clinically significant hyperprolactinemia, though lab-specific cutoffs apply [^115qEEwo] [^115dXdb8] [^113Fj8qL]. Hold on, I should verify the assay consistency point; inter-assay variability is well documented, so documenting platform and using the same method over time is a simple but critical quality step [^113Fj8qL].

Prolactin is a **pituitary hormone** [^115ETrsb] best known for stimulating breast milk production, but it also regulates reproduction, metabolism, immunity, and behavior [^112Z7JzD] [^112fu9rL] [^115DRMo7]. It is secreted in pulses and under **tonic dopamine inhibition** [^1128YZCv]; pregnancy, lactation, stress, sleep, and dopamine antagonists increase levels, while dopamine agonists suppress them [^111Zyoaj] [^115SESKP] [^115yZ5oQ]. Hyperprolactinemia causes hypogonadism, infertility, galactorrhea, and bone loss [^116gfPMd], and is managed with dopamine agonists or surgery; macroprolactin can cause assay interference and should be excluded [^114LdS4i] [^112jNhUb]. Prolactin also influences metabolism, adipose tissue, and immune function, and may be involved in tumorigenesis and autoimmune disease [^113AmbM3] [^113NpE9D] [^112fu9rL].

---

## Physiological roles

Prolactin has **diverse physiological roles** beyond lactation:

- **Lactation**: Stimulates mammary gland development and milk synthesis during pregnancy and lactation [^115ETrsb].
- **Reproduction**: Modulates gonadal function, menstrual cycles, and fertility in both sexes [^117FQPjR].
- **Metabolism**: Regulates appetite, energy balance, and glucose homeostasis [^112Hte5u].
- **Immune function**: Influences immune cell proliferation and cytokine production [^116RimWL].
- **Behavior**: Affects maternal behavior, stress responses, and mood regulation [^115DRMo7].

---

## Regulation of prolactin secretion

Prolactin secretion is **tightly regulated** by hypothalamic factors:

- **Dopamine**: Primary inhibitory control via D2 receptors; suppresses prolactin synthesis and release [^1128YZCv].
- **Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)**: Stimulates prolactin release, especially during stress and lactation [^113kKVTw].
- **Estrogen**: Enhances prolactin synthesis, particularly during pregnancy [^113kKVTw].
- **Stress, sleep, and exercise**: Physiological stimuli that transiently increase prolactin levels [^1137snxN].

---

## Clinical significance of prolactin

Prolactin measurement is **clinically significant** in several contexts:

- **Hyperprolactinemia**: Elevated levels causing hypogonadism, infertility, galactorrhea, and bone loss [^116gfPMd].
- **Prolactinomas**: Pituitary adenomas causing hyperprolactinemia; managed medically with dopamine agonists or surgically [^112Hv6QD].
- **Macroprolactinemia**: Presence of macroprolactin causing assay interference; requires specific testing to avoid misdiagnosis [^114LdS4i].
- **Pregnancy and lactation**: Physiological hyperprolactinemia supporting maternal adaptations and lactation [^113zVig3].

---

## Pathological conditions associated with altered prolactin levels

Several **pathological conditions** are linked to altered prolactin levels:

| **Condition** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Hyperprolactinemia | Elevated prolactin causing reproductive dysfunction, galactorrhea, and bone loss [^116gfPMd] |
| Prolactinomas | Pituitary tumors causing hyperprolactinemia [^112Hv6QD] |
| Hypoprolactinemia | Rare deficiency associated with lactation failure [^114zs5B6] |
| Autoimmune diseases | Elevated prolactin implicated in SLE and rheumatoid arthritis [^notfound] |
| Cancer | Prolactin may promote tumor growth in breast and prostate cancer [^113NpE9D] |

---

## Diagnostic methods for measuring prolactin levels

Prolactin is measured by **immunoassays** (RIA, ELISA, CLIA), with macroprolactin screening to avoid interference [^114LdS4i]. Dynamic tests are rarely needed; single measurements usually suffice [^116BaVzk].

---

## Treatment strategies for prolactin-related disorders

Treatment depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Dopamine agonists**: First-line for hyperprolactinemia and prolactinomas (cabergoline, bromocriptine) [^115yZ5oQ].
- **Surgery**: Transsphenoidal surgery for resistant or compressive tumors [^115yZ5oQ].
- **Radiotherapy**: Reserved for refractory cases [^115yZ5oQ].
- **Hormone replacement**: Estrogen/testosterone for hypogonadism due to hyperprolactinemia [^111KEabS].

---

## Recent advances and ongoing research

Recent research highlights **prolactin's role in metabolism**, immune regulation, and behavior [^113AmbM3] [^112fu9rL] [^115DRMo7]. Studies explore prolactin receptor antagonists and novel therapies for hyperprolactinemia and prolactinomas [^116S1dNQ].

---

Prolactin is a **multifunctional hormone** with broad roles in reproduction, metabolism, immunity, and behavior. Its secretion is tightly regulated, and altered levels are associated with significant clinical conditions. Accurate measurement and targeted therapies are essential for management.

### Guidelines of the pituitary society for the diagnosis and management of prolactinomas [^113Yr5fr]. Clinical Endocrinology (2006). Low credibility.

In June 2005, an ad hoc Expert Committee formed by the Pituitary Society convened during the 9th International Pituitary Congress in San Diego, California. Members of this committee consisted of invited international experts in the field, and included endocrinologists and neurosurgeons with recognized expertise in the management of prolactinomas. Discussions were held that included all interested participants to the Congress and resulted in formulation of these guidelines, which represent the current recommendations on the diagnosis and management of prolactinomas based upon comprehensive analysis and synthesis of all available data.

### Association between prolactin and incidence of cardiovascular risk factors in the framingham heart study [^115ppZH9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Finally, the lack of associations observed between prolactin and changes in adiposity and body composition is not consistent with results published in primarily clinical studies. Prolactinomas producing high levels of prolactin are typically associated with weight gain. 4 In addition, a study in obese women found that increased BMI and VAT are associated with an increased prolactin secretion rate. 8 Similar to our findings, however, a previous cross‐sectional community‐based study did not find an association between BMI and prolactin in either men or women. 9 This study excluded participants with pituitary disease and, with this exclusion, likely removed most persons with prolactin levels outside of the physiological range. Our exclusion of participants with abnormally elevated prolactin may have similarly contributed to the lack of associations we observed, if these associations are better observed with very elevated prolactin.

Potential Mechanisms

Several mechanisms potentially explain the association between prolactin and hypertension. Studies in rats have demonstrated that high prolactin has chronotropic and vasoconstrictive effects. 27 A physiological study of 27 men with untreated hypertension and normal prolactin found that diurnal peaks in prolactin coincided with reduced endothelial function, which may play a role in elevating blood pressure. 28

Higher baseline prolactin may also reflect perturbations in other hormonal axes known to affect blood pressure and lipids, thus explaining both our hypertension and HDL cholesterol findings. Elevated prolactin may result from untreated hypothyroidism because hypothalamic thyrotropin‐releasing hormone, which is commonly elevated in hypothyroidism, stimulates both prolactin synthesis and release from the pituitary. 29 Hypothyroidism is associated with hypertension and elevations in HDL cholesterol. 30, 31 Nevertheless, this mechanism is speculative.

The association we observed between elevated prolactin and diabetes in men may be related to a possible mechanism of sex hormone–binding globulin, a glycoprotein that binds to androgens and estrogens and mediates their interaction with hormone receptors. 32, 33 Prolactin has been found to inhibit production of sex hormone–binding globulin in vitro. 34 Low sex hormone–binding globulin has been prospectively associated with increased odds of incident diabetes. 33, 35, 36 Although the mechanism and causality of this association has not been fully characterized, it is possible that elevated prolactin may influence diabetes risk by inhibiting production of sex hormone–binding globulin.

### 30 years after: CNS actions of prolactin: sources, mechanisms and physiological significance [^115DRMo7]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2019). Medium credibility.

Our understanding of the neural actions of prolactin (PRL) and its biochemical basis has expanded greatly over the past three decades. During this time, major progress has been made, including clarification of how PRL accesses the brain, identification of the PRL receptor and the sites where it is expressed within the brain, determination of the neurochemical mechanism of action of PRL and its effect on genomic expression in neurones, identification of the neural sites where PRL acts to stimulate maternal behaviour and related affective states, and exploration of how life experiences impact neural PRL receptor activity and actions. The next 30 years promise to reveal a myriad of basic and clinical findings regarding new roles for PRL and a greater indepth understanding of how and where PRL affects physiological and behavioural processes.

### Radioiodine uptake in non-lactating mammary glands: evidence for a causative role of hyperprolactinemia [^111nDTdE]. Thyroid (2007). Low credibility.

Context

Radioiodine uptake is rarely observed in normal non-lactating breast tissue. Investigation of the in vivo regulation of iodide uptake in breast tissue may be useful for the induction of radioiodine uptake in breast cancer tissue for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

Case Reports

We report the cases of two post-menopausal women who underwent radioiodine therapy for papillary thyroid carcinoma and in whom breast uptake of radioiodine on post-therapy whole body scan (WBS) was observed.

Methods and Results

In both patients, elevated serum prolactin levels (123 ng/mL in patient 1 and 48 ng/mL in patient 2) were documented at the time when radioiodine uptake in the breast was observed. The hyperprolactinemia was due to prolonged treatment with the anti-dopaminergic neuroleptic risperidone in Case 1, and chronic renal failure in Case 2. When prolactin levels were normalized (by withdrawal of risperidone in Case 1 and with cabergoline in Case 2), breast tissue uptake was no longer evident on WBS.

Conclusion

These cases provide the first documented correlation between serum levels of endogenous prolactin and radioiodine uptake by involuted breast tissue in humans.

### Prolactin in headache and migraine: a systematic review of clinical studies [^114RYXXw]. Cephalalgia (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To systemically review clinical studies investigating the role of prolactin and its receptors in headache and migraine.

Background

Migraine prevalence is more common in women compared to men. As prolactin is a crucial regulator of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis, prolactin and its receptors might contribute to signaling mechanisms underlying migraine.

Methods

In this systematic review, we searched PubMed and EMBASE with the terms: prolactin, hyperprolactinemia, macroprolactinemia, hypoprolactinemia, migraine, headache, head pain and trigeminal pain pathway for clinical studies investigating prolactin signaling in headache and migraine. Two reviewers independently screened 841 articles for population, intervention, comparison, outcome, and study design. Studies were restricted to the English language and were excluded if they had a nonexperimental methodology.

Results

Nineteen clinical studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the qualitative and quantitative analysis. The main findings were that serum prolactin levels were found to be higher in individuals with migraine compared to healthy controls, and prolactinomas (prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas) were correlated with higher incidence of headache in otherwise healthy individuals and migraine attacks in individuals with migraine.

Conclusion

Considerable evidence suggests a key role of prolactin and its receptors in migraine pathophysiology. Further randomized and placebo-controlled clinical studies targeting prolactin signaling are needed to further clarify influences of prolactin in migraine attack initiation.

### Cabergoline [^111shfcC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

There were no teratogenic effects in the presence of maternal toxicity in mice given cabergoline at doses up to 8 mg/kg/day (approximately 55 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area) during the period of organogenesis.
A dose of 0.012 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.14 times the maximum recommended human dose) administered during the period of organogenesis in rats caused an increase in post-implantation loss. This finding is likely due to the role of prolactin in implantation in rats and is not thought to be relevant to humans.
At doses of 0.5 mg/kg/day (approximately 19 times the maximum recommended human dose) administered during the period of organogenesis in rabbits, cabergoline caused maternal toxicity characterized by a loss of body weight and decreased food consumption. Doses of 4 mg/kg/day (approximately 150 times the maximum recommended human dose) administered during the period of organogenesis in the rabbit caused an increased occurrence of various malformations. However, in another study in rabbits, no treatment-related malformations or embryofetal toxicity were observed at doses up to 8 mg/kg/day (approximately 300 times the maximum recommended human dose).

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

CABERGOLINE is not recommended in postpartum women who are breastfeeding or who are planning to breastfeed. Avoid use of CABERGOLINE for the inhibition or suppression of physiologic lactation [see Indications and Usage (1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of CABERGOLINE in pediatric patients have not been established.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of CABERGOLINE did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult patients.

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

The use of CABERGOLINE in patients with severe hepatic impairment (HI) (Child-Pugh C) is not recommended. When using CABERGOLINE in patients with moderate HI (Child-Pugh B) increase monitoring of CABERGOLINE-associated adverse reactions. The recommendations for use of CABERGOLINE in patients with mild HI (Child Pugh A) is the same as those with normal hepatic function.

Patients with moderate or severe HI had increased cabergoline exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may increase the risk of CABERGOLINE-associated adverse reactions.

### Prolactin-related adverse events and change in prolactin levels in pediatric patients given antipsychotics for schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders: a systematic review [^113gb6tq]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

This review is useful in that the process and design was well structured, with screening and data extraction conducted using a duplicate, consensus-based approach. Additionally, the body of evidence considered was broad, including both RCTs and observational studies. While observational studies may lack the methodological rigor of RCTs, they may still be considered an important source of information on treatment efficacy and safety. Despite this, this review presents some limitations. First, few trials were identified from the available literature and many were characterized by small sample sizes. Secondly, the observational studies suffered from significant heterogeneity in study populations, both in comparison to one another and to the RCT evidence base. Similarly, the patients represented in the evidence base were primarily Caucasians, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to the wider patient population. Follow-up time, prior treatment experience, and patient diagnoses also differed significantly in the observational studies. Thirdly, estimates of dispersion were large in each of the RCTs. Finally, while the mechanism is clear between prolactin and breast development/lactation, there is no conclusive research to confirm this association epidemiologically. In a similar vein, it was not possible, from the included studies, to directly associate changes in prolactin levels with patient adverse events. While this review was focused on pediatric patients with schizophrenia, in order to present outcomes for a well-defined clinical area, it must also be recognized that the potential for treatment-related prolactin elevation is not limited to this population. The risk and effects of prolactin elevation are an important clinical concern in other diagnostic areas and should be explored.

### Circulating prolactin level in juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus and its correlation with disease activity: a case control study [^116RimWL]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Prolactin (PRL) is a lactogenic hormone and an immunomodulator that enhances lymphocyte survival, stimulation, and proliferation. It is released by the anterior pituitary gland and extrapituitary sites as immune cells. Prolactin stimulates immune cells by binding to the prolactin receptor (PRL-R), which is a member of the hematopoietic cytokine receptor superfamily, allowing prolactin to have cytokine and endocrinological roles. Earlier studies have shown that prolactin is implicated in autoimmunity and has a role in regulating both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses. Also, it could influence the onset and severity of autoimmune illnesses like SLE and others. It was reported that serum prolactin levels were increased in SLE patients of both sexes, with an incidence of 20–30%, particularly in active disease. Moreover, when bromocriptine is used to suppress the secretion of prolactin, it has a favourable outcome in some SLE patients. There are conflicting results as regards the role of prolactin in SLE initiation and disease severity. Some studies found that prolactin level was not correlated with SLE disease activity and that prolactin level did not vary significantly when compared to control subjects. Alternatively, other studies suggested that prolactin was associated with the involvement of major organs such as lupus nephritis and neuropsychiatric lupus. In our study, we tested for serum prolactin in juvenile SLE patients compared to the control group, aiming to reveal its role in disease pathogenicity and severity.

### Quality of life in prolactinoma: a systematic review [^113h9NfT]. Pituitary (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prolactinoma (functional lactotroph pituitary neuroendocrine tumours) are the most common pituitary adenoma encountered in daily practice. These tumours come to clinical attention due to sellar mass effect, secondary hypogonadism, and the peripheral effects of prolactin. Through these mechanisms the tumour, and its treatment, can cause significant detriment to physical, social, and emotional functioning. Understanding these effects on patient reported quality of life (QOL) would provide insights into therapeutic targets to optimise patient outcomes. Here, we review the literature on QOL in patients with prolactinomas to elucidate the patient and therapeutic factors that influence patient wellbeing.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyperprolactinemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112pb9Wo]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hyperprolactinemia, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients, monitoring, ES 2011 guidelines recommend to do not assess serum prolactin levels during pregnancy in patients with prolactinomas.

### Adverse body composition and lipid parameters in patients with prolactinoma: a case-control study [^111AhKyN]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this case control study, men and women with prolactinoma had higher BMI than controls, but only men with prolactinoma also had higher body fat content compared to healthy men. In line with most published data, we found evidence of impaired lipid metabolism in untreated patients with prolactinoma and an amelioration after initiation of cabergoline therapy. Concerning glucose metabolism, we found no alteration in patients with prolactinoma, which parallels our previously published data from a retrospective prolactinoma cohort.

Our findings of an elevated BMI in men and women and higher body fat in men with prolactinoma compared to controls in our study supports previously published data and might be explained by the increases in food intake and weight gain due to chronic hyperprolactinaemia, as shown in animal models. Elevated levels of prolactin seem to cause a functional blockade of dopaminergic tone. As dopaminergic tone increases energy expenditure and causes a reduction in food intake, a blockade would promote weight gain.

Further, prolactin has been shown to directly stimulate the development of adipose tissue, as shown in a model of prolactin-deficient mice and in studies in humans. This direct effect on adipose tissue in humans might be exerted via four prolactin receptor isoforms found in human adipose tissue. Further, prolactin might suppress lipid storage as well as the release of adipokines such as adiponectin, interleukin-6 and possibly leptin. Additionally, hyperprolactinaemia-induced hypogonadism could contribute to an adverse body composition especially in men, as androgen deficiency itself increases body fat and facilitates lean mass reduction. This has been shown in men with prostate cancer on androgen deprivation therapy and by studies of testosterone replacement enhancing skeletal muscle, decreasing fat mass and increasing lean mass. In untreated men with prolactinoma, higher fat percentage in the arms and the total body has been previously observed, whereas our data even show higher body fat at all six sites investigated.

### Metabolic abnormalities in patients with prolactinoma: response to treatment with cabergoline [^111NiaiT]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Prolactin (PRL) exerts a wide variety of effects on metabolism, in addition to its well-known actions on lactation and gonadal function. Several animal and few human studies (especially in men) describe a higher body weight in patients with hyperprolactinemia (HPL), the exact mechanism of which is not clear. A combination of factors like decreased dopaminergic tone, low adiponectin, hypogonadism with or without associated leptin resistance could contribute to weight gain. Hyperprolactinemia has also been linked to alteration in glucose homeostasis, insulin sensitivity and lipid parameters. Hyperglycemia with or without insulin resistance has been demonstrated in men and women with HPL because of its effects on the growth of islet cells and insulin production. Many studies have demonstrated adverse lipid profiles such as increased low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides (TG) and decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in people with HPL. This could be due to a decrease in lipoprotein lipase activity in fat cells and subsequent effects on adipose tissue. Effects of normalization of PRL [with dopamine agonists (DA)] on body weight, glucose and lipid homeostasis is a matter of debate and is being explored. There is some disagreement on metabolic abnormalities in people with HPL and so is its response to treatment with DA. Aims of the present research were: (1) to study the metabolic abnormalities in people with prolactinoma compared to healthy age, gender and body mass index (BMI) matched controls and (2) the effect of normalization of PRL with cabergoline treatment on these metabolic abnormalities.

### Neuroendocrine regulation of prolactin secretion during late pregnancy: easing the transition into lactation [^113zVig3]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2005). Low credibility.

Prolactin is an anterior pituitary hormone critical for maintaining pregnancy and lactation. Under normal conditions, prolactin secretion is tightly regulated by inhibitory dopaminergic neuronal systems within the mediobasal hypothalamus in a process known as short-loop negative feedback. This review focuses on neuroendocrine adaptations to prolactin negative feedback during late pregnancy. It is suggested that, in terms of prolactin regulation, late pregnancy is a transition period into lactation because many of the neuroendocrine adaptations promoting hyperprolactinemia in lactation develop during late pregnancy. As a consequence, the maternal brain is geared to provide unrestrained prolactin release critical for milk production, maternal care and thus survival of the offspring before parturition. The mechanisms responsible for these changes are discussed.

### Recombinant human prolactin for the treatment of lactation insufficiency [^114zs5B6]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Context

Lactation insufficiency has many aetiologies including complete or relative prolactin deficiency. Exogenous prolactin may increase breast milk volume in this subset. We hypothesized that recombinant human prolactin (r-hPRL) would increase milk volume in mothers with prolactin deficiency and mothers of preterm infants with lactation insufficiency.

Design

Study 1: R-hPRL was administered in an open-label trial to mothers with prolactin deficiency. Study 2: R-hPRL was administered in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to mothers with lactation insufficiency that developed while pumping breast milk for their preterm infants.

Patients

Study 1: Mothers with prolactin deficiency (n = 5). Study 2: Mothers of premature infants exclusively pumping breast milk (n = 11).

Design

Study 1: R-hPRL (60 μg/kg) was administered subcutaneously every 12 h for 28 days. Study 2: Mothers of preterm infants were randomized to receive r-hPRL (60 μg/kg), placebo or r-hPRL alternating with placebo every 12 h for 7 days.

Measurements

Change in milk volume.

Study 1: Peak prolactin (27·9 ± 17·3 to 194·6 ± 19·5 μg/l; P < 0·003) and milk volume (3·4 ± 1·6 to 66·1 ± 8·3 ml/day; P < 0·001) increased with r-hPRL administration. Study 2: Peak prolactin increased in mothers treated with r-hPRL every 12 h (n = 3; 79·3 ± 55·4 to 271·3 ± 36·7 μg/l; P < 0·05) and daily (101·4 ± 61·5 vs 178·9 ± 45·9 μg/l; P < 0·04), but milk volume increased only in the group treated with r-hPRL every 12 h (53·5 ± 48·5 to 235·0 ± 135·7 ml/day; P < 0·02).

Conclusion

Twice daily r-hPRL increases milk volume in mothers with prolactin deficiency and in preterm mothers with lactation insufficiency.

### Prolactin-a pleiotropic factor in health and disease [^115ETrsb]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2019). High credibility.

The principal role of prolactin in mammals is the regulation of lactation. Prolactin is a hormone that is mainly synthesized and secreted by lactotroph cells in the anterior pituitary gland. Prolactin signalling occurs via a unique transmembrane prolactin receptor (PRL-R). The structure of the PRL-R has now been elucidated and is similar to that of many biologically fundamental receptors of the class 1 haematopoietic cytokine receptor family such as the growth hormone receptor. The PRL-R is expressed in a wide array of tissues, and a growing number of biological processes continue to be attributed to prolactin. In this Review, we focus on the newly discovered roles of prolactin in human health and disease, particularly its involvement in metabolic homeostasis including body weight control, adipose tissue, skin and hair follicles, pancreas, bone, the adrenal response to stress, the control of lactotroph cell homeostasis and maternal behaviour. New data concerning the pathological states of hypoprolactinaemia and hyperprolactinaemia will also be presented and discussed.

### Automated segmentation of the pituitary and pineal glands [^1112JnUm]. Human Brain Mapping (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

1.1 Background and Significance

The pituitary and pineal glands (see Figure 1) are two structures within the brain that play pivotal roles in the human endocrine system. The pituitary gland (Figure 1A), also called the hypophysis, resides inferior to the hypothalamus and rests in a fossa of the sphenoid bone directly above the sphenoid sinus. It consists of two lobes: one anterior (adenohypophysis) and the other posterior (neurohypophysis). While both lobes are responsible for hormone secretion modulated by the hypothalamus, there exist several key differences between the cellular composition and functions of each (Asa; Eroschenko and di Fiore; Hall). The anterior pituitary is composed primarily of endocrine cells, giving it a glandular structure (Hall). These cells produce and secrete six different tropic hormones that affect different organs throughout the body. These include somatotropin (growth hormone), which influences all aspects of human development; thyrotropin, which stimulates the thyroid gland; follicle‐simulating hormone and lutropin, which both influence the menstrual cycle and sexual development; and prolactin, which stimulates lactation (Sadiq and Tadi). In contrast, the posterior pituitary secretes only two hormones: oxytocin, which plays a role in various behavioral and emotional functions, and vasopressin, which is responsible for maintaining osmotic homeostasis throughout the body (Sadiq and Tadi). The neurohypophysis consists mainly of axonal projections that begin in the hypothalamus and descend through the infundibulum, or pituitary stalk (Hall).

### Approach to the patient with prolactinoma [^117FQPjR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN PROLACTIN AND FERTILITY

Hyperprolactinemia is the most common cause of secondary hypogonadism and infertility in both sexes. In infertile women, PRL excess as the main cause of infertility has been found to vary from 7% to 20% of cases, being lower than that reported in women with amenorrhea and/or galactorrhea, but at least 10-fold higher than that of the general population. The impact of PRL excess on the reproductive axis reflects its peculiar actions at both the central and peripheral levels. At the central level, PRL modulates the reproductive axis by directly suppressing kisspeptin secretion, thus lowering GnRH activation and gonadotropins secretion, so promoting hypogonadism and infertility. At the peripheral level, PRL plays a direct inhibitory effect on sexual hormone synthesis and secretion. In women, PRL inhibits estrogen and progesterone synthesis. In men, PRL receptors have been identified on Leydig cells, Sertoli cells, and epithelial cells of efferent ducts, suggesting a potential role for PRL in promoting steroidogenesis, spermatogenesis, and secretory/adsorptive functions of male reproductive organs. In infertile men, the prevalence of PRL increase as the main cause of infertility is still unknown; nevertheless, endocrine disorders, including hyperprolactinemia, reportedly account for only 2% to 4% of cases of male infertility.

### Drug insight: prolactin-receptor antagonists, a novel approach to treatment of unresolved systemic and local hyperprolactinemia? [^116S1dNQ]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2006). Medium credibility.

Prolactin is a polypeptide hormone whose major biological actions are related to normal lactation and reproduction. Abnormally high prolactin levels, referred to as hyperprolactinemia, can result in various reproductive disorders. Currently, therapeutic management of hyperprolactinemia relies on dopamine agonists, since dopamine is the primary physiological suppressor of pituitary prolactin production. Epidemiologic studies have shown that prolactin levels in the high-normal range, as well as medications that interfere with dopamine action (e.g. certain antipsychotic drugs), might correlate with increased breast cancer risk. In addition to circulating prolactin, it is now well established that prolactin is also produced locally within various tissues, including breast and prostate. Increasing evidence, mainly from animal studies at present, suggests that excess locally produced prolactin may promote the growth of breast and prostate tumors via an autocrine or paracrine mechanism. These findings have renewed the interest in finding alternative strategies to suppress prolactin actions when dopamine agonists are ineffective. Our studies of the relationship between prolactin structure and function have resulted in the development of pure prolactin-receptor antagonists. These molecules prevent endogenous prolactin from exerting its actions via a competitive mechanism for receptor binding. In this review, we discuss the possible future therapeutic utility of this novel class of compounds.

### Medical causes and consequences of hyperprolactinaemia. A context for psychiatrists [^111Zyoaj]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2008). Low credibility.

Hyperprolactinaemia is the commonest endocrine disorder of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and can lead to both short-term sexual dysfunction and galactorrhoea, and long-term loss of bone mineral density. Prolactin is secreted from the anterior pituitary gland under the influence of dopamine, which exerts a tonic inhibitory effect on prolactin secretion. Physiological regulators of prolactin secretion include many different types of 'stress' and sleep. Disruption of the normal control of prolactin secretion results in hyperprolactinaemia from pathological and pharmacological causes. The administration of antipsychotic medication is responsible for the high prevalence of hyperprolactinaemia in people with severe mental illness. Physiological hyperprolactinaemia, such as pregnancy and lactation, should be distinguished from pathological causes to prevent unnecessary investigation and treatment. The causes, consequences and management of hyperprolactinaemia are discussed in this article.

### Prolactin: a pleiotropic neuroendocrine hormone [^111pWBLa]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2008). Low credibility.

The neuroendocrine control of prolactin secretion is unlike that of any other pituitary hormone. It is predominantly inhibited by the hypothalamus and, in the absence of a regulatory feedback hormone, it acts directly in the brain to suppress its own secretion. In addition to this short-loop feedback action in the brain, prolactin has been reported to influence a wide range of other brain functions. There have been few attempts to rationalise why a single hormone might exert such a range of distinct and seemingly unrelated neuroendocrine functions. In this review, we highlight some of the original studies that first characterised the unusual features of prolactin neuroendocrinology, and then attempt to identify areas of new progress and/or controversy. Finally, we discuss a hypothesis that provides a unifying explanation for the pleiotrophic actions of prolactin in the brain.

### Prolactin acts as a potent survival factor for human breast cancer cell lines [^115H5NGk]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Human breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women from Western societies, and a large study of the epidemiology has demonstrated strong associations between human prolactin and risk of breast cancer. Despite a number of studies showing that prolactin promotes cell proliferation in some breast cancer cell lines, our investigations showed that prolactin had no effect on cell proliferation in any cell line over the 48 h tested. This suggested that the breast cancer cell lines must be producing their own prolactin as has been demonstrated previously. We confirmed that the breast cancer cells lines we were studying did contain prolactin and that the levels varied between lines. The T47D cells contained the highest levels, followed by MDA-MB-231 cells and MCF-7 cells and the lowest levels were found in the Hs578T cells. These findings are consistent with a previous study which measured levels of prolactin and found that T47D cells produced appreciably higher levels of prolactin in comparison to the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells.

Whereas some studies have reported that neutralising prolactin antibodies caused a decrease in proliferation in MCF-7 and T47D cells, we did not observe any such effects on cell growth (data not shown). However, we did find that the cells responded in the presence of a prolactin-neutralising antibody with the induction of apoptosis, which has also been observed by others. This suggested that the endogenous prolactin was not sufficient to drive proliferation, but was crucial for cell survival. In support of prolactin being a potent survival factor, we observed that the sensitivity of the breast cancer cell lines to the physiological inducer of apoptosis, C2-ceramide, appeared relative to the levels of endogenous prolactin that they contained. We determined that T47D cells (highest levels of prolactin) were more resistant to the induction of cell death by C2-ceramide than the Hs578T cells (lowest levels of prolactin). To confirm these observations, we then induced apoptosis and showed for the first time that exogenously added prolactin does act as a potent survival factor against C2-ceramide-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines. In addition, we demonstrated that a prolactin-neutralising antibody in combination with C2-ceramide caused an anticipated, additive increase in cell death.

ABM Clinical Protocol #9 — background and physiology relevant to galactogogues states that galactagogues are medications or other substances believed to assist initiation, maintenance, or augmentation of maternal milk supply, and notes that once lactation is established there is no direct correlation between serum prolactin levels and the volume of milk produced in lactating women. It describes hormonal control, including that systemic endocrine control of other supporting hormones is important and that prolactin secretion functions in a negative feedback system in which dopamine serves as an inhibitor, with increases in prolactin when dopamine decreases. It further explains that once secretory activation has occurred and milk supply is established, the rate of milk synthesis is mainly controlled locally in the mammary gland by autocrine control, and emphasizes breast emptying mechanics by stating that lactating breasts are never completely empty and that inadequate drainage causes milk production to decline, whereas more frequent and thorough drainage typically increases milk secretion with both immediate and delayed effects.

### The prolactin gene: a paradigm of tissue-specific gene regulation with complex temporal transcription dynamics [^112oLzCS]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2012). Low credibility.

Numerous molecules have been identified that influence prolactin expression levels, mainly through extensive studies in rats. The hypothalamus imparts significant control on prolactin production and secretion through the action of several neuropeptides and neurotransmitters. Dopamine is one of the most important hypothalamic mediators, maintaining prolactin gene expression and protein secretion under tonic inhibition, with rhythmic dopamine release influencing daily prolactin surges. Prolactin expression is also regulated by steroids, hormones and cytokines produced throughout the body. Thus, the level of prolactin expression can be considered as a balance between inhibitory and stimulatory influences originating from numerous organ systems. The integration of these signals is achieved by several intracellular messengers, including the phosphatidylinositol pathway, which increases intracellular calcium levels and activates protein kinase C; cAMP, which activates protein kinase A; and the mitogen-activated protein pathway. Activation of protein kinase C and increases in intracellular calcium and cAMP stimulate human prolactin gene expression, suggesting that these pathways are also operative in humans.

Numerous protein-binding sites are involved in mediating changes in prolactin expression levels. Pit-1 binding sites are required for responses to calcium and cAMP signalling, although whether this is mediated by Pit-1 or other factors (e.g. prolactin regulatory element binding protein) remains under question. AP-1, Ets, Pitx factors and ER binding sites also mediate responses to transcriptional stimuli.

Differences between rats and humans exist in their response to regulators of prolactin expression, as exemplified by oestrogen, which has a major influence on rat prolactin expression but may have a more limited action in humans. Oestrogen causes large increases in rat prolactin expression through synergistic activity with Pit-1. In humans, modest responses to oestrogen are detectable in cell line models and changes in oestrogen levels in human physiology do not always equate to changes in prolactin expression levels. Overall, these data suggest that prolactin expression levels result from the integration of numerous intracellular signalling pathways via the modified action of a number of transcription factors.

### The relationship between bone and reproductive hormones beyond estrogens and androgens [^115jPZVq]. Endocrine Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Prolactin

PRL is a peptide hormone present in all vertebrates, with the mature peptide composed of 199 amino acids. It is synthesized and secreted by lactotroph cells of the anterior pituitary gland, and exerts its biological actions by binding to its receptor, the PRL receptor (PRLR), a type 1 cytokine receptor.

Beyond the pituitary, PRL is produced by many other cells and tissues, including several brain regions, lacrimal and sweat glands, thymus, lymph nodes, breast, spleen, skin, myometrium, decidual cells of the placenta, and bone marrow. In the majority of these regions, the physiological role of prolactin remains to be determined. Evidence suggests that PRL participates in excess of 300 identified biological processes in various vertebrates, including lactation, reproduction, metabolism, osmoregulation, behavior, growth and development, and immune regulation and protection. However, patients with PRL-secreting pituitary adenomas typically present with symptoms attributable to a space-occupying lesion, HPG axis dysfunction, and/or galactorrhea, rather than impairments of the aforementioned functions suggesting a lesser relevant role.

In animals and humans, circulating PRL is significantly elevated during pregnancy and lactation, along with other corresponding changes in circulating estrogens and progesterone amongst others. Notably, these physiological states are recognized to induce a maternal bone-resorptive state to provide the necessary calcium for fetal and neonatal skeletal growth and development. As such, the potential role of PRL in bone physiology has been the focus of several studies.

### What can we learn from rodents about prolactin in humans? [^116qQoEi]. Endocrine Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Prolactin (PRL) is a 23-kDa protein hormone that binds to a single-span membrane receptor, a member of the cytokine receptor superfamily, and exerts its action via several interacting signaling pathways. PRL is a multifunctional hormone that affects multiple reproductive and metabolic functions and is also involved in tumorigenicity. In addition to being a classical pituitary hormone, PRL in humans is produced by many tissues throughout the body where it acts as a cytokine. The objective of this review is to compare and contrast multiple aspects of PRL, from structure to regulation, and from physiology to pathology in rats, mice, and humans. At each juncture, questions are raised whether, or to what extent, data from rodents are relevant to PRL homeostasis in humans. Most current knowledge on PRL has been obtained from studies with rats and, more recently, from the use of transgenic mice. Although this information is indispensable for understanding PRL in human health and disease, there is sufficient disparity in the control of the production, distribution, and physiological functions of PRL among these species to warrant careful and judicial extrapolation to humans.

### Prolactin-secreting adenomas: pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management [^115yZ5oQ]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Hyperprolactinaemia can result from physiological causes, pharmacological agents, or pathological conditions such as prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas and other pituitary stalk-compressing masses. Sporadic prolactinomas are the most common functioning pituitary adenomas, with a female predominance during reproductive years. In men, these adenomas are usually larger and more aggressive. Prolactinomas are characterised by positive immunostaining for prolactin, pituitary-specific positive transcription factor 1, and oestrogen receptor α. Dopamine agonists, particularly cabergoline, are typically used as primary therapy. Treatment with up to 2·0 mg per week of cabergoline for at least 6 months normalises prolactin concentrations, achieves adenoma shrinkage of at least 30%, and restores gonadal function in most patients. Transsphenoidal surgery is increasingly used as primary therapy for small prolactinomas given a high chance of remission; transsphenoidal surgery is also indicated for patients with dopamine agonist intolerance or resistance. Radiotherapy is reserved for treatment-refractory prolactinomas. Multidisciplinary management and an individualised approach are key to maximising therapeutic responsiveness and optimising outcomes. In this Review, we assess evidence relating to pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of prolactinomas, and highlight opportunities for future research.

### Circadian rhythm and sleep disruption: causes, metabolic consequences, and countermeasures [^112Hte5u]. Endocrine Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Rhythmic growth hormone (GH) secretion is another important determinant of daily changes in substrate oxidation. Although a minor influence of the circadian system has sometimes been detected, sleep has a dominant influence on GH secretion. GH has an acrophase near the onset of slow wave sleep (SWS), and GH profiles are further characterized by episodic surges a few hours after meals. The GH rhythm differs a little between the sexes. Together with insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), GH aids nitrogen retention during high energy availability; during reduced energy availability, as occurs during sleep, GH stimulates lipolysis and ketogenesis, inducing insulin resistance and thereby sparing glucose and protein oxidation.

Like GH, prolactin is primarily synthesized and secreted by the anterior pituitary and fulfils > 300 biological actions, including roles in homeostasis, lactation, and reproduction. Prolactin also influences appetite in a species-specific way, and chronic hyperprolactinemia is associated with increased body mass in humans. Furthermore, prolactin has roles in lipid metabolism, largely reducing lipid storage in adipocytes, and also affects glucose metabolism by stimulating insulin secretion. A circadian rhythm in prolactin is evident in constant routine protocols, of larger amplitude in women and with an acrophase in the rest phase. Subcutaneous prolactin injections prolong rapid eye movement sleep in rats, and prolactin is also associated with SWS in humans.

Melatonin synthesis occurs during darkness and increases sleep propensity in humans, which may be related to melatonin's hypothermic effects. Melatonin may have important roles in metabolic regulation, perhaps helping prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia by inhibiting insulin secretion. Because this was demonstrated in mice, however, different responses may be apparent in humans. Interestingly, the MTNR1B T2DM risk variant rs10830963 has been linked to prolonged melatonin synthesis duration and delayed melatonin offset phase in humans. Because melatonin inhibits glucose-stimulated insulin secretion ex vivo, it is plausible that extended melatonin synthesis into waking could contribute to T2DM risk, particularly among carriers with early sleep times. As melatonin also exerts receptor-independent effects in free radical scavenging, melatonin perhaps also contributes to temporal regulation of immune function, although further research is required.

Finally, an acrophase in leptin secretion during the rest phase may contribute to reduced appetite for most foodstuffs in the biological morning in humans, permitting consolidated sleep despite declining energy availability. This hypothesis is not supported by the finding that nocturnal rats also have an acrophase in leptin secretion during darkness (their active phase), although it is possible that leptin has different roles in diurnal and nocturnal species.

### Prolactin acts as a potent survival factor for human breast cancer cell lines [^115k9veZ]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Prolactin is a 23 kDa peptide hormone released from the lactotroph cell populations of the anterior pituitary gland. Prolactin has a well established role in stimulating breast growth and differentiation in puberty as well as lactation during pregnancy. Prolactin binds with its cell-surface receptor, which dimerises on prolactin binding triggering intracellular signalling. A hormone such as prolactin, whose normal action is to promote cell proliferation and differentiation, was soon identified as a potential candidate for the progression of breast cancer, where cells are proliferating and surviving inappropriately.

Indeed, the role of prolactin in rodent mammary cancer soon became clear. Transgenic female mice overexpressing the rat prolactin gene spontaneously developed mammary carcinomas. Conversely, drug-induced hypoprolactinaemia retarded tumour growth.

Studies of the epidemiology have found that high serum prolactin levels were associated with known breast cancer risk factors such as parity status and mammographic breast density. In addition, a prospective epidemiological study by Hankinson et al found strong evidence indicating that high serum prolactin levels were a risk factor for breast cancer in postmenopausal women.

In the human, clinical trials were undertaken with the aim of reducing serum prolactin levels using dopamine agonists such as bromocriptine (in vivo, dopamine inhibits prolactin release from the anterior pituitary gland). Although circulating prolactin levels were dramatically reduced, no therapeutic benefit in the breast cancer patients was seen. The failure of these clinical trials resulted in a diminished interest in prolactin as a therapeutic target in human breast cancer.

However, studies began to accumulate indicating that patients with surgical ablation of the anterior pituitary gland still had detectable levels of prolactin, which suggested the existence of extrapituitary sites of prolactin production. Indeed, several laboratories have since demonstrated the synthesis of prolactin in breast cancer cells and normal breast tissue, raising the possibility that prolactin may act in an autocrine/paracrine manner within the mammary gland. mRNA for prolactin and its receptor has been found in normal breast tissues and in primary human breast cancers; while both receptor mRNA and protein are expressed in nearly all human breast cancers, they are not generally overexpressed. Overexpression of the receptor mRNA has been demonstrated in some breast cancer cell lines. Recent studies showing inhibition of cell growth and survival of breast cancer cells in the presence of prolactin blocking antibodies and receptor antagonists also support an autocrine/paracrine loop of locally produced prolactin. These data provide an explanation for the failure of the dopamine agonist trials, since lowering prolactin release from the pituitary gland would have had no effect on the proliferation of breast cancer cells initiated by a local source of prolactin.

### Chemiluminescence systems; do all lead to same results in prolactin analysis? [^112MtZia]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Background

In the human genome prolactin (PRL) molecule is arranged in a single chain of amino acids with three intra-molecular disulfide bonds between six cysteine residues and is synthesized and secreted by the lactotroph cells of the anterior pituitary gland. Three major variant of PRL can be found in the blood: monomeric, big and macroprolactin. Multiple circulating variants of PRL are identifiable on Gel Filtration Chromatography. The monomeric form has a molecular mass of ~23 kDa and accounts for most of the PRL present in normal individuals. Prolactin is normally present in low amounts in both men and non-pregnant women and mainly its level is regulated by dopamine.

Regardless of hypersecretion of prolactin with idiopatic reasons that may lead to hyperprolactinemia due to macroprolactinemia, the most common cause of elevated PRL level (hyperprolactinemia) is prolactin-producing adenomas or prolactinomas. Adenomas occur in both men and women with abnormal reproductive function or with galactorrihea. However, it is more commonly diagnosed in women who are less than 50 years old. Furthermore, most adenomas occur sporadically and rarely in families as a condition called the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 syndrome.

The PRL level is measured in a blood serum sample and increased result can range from elevated to multiple times the upper limit of normal. Larger adenomas cause higher PRL levels and elevated concentrations are found in up to 17% of such cases. There are other causes of increased PRL level in serum such as use of various drugs, compression of the pituitary stalk, presence of macroprolactin, renal failure, cirrhosis or idiopathic hyperprolactinemia are diagnoses that may increase PRL level.

Different methods are used to measure PRL level. They are mostly immunoassay based such as RIA, ELISA, CLIA, ECL. Studies have indicated that Gel Filtration Chromatography is the gold standard for quantification of PRL molecular forms in serum. However, it is slow, costly and labour intensive.

Although precise laboratory techniques demonstrating hyperprolactinemia are essential for the accurate diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of patients during medical therapy or post surgery, the comparison of the measured values among different systems are difficult. Because the methods are not identical in different laboratories and the reference ranges are different for each. This is one of the main challenges in PRL measurements among laboratories.

In the present study we compared the results of two chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) methods to determine serum prolactin level in 44 female patients serum sample(age range 21–65 years).

### Quality of life in prolactinoma: a systematic review [^114WwRbA]. Pituitary (2024). Medium credibility.

Putative effects of Hyperprolactinemia on QOL

Classically confined to the initiation and maintenance of lactation in females, it has become clear that prolactin exerts a range of metabolic, immunologic, and reproductive effects.

Hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism is the most common presenting symptom of hyperprolactinemia, manifesting as oligo-amenorrhoea in pre-menopausal women and impotence in males. Hyperprolactinemia reduces the frequency and amplitude of GnRH secretory pulses, and downstream reductions in LH secretory pulses lead to gonadal suppression. Prolactin exerts its inhibitory tone on kisspeptin neurons, which are the key regulators of pulsatile GnRH neuronal secretion. This is evidenced by the restoration of gonadal function with kisspeptin supplementation in patients with hyperprolactinemia induced hypogonadism. In women, hypogonadism is associated with sexual dysfunction, fatigue, sleep and mood disturbances with corresponding reductions in QOL. In men, the negative effects of hypogonadism on vitality, body composition, mood, cognitive function and sexual health lead to similarly reduced QOL.

Hyperprolactinemia may affect QOL independent of its effects on gonadal hormones. Hyperprolactinaemia is associated with anxiety, somatization, hostility and depression. This may be augmented by the emotional impact of their diagnosis and variable adoption of the sick role. The mechanisms of direct effects of prolactin on the brain and behaviour are unclear. Prolactin influences hypothalamic appetite regulation by inducing leptin resistance, inducing hyperphagia and weight gain. Hypogonadism, particularly androgen deficiency, may further contribute to the development of the metabolic syndrome in hyperprolactinemia. It also acts peripherally, inducing insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia. Dissatisfaction with body composition and appearance may affect mood and QOL. Hyperprolactinemia also has direct effects on bone metabolism, increasing resorption and inhibiting new bone formation, predisposing to fractures, which may affect physical functioning, pain, and QOL.

Headache has a significant impact on QOL in patients with pituitary adenoma, and prolactinoma may be particularly cephalalgogenic. Headaches occur in both micro- and macro-prolactinomas, may be induced by TRH (a potent prolactin secretagogue), and improve with DA therapy, implicating prolactin in headache pathogenesis.

### Endocan levels in patients with hyperprolactinemia [^114SpX4b]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction and objective

Hyperprolactinemia may result from physiological, pharmacological, or pathological causes and can lead to clinical manifestations such as hypogonadism, oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and infertility.

Beyond these clinical effects, hyperprolactinemia is also considered a risk factor for cardiovascular events. Elevated prolactin levels are associated with reduced nitric oxide production and direct vasoconstriction, contributing to increased blood pressure and endothelial proliferation. It is well established that endothelial cell proliferation triggers angiogenesis. Increased carotid intima-media thickness has also been reported in patients with prolactinoma. Due to the effects of prolactin on adipose tissue, elevated levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B may be observed. These mechanisms may collectively contribute to the heightened cardiovascular risk associated with hyperprolactinemia.

The endocan molecule is a free, soluble dermatan sulfate proteoglycan secreted by vascular endothelium, which can also be observed in the bloodstream of the healthy population. Due to these properties, it has been shown to increase in vascular pathologies and inflammatory diseases. It has been shown that Endocan levels increase due to endothelial damage in cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease, acute myocardial infarction, and hypertension, and it is considered to potentially be accepted as a biomarker for cardiovascular events.

Although there are many studies correlating high prolactin with cardiovascular risk, to our knowledge, there is no study directly examining prolactin levels and Endocan levels. The aim of our study is to compare Endocan levels in patients with hyperprolactinemia to the control group and to reveal the potential role of Endocan levels in the cardiovascular risk associated with elevated prolactin levels.

Carcinogenesis

Carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice and rats with cabergoline given by gavage at doses up to 0.98 mg/kg/day and 0.32 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are 7 times and 4 times the maximum recommended human dose calculated on a body surface area basis using total mg/m2/week in rodents and mg/m2/week for a 50 kg human.

There was a slight increase in the incidence of cervical and uterine leiomyomas and uterine leiomyosarcomas in mice. In rats, there was a slight increase in malignant tumors of the cervix and uterus and interstitial cell adenomas. The occurrence of tumors in female rodents may be related to the prolonged suppression of prolactin secretion because prolactin is needed in rodents for the maintenance of the corpus luteum. In the absence of prolactin, the estrogen/progesterone ratio is increased, thereby increasing the risk for uterine tumors. In male rodents, the decrease in serum prolactin levels was associated with an increase in serum luteinizing hormone, which is thought to be a compensatory effect to maintain testicular steroid synthesis. Since these hormonal mechanisms are thought to be species-specific, the relevance of these tumors to humans is not known.

Mutagenesis

The mutagenic potential of cabergoline was evaluated and found to be negative in a battery of in vitro tests. These tests included the bacterial mutation (Ames) test with Salmonella typhimurium, the gene mutation assay with Schizosaccharomyces pombe P 1and V79 Chinese hamster cells, DNA damage and repair in Saccharomyces cerevisiae D 4, and chromosomal aberrations in human lymphocytes. Cabergoline was also negative in the bone marrow micronucleus test in the mouse.

Impairment of Fertility

In female rats, a daily cabergoline dose of 0.003 mg/kg for 2 weeks prior to mating and throughout the mating period inhibited conception. This dose represents approximately 0.04 times the maximum recommended human dose calculated on a body surface area basis using total mg/m2/week in rats and mg/m2/week for a 50 kg human. This finding is likely due to the role of prolactin in implantation in rats and is not thought to be relevant to humans.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyperprolactinemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116BaVzk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Hyperprolactinemia — diagnosis: To establish the diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia, we recommend a single measurement of serum prolactin, and a level above the upper limit of normal confirms the diagnosis as long as the serum sample was obtained without excessive venipuncture stress; we recommend against dynamic testing of prolactin secretion for the diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia.

### Serum prolactin concentrations as risk factor of metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes? [^115UTGXW]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

However, given the inherent limitations of observational research, the definite role of serum PRL concentrations as a risk factor or risk marker can not be elucidated based on epidemiological data alone. Previous associations between serum PRL concentrations and disease risk observed in clinical study samples, but not in the general population, suggest PRL rather as specific disease marker than as causal risk factor for MetS and T2DM. Thus, its application and significance in daily clinical practice is very limited to date.

### The prolactin gene: a paradigm of tissue-specific gene regulation with complex temporal transcription dynamics [^112Ri2Ye]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

The temporal dynamics of biological systems is a key component of tissue or organism function. In endocrine tissues, frequency encoding of information via pulsatile hormone secretion has long been appreciated to be important in the regulation of target systems. More recently, numerous genes have been shown to be transcribed in a temporal manner, resulting in stochastic pulses or bursts of transcription, including hormone-encoding genes. In single cell organisms, pulsatile gene expression has been hypothesised to increase the overall fitness of the population to changing environmental conditions. In multicellular organisms, the physiological relevance of pulsatile transcription is less clear, although links to cell lineage decisions have been made. More generally, pulsatile transcription may influence whole tissue responses by limiting the number of cells able to mount a transcriptional response at any given time. Overall pulsatile transcription may reflect the summation of a number of temporal processes occurring in the nucleus, including: on/off transcription factor dynamics, transcription complex assembly, polymerase recruitment and activation, chromatin remodelling cycles, and recruitment of DNA to transcriptionally competent areas of the nucleus (transcription factories). In this review, we describe the transcription dynamics of the prolactin gene, which is used as a model of tissue-specific gene regulation, in the context of established mechanisms of prolactin gene regulation.

Prolactin is an important endocrine hormone, which is secreted primarily from lactotroph cells of the pituitary gland in a circadian manner, with increases in secretion occurring during the pro-oestrous phase of the rat 4-day oestrous cycle, as well as during pregnancy and stress. Prolactin in humans can also be generated locally in numerous tissues and cells, including the endometrium, brain, breast, skin, lymphocytes and adipocytes. Unsurprisingly, therefore, prolactin has been shown to function in numerous processes, including reproduction, metabolism, immunology and behaviour, as well as pathologically in cancer. The diverse expression of the human prolactin gene requires complex regulation, with the use of two independent promoters, which show differential responses to regulatory mediators and cell-type specific activity. This organisation of the human prolactin locus is not conserved across mammalian species and is markedly different from the rat and mouse prolactin loci, which have been used as experimental models of prolactin regulation for decades as a result of sequence conservation of important regulatory elements located proximally to the gene (Fig. 1).

### Immune dysregulation as a key driver of peripartum cardiomyopathy-an exploratory advanced imaging and biomarker study [^115RkHaa]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a pregnancy‐associated form of heart failure (HF) with acute onset affecting women without known cardiomyopathies or other forms of cardiovascular disease. PPCM is linked to significant premature mortality, arrhythmias, and can result in irreversible cardiac remodelling in a substantial proportion of patients. It occurs globally, however, with marked regional differences in epidemiology and outcomes. Extensive research elucidated elements of the pathophysiology of PPCM in murine models and humans. Contemporary hypotheses suggest a multi‐hit model for the development of PPCM, whereby susceptible women (i.e. those with genetic predisposition, at extremes of age, with multiple pregnancies and/or nutritional deficiencies) experience unbalanced oxidative stress that promotes an angiogenic and metabolic imbalance and subsequently leads to HF in the peripartum period. Among those, prolactin plays the most important role, as oxidative stress triggers cathepsin D to cleave the full‐length nursing hormone prolactin into an anti‐angiogenic 16‐kDa fragment. The understanding of the role of prolactin led to the utilization of disease‐specific therapeutic prolactin blockers, bromocriptine/cabergoline, which improve outcomes. Aside from bromocriptine, anti‐inflammatory therapies have been beneficial in an African PPCM population.

However, the causes of oxidative stress and the ensuing inflammatory processes remain poorly delineated. The aim of this study was to explore the inflammatory processes directly activated in the acute phase of a de novo HF such as PPCM using whole‐body and cardiac 18 F‐fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography‐computed tomography (18 FDG‐PET‐CT), cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), and serum inflammatory proteomic profiling and to delineate whether the inflammatory processes are limited to the heart, or also involve extra‐cardiac or systemic inflammation.

### Prolactin in men's health and disease [^1127PHC3]. Current Opinion in Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review physiology of prolactin (PRL), cause and managment of hyperprolactinemia, and discuss evolving diverse roles of PRL in men's health.

Recent Findings

Hyperprolactinemia can be physiologically found after sexual activities, exercise, lactation, during pregnancy, and after stressful venipuncture. Elevated PRL can be caused by medications use, renal failure, hypothyroidism, and by prolactinoma - PRL secreting tumors. Symptomatic hyperprolactinemia and prolactinomas should be treated to lower PRL levels, decrease tumor size, and restore gonadal function. Three modes of treatment are typically utilized: pharmacological, radiosurgery with gamma radiation, and external beam radiation. Pharmacological treatment of prolactinomas is mainly based on dopamine agonists. The most frequently used dopamine agonists are bromocriptine and cabergoline. Cabergoline becoming the preferred drug in the treatment of prolactinomas because of higher response rate and less side-effects. Bromocriptine has been recently approved to improve glycemic control in diabetes mellitus.

Summary

PRL plays a diverse role in men's reproduction and health. Detecting and treating elevated PRL may not only improve infertility and hypogonadism but also have a positive effect on the metabolic profile of patient and control of glycemic control and metabolic profile - an important advantage considering dramatic and worldwide increase in obesity and diabetes.

### Prolactin and human tumourogenesis [^113NpE9D]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

The involvement of prolactin in human tumourogenesis has been long debated. The reason is that the evidence supporting the role of circulating prolactin in promoting breast cancer was mainly obtained using rodent models, whereas most of the studies performed in human species in the 1980s have remained inconclusive. Things have now started to change because two alternative mechanisms of prolactin actions in tumour growth have emerged since the beginning of the 21st Century. The first involves locally-produced prolactin, which acts by an autocrine/paracrine mechanism. Genetically-modified mouse models have demonstrated the tumourigenic potential of local prolactin on the prostate and the mammary gland, and arguments are now emerging in humans also. The second mechanism involves genetic variants of the receptor. Although no genetic disorder has been reported for prolactin or its receptor, a variant of the prolactin receptor exhibiting constitutive activity has been recently identified in patients presenting with breast tumours, suggesting that sustained prolactin signalling may participate in breast tumourogenesis. Recent data regarding these two nonclassical mechanisms of prolactin action are discussed. Finally, we address the question of their inhibition in future cancer therapy, both in light of other findings that have revealed novel actions of prolactin in breast cancer cells, and with respect to the compounds currently available to target prolactin receptor signalling.

### Comparison of urinary prolactin and serum / urine prolactin ratio in hyperprolactinemic and macroprolactinemic patients [^11233yxN]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Prolactin is secreted from pituitary lactotroph cells. There are three forms of prolactin in blood circulation: monomer prolactin, prolactin dimer, or big prolactin, and macroprolactin, another form of big prolactin, that binds to immunoglobulins. The biological functions of monomeric form of this hormone, including its roles in reproduction, metabolism, immunity, and lactation, are essential and specific Prolactin levels increase in various physiological conditions such as pregnancy, stress, and exercise, as well as in pathological conditions including pituitary and hypothalamic tumors, systemic diseases like kidney failure, polycystic ovary syndrome, and cirrhosis. Prolactin levels also rise in response to certain medications, such as neuroleptic drugs. Measuring it to diagnose and treat diseases such as pituitary tumors, such as prolactinoma, reproductive problems, and amenorrhea is essential. In modern prolactin measurement methods, all forms of prolactin are included in the measurement. The presence of macroprolactin, which is biologically inactive and unrelated to the patient's symptoms, can cause a false increase in prolactin levels, leading to the misdiagnosis of hyperprolactinemia and inappropriate treatments. Therefore, all cases of hyperprolactinemia should be evaluated for the presence of macroprolactin to reduce the unnecessary use of imaging, avoid inappropriate dopamine agonist treatments, and save time and money.

### The effects of different physiologic concentrations of prolactin in association with reproductive hormones on the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in men: tehran lipid and glucose study [^111DMbSk]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Prolactin (PRL) is a polypeptide pituitary hormone primarily known for its lactogenic role in mammals. PRL receptors are expressed in multiple organs and are involved in many physiologic functions, including osmoregulation, immune response, growth and development, brain function, reproduction, and metabolism. According to preclinical studies, it is evident that serum PRL concentrations within the physiologic range contribute to maintaining normal glucose homeostasis in both sexes. To elucidate, PRL enhances the proliferation of pancreatic beta cells, increases glucose-dependent insulin secretion, and prevents pancreatic islet apoptosis. As a result, serum PRL concentrations within the physiologic range might reduce the risk of developing type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM). In this context, it has been shown that higher than-normal serum concentrations of PRL (hyperprolactinemia) lead to insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. In addition, the symptomatic state of excess PRL that could be developed via hypothalamic-pituitary axis disorders or drugs -referred to as pathologic hyperprolactinemia- increases post-prandial insulin resistance. This process leads to increased gluconeogenesis together with lipolysis and impairment of peripheral glucose uptake. Furthermore, hyperprolactinemia results in abnormal fatty acid metabolism and an aggravated inflammatory state, leading to increased food intake, weight gain, and insulin resistance. Therefore, hyperprolactinemia (pathologic or not) might increase the risk of type 2 DM. As a result, PRL has contradictory effects on metabolism; while its concentrations within the physiologic range seem metabolically beneficial, its pathological concentrations have a detrimental effect on metabolism.

Hyperprolactinemia — initial evaluation and causes: In patients with asymptomatic hyperprolactinemia, we suggest assessing for macroprolactin. When prolactin is only mildly elevated despite a very large pituitary tumor, we recommend serial dilution of serum samples to address a possible "hook effect". For symptomatic nonphysiological hyperprolactinemia, we recommend excluding medication use, renal failure, hypothyroidism, and pituitary and parasellar tumors.

### Diagnosis and management of prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas: a pituitary society international consensus statement [^112Hv6QD]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

This Consensus Statement from an international, multidisciplinary workshop sponsored by the Pituitary Society offers evidence-based graded consensus recommendations and key summary points for clinical practice on the diagnosis and management of prolactinomas. Epidemiology and pathogenesis, clinical presentation of disordered pituitary hormone secretion, assessment of hyperprolactinaemia and biochemical evaluation, optimal use of imaging strategies and disease-related complications are addressed. In-depth discussions present the latest evidence on treatment of prolactinoma, including efficacy, adverse effects and options for withdrawal of dopamine agonist therapy, as well as indications for surgery, preoperative medical therapy and radiation therapy. Management of prolactinoma in special situations is discussed, including cystic lesions, mixed growth hormone-secreting and prolactin-secreting adenomas and giant and aggressive prolactinomas. Furthermore, considerations for pregnancy and fertility are outlined, as well as management of prolactinomas in children and adolescents, patients with an underlying psychiatric disorder, postmenopausal women, transgender individuals and patients with chronic kidney disease. The workshop concluded that, although treatment resistance is rare, there is a need for additional therapeutic options to address clinical challenges in treating these patients and a need to facilitate international registries to enable risk stratification and optimization of therapeutic strategies.

Arch Intern Med. 1979; 139: 1415–1419. doi: 10.1001/archinte.1979.03630490063019 Since the radioimmunoassay for serum prolactin became available eight years ago, prolactin has become a hormone of considerable clinical interest. An elevated serum prolactin concentration is the most frequent hormone marker for pituitary tumors. Secreted in excess, prolactin causes dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, the gonads, and the adrenal cortex. In women, menstrual disturbances, galactorrhea, infertility, and hirsutism result. Impotence, oligospermia, and decreased libido are common in men. These metabolic abnormalities attributed to prolactin excess are corrected when prolactin concentrations are lowered by either medical or surgical therapy. The availability of effective therapy mandates early recognition and proper management of the patient with hyperprolactinemia.

### Blunted prolactin response… [^117S9ETD]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Prolactin concentrations of 30 unmedicated psychiatric inpatients and 11 normal controls were measured at baseline and at 30 and 60 minutes after the administration of 10 mg of intramuscular methadone hydrochloride. Methadone raised the prolactin level at 60 minutes to more than twice the mean baseline level for the full subject sample. Patients with depressive disorders had lower mean basal prolactin levels than did the other subjects, and also manifested attenuated prolactin responses to methadone. Eight of 16 depressives had markedly blunted prolactin responses, a finding consistent with other studies reporting deficient responses in depression. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the pathophysiology of depressive disorders involves dysfunctions in the anterior pituitary itself or in the hypothalamic neurotransmitter and neuromodulator systems that regulate the secretion of prolactin and other neurohormones.

### Antipsychotics and hyperprolactinaemia: clinical recommendations [^117JamwL]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2008). Low credibility.

A group of international experts in psychiatry, medicine, toxicology and pharmacy assembled to undertake a critical examination of the currently available clinical guidance on hyperprolactinaemia. This paper summarises the group's collective views and provides a summary of the recommendations agreed by the consensus group to assist clinicians in the recognition, clinical assessment, investigation and management of elevated plasma prolactin levels in patients being treated for severe mental illness. It also deals with the special problems of particular populations, gives advice about information that should be provided to patients, and suggests a strategy for routine monitoring of prolactin. The recommendations are based upon the evidence contained in the supplement 'Hyperprolactinaemia in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder: Clinical Implications' (2008). The guidance contained in this article is not intended to replace national guidance (such as that of the National Institute of Clinical Excellence), however, it does provide additional detail that is unlikely to be covered in existing guidelines, and focuses on areas of uncertainty and disagreement. We hope it will add to the debate about this topic.

### Hyperprolactinemia and prolactinomas [^112htS1h]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Any process interfering with dopamine synthesis, its transport to the pituitary gland, or its action at the level of lactotroph dopamine receptors can cause hyperprolactinemia. As described in this article, considering the complexity of prolactin regulation, many factors could cause hyperprolactinemia, and hyperprolactinemia can have clinical effects not only on the reproductive axis. Once any drug effects are excluded, prolactinomas are the most common cause of hyperprolactinemia. The most frequent symptom is hypogonadism in both genders. Medical and surgical therapies generally have excellent results, and most prolactinomas are well controlled or even cured in some cases.

### The risk for breast cancer is not evidently increased in women with hyperprolactinemia [^1117iERH]. Pituitary (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hyperprolactinemia that causes complaints and leads to treatment is caused by a prolactinoma in the majority of cases. In the absence of visualization of an adenoma on MRI, and of secondary causes such as medication, the hyperprolactinemia is referred to as idiopathic. Low dose of a dopamine agonist is the treatment of choice in patients with a prolactinoma or with complaints caused by hyperprolactinemia. Dopamine agonists normalize prolactin levels and decrease tumor size in the majority of cases. However, due to a delay in diagnosis, these patients often have been exposed to increased levels of prolactin for months to years.

Prolactin has proliferative effects on mammary epithelial cells. Moreover, hyperprolactinemia is associated with oncogenesis of the mammary glands in rodents. However, the issue is still unresolved, whether hyperprolactinemia is associated with an excess risk for breast cancer in female subjects. Nonetheless, case reports have suggested an association between prolactinomas and breast cancer. In follow-up studies higher prolactin levels have been associated with an increased risk for breast cancer. Unfortunately, studies on prolactinoma patients are often underpowered to assess the risk for breast cancer properly. Therefore, the aim of the present analysis was to assess the risk of breast cancer in a previously defined large cohort of patients treated for idiopathic hyperprolactinemia or prolactinomas.

### Serum prolactin concentrations as risk factor of metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes? [^115amP9z]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, this is the first population-based study to show low PRL concentrations related to a higher T2DM risk in both genders. But given the variable associations between PRL and T2DM, but not with MetS, together with the absent longitudinal associations with both outcomes, the present study does not support PRL as a causal cardiometabolic risk factor. Therefore, we hypothesize PRL rather as a marker of the complex multi-level alterations involved in the onset and progression of T2DM. However, to further elucidate the potential role of PRL in the context of this complex interplay, further observational as well as interventional research is needed.

### The prolactin gene: a paradigm of tissue-specific gene regulation with complex temporal transcription dynamics [^11441XLy]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2012). Low credibility.

Nucleosome positioning may also be affected by Z-DNA. Z-DNA formation is favoured by alternating purine–pyrimidine sequence repeats, generating a nonclassical DNA structure with a left-handed helix. The biological role of Z-DNA has not been fully elucidated, although it may have roles in transcription initiation and chromatin remodelling. There is evidence that Z-DNA may prevent nucleosome binding to DNA following nucleosome eviction by chromatin remodelling enzymes, facilitating the interaction of the transcription machinery with promoter sequences. In the rat prolactin locus, Z-DNA has been detected flanking the distal enhancer, with the downstream Z-DNA sequence having a negative influence on prolactin expression. In the human prolactin locus, the Z-DNA sequences have been reduced to a single shorter sequence downstream of the distal enhancer. Interestingly, an extensive Z-DNA repeat is located in intron 4–5 of the human and rat prolactin loci, although the functional role of this is unknown.

### Prolactin's paradox: friend, foe, or both in immune regulation? [^112fu9rL]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Over 100 diseases have been recognized as autoimmune in nature, collectively affecting ∼20% of the population in industrialized countries. These conditions are more prevalent among women of childbearing age, reflecting the potential association between alterations in the immune-neuroendocrine network, on the one hand, and autoimmune conditions, on the other. Prolactin (PRL), a polypeptide hormone that is primarily (but not only) secreted by the lactotrophic cells of the pituitary gland, is a critical element of the immune-neuroendocrine network. Although this hormone has several nonimmune functions, its role in regulating immune responses and affecting autoimmune inflammation is particularly enigmatic and controversial. Indeed, PRL interacts with various immune cells to bolster the body defenses, but also potentially to exacerbate autoimmune conditions. Understanding how and when PRL acts as a 'friend or foe' is crucial for unraveling its role as a potential therapeutic target in the management of autoimmune diseases (AIDs). This review therefore provides a critical overview of PRL's role in the immune system, and of the influence of this pleiotropic hormone in the development of autoimmunity.

### Sleep disorders impact hormonal regulation: unravelling the relationship among sleep disorders, hormones and metabolic diseases [^115mthPK]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Testosterone

TT, secreted by Leydig cells in the interstitial tissue of the testes, is the most important sex hormone in males. The majority of TT is bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) or albumin, with only a small fraction existing in the circulation as free TT. Plasma TT levels exhibit a pronounced circadian rhythm, characterized by increasing levels with prolonged sleep duration, achieving peak levels in the early morning hours. Luboshitzky et al. reported that the nocturnal rhythm of TT is associated with REM sleep, with young men reaching peak levels during the first REM sleep episode and maintaining this level until awakening. Thus, disruption in sleep structure, especially a decrease in the frequency or efficiency of REM sleep, directly affects TT hormone levels. In turn, low TT levels inversely impact sleep quality, leading to increased episodes of awakenings and decreased durations of SWS.

Prolactin

Prolactin (PRL) is a peptide hormone primarily synthesized and secreted by the pituitary gland, and it is inhibited by dopamine (DA) from the hypothalamus. PRL receptors are widely distributed throughout the body, including the pancreas, liver, small intestine, and adipose tissue. In addition to regulating lactation, PRL also regulates reproduction, growth, development, energy metabolism, immunity, angiogenesis, and other functions. Studies have demonstrated that PRL is regulated mainly by the sleep-wake cycle, and the plasma concentration of PRL exhibits a sleep-dependent pattern, with higher levels during sleep and lower levels during wake. Therefore, lack of sleep causes the levels of PRL to decrease.

### Current evaluation of amenorrhea: a committee opinion [^115qEEwo]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Hyperprolactinemia evaluation — hyperprolactinemia may be associated with decreased E2 concentrations and amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, yet only approximately 1/3 of women with hyperprolactinemia will have galactorrhea; prolactin concentrations are higher in women with amenorrhea than in those with oligomenorrhea, and prolactin levels < 15–20 ng/mL in most clinical laboratories will exclude hyperprolactinemia, whereas mildly elevated values (20–40 ng/mL) should be repeated and confirmed, and if they remain mildly elevated (and the patient is otherwise asymptomatic), a macroprolactin level should be considered; macroprolactin has been reported to have a prevalence as high as nearly 20% of patients diagnosed with hyperprolactinemia, is biologically inactive compared with the predominant circulating form of prolactin (80%–95%) called monomeric prolactin, and macroprolactinemia is confirmed by having the laboratory pretreat the patient's serum with polyethylene glycol to precipitate macroprolactin; establishing this diagnosis avoids unnecessary and costly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging.

### Prolactin deficiency is independently associated with reduced insulin-like growth factor I status in severely growth hormone-deficient adults [^1125UM8B]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Background

In adult life, considerable overlap in IGF-I status exists between normal and severely GH-deficient (GHD) subjects defined by conventional dynamic testing of GH secretion. IGF-I is not therefore widely viewed as a reliable diagnostic marker for GHD. Recognized factors influencing serum IGF-I level in GHD include age, gender, timing of onset of GHD, and exogenous estrogen therapy, but these do not fully explain GH/IGF-I discordance in severe GHD. The primary structures of prolactin and GH are closely related. Effects of hypoprolactinemia are not well described in humans, but laboratory studies suggest a role for prolactin in hepatic IGF-I release, possibly through a signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) pathway. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a potential contribution of prolactin to IGF-I status in severely GHD adults.

Patients and Methods

Using multiple regression analysis techniques, contributions of the following variables to age-adjusted IGF-I sd scores were evaluated in 162 (85 female) GHD adults: gender, timing of onset of GHD, presence or absence of prolactin deficiency, body mass index, number of additional pituitary deficits, and underlying pathology.

Results

Childhood onset GHD (P < 0.0001) and presence of prolactin deficiency (P < 0.0001) were independently associated with reduced IGF-I status. The contributions of these parameters to IGF-I sd scores were -2.55 and -2.67, respectively. Gender (P = 0.06), body mass index (P = 0.99), number of additional pituitary deficits (P = 0.64), and underlying pathology (P = 0.06) did not significantly influence IGF-I status.

Conclusions

Prolactin deficiency is independently associated with reduced IGF-I status in hypopituitary adults. It is possible that prolactin deficiency is a surrogate for the degree of severity of GHD, implying a GHD paradigm undetected by conventional GH provocative tests; alternatively, it remains plausible that circulating prolactin contributes to IGF-I release in the absence of GH, possibly through a signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) pathway.

### Phase difference between serum prolactin and cortisol rhythms is related to body mass index in humans [^112aWEcQ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Prolactin (PRL) has many effects in animals and man. For example, it regulates fat mass in fish, birds, and mammals. In particular, the timing of the serum PRL acrophase in relation to the light-dark cycle or to serum cortisol in constant light conditions determines whether the fat mass increases or decreases, as part of the adaptation to seasons. The role of PRL in this respect has been less well studied in man.

Hypothesis

We hypothesized that the timing of the PRL acrophase (time point of peak amplitude of the rhythm) with respect to that of cortisol may be correlated with fat mass [or body mass index (BMI) as proxy] in the human, as observed in animals.

Subjects

Seventy-four subjects were available [mean age, 43 (22–77) yr; mean BMI, 26.8 (18.7–38.4) kg/m(2)].

Measures

Immunofluorometric PRL assay and cortisol RIA of 10-min blood samples collected for 24 h were followed by cosinor analysis for the estimation of the acrophase.

Results

The time difference between the cortisol and PRL acrophases was positively correlated with BMI (P = 0.002), but not with sex, age, or season.

Conclusion

In various species, a wide gap between the serum cortisol acrophase and that of PRL leads to fat storage. Our finding is consistent with this observation, although we used BMI as proxy. If an advance shift of the PRL acrophase in relation to that of cortisol is indeed responsible for increased fat mass in man, manipulating the PRL phase may offer an alternative means to treat obesity.

### Technology insight: measuring prolactin in clinical samples [^114LdS4i]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2007). Medium credibility.

Measurement of prolactin is one of the most commonly undertaken hormonal investigations in evaluating patients with reproductive disorders. Hyperprolactinemia is found in up to 17% of such cases. Diagnostic evaluation of hyperprolactinemia is difficult but is facilitated by a logical approach where a thorough patient history is obtained, secondary causes of hyperprolactinemia are excluded, and the limitations of current prolactin assays are appreciated. Once hyperprolactinemia has been confirmed, attempts to establish the underlying cause can start. Given current workloads, laboratories rely on automated platforms to measure prolactin, most of which employ two-site immunoassay sandwich methods. Although generally robust and reliable, such immunoassays are susceptible to interference, and good collaboration between clinicians and the laboratory helps to minimize problems. A major challenge facing laboratories is correct differentiation of patients with true hyperprolactinemia from those with macroprolactinemia. Macroprolactin is a high-molecular-mass, biologically inactive form of prolactin that is detected to varying degrees by all prolactin immunoassays. Conservative estimates suggest that the presence of macroprolactin leads to misdiagnosis in as many as 10% of all reported instances of biochemical hyperprolactinemia. In the absence of specific testing, macroprolactin represents a diagnostic pitfall that results in the misdiagnosis and mismanagement of large numbers of patients.

### Elevated prolactin secretion during proestrus in mice: absence of a defined surge [^111rCgUN]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

In male and nonpregnant female rodents, circulating levels of the anterior pituitary gland hormone, prolactin, are generally low. This is achieved by a tonic inhibitory input from the hypothalamus sustained by a "short‐loop" negative feedback mechanism. Prolactin regulates its own secretion through action on neuroendocrine dopamine (NEDA) neurons located in the periventricular and arcuate nuclei of the hypothalamus. Prolactin action increases firing rates of these neurons, causing dopamine release. Dopamine then travels via the pituitary portal blood vessels to act on dopamine D2 receptors on lactotrophs leading to tonic inhibition of prolactin release from these cells. In the face of this inhibitory hypothalamic tone, enhanced prolactin secretion may be achieved either through mechanisms that reduce dopamine output from the NEDA neurons, or factors that directly stimulate prolactin release (prolactin‐releasing factors, PRFs).

### Evaluation and treatment of galactorrhea… [^112JXGC2]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Normal Lactation and Prolactin Before lactation, the female breast is primed by estrogen, progesterone, growth hormone, insulin, thyroid hormone and glucocorticoids. These hormones aid in the growth of the ductal system and lobules, and in the development of secretory characteristics of the alveoli. Ironically, high levels of estrogen and progesterone also inhibit lactation at receptor sites in the breast tissue. The precipitous drop in the levels of these hormones after delivery, in the presence of an elevated prolactin level, facilitates lactation. Prolactin is normally secreted by the anterior pituitary gland at a low basal rate, with secretion continuously suppressed by prolactin inhibiting factor. 2–4 Dopamine, released from the hypothalamus and delivered via the hypothalamic-hypophysial portal system, is the main constituent of prolactin inhibiting factor.

Prolactin acts at the breast to promote milk secretion and at the ovaries to regulate the release of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone. Prolactin levels cycle and are highest during sleep. Levels in normal nonpregnant women range from 1 to 20 ng per mL, depending on the laboratory, and may increase to as high as 300 ng per mL during pregnancy. Pituitary prolactinomas are associated with elevated prolactin levels. Clinical signs and symptoms include headache, galactorrhea, amenorrhea, defects in peripheral vision, hirsutism, acne, and hypogonadism presenting as decreased libido, decreased fertility or decreased bone density. The prognosis for patients with these tumors is excellent. Most pituitary prolactinomas regress or remain stable for many years. Nonpituitary malignancies, such as bronchogenic carcinoma, renal adenocarcinoma and Hodgkin's and T-cell lymphomas, may also release prolactin.

Evaluation The evaluation of galactorrhea includes a thorough history and physical examination. Selected laboratory tests and imaging studies are also important. The prolactin level should be measured every three to six months, and imaging studies should be performed every two to three years. Medical treatments for prolactinomas include bromocriptine and cabergoline. These agents activate the lactotroph D.

### Serum prolactin concentrations as risk factor of metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes? [^113bq6ii]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Prolactin (PRL) is a pituitary hormone essential for various physiological functions in the human body. It is not only important for the initiation and maintenance of lactation, but seems to be also involved in reproduction, growth and development, osmoregulation, immune regulation, brain function, behaviour, and metabolism. These different functions of PRL can only be fulfilled due to the fact that the PRL receptor is expressed in different tissues and cells such as lymphoid cells, endometrium, prostate, and adipocytes.

The metabolic syndrome (MetS), a cluster of cardiometabolic risk factors including obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, and insulin resistance, is often associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Although previous investigations about the potential effects of PRL in T2DM and its complications are scarce, existing experimental studies suggest an influence of PRL on T2DM via its metabolic effects on adipose tissue, development and growth of pancreatic ß-cells, insulin resistance, and lipid metabolism. The ability of PRL to stimulate insulin and suppress adiponectin as well as interleukin-6 release further suggests a potential role in the manifestation of insulin resistance. But although these studies support the view that PRL promotes the growth and survival of pancreatic ß-cells and supports insulin secretion, other studies were not able to detect any correlation between PRL and metabolic disturbances.

An observational study among erectile dysfunction patients showed an association between low PRL concentrations and adverse cardiovascular risk profiles and events. However, in most of these previous studies the correlation between PRL and cardiometabolic risk factors including MetS or T2DM were not the main focus. Furthermore, previous studies were conducted in comparably small and selected patient populations without consideration of major confounding factors. Therefore, we aimed to investigate potential associations of PRL with MetS and T2DM using a large, representative sample of 3,993 individuals from the population-based longitudinal cohort Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP).

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyperprolactinemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112RNDFn]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim was to formulate practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of hyperprolactinemia.

Participants

The Task Force consisted of Endocrine Society-appointed experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer.

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to describe both the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence.

Consensus Process

One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications enabled consensus. Committees and members of The Endocrine Society, The European Society of Endocrinology, and The Pituitary Society reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of these guidelines.

Conclusions

Practice guidelines are presented for diagnosis and treatment of patients with elevated prolactin levels. These include evidence-based approaches to assessing the cause of hyperprolactinemia, treating drug-induced hyperprolactinemia, and managing prolactinomas in nonpregnant and pregnant subjects. Indications and side effects of therapeutic agents for treating prolactinomas are also presented.

### Hyperprolactinemia as a manifestation of multiple sclerosis attack [^1168cKw6]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Prolactin is a hormone responsible for lactation and other actions needed to maintain homeostasis. The anterior pituitary synthesises and secretes prolactin, which is regulated by dopamine-mediated hypothalamic control. However, the central nervous system, immune system, uterus and mammary glands are also capable of producing prolactin. Inappropriately elevated levels can lead to galactorrhea in non-breastfeeding females or males, which can be caused by different diseases and requires different treatments.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disorder involving the central nervous system. Some of the symptoms of MS include loss of balance, numbness, double vision, muscle spasms, depression and, rarely, galactorrhea. The prevalence of hyperprolactinemia in patients with MS is 6.7%. Serum prolactin levels are elevated in relapsing-remitting patients with MS during the course of the illness, with half of them showing a rise in the acute stage of relapse and a decrease during the recovery and remission phases. The reason behind high prolactin levels in these patients is unclear; however, observations suggest it may be part of hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis dysregulation due to neurodegeneration or demyelination. It is not recommended to treat galactorrhea in patients with MS with dopaminergic drugs; by treating the acute relapse of MS, hyperprolactinemia and galactorrhea are typically resolved.

In this case report, we present a 31-year-old woman with left-sided paresthesia, urinary retention and bilateral galactorrhea due to a new relapse of MS. Hyperprolactinemia and galactorrhea were resolved with intravenous methylprednisolone.

### Chemiluminescence systems; do all lead to same results in prolactin analysis? [^113Fj8qL]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Human prolactin (PRL) is a hormone that is mainly secreted by lactotroph cells of the anterior pituitary gland and is involved in many biological processes including lactation and reproduction. Prolactin level may be determined quantitatively in serum by many different systems including chemiluminescence systems. However, comparison of the measured values between systems is difficult.

Methods

The prolactin values obtained and compared in two chemiluminescence systems; AUTOBIO DIAGNOSTICS MICROPLATE LUMOMETER and LIAISON XL Analyzer using BioRad tri level serum quality control materials and serum samples from n = 44 female patients; (Age mean & range) = (33: 21–65) years.

Results

Obtained PRL mean and range in Autobio and Liason systems were X = 414.8 ± 230.0; Range: 25.7–980.9 μlU/mL & X = 391.7 ± 225.6; Range: 26.0–991.4 μlU/mL respectively. Both system's results were correlated (Pearson product moment correlation r = 0.97 at p = 0.01 and Regression Analysis).

Conclusion

Because of the differences between CLIA systems the authors conclude laboratories measuring range for PRL be accomplished on particular analyzer and verified against reference intervals stated by the manufacture. More importantly, consecutive PRL level determinations and patients follow up should be performed on only one analyzer rather than different analyzers. In this regard, mentioning the method and system type on the final laboratory reports become important and verify that a laboratory considers the clinical aspects of laboratory request as well as the quality assurance in performing the PRL determination.

### A century of prolactin: emerging perspectives as a metabolic regulator [^113AmbM3]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Prolactin, a hormone that has been studied for almost a century, has evolved from a reproductive regulator to a key player in metabolic health. Initially identified for its lactogenic role, the impact of prolactin on glucose and lipid metabolism became evident in the 1970s, leading to a paradigm shift in our understanding. Deviations in prolactin levels, including hyperprolactinaemia and hypoprolactinaemia, have been associated with adverse effects on glucose and lipid metabolism. Mechanistically, prolactin regulates metabolic homoeostasis by maintaining islet abundance, regulating the hypothalamic energy regulatory centre, balancing adipose tissue expansion, and regulating hepatic metabolism. Given the widespread use of pharmaceutical agents that affect prolactin levels, it is important to examine prolactin-related metabolic effects. Recently, a profound exploration of the intricate metabolic role of prolactin has been conducted, encompassing its rhythm-dependent regulatory influence on metabolism and its correlation with cognitive impairment associated with metabolic diseases. In this review, we highlight the role of prolactin as a metabolic regulator, summarise its metabolic effects, and discuss topics related to the association between prolactin and metabolic comorbidities.

Regarding specific circumstances for hyperprolactinemia, more specifically with respect to patients with drug-induced hyperprolactinemia, ES 2011 guidelines recommend to consider offering estrogen or testosterone in patients with long-term hypogonadism (hypogonadal symptoms or low bone mass) related to drug-induced hyperprolactinemia.

### Changes in serum prolactin level during intracytoplasmic sperm injection, and effect on clinical pregnancy rate: a prospective observational study [^116w6wxT]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Prolactin (PRL) is a 198 amino acid polypeptide hormone secreted in a pulsatile manner from the anterior pituitary, and is synthesized by lactotroph cells. It weighs 23 kDa, and its secretion is affected by many factors which include stress, sleep, pregnancy, ingesting food, and chest wall stimulation (trauma, or pain). Prolactin has a primary role in the regulation of reproductive functions. While the elevation of its level beyond normal (hyperprolactinemia) can be either physiological, pathological, or idiopathic; its clinical manifestations can vary from severe to none.

Prolactin receptors have been found on endometrial cells. The secretion of endometrial prolactin helps in maintaining endometrial receptivity, and has been shown to provide an optimal environment for the implanting blastocyst transferred during in-vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles. A high enough prolactin level can inhibit the proliferation of luteinizing granulosa cells, and can also interfere with corpus luteum function resulting in luteal phase defect, as well as abnormal implantation, and embryo development. Different studies have proven the existence of a state of hyperprolactinemia during IVF/Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles.

Transient hyperprolactinemia has been proven to adversely affect the outcome of IVF, and studies have concluded that patients with normal serum prolactin levels had higher fertilization and cleavage rates. While other researchers found the effect of increased serum prolactin during IVF to be insignificant, subsequent studies found a positive effect of transient hyperprolactinemia on the outcome of ovarian simulation in IVF.

The aim of this study was to identify changes in serum prolactin levels in patients undergoing ICSI, and to evaluate the effect of these changes on the clinical pregnancy rate.

### Iloperidone [^114EhaQo]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.11 Hyperprolactinemia

As with other drugs that antagonize dopamine D2 receptors, Iloperidone elevates prolactin levels.

Hyperprolactinemia may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotropin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported with prolactin-elevating compounds. Long-standing hyperprolactinemia when associated with hypogonadism may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male patients.

Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin- dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. Mammary gland proliferative changes and increases in serum prolactin were seen in mice and rats treated with Iloperidone [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13)]. Published epidemiologic studies have shown inconsistent results when exploring the potential association between hyperprolactinemia and breast cancer.

In a short-term placebo-controlled trial (4-weeks) in patients with schizophrenia, the mean change from baseline to endpoint in plasma prolactin levels for the Iloperidone tablets 24 mg/day-treated group was an increase of 2.6 ng/mL compared to a decrease of 6.3 ng/mL in the placebo-group. In placebo-controlled trials in patients with schizophrenia, elevated plasma prolactin levels (≥ 1.15xULN) were observed in 26% of adults treated with Iloperidone compared to 12% in the placebo group. In the short-term trials, Iloperidone was associated with modest levels of prolactin elevation compared to greater prolactin elevations observed with some other antipsychotic agents. In pooled analysis from clinical studies including longer term trials, in 3210 adults treated with iloperidone, gynecomastia was reported in 2 male subjects (0.1%) compared to 0% in placebo-treated patients, and galactorrhea was reported in 8 female subjects (0.2%) compared to 3 female subjects (0.5%) in placebo- treated patients.

5.12 Body Temperature Regulation

Atypical antipsychotics may disrupt the body's ability to reduce core body temperature. Strenuous exercise, exposure to extreme heat, dehydration, and anticholinergic medications may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature; use Iloperidone with caution in patients who may experience these conditions.

### Should macroprolactin be measured in all hyperprolactinaemic sera? [^116wjimn]. Clinical Endocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

Macroprolactin is a nonbioactive prolactin isoform usually composed of a monomer of prolactin and a IgG molecule which has a prolonged clearance rate similar to that of the immunoglobulins. Macroprolactinaemia, hyperprolactinaemia entirely accounted for by the presence of macroprolactin, is estimated to account for approximately 10% of all hyperprolactinaemia coming to clinical attention in the United Kingdom and the United States. Failure to recognize that macroprolactinaemia can explain hyperprolactinaemia, leads to unnecessary investigation, incorrect diagnosis and inappropriate treatment. Screening of hyperprolactinaemic sera for the presence of misleading concentrations of macroprolactin is readily performed in biochemistry laboratories although the procedures have not been automated. The most widely employed method is to treat the hyperprolactinaemic sera with polyethylene glycol which precipitates out high-molecular weight constituents including immunoglobulins. Re-assay of the sera for prolactin will then identify those sera which yield values within the relevant normal range indicative of macroprolactinaemia and not true hyperprolactinaemia. The case for the routine screening of all hyperprolactinaemic sera for macroprolactin is compelling. The consequences of failure to recognize macroprolactinaemia are significant, the problem is frequently encountered, the means of addressing it are immediately available and it is cost effective.

### Circulating prolactin associates with diabetes and impaired glucose regulation: a population-based study [^115wMUdk]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In the current study, we found that a high circulating prolactin level was significantly associated with a lower risk of prevalent diabetes and IGR in men and postmenopausal women. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the association between circulating prolactin and glucose regulation in a large sample of community-based men and women.

The current results are in accordance with previous experimental findings. During pregnancy, levels of prolactin and prolactin receptors elevate in parallel with the increase of β-cell mass and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion to upregulate islet cell function and maintain normal glucose homeostasis. In nonpregnant models, prolactin also takes a crucial part in regulating whole-body insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism by increasing β-cell proliferation, promoting cumulative insulin secretion, inhibiting key caspases of the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways leading to islets apoptosis, and modulating immune function (,–). Interestingly, recent studies discovered that human adipose tissue produces prolactin and also expresses prolactin receptors, highlighting a previously unappreciated action of prolactin as a cytokine involved in adipose tissue function. Prolactin directly regulates adipose tissue function in downregulating lipoprotein lipase and fatty acid synthase, which consequently suppress lipogenesis, and regulates bioactivities of adipokines such as adiponectin, interleukin-6, and, possibly, leptin. Collectively, these studies raise the prospect that prolactin affects energy homeostasis through its action as an adipokine and is involved in the manifestation of insulin resistance.

In fact, the role of prolactin on glucose metabolism and insulin resistance depends on its circulating concentration. Prolactin knockout or prolactin receptor deficiency is accompanied by β-cell hypoplasia, a reduced pancreatic insulin mRNA level, a blunted insulin secretory response to glucose, and mild glucose intolerance. Physiologically elevated prolactin levels induce normal adaptive increases in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion through expanding β-cell mass and improving hepatic insulin sensitivity and have an indirect action by increasing hypothalamic dopamine synthesis to contribute to the improved energy and glucose homeostasis.

It is worth mentioning that the effect of a physiologically high prolactin level and pathological hyperprolactinemia on glucose metabolism could be different. Excessive high levels of prolactin exacerbate whole-body and hepatic insulin resistance and impair the insulin secretory capacity in diabetic mice and in patients with hyperprolactinemia caused by prolactinoma. Patients with pituitary prolactinoma often have a higher risk of hyperglycemia, accompanied by obesity and insulin resistance, and dopamine agonist treatment, such as bromocriptine, is used to reverse these symptoms.

### The role of MAPK11 / 12 / 13 / 14 (p38 MAPK) protein in dopamine agonist-resistant prolactinomas [^111jv1fz]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Prolactinomas are among the most common intracranial tumours. Prolactin secretion can lead to menstrual and lactation disorders in women and a decline in sexual function in men, and the incidence in women is significantly higher than that in men. Prolactin microadenomas with clinical symptoms generally do not develop into macroadenomas, and some prolactinomas are aggressive, with enlarged tumours and elevated blood prolactin levels. Dopamine agonists (DAs), such as bromocriptine, are first-line treatment drugs. Most prolactinoma patients show a good response to bromocriptine treatment, but 20% of patients display serious drug resistance. The patients took bromocriptine for 3 months, but their serum prolactin did not return to normal levels, and the tumour volume was reduced by less than 50%. DA resistance in prolactinoma patients is becoming increasingly serious and severely affects human reproductive health. Therefore, it is a clinical problem that urgently needs to be resolved.

### New insights in prolactin: pathological implications [^111tZecA]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2015). Medium credibility.

Prolactin is a hormone that is mainly secreted by lactotroph cells of the anterior pituitary gland, and is involved in many biological processes including lactation and reproduction. Animal models have provided insights into the biology of prolactin proteins and offer compelling evidence that the different prolactin isoforms each have independent biological functions. The major isoform, 23 kDa prolactin, acts via its membrane receptor, the prolactin receptor (PRL-R), which is a member of the haematopoietic cytokine superfamily and for which the mechanism of activation has been deciphered. The 16 kDa prolactin isoform is a cleavage product derived from native prolactin, which has received particular attention as a result of its newly described inhibitory effects on angiogenesis and tumorigenesis. The discovery of multiple extrapituitary sites of prolactin secretion also increases the range of known functions of this hormone. This Review summarizes current knowledge of the biology of prolactin and its receptor, as well as its physiological and pathological roles. We focus on the role of prolactin in human pathophysiology, particularly the discovery of the mechanism underlying infertility associated with hyperprolactinaemia and the identification of the first mutation in human PRLR.

### The effects of hyperprolactinemia on bone and fat [^113YjecU]. Pituitary (2009). Low credibility.

Many patients with prolactin secreting pituitary tumors have decreased bone mineral. The bone loss is associated with an increase in bone resorption and is secondary to prolactin-induced hypogonadism. In both sexes trabecular bone in the spine and hip is more affected than cortical bone in the distal radius. Normalization of prolactin and restoration of gonadal function increases bone density but is not associated with normalization of bone mass. It is not known whether the bone loss in hyperprolactinemic subjects represents a failure to achieve peak bone mass or is due to accelerated bone loss. Despite low bone density hyperprolactinemic subjects do not demonstrate increased fractures. The association between prolactin, weight gain and obesity suggests that prolactin may also be a modulator of body composition and body weight. It is not known whether hyperprolactinemia associated weight gain is due to stimulation of lipogenesis or due to disruption of central nervous system dopaminergic tone. Hyperprolactinemia is also associated with insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction which may improve after normalization of prolactin. The clinical significance of these findings and the precise role of prolactin in regulation of weight and metabolism remain to be elucidated.

### Prolactin acts as a potent survival factor for human breast cancer cell lines [^115xHzvg]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Human breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women from Western societies, and a large study of the epidemiology demonstrated strong associations between human prolactin and risk of breast cancer. Using established models of apoptosis of human breast cancer cell lines, we assessed the role of prolactin in breast cancer cell growth and survival. We showed that prolactin had no effect on the metabolic activity or total cell number of any cell lines. We confirmed endogenous prolactin production by these cells and that the levels varied. In the presence of a prolactin-neutralising antibody, each of the cell lines responded with the induction of apoptosis as opposed to growth inhibition. The sensitivity of the cell lines to the physiological inducer of apoptosis, C2-ceramide, appeared relative to the levels of endogenous prolactin that they contained. We then showed that exogenously added prolactin acted as a potent survival factor against apoptosis in all the cell lines examined. In addition, we demonstrated that a prolactin-neutralising antibody in combination with C2-ceramide caused an anticipated, additive increase in cell death. This study demonstrated that prolactin protects human breast cancer cell lines against apoptosis and this may have important implications for cancer treatment.

### Pituitary society guidance: pituitary disease management and patient care recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic-an international perspective [^113xkR2F]. Pituitary (2020). High credibility.

Lactotroph adenoma — diagnosis and management during COVID-19: The diagnosis of a lactotroph adenoma can be inferred from a pituitary adenoma with elevated prolactin, and pituitary imaging (MRI or CT) is a key step with evaluation for hypopituitarism also necessary. Dopamine-agonists (DA) can normalize prolactin and reduce adenoma size, and in patients with a microadenoma not seeking fertility, hormone-replacement therapy may also be appropriate if serum prolactin is routinely followed and imaging performed as necessary. Counseling on potential DA side-effects is crucial, and medical therapy can be managed effectively and efficiently via VVs coupled with laboratory/imaging studies as needed. In the small number for whom medical therapy is not possible and surveillance is not appropriate (e.g., macroprolactinoma with visual loss), the risks and benefits of surgical intervention will need to be carefully weighed.

### Current guidelines and their recommendations for prolactin monitoring in psychosis [^114VpLhE]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2008). Low credibility.

Guidelines on the use of second-generation antipsychotics and physical health monitoring have begun to include information on hyperprolactinemia, and generally recommend that patients should be queried about possible symptoms related to elevated prolactin: menstrual abnormalities, galactorrhea and sexual dysfunction. However, with only two exceptions, none of the guidelines suggest performing baseline plasma prolactin levels. Although several of the guidelines mention the potential for hyperprolactinemia to be associated with osteopenia and osteoporosis, there is no guidance how to monitor for this. Product labeling for the different antipsychotics inform the clinician about potential risks but are not helpful with precise monitoring recommendations. The internal medicine literature contains important information regarding the pulsatile secretion of prolactin, differential diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia, and plasma levels of prolactin usually associated with certain symptoms that would be useful for the prescriber of antipsychotics to be aware of. The prudent clinician should consider obtaining a baseline plasma prolactin level and at least one follow-up measurement when starting any patient on a new antipsychotic. This will help guide clinical decisions about antipsychotic dosage, switching antipsychotic medications, or considering ancillary treatments to protect bone mass. These decisions would be within the context of considering other adverse events as well as the overall effectiveness of the antipsychotic medication being used.

### Dopamine as a prolactin (PRL) inhibitor [^1128YZCv]. Endocrine Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Dopamine is a small and relatively simple molecule that fulfills diverse functions. Within the brain, it acts as a classical neurotransmitter whose attenuation or overactivity can result in disorders such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. Major advances in the cloning and characterization of biosynthetic enzymes, transporters, and receptors have increased our knowledge regarding the metabolism, release, reuptake, and mechanism of action of dopamine. Dopamine reaches the pituitary via hypophysial portal blood from several hypothalamic nerve tracts that are regulated by PRL itself, estrogens, and several neuropeptides and neurotransmitters. Dopamine binds to type-2 dopamine receptors that are functionally linked to membrane channels and G proteins and suppresses the high intrinsic secretory activity of the pituitary lactotrophs. In addition to inhibiting PRL release by controlling calcium fluxes, dopamine activates several interacting intracellular signaling pathways and suppresses PRL gene expression and lactotroph proliferation. Thus, PRL homeostasis should be viewed in the context of a fine balance between the action of dopamine as an inhibitor and the many hypothalamic, systemic, and local factors acting as stimulators, none of which has yet emerged as a primary PRL releasing factor. The generation of transgenic animals with overexpressed or mutated genes expanded our understanding of dopamine-PRL interactions and the physiological consequences of their perturbations. PRL release in humans, which differs in many respects from that in laboratory animals, is affected by several drugs used in clinical practice. Hyperprolactinemia is a major neuroendocrine-related cause of reproductive disturbances in both men and women. The treatment of hyperprolactinemia has greatly benefited from the generation of progressively more effective and selective dopaminergic drugs.

### Hormonal adaptations to weight loss: responses to an oral glucose load 4 weeks after obesity surgery and low-energy diet [^115HuWhJ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

4.5 and calcium homeostasis

Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a quite common complication of OS, mostly due to calcium and vitamin D malabsorption. A 10‐year follow‐up study on gastric bypass highlighted remarkably reduced bone mineral density, though with no changes in calcium, vitamin D or PTH levels. However, data on short‐term follow‐ups are lacking. Surprisingly, we found suppressed fasting PTH levels after OS, but not after LED. This might depend on the fact that in our cohort calcium levels were increased after OS, probably due to adequate pharmacological substitution. Also, vitamin D substitution after OS might have impacted. Unfortunately, levels of vitamin D were not measured. Primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism are associated with insulin resistance, possibly because of altered insulin signalling in the adipose tissue. On the other hand, insulin and gut hormones have been suggested to dampen PTH secretion in the post‐prandial state.PTH secretion is inhibited during nutrient intake, and this is in line with our results. Indeed, the gut‐islet‐parathyroid crosstalk retains several mysteries to be unveiled. Possibly, lower PTH levels in the absence of micronutrient deficiency is one of the possible mechanisms for improved glucose homeostasis after OS.

4.6 Prolactin

The role of prolactin in metabolic regulation has recently drawn increasing attention. Since long ago, prolactin has been identified as a diabetogenic hormone. In fact, individuals with hyperprolactinaemia usually display the hallmarks of metabolic syndrome and are at greater risk for dysglycaemic disorders. However, in individuals without pathological hyperprolactinaemia, higher prolactin levels seem to be associated with better glucose homeostasis. In animal models, activation of prolactin receptors in pancreatic beta‐cells promotes insulin secretion and impairs apoptosis.

An old study showed no effect of LED‐mediated weight loss in subjects with obesity on basal prolactin levels, but reduced prolactin response to thyrotropin‐releasing hormone stimulation. On the other hand, previous studies showed both unchanged and decreased basal prolactin levels after OS. We did not detect any effect of either OS or LED on basal prolactin levels, but we showed increased prolactin secretion during the OGTT 4 weeks after surgery. This could lead to beneficial effects on beta‐cell function. This outcome likely depends on the disinhibition of pituitary prolactin secretion due to a reduced dopaminergic tone in the tuberoinfundibular pathway, although the underlying mechanism is unknown. This strengthens the evidence of an OS‐specific effect on hypothalamic function.

Introduction

Prolactin is an anterior pituitary hormone, and its receptor is expressed in most peripheral organs. Its most well‐known physiological role is to support lactation, but it has broad functions in metabolic, osmoregulatory, and immunoregulatory pathways. 1 More recently, it has been discovered that prolactin is produced in adipose tissue and that the prolactin receptor is expressed in adipose tissue. 2

Several observations from animal studies and clinical experience suggest that prolactin may act as an adipocytokine that modulates the effects of obesity. In rats, elevation of prolactin is associated with increased food intake and body weight. 3 In humans with prolactinomas, weight gain is often a prominent feature and is reversible with prolactin‐lowering therapy. 4 Other metabolic abnormalities seen in prolactinomas include insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. 5 In animal models, prolactin promotes accrual of visceral adipose tissue (VAT). 6 Prolactin receptor knockout mice have reduced overall and abdominal adipose tissue. 7 In obese women, prolactin release is enhanced in proportion to body mass index (BMI) and VAT. 8

Whether variability in prolactin within the physiological range is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors is unclear. A prior community‐based study found no cross‐sectional association between prolactin and BMI in either men or women. 9 A subsequent study from the same cohort later found that prolactin was associated with higher cardiovascular and all‐cause mortality over a period of 10 years. 10

We sought to examine the associations between prolactin and changes in body composition and CVD risk factors over time.

### Hyperprolactinemia [^114d4tBq]. Pituitary (2008). Low credibility.

In several respects prolactin is unique among anterior pituitary hormones. The primary regulation of prolactin secretion is mediated through hypothalamic inhibition, and the diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia can be established without the use of stimulation or suppression tests. Documenting the presence of hyperprolactinemia is not difficult-the challenge is in identifying the cause of the hormone hypersecretion. With immunoradiometric assays falsely low levels of prolactin are occasionally seen in patients with macroadenomas and very high serum prolactin (the hook effect). Macroprolactin should be suspected when a patient with hyperprolactinemia does not present with typical clinical symptoms, and all hyperprolactinemic sera should be screened for macroprolactin. With prolactinomas, prolactin levels generally parallel tumor size. Prolactin secreting macroadenomas are typically associated with levels that exceed 250 microg/l and may exceed 1,000 microg/l. Large non-functioning adenomas also lead to hyperprolactinemia but levels virtually never exceed 94 microg/l. Acquired and isolated prolactin deficiency is rare.

### Current evaluation of amenorrhea: a committee opinion [^115dXdb8]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Amenorrhea evaluation — prolactin and macroprolactin: Circulating levels in the range of 15–20 ng/mL will exclude hyperprolactinemia as a cause of amenorrhea, and macroprolactinemia (molecular weight > 100 kDa) must be considered as a mechanism for persistently elevated prolactin; establishing this diagnosis avoids unnecessary and costly MRI imaging, and because macroprolactin is biologically inert, macroprolactinemia is unlikely to be a cause of secondary amenorrhea.

### Metabolic functions of prolactin: physiological and pathological aspects [^112Z7JzD]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2020). Medium credibility.

Prolactin is named after its vital role of promoting milk production during lactation, although it has been implicated in multiple functions within the body, including metabolism and energy homeostasis. Prolactin has been hypothesised to play a key role in driving many of the adaptations of the maternal body to allow the mother to meet the physiological demands of both pregnancy and lactation, including the high energetic demands of the growing foetus followed by milk production to support the offspring after birth. Prolactin receptors are found in many tissues involved in metabolism and food intake, such as the pancreas, liver, hypothalamus, small intestine and adipose tissue. We review the literature examining the effects of prolactin in these various tissues and how they relate to changes in function in physiological states of high prolactin, such as pregnancy and lactation, and in pathological states of hyperprolactinaemia in the adult. In many cases, whether prolactin promotes healthy metabolism or leads to dysregulation of metabolic functions is highly dependent on the situation. Overall, although prolactin may not play a major role in regulating metabolism and body weight outside of pregnancy and lactation, it definitely has the ability to contribute to metabolic function.

Figure 1.
Clinical characteristics of patients with prolactinoma. Pituitary tumor per se exerts several compressive mass effects, leading to headache, visual field defects, and hypopituitarism. Prolactin excess results in both sexes in weight gain, delayed pubertal development, hypogonadism, infertility, galactorrhea, and osteopenia or osteoporosis. Other signs and symptoms are gender-related and include in men libido reduction, erectile dysfunction, and gynecomastia; in women, oligo-amenorrhea, vaginal dryness, irritability, and depression. Created with Biorender.com.

Besides the hypogonadism-related signs and symptoms, PRL excess may exert extragonadal systemic effects. Given the direct actions of PRL and dopaminergic tone on pancreatic β cells and adipocytes, hyperprolactinemia may also induce an unfavorable metabolic profile. Increased food intake and weight gain in patients with prolactinomas have been shown to promote altered body composition, insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, and adverse lipid profile, leading to visceral obesity and metabolic syndrome in approximately one-third of patients. However, the potential impact of hyperprolactinemia-induced hypogonadism on body composition and metabolic profile cannot be excluded. Indeed, men with testosterone and dihydrotestosterone levels in the lower quartiles have been found to have a 2-fold higher risk of developing obesity and metabolic syndrome. Similarly, in 40 premenopausal hyperprolactinemic women, in whom FSH, LH, and estrogen levels were in the normal range, but their pulsatile secretion was decreased because of hyperprolactinemia, PRL excess has been found associated with hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance independently of body weight and leptin and adiponectin levels. The altered body composition, characterized by increased fat mass and reduced lean mass, together with concomitant secondary hypogonadism, contribute to decreased bone density from the direct and indirect (ie, hyperprolactinemia-induced hypogonadism) effects of prolactin on bone physiology, early alterations in bone turnover markers, reduced bone mass mainly in trabecular rather than cortical bone, delayed peak bone mass acquisition, and high risk of vertebral fractures in both sexes.

### Prolactin-secreting adenomas: pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management [^113kKVTw]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hyperprolactinemia:

- **Definition**: Hyperprolactinemia is defined as a sustained elevation of serum prolactin above normal levels, typically > 25 ng/mL in nonpregnant women and > 20 ng/mL in men. It may occur physiologically (pregnancy, stress), pharmacologically (dopamine antagonists), or pathologically (pituitary adenomas, hypothyroidism, CKD).
- **Pathophysiology**: Prolactin secretion is normally inhibited by hypothalamic dopamine acting on D2 receptors in lactotrophs. Loss of this inhibition, whether from drugs, lesions, or stalk compression, results in excess prolactin release. Estrogens and thyrotropin-releasing hormone enhance secretion. Chronically high prolactin suppresses GnRH, reducing LH and FSH, which causes hypogonadism, infertility, and sexual dysfunction.
- **Epidemiology**: Hyperprolactinemia is one of the most common endocrine disorders. It affects about 15–20% of women evaluated for infertility. Drug-induced causes are most frequent, followed by prolactinomas, hypothyroidism, and renal disease. Prolactinomas account for 30–40% of pituitary tumors, with microadenomas more common in women and macroadenomas in men.
- **Risk factors**: Major risk factors include use of antipsychotics, antidepressants, opiates, and antiemetics. Physiological triggers include pregnancy, lactation, nipple stimulation, and stress. Pathologic causes include pituitary adenoma, hypothyroidism, chronic kidney or liver disease, chest wall injury, and epilepsy. Genetic syndromes such as MEN1 and familial isolated pituitary adenoma also increase risk.
- **Disease course**: The clinical course depends on etiology. Physiologic and drug-induced forms are often mild and reversible, whereas adenomas produce persistent elevations. Women present with amenorrhea, galactorrhea, infertility, or low libido. Men present with decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, infertility, or rarely gynecomastia. Large tumors may cause headache, visual loss, or hypopituitarism.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Prognosis is excellent when the cause is identified and treated. Drug- or disease-related hyperprolactinemia resolves after withdrawal or correction of the underlying condition. Dopamine agonists such as cabergoline normalize prolactin in 70–90% of prolactinoma cases and restore fertility in most women. Surgery is reserved for resistant or compressive tumors. Untreated cases may lead to chronic hypogonadism, infertility, and bone loss.

### Prolactin and dopamine: what is the connection? A review article [^115SESKP]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2008). Low credibility.

Dopamine (DA) holds a predominant role in the regulation of prolactin (PRL) secretion. Through a direct effect on anterior pituitary lactotrophs, DA inhibits the basally high-secretory tone of the cell. It accomplishes this by binding to D2 receptors expressed on the cell membrane of the lactotroph, activation of which results in a reduction of PRL exocytosis and gene expression by a variety of intracellular signalling mechanisms. The hypothalamic dopaminergic neurons, which provide DA to the anterior pituitary gland, are themselves regulated by feedback from PRL through a 'short-loop feedback mechanism'. A variety of other modulators of prolactin secretion act at the hypothalamic level by either disinhibition of the dopaminergic tone (e.g. serotonin, GABA, oestrogens and opioids) or by reinforcing it (e.g. substance P). All typical antipsychotic medications are associated with sustained hyperprolactinaemia due to their high affinity for the D2 receptor and their slow dissociation from the receptor once bound, but atypicals differ quite dramatically in their propensity to cause prolonged high prolactin levels. Of those atypicals that are associated with prolactin elevation, the main causative factor appears to be a higher peripheral-to-central dopamine receptor potency of either the parent drug or its active metabolite (e.g. risperidone, 9-hydroxy-risperidone and amisulpride). Antipsychotics that easily cross the blood-brain barrier and exhibit fast dissociation from the dopamine receptor once bound do not result in sustained hyperprolactinaemia.
