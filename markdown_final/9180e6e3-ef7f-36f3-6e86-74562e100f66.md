## Question

levaquin dose for uti

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate Levaquin (levofloxacin) dose for urinary tract infections, including how it varies by infection type, route, and special circumstances. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical classification of UTIs and how that drives dose and duration. Then, I should verify the FDA-labeled dosing for oral and IV levofloxacin. Next, I will review guideline-based alternatives and stewardship cautions. After that, I need to check renal dosing adjustments and safety considerations. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, practical recommendation and note any exceptions or controversies that might change practice locally.

> Let me first confirm the clinical categories because dosing hinges on them: uncomplicated cystitis (lower tract, otherwise healthy), complicated UTI (structural or functional urinary tract abnormalities, male sex, diabetes, immunocompromise, or indwelling catheter), and acute pyelonephritis (upper tract infection), with the latter two often grouped together for dosing purposes in labeling and guidelines [^114RvMwt] [^117Smpys].

> I will now examine uncomplicated cystitis dosing. The FDA label specifies 250 mg orally once daily for 3 days for uncomplicated cystitis, and this is the standard regimen when levofloxacin is used, which should be reserved for patients with no suitable alternatives due to safety concerns and resistance risk [^114Frqsi] [^112eAVLe]. Wait, let me verify the IV option: yes, 250 mg IV once daily for 3 days is also labeled for uncomplicated cystitis, though oral therapy is preferred when feasible [^115p3qNt].

> Next, I should review complicated UTI and acute pyelonephritis dosing. The FDA supports two evidence-based options: 750 mg orally or IV once daily for 5 days, or 500 mg orally or IV once daily for 7–10 days, with the 750 mg 5-day regimen supported by a randomized trial showing noninferiority to ciprofloxacin for 10 days in cUTI/AP and by FDA clinical studies summarized in the label [^114Frqsi] [^113HMXSA] [^111xrsYN]. Hold on, I should verify the 500 mg 7–10 day option: multiple authoritative sources list 500 mg daily for 7–10 days as acceptable, aligning with guideline flexibility for cUTI/AP [^114RvMwt] [^11642ttZ].

> Let me consider special populations and stewardship cautions. For catheter-associated UTI in non-severely ill patients, IDSA suggests that 5 days of levofloxacin can be considered when clinically appropriate, reflecting a shift toward shorter effective courses to minimize adverse effects and resistance [^111SqEwW] [^117Smpys]. I should double-check resistance guidance: IDSA advises avoiding fluoroquinolones empirically if there has been prior fluoroquinolone exposure in the past 12 months due to resistance risk, reinforcing the need to check local antibiograms and prior antibiotic use before choosing levofloxacin [^111s2fcA].

> Now, I need to ensure renal dosing is addressed. For creatinine clearance less than 50 mL/min, dose adjustments are required. For example, at eGFR 10–20 mL/min/1.73 m², typical starting doses of 250–500 mg should be reduced to a maximum of 125 mg with extended intervals of every 24–48 hours, and for eGFR less than 10 mL/min/1.73 m², similar conservative dosing with q24–48h intervals applies, so I should confirm kidney function before finalizing the regimen [^115NFXp5] [^116Lr7Fe] [^113t89eA].

> I should confirm safety and boxed warnings. Fluoroquinolones carry risks including tendinopathy, CNS effects, dysglycemia, and C. difficile infection; levofloxacin is generally reserved for patients who cannot take or have failed first-line agents like nitrofurantoin, TMP-SMX, or fosfomycin, and contemporary data reinforce that first-line therapies outperform fluoroquinolones for uncomplicated UTI outcomes, which supports stewardship-first prescribing [^112eAVLe] [^11166m3B] [^112e6Ry3].

> But wait, what if someone asks about prostatitis or other urologic contexts. For acute bacterial prostatitis, levofloxacin 500 mg daily for 4–6 weeks is standard, which is a different entity than UTI and should not be conflated with cystitis or pyelonephritis dosing, so I need to keep that separate in counseling [^113sGgaN].

> Let me synthesize a practical answer. For uncomplicated cystitis, use levofloxacin 250 mg orally once daily for 3 days, reserving it for patients with no suitable alternatives. For complicated UTI or acute pyelonephritis, use either 750 mg orally or IV once daily for 5 days, or 500 mg orally or IV once daily for 7–10 days, chosen based on severity, pathogen risk, and patient-specific factors. Always adjust for renal function if creatinine clearance is below 50 mL/min and avoid empiric fluoroquinolones when there has been recent fluoroquinolone exposure or high local resistance, verifying susceptibilities when available [^114Frqsi] [^11642ttZ] [^111s2fcA] [^113t89eA].

---

Levaquin (levofloxacin) is dosed for UTIs based on severity and site of infection: **250 mg once daily for 3 days** for uncomplicated cystitis [^114Frqsi], and **750 mg once daily for 5 days** for complicated UTI or pyelonephritis [^113HMXSA]. For severe infections or when oral therapy is not feasible, **500–750 mg IV once daily** is used, typically for 7–10 days [^114RvMwt] [^11642ttZ]. Adjust dose for renal impairment if creatinine clearance is < 50 mL/min [^113t89eA], and reserve levofloxacin for patients with no suitable alternatives due to safety concerns [^112eAVLe].

## Recommended dosing regimens

| **Clinical indication** | **Recommended dose** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|
| Uncomplicated cystitis | 250 mg orally once daily | 3 days [^114Frqsi] |
| Complicated UTI or pyelonephritis | 750 mg orally once daily | 5 days [^113HMXSA] |
| Severe infection or IV therapy required | 500–750 mg IV once daily | 7–10 days [^114RvMwt] [^11642ttZ] |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosing regimens

- **Uncomplicated cystitis**: A 3-day course of 250 mg once daily is effective and minimizes resistance risk [^notfound].
- **Complicated UTI or pyelonephritis**: A 5-day course of 750 mg once daily is noninferior to longer regimens and supported by randomized trials [^113HMXSA].
- **Severe infections**: IV therapy at 500–750 mg once daily for 7–10 days is standard, with step-down to oral therapy when stable [^114RvMwt] [^11642ttZ].

---

## Special considerations

### Renal impairment

Adjust dosing for creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min: for **eGFR 10–20 mL/min/1.73 m²**, use 250–500 mg every 24–48 hours (max 125 mg) [^115NFXp5]; for **eGFR < 10 mL/min/1.73 m²**, use 250–500 mg every 24–48 hours (max 125 mg) [^116Lr7Fe].

---

### Patient-specific factors

Elderly patients have a higher risk of adverse effects (e.g. QT prolongation, tendon rupture) [^1176e9cw]; use caution and monitor closely. Pregnant or breastfeeding patients should avoid levofloxacin unless no alternatives exist, given potential fetal and infant risks.

---

## Safety and tolerability

Common adverse effects include gastrointestinal upset, headache, and insomnia; **serious adverse effects** include tendon rupture, QT prolongation, CNS effects, and C. difficile infection [^1176e9cw]. Reserve levofloxacin for patients with no suitable alternatives and counsel on adverse effects [^112eAVLe].

---

## Comparison with alternative antibiotics

| **Antibiotic** | **Dose** | **Duration** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Nitrofurantoin | 100 mg BID | 5 days | First-line for uncomplicated cystitis; not for pyelonephritis |
| Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole | 160/800 mg BID | 3 days | First-line if resistance ≤ 20% |
| Ciprofloxacin | 500 mg BID | 3–7 days | Alternative fluoroquinolone |
| Fosfomycin | 3 g single dose | Single dose | Alternative for uncomplicated cystitis |

---

Levaquin is effective for UTIs, but **use the lowest effective dose and shortest duration** to balance efficacy and safety [^117Smpys].

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the 250 mg dose, 10 day regimen of levofloxacin, 567 patients with uncomplicated UTI, mild-to-moderate cUTI, and mild-to-moderate AP were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, multicenter clinical trial conducted in the U.S. from June 1993 to January 1995 comparing levofloxacin 250 mg orally once daily for 10 days (285 patients) with ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 10 days (282 patients). Patients with a resistant pathogen, recurrent UTI, women over age 55 years, and with an indwelling catheter were initially excluded, prior to protocol amendment which took place after 30% of enrollment.

Objectives

A clinical study was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of levofloxacin 750 mg once daily for 5 days to ciprofloxacin twice daily for 10 days for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) or acute pyelonephritis (AP).

Methods

A multicenter, double-blind, randomized, noninferiority study enrolled subjects with AP or cUTI. Subjects received either levofloxacin 750 mg intravenously or orally once daily for 5 days or ciprofloxacin 400 mg intravenously and/or ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 10 days and were evaluated at end of therapy, posttherapy, and poststudy for microbiologic eradication and clinical outcome.

Results

A total of 1109 subjects were enrolled; 619 with confirmed diagnosis of AP or cUTI and a study entry uropathogen with a colony count 10⁵ CFU/mL or greater and were included in the modified intent-to-treat population. Five hundred six subjects met all criteria for inclusion and were included in the microbiologically evaluable population. At end of therapy, eradication rates in the modified intent-to-treat population were 79.8% for levofloxacin and 77.5% for ciprofloxacin-treated subjects (95% CI, -8.8% to 4.1%). In the microbiologically evaluable population, eradication rates were 88.3% for levofloxacin and 86.7% for ciprofloxacin-treated subjects (95% CI, -7.4% to 4.2%). Outcomes were comparable for the 2 treatments at posttherapy and poststudy.

Conclusions

This study demonstrates that both drug regimens are safe and effective and that a 5-day course of therapy with levofloxacin, administered at a dose of 750 mg once daily, is noninferior to a 10-day course of therapy with ciprofloxacin for the treatment of AP and cUTI.

### The expanding role of fluoroquinolones [^111SR2jC]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

There has been a growing rate of resistance among common urinary tract pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, to traditional antimicrobial therapies including the "gold standard" trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). Consequently, fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents have taken on an expanding management role for UTIs. In fact, the recent Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical management guidelines for UTI recommend fluoroquinolones as first-line therapy for uncomplicated UTI in areas where resistance is likely to be of concern. Fluoroquinolones have demonstrated high bacteriologic and clinical cure rates, as well as low rates of resistance, among most common uropathogens. There are currently 7 fluoroquinolones with indications for UTI in the United States. However, only 3 are commonly used: levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and, to a lesser extent, gatifloxacin. Many of the fluoroquinolone agents have once-daily dosing regimens, enhancing patient adherence. In addition, levofloxacin and gatifloxacin have same-dose bioequivalency between their intravenous and oral formulations, allowing for "switch" or step-down therapy from parenteral to oral formulations of the same agent at the same dose. Fluoroquinolones are indicated for the management of acute uncomplicated UTIs, as well as complicated and severe UTI and pyelonephritis, in adults. They are the first-line treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis in patients who cannot tolerate sulfonamides or TMP, who live in geographic areas with known resistance > 10% to 20% to TMP-SMX, or who have risk factors for such resistance. Fluoroquinolone properties include a broad spectrum of coverage, low rates of resistance, and good safety profiles.

### 5-day versus 10-day course of fluoroquinolones in outpatient males with a urinary tract infection (UTI) [^115MxJSK]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Current guidelines classify urinary tract infections (UTIs) in males as complicated and recommend longer treatment than for UTIs in females. The objective of this study is to demonstrate that males with UTIs may be successfully treated with an outpatient 5-day course of levofloxacin.

Methods

Data were obtained from a previously conducted clinical trial (www.clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00210886), a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, noninferiority study comparing levofloxacin 750 mg intravenously/by mouth once daily for 5 days and ciprofloxacin 400/500 mg intravenously/by mouth twice daily for 10 days in complicated UTI (cUTI). The current study was a post hoc, subgroup analysis of male and female subjects with cUTI. Subjects were stratified into groups based on sex and antibiotic received. The subjects were analyzed at the end of therapy (EOT) and post therapy (PT) for clinical success rates, defined as no further need for antimicrobial treatment.

Results

Totals of 427 patients (224 male, 203 female) and 350 patients (189 male, 161 female) were included in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population and microbiologically evaluable (ME) populations, respectively. Clinical success rates between males and females were not statistically different between antibiotic groups in either the mITT or ME populations at EOT or PT.

Conclusion

This study demonstrates that males with UTI may be treated with a shorter course of antimicrobial therapy for UTI than previously recommended.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^117GrFR3]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) oral antibiotics — dose for patients with normal renal function includes the following regimens: Amoxicillin-clavulanate 875mg-125mg every 8 to 12 hours (note: "Other regimens may be more effective"); Cefpodoxime 200mg to 400mg every 12 hours; Ceftibuten 9mg/kg daily (children) and 400mg daily or 200mg every 12 hours (adults); Cefuroxime 500mg every 12 hours; Cephalexin 500mg to 1000mg every 6 hours (note: "Other regimens may be more effective"); Ciprofloxacin 500mg to 750mg every 12 hours; Levofloxacin 500mg to 750mg daily; Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 800mg-160mg every 12 hours. For other oral beta-lactams (e.g. amoxicillin, cefadroxil, cefaclor, cefdinir), comparative clinical outcomes data vs highly bioavailable oral alternatives are more limited and/or discouraging; consider use with infectious disease pharmacist consultation if alternatives are not available.

### Comparison of the effectiveness of single-dose levofloxacin with single-dose fosfomycin pre-urodynamic study related to the incidence of urinary tract infection: a randomized controlled trial [^114Guh3P]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

These results were further supported by a female-focused systematic review conducted by Benseler et al. in 2020. The review analyzed three randomized controlled trials involving a total of 325 women and found that antibiotic prophylaxis may reduce the rate of bacteriuria after urodynamic studies (pooled 5/206 vs. 8/119; OR ≈ 0.47). However, due to very low event counts, the effect on symptomatic urinary tract infections remained inconclusive (2/206 vs. 3/119). A sub-analysis of the individual studies identified levofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and nitrofurantoin as the most effective agents, with levofloxacin in particular reducing bacteriuria cases from 6/63 in the placebo group to 1/59 in the prophylaxis group.

Local evidence echoes these findings: a randomized controlled trial by Rahardjo et al. (2016) conducted in our own setting demonstrated a markedly lower post-UDS UTI rate with levofloxacin prophylaxis (12.7%) versus placebo (28.6%; p = 0.028), against an overall baseline incidence of 20.6%. (5) Although the newest EAU guidance advises against fluoroquinolone prophylaxis because of growing resistance, levofloxacin was retained in our protocol because, at the time of study initiation, it was the agent most widely available, supported by local susceptibility patterns, and familiar to practicing clinicians.

Taken together, the global evidence from Wu et al. the sex-specific analysis by Benseler et al. and our own institutional RCT provided a cogent rationale for incorporating single-dose levofloxacin prophylaxis when this study was launched. Our results now offer context-specific data that can guide Indonesia's gradual alignment with updated international recommendations while addressing the practical realities of local healthcare delivery.

A study by Raharjo et al. previously found an incidence rate of UTI at 19.8%, which did not differ significantly from the incidence rate observed in the current study, at 20.9%. (5) The incidence rate of post-urodynamic UTI in previous studies varies widely, ranging from 1.5–36%. (2–3) This may be attributed to differences in the duration of the examination, catheter insertion techniques, differences in the study population, including age, risk factors for post-UDS UTI, differences in UDS examination techniques and methods, and differences in the operational definitions and criteria used to establish the diagnosis of UTI.

### Comparison of the effectiveness of single-dose levofloxacin with single-dose fosfomycin pre-urodynamic study related to the incidence of urinary tract infection: a randomized controlled trial [^116cbCv8]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Updated guidance from the European Association of Urology (2024) does not recommend routine antimicrobial prophylaxis for urodynamic testing. In contrast, the American Urological Association (2020 Best-Practice Statement) recommends prophylaxis for selected high-risk patients, including those with neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction, immunosuppressed individuals (such as transplant recipients), patients with known or suspected abnormalities of the urinary tract who have undergone recent genitourinary instrumentation, and those recently exposed to antimicrobials, as these groups are considered at increased risk for urinary tract infection (UTI). These recommendations were developed based on evolving evidence and not in isolation from prior studies.

A 2021 meta-analysis by Wu X-Y et al. which included 1,789 participants across twelve randomized trials, demonstrated that prophylactic antibiotics significantly reduced post-UDS bacteriuria (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.30–0.60) and decreased the incidence of symptomatic urinary tract infections by approximately one-third (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.48–0.88). The findings were consistent across studies, showing minimal heterogeneity and supporting the short-term benefit of antimicrobial prophylaxis in select patient populations.

### Appropriate antibiotic treatment of genitourinary infections in hospitalized patients [^1113oSqY]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The etiology of urinary tract infections (UTIs) that require hospitalization, whether they originate in the hospital or in the community, is changing, with increasing findings of gram-positive organisms. The Council for Appropriate and Rational Antibiotic Therapy (CARAT) criteria recommend evaluating treatment choices on the basis of sound clinical evidence, potential for therapeutic benefits, safety, optimal duration of treatment, and cost-efficacy in order to improve antibiotic treatment. Evidence-based guidelines recommend fluoroquinolones for the treatment of patients with cases of pyelonephritis or bacterial prostatitis severe enough to warrant hospitalization. For other serious UTIs, fluoroquinolones are usually recommended either when traditional agents have failed or when resistance to traditional agents is high. Even in the context of rapidly changing antimicrobial resistance patterns, the fluoroquinolones have maintained consistent, well-tolerated efficacy against many of the principal organisms responsible for UTIs, and are generally considered safe for most patients. To increase the likelihood of treatment success with first-line therapy, an antimicrobial agent must attain sufficient concentrations in the target tissue or in the urine for an appropriate amount of time. Both levofloxacin and gatifloxacin are excreted unchanged in the urine in concentrations that far exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration of most uropathogens. Factors that affect cost-effectiveness that should be considered include acquisition costs as well as treatment success and ease of use for hospital staff.

### Comparison of the effectiveness of single-dose levofloxacin with single-dose fosfomycin pre-urodynamic study related to the incidence of urinary tract infection: a randomized controlled trial [^1166iW6x]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Several studies did not support the routine use of antibiotic prophylaxis, with findings showing no significant difference in the occurrence of post-UDS UTI between patients who received prophylactic antibiotics and those who did not. On the other hand, 500 mg levofloxacin administered over three days decreased the occurrence rate compared to placebo from 28.6 to 12.7%, according to the study by Rahardjo, et al. This evidence highlights the clinical benefit of administering antibiotics prior to UDS in reducing the risk of UTI in our center. Therefore, in the present study, a placebo arm was not included, as it would have been ethically inappropriate to withhold prophylactic antibiotics given prior findings of significant benefit over placebo. Instead, this randomized controlled trial was designed to compare two active regimens — fosfomycin and levofloxacin — to determine which agent is more effective and potentially safer as a single-dose prophylactic option.

Other studies observed no discernible difference between taking 500 mg of levofloxacin once a day for three days versus giving it as a single dosage. However, a single dose is recommended due to being more cost-effective, simpler, and reducing the potential for antibiotic resistance. The administration of prophylactic antibiotic for UDS is recommended, as it is proven to reduce bacteriuria and decrease the risk of UTI. To date, E. coli remains the most common cause of UTI, while data from the Clinical Pathology Department of Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo National Referral Hospital indicate that fosfomycin has better sensitivity compared to levofloxacin against E. coli isolates. This is the first randomized trial comparing the prophylactic use of the antibiotics fosfomycin and levofloxacin to lower the incidence of UTIs following UDS.

Non-β-lactam therapy for AmpC-E urinary and nonurinary infections — preferred and alternative agents. Preferred treatment options for uncomplicated cystitis caused by AmpC-E are nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX); ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or an aminoglycoside (as a single dose) are alternative options for AmpC-E uncomplicated cystitis. For pyelonephritis or complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) caused by AmpC-E, TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin are preferred, with aminoglycosides as alternative options when resistance or toxicities preclude the use of TMP-SMX or fluoroquinolones. For AmpC-E infections outside of the urinary tract, transitioning from cefepime to oral TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin should be considered, if susceptibility is demonstrated.

Background

Urodynamic study (UDS) is an important examination in urology, often used to assist in diagnosing lower urinary tract functional disorders. The frequency of this examination has consistently increased every year. However, due to its invasive nature, UDS poses a risk of post-examination urinary tract infections (UTIs). The incidence rate of post-UDS UTI varies between 1.5–30%. Given this risk factor, patients undergoing UDS, especially those with a high risk of UTIs, are recommended to receive prophylactic antibiotics. In their research, Rahardjo et al. found that the use of levofloxacin as post-UDS prophylactic antibiotic for 3 days can reduce the risk of UTI by 55% compared to placebo. However, the study observed no difference between using a single dose of 500 mg levofloxacin pre-UDS and 500 mg levofloxacin for 3 days post-UDS.

The most common etiologic pathogen of UTI is E. coli. Data from the Clinical Pathology Department of Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo National Referral Hospital from July to December 2021 revealed that 33% of 415 E. coli isolates cultured from urine specimens were sensitive to levofloxacin, a figure that is lower when compared to fosfomycin, where a sensitivity rate of 84% was found in 219 E. coli isolates. Oral levofloxacin has been the primary antibiotic used before urodynamic studies to prevent post-UDS UTI. However, the increased use of fluoroquinolone antibiotics has led to a decrease in levofloxacin sensitivity. Levofloxacin resistance among bacterial isolates in Indonesian hospitals is notable, with 35.8% of isolates showing resistance. Levofloxacin resistance rates began at 1.2% in 1988 and have progressively increased to 25% by the end of 2014, reaching 38.1% by 2017 in the United States.

Levofloxacin resistance is a growing concern, particularly for patients undergoing urodynamic studies. Understanding local resistance patterns and employing appropriate strategies for prevention and treatment can help manage the risks associated with infections in this population. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of using a single dose of 500 mg levofloxacin and a single dose of 3 g fosfomycin, administered one hour prior to a UDS examination as prophylactic antibiotics to prevent UTIs.

### Maintaining fluoroquinolone class efficacy: review of influencing factors [^113SJRJb]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Given the defined strategy of selecting the agent with the best pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile against the known or suspected pathogen, an appropriate therapeutic choice for most serious infections, such as nosocomial pneumonia in which P. aeruginosa is a known or suspected pathogen, would currently include ciprofloxacin in combination with an antipseudomonal β-lactam or an aminoglycoside antibiotic. This recommendation is based on the lower MIC 90 and mutant prevention concentrations for this fluoroquinolone against P. aeruginosa and higher Cmax/MIC and AUC/MIC ratios compared to other members of the class. Likewise, for most other gram-negative infections of the skin and urinary tract, including P. aeruginosa infections, ciprofloxacin monotherapy is appropriate.

Ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and gatifloxain all achieve high concentrations in urine; thus, they would all be appropriate choices for treating urinary tract infections in the community. Ciprofloxacin would be the most appropriate therapy in cases where P. aeruginosa is a known or suspected pathogen. For other gram-negative infections, levofloxacin or gatifloxacin should be prescribed in appropriate doses to surpass the mutant prevention concentrations at the infection site.

For infections in which S. pneumoniae is anticipated to be the most likely pathogen (e.g. community-acquired pneumonia), moxifloxacin, which currently has the best antipneumococcal pharmacodynamic activity and the lowest mutant prevention concentrations against this organism, would represent a prudent therapeutic choice. By contrast, levofloxacin MIC 90 s against S. pneumoniae are significantly higher than those of moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin. The AUC/MICs and Cmax/MICs are also lower for levofloxacin against S. pneumoniae, and serum concentrations of a standard dose of levofloxacin for community-acquired pneumonia do not reach the mutant prevention concentrations for S. pneumoniae. For these reasons, levofloxacin may not be the best choice for infections caused by S. pneumoniae. Furthermore, recent reports of levofloxacin failures in cases of community-acquired pneumonia caused by S. pneumoniae evoke concern.

The targeted strategy proposed in this review is being implemented in a variety of institutions since the introduction of the third-generation fluoroquinolones. Documenting the effect of this approach on hospital susceptibilities over time will be important. Additionally, susceptiblities in these hospitals need to be compared to those in hospitals that use a single fluoroquinolone more broadly.

### Ceftolozane-tazobactam compared with levofloxacin in the treatment of complicated urinary-tract infections, including pyelonephritis: a randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial (ASPECT-cUTI) [^114HZzu4]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Treatment of complicated urinary-tract infections is challenging due to rising antimicrobial resistance. We assessed the efficacy and safety of ceftolozane-tazobactam, a novel antibacterial with Gram-negative activity, in the treatment of patients with complicated lower-urinary-tract infections or pyelonephritis.

Methods

ASPECT-cUTI was a randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, non-inferiority trial done in 209 centres in 25 countries. Between July, 2011, and September, 2013, hospital inpatients aged 18 years or older who had pyuria and a diagnosis of a complicated lower-urinary-tract infection or pyelonephritis were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive intravenous 1.5 g ceftolozane-tazobactam every 8 h or intravenous high-dose (750 mg) levofloxacin once daily for 7 days. The randomisation schedule was computer generated in blocks of four and stratified by study site. The next allocation was obtained by the study site pharmacist via an interactive voice-response system. The primary endpoint was a composite of microbiological eradication and clinical cure 5–9 days after treatment in the microbiological modified intention-to-treat (MITT) population, with a non-inferiority margin of 10%. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT01345929 and NCT01345955.

Findings

Of 1083 patients enrolled, 800 (73.9%), of whom 656 (82.0%) had pyelonephritis, were included in the microbiological MITT population. Ceftolozane-tazobactam was non-inferior to levofloxacin for composite cure (306 [76.9%] of 398 vs 275 [68.4%] of 402, 95% CI 2.3–14.6) and, as the lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI around the treatment difference was positive and greater than zero, superiority was indicated. Adverse event profiles were similar in the two treatment groups and were mainly non-serious.

Interpretation

Treatment with ceftolozane-tazobactam led to better responses than high-dose levofloxacin in patients with complicated lower-urinary-tract infections or pyelonephritis.

Question 1.2 — ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) pyelonephritis or complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) treatment: Suggested approach states that TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin are preferred treatment options for pyelonephritis or cUTIs caused by ESBL-E, with ertapenem, meropenem, and imipenem-cilastatin preferred when resistance or toxicities preclude TMP-SMX or fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides as alternative options. The rationale specifies that these agents are preferred assuming in vitro susceptibility; carbapenems are also preferred when resistance or toxicities prevent use or early if the patient is critically ill, and if a carbapenem is initiated and susceptibility to TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin is demonstrated, transitioning to oral formulations is preferred over completing a carbapenem course. Aminoglycosides are considered alternative because of nephrotoxicity risk; in a clinical trial of 609 adults receiving plazomicin once daily compared to meropenem for cUTI and pyelonephritis, an increase in serum creatinine of ≥ 0.5 mg above baseline occurred in 7% vs 4%. Additional considerations include that in 2023 the CLSI revised gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin breakpoints for Enterobacterales; aminoglycosides may be reasonable for completing treatment courses given prolonged renal cortical activity and convenience of once daily dosing, and duration-dependent nephrotoxicity risks should be considered. Fosfomycin is not suggested for pyelonephritis or cUTI given limited renal parenchymal concentrations; more data are needed, and a clinical trial of 97 women with E. coli pyelonephritis reported approximately half with bacteremia, up to 5 days of IV therapy, and participants subsequently transitioned to either once-daily 3 g.

### Comparison of the effectiveness of single-dose levofloxacin with single-dose fosfomycin pre-urodynamic study related to the incidence of urinary tract infection: a randomized controlled trial [^114Mzqr9]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The purpose of a UDS examination is to find anomalies in the lower urinary tract. A urinary catheter must be inserted for this invasive treatment. Despite the use of aseptic procedures prior to the examination, the risk of developing a UTI afterwards remain. E. coli is the most common etiologic pathogen causing post-UDS UTI. Given this risk, the use of prophylactic antibiotics is recommended to reduce the incidence of UTI following UDS. The American Urology Association (AUA) advises the administration of a single-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) prior to the urodynamic testing procedure, with first- or second-generation cephalosporin as an alternative antimicrobial prophylaxis. Similarly, the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines suggest that the choice of antibiotic should be guided by local resistance patterns and patient-specific factors. Common options include fluoroquinolones or cephalosporins, with adjustments based on local bacterial resistance data. In previous studies conducted in several hospitals in Indonesia, a single dose of 500 mg levofloxacin has been the preferred choice before performing UDS. A study by the Clinical Pathology Department of Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo National Referral Hospital showed that fosfomycin has better sensitivity compared to levofloxacin against E. coli isolates. This is particularly relevant because levofloxacin has been the primary antibiotic used as prophylaxis prior to urodynamic studies in Indonesia, as supported by previous clinical trials. However, due to the higher sensitivity profile of fosfomycin among Indonesian patients, as shown in the local microbiological surveillance data, it was selected as a comparator in this study. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and nitrofurantoin, although commonly used in international guidelines, were not included in this study because they are not routinely used as prophylactic antibiotics for UDS in Indonesia and have shown lower local sensitivity profiles. Therefore, this study was designed to directly compare fosfomycin and levofloxacin as single-dose prophylactic regimens to assess their effectiveness in reducing the incidence of post-UDS urinary tract infections.

Uncomplicated cystitis caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) — agents with expected activity and alternatives — includes nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin, which all achieve high concentrations in urine and are expected to be effective for uncomplicated CRE cystitis if the isolate is susceptible. A single dose of an aminoglycoside is an alternative option; oral fosfomycin is an alternative for uncomplicated cystitis caused by Escherichia coli, including if carbapenem resistant; and colistin is an alternative agent that converts to its active form in the urinary tract. Treatment suggestions for CRE infections listed below assume that in vitro activity of preferred and alternative antibiotics has been demonstrated.

Study design

This investigation was conducted in a referral hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia, and was a prospective single-center randomized clinical trial with balanced randomization [1:1]. Based on the proportion calculation for two separate groups from prior literature, the sample size for this study was determined using the guidelines provided in "Fundamentals of Clinical Research Methodology". We determined the overall sample size to be 126 patients. Data were collected using a successive sampling technique until the necessary sample size was attained. Following an eligibility screening, these patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups. The random allocation sequence was generated using a computer program to ensure randomization in a ratio 1:1 to either the fosfomycin group and levofloxacin group. The random allocation sequence was generated by an independent statistician who was not involved in the trial's conduct or analysis. Participant enrollment was carried out by the clinical research team, who verified eligibility criteria but were blinded to the allocation sequence. An independent team, separate from the corresponding author and contributing authors, implemented the allocation sequence and assigned participants to their respective interventions. This independent team ensured allocation concealment throughout the process to prevent any potential bias. Participants were blinded after assignment to interventions. To maintain blinding, the interventions (500 mg levofloxacin and 3 g fosfomycin) were provided in identical packaging, and the team administering the interventions had no knowledge of the allocation sequence.

Individuals who fulfilled all participation requirements and were not excluded were split into two groups at random: those receiving a single dose of 3 g fosfomycin and those receiving a single dose of 500 mg levofloxacin one hour prior to UDS. Participants who met the eligibility requirements were examined using normal UDS protocol. Three days after UDS, we performed a urinalysis on the patients and monitored them for clinical signs of a UTI.

### Comparison of the effectiveness of single-dose levofloxacin with single-dose fosfomycin pre-urodynamic study related to the incidence of urinary tract infection: a randomized controlled trial [^111tn45t]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

One hundred and eighty-four patients were assessed for eligibility. Fifty-eight were excluded for the following reasons: proven UTI (n = 18), being under 18 years old (n = 14), use of a urinary catheter (n = 10), prior consumption of antibiotics (n = 7), and declining to participate (n = 8). The remaining one hundred and twenty-six patients, who were willing to participate and met no exclusion criteria, were randomly divided into two groups. A single dose of 500 mg levofloxacin was administered to 63 patients, and another 63 patients received a single dose of 3 g fosfomycin, both given 1 h before undergoing UDS. Recruitment for the study began on December 30, 2022, and follow-up was completed by March 25, 2024, which also marks the study's primary and overall completion dates.

No patient from either group was lost to follow-up, resulting in a total of 126 patients included in the final analysis. A flow diagram of the randomized trial is depicted in Fig. 1. Characteristics of patients who underwent UDS in each group are presented in detail in Table 1. The average age of all participants was 52.2 years. Patients in the levofloxacin group had a mean age of 42 years (SD 17.17), while those in the fosfomycin group had a mean age of 53.99 years (SD 19.08). Based on an independent t-test, there was no statistically significant difference in age distribution between the two groups (p = 0.287).

In terms of gender distribution, 75 (58.5%) participants were male and 51 (41.5%) were female. The fosfomycin group comprised 36 males (57.14%) and 27 females (42.86%), whereas the levofloxacin group included 24 males (38.1%) and 39 females (61.9%). Chi-square analysis revealed no significant difference in gender distribution between the two treatment groups (p = 0.586).

### Comparison of the effectiveness of single-dose levofloxacin with single-dose fosfomycin pre-urodynamic study related to the incidence of urinary tract infection: a randomized controlled trial [^112VbUUY]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

This study was conducted in two referral hospitals, Cipto Mangunkusumo National Referral Hospital and Persahabatan General Hospital, which improves its generalizability compared to single-center studies. However, the findings may still not be fully generalizable to other healthcare settings or regions with differing bacterial resistance patterns or resource availability. Additionally, the sample size may have led to imprecision in effect estimates, particularly for subgroup outcomes. No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons, which should be considered when interpreting the findings.

Although no statistically significant difference was observed, the trend toward fewer positive bacterial cultures in the fosfomycin group suggests a possible clinical benefit that may warrant further study. These findings should be interpreted in the context of balancing benefits, such as bacterial sensitivity, and harms, including potential antibiotic side effects and resistance. The current national health insurance system in Indonesia does not yet cover fosfomycin as an antibiotic of choice, especially according to indications for the treatment of non-complicated acute lower urinary tract infections and prevention of urinary tract infections in trans-urethral diagnostic procedures. Therefore, in line with the results of this randomized trial, levofloxacin remains a suitable treatment option for the Indonesian population. Until this article was written, there had been no cost-effectiveness analysis conducted to compare levofloxacin and fosfomycin.

Although the study offers useful findings, its limitations should be taken into account when interpreting the results. First, the trial was restricted to non–high-risk patients, as defined by the exclusion criteria. Therefore, different results may be observed in populations with a broader or higher-risk profile. Second, the study was conducted at two tertiary referral centers in Jakarta, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other healthcare settings with differing antimicrobial resistance patterns or resource availability. Third, the follow-up period was limited to three days post-procedure, potentially missing late-onset infections or complications. Finally, the study did not assess cost-effectiveness or the long-term impact of antibiotic use on antimicrobial resistance, both of which are important considerations in guiding clinical practice.

### The best rules for antimicrobial stewardship in urogenital tract infections [^113LH3ve]. Current Opinion in Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) belong to the most common community-acquired and nosocomial infections, but therapy of UTIs is limited by resistance of pathogens and nonoptimal using of antibacterials. Narrative review of recent (2020–2018) literature dedicated to antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) in urological infections has been done.

Recent Findings

Analysis of recent 64 articles has shown following principles of AMS for UTIs: selecting the correct drug, correct dose, and shortest clinically effective duration of therapy whenever possible, is a base for optimal antimicrobial stewardship; symptomatic UTIs should be treated with antimicrobials to alleviate symptoms, and in the case of more serious infection, to prevent complications; in both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection, quantitative culture is the gold standard for diagnosis; we have to avoid prescriptions of antibiotics when possible; we have to follow European and National Guidelines; we must avoid prescription of fluoroquinolones as empiric therapy for UTIs by many reasons, one of these is urogenital tuberculosis; the choice of antibiotic for UTI should be based on local level of resistance of uropathogens.

Summary

Studies of antimicrobial stewardship in urology are limited. Nevertheless, there are some golden rules, which may help to reduce inappropriate use of antimicrobials, improve patient outcomes, reduce side effects of antibiotic therapy, decrease the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant infections, as well as decrease total costs of the therapy.

### Compliance to international guidelines and rational use of antibiotics in urinary tract infections in a country without national guidance: a cross-sectional study [^11283MUr]. BMJ Open Quality (2024). High credibility.

Daily dose and duration conformity

When the drug choice was appropriate, dose conformity was generally high, ranging from 71% to 100% according to the diagnosis. This is similar to the 2018 Lebanese studyand could be explained by the fact that most drugs, like Fosfomycin, nitrofurantoin or ertapenem, have one standard dosing regimen; thus, errors are inexistent in that case. Dose conformity was lowest in simple cystitis, mainly driven by prescriptions of Ciprofloxacin and Levofloxacin. While they are recommended as the second-line ATBs at low doses (250 mg two times per day), they were prescribed in 100% of cases at a standard daily dose of 500 mg two times per day.

Duration conformity, which is the lowest of all three conformities, follows the same trend. In most cases, treatment durations were too long. Ciprofloxacin and Levofloxacin, which should be prescribed for 3 days only in simple cystitis, were given for up to 7–15 days in many cases; nitrofurantoin was given for 7 days instead of 5 in two-thirds of cases. One notable exception is cefixime, which, in almost all cases (21 of 25 prescriptions), was given for a total of 6 days instead of 7 days. On looking into the brands available in Lebanon, it appeared to us that the most common brand is sold in boxes of six pills. Because in Lebanon, drugs are sold to the patient in full boxes and not as an exact number of pills like in other countries, it seems that physicians take this point into account and prefer giving the drug for 1 day less, instead of letting the patient buy an additional box to use one additional pill only.

### Comparison of the effectiveness of single-dose levofloxacin with single-dose fosfomycin pre-urodynamic study related to the incidence of urinary tract infection: a randomized controlled trial [^116gh1FN]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of 500 mg levofloxacin and 3 g fosfomycin given as single-dose prophylactic antibiotics one hour before urodynamic studies (UDS) to prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs).

Methods

This single-blinded, randomized clinical trial included 126 patients who underwent UDS between December 2022 and March 2024 at two urology centers in Jakarta. The patients, aged 18 years and older, were randomized equally into two groups receiving either 500 mg levofloxacin or 3 g fosfomycin prior to UDS. The primary indications for UDS included lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) (54.8%), overactive bladder (OAB) (32.8%), underactive bladder (8.9%), and stress urinary incontinence (3.5%). Three days post-UDS, patients were followed up with urinalysis and clinical assessment for UTI symptoms.

Results

Among the 126 patients, UTI was diagnosed in 26 cases (20.9%), with 14 cases (22.2%) in the levofloxacin group and 12 cases (19%) in the fosfomycin group, showing no significant difference (p = 0.660). Symptomatic UTIs occurred in 6 patients (4.8%) in the levofloxacin group and 7 patients (5.6%) in the fosfomycin group. E. coli was the most commonly detected bacterium in urine cultures.

Conclusion

In our center, there was no significant difference in the clinical outcome between the administration of 3 g fosfomycin and 500 mg levofloxacin as single-dose prophylactic antibiotics prior to UDS. Given the rising antibiotic resistance, fosfomycin may be considered an alternative. Further multicenter and multinational studies are warranted, as bacterial profiles and antibiotic resistance patterns may vary across different regions and healthcare systems.

### Association of higher-dose fluoroquinolone therapy with serious adverse events in older adults with advanced chronic kidney disease [^1176e9cw]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Fluoroquinolones are among the most commonly prescribed broad-spectrum antibiotics worldwide. In the US, 6.7 million ciprofloxacin prescriptions and 3.8 million levofloxacin prescriptions were filled in 2018. Indications for these antibiotics include urinary tract infection, respiratory tract infection, gastrointestinal tract infection, and skin and soft tissue infection. Fluoroquinolone use is associated with a number of rare but serious adverse events including nervous system and/or psychiatric disorders (eg, hospitalization with delirium or peripheral neuropathy), hypoglycemia, and collagen-associated adverse events (eg, Achilles tendon rupture, abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture). These risks have been reported in population-based studies and meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials and observational studies. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued several black-box warnings about the risks of fluoroquinolone use. Given the potential for harm, fluoroquinolones are typically reserved to treat more severe bacterial infections in which the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.

Except for moxifloxacin, fluoroquinolones are primarily eliminated by the kidney, and excretion is therefore slower in patients with reduced kidney function. The product monograph and prescribing guidelines recommend that patients with reduced kidney function take fluoroquinolones at lower doses, particularly patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than 30 mL/min per 1.73 m² (eTable 1 in the Supplement). However, in practice, fluoroquinolones are frequently prescribed to these patients at higher than recommended doses. Adverse events associated with fluoroquinolone use in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have been reported in 30 case reports and in 1 cohort study of 264 968 patients receiving hemodialysis (a literature search and summary of studies are provided in eTables 2 and 3, respectively, in the Supplement).

### The association of antibiotic stewardship with fluoroquinolone prescribing in Michigan hospitals: a multi-hospital cohort study [^1163jQDP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Up to half of hospitalized patients receive antibiotics, most often for pneumonia or a urinary tract infection (UTI). Of these, 1 in 5 will develop an antibiotic-associated adverse event. In particular, fluoroquinolone antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin) are associated with severe adverse reactions and the development of antibiotic resistance. Regional rates of fluoroquinolone prescribing (defined daily doses) are highly correlated with regional rates of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). For example, the United Kingdom's decrease in C. difficile was likely driven by reduced fluoroquinolone prescribing. Although up to half of patients hospitalized with pneumonia or a UTI receive a fluoroquinolone, safer alternatives often exist.

To mitigate the risks related to fluoroquinolone use, antibiotic stewardship guidelines recommend that hospitals reduce fluoroquinolone prescribing. Specifically, 2 core stewardship interventions are strongly recommended: pre-prescription approval (ie, requiring approval prior to prescribing restricted antibiotics) and/or prospective audit and feedback (ie, providing feedback to providers after prescribing). Use of these core, hospital-based interventions to target fluoroquinolone prescribing in hospitals (ie, fluoroquinolone stewardship) has been shown to reduce inpatient fluoroquinolone prescribing. However, their effect on aggregate (inpatient and post-discharge) fluoroquinolone prescribing is unknown. Therefore, we evaluated the association of fluoroquinolone stewardship with aggregate fluoroquinolone use in patients hospitalized with pneumonia or a positive urine culture in a 48-hospital cohort study.

Subject characteristics

* UDS = urodynamic study; UTI = urinary tract infections

In a cohort of 126 patients who underwent UDS, UTI were diagnosed in 26 cases (20.9%) — 14 (22.2%) from the levofloxacin group and 12 (19%) from the fosfomycin group — indicating no significant difference in incidence rates between the two groups (p = 0.660). The absolute risk reduction (ARR) between the levofloxacin and fosfomycin groups was 3.2% (22.2% − 19%). The relative effect size, expressed as an odds ratio (OR), was 0.8 (95% CI: 0.4–1.95). Of those with UTI, 17 were male — 10 from the levofloxacin group and 7 from the fosfomycin group. Symptomatic UTIs were observed in six (4.8%) patients in the levofloxacin group and in seven (5.6%) patients in the fosfomycin group. The relative risk for symptomatic UTI was 1.17 (95% CI: 0.4–3.5), with an ARR of 0.8% (5.6% − 4.8%). No subgroup or adjusted analyses were performed as this was not pre-specified in the protocol. Harms and unintended effects were minimal in both groups. In the fosfomycin group, Three participants (4.76%) in the levofloxacin group reported mild nausea, which resolved without intervention. In the levofloxacin group, two participants (3.17%) reported mild nausea. No serious adverse events were observed during the study period. E. coli was the most frequently-identified bacterium in urine cultures, followed by K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. Additionally, 10 patients with UTI showed no bacterial growth in their urine culture/isolation. The comparison of UTI cases between both groups is described in Table 2.

### Rational antibiotic treatment of outpatient genitourinary infections in a changing environment [^115e4DU4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

In the outpatient setting, genitourinary infections (GUIs) remain costly to treat and are a significant cause of morbidity. Recent evidence supports more substantial roles for pathogens other than Escherichia coli, particularly gram-positive pathogens, in the pathogenesis of GUIs. Broad-spectrum agents should be considered in order to address this etiologic change appropriately. Criteria for antimicrobial selection set forth by the Council for Appropriate and Rational Antibiotic Therapy (CARAT) recommend using antibiotics that are supported by strong clinical evidence, have good susceptibility profiles, are safe, are cost-effective, and are used for the optimal duration. Evidence-based guidelines recommend considering local E coli resistance rates to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and using fluoroquinolones as second-line therapy when resistance is high. Fluoroquinolones are recommended for the treatment of pyelonephritis and prostatitis. Among the fluoroquinolones, levofloxacin and gatifloxacin offer coverage for the gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, which may make them preferable in treating urinary tract infections empirically in such patient groups. For the treatment of bacterial prostatitis, only trimethoprim and the fluoroquinolones possess both the appropriate bactericidal activity and the ability to diffuse into the prostate. Levofloxacin shows particularly good penetration into prostatic tissue. Safety issues to consider include imbalances in intestinal microflora caused by antimicrobial agents that may lead to overgrowth of vancomycin-resistant enterococci and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea. Once the optimal agent is identified, the optimal duration of treatment should be determined to maximize treatment success while minimizing the potential for resistance. Finally, cost considerations include the costs of treatment failure due to inappropriate therapy or nonadherence to the therapeutic regimen.

### Is more than one quinolone needed in clinical practice? [^115cWdFC]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To review clinical information on fluoroquinolone antimicrobials to distinguish between these agents and help define their place in clinical practice.

Data Sources

Primary and review articles on fluoroquinolones available commercially in the US as of August 2000 were identified through MEDLINE (from 1993-August 2000) and secondary sources.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All pertinent, published, clinical trials for levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and gatifloxacin were included. Minimal data were included for quinolones with restricted or limited uses, including trovafloxacin, sparfloxacin, enoxacin, and lomefloxacin. Due to the quantity of data on ciprofloxacin, only more recent or pivotal trials or articles summarizing data on specific infections were included. Relevant information was included if it was believed to assist in differentiating between the fluoroquinolones for infections for which these agents would most commonly be considered.

Data Synthesis

Fluoroquinolones are a potent class of intravenous and oral broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents used for treating a wide range of community-acquired and nosocomial infections. More than 10 quinolones have been approved for use; although some of these have been withdrawn from the market, numerous others are under investigation. It has become increasingly important to be able to differentiate between these agents.

Conclusions

Differences in safety, antimicrobial spectrum of activity, and resistance development support the selective use of various fluoroquinolones in differing clinical situations.

Outcome assessment

A urine test that shows leukocyturia (more than five white blood cells per field of vision), a positive result for bacteria, nitrite, and/or leukocyte esterase, or any combination of these, is used to diagnose a urinary tract infection. Urine cultures were taken from individuals who had been diagnosed with UTIs after the results of the urinalysis were obtained and the clinical symptoms had been evaluated.

The study employed descriptive statistics to assess various subject characteristics, including age, gender, and indication for urodynamic testing. To evaluate the association between treatment groups and the occurrence of UTI, chi-square analysis was used. Data were processed using SPSS version 24, and p < 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance.

A double-blind, randomized controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single dose of 500 mg of ciprofloxacin versus 3 days 400 mg twice-daily of norfloxacin in uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women was designed. Patients underwent four visits: baseline, and at 3, 7 and 28 days. The main efficacy variables were clinical and microbiological outcome at day 7. Analyses on both valid patients and intention-to-treat populations were performed. Two hundred and twenty-six patients (114 receiving ciprofloxacin and 112 receiving norfloxacin) were considered valid for efficacy evaluation. Bacteriologic cure was 91.2% in the ciprofloxacin group and 91.9% in the norfloxacin group. Clinical resolution was 91.2 and 93.8%, respectively. Both treatments were equally efficacious (P = 0.016).

The sample size was calculated based on a comparison of two independent proportions using the formula described in Fundamentals of Clinical Research Methodology. We assumed a 20% absolute difference in the incidence of post-UDS bacteriuria between groups receiving levofloxacin (P₁ = 0.7) and fosfomycin (P₂ = 0.9), with α = 0.05 and 80% power (Zα = 1.96; Zβ = 0.842). Based on this, the minimum sample size required was 62 patients per group. Anticipating a small dropout rate, the final total sample size was set at 126 participants (63 per arm).

The study has received institutional approval under Ethical Clearance number LB.02.01/VII.01/47,374/01/2023 issued by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia and under Ethical Clearance number 89/KEPK-RSUPP/05/2023 issued by the Ethics Committee of Health Research of Persahabatan Hospital.

### Comparison of the effectiveness of single-dose levofloxacin with single-dose fosfomycin pre-urodynamic study related to the incidence of urinary tract infection: a randomized controlled trial [^117Lcysn]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Administering a single dose of 500 mg of levofloxacin one hour prior to the UDS examination and a single dose of 3 g fosfomycin as prophylactic antibiotic do not significantly alter the clinical outcomes. Although the odds ratio (OR 0.8 ± 0.4–1.95) suggested a lower likelihood of UTI with fosfomycin administration (n = 12; 9.52%) compared to levofloxacin administration (n = 14; 11.38%), this difference was not statistically significant. The study also indicated that the fosfomycin group (n = 7; 5.56%) experienced more symptomatic post-UDS UTI compared to the levofloxacin group (n = 6; 4.76%). However, when urine cultures were performed, the fosfomycin group had fewer positive bacterial cultures compared to the levofloxacin group, albeit the difference being not statistically significant (p = 0.660). These findings contradict data reported by the Clinical Pathology Department of Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo National Referral Hospital, which indicated that fosfomycin has better sensitivity against E. coli isolates compared to levofloxacin. A study conducted by Fajfr et al. also showed that oral fosfomycin provided better outcomes than levofloxacin. Other studies have also suggested that fosfomycin is a non-inferior option to other antibiotics in patients with UTI. The results from this study are consistent with the findings of Wang et al. who observed no difference in clinical outcomes between single-dose fosfomycin and other types of antibiotics, including fluoroquinolones.

Levofloxacin tablet is indicated for inhalational anthrax (post-exposure) to reduce the incidence or progression of disease following exposure to aerosolized Bacillus anthracis in adults and pediatric patients, 6 months of age and older [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. The effectiveness of levofloxacin tablet is based on plasma concentrations achieved in humans, a surrogate endpoint reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. Levofloxacin tablet has not been tested in humans for the post-exposure prevention of inhalation anthrax. The safety of levofloxacin tablets in adults for durations of therapy beyond 28 days or in pediatric patients for durations of therapy beyond 14 days has not been studied. Prolonged levofloxacin tablets therapy should only be used when the benefit outweighs the risk [see Clinical Studies (14.9)].

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^117Smpys]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) antibiotic duration — In patients presenting with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) and who are improving clinically on effective therapy, we suggest treating with a shorter course of antimicrobials, using either 5–7 days of a fluoroquinolone (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence) or 7 days of a non-fluoroquinolone antibiotic (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence), rather than a longer course (10–14 days). An effective antimicrobial agent achieves therapeutic levels in the urine and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy. Most studies supporting this recommendation excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, severe sepsis, immunocompromising conditions, abscesses in the urinary tract, chronic kidney disease, bacterial prostatitis, complete urinary obstruction, or undergoing urologic surgical procedures. Some patients in these subpopulations may be at higher risk for complications or treatment failure and may need an individualized duration of therapy. Men with febrile UTI in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement.

### Bioavailability of two oral formulations of a single dose of levofloxacin 500 mg: an open-label, randomized, two-period crossover comparison in healthy Mexican volunteers [^114MAFMi]. Clinical Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Levofloxacin is a synthetic fluoroquinolone with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. It is indicated for the treatment of respiratory, sinus, skin, and urinary tract infections. Although generic formulations of oral levofloxacin are marketed in Mexico, a literature search did not identify published data concerning the bioavailability of these formulations; these data would be relevant to secure marketing of a test formulation in Mexico.

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare the bioavailability and determine the bioequivalence of a test formulation (an oral tablet containing levofloxacin 500 mg) with its corresponding listed reference-drug formulation in Mexico (a list issued by Mexican Health Authorities).

Methods

A single-dose, open-label, randomized-sequence, 2-period crossover design was used in this study. Eligible participants were healthy Mexican adults of either sex, randomly assigned to receive the test formulation followed by the corresponding reference formulation, or vice versa, with a 1-week washout period between doses. After a 10-hour overnight fast, the participants received the assigned formulation. Plasma concentrations of levofloxacin were determined using high-performance thin-layer chromatography, and densitometric analysis was performed at 300 nm. For the analysis of pharmacokinetic parameters, including C(max), AUC0(-24), and AUC(0-infinity)), blood samples were drawn at baseline and at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours after administration. The test formulation was considered to meet the criteria for bioequivalence if the geometric mean ratios (test/reference) were with- in the predetermined range of 80% to 125%. Tolerability was determined by clinical assessment, vital signs, laboratory analysis, and interviews with participants about adverse events.

Results

A total of 26 participants were enrolled, including 14 men and 12 women with a mean (SD) age of 24 (4) years (range, 18–34 years), weight of 62.2 (10.0) kg (range, 45.5–80.0 kg), height of 163 (9) cm (range, 148–176 cm), and body mass index of 23.3 (2.4) kg/m(2) (range, 19.2–27.1 kg/m(2)). The 90% CIs for log-transformed C(max), AUC(0–24), and AUC(0-infinity) were 94.48% to 106.22%, 90.01% to 116.44%, and 85.11% to 114.00%, respectively. Eleven participants reported a total of 20 adverse events during the study. None of the adverse events were considered serious.

Conclusions

In this small study in healthy, fasting Mexican adults, a single 500-mg dose of the test formulation of orally administered levofloxacin met the regulatory requirements to assume bioequivalence based on the rate and extent of absorption. Both formulations were well tolerated.

### Antimicrobial therapy for chronic bacterial prostatitis [^1169X3JR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP) is frequently diagnosed in men of fertile age, and is characterized by a disabling array of symptoms, including pain in the pelvic area (for example, perineum, testicles), voiding symptoms (increased frequency and urgency, also at night; pain or discomfort at micturition), and sexual dysfunction. Cure of CBP can be attempted by long-term therapy with antibacterial agents, but relapses are frequent. Few antibacterial agents are able to distribute to the prostatic tissue and achieve sufficient concentrations at the site of infection. These agents include fluoroquinolones, macrolides, tetracyclines and trimethoprim. After the introduction of fluoroquinolones into clinical practice, a number of studies have been performed to optimize the antimicrobial treatment of CBP, and to improve eradication rates and symptom relief.

Objectives

To assess and compare the efficacy and harm of antimicrobial treatments for chronic bacterial prostatitis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, other national or international databases and abstracts from conference proceedings on 8 August 2012.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomized controlled comparisons of one antimicrobial agent versus placebo or one or more comparator antimicrobial agents, combined or not with non-antimicrobial drugs. We also included trials comparing different doses, treatment durations, dosing frequencies, or routes of administration of antimicrobial agents. We excluded studies in which patients were not diagnosed according to internationally recommended criteria, or were not subjected to lower urinary tract segmented tests.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study data were extracted independently by two review authors. Study outcomes were microbiological efficacy (pathogen eradication), clinical efficacy (symptom cure or improvement, or symptom scores) at test-of-cure visits or at follow-up, or both, and adverse effects of therapy. Secondary outcomes included microbiological recurrence rates. Statistical analysis was performed using a fixed-effect model for microbiological outcomes and a random-effects model for clinical outcomes and adverse effects. The results were expressed as risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes (with 95% confidence intervals) or as standardized mean differences for continuous or non-dichotomous variables.

Main Results

We identified 18 studies, enrolling a total of 2196 randomized patients. The oral fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, lomefloxacin, ofloxacin and prulifloxacin were compared. There were no significant differences in clinical or microbiological efficacy or in the rate of adverse effects between these fluoroquinolones. In chlamydial prostatitis, (i) azithromycin showed improved eradication rates and clinical cure rates compared to ciprofloxacin, with no significant differences regarding adverse effects; (ii) azithromycin was equivalent to clarithromycin, both microbiologically and clinically; (iii) prulifloxacin appeared to improve clinical symptoms, but not eradication rates, compared to doxycycline. In ureaplasmal prostatitis, the comparisons ofloxacin versus minocycline and azithromycin versus doxycycline showed similar microbiological, clinical and toxicity profiles.

Authors' Conclusions

The microbiological and clinical efficacy, as well as the adverse effect profile, of different oral fluoroquinolones are comparable. No conclusions can be drawn regarding the optimal treatment duration of fluoroquinolones in the treatment of CBP caused by traditional pathogens. Alternative antimicrobial agents tested for the treatment of CBP caused by traditional pathogens are co-trimoxazole, beta-lactams and tetracyclines, but no conclusive evidence can be drawn regarding the role of non-fluoroquinolone antibiotics in the treatment of CBP caused by traditional pathogens. In patients with CBP caused by obligate intracellular pathogens, macrolides showed higher microbiological and clinical cure rates compared to fluoroquinolones.

We also advocate for proper patient counselling on the risks of serious adverse reactions to these antibiotics, including how to recognise the symptoms, to facilitate shared-decision making with patients.

### Comparison of the effectiveness of single-dose levofloxacin with single-dose fosfomycin pre-urodynamic study related to the incidence of urinary tract infection: a randomized controlled trial [^115c7V6k]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Regarding clinical indications for UDS, 69 patients (54.8%) had lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), 41 (32.8%) had overactive bladder (OAB), 11 (8.9%) had underactive bladder, and 5 (3.5%) had stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Distribution of these diagnoses between the treatment groups is detailed in Table 1. Based on chi-square analysis, there was no statistically significant difference in the distribution of clinical diagnoses between the fosfomycin and levofloxacin groups (p = 0.068). This indicates that randomization was generally adequate in balancing baseline clinical characteristics across both groups.

### Use of machine learning to assess the management of uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^112e6Ry3]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Up to 50% of women will experience a urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, making it the third most common indication for antibiotic treatment in the US after respiratory tract infection and skin and soft-tissue infections. Treatment guidelines published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in 2011 encouraged the use of nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fosfomycin as first-line treatments for uncomplicated UTI on the basis of their effectiveness and relatively limited adverse event profile. Fluoroquinolones are listed as an alternative option because of their predilection for selecting for multidrug-resistant organismsand their association with serious adverse events, including Clostridium difficile colitis. Despite this, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin are still the most commonly used antibiotics in the treatment of UTI, which may reflect the real or perceived threat of antibiotic resistance to the first-line agents. The guidelines list β-lactams as an inferior alternative because they are associated with reduced treatment effectiveness.

The evidence supporting the IDSA treatment guidelines is based on a small number of randomized clinical trials and observational studies, many of which were completed several decades ago. Although those studies provided important information for policymaking, they were limited in terms of the diversity of patients they recruited and were performed at a time when standards of care and health care–seeking behavior differed greatly from current practice. Furthermore, the pathogen strains in circulation at the time of these studies have likely been replaced by new strains that may have a differential response to drug therapies, regardless of their susceptibility phenotype. Therefore, a re-evaluation of management strategies for uncomplicated UTI could provide useful information for treating clinicians and policymakers. In this study, we sought to estimate treatment effectiveness and adverse events for guideline-concordant and guideline-discordant treatments for UTI using causal inference supported by machine learning applied to a large contemporary claims dataset.

INTRODUCTION

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are a commonly treated infection in the emergency department (ED), accounting for approximately 3 million visits annually, and 15% of all outpatient antibiotics in the United States (US). Enterobacterales remain the most common cause of UTIs and are associated with increased rates of in vitro resistance to commonly prescribed antibioitics. In particular, the prevalence of Escherichia coli resistance to commonly prescribed antibiotics such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), fluroquinolones (FQ; e.g. ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin), and beta‐lactams has continued to increase in most regions of the United States, and underscores the importance of using local antibiograms for selecting empiric treatment in patients diagnosed with a UTI in the ED.

Many geographic regions in the United States are reporting prevalences of FQ‐resistant (FQR) and TMP/SMX‐resistant Enterobacterales of > 10%, with some areas with rates > 20%, exceeding threshold rates (> 10%) recommended by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) to change from one antibiotic class to another for empirical treatment. Additionally, the prevalence of extended spectrum β‐lactamase (ESBL)‐producing Enterobacterales continues to increase, now exceeding 20% in some US locations.

Given a shrinking armamentarium of effective antibiotic treatment for UTIs, the IDSA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have identified the need for continued surveillance of resistance patterns at the local and national health care system level as a top priority to best inform antibiotic treatment decisions. In 2019, the CDC classified ESBL‐producing Enterobacterales as a serious threat due to the increase in community infections.ESBL‐producing Enterobacterales are oftentimes also resistant to FQ as well as other agents commonly used to treat UTIs. As antimicrobial resistance can change rapidly, surveillance and reporting of the prevalence of E.coli resistant and ESBL‐producing uropathogens is necessary to guide empiric antimicrobial treatment. The objective of our study was to determine the prevalence of FQ resistance among patients presenting to the ED and diagnosed with a UTI among a geographically diverse group of US sites. Secondary objectives were to identify geographic variation in E. coli resistance and risk factors associated with antimicrobial resistance.

### Llevofloxacin (levofloxacin) [^112eAVLe]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

1.11 Acute Pyelonephritis: 5 or 10-day Treatment Regimen

Levofloxacin tablet is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of acute pyelonephritis caused by Escherichia coli, including cases with concurrent bacteremia [see Clinical Studies (14.7, 14.8)].

1.12 Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections

Levofloxacin tabletis indicated in adult patients for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (mild to moderate) due to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Staphylococcus saprophyticus.

Because fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, have been associated with serious adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5)] and for some patients uncomplicated urinary tract infection is self-limiting, reserve levofloxacin for treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in patients who have no alternative treatment options.

1.13 Acute Bacterial Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis

Levofloxacin tablet is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (ABECB) due to methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis.

Because fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, have been associated with serious adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5)] and for some patients ABECB is self-limiting, reserve levofloxacin for treatment of ABECB in patients who have no alternative treatment options.

1.14 Acute Bacterial Sinusitis: 5-day and 10 to14 day Treatment Regimens

Levofloxacin tablet is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].

Because fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, have been associated with serious adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5)] and for some patients ABS is self-limiting, reserve levofloxacin for treatment of ABS in patients who have no alternative treatment options.

### The use of systemic and topical fluoroquinolones [^116YB1iq]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

The Use of Systemic and Topical Fluoroquinolones — selection, adult boxed warnings, pediatric musculoskeletal safety, and counseling — is summarized as follows: Fluoroquinolones may represent a preferred option or an acceptable alternative to standard therapy (for example, topical fluoroquinolones in the treatment of tympanostomy tube–associated otorrhea), and practitioners should be aware that both ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin are costly. In July 2016 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) added a safety announcement with updated box warnings restricting use of fluoroquinolone antibiotics in adults with acute sinusitis, acute bronchitis, and uncomplicated UTI to situations in which no other alternative treatment is available. No compelling published evidence to date supports sustained injury to developing bones or joints in children treated with available fluoroquinolone agents; however, FDA analysis of ciprofloxacin safety data suggests the possibility of increased musculoskeletal adverse events. In children treated with levofloxacin, both immediately after treatment and at a 12-month follow-up there was an increased rate of musculoskeletal complaints but no physical evidence of joint findings, and 5 years after treatment, no differences were seen between levofloxacin-treated and comparator-treated children. When prescribing, clinicians should verbally review common, anticipated, potential adverse events, such as rash, diarrhea, and potential musculoskeletal or neurologic events, and indicate why a fluoroquinolone is the most appropriate antibiotic agent for a child's infection.

### Interpretable machine learning-based decision support for prediction of antibiotic resistance for complicated urinary tract infections [^1152CTLw]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2023). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections are one of the most common bacterial infections worldwide; however, increasing antimicrobial resistance in bacterial pathogens is making it challenging for clinicians to correctly prescribe patients appropriate antibiotics. In this study, we present four interpretable machine learning-based decision support algorithms for predicting antimicrobial resistance. Using electronic health record data from a large cohort of patients diagnosed with potentially complicated UTIs, we demonstrate high predictability of antibiotic resistance across four antibiotics – nitrofurantoin, co-trimoxazole, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin. We additionally demonstrate the generalizability of our methods on a separate cohort of patients with uncomplicated UTIs, demonstrating that machine learning-driven approaches can help alleviate the potential of administering non-susceptible treatments, facilitate rapid effective clinical interventions, and enable personalized treatment suggestions. Additionally, these techniques present the benefit of providing model interpretability, explaining the basis for generated predictions.

### Association between aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection with fluoroquinolones use in patients with urinary tract infections: a population-based cohort study [^113huh7t]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs), including cystitis and pyelonephritis, are the most common outpatient infections worldwide. The prevalence of UTIs increases with age, and UTIs are predominant in women. The overall prevalence of UTIs in women was approximately 11%, and it increased to approximately 20% in women aged over age 65 years and 20% to 30% in women with multiple UTI recurrences. In addition, UTIs account for a higher number of infections (> 560 000) than other hospital‐acquired infections, with an estimated mortality rate of 2.3%; this rate can increase to 26% in the presence of bacteremia or septic shock.

According to the European Association of Urology guidelines on urological infections, UTIs can be classified into uncomplicated and complicated types according to sex, anatomical and functional abnormalities, and comorbidities. The antimicrobials cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones are recommended for disease management because of their high oral bioavailability and broad spectrum, and because of the susceptibility of causative pathogens to these antibiotics. Fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin, have been widely used to treat various infections ranging from respiratory infections to UTIs. The European Association of Urology guidelines recommend the use of first‐ or second‐generation cephalosporins for uncomplicated cystitis and recurrent UTIs. For uncomplicated pyelonephritis, fluoroquinolones and third‐generation cephalosporins are recommended, with both antibiotics administered through oral and intravenous routes. For complicated UTIs, fluoroquinolones can be prescribed to patients with less‐severe symptoms, and third‐generation cephalosporins can be prescribed to patients with systemic symptoms.

### Interpretable machine learning-based decision support for prediction of antibiotic resistance for complicated urinary tract infections [^111uFqBs]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2023). Medium credibility.

Recent studies have shown that ML-based algorithms, using electronic health record (EHR) data, including demographic information, prior antibiotic exposures, prior microbiology antibiotic susceptibility data, basic laboratory values, and comorbidities, can be used to predict antibiotic resistance in UTI infections. Analyzing six different antibiotics, Yelin et al.demonstrated that logistic regression and gradient-boosting decision trees could effectively improve the predictability of resistance (AUROC range 0.70–0.83), using demographics, microbiology sample history and antibiotic purchase history. Subsequently, they also found that the algorithm-suggested drug recommendations reduced the rate of mismatched treatments, both when using an unconstrained method (where the antibiotic with the lowest resistance probability was chosen) and a constrained method (where antibiotics were selected at the same frequency used by clinicians). Although past purchase history was shown to have high predictive power, past antibiotic purchases and treatment can be associated with different clinical conditions including comorbities and hospitalizations, which were not considered in the study. Similarly, Kanjilal et al.used EHR data to predict the probability of antibiotic resistance for uncomplicated UTIs. They performed retrospective analyses on a subset of patients with uncomplicated UTI, consisting of 15,806 specimens. This uncomplicated cohort was defined as specimens where the infection site was specified as urinary, and the following patient criteria were met: female between the ages of 18 to 55, no diagnosis indicating pregnancy in the past 90 days, no selected procedure (placement of a central venous catheter, mechanical ventilation, parenteral nutrition, hemodialysis, and any surgical procedure) in the past 90 days, no indication of pyelonephritis, and exactly one antibiotic of nitrofurantoin, co-trimoxazole, levofloxacin, or ciprofloxacin prescribed). The trained models achieved AUROCs between 0.56–0.64 across four different antibiotics. Despite relatively modest predictive performance, this still out-performed clinicians. In addition to predicting resistance, they also aimed to reduce the recommendation of broad-spectrum second-line therapies (e.g. fluoroquinolone antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, which have also been associated with serious adverse events in some patients). Using logistic regression and post-processing analysis, they found that their pipeline both reduced inappropriate antibiotic recommendations and achieved a 67% reduction in the recommendation of second-line agents, relative to clinicians. Although these studies found that logistic regression and gradient-boosting trees achieved the best results, neither investigated the effectiveness of neural network-based architectures.

### Maintaining fluoroquinolone class efficacy: review of influencing factors [^1115Cssm]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The fluoroquinolone class of antimicrobial agents is being increasingly used empirically as resistance has developed to the more traditional antimicrobial agents. Guidelines now recommend fluoroquinolones as first-line empiric therapy for urinary tract infections in regions were trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole resistance is > 10% to 20%, and fluoroquinolones are recommended as alternative empiric regimens in some patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Though increased use of these agents would be expected to lead to increased resistance, a targeted approach to fluoroquinolone prescribing, emphasizing their appropriate use, may reduce development of antimicrobial resistance and maintain class efficacy.

Evidence is mounting that suggests a link between inappropriate fluoroquinolone use, development of antimicrobial resistance against the entire fluoroquinolone class, and clinical failure. To maintain the activity of the fluoroquinolone class, clinicians need to implement an evidence-based approach to antimicrobial selection, particularly a strategy in which the most pharmacodynamically potent fluoroquinolone is matched, on an empiric basis when required, to anticipated bacterial pathogens.

Three major factors are associated with increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones: 1) underdosing, i.e. use of a marginally potent agent whose MIC is barely reached in serum or infected tissues; 2) overuse of agents known to encourage resistant mutants; and 3) the inability to readily detect and respond to changes in antimicrobial susceptibilities. Traditional reporting of susceptibility data may be misleading and may not readily identify initial changes in resistance patterns or differences between agents of the same class.

To preserve fluoroquinolone activity, the activity of these agents must be continually assessed, and these agents must be used appropriately. The individual attributes of a given drug should be matched with the likely pathogen at specific infective sites. Expecting a single fluoroquinolone to be suitable for all infections is unreasonable, and excessive use of any single fluoroquinolone for all indications will lead to resistance that will adversely affect the entire class.

### Single dose levofloxacin prophylaxis for prostate biopsy in patients at low risk [^114EqdgS]. The Journal of Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

We determine if a single 500 mg. oral tablet of levofloxacin represents adequate prophylaxis for patients at low risk who undergo transrectal prostate biopsy.

Materials and Methods

From April 2000 to May 2001 we prospectively evaluated 400 consecutive men who underwent transrectal needle biopsy of the prostate after a single 500 mg. oral dose of levofloxacin. Under an institutional review board approved protocol the drug was issued under a standing order by a clinic nurse 30 to 60 minutes before the procedure. Patients were issued 2 additional daily doses of levofloxacin if they were deemed at increased risk for infectious complications, that is if they had a large prostate more than 75 cc, diabetes mellitus, recent steroid use, severe voiding dysfunction or immune compromise. No patient received a cleansing enema before the procedure. Complications, the number of biopsy cores, prostate size and cancer detection rates were assessed.

Results

Only 1 of the 377 patients at low risk in whom biopsy was completed experienced a symptomatic urinary tract infection (0.27%). None of the 23 men at high risk who received additional doses of levofloxacin experienced a complication. Thus, the overall infection rate was 1 of 400 cases (0.25%) in this series. A mean of 7 biopsy cores (range 2 to 16) was obtained per patient and mean prostate volume was 49.75 cc (range 12 to 150). Prostate cancer was present in 93 patients (23%).

Conclusions

A single 500 mg. dose of levofloxacin before transrectal needle biopsy of the prostate is effective and safe in patients at low risk. The administration of prophylaxis by a clinic nurse under a standing order optimizes patient compliance and physician efficiency. In patients at higher risk for infection additional antibiotic administration appears to provide adequate prophylaxis.

### Use of machine learning to assess the management of uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^11166m3B]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common indication for outpatient antimicrobial therapy. National guidelines for the management of uncomplicated UTI were published in 2011, but the extent to which they align with current practices, patient diversity, and pathogen biology, all of which have evolved greatly in the time since their publication, is not fully known.

Objective

To reevaluate the effectiveness and adverse event profile for first-line antibiotics, fluoroquinolones, and oral β-lactams for treating uncomplicated UTI in contemporary clinical practice.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective, population-based cohort study used a claims dataset from Independence Blue Cross, which contains inpatient, outpatient, laboratory, and pharmacy claims that occurred between 2012 and 2021, formatted into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model. Participants were nonpregnant female individuals aged 18 years or older with a diagnosis of uncomplicated, nonrecurrent UTI at an outpatient setting. Patients must also have been treated with first-line (nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or ofloxacin), or oral β-lactam (amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefadroxil, or cefpodoxime) antibiotics. Data analysis was performed from November 2021 to August 2024.

Exposures

Patients exposed to first-line antibiotics were assigned to the treatment group, and those exposed to fluoroquinolone or β-lactam treatments were assigned to control groups.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was a composite end point for treatment failure, defined as outpatient or inpatient revisit within 30 days for UTI, pyelonephritis, or sepsis. Secondary outcomes were the risk of 4 common antibiotic-associated adverse events: gastrointestinal symptoms, rash, kidney injury, and Clostridium difficile infection.

Results

There were 57 585 episodes of UTI among 49 037 female patients (mean [SD] age, 51.7 [20.1]) years), with prescriptions for first-line antibiotics in 35 018 episodes (61%), fluoroquinolones in 21 140 episodes (37%), and β-lactams in 1427 episodes (2%). After adjustment, receipt of first-line therapies was associated with an absolute risk difference of -1.78% (95% CI, -2.37% to -1.06%) for having a revisit for UTI within 30 days of diagnosis vs fluoroquinolones. First-line therapies were associated with an absolute risk difference of -6.40% (95% CI, -10.14% to -3.24%) for 30-day revisit compared with β-lactam antibiotics. Differences in adverse events were similar between all comparators. Results were identical for models built with an automated OMOP feature extraction package.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study of patients with uncomplicated UTI derived from a large regional claims dataset, national treatment guidelines published almost 14 years ago continue to recommend optimal treatments. These results also provide proof-of-principle that automated feature extraction methods for OMOP formatted data can emulate manually curated models, thereby promoting reproducibility and generalizability.

### Cefaclor as a first-line treatment for acute uncomplicated cystitis: a retrospective single-center study [^115AMf3E]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most frequently reported infections, and acute uncomplicated cystitis (AUC) is the most common presentation of UTIs. Approximately 50% of women will experience at least one UTI during their lifetime, and 25% will have recurrent infections. Given that successive or newer generations of antibiotics tend to have increased activity against Gram-negative bacilli, and wide-spectrum antibiotics have been favored for a long time, AUC drives antibiotic use around the world, leading to the increasing antimicrobial resistance of bacterial pathogens.

In Japan, fluoroquinolones have been widely introduced as the treatment for AUC, because levofloxacin (LVFX) was recommended as the first-line therapy for pre-menopausal women and as the second-line treatment for the menopausal women according to the Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases and Japanese Society of Chemotherapy guidelines 2015 (JAID/JSC). However, f luoroquinolone resistance among uropathogens such as Enterobacteriaceae is particularly problematic. Although the rates of the drug resistance among Enterobacteriaceae in the community had remained low at < 1% for decades, the rate has skyrocketed in recent years, ranging from 10 to 30% in developed countries. Additionally, the American Urological Association is strengthening the current warnings that fluoroquinolone antibiotics should be avoided for the treatment of AUC due to significant decreases in blood sugar and certain mental health side effects.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Proquin XR is indicated only for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (acute cystitis) caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms listed below. Proquin XR is not interchangeable with other ciprofloxacin extended-release or immediate release oral formulations. See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for specific recommendations.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (acute cystitis) caused by Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae.

THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF PROQUIN XR IN TREATING PYELONEPHRITIS, COMPLICATED URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS, AND INFECTIONS OTHER THAN UNCOMPLICATED URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS HAVE NOT BEEN DEMONSTRATED. Alternative therapy should be considered for patients who remain symptomatic or develop fever and back pain while on treatment with Proquin XR.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Proquin XR and other antibacterial drugs, Proquin XR should only be used to treat uncomplicated urinary tract infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and sensitivity information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Patient-initiated treatment of uncomplicated recurrent urinary tract infections in young women [^113YYjsp]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common outpatient problem, resulting in frequent office visits and often requiring the use of prophylactic antimicrobial agents. Patient-initiated treatment of recurrent UTIs may decrease antimicrobial use and improve patient convenience.

Objective

To determine the safety and feasibility of patient-initiated treatment of recurrent UTIs.

Design

Uncontrolled, prospective clinical trial.

Setting

University-based primary health care clinic.

Participants

Women at least 18 years of age with a history of recurrent UTIs and no recent pregnancy, hypertension, diabetes, or renal disease.

Intervention

After self-diagnosing UTI on the basis of symptoms, participating women initiated therapy with ofloxacin or levofloxacin.

Measurements

Accuracy of self-diagnosis determined by evidence of a definite (culture-positive) or probable (sterile pyuria and no alternative diagnosis) UTI on pretherapy urinalysis and culture. Women with a self-diagnosis of UTI that was not microbiologically confirmed were evaluated for alternative diagnoses. Post-therapy interviews and urine cultures were used to assess clinical and microbiological cure rates, adverse events, and patient satisfaction.

Results

88 of 172 women self-diagnosed a total of 172 UTIs. Laboratory evaluation showed a uropathogen in 144 cases (84%), sterile pyuria in 19 cases (11%), and no pyuria or bacteriuria in 9 cases (5%). Clinical and microbiological cures occurred in 92% and 96%, respectively, of culture-confirmed episodes. No serious adverse events occurred.

Conclusion

Adherent women can accurately self-diagnose and self-treat recurrent UTIs.

First-line antibiotics include nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals 100 mg BID × 5 d with the note to "Avoid if early pyelonephritis suspected", trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 160/800 mg BID × 3 d with the caution to "Avoid if resistance prevalence known to be > 20%", and fosfomycin trometamol 3 g single dose. Second-line antibiotics list fluoroquinolones with "Dose varies by regimen; typically 3-d regimen" and β-lactams with "Dose varies by regimen; typically for 3–7 d", and the table specifies, "Do not use ampicillin or amoxicillin for empirical treatment". Self-initiated regimens mirror these doses: nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals 100 mg BID × 5 d, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 160 mg/800 mg BID × 3 d, and fosfomycin trometamol 3 g.
