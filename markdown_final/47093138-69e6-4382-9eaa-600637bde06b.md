## Question

Causes of chronic leukocytosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of chronic leukocytosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining chronic leukocytosis and anchoring the diagnostic threshold. Then, I should categorize etiologies into reactive versus clonal, and within clonal, myeloid versus lymphoid. Next, I will detail each major category with exemplars and distinguishing features, followed by a practical diagnostic algorithm and management implications, including when to use cytoreduction and when to treat the underlying cause. Finally, I should verify edge cases and pitfalls, such as steroid-induced leukocytosis, leukemoid reactions, and pseudohyperkalemia in hyperleukocytosis, to ensure clinical safety and completeness.

> Let me first confirm the definition and scope. Chronic leukocytosis is best conceptualized as a sustained elevation of the white blood cell count beyond age-appropriate norms for at least several weeks to months, typically exceeding 11,000/mcL in adults, with the caveat that normal ranges vary by age and pregnancy status, so I need to ensure I interpret counts in the correct clinical context before proceeding further.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should categorize the causes before listing them. The two major buckets are reactive (secondary) leukocytosis, driven by external stimuli such as infection, inflammation, stress, drugs, or asplenia, and clonal (primary) hematologic disorders, which are intrinsic stem cell or lineage-restricted neoplasms; within clonal disease, I will separate myeloid neoplasms from lymphoid neoplasms because their peripheral patterns and diagnostic criteria differ meaningfully [^111SMYdS] [^111xbocB].

> I will now examine reactive causes, starting with chronic infections and inflammatory states. Chronic bacterial infections like tuberculosis, endocarditis, and chronic abscesses can sustain neutrophilia, while viral infections such as HIV, hepatitis, and EBV may drive lymphocytosis. Autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus, and inflammatory bowel disease also perpetuate leukocytosis via cytokine signaling, so I should actively look for these drivers when the smear shows toxic changes or a left shift without blasts [^112ow8Tj] [^113D73zb].

> Wait, let me verify medication and stress-related contributors. Glucocorticoids cause demargination and release of neutrophils from marrow pools, with typical increases of roughly 2–5 × 10⁹/L peaking around 48 hours depending on dose; high-dose regimens can raise counts by about 4–5 × 10⁹/L, so an unexpected magnitude or timing should prompt me to reconsider infection or another process rather than attributing it solely to steroids [^1164RvGb] [^111314sy] [^1177eRqN]. Chronic psychosocial stress can also activate hematopoietic stem cells via sympathetic signaling and lower CXCL12, increasing myeloid output and contributing to sustained neutrophilia, which I should keep in mind in patients with high stress burdens and no other obvious trigger [^115wYg3J].

> I need to check for asplenia and obesity as well. Functional or surgical asplenia removes a major marginal pool, producing a persistent lymphocytosis, while obesity and metabolic syndrome sustain low-grade inflammation that elevates myelopoiesis. Importantly, regular physical activity can reverse this myeloid skewing by modulating leptin and bone marrow niche signals, so lifestyle context matters when I interpret chronic leukocytosis in metabolic patients [^114QKP5w] [^1152bEE6].

> Next, I should review clonal myeloid neoplasms, starting with chronic myeloid leukemia. CML typically shows a neutrophil-predominant leukocytosis with left shift, basophilia, and sometimes eosinophilia; diagnosis hinges on demonstrating BCR-ABL1 by cytogenetics or PCR, and the blood smear often reveals a full myeloid spectrum from blasts to mature neutrophils, which helps distinguish it from reactive states and other MPNs [^116tCU6H] [^1144EjWL] [^116CpW1z].

> Let me consider chronic neutrophilic leukemia carefully. CNL is defined by persistent mature neutrophilia ≥ 25 × 10⁹/L with > 80% neutrophils, minimal immature forms, and absence of BCR-ABL1. The WHO incorporates activating CSF3R mutations as a central diagnostic feature, so I should send CSF3R sequencing when CNL is suspected, and remember that CNL lacks basophilia and shows a high leukocyte alkaline phosphatase, which helps differentiate it from CML and reactive neutrophilias [^111SMYdS] [^115kwAm1] [^115EvQTV].

> I should double-check chronic myelomonocytic leukemia next. CMML presents with sustained monocytosis ≥ 1 × 10⁹/L and ≥ 10% monocytes, often accompanied by dysplasia and a myeloproliferative phenotype; driver mutations such as SRSF2, TET2, and ASXL1 are common but not specific, so I must exclude reactive monocytosis and other myeloid neoplasms before confirming CMML, and I should remember that proliferative CMML with high WBC can cause lysozyme nephropathy, which is a clue to clonal monocytosis of renal significance [^111aGcdv] [^115jwtrh] [^1149Bnuk].

> But wait, what if the leukocytosis is extreme and the patient is unstable. Hyperleukocytosis and leukostasis are emergencies most often in AML but also occur in CML and other leukemias; symptoms include dyspnea, altered mentation, visual changes, and priapism, and urgent cytoreduction with hydroxyurea and consideration of leukapheresis are indicated while definitive therapy is arranged, so I should not delay escalation when clinical leukostasis is suspected [^111NWt4g] [^116Pqybc] [^116yzYWE].

> I will now examine lymphoid neoplasms, starting with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. CLL is defined by ≥ 5 × 10⁹/L clonal B cells coexpressing CD5, CD19, CD20(dim), and CD23; many cases are preceded by monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis, and importantly, absolute lymphocyte count alone is not an indication to treat in the absence of symptoms, cytopenias, bulky disease, or rapid progression, so I should avoid over-treating based on ALC alone [^112Bw3xj] [^112bdAsG] [^114cbHm9].

> Hold on, I should verify treatment triggers and special forms. iwCLL and NCCN emphasize treating for progressive marrow failure, symptomatic organomegaly, autoimmune cytopenias, or disease-related symptoms, and they caution that isolated lymphocyte rises should not trigger therapy; accelerated CLL with expanded proliferation centers or increased prolymphocytes signals more aggressive biology but is not Richter transformation, which I need to distinguish on morphology and clinical course [^1117ubjx] [^111bgC4u] [^116dpR3Z].

> Let me consider other lymphoid causes briefly. Hairy cell leukemia and other indolent B-cell lymphomas can present with lymphocytosis, and in children, pertussis and other viral infections can cause striking lymphocytosis. In adults, persistent lymphocytosis warrants flow cytometry to define clonality and subtype before labeling it benign [^113kneFH] [^111xbocB].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach so I do not miss a reversible cause. I need a careful history for infection, autoimmunity, medications, smoking, and stress; a focused exam for lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and signs of inflammation; and a repeat CBC with manual differential and smear to assess morphology, left shift, toxic changes, blasts, basophilia, and dysplasia; if WBC exceeds about 20,000/mcL or there are cytopenias or organomegaly, I should obtain a peripheral smear and consider bone marrow evaluation with cytogenetics and molecular testing, including BCR-ABL1, CSF3R, JAK2/CALR/MPL, and targeted panels for CMML and other MPNs [^114QKP5w] [^1113Q9nd] [^113Y9xBJ].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overlooked leukemoid reactions. A leukemoid reaction is a reactive neutrophilia often exceeding 50,000/mcL with toxic granulation and Döhle bodies, high LAP, and no blasts. It can be triggered by severe infection, tissue necrosis, or cytokine-secreting tumors, and distinguishing it from CML or CNL requires BCR-ABL1 testing, CSF3R sequencing, and clinical correlation. If the leukocytosis persists after the trigger resolves, I should re-evaluate for an occult malignancy or clonal process [^116uGvRE] [^111SMYdS].

> I should confirm management principles next. For reactive leukocytosis, treat the underlying cause and remove the stimulus. For clonal disease, disease-directed therapy is key, with cytoreduction as a bridge when counts are very high or there is leukostasis risk. In CML, hydroxyurea is preferred to rapidly lower WBC until TKI therapy begins, and leukapheresis is reserved for select high-risk presentations such as neurologic symptoms, respiratory compromise, or priapism, while in CLL, observation is appropriate until iwCLL criteria are met, and in CMML, hydroxyurea can be used for proliferative features and symptomatic cytopenias while definitive therapy is planned [^111FqwDw] [^116yzYWE] [^114cbHm9] [^111aGcdv].

> Hold on, I should verify a common pitfall in hyperleukocytosis. Severe leukocytosis can cause spurious hyperkalemia due to potassium release from fragile leukocytes during clotting; if I encounter marked hyperkalemia in this setting, I should confirm with whole-blood or plasma methods before treating, to avoid iatrogenic hypokalemia from unwarranted interventions [^117QSbyY].

> Let me reconsider the overarching framework to ensure internal consistency. Chronic leukocytosis arises either from persistent external stimulation of normal hematopoiesis or from autonomous clonal proliferation; distinguishing these requires integrating clinical context, smear morphology, and molecular testing, and the threshold to escalate to marrow and genetics should be lower when counts are very high, cytopenias coexist, organomegaly is present, or the course is progressive, as these features increase the likelihood of a clonal myeloid or lymphoid neoplasm [^113Y9xBJ] [^114QKP5w].

Chronic leukocytosis is a sustained elevation of the white blood cell count, typically > 11,000/µL for more than 3 months. The most common causes are **chronic infections** (tuberculosis, HIV, hepatitis, endocarditis), **autoimmune/inflammatory diseases** (rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, IBD), and **hematologic malignancies** (CML, CLL, CMML, CNL) [^114QKP5w] [^1113Q9nd]. Other causes include medications (glucocorticoids, lithium, G-CSF), smoking, obesity, asplenia, and chronic stress [^114QKP5w] [^115wYg3J]. Evaluation should include a **CBC with differential**, peripheral smear, and targeted labs (BCR-ABL1, JAK2/CALR/MPL, CSF3R, flow cytometry) [^113Y9xBJ] [^111SMYdS]; bone marrow biopsy is indicated if malignancy is suspected or the cause remains unclear [^113Y9xBJ]. Management focuses on treating the underlying cause, with cytoreduction (hydroxyurea, leukapheresis) for very high counts or leukostasis risk [^111FqwDw] [^111NWt4g].

---

## Infectious causes

Chronic infections are a major cause of persistent leukocytosis, including:

- **Tuberculosis**: Chronic granulomatous infection causing sustained neutrophilia or lymphocytosis [^113kneFH].
- **HIV/AIDS**: Chronic viral infection with immune dysregulation and secondary infections.
- **Hepatitis B and C**: Chronic viral hepatitis with persistent immune activation.
- **Endocarditis**: Chronic bacterial infection of heart valves causing sustained neutrophilia [^notfound].

---

## Inflammatory and autoimmune diseases

Chronic inflammatory and autoimmune conditions can cause persistent leukocytosis via cytokine-driven myelopoiesis [^1119skRL]:

- **Rheumatoid arthritis**: Chronic inflammation with elevated neutrophils.
- **Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)**: Autoimmune inflammation with leukocytosis.
- **Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)**: Chronic gut inflammation with sustained leukocytosis [^114QKP5w].

---

## Hematologic malignancies

Several hematologic malignancies present with chronic leukocytosis, including:

| **Malignancy** | **Characteristic features** |
|-|-|
| Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) | - BCR-ABL1 fusion gene <br/> - Neutrophilia with left shift <br/> - Basophilia <br/> - Splenomegaly [^1144EjWL] [^116tCU6H] |
| Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) | - Clonal B-cell lymphocytosis <br/> - Lymphadenopathy <br/> - Splenomegaly [^112Bw3xj] [^111bgC4u] |
| Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) | - Persistent monocytosis <br/> - Dysplasia <br/> - Myeloproliferative features [^1149Bnuk] [^115jwtrh] |
| Chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) | - CSF3R mutations <br/> - Sustained neutrophilia <br/> - Splenomegaly [^111SMYdS] [^11536kLr] |

---

## Medications and substances

Certain medications and substances can cause chronic leukocytosis:

- **Glucocorticoids**: Demargination and increased myelopoiesis; typical rise 2–5 × 10⁹/L within 48 hours [^1164RvGb] [^111314sy].
- **Lithium**: Stimulates granulopoiesis, causing neutrophilia.
- **Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)**: Directly increases neutrophil production [^116uGvRE].
- **Smoking**: Chronic inflammation with sustained neutrophilia [^notfound].

---

## Physiological and lifestyle factors

Physiological and lifestyle factors can contribute to chronic leukocytosis, including **obesity** — chronic low-grade inflammation increases myelopoiesis [^1152bEE6] — and **chronic stress**, which activates hematopoietic stem cells and increases leukocyte production [^115wYg3J]. Asplenia results in a **loss of splenic sequestration** and causes persistent leukocytosis [^114QKP5w].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **systematic diagnostic approach** is essential:

- **Confirm leukocytosis**: Repeat CBC with differential to confirm persistence [^114QKP5w].
- **Peripheral smear**: Assess morphology, left shift, blasts, dysplasia [^111xbocB].
- **Laboratory tests**: BCR-ABL1, JAK2/CALR/MPL, CSF3R, flow cytometry [^114ieGNV].
- **Bone marrow biopsy**: Indicated if malignancy suspected or cause unclear [^113Y9xBJ].

---

## Management strategies

Management focuses on the **underlying cause**:

- **Treat underlying condition**: Antibiotics for infection, immunosuppression for autoimmune disease, targeted therapy for malignancy [^116uGvRE].
- **Cytoreduction**: Hydroxyurea or leukapheresis for very high counts or leukostasis risk [^111FqwDw] [^111NWt4g].
- **Supportive care**: Manage complications (e.g. infections, thrombosis) [^111NWt4g].

---

Chronic leukocytosis reflects diverse infectious, inflammatory, malignant, drug-related, and physiological causes; **targeted evaluation and cause-specific therapy** are key to management.

### Highly similar genomic landscapes in monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis and ultra-stable chronic lymphocytic leukemia with low frequency of driver mutations [^116bjxPG]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Despite the recent discovery of recurrent driver mutations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the genetic factors involved in disease onset remain largely unknown. To address this issue, we performed whole-genome sequencing in 11 individuals with monoclonal B- cell lymphocytosis, both of the low-count and high-count subtypes, and 5 patients with ultra-stable chronic lymphocytic leukemia (> 10 years without progression from initial diagnosis). All three entities were indistinguishable at the genomic level exhibiting low genomic complexity and similar types of somatic mutations. Exonic mutations were not frequently identified in putative chronic lymphocytic leukemia driver genes in all settings, including low-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis. To corroborate these findings, we also performed deep sequencing in 11 known frequently mutated genes in an extended cohort of 28 monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis/chronic lymphocytic leukemia cases. Interestingly, shared mutations were detected between clonal B cells and paired polymorphonuclear cells, strengthening the notion that at least a fraction of somatic mutations may occur before disease onset, likely at the hematopoietic stem cell level. Finally, we identified previously unreported non-coding variants targeting pathways relevant to B-cell and chronic lymphocytic leukemia development, likely associated with the acquisition of the characteristic neoplastic phenotype typical of both monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

Regarding medical management for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, more specifically with respect to indications for treatment, iwCLL 2018 guidelines recommend to avoid restarting therapy on the basis of disease relapse alone unless the disease is symptomatic. Avoid restarting therapy on the basis of asymptomatic increases of lymphocyte counts alone without other signs of progression. Follow the same indications for second- and subsequent-line treatment decisions as those used for first-line treatment.

### Chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL): a clinical, pathologic and cytogenetic study [^113Ucye1]. Leukemia (2001). Low credibility.

This report describes a single institution's recent experience with six patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of chronic neutrophilic leukemia. No patient had the Philadelphia chromosome or the BCR/ABL fusion gene. None of the common cytogenetic abnormalities characteristic of myeloid disorders were detected. Two patients demonstrated clonal evolution during the course of the disease. All responded initially to therapy with hydroxyurea with control of leukocytosis and reduction in splenomegaly. Three patients eventually became refractory to hydroxyurea, manifesting progressive neutrophilia without blastic transformation. Aggressive chemotherapy to control progressive leukocytosis resulted in death due to cytopenias in two of these patients. The third patient received less intensive chemotherapy and died of progressive disease. One patient died after transformation of the disease into undifferentiated acute myeloid leukemia. Two patients remain alive with stable disease on hydroxyurea therapy, 12 and 54 months after initial diagnosis. Chronic neutrophilic leukemia is a rare clinicopathologic entity that can be distinguished from chronic myelogenous leukemia, the recently described neutrophilic-chronic myelogenous leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome. The clinical course is heterogeneous, with a definite risk of death from either blastic transformation or progressive neutrophilic leukocytosis. Continued study and reporting of these cases must be encouraged.

### Leukemoid reaction: a 21st-century cohort study [^116uGvRE]. International Journal of Laboratory Hematology (2020). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on leukemoid reaction:

- **Definition**: A leukemoid reaction is a reactive and non-malignant leukocytosis characterized by a markedly elevated WBC count, typically exceeding 50,000/mcL, which can resemble leukemia in peripheral smear findings. It is a physiologic response to a severe stressor or inflammatory stimulus and resolves with treatment of the underlying cause.
- **Pathophysiology**: The leukemoid response is driven by cytokine-mediated bone marrow stimulation, most notably by G-CSF and IL-6, leading to accelerated myelopoiesis and the premature release of mature and immature myeloid cells into the circulation. This reactive, non-clonal proliferation is typically accompanied by an elevated leukocyte ALP score and a peripheral smear showing a left shift, toxic granulation, and Döhle bodies, without circulating blasts or BCR-ABL1 rearrangement. This exaggerated marrow response may result from a range of underlying conditions. The most common causes are severe infections such as C. difficile infection, disseminated tuberculosis, and severe shigellosis, in which the leukemoid reaction may indicate disease severity or precede complications such as hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Malignancies, including lung and renal cell carcinomas, can induce leukemoid responses through the secretion of hematopoietic growth factors, with extreme leukocytosis often reflecting a paraneoplastic process. Additional neoplastic associations include melanoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and sarcomas, where the leukemoid response may resolve with tumor-directed therapy but is frequently associated with a poor prognosis. Non-infectious stimuli such as extensive tissue necrosis from trauma, severe burns, or retroperitoneal hemorrhage, as well as acute hemorrhage or hemolysis, can also activate this response. Certain medications, including corticosteroids, minocycline, and recombinant hematopoietic growth factors, are recognized pharmacologic triggers. Toxic exposures such as ethylene glycol ingestion have also been implicated. Less common causes include mesenteric inflammatory pseudotumor and alcoholic steatohepatitis.
- **Epidemiology**: Leukemoid reactions are relatively rare, reported to account for approximately 0.59% of hospital admissions. They are more frequently encountered in critically ill patients.
- **Disease course**: Patients with a leukemoid reaction usually present with signs and symptoms related to the inciting condition rather than the leukocytosis itself. The leukocyte count may rise rapidly but generally stabilizes or declines once the underlying process is controlled. In cases of infection or inflammation, this may occur within several days to a week. If the leukocytosis persists despite resolution of the suspected trigger, further investigation is warranted to exclude hematologic malignancy. The overall prognosis depends on the underlying cause rather than the leukemoid response. The diagnostic evaluation of a leukemoid reaction focuses on distinguishing it from clonal hematologic malignancies, particularly chronic myeloid leukemia and chronic neutrophilic leukemia, while identifying the underlying reactive trigger. Initial assessment should include a thorough clinical history, physical examination, and focused laboratory and imaging studies to identify infections, malignancies, drug exposures, or toxic insults. A CBC with differential, peripheral blood smear, and leukocyte ALP (LAP) score are key first-line investigations. Leukemoid reaction typically presents with leukocytosis exceeding 50,000/mcL, marked neutrophilia with a left shift, toxic granulation, and high LAP scores. A peripheral smear helps exclude chronic myeloid leukemia, which often shows basophilia and a broader spectrum of immature cells. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy may reveal myeloid hyperplasia with orderly maturation, distinguishing leukemoid reaction from acute leukemia or advanced myeloproliferative neoplasms. Cytogenetic analysis, including BCR-ABL1 testing via PCR or FISH, is essential to rule out chronic myeloid leukemia. In ambiguous cases, clonality studies such as the HUMARA assay may be used to demonstrate polyclonal myelopoiesis consistent with LR. Additional tests may include cultures (blood, sputum, stool) to evaluate for infectious causes, especially C. difficile or Shigella species. Imaging (such as chest and abdominal CT) is warranted when malignancy is suspected. If a solid tumor is identified, biopsy with immunohistochemical staining for granulocyte- or GM-CSF may confirm a cytokine-secreting source. While measurement of circulating hematopoietic growth factors is not routine, elevated levels may support a paraneoplastic etiology.

### Elevation in white blood cell count after corticosteroid use in noninfected hospitalized patients [^112mn4YU]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

It is widely accepted that corticosteroids cause leukocytosis. Clinicians must decide whether a rise in white blood cell (WBC) count is due to steroids versus other processes like developing infection.

Objective

The objective of this study is to measure the increase in white blood cell count after corticosteroid administration in hospitalized patients without malignancy, infection, or immune dysfunction.

Methods

This is a retrospective cohort study from 2017 to 2018 in a single large healthcare system. We analyzed the trajectory of WBC count stratified by steroid dose. The study included nonsurgical patients admitted with at least two complete blood count measurements. Patients were excluded if they had immunosuppression, infection, malignancy, or steroid use within 2 weeks before admission. The main outcome was mean WBC count by day following corticosteroid administration.

Results

Our sample included 28,425 patients with at least two WBC measurements, 1608 (5.7%) of which received steroids. WBC response peaked at 48h after steroid administration with a mean increase of 2.4×10⁹/L WBCs. In all patients on steroids, across doses, the mean increase was 0.3×10⁹/L WBCs, 1.7×10⁹/L WBCs, and 4.84×10⁹/L WBCs in low, medium, and high dose groups, respectively. For patients not on steroids, the mean WBC count decreased during hospitalization.

Conclusions

When interpreting WBC counts after initiating steroids, increases of up to 4.84×10⁹/L cells may be seen within 48h after high-dose steroids. Larger increases, and any increase after low-dose steroids, suggest other causes of leukocytosis.

### Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis: right track or red herring? [^114fy4Ve]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL), a newly recognized entity found in approximately 3% of normal persons, precedes chronic lymphocytic leukemia. However, MBLs progress into overt malignancy only in a very minor portion of cases, thus raising the clinical concern of whether and how we can discriminate at diagnosis which rare cases will evolve into a fully fledged tumor. Understanding the molecular/biologic features underlying the risk of progression may significantly modify our strategies for correctly managing B-cell premalignant states. MBL cells bear the same chromosomal abnormalities of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Genome-wide sequencing and animal models indicate that genetic abnormalities disrupting the control of cell growth and survival cooperate with microenvironment-triggered events, mainly represented by antigen-mediated B-cell receptor and coreceptor stimulation, to trigger and fuel clonal expansion. The initial functional activation of survival/proliferation pathways may later become subsidized by autonomous genetic abnormalities (eg, a single mutation) affecting the same or parallel critical signaling pathway(s).

### Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, and T-cell clones of uncertain significance: are these premalignant conditions sharing a common identity? [^112bdAsG]. The Lancet: Haematology (2023). High credibility.

Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, and T-cell clones of uncertain significance are three premalignant conditions characterised by the presence of small clonal cell expansions in individuals without symptoms or signs that distinguish the related overt malignancies (chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, multiple myeloma, and T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukaemia). As most individuals with these precursor states never progress to malignancies, considerable interest has arisen in comprehending the steps involved in the progression to malignancy, providing more accurate models to investigate potential mechanisms of early blood cancer identification, prevention, and, possibly, intervention. Single-cell technologies and recent progress in high-throughput sequencing and multiomics approaches have contributed to a better definition of the pathophysiological mechanisms of these premalignant conditions, moving our knowledge in the field forward. In this Viewpoint, we analyse the seemingly shared biological trajectories in these precursor haematological malignancies in search of common pathogenetic events. In particular, we address the issue of interactions between expanding clones and their immune ecosystem, offering new clues that might prompt innovative ideas and inspire further investigations to understand the cellular and molecular dynamics entailing progression into overt malignant disease. The relationships between the non-leukaemic microenvironmental cells and the leukaemic counterpart, and the primary drivers of their initial clonal expansion, represent shared biologies that suggest a common identity among the premalignant conditions considered in this Viewpoint.

Induction chemotherapy

Unfortunately, despite the aggressivity of induction chemotherapy, it has not been reported to induce hematological remission in CNL. There is one account of a patient in blast phase attaining a second chronic phase following AML induction-type "7 + 3" chemotherapy; however, the majority of patients are either refractory or succumb to treatment-related mortality, most notably complications of cytopenias including intracranial hemorrhage and sepsis.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia treatment algorithm 2018 [^111MWJhX]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on chronic lymphocytic leukemia:

- **Definition**: CLL is a lymphoproliferative malignancy characterized by peripheral lymphocytosis due to the proliferation of clonal B cells.
- **Pathophysiology**: CLL is caused by somatic gene mutations involving multipotent and self-renewing hematopoietic stem cells, which leads to clonal proliferation and accumulation of mature B cells.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of CLL in the US is estimated at 4.83 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: Accumulation of B cells in the bone marrow, blood, lymph nodes, and spleen can result in cytopenias, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, susceptibility to infection, bone marrow failure, and death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The overall survival at 5-years for patients with low-risk, intermediate-risk, high-risk, and very-high risk CLL is 93.2%, 79.4%, 63.6%, and 23.3%, respectively.

### Pregnancy in a woman with chronic neutrophilic leukemia [^115YToSx]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic neutrophilic leukemia is a rare myeloproliferative disorder in women of reproductive age.

Case

A pregnant woman with an established diagnosis of chronic neutrophilic leukemia presented at 26 weeks of gestation with splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, and anemia. Thrombocytopenia was refractory to medical treatment and, in part, was attributed to splenic sequestration. She delivered a healthy neonate at 35 weeks of gestation by repeat cesarean delivery under general anesthesia. Her preoperative platelet count was 30,000/mL and she was transfused platelets throughout the perioperative period. Her postpartum course was complicated by intraabdominal hemorrhage and severe preeclampsia. She recovered with intensive medical and surgical management.

Conclusion

Chronic neutrophilic leukemia poses difficult challenges during pregnancy and requires a multidisciplinary approach.

### Elevation in white blood cell count after corticosteroid use in noninfected hospitalized patients [^111314sy]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Our much larger sample allowed us to examine the interaction between timing and dose effect, which other studies have not considered. This is important because we found large differences by dose and days since steroid initiation. Proper interpretation requires consideration of both factors. Furthermore, the study of a specifically noninfected cohort allows us to define an expected range of WBC response to steroids not related to infection or malignancy.

Our findings should have practical import for clinicians working in hospital medicine. Elevated WBCs are common in the hospital, as are conditions that require treatment with steroids. Whether to initiate a work‐up for the leukocytosis depends on the clinician's judgment, but an important consideration is the expected rise in WBCs following steroid initiation. The dosages we studied are typical of those given in routine hospital care, and our large sample allowed us to estimate changes over time at different dosages. For example, patients with COPD are often treated with 60 mg of prednisone daily. In that case, a subsequent rise in WBC should not be attributed to steroids. In contrast, if a patient received methylprednisolone 125 mg three times daily, the WBC would be expected to rise 4–5 points by 48 h. However, no rise would be expected in the first 24 h. Nor should there be a new spike after 3 or 4 days. Such unexpected rises, either by timing or magnitude, should raise suspicion of a pathological process. Physicians may use clinical factors to further investigate leukocytosis and potential infection including vital sign abnormalities or biomarkers of infection or inflammation such as procalcitonin, C‐reactive protein, or erythrocyte sedimentation rate.

Our study has several limitations. It is from a single health system and may not be generalizable. We did not include infected patients, who may have different responses to steroids. We reported mean increases, but individuals likely have varied responses. We were unable to discern the exact indication for steroid use in our patients due to the nature of the data; however, we tried to assess this by proxy of their comorbidities and control for chronic steroid use by excluding patients with recent outpatient steroid prescription fills. Additionally, we found similar trends in WBC in patients with and without COPD.

### Chronic neutrophilic leukemia: new science and new diagnostic criteria [^115KWWGf]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical features

CNL is a clinically heterogeneous disease which may present as incidental neutrophilic leukocytosis on a routine blood count or alternatively with a spectrum of constitutional symptoms including fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, bone pain, easy bruising, pruritus, or gout. The majority of patients are asymptomatic at diagnosis. Of presenting clinical manifestations, fatigue appears to be the most common. In a series of 14 molecularly defined CNL patients, 71% had antecedent chronic leukocytosis lasting a median of 12.5 months (range 5–84 months). Clinical examination may reveal splenomegaly (present in 36% in one series) involving primarily red pulp cords and sinuses, and/or hepatomegaly, but as in CML, lymph node involvement remains relatively uncommon.

There is substantial evidence for an association of CNL with a hemorrhagic diathesis. Reports as early as 1979 describe an "unexplained hemorrhagic tendency" in a portion of CNL patientswhich has been reiterated in later reports. including a considerable number of cases of cerebral hemorrhage. In a report by Bohm, of 14 new cases of CNL reviewed of which 10 had died (mean survival time 14.7 months), the most frequent cause of death was in fact cerebral hemorrhage, seen in six cases. Mechanistically, this bleeding diathesis has been attributed to thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction, and/or potentially to vascular wall infiltration by neoplastic cells. It has been suggested that patients displaying bleeding complications out of proportion to their platelet count be evaluated for acquired von Willebrand's disease and other acquired coagulation and platelet function disorders.

### Chronic variable stress activates hematopoietic stem cells [^115wYg3J]. Nature Medicine (2014). Excellent credibility.

Exposure to psychosocial stress is a risk factor for many diseases, including atherosclerosis. Although incompletely understood, interaction between the psyche and the immune system provides one potential mechanism linking stress and disease inception and progression. Known cross-talk between the brain and immune system includes the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which centrally drives glucocorticoid production in the adrenal cortex, and the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary axis, which controls stress-induced catecholamine release in support of the fight-or-flight reflex. It remains unknown, however, whether chronic stress changes hematopoietic stem cell activity. Here we show that stress increases proliferation of these most primitive hematopoietic progenitors, giving rise to higher levels of disease-promoting inflammatory leukocytes. We found that chronic stress induced monocytosis and neutrophilia in humans. While investigating the source of leukocytosis in mice, we discovered that stress activates upstream hematopoietic stem cells. Under conditions of chronic variable stress in mice, sympathetic nerve fibers released surplus noradrenaline, which signaled bone marrow niche cells to decrease CXCL12 levels through the β3-adrenergic receptor. Consequently, hematopoietic stem cell proliferation was elevated, leading to an increased output of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes. When atherosclerosis-prone Apoe(-/-) mice were subjected to chronic stress, accelerated hematopoiesis promoted plaque features associated with vulnerable lesions that cause myocardial infarction and stroke in humans.

### Chronic neutrophilic leukemia: 2020 update on diagnosis, molecular genetics, prognosis, and management [^111SMYdS]. American Journal of Hematology (2020). Medium credibility.

Disease Overview

Chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) is a rare, often aggressive myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) defined by persistent mature neutrophilic leukocytosis, bone marrow granulocyte hyperplasia, and frequent hepatosplenomegaly. The seminal discovery of oncogenic driver mutations in colony-stimulating factor 3 receptor (CSF3R) in the majority of patients with CNL in 2013 anchored a new scientific framework, deepening our understanding of its molecular pathogenesis, providing a diagnostic biomarker, and rationalizing the use of pharmacological targeting.

Diagnostic Criteria

In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) included the presence of activating CSF3R mutations as a central diagnostic feature of CNL. Other criteria include leukocytosis of ≥ 25×10⁹/L comprising > 80% neutrophils with < 10% circulating precursors and rare blasts, and absence of dysplasia or monocytosis, while not fulfilling criteria for other MPN.

Disease Updates

Increasingly comprehensive genetic profiling of CNL has disclosed a complex genomic landscape and additional prognostically relevant mutational combinations. Though prognostic determination and therapeutic decision-making remain challenging, emerging data on prognostic markers and the use of newer therapeutic agents, such as JAK inhibitors, are helping to define state-of-the-art management in CNL.

### Chronic neutrophilic leukemia: new science and new diagnostic criteria [^114ieGNV]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Differential diagnosis

Neutrophilic leukocytosis may underlie a wide variety of diseases, both benign and malignant. Furthermore, the clinical and laboratory features of CNL may overlap with these disorders. Given that an accurate diagnosis of CNL requires exclusion of a number of mimickers, it is critical to consider potentially confounding diagnoses such as reactive neutrophilia/leukemoid reaction, CML, CML-N, MPN/MDS (myeloproliferative neoplasms/myelodysplastic syndromes) overlap disorders such as aCML and CMML, as well as other myeloid neoplasms.

Distinguishing CNL from a leukemoid reaction can be challenging given that both may present with significant neutrophilia, bone marrow hypercellularity, normal cytogenetics, and absence of BCR-ABL fusion gene. WBC count may be more modestly elevated in leukemoid reaction, though there have been some reports of WBC counts up to 100 × 10⁹/L in this context. Meticulous history-taking along with a thorough clinical examination to exclude alternate diagnoses, including occult malignancy or infection, and a period of observation is often recommended before formally determining the diagnosis. The demonstration of clonality including identification of a CSF3R mutation or other molecular or cytogenetic abnormality is clearly valuable in aligning the diagnosis in favor of CNL.

CML is invariably associated with a BCR-ABL fusion gene and displays a disproportionally higher percentage of myelocytes. CML also commonly presents with basophilia, thrombocytosis, or eosinophilia. While the absence of the Philadelphia chromosome is implicit to CNL diagnosis, a rare form of CML termed neutrophilic-CML, or CML-N, has been described which shares morphological features of CNL, specifically a prominent neutrophilic proliferation. CML-N, however, is characterized by an uncommon BCR-ABL translocation which results in the transcription of an e19/a2 type BCR-ABL messenger RNA yielding a 230-kD BCR-ABL protein (p230). The clinical correlate is a lower total WBC count, less severe anemia, less prominent splenomegaly, and blastic transformation occurring much later in CML-N patients. The attenuated phenotype and indolent course of CML-N, specifically in patients without additional cytogenetic abnormalities, is now postulated to be due to low p230 mRNA and protein levels. The diagnosis of CNL also requires that molecular testing be negative for defining markers of alternate neoplasms including not only the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene but also rearrangements in PDGFRA/B or FGFR1, characteristic of eosinophilic leukemia.

### Elevation in white blood cell count after corticosteroid use in noninfected hospitalized patients [^1164RvGb]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

It is widely accepted that corticosteroids cause leukocytosis. Clinicians must decide whether a rise in white blood cell (WBC) count is due to steroids versus other processes like developing infection.

Objective

The objective of this study is to measure the increase in white blood cell count after corticosteroid administration in hospitalized patients without malignancy, infection, or immune dysfunction.

Methods

This is a retrospective cohort study from 2017 to 2018 in a single large healthcare system. We analyzed the trajectory of WBC count stratified by steroid dose. The study included nonsurgical patients admitted with at least two complete blood count measurements. Patients were excluded if they had immunosuppression, infection, malignancy, or steroid use within 2 weeks before admission. The main outcome was mean WBC count by day following corticosteroid administration.

Results

Our sample included 28,425 patients with at least two WBC measurements, 1608 (5.7%) of which received steroids. WBC response peaked at 48 h after steroid administration with a mean increase of 2.4 × 10⁹/L WBCs. In all patients on steroids, across doses, the mean increase was 0.3 × 10⁹/L WBCs, 1.7 × 10⁹/L WBCs, and 4.84 × 10⁹/L WBCs in low, medium, and high dose groups, respectively. For patients not on steroids, the mean WBC count decreased during hospitalization.

Conclusions

When interpreting WBC counts after initiating steroids, increases of up to 4.84 × 10⁹/L cells may be seen within 48 h after high‐dose steroids. Larger increases, and any increase after low‐dose steroids, suggest other causes of leukocytosis.

### Hematopoietic stem cells in wound healing response [^1119skRL]. Advances in Wound Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Overview

HSCs and hematopoietic progenitor cells, collectively called hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs) maintain the homeostatic output of blood cells throughout the lifespan, and their deteriorations cause hematologic disorders, including anemia, bleeding or clotting disorders, and blood cancers. At the same time, many diseases and conditions that accompany damaged tissues in the organs other than the hematopoietic system exhibit hematopoietic abnormality.

Hematopoiesis occurs on-demand in a wound injury involving blood loss and acute inflammation. In blood loss, erythroid progenitor cells, as well as their upstream HSPCs, become activated to generate red blood cells as well as white blood cells or leukocytes. In acute inflammation, generating leukocytes through hematopoiesis is crucial to restoring tissue integrity. The demand for myeloid cells (especially neutrophils and monocytes) increases as an extent of tissue injury gets larger. Myelopoiesis rates are adjusted accordingly to meet the additional need for innate immune cells and to replenish depleted reserves, at the expense of the erythroid and lymphoid cell generation.

Compared with lymphocytes, myeloid cells are more relying on their generation through hematopoiesis (myelopoiesis) because they have a relatively short lifespan and their number reflects innate immune responses. Myeloid cells such as neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, and dendritic cells are major players in wound healing. Studying injury-induced myelopoiesis should provide a better understanding of myeloid-mediated healing responses.

Hematopoiesis, especially enhanced myelopoiesis, is suggested to contribute to chronic inflammation, which is often accompanied by leukocytosis. The conditions with chronic inflammation increase the risk for nonhealing wounds or chronic wounds, which represent a significant health problem in the United States with millions of patients afflicted and the associated treatment costing billions of dollars per year. Such conditions, including obesity and/or diabetes, autoimmune, atherosclerosis, pre-existing cancer, and infections are associated with dysregulated myelopoiesis and myeloid system, which are often seen as leukocytosis.

### Is it primary myelofibrosis or chronic megakaryocytic leukemia? [^111bPdEc]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

One could ask whether essential (primary) thrombocythemia is not, also, a chronic megakaryocytic leukemia? It is one in the sense that it is a clonal disorder originating in a primitive multipotential hematopoietic cell in which its principal expression is exaggerated neoplastic megakaryo-cytopoiesis and elevated platelet counts, but the term thrombocythemia captures the central issue. It is, in effect, an indolent myelogenous leukemia if one uses the term "myelogenous leukemia" to designate the spectrum of neoplasms that originate in a mutated multipotential hematopoietic progenitor cell, as we do for the overwhelming majority of those disorders. Moreover, primary thrombocythemia is never associated with leukemic blast cells in blood or marrow. Indolent myelogenous leukemia is a counterpoint to acute (polyblastic) and subacute (oligoblastic) myelogenous leukemias and is not meant to imply the absence of morbidity. It, too, carries a risk of clonal evolution to a more severe myeloid neoplasm, notably acute myelogenous leukemia. I do not suggest changing its name, as the term "leukemia" has come to mean something to the laity with which the patient with thrombocythemia should not be confronted, as is the case with polycythemia vera, another neoplasm of the multi-potential progenitor cell (an indolent myelogenous leukemia with a risk of evolution to acute myelogenous leukemia). In the case of polycythemia, indolent leukemia is characterized by differentiation of the mutant hematopoietic multipotential cell, such that it provides clonal platelets, neutrophils, other granulocytes and red cells that are phenocopies of normal cells and highly functional. The distinction of thrombocythemia from chronic megakaryocytic leukemia (primary myelofibrosis in the WHO classification) is a profound one, as noted by the markedly longer life expectancy on average of a patient with thrombocythemia (median survival of 20 years) at the time of diagnosis as compared to a patient with primary myelofibrosis who has a median survival of 5 years after diagnosis. Thus, the nosological grouping (chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms) of polycythemia vera, thrombocythemia and so-called primary myelofibrosis has a genetic basis but primary myelofibrosis (chronic mega-karyocytic leukemia) has a strikingly different course, management and prognosis. In 1942, amidst the Nazi occupation of France, and at a time in which there was a primitive understanding of multipotential hematopoietic progenitor cell neoplasms, Chevallier discussed the "odoleukemias". He chose the Greek word, odo, meaning threshold, to highlight disorders that are on the threshold of overt leukemia. Chevallier proposed "leucoses" as the generic term for "leucémie" so that marked variations in white cell and blast counts and other presenting features would not engender inappropriate terminology.

### "Cecal gangrene": a rare cause of right-sided inferior abdominal quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis [^1151rMVD]. Emergency Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

We report on a 58-year-old man with known diabetes, congestive heart failure, and need for chronic hemodialysis presenting with right lower abdominal quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis. Although initial clinical findings were highly suggestive of acute appendicitis, CT revealed marked circumferential wall thickening of the cecum, which was interpreted as cecal infarction by the radiologist. Intraoperatively, cecal necrosis was confirmed, but the ileocecal valve and, especially, the appendix showed no ischemia. No vascular occlusions were found. Histopathologic analysis of the resected cecum demonstrated isolated transmural cecal necrosis with marked infiltration of the cecal wall by numerous bacteria and neutrophils. We present the CT features and histopathologic findings of isolated cecal gangrene, review the pathogenesis of occlusive and nonocclusive cecal ischemia or infarction, and discuss the role of bacterial superinfection as a potential cofactor in the pathogenesis of isolated cecal necrosis which should be included in the differential diagnosis of right-sided inferior abdominal quadrant pain.

### Cohort study of fever and leukocytosis as diagnostic and prognostic indicators in infected surgical patients [^115LBJV9]. World Journal of Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

The presence of fever and leukocytosis have traditionally been utilized as important diagnostic markers of infection despite some who question their reliability. To examine this point, the role of fever and leukocytosis as diagnostic and prognostic indicators for surgical infections was evaluated. A prospective observational study was performed on all patients with suspected infection in 1997 on the general surgical services at a university hospital. Fever was defined as maximum temperature (Tmax) ≥ 38.5 degrees C, and leukocytosis was defined as a white blood cell (WBC) count ≥ 11,000/microl. Among all infections, patients presenting with a Tmax ≥ 38.5 degrees C were younger (51.3 ± 1.1 vs. 53.8 ± 0.9 years, p = 0.005) and had a higher APACHE II score (15.1 ± 0.5 vs. 11.4 ± 0.4; p < 0.001). By logistic regression analysis chronic renal insufficiency was associated with a Tmax < 38.5 degrees C [odds ratio (OR) 0.371, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.195–0.704], and chronic steroid therapy was associated with a WBC count < 11,000/microl (OR 0.556, 95% CI 0.335–0.921). In addition, infected transplant patients were more likely to present with a Tmax < 38.5 degrees C and a WBC count < 11,000/microl (OR 0.195, 95% CI 0.075–0.502). Mortality rates for infected patients with a Tmax < 38.5 degrees C or > 38.5 degrees C were 11.6% and 12.9%, respectively (p < 0.7), and the lengths of stay were 14 ± 1 and 18 ± 1 days, respectively (p < 0.03). Mortality rates for patients with a WBC count < 11,000/microl or > 11,000/microl were 4.7% and 18.6%, respectively (p < 0.001), and the lengths of stay were 14 ± 1 and 19 ± 1 days, respectively (p < 0.001). In the setting of infection, chronic renal insufficiency and chronic steroid therapy are associated with suppression of fever and leukocytosis, respectively. Transplantation is an independent predictor of infection in patients presenting without fever or leukocytosis. Leukocytosis, but not fever, may be predictive of hospital mortality in infected surgical patients.

Chronic meningitis is characterized by a progressive, subacute onset of lepomeningeal disease and persisting cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) abnormalities such as elevated protein level and pleocytosis for at least one month. The array of aetiologies is very wide comprising non-infectious (carcinomatous, systemic disease, toxic) and infectious (classic and opportunistic pathogens). The evaluation encompasses a careful history, complete physical examination and laboratory tests. The specific diagnosis may remain a challenge in some cases. Algorithms for the differential diagnosis are provided for both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients.

Lymphocytosis is more likely to be benign in children than in adults. 4 Epstein-Barr virus infection, tuberculosis or fungal disease, autoimmune disease, splenectomy, protozoan or rickettsial infections, and malignancy can cause monocytosis.
8. 3, can arise from a variety of etiologies.

Any source of stress can cause a catecholamine-induced demargination of WBCs, as well as increased release from the bone marrow storage pool. Examples include surgery, exercise, trauma, burns, and emotional stress.; sometimes, as the infection progresses, there is a shift to lymphocyte predominance. The release of less-mature bands and metamyelocytes into the peripheral circulation results in the so-called "left shift" in the WBC differential. Of note, some bacterial infections paradoxically cause neutropenias, such as typhoid fever, rickettsial infections, brucellosis, and dengue. 1, 14 Viral infections may cause leukocytosis early in their course, but a sustained leukocytosis is not typical, except for the lymphocytosis in some childhood viral infections. Other acquired causes of leukocytosis include functional asplenia, smoking, and obesity.

Patients with a chronic inflammatory condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, or a granulomatous disease, may also exhibit leukocytosis. Genetic causes include hereditary or chronic idiopathic neutrophilia and Down syndrome. Malignant Etiologies Leukocytosis may herald a malignant disorder, such as an acute or chronic leukemia.

### Chronic neutrophilic leukemia: new science and new diagnostic criteria [^111Gxk3c]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The fundamental question plaguing this relationship has remained whether the CNL and plasma cell disorders are clonally related or whether the neutrophilia is secondary to the underlying plasma cell neoplasm. Erber and Reilly raised this question in their aptly titled commentary "Chronic neutrophilic leukemia with plasma cell dyscrasia: friends or relatives?". Overall, three main hypotheses have emerged: firstly, the possibility of a common progenitor cell differentiating along both myeloid and lymphoid lines resulting in a biphenotypic neoplasm; secondly, the co-existence of two independent clonal disorders; and thirdly, a purely reactive neutrophilia associated with the plasma cell dyscrasia. The aforementioned review by Bain et al. asserts that leukocytosis in suspected concurrent neoplasms is attributable, in the majority of cases, to cytokine-driven neutrophilia accompanying the primary plasma cell neoplasmand there is substantial evidence corroborating this, including demonstration of high G-CSF levels and neutrophil counts in a patient with myeloma whose levels declined upon treatment with steroids. Moreover, several other studies have confirmed G-CSF synthesis by neoplastic plasma cells –. Furthermore, there are reports supporting the polyclonal nature of the plasma cell dyscrasia-associated neutrophilia, cases of spontaneous remission of the presumed CNL, and even improvements in neutrophil count and hepatosplenomegaly following treatment of the underlying dysproteinemia. Another important distinction is a prognostic one as MGUS-associated CNL patients appeared to have superior survival when compared to strictly WHO-defined CNL, suggesting different etiopathogeneses. The fact that Pardanani et al. did not find CSF3R mutations in five cases of plasma cell neoplasm-associated "CNL" also suggests that both entities are distinct. In addition, the fact that MGUS is common within the age range in which CNL characteristically occurs further supports a merely incidental association. As a whole, this data argue in favor of polyclonal neutrophilic proliferation secondary to antecedent or underlying plasma cell disorder. Consequently, any suspected association should be confirmed by demonstrating neutrophil clonality.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia treatment algorithm 2022 [^112Bw3xj]. Blood Cancer Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The 2022 lymphoid neoplasm classification updates from the World Health Organization and the International Consensus Classification Clinical Advisory Committee agree in defining chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) as a low-grade lymphoproliferative neoplasm with ≥ 5 × 10⁹/L clonal B-cells in the peripheral circulation that express CD5, CD19, CD20(dim), and CD23. All cases of CLL are preceded by monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL), a pre-malignant condition defined as < 5 × 10⁹/L clonal B-cells in the absence of lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, and cytopenias. MBL has been detected in approximately 10–15% of healthy individuals > 40 years of age, making it one of the most common premalignant conditions in humans. Aside from the risk of progression from MBL to CLL requiring therapy (estimated at ~1–2% per year for individuals with high-count MBL [defined by a clonal B-cell count between 0.5 and 5 × 10⁹/L]), patients with high- or low-count MBL have an increased risk for infections and lymphoid malignancies. However, individuals with MBL and early stage asymptomatic CLL who do not meet the 2018 International Workshop on CLL [iwCLL] criteria to initiate therapy should be offered close follow-up ("wait and watch"). This review will focus on our current approach in the management of patients with CLL from the time of diagnosis through the relapsed setting. Although this schema can be used for CLL patients worldwide, variable availability and regulatory approval of many novel agents outside the United States may limit its broader applicability. In this article, corresponding sections of the treatment algorithm Figures are noted in parentheses (Figure number and numbered section within that Figure) preceding the relevant text to facilitate reference between the content areas.

### Management of urticaria: not too complicated, not too simple [^112ad1GH]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Is it necessary to perform extensive diagnostic studies by complementary testing in all patients with CSU?

The indiscriminate search for underlying causes that may include an extensive battery of tests is discouraged – due to low cost-effectiveness. A careful and detailed medical history and physical examination are essential. Patient-oriented questions are helpful to establish the type of chronic urticaria and to define baseline laboratory studies and/or other complementary tests tailored to the individual patient (Table 2). In most cases, there is no need to order an extensive work-up unless data from the clinical history suggest an underlying disease. Table 3 lists the essential tests that should be performed.

Table 2
Recommended data to obtain from the patient's medical history

Table 3
Minimal work-up studies on chronic spontaneous urticaria *

Key point: Unless suggested by the clinical history, there is no need to perform extensive tests when examining a CSU patient.

What is the differential diagnosis to be established for a patient with CSU?

Apart from urticaria vasculitis for which diagnosis is made through biopsy, It can be difficult to differentiate hives from other dermatoses (Table 4). However, the natural course differs in these pathologies. Erythema multiform clears on its own within a maximum of 3 weeks; it is included in the differential diagnosis because of its severity and should always be ruled out at the onset of symptoms, when it can resemble chronic urticaria. Autoinflammatory syndromes have symptoms that may be confused with chronic urticaria, but they are rare, and although skin rashes are always associated with systemic symptoms, itching is not as striking a feature as it is in the case of chronic urticaria. Certain systemic diseases are associated with urticaria-like lesions, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Schnitzler syndrome (IgM monoclonal gammopathy, urticaria, fever, lymphadenopathy and weight loss), mastocytosis and hypereosinophilic syndromes.

Key point: Chronic urticaria differs from other dermatosis on its duration, the evanescence of lesions and intense itching.

### Exercise reduces inflammatory cell production and cardiovascular inflammation via instruction of hematopoietic progenitor cells [^1152bEE6]. Nature Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

A sedentary lifestyle, chronic inflammation and leukocytosis increase atherosclerosis; however, it remains unclear whether regular physical activity influences leukocyte production. Here we show that voluntary running decreases hematopoietic activity in mice. Exercise protects mice and humans with atherosclerosis from chronic leukocytosis but does not compromise emergency hematopoiesis in mice. Mechanistically, exercise diminishes leptin production in adipose tissue, augmenting quiescence-promoting hematopoietic niche factors in leptin-receptor-positive stromal bone marrow cells. Induced deletion of the leptin receptor in Prrx1-creER T2; Lepr fl/fl mice reveals that leptin's effect on bone marrow niche cells regulates hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) proliferation and leukocyte production, as well as cardiovascular inflammation and outcomes. Whereas running wheel withdrawal quickly reverses leptin levels, the impact of exercise on leukocyte production and on the HSPC epigenome and transcriptome persists for several weeks. Together, these data show that physical activity alters HSPCs via modulation of their niche, reducing hematopoietic output of inflammatory leukocytes.

### Cardiovascular collapse and mcConnell's sign as early manifestations of leucostasis [^113XwjLC]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

A man in his late 70s with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia presented for evaluation of acute leukaemic transformation and initiation of cytoreductive therapy after being found to have asymptomatic hyperleucocytosis. Within 24 hours, the patient developed vasopressor-refractory shock, severe lactic acidosis and multiorgan failure. Serial echocardiographic assessments revealed interval enlargement of the right ventricle with development of the McConnell's sign, and abdominal CT showed diffuse bowel wall thickening, likely due to ischaemia. CT angiography excluded pulmonary embolism or occlusion of intra-abdominal arteries. Despite aggressive care, the patient died from cardiovascular collapse within 8hours of the onset of hypotension. An autopsy revealed extensive infiltration of early myeloid cells in pulmonary, myocardial, hepatic and intestinal microvasculature. This case illustrates different mechanisms by which leucostasis causes acute cardiovascular collapse and stresses the emergent nature of this diagnosis.

### The microenvironment in myeloproliferative neoplasms [^111d7TAR]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic inflammation is a hallmark of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), with elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines being commonly found in all 3 subtypes. Systemic inflammation is responsible for the constitutional symptoms, thrombosis risk, premature atherosclerosis, and disease evolution in MPN. Although the neoplastic clone and their differentiated progeny drive the inflammatory process, they also induce ancillary cytokine secretion from nonmalignant cells. Here, the authors describe the inflammatory milieu in MPN based on soluble factors and cellular mediators. They also discuss the prognostic value of cytokine measurements in patients with MPN and potential therapeutic strategies that target the cellular players in inflammation.

### Hyperkalemia in the setting of severe leukocytosis: should you treat? [^117QSbyY]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe hyperkalemia is a common and life-threatening problem presenting to the emergency department. Rapid correction of the electrolyte abnormality is essential but doing so can be detrimental in circumstances under which delaying treatment for confirmation is required. Our case exemplifies one of those scenarios: pseudohyperkalemia in the setting of severe leukocytosis.

Case

An elderly woman with long-standing but untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia presented with a left hip fracture. She was found to have a potassium level of 8.4 mEq/L without symptoms of hyperkalemia, renal disease, or EKG findings. Her white blood cell count was 444 K/uL. Despite a potentially life-threatening hyperkalemia, correction was deferred pending confirmation by venous whole blood, which revealed a normal potassium level.

Discussion

Pseudohyperkalemia can occur in the setting of severe leukocytosis. It is important for emergency physicians to recognize this phenomenon and avoid iatrogenic hypokalemia. The pathophysiology behind this phenomenon and the methods for correct analysis are presented here.

### CD47 overexpression is associated with decreased neutrophil apoptosis / phagocytosis and poor prognosis in non-small-cell lung cancer patients [^115DUhVs]. British Journal of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death worldwide and the second most common cancer among both men and women. The majority of patients are diagnosed with advanced-stage disease, and despite technological advancements on all fronts of clinical practice, the prognosis for patients with lung cancer remains dismal. Haematologic abnormalities, including anaemia, thrombocytosis and leukocytosis are frequently observed in lung cancer patients. Although neutrophilic leukocytosis (also known as neutrophilia) has long been reported in patients with lung cancer, the underlying mechanisms leading to this condition have not been fully elucidated.

Acute inflammation is a physiological process through which the innate immune system responds to irritation, injury and infection. If unresolved, acute lung inflammation can progress to chronic inflammation, which has been directly implicated in a wide range of lung diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, asthma, cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema and lung cancer. Neutrophils are undoubtedly major effectors of acute and chronic inflammation. Consequently, a common feature between these diseases is chronic neutrophilic inflammation, as evidenced by an exacerbated and sustained infiltration of neutrophils into the lungs with concurrent neutrophilic leukocytosis.

In patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), there is a strong correlation between poor clinical outcomes and high neutrophil content, both locally and systemic, suggesting that neutrophils and inflammation have an important role during carcinogenesis.

Owing to their pro-inflammatory functions and potential toxicity against host tissue, neutrophil numbers are tightly regulated through a fine balance between their production, retention, mobilisation, margination and clearance from the system. Therefore, the successful resolution of inflammation involves the cessation of further neutrophil recruitment, the induction of neutrophils to undergo programmed cell death as well as the phagocytic clearance of dying cells.

Healthy cells are protected from phagocytosis by displaying anti-phagocytosis molecules such as CD31, CD200, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 and the integrin-associated protein/CD47. CD47 is expressed on the surface of many cells types but it is particularly abundant on red blood cells (RBCs) and leukocytes. Binding of CD47 to its macrophage receptor, signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRP- α), initiates a signal transduction cascade that results in the inhibition of phagocytosis. Conversely, in cells undergoing apoptosis, CD47 expression is reduced and phagocytosis increased. Under this setting, CD47 can also be redistributed into patches distant from the phagocytic synapse.

### Chronic neutrophilic leukemia: new science and new diagnostic criteria [^115kwAm1]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Revised 2016 WHO diagnostic criteria

In 2016, the WHO classification of hematologic malignancies was updated to reflect the changes in the genomic landscape of CNL, endorsing the CSF3R mutation's "strong association" with CNL. This justly represented the most significant modification with respect to the 2008 criteria. The presence of CSF3R T618I or another activating CSF3R mutation now comprises one of the five key diagnostic components of CNL. While these disease-defining mutations serve as diagnostic markers if present, the WHO also allows for the possibility of CSF3R -negative disease in the face of chronic neutrophilia, splenomegaly, and the exclusion of reactive leukocytosis. Though the absence of CSF3R mutation does not exclude the possibility of CNL, however, it should prompt careful review of the diagnosis and consideration of alternative diagnoses.

The rest of the updated 2016 WHO diagnostic criteria for CNL remain relatively unchanged and are summarized in Table 1. The criteria include: peripheral blood leukocytosis of ≥ 25 × 10⁹/L (of which > 80% are segmented neutrophils plus band forms and < 10% are neutrophil precursors with rare myeloblasts), monocyte count < 1 × 10⁹/L, and absence of dysgranulopoiesis, as well as hypercellular bone marrow with granulocyte hyperplasia, normal maturation, and < 5% myeloblasts. The remaining components are exclusionary and consist of absence of WHO criteria for another MPN and absence of rearrangements in PDGFRA, PDGFRB, FGRF1, or the newly added PCM1-JAK2. If there is an underlying plasma cell disorder, myeloid clonality must be demonstrated in order to make the additional diagnosis of CNL.

### Chronic neutrophilic leukemia: new science and new diagnostic criteria [^115EvQTV]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Laboratory findings

The hallmark of CNL is sustained, chronic, mature neutrophilia. In a series of WHO-defined CNL, the median leukocyte count was 39 × 10⁹/L (range: 11–126) with predominant neutrophilia. Importantly, CNL is characterized by the presence of more mature granulopoietic forms compared with CML, with granulocytes nearly exclusively (≥ 80%) at the segmented and band stage of development and minimal to no circulating blasts. The notable absence of monocytosis, basophilia, and eosinophilia is another feature of CNL. The majority of CNL patients present with mild anemia (median hemoglobin ~11 g/dL), and/or thrombocytopenia. More commonly, thrombocytopenia is reported with disease progression along with increasing splenomegaly, often heralding blast crisis. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels are typically elevated, as is the LAP score; this latter observation remains non-specific but contrasts with the low LAP score noted in CML. Vitamin B12 levels are also often elevated due to transcobalamin release from granulocytes and their precursors. Interestingly, low serum granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) levels have been documented in CNL patients by several groups – though this test is not readily available.

### Management of MPN beyond JAK2 [^111qoYsh]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2014). Low credibility.

Thrombocytosis has a large number of potential underlying causes, but the dominant group of hematological conditions for consideration in this setting are the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). In this chapter, we consider several key linked questions relating to the management of thrombocytosis in MPNs and discuss several issues. First, we discuss the differential diagnosis of thrombocytosis, which myeloid disorders to consider, and practical approaches to the discrimination of each individual MPN from other causes. Second, there have been several major advances in our understanding of the molecular biology of these conditions and we discuss how these findings are likely to be practically applied in the future. Third, we consider whether there is evidence that thrombocytosis contributes to the complications known to be associated with MPN: thrombosis, hemorrhage and transformation to leukemia and myelofibrosis. Last, we review current ideas for risk stratification and management of essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera as the 2 entities within the MPN family that are most frequently associated with thrombocytosis.

### Acute leukaemoid reaction following cardiac surgery [^1153vzrC]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) is an atypical myeloproliferative disorder characterized by an absolute peripheral blood monocyte count of greater than 1.0 × 10⁹/L, with evidence of both effective and ineffective haematopoiesis. The aetiology of CMML is complex and incompletely understood. It is twice as common in men, usually presenting in the seventh or eighth decades. Late clinical features include fatigue, weight loss, fever and night sweats, splenomegaly and hepatomegaly, although it may present as a chance finding on blood analysis. The bone marrow is usually hypercellular with granulocytic proliferation and it can be differentiated from classical chronic myeloid leukaemia by the high monocyte count and absence of a Philadelphia chromosome. Despite best medical therapy, the outcome remains poor with median survival less than two years from the time of diagnosis. Individual prognosis is difficult to predict, although approximately 20% of patients progress to acute myeloid leukaemia.

Cardiac surgery has been reported in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, myelodysplasia and other malignant haematological disorders but data on CMML are limited. We present a case of previously undiagnosed CMML who developed fatal complications following cardiac surgery.

### DOT1L: a key target in normal chromatin remodelling and in mixed-lineage leukaemia treatment [^111hgd6G]. Epigenetics (2020). Medium credibility.

DOT1L as a target in MLL-r leukaemia

Leukaemia is characterized by a neoplastic proliferation of haematopoietic stem cells, which induce the growth of a high number of abnormal white blood cells. Different types of leukaemia are grouped according to the speed of development – acute (fast growth) and chronic (slow growth) – and whether the disease starts from myeloid or lymphoid cells. Based on this classification, leukaemia is divided into four main groups: AML, chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia [75, 76].

AML and CML are cancers of the myeloid cells, which normally develop into mature blood cells such as red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. AML is characterized by an increase in the number of myeloid cells in the bone marrow and an arrest in their maturation, frequently resulting in haematopoietic insufficiency (granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, or anaemia) with or without leukocytosis [77]. Instead, ALL arises from the malignant transformation and proliferation of lymphoid progenitor cells in the bone marrow and blood.

### Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and prognosis of myelodysplastic syndromes [^115tKvuF]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) comprise a group of underrecognized hematologic clonal malignancies with variable propensity for leukemic transformation that can present a diagnostic challenge because they lack hallmark symptoms. MDS can present with varying degrees of anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, and at presentation can range from indolent to life threatening. The clinician should have a heightened level of suspicion when treating elderly patients and those with prior exposure to chemotherapy, radiation, and environmental toxins in the presence of unexplained cytopenias. Chronic anemia should not be considered a natural consequence of aging. Approximately 1 in 6 patients with unexplained anemia may have findings compatible with MDS, suggesting that MDS should be considered higher in the differential diagnosis. Primary care physicians are encouraged to conduct comprehensive evaluations to exclude non-MDS-related causes for persistent cytopenias. Patients with pancytopenia, bicytopenia, or any persistent and unexplained isolated cytopenia (and particularly unexplained macrocytic anemia) should be referred to a specialist to establish a diagnosis.

### Chronic neutrophilic leukemia 2014: update on diagnosis, molecular genetics, and management [^11536kLr]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

Disease Overview

Chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by sustained, mature neutrophilic leukocytosis, splenomegaly, and bone marrow granulocytic hyperplasia.

Diagnosis

Key diagnostic criteria include leukocytosis of > 25 × 10⁹/L (of which > 80% are neutrophils) with < 10% and < 1% circulating immature granulocytes and myeloblasts, respectively. There should be no dysplasia, monocytosis, molecular evidence of BCR-ABL1, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, or FGRF1 rearrangements and no identifiable cause for physiologic neutrophilia or, if present, demonstration of myeloid clonality. DEVELOPMENTS IN MOLECULAR GENETICS: Recently, CNL has been shown to be specifically driven by somatic activating mutations of CSF3R, most commonly CSF3R T618I. As such, the diagnosis of CNL will no longer be one of exclusion only, and revision of the current WHO classification is anticipated to include the molecular criterion of mutated CSF3R.

### Chronic neutrophilic leukaemia: an Egyptian case [^114pGPTe]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Chronic neutrophilic leukaemia (CNL) is a rare myeloproliferative disorder of elderly patients characterised by sustained neutrophilia. The diagnosis of CNL requires the exclusion of BCR/ABL positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia and leukemoid reaction. We present here a case of a 61-year-old Egyptian man with CNL and 21 months of follow-up. The main symptom of our patient was purpura. Splenomegaly, hepatomegaly and lymph node enlargement were not detected at presentation or throughout the patient's course. Thrombocytopenia was a considerable problem in our patient, causing recurrent bleeding and affecting the hydroxyurea dose adjustment. While hydroxyurea decreased the total leucocytic count, it could not affect the fatal course of the disease. The survival course of our patient extended to 21 months after presentation. The cause of death was attributed to disease progression.

### Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in the management of chronic neutrophilic leukemia [^116zdM79]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) is a rare myeloproliferative disorder characterized by a clonal proliferation of mainly mature neutrophils, which is often difficult to differentiate from reactive leukocytosis or other myeloproliferative disorders. Treatment to date has focused on disease control rather than cure. Once the disease has progressed to a more aggressive leukemia there is typically little chance of obtaining a long lasting remission due to the older age of most patients as well as the acquisition of multiple poor prognostic cytogenetic abnormalities. In this case report we describe a successful sibling allogeneic bone marrow transplant in a 60-year-old man with CNL performed while he was still in the stable phase of his disease. We propose that even in older patients this curative approach may be considered in selected patients at an early stage of their disease, similar to the approach taken with chronic myelogenous leukemia.

### Chronic neutrophilic leukemia: new science and new diagnostic criteria [^116WAyGY]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction: "An uncommon myeloproliferative disorder"

Chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) is a rare BCR - ABL negative myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) characterized by sustained, predominantly mature neutrophil proliferation, bone marrow granulocytic hyperplasia, and hepatosplenomegaly. It was first described by Tuohy in 1920 in a report entitled "A case of splenomegaly with polymorphonuclear neutrophil hyperleukocytosis", detailing the case of a 58-year-old woman presenting with splenomegaly and an associated "overwhelming preponderance of mature polymorphonuclear neutrophils". Subsequently, in 1932, Emil-Weil and Seereported two more possible cases from European literature. Over 30 years later, Jackson and Clark reported on a rare case of MPN, coining the term neutrophilic leukemia, but the inaugural use of the term "chronic neutrophilic leukemia" was finally attributed to Tanzer et al. in the Lancet in 1964and was re-iterated shortly thereafter by Rubin in the Annals of Internal Medicine in 1966. Importantly, and perhaps disappointingly, whether these accounts represent actual cases of CNL remains uncertain as literature were scant and diagnostic criteria virtually non-existent.

### Chronic appendicitis "syndrome" manifested by an appendicolith and thickened appendix presenting as chronic right lower abdominal pain in adults [^112QMjHh]. Emergency Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

In this short report, we describe a small series of adult patients with chronic appendicitis presenting with chronic right lower quadrant abdominal pain. The clinical presentation was unusual and atypical for classic appendicitis because of the absence of fever, peritoneal tenderness on focused graded compression of the abdomen, and leukocytosis. Computed tomography (CT) findings included the presence of an appendicolith and appendiceal thickening, without mesenteric infiltration, abscess, or collection. In this series, the appendicolith appeared to represent a marker rather than an actual cause of appendicitis. Focused CT scans with additional lung and bone windows proved optimal in detecting appendicoliths, which were not visible on the scout localizer scans, despite windowing modifications. Our findings suggest that chronic appendicitis may be a phenomenon unique to adults and should be included in the differential diagnosis of chronic right lower quadrant pain in patients seen in the emergency room setting. Surgery is curative in such patients, although expectant management is an alternative when tolerated by the patient.

A few have overlapping features, however, with evidence of morphologic dysplasia and a proliferative advantage of one or more of the myeloid differentiating cell lines. For practical purposes and therapeutic considerations, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia is viewed now as a composite disorder along with atypical chronic myeloid leukemia and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.

### Chronic neutrophilic leukaemia [^114aNesj]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic neutrophilic leukaemia (CNL) is a rare type of myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) characterised by sustained leucocytosis (≥ 25×10⁹/L) with neoplastic proliferation of neutrophilic granulocytes in blood and bone marrow. In contrast to chronic myeloid leukaemia, the disease primarily involves neutrophilic lineage with persistent proliferation of mature forms of neutrophils. No consistent cytogenetic changes have been reported. Known recurrent genetic changes in other MPNs such as JAK2, MPL, CALR, BCR-ABL1, PDGFRA, PDGFRB and FGFR1 are mostly absent. Recently, mutations in colony stimulating factor 3 receptor (CSF3R) have been reported in high frequency in CNL. This discovery has provided more insight into its pathogenesis and opened up possible treatment options. In this article, we review the clinical findings, morphology, pathobiology and differential diagnosis of CNL and treatment implications of CSF3R mutations.

### Monoclonal B lymphocytosis in the general population [^114FJZ6w]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2009). Low credibility.

Monoclonal B lymphocytosis (MBL) is a frequent phenomenon in the general population. Despite a phenotype similar to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the possibility exists that most cases are not necessarily a pre-leukemic condition. This is suggested by the fact that MBL is at least 100 times more frequent than CLL and the diagnosis of CLL is not an inevitable fate, even among MBL cases with lymphocytosis, where it occurs only in 1.1% of the cases per year. The high incidence of MBL, if coupled with the possibility of evolution into a frank leukemic state, poses evident clinical and health system concerns. MBL in the general population usually accounts for a very low number of all circulating B-cells, being < 10% of all B lymphocytes. This creates the need for a better characterisation of MBL at molecular level, aiming to identify biological features that may define which cases are more likely to progress towards clinically overt CLL. This approach should also help to avoid unnecessary and prolonged follow-ups in all individuals carrying MBL, excluding those who are extremely unlikely to develop CLL.

### How I diagnose and treat chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [^111aGcdv]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

How I manage patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia

The first step in the management of CMML patients is establishing an accurate diagnosis, followed by personalized risk stratification. Using any one of the molecularly integrated prognostic models, CMML patients can be stratified into lower risk and higher risk groups (Figure 4). Management strategies for these two risk groups are described below.

Lower-risk chronic myelomonocytic leukemia

I define lower-risk CMML patients as those who fall into low and intermediate-1 risk categories based on the MMM and the CPSS-Mol, or the low-risk category of the GFM model. On average these patients have a median overall survival of 60–100 months, and the following treatment strategies can be adopted for their care:

Figure 4.
Management algorithm for chronic myelomonocytic leukemia based on risk stratification using the Mayo Molecular Model (Patnaik MM et al. Leukemia 2014). CMML: chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, DNMTi: DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, X: new clinical trial investigational agent.

Observation and supportive care. Several low-risk patients can be observed without any CMML-directed therapies, with serial blood count measurements and management of symptoms as needed. There are some data to suggest that in pCMML, permissive leukocytosis/monocytosis can be associated with increased lysozyme levels and a higher prevalence of chronic kidney disease (lysozyme nephropathy), and in select asymptomatic pCMML patients with white blood cell counts > 30 × 10⁹/L, I do recommend hydroxyurea to control blood counts and proliferative features. Side effects associated with hydroxyurea include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, mouth sores, photosensitivity, myelosuppression, and chronic non-healing leg/ankle ulcers.

### Evaluation of patients with leukocytosis [^114QKP5w]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

An elevated white blood cell count has many potential etiologies, including malignant and nonmalignant causes. It is important to use age- and pregnancy-specific normal ranges for the white blood cell count. A repeat complete blood count with peripheral smear may provide helpful information, such as types and maturity of white blood cells, uniformity of white blood cells, and toxic granulations. The leukocyte differential may show eosinophilia in parasitic or allergic conditions, or it may reveal lymphocytosis in childhood viral illnesses. Leukocytosis is a common sign of infection, particularly bacterial, and should prompt physicians to identify other signs and symptoms of infection. The peripheral white blood cell count can double within hours after certain stimuli because of the large bone marrow storage and intravascularly marginated pools of neutrophils. Stressors capable of causing an acute leukocytosis include surgery, exercise, trauma, and emotional stress. Other nonmalignant etiologies of leukocytosis include certain medications, asplenia, smoking, obesity, and chronic inflammatory conditions. Symptoms suggestive of a hematologic malignancy include fever, weight loss, bruising, or fatigue. If malignancy cannot be excluded or another more likely cause is not suspected, referral to a hematologist/oncologist is indicated.

### Failure to normalize lymphopenia following trauma is associated with increased mortality, independent of the leukocytosis pattern [^1138RYyP]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

Trauma remains the 5 th leading cause of death in the United States, and is rapidly been understood as a leading cause of both mortality and significant morbidity world-wide. Devastating head injury and non-salvageable blood loss remain the leading causes of death in early time points following admission for trauma. Easily measurable and trackable parameters are essential to aid clinicians to appreciate the degree of stress and SIRS response in critically ill and injured patients following poly-trauma, shock and subsequent organ dysfunction.

The leukocytosis response following trauma is well described. A SIRS response comprises of leukocytosis which rapidly returns to normal over the initial 3 days. The neutrophil pattern is also well recognized and they clearly play an important role in the response to tissue injury. It is well recognized that a perpetuation of the SIRS response is associated with worse outcomes, specifically as they relate to infectious complications, in trauma patients.

Several animal models have shown either lymphocyte loss or lymphocyte dysfunction following various models of injury, namely acute lung injury, sepsis or burns. Lymphocytes, separate from the other components of the leukocyte population, have been demonstrated to be direct contributors to acute lung injury. Lymphocytic anergy has been seen in humans following both trauma and sepsis. However, there is a paucity of human data in the literature addressing the impact of lymphocyte fluctuations and the progression of lymphocyte numbers in the early phase following trauma as it relates to mortality. We believe that our work adds clinical evidence confirming the murine data.

To best assess the effects of trauma on the inflammatory response, we chose patients who were most likely to have sustained an inflammatory response, namely patients with moderate to severe injuries as denoted by an Injury Severity Score of ≥ 15. To minimize the effects of those early deaths, we excluded patients with an ISS of 75 (non-survivable) and included only patients who survived at least 3 days.

### Chronic myelogenous leukemia, BCR-ABL1 + [^1144EjWL]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

Session 1 of the 2007 Workshop of the Society for Hematopathology/European Association for Haematopathology focused on chronic myelogenous leukemia, BCR-ABL1+ (CML). CML is a myeloproliferative neoplasm arising at the level of a pluripotent stem cell and consistently associated with the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene. CML most commonly manifests in a chronic phase of the disease with neutrophilic leukocytosis, and the demonstration of the Philadelphia chromosome is the ultimate confirmation of the diagnosis. However, in select cases, the initial diagnosis remains challenging, and a number of issues pertaining to the manifestations and disease evolution remain unresolved. These issues have been illustrated by the cases submitted to our workshop and include unusual manifestations of CML, including manifestation in the accelerated and/or blast phase, and patterns of disease progression and therapy resistance in the era of protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy.

### Too many white cells-TAM, JMML, or something else? [^113t2AxK]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Leukocytosis is a common finding in pediatric patients, and the differential diagnosis can be broad, including benign reactive leukocytosis and malignant myeloproliferative disorders. Transient abnormal myelopoiesis is a myeloproliferative disorder that occurs in young infants with constitutional trisomy 21 and somatic GATA1 mutations. Most patients are observed, but outcomes span the spectrum from spontaneous resolution to life-threatening complications. Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia is a highly aggressive myeloproliferative disorder associated with altered RAS-pathway signaling that occurs in infants and young children. Treatment typically involves hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, but certain patients can be observed. Early recognition of these and other myeloproliferative disorders is important and requires a clinician to be aware of these diagnoses and have a clear understanding of their presentations. This paper discusses the presentation and evaluation of leukocytosis when myeloproliferative disorders are part of the differential and reviews different concepts regarding treatment strategies.

Fluphenazine Decanoate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

Leukopenia, Neutropenia and Agranulocytosis

In clinical trial and postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia/neutropenia and agranulocytosis have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents.

Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a pre-existing low WBC or a history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and should discontinue Fluphenazine Decanoate Injection at the first sign of a decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors.

Patients with neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1,000/mm³) should discontinue Fluphenazine Decanoate Injection and have their WBC followed until recovery.

Information for Patients

Given the likelihood that a substantial proportion of patients exposed chronically to neuroleptics will develop tardive dyskinesia, it is advised that all patients in whom chronic use is contemplated be given, if possible, full information about this risk. The decision to inform patients and/or their guardians must obviously take into account the clinical circumstances and the competency of the patient to understand the information provided.

### Evaluation of liver enzymes in asymptomatic chronic hepatitis B virus infected pregnant women [^111Zev2E]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

The physiologic leukocytosis of pregnancy represents a well known phenomenon, described early on by Rudolf Virchow, that has been very well documented and studied quantitatively. There are also reports that present leukocytosis with marked left shift in the myeloid-neutrophilic lineage during the third trimester of normal uncomplicated pregnancy that normalized readily after delivery. It has been reported that the elevated circulating levels of progesterone, especially during the late second and third trimester of pregnancy results in the increased numbers of circulating neutrophils while decreasing lymphocyte proportions, a phenomenon frequently observed in normal pregnancy. Moreover, it has been reported that pregnant women exhibit lower lymphocyte counts than non-pregnant women. Lymphocyte proliferation and activation is a well known phenomenon in patients with viral infections. Recent studies revealed that endogenous factors, such as regulatory T cells, immunosuppressive cytokines, and inhibitory receptors contribute to the impairment of virus-specific T cell responses in chronic HBV infection, perhaps reflecting the host's attempt to protect itself against immune-mediated pathology in a subset of patients. Viremic pregnant women of our study population, exhibited significantly lower absolute numbers of white blood cells and neutrophil counts and significantly higher ALT and GGT values, compared to non-viremic women. Moreover, we observed that the absolute neutrophil count of pregnant women was the only predictor of viremia among HBeAg negative chronic HBV-infected women (the lower the absolute neutrophils count the higher the possibility of detectable viremia). It seems that the presence of viremia affects the well known pregnancy-induced leukocytosis as well as the left shift in the myeloid-neutrophilic lineage. The absolute lymphocyte count in viremic chronic HBV-infected pregnant women was higher than the corresponding count in non-viremic ones (2.088 vs. 1.727 respectively, P = 0.808), although not significant, probably because of the major effect of pregnancy per se in the absolute neutrophil count. This finding needs further investigation in large-scale studies.

### Clonal monocytosis of renal significance [^1149Bnuk]. Kidney International (2024). Medium credibility.

Clonal monocytosis reflects a preneoplastic or neoplastic sustained increase in the absolute monocyte count in the absence of reactive causes. Causes of clonal monocytosis include clonal cytopenias with monocytosis and acute and chronic myeloid neoplasms. Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia is a prototypical myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative overlap neoplasm in adults, characterized by sustained peripheral blood monocytosis. Kidney abnormalities, including acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease, are frequent in patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and are predictors of worse outcomes. In addition, acute kidney injury/chronic kidney disease often limits eligibility for allogeneic stem cell transplantation or enrollment in clinical trials. In this review, we highlight clonal monocytosis-related etiologies that give rise to acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease, with special emphasis on chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and lysozyme-induced nephropathy. Monocytes produce lysozyme, which, in excess, can accumulate in and damage the proximal renal tubular epithelium. Early identification of this etiology and a timely reduction in monocyte counts can salvage kidney function. Other etiologies of kidney injury associated with clonal monocytosis include direct renal infiltration by monocytes, renal extramedullary hematopoiesis, myeloproliferative neoplasm-associated glomerulopathy, autoimmune (membranous nephropathy, minimal change disease) and paraneoplastic manifestations, thrombotic microangiopathy, obstructive nephropathy due to myeloproliferation, and urate nephropathy due to tumor lysis syndrome. We propose to group these mechanistic etiologies of kidney injury as clonal monocytosis of renal significance and provide guidance on their diagnosis and management.

### Hematopoietic stem cells in wound healing response [^116DTmUL]. Advances in Wound Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion and Future Direction

We discussed the potential roles for HSPCs in wound healing responses with a focus on myelopoiesis. HSPCs participate in healing responses by quickly generating myeloid cells on demand, which in turn accumulate in the wound tissue. How quickly HSPCs generate myeloid cells determines the quality of acute inflammation (successful elimination of damaged tissues or infectious agents), which in turn leads to initiation of resolution and regenerative/healing processes.

Conditions with chronic inflammation — obesity, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerosis, aging, stress, and perhaps pre-existence of chronic wounds, are associated with immune dysregulation, and recent evidence highlight such dysregulations detected at an HSPC level through a cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic mechanisms. There are two features of HSPC dysfunction in conditions with chronic inflammation. The first is chronic activation and myeloid skewing. We see this as leukocytosis in the steady state, and leukocytosis is indeed recognized as a risk of additional conditions. The second feature is the slow or insufficient reactivity to additional insults such as wounds, injury, organ damage, and infection. Importantly, the low reactivity subsequently leads to prolonged activation of HSPCs, which in turn results in nonresolution and nonhealing (Fig. 6). Whether insufficient reactivity and prolonged activation of HSPCs is programmed in HSPCs will be a topic of discussion. Thus, epigenetic reprogramming in chronic conditions and the niche remodeling that can perpetuate the HSPC dysfunction are under investigation.

Figure 6.
Myelopoiesis and HSPC activation in the healthy and in conditions with chronic inflammation. In the healthy, tissue injury can induce emergency or demand-activated myelopoiesis through activation of quiescent HSCs, resulting in reactive myelopoiesis and mobilization of effector immune cells such as neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes, which typically seen in the early phase (approximately day 2). This phase is followed by timely limitation of myelopoiesis and activated HSPCs, which in turn promotes resolution of inflammation and healing. In contrast, in conditions with chronic inflammation, HSPCs are activated in a basal condition (often seen as myeloid skewing with MyP expansion). However, these activated HSPCs lack reactivity and fail quickly enough to mobilize innate immune cells, leading to nonresolution and nonhealing with sustained HSPC activation.

### The risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among individuals with monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis [^111CCmwR]. Blood Cancer Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the underlying cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is a novel coronavirus that has caused a global pandemic, with more than 84 million cases and over 1 million deaths reported in the United States (US). Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are at particularly high risk for developing the severe disease when infected by SARS-CoV-2. This increased risk is thought to be secondary to a dysregulated immune system inherently associated with CLL, in addition to CLL treatments that can further exacerbate immunosuppression and blunt response to vaccination. In two large retrospective series of CLL patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, the case fatality rate was 35%; patients with previously untreated CLL and those on active treatment had similar outcomes. Monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis (MBL), a precursor condition to CLL, is defined as an absolute clonal B cell count of < 5 × 10⁹/L, in the absence of lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and cytopenias. MBL is one of the most common pre-malignant conditions in humans, affecting approximately 5–10% of adults over the age of 40 years. MBL can be further subdivided into low-count MBL (typically identified through screening and defined by an absolute B-cell count < 0.5 × 10⁹/L) and high-count MBL with absolute B cell count 0.5–4.9 × 10⁹/L (typically identified in the clinic). Recent data indicate that both low- and high-count MBL are at high risk of developing serious infections requiring hospitalization relative to healthy individuals without MBL, suggesting that immune dysfunction in CLL develops early during B cell leukemogenesis. To our knowledge, there are no studies examining the risk of COVID-19 infection in MBL.

### Elevation in white blood cell count after corticosteroid use in noninfected hospitalized patients [^116KK8hJ]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Corticosteroids are an essential inpatient treatment of many inflammatory and auto‐immune conditions. While integral to effective treatment, they also have a wide range of side effects, including immune suppression. While on steroids, patients must be closely monitored for complications such as infection.

It is well‐established that corticosteroids cause leukocytosis. Often in clinical practice, physicians confronting leukocytosis must decide if it indicates infection or simply reflects steroid use. In making this decision, physicians should be aware of the expected increase in white blood cells (WBCs) due to steroids.

Existing studies of the WBC response to corticosteroids have been limited by small sample sizes and specialized patient populations (e.g. acute infection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]), and have ignored the impact of multiple doses. While they have established that corticosteroids increase WBC count, largely due to neutrophilia, the observed responses are highly variable in both magnitude and timing across doses and populations. To date, there are no large‐scale studies that examine the response by dose and timing of corticosteroids. Additionally, while studies have considered glucocorticoids and leukocytosis in acute infection, there have been no studies of noninfected patients. Such a study is necessary to define the WBC increase attributable to corticosteroids alone. Presumably, increases in WBC greater than this should raise suspicion for infection or other pathology.

Using data from a single, large health system, we aimed to quantify the WBC response to corticosteroids in noninfected patients stratified by dose and observed for up to 4 days of treatment. Our goal is to help clinicians delineate the expected rise in WBC from corticosteroids to help identify potential infections.

### Why does my patient have leukocytosis? [^113Y9xBJ]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Leukocytosis is one of the most common laboratory abnormalities in medicine, and one of the most frequent reasons for hematologic consultation. Effective evaluation of leukocytosis requires an attentive history, careful physical examination, meticulous review of the complete blood count and peripheral blood smear, judicious application of laboratory and radiologic testing, and thoughtful analysis. Definitive diagnosis may require bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, imaging studies, and specialized molecular tests. The differential diagnosis of leukocytosis includes physiologic responses to a broad range of infectious and inflammatory processes, as well as numerous primary hematologic disorders such as leukemias, lymphomas, and myeloproliferative neoplasms.

### Monocytosis and its association with clonal hematopoiesis in community-dwelling individuals [^115jwtrh]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Monocytes are part of the myeloid lineage that expands with age and represent key players in inflammatory and immune reactions. Normal monocyte values range between 0.3 and 0.9 × 10⁹/L, constituting 2% to 8% of the total white blood cell (WBC) population in peripheral blood (PB). Abnormal production and accumulation of monocytes may occur in numerous conditions. Monocytosis may be explained by inflammatory conditions ("reactive monocytosis"), as present in acute stress, myocardial infarction, chronic infection, systemic inflammation, and autoimmune disorders. Besides secondary causes, PB monocytosis is the defining phenotypic hallmark of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), a chronic myeloid neoplasm with both myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative features that occurs almost exclusively in older individuals. In addition, monocytosis may accompany other myeloid malignancies. Current World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for CMML define monocytosis as a persistent (≥ 3 months) increase in PB monocyte counts ≥ 1 × 10⁹/L in combination with a relative excess of monocytes comprising ≥ 10% of the WBC count that cannot be explained by secondary causes. Driver gene mutations are detected in the majority of patients with CMML and most frequently involve SRSF2, TET2, and ASXL1 genes, although none of these are CMML-specific. In current WHO criteria, clonal genetic lesions in the presence of unexplained, persistent monocytosis can support a diagnosis of CMML, even in the absence of typical myelodysplastic and/or myeloproliferative features.

PRECAUTIONS

Leukopenia, Neutropenia and Agranulocytosis

In clinical trial and postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia/neutropenia and agranulocytosis have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents.

Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include preexisting low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a preexisting low WBC or a history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and should discontinue chlorpromazine hydrochloride tablets at the first sign of a decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors.

Patients with neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mm³) should discontinue chlorpromazine hydrochloride tablets and have their WBC followed until recovery.

General

Given the likelihood that some patients exposed chronically to antipsychotics will develop tardive dyskinesia, it is advised that all patients in whom chronic use is contemplated be given, if possible, full information about this risk. The decision to inform patients and/or their guardians must obviously take into account the clinical circumstances and the competency of the patient to understand the information provided.

Chlorpromazine should be administered cautiously to persons with cardiovascular, liver or renal disease. There is evidence that patients with a history of hepatic encephalopathy due to cirrhosis have increased sensitivity to the CNS effects of chlorpromazine (i.e., impaired cerebration and abnormal slowing of the EEG).

Because of its CNS depressant effect, chlorpromazine should be used with caution in patients with chronic respiratory disorders such as severe asthma, emphysema and acute respiratory infections, particularly in children (1 to 12 years of age).

Because chlorpromazine can suppress the cough reflex, aspiration of vomitus is possible.

Chlorpromazine prolongs and intensifies the action of CNS depressants such as anesthetics, barbiturates and narcotics. When chlorpromazine is administered concomitantly, about ¼ to ½ the usual dosage of such agents is required. When chlorpromazine is not being administered to reduce requirements of CNS depressants, it is best to stop such depressants before starting chlorpromazine treatment. These agents may subsequently be reinstated at low doses and increased as needed.

### Always stressed but never exhausted: how stem cells in myeloid neoplasms avoid extinction in inflammatory conditions [^112YrwMc]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Human hematopoiesis generates ∼10⁸ leukocytes, 2 × 10⁸ erythrocytes, and 10¹¹ platelets daily to support oxygen transport, hemostasis, and immune response. Demand for mature hematopoietic cells can increase suddenly because of injury or infection, necessitating a system with large spare capacity and high regenerative potential. To address this challenge, complex regulatory networks maintain balance between quiescence, proliferation, self-renewal, and differentiation. Mouse data suggest that chronic inflammation or recurrent episodes of acute inflammation can exhaust the hematopoietic system's regenerative capacity prematurely and compromise its function. In humans, chronic inflammation can aggravate cytopenias in inherited bone marrow failure (BMF) syndromes, suggesting that inflammation may contribute to BMF. The opposite seems to apply in myeloid malignancies and their precursor clonal hematopoiesis (CH; the presence of bona fide driver mutations in the blood or BM of people without obvious hematologic abnormalities). Starting with our initial observations, a large body of data has accumulated to implicate inflammation as a critical progression driver in myeloid malignancies, particularly myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), raising the question of how malignant clones avoid attrition in highly inflammatory environments. Here, we review the mechanisms that protect normal hematopoiesis from exhaustion under inflammatory stress, drawing parallels between chronic inflammation and continuously increased proliferation in MPNs. This is followed by an in-depth discussion of dormancy as a crucial mechanism to preserve hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) under stress, considering the possible role of stochastic effects. We then cover how myeloid malignancies co-opt physiological mechanisms to avoid extinction, illustrating general principles with selected examples. Lastly, we review emerging clinical implications and potential therapeutic strategies.

### Failure to normalize lymphopenia following trauma is associated with increased mortality, independent of the leukocytosis pattern [^115GGkR7]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Rather than just passive bystanders in the inflammatory and immune response to trauma, lymphocytes play a critical key role in the proper modulation of the inflammatory response, and the lymphopenia seen is a consumption and activation of these cells. A perpetuation of this lymphocyte loss generally reflects cellular exhaustion, desensitization and down-regulation of the lymphocytes, and specifically certain subsets. This exhaustion of the lymphocytic response may explain why patients who fail to recover their lymphopenia following trauma have the lowest associated survival (73% versus 83%).

Interestingly, patients who did not display any component of the typical response, namely never lymphopenic, had both the shortest time to death among those who died, as well as the shortest time to discharge among survivors. A lack of immune fluctuations may allow patients to rapidly recover from the traumatic injuries that do not require prolonged in-hospital treatment, and thus resolve their inflammation and be suitable for early discharge. Patients who have ongoing stress and need for in-hospital treatments they may fail to have a robust immune response to tolerate the ongoing management of the traumatic injuries. This may reflect the concept that some inflammatory response is beneficial, but no immune response is detrimental. Moderately and severely injured trauma patients often have ongoing stress responses due to either repeat operative intervention due to cumulative nature of their injuries, or due to 2 nd hit phenonomena such as infection. We believe that this dampened inflammatory response (never lymphopenic) reflects an inability to display an appropriate inflammatory response (due to lymphocyte exhaustion) in relation to ongoing stress. Tracking the immune response, and particularly the lymphocyte profile over the early course of a patients stay, namely the first 4 days, may allow us to predict which patients may not survive these 2 nd hit episodes.

Regarding medical management for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, more specifically with respect to indications for treatment, iwCLL 2018 guidelines recommend to initiate therapy in patients with CLL in whom active disease is clearly documented and at least 1 of the following criteria are met:

- evidence of progressive marrow failure as manifested by the development of, or worsening of, anemia and/or thrombocytopenia. Cutoff levels of hemoglobin < 10 g/dL or platelet counts < 100×10⁹/L are generally regarded as indication for treatment. However, in some patients, platelet counts < 100×10⁹/L may remain stable over a long period; this situation does not automatically require therapeutic intervention

- massive, such as ≥ 6 cm below the left costal margin, or progressive or symptomatic splenomegaly

- massive nodes ≥ 10 cm in longest diameter, or progressive or symptomatic lymphadenopathy

- progressive lymphocytosis with an increase of ≥ 50% over a 2-month period, or lymphocyte doubling time < 6 months. Exclude factors contributing to lymphocytosis other than CLL

- autoimmune complications including anemia or thrombocytopenia poorly responsive to corticosteroids

- symptomatic or functional extranodal involvement

- **Disease-related symptoms as defined by any of the following**:

- unintentional weight loss ≥ 10% within the previous 6 months

- significant fatigue

- fevers ≥ 100.5 °F or 38.0 °C for ≥ 2 weeks without evidence of infection

- night sweats for ≥ 1 month without evidence of infection.

### Malignant or benign leukocytosis [^111xbocB]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Leukocytosis, or elevated WBC count, is a commonly encountered laboratory finding. Distinguishing malignant from benign leukocytosis is a critical step in the care of a patient, which initiates a vastly different decision tree. Confirmation of the complete blood cell count and the WBC differential is the first step. Examination of the PB smear is essential to confirming the automated blood cell differential or affirming the manual differential performed on the PB smear. Next is separation of the leukocytosis into a myeloid versus a lymphoid process. Distinguishing a reactive lymphoid proliferation from a lymphoproliferative disorder requires examination of lymphocyte morphology for pleomorphic lymphocytes versus a monomorphic population, with the latter favoring a lymphoproliferative neoplasm. Samples suspicious for lymphoproliferative disorders can be confirmed and characterized by flow cytometry, with molecular studies initiated in select cases; precursor lymphoid neoplasms (lymphoblasts) should trigger a BM examination. Myeloid leukocytosis triggers a differential diagnosis of myeloid leukemoid reactions versus myeloid malignancies. The manual differential is key, along with correct enumeration of blasts and blast equivalents, immature granulocytes, basophils, and eosinophils and identifying dysplasia to identify myeloid malignancies. Confirmation and characterization of myeloid malignancies should be performed with a BM examination and the appropriate ancillary studies. Myeloid leukemoid reactions commonly result from infections and show activated neutrophil changes on morphology; these should prompt evaluation for infection. Other causes of reactive myeloid leukocytoses are also discussed herein.

Pathological features and differential diagnoses: the role of the pathologist in making the diagnosis

The morphological features of PLR can be identical to features seen in LRs due to other causes, such as infection. They can also be very similar to findings seen in patients being treated with exogenous haematopoietic growth factors (EHGFs), which are commonly used to shorten the period of neutropaenia after myeloablative chemotherapy. Besides causing LR, EHGFs can also lead to a transient increase in peripheral blood blasts count (up to 39% in one study). This can mimic acute leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome with excess blast. The use of EHGFs is the most common cause of extreme leukocytosis in patients with non-haematolymphoid malignancies, according to a study done on 758 patients. In this study, the aetiology of extreme leukocytosis was due to EHGFs in 69% of patients, followed by infection (15%), and lastly PLR (10%). Therefore, before entertaining a diagnosis of PLR, the use of EHGFs must be first excluded.

PLR can present in a similar way to MPNs. Therefore, it is not uncommon for the pathologist to encounter a peripheral blood smear or a bone marrow biopsy from one of these patients. The main differential diagnoses for a LR are as follows: chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) and chronic neutrophilic leukaemia (CNL).CNL is much rarer than CML or CMML. Distinguishing the LR from a MPN is the most essential step in reaching the correct diagnosis. The role of the pathologist goes beyond reporting the absence of a haematological malignancy. In addition, he or she must alert the treating physician by pointing out to the possibility of an occult CST.

Peripheral blood findings

Most PLRs are neutrophilic predominant, although eosinophilic PLRs or mixed neutrophilic–eosinophilic PLRs have been also reported. Blood smears from patients with PLR (figures 1 and 2) show neutrophilia with marked left shift due to increased late granulocytic precursors (band forms, metamyelocytes and myelocytes). Characteristic features of reactive granulocytosis include toxic granulation, prominent Döhle bodies and cytoplasmic vacuolation.

### A unique clonal JAK2 mutation leading to constitutive signalling causes polycythaemia vera [^113hgCC9]. Nature (2005). Excellent credibility.

Myeloproliferative disorders are clonal haematopoietic stem cell malignancies characterized by independency or hypersensitivity of haematopoietic progenitors to numerous cytokines. The molecular basis of most myeloproliferative disorders is unknown. On the basis of the model of chronic myeloid leukaemia, it is expected that a constitutive tyrosine kinase activity could be at the origin of these diseases. Polycythaemia vera is an acquired myeloproliferative disorder, characterized by the presence of polycythaemia diversely associated with thrombocytosis, leukocytosis and splenomegaly. Polycythaemia vera progenitors are hypersensitive to erythropoietin and other cytokines. Here, we describe a clonal and recurrent mutation in the JH2 pseudo-kinase domain of the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene in most (> 80%) polycythaemia vera patients. The mutation, a valine-to-phenylalanine substitution at amino acid position 617, leads to constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation activity that promotes cytokine hypersensitivity and induces erythrocytosis in a mouse model. As this mutation is also found in other myeloproliferative disorders, this unique mutation will permit a new molecular classification of these disorders and novel therapeutical approaches.

### Low-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis persists after seven years of follow up and is associated with a poorer outcome [^114Cs8h5]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Low-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis is defined by the presence of very low numbers of circulating clonal B cells, usually phenotypically similar to chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, whose biological and clinical significance remains elusive. Herein, we re-evaluated 65/91 low-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis cases (54 chronic lymphocytic leukemia-like and 11 non-chronic lymphocytic leukemia-like) followed-up for a median of seven years, using high-sensitivity flow cytometry and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization. Overall, the clone size significantly increased in 69% of low-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis cases, but only one subject progressed to high-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis. In parallel, the frequency of cytogenetic alterations increased over time (32% vs 61% of cases, respectively). The absolute number of the major T-cell and natural killer cell populations also increased, but only among chronic lymphocytic leukemia-like cases with increased clone size vs age- and sex-matched controls. Although progression to chronic lymphocytic leukemia was not observed, the overall survival of low-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis individuals was significantly reduced vs non-monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis controls (P = 0.03) plus the general population from the same region (P ≤ 0.001), particularly among females (P = 0.01); infection and cancer were the main causes of death in low-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis. In summary, despite the fact that mid-term progression from low-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis to high-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis and chronic lymphocytic leukemia appears to be unlikely, these clones persist at increased numbers, usually carrying more genetic alterations, and might thus be a marker of an impaired immune system indirectly associated with a poorer outcome, particularly among females.

### Leukocytosis and ischemic vascular disease morbidity and mortality: is it time to intervene? [^114rrB4Q]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2005). Low credibility.

The association between leukocytosis and increased morbidity and mortality of ischemic vascular disease has been observed for more than half a century, and recent studies in > 350,000 patients confirm the robustness of the association and the dramatically higher relative and absolute acute and chronic mortality rates in patients with high versus low leukocyte counts. Although there is reason to believe that the association is not causal (that is, that leukocytosis is simply a marker of inflammation), there is also reason to believe that the leukocytosis directly enhances acute thrombosis and chronic atherosclerosis. Leukocytosis also is associated with poor prognosis and vaso-occlusive events in patients with sickle cell disease, and experimental data suggest a direct role for leukocytes in microvascular obstruction. The only way to test whether leukocytes contribute directly to poor outcome in ischemic cardiovascular disease is to assess the effect of modifying leukocyte function or number. Because selective blockade of leukocyte integrin alphaMbeta2 and P-selectin have thus far been disappointing as therapeutic strategies in human cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, I discuss the potential risks and benefits of short-term treatment with hydroxyurea to decrease the leukocyte count in select populations of patients at the highest risk of short-term death.

### Hyperleukocytosis and leukostasis in acute and chronic leukemias [^111NWt4g]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2022). Medium credibility.

Leukostasis is a life-threatening complication of high concentrations of circulating leukemic cells, most often myeloblasts. Effective care of patients with leukostasis involves early recognition and treatment, and aggressive management of concurrent complications of the underlying leukemia. The relatively poor prognosis in patients with leukostasis underscores the importance of the timely and effective care of this hematologic emergency. While cytoreductive measures such as hydroxyurea, corticosteroids, intravenous chemotherapy, and leukapheresis are available to urgently reduce high cell counts, characterization of the leukemia and initiation of tailored, definitive treatment is a parallel priority. However, data supporting any specific cytoreductive approach are limited, making clinical practice guided primarily by expert opinion. In this review, we discuss the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of leukemic hyperleukocytosis and leukostasis, with an emphasis on how to acutely manage this oncologic emergency in patients with acute myeloid leukemia, which is the most common cause of symptomatic leukostasis.

Conclusion

Despite significant advances in treating septic patients, this disease continues to be associated with high mortality rates and high long-term cognitive dysfunction. Extensive research in the area is being performed to validate biomarkers, facilitate sepsis diagnosis, and allow an early intervention that, although primarily supportive, can reduce the risk of death. Sepsis sometimes shows a hyperinflammatory response pattern and may be followed by an immunosuppressive phase, during which multiple organ dysfunction is present. A biomarker or a panel of biomarkers could be a new avenue to predict, identify, or provide new approaches to treat sepsis.

### Estimations of a degree of steroid induced leukocytosis in patients with acute infections [^1177eRqN]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Glucocorticosteroids (GCS) are known to cause the hematologic effect of leukocytosis and neutrophilia. Leukocytosis is a key parameter in establishing the diagnosis of sepsis and in the estimation of its severity.

Objective

To quantify the effect of chronic or acute GCS treatment on the level of leukocytosis in patients with acute infectious process.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with an acute infection hospitalized in tertiary medical center between the years 2003–2014. Patients were classified into three categories: chronic GCS treatment, acute GCS treatment, no GCS treatment. The primary outcome was the maximal WBC count within the first 24h from admission.

Results

We identified 5468 patients with acute infection: 333 of them with chronic GCS treatment, 213 with acute GCS treatment and 4922 with no GCS treatment. The overall maximal leukocytes count was higher in GCS therapy groups: 15.4 ± 8.3×10 9 /L for the acute GCS treatment, 14.9 ± 7.4×10 9 /L for chronic GCS treatment and 12.9 ± 6.4×10 9 /L for the no GCS group (P < 0.001).

Conclusion

In patients with acute infections chronically treated with GCS, an increase in the WBC is at average of 5×10 9 /L. These data must be taken into consideration while using the level of leukocytosis as a parameter in the diagnosis of the infectious process.
