## Question

What to do for thyroid nodule benign

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what to do for a benign thyroid nodule. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming that the nodule is truly benign and what that means for risk. Then, I should verify the initial follow-up strategy and timing. Next, I will consider when to repeat ultrasound or repeat FNA, including growth thresholds and sonographic changes. After that, I need to check indications for intervention, including surgery and minimally invasive options. I should also review what not to do, like routine TSH suppression. Finally, I will tailor recommendations to special populations and synthesize a practical, risk-stratified plan with clear intervals and triggers for action.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and its implications. A cytologically benign nodule on FNA carries a very low malignancy risk, typically around 1% in expert hands, and this risk drops further with a second benign FNA, which supports a conservative surveillance approach rather than immediate intervention [^d606ce46] [^0903d317] [^06559de6]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should also anchor this to ultrasound risk features, because high-suspicion sonographic patterns carry a higher false-negative risk and warrant closer follow-up even with benign cytology [^b5ee6a51].

> Next, I should review the initial follow-up plan. For an asymptomatic, cytologically benign nodule, routine ultrasound surveillance at 12 to 24 months is reasonable, with clinical assessment and TSH if indicated, and if stable, extending intervals thereafter. This balances the low false-negative risk against the costs and anxiety of overly frequent imaging [^b5ee6a51] [^ba340f58] [^22279560]. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence; these are largely consensus recommendations with moderate-quality support, which aligns with real-world practice patterns and the low event rate in longitudinal cohorts [^b5ee6a51] [^ba340f58].

> I will now examine when to repeat ultrasound or repeat FNA. Growth defined as a 20% increase in at least two dimensions with a minimal increase of 2 mm, or more than a 50% increase in volume, should prompt consideration of repeat FNA or continued observation depending on clinical context and ultrasound features, while new suspicious sonographic changes should lower the threshold for repeat FNA even without meeting strict growth criteria [^b5ee6a51] [^b398452e]. Hold on, I should verify the false-negative risk in larger nodules; nodules larger than 4 cm have a slightly higher false-negative rate and may justify a lower threshold for repeat FNA or surgical consultation despite benign cytology, especially if solid [^3bf73e3d] [^10c531ff].

> Let me consider indications for intervention. Surgery is not routine for benign nodules but is appropriate for significant compressive symptoms such as dysphagia, dyspnea, hoarseness, or cosmetic deformity, and for large nodules, typically greater than 4 cm, particularly if solid or growing, where the false-negative risk and patient burden may outweigh the risks of surgery [^180d718c] [^b398452e] [^e2f423d9]. I should double-check the extent of surgery; for a solitary benign nodule, lobectomy plus isthmectomy is generally preferred to minimize morbidity, reserving total thyroidectomy for multinodular goiters or specific anatomic considerations [^7db58c12].

> But wait, what if the patient prefers to avoid surgery or is high risk for anesthesia? Minimally invasive options such as radiofrequency ablation or percutaneous ethanol injection for predominantly cystic lesions can reduce size and symptoms with favorable safety profiles when performed by trained operators; patient selection and counseling are critical, and two benign cytology results are often recommended before ablation to mitigate the risk of treating occult malignancy [^59a49b1a] [^83bb3bf5] [^282f9edd]. Let me reconsider the role of ethanol; for recurrent cystic nodules, PEI remains first-line and can be highly effective, whereas thermal ablation is better suited for solid or mixed symptomatic benign nodules [^0b7b389a] [^fde7a9a7].

> I need to ensure I address what not to do. Routine TSH suppression with levothyroxine is not recommended for cytologically benign nodules in iodine-sufficient populations because benefits are modest at best and outweighed by risks such as atrial fibrillation and bone loss; if considered at all, it should be reserved for carefully selected cases with clear growth dynamics and close monitoring, and even then the evidence is limited [^8d63b40c] [^5879cf1f] [^e45ecb2a]. Hold on, I should verify whether any guideline endorses suppression here; both ATA and AACE/ACE/AME advise against routine suppressive therapy for benign nodules, which reinforces avoiding this practice [^8d63b40c] [^5879cf1f].

> Next, I should review special populations. In pregnancy, benign nodules generally do not require special surveillance beyond standard ultrasound intervals, and suppressive therapy is not recommended; if a nodule grows rapidly or develops suspicious features, repeat FNA can be considered, but surgery is typically deferred unless there is compelling evidence of malignancy or severe compressive symptoms [^baa73f59] [^a3db901f]. For children and adolescents, benign nodules are managed similarly with ultrasound surveillance, but larger nodules, particularly over 4 cm, carry a higher concern and may warrant surgical consultation even with benign cytology, with lobectomy preferred when surgery is indicated [^3bf73e3d].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified plan. For low-risk, asymptomatic, cytologically benign nodules under 4 cm with reassuring ultrasound features, ultrasound surveillance at 12 to 24 months, extending to 24 to 36 months if stable, is appropriate. For high-risk ultrasound patterns or nodules larger than 4 cm, consider shorter intervals and a lower threshold for repeat FNA or surgical consultation. For symptomatic nodules or those with documented growth meeting defined thresholds, discuss intervention options including surgery or ablation using shared decision-making that incorporates patient preferences, comorbidities, and local expertise [^b5ee6a51] [^b398452e] [^59a49b1a]. I should confirm that this aligns with contemporary reviews emphasizing individualized, risk-based care to avoid overdiagnosis and overtreatment while maintaining vigilance for the small subset that will require definitive therapy [^97cc750a] [^3654f39b].

For a benign thyroid nodule, **no immediate treatment is needed** [^a9f8814f]; most are managed with **watchful waiting** and periodic ultrasound [^b5ee6a51] to monitor for growth or suspicious changes [^ba340f58]. Surgery is reserved for nodules that are **large (> 4 cm)**, growing, or causing compressive symptoms (dysphagia, dyspnea, hoarseness) [^180d718c] [^e2f423d9]. TSH suppression with levothyroxine is **not recommended** [^8d63b40c] due to limited benefit and potential harms [^e45ecb2a]. If a nodule grows by > 50% in volume or develops suspicious features, repeat FNA is advised [^ba340f58] [^b5ee6a51]. Minimally invasive options (radiofrequency or ethanol ablation) can be considered for symptomatic or cosmetically concerning nodules when surgery is undesirable [^59a49b1a] [^282f9edd].

---

## Initial evaluation and confirmation of benignity

- **Ultrasound (US)**: Essential to characterize nodule size, composition, and features; guides follow-up [^3654f39b] [^89065cd2].

- **Fine-needle aspiration (FNA)**: Gold standard to confirm benign cytology; false-negative risk is ~1–3% [^d606ce46] [^06559de6].

- **Thyroid function tests**: TSH should be checked; if suppressed, assess for hyperfunctioning nodules, which are rarely malignant [^d9ba0f05] [^fb8b22b5].

---

## Management strategies for benign thyroid nodules

### Observation and surveillance

- **Watchful waiting**: Standard for most benign nodules; most remain stable or shrink [^5c0dbb5c] [^1761e04d].

- **Ultrasound surveillance**: Repeat US at 6–12 months [^b5ee6a51], then every 1–2 years if stable; adjust to risk and growth [^ba340f58].

- **Growth thresholds**: Repeat FNA if > 50% volume increase or > 20% in two dimensions with ≥ 2 mm change [^ba340f58] [^b5ee6a51].

---

### Indications for intervention

Intervention is considered when any of the following are present:

| **Indication** | **Details** |
|-|-|
| Large size | ≥ 4 cm or > 50% growth [^180d718c] [^b398452e] |
| Compressive symptoms | Dysphagia, dyspnea, hoarseness, or cosmetic concern [^e2f423d9] [^b4285298] |
| Suspicious features | New suspicious US features despite benign cytology [^b5ee6a51] [^ba340f58] |
| Patient preference | Strong preference after counseling [^d32dd489] |

---

### Surgical management

Surgery is indicated for **large, growing, or symptomatic nodules** [^180d718c] [^e2f423d9]. Lobectomy is preferred for **uninodular goiters**; total thyroidectomy is reserved for **multinodular goiters** or recurrence risk [^7db58c12]. Risks include hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, and recurrent laryngeal nerve injury [^notfound].

---

### Non-surgical minimally invasive options

- **Radiofrequency ablation (RFA)**: Effective for symptomatic or cosmetically concerning benign nodules; ~50–80% volume reduction at 6–12 months [^notfound].

- **Percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI)**: First-line for recurrent cystic nodules; ~80–90% success [^notfound].

- **Patient selection**: Firm benign diagnosis, symptomatic or cosmetic burden, and preference after counseling [^282f9edd].

---

## Medical management

Routine **levothyroxine suppression** is not recommended due to limited benefit and risks (atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis) [^8d63b40c] [^e45ecb2a]. Consider only in iodine deficiency with careful monitoring [^e45ecb2a].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular **ultrasound** is the cornerstone, with intervals tailored to risk and growth [^b5ee6a51] [^ba340f58]. Clinical review should assess for new symptoms or signs at each visit [^5938f5f4]. Repeat **FNA** is indicated for significant growth or new suspicious features [^ba340f58] [^b5ee6a51].

---

## Patient education and counseling

Explain that most benign nodules are **low risk** and require only surveillance [^3654f39b] [^97cc750a]. Discuss growth thresholds, symptoms, and when to seek care [^b5ee6a51]. Review options, risks, and benefits if intervention is considered [^59a49b1a].

---

## Special considerations

In pregnancy, **benign nodules** are managed conservatively without routine suppression or special surveillance [^baa73f59] [^a3db901f]. In pediatrics, **benign nodules** are followed with ultrasound; surgery is reserved for large, growing, or symptomatic lesions [^3bf73e3d].

---

Benign thyroid nodules are **managed conservatively** with ultrasound surveillance and selective intervention for large, growing, or symptomatic nodules. Suppressive therapy is not routine, and minimally invasive options offer effective alternatives to surgery when appropriate [^97cc750a] [^59a49b1a].

Background

Thyroid nodules are a common clinical problem, and differentiated thyroid cancer is becoming increasingly prevalent. Since the American Thyroid Association's (ATA's) guidelines for the management of these disorders were revised in 2009, significant scientific advances have occurred in the field. The aim of these guidelines is to inform clinicians, patients, researchers, and health policy makers on published evidence relating to the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer.

Methods

The specific clinical questions addressed in these guidelines were based on prior versions of the guidelines, stakeholder input, and input of task force members. Task force panel members were educated on knowledge synthesis methods, including electronic database searching, review and selection of relevant citations, and critical appraisal of selected studies. Published English language articles on adults were eligible for inclusion. The American College of Physicians Guideline Grading System was used for critical appraisal of evidence and grading strength of recommendations for therapeutic interventions. We developed a similarly formatted system to appraise the quality of such studies and resultant recommendations. The guideline panel had complete editorial independence from the ATA. Competing interests of guideline task force members were regularly updated, managed, and communicated to the ATA and task force members.

Results

The revised guidelines for the management of thyroid nodules include recommendations regarding initial evaluation, clinical and ultrasound criteria for fine-needle aspiration biopsy, interpretation of fine-needle aspiration biopsy results, use of molecular markers, and management of benign thyroid nodules. Recommendations regarding the initial management of thyroid cancer include those relating to screening for thyroid cancer, staging and risk assessment, surgical management, radioiodine remnant ablation and therapy, and thyrotropin suppression therapy using levothyroxine. Recommendations related to long-term management of differentiated thyroid cancer include those related to surveillance for recurrent disease using imaging and serum thyroglobulin, thyroid hormone therapy, management of recurrent and metastatic disease, consideration for clinical trials and targeted therapy, as well as directions for future research.

Conclusions

We have developed evidence-based recommendations to inform clinical decision-making in the management of thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer. They represent, in our opinion, contemporary optimal care for patients with these disorders.

### Management of thyroid nodules [^97cc750a]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

In the past 30 years, there has been a substantial rise in the detection of thyroid nodules. Largely asymptomatic, thyroid nodules are most often incidental findings that typically pose minimal risk. Data supporting these findings show a rapid rise in the incidental detection of thyroid nodules and cancer, but minimal effect on mortality rates, despite treatment. These data imply that historical approaches to thyroid nodule and cancer care might at times include unnecessary or excessive care. To address this issue, the past decade has witnessed an increasingly conservative approach to nodule management, seeking to individualise care and provide the most focused intervention that leads to favourable outcomes. Benign nodules can be safely monitored with minimal, or long-interval follow-up imaging. Molecular testing should be considered for cytologically indeterminate nodules because of its ability to improve preoperative cancer risk determination and reduce unnecessary surgery. The treatment of biopsy-proven malignant nodules has become increasingly nuanced, since recommendations for near-total thyroidectomy are no longer routine. Hemithyroidectomy is now commonly considered when operative intervention is favoured. Some patients with small volume, isolated cancerous nodules are safely managed non-operatively with active monitoring. In summary, modern management strategies for thyroid nodular disease seek to incorporate the growing amount of available diagnostic and prognostic data, inclusive of demographic, radiological, pathological and molecular findings. Once obtained, an individualised management plan can be effectively formulated.

Benign solid thyroid nodules — surgery versus surveillance: Surgery may be considered for growing nodules that are benign after repeat fine-needle aspiration (FNA) if they are large (> 4 cm), causing compressive or structural symptoms, or based upon clinical concern (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). Patients with growing nodules that are benign after FNA should be regularly monitored, and most asymptomatic nodules demonstrating modest growth should be followed without intervention (Strong recommendation, Low-quality evidence).

### Revised American Thyroid Association management guidelines for patients with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer [^e0ffd213]. Thyroid (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Thyroid nodules are a common clinical problem, and differentiated thyroid cancer is becoming increasingly prevalent. Since the publication of the American Thyroid Association's guidelines for the management of these disorders was published in 2006, a large amount of new information has become available, prompting a revision of the guidelines.

Methods

Relevant articles through December 2008 were reviewed by the task force and categorized by topic and level of evidence according to a modified schema used by the United States Preventative Services Task Force.

Results

The revised guidelines for the management of thyroid nodules include recommendations regarding initial evaluation, clinical and ultrasound criteria for fine-needle aspiration biopsy, interpretation of fine-needle aspiration biopsy results, and management of benign thyroid nodules. Recommendations regarding the initial management of thyroid cancer include those relating to optimal surgical management, radioiodine remnant ablation, and suppression therapy using levothyroxine. Recommendations related to long-term management of differentiated thyroid cancer include those related to surveillance for recurrent disease using ultrasound and serum thyroglobulin as well as those related to management of recurrent and metastatic disease.

Conclusions

We created evidence-based recommendations in response to our appointment as an independent task force by the American Thyroid Association to assist in the clinical management of patients with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer. They represent, in our opinion, contemporary optimal care for patients with these disorders.

### Management of thyroid incidentalomas [^c04dd607]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The discovery of a thyroid incidentaloma warrants a systematic approach for those nodules most likely to be cancerous. An optimal management strategy for thyroid incidentalomas should be guided by four questions: (1) Does the incidentally detected thyroid nodule put the patient at risk for an adverse outcome; (2) Can those individuals with malignant thyroid nodules be identified; (3) Is the treatment of thyroid malignancy more effective in presymptomatic patients; and (4) Do the beneficial effects of presymptomatic detection and treatment in these patients justify the costs incurred Physicians caring for patients with thyroid disease should participate in data acquisition in national databases and properly randomized studies, to address the optimal management strategy in the treatment of incidentally-detected thyroid nodules.

### The diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules: a review [^3654f39b]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Thyroid nodules are common, being detected in up to 65% of the general population. This is likely due to the increased use of diagnostic imaging for purposes unrelated to the thyroid. Most thyroid nodules are benign, clinically insignificant, and safely managed with a surveillance program. The main goal of initial and long-term follow-up is identification of the small subgroup of nodules that harbor a clinically significant cancer (≈10%), cause compressive symptoms (≈5%), or progress to functional disease (≈5%).

Observations

Thyroid function testing and ultrasonographic characteristics guide the initial management of thyroid nodules. Certain ultrasound features, such as a cystic or spongiform appearance, suggest a benign process that does not require additional testing. Suspicious sonographic patterns including solid composition, hypoechogenicity, irregular margins, and microcalcifications should prompt cytological evaluation. Additional diagnostic procedures, such as molecular testing, are indicated only in selected cases, such as indeterminate cytology (≈20%-30% of all biopsies). The initial risk estimate, derived from ultrasound and, if performed, cytology report, should determine the need for treatment and the type, frequency, and length of subsequent follow-up. Management includes simple observation, local treatments, and surgery and should be based on the estimated risk of malignancy and the presence and severity of compressive symptoms.

Conclusions and Relevance

Most thyroid nodules are benign. A diagnostic approach that uses ultrasound and, when indicated, fine-needle aspiration biopsy and molecular testing, facilitates a personalized, risk-based protocol that promotes high-quality care and minimizes cost and unnecessary testing.

### Contemporary thyroid nodule evaluation and management [^d32dd489]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The evaluation and management of patients with thyroid nodules is no longer a 1-size-fits-all proposition. The tailored approach advocated today requires a careful assessment of each nodule to determine the likelihood that it is malignant and the chances that it will cause symptoms. Very few nodules will require an intensive workup that includes cytology and molecular testing of FNAB samples: for the vast majority, a systematic cervical US examination with assessment of clinical risk factors will provide a reliable foundation for identifying the initial management strategy. After an appropriate initial assessment, the frequency of subsequent surveillance visits for most nodules can be safely reduced compared with currently used schedules. This is particularly relevant for frail, elderly individuals, as they are unlikely to be harmed by the thyroid tumor itself, and overmedicalization can cause more harm than good. In these populations, surveillance can safely be confined to a periodic clinical examination. If surgery is needed, resections can often be less extensive. In some cases, minimally invasive, percutaneous approaches are a viable alternative to surgery. When there are multiple options, they should be discussed as frankly as possible with the patient, outlining the advantages, limitations, benefits, and risks of each. The goal is to identify the best strategy for the individual patient, in terms of disease outcomes and quality of life, avoiding the pitfalls of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. For health professionals, this means learning to work with some degree of clinical uncertainty rather than automatically resorting to intensive testing and intervention, and by weighing patients' expectations and demands.

Benign cytology follow-up — risk stratification and long-term outcomes: the follow-up of thyroid nodules with benign cytology diagnoses should be determined by risk stratification based upon ultrasound (US) pattern as defined in Recommendation 8. If follow-up US for surveillance is performed and the nodule size is stable, the utility of subsequent US imaging for detection of potential malignancy by nodule growth assessment is very low and if performed, the time interval for any additional US exam should be at least as long that between the initial benign FNA cytology result and first follow-up. A total of 1369 patients with 2010 cytologically benign thyroid nodules were followed for a mean of 8.5 years, and eighteen false-negative cancers were identified; thirty deaths were documented and none were attributable to thyroid cancer. These data support that an initial benign cytologic diagnosis conveys an overall excellent prognosis, and a conservative follow-up strategy is reasonable.

Benign thyroid nodules — medical therapy and iodine intake: Routine TSH suppression therapy for benign thyroid nodules in iodine sufficient populations is not recommended, with the guideline noting that the potential harm outweighs benefit for most patients (Strong recommendation, High-quality evidence). Individual patients with benign, solid, or mostly solid nodules should have adequate iodine intake, and a daily supplement (containing 150 μg iodine) is recommended (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence), while one randomized trial found that sufficient dietary iodine intake (150 μg daily) also reduced nodule size slightly more than placebo. When used, suppressive levothyroxine (LT4) has modest efficacy, with an average 5%–15% reduction in nodule volume when treated for 6–18 months, and two high-quality meta-analyses indicate that six to eight patients will require suppressive LT4 to achieve one successful treatment response. The TSH suppression in high-quality studies often reached substantial levels — the majority suppressed TSH to < 0.2 mIU/L, with many to < 0.1 mIU/L — which has been associated with an increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and osteoporosis.

### Contemporary thyroid nodule evaluation and management [^55842d41]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Context

Approximately 60% of adults harbor 1 or more thyroid nodules. The possibility of cancer is the overriding concern, but only about 5% prove to be malignant. The widespread use of diagnostic imaging and improved access to health care favor the discovery of small, subclinical nodules and small papillary cancers. Overdiagnosis and overtreatment is associated with potentially excessive costs and nonnegligible morbidity for patients.

Evidence Acquisition

We conducted a PubMed search for the recent English-language articles dealing with thyroid nodule management.

Evidence Synthesis

The initial assessment includes an evaluation of clinical risk factors and sonographic examination of the neck. Sonographic risk-stratification systems (e.g. Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data Systems) can be used to estimate the risk of malignancy and the need for biopsy based on nodule features and size. When cytology findings are indeterminate, molecular analysis of the aspirate may obviate the need for diagnostic surgery. Many nodules will not require biopsy. These nodules and those that are cytologically benign can be managed with long-term follow-up alone. If malignancy is suspected, options include surgery (increasingly less extensive), active surveillance or, in selected cases, minimally invasive techniques.

Conclusion

Thyroid nodule evaluation is no longer a 1-size-fits-all proposition. For most nodules, the likelihood of malignancy can be confidently estimated without resorting to cytology or molecular testing, and low-frequency surveillance is sufficient for most patients. When there are multiple options for diagnosis and/or treatment, they should be discussed with patients as frankly as possible to identify an approach that best meets their needs.

### Management of thyroid nodules: a clinicopathological, evidence-based approach [^f2774db5]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2004). Low credibility.

Management of thyroid nodules is one of the most controversial issues in thyroidology. Different approaches derive from geographical variation in presentation, inadequate or incomplete clinical diagnosis, lack of prospective controlled studies and, frequently, the different cultural backgrounds of physicians. This review aims to offer a practical approach to the management of nodular thyroid disorders, considering the way in which the pathophysiology of the disease provides clues to the correct clinical diagnosis and therapy.

### Thyroid nodules: past, present, and future [^120e677d]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Over the past millennia, the evaluation and management of thyroid nodules has essentially remained the same with thyroidectomy as the only reliable method to identify malignancy. However, in the last 30 years, technological advances have significantly improved diagnostic management of thyroid nodules. Advances in imaging have allowed development of a reliable risk- based stratification system to identify nodules at increased risk of malignancy. At the same time, sensitive imaging has caused collateral damage to the degree that we are now identifying and treating many small, low risk nodules with little to no clinical relevance.

Objective

To review the history of thyroid nodule evaluation with emphasis on recent changes and future pathways.

Methods

Literature review and discussion.

Results

Thyroid ultrasound remains the best initial method to evaluate the thyroid gland for nodules. Different risk-of-malignancy protocols have been developed and introduced by different societies, reporting methods have been developed and improved each, with goals of improving the ability to recognize nodules requiring further intervention and minimizing excessive monitoring of those who do not. Once identified, cytological evaluation of nodules further enhances malignancy identification with molecular markers assisting in ruling out malignancies in indeterminate nodules preventing unneeded intervention. And all societies have urged avoidance of overdiagnosis and overtreatment of low-risk cancers of little to no clinical relevance.

Conclusion

In this review, we describe advancements in nodule evaluation and management, while emphasizing caution in overdiagnosing and overtreating low-risk lesions without clinical importance.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and associazione medici endocrinologi medical guidelines for clinical practice for the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules [^e3d7ba7b]. Endocrine Practice (2006). Low credibility.

Thyroid nodules are common and are frequently benign. Current data suggest that the prevalence of palpable thyroid nodules is 3% to 7% in North America; the prevalence is as high as 50% based on ultrasonography (US) or autopsy data. The introduction of sensitive thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone or TSH) assays, the widespread application of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy, and the availability of high-resolution US have substantially improved the management of thyroid nodules. This document was prepared as a collaborative effort between the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) and the Associazione Medici Endocrinologi (AME). Most Task Force members are members of AACE. We have used the AACE protocol for clinical practice guidelines, with rating of available evidence, linking the guidelines to the strength of recommendations. Key observations include the following. Although most patients with thyroid nodules are asymptomatic, occasionally patients complain of dysphagia, dysphonia, pressure, pain, or symptoms of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Absence of symptoms does not rule out a malignant lesion; thus, it is important to review risk factors for malignant disease. Thyroid US should not be performed as a screening test. All patients with a palpable thyroid nodule, however, should undergo US examination. US-guided FNA (US-FNA) is recommended for nodules ≥ 10 mm; US-FNA is suggested for nodules < 10 mm only if clinical information or US features are suspicious. Thyroid FNA is reliable and safe, and smears should be interpreted by an experienced pathologist. Patients with benign thyroid nodules should undergo follow-up, and malignant or suspicious nodules should be treated surgically. A radioisotope scan of the thyroid is useful if the TSH level is low or suppressed. Measurement of serum TSH is the best initial laboratory test of thyroid function and should be followed by measurement of free thyroxine if the TSH value is low and of thyroid peroxidase antibody if the TSH value is high. Percutaneous ethanol injection is useful in the treatment of cystic thyroid lesions; large, symptomatic goiters may be treated surgically or with radioiodine. Routine measurement of serum calcitonin is not recommended. Suggestions for thyroid nodule management during pregnancy are presented. We believe that these guidelines will be useful to clinical endocrinologists, endocrine surgeons, pediatricians, and internists whose practices include management of patients with thyroid disorders. These guidelines are thorough and practical, and they offer reasoned and balanced recommendations based on the best available evidence.

### Thyroid disorders: evaluation and management of thyroid nodules [^0ddd484a]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Although thyroid nodules are a common clinical entity, few (5% to 10%) are malignant and require surgical treatment. Most nodules are discovered incidentally in patients undergoing surveillance for medical reasons unrelated to thyroid disorders. Therefore, a systematic approach to their evaluation is important to avoid unnecessary surgery. High-resolution ultrasonography and fine-needle aspiration have resulted in substantial improvements in diagnostic accuracy, cost reductions, and higher malignancy yield at the time of surgery. In this article, the authors present practical guidelines and a suggested management strategy for the effective diagnosis and management of incidentally discovered thyroid nodules.

Follow-up examinations: what to look for

Fig. 1 shows the simulated management strategies and outcomes of 1000 newly discovered thyroid nodules. The overall management pathway is based on the US-risk stratification of the target lesions and the cytology assessment (if any). These scenarios do not include symptomatic thyroid nodules that are already candidates for resection regardless of their sonographic features. In these cases, a biopsy might be performed to clarify the best surgical approach, but the results would not change the indication for surgery itself. The distributions of US-defined risk classes, US-defined FNAB indications, and Bethesda cytology class were derived from published findings. For illustration purposes, all indeterminate nodules are shown as undergoing molecular testing, although other options are offered. However, if these alternative approaches, guided by clinical and US data, had been used, it is unlikely that the final number of resected nodules and their malignancy rate would be significantly different from those shown in Fig. 1. The hypothetical molecular testing approach depicted has a benign call rate of 65%, a positive predictive value of 50%, and a negative predictive value of 96%.

Thyroid nodules are common and often asymptomatic. However, patients may seek treatment for nonfunctional benign nodules that cause compressive symptoms or cosmetic problems. Additionally, many patients with autonomously functioning nodules also seek treatment. As minimally invasive thermal ablation techniques become more wide spread, providers offering these treatments should be familiar with the pathophysiology of thyroid nodules, and with how to work up a patient with nodular thyroid disease.

### Understanding the risks and harms of management of incidental thyroid nodules: a review [^336b17a8]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Incidental thyroid nodules are defined as nodules originally detected in a patient with no thyroid-related clinical symptoms, examination findings, or suspected thyroid disease. Medical imaging for diseases in the neck, chest, and spine is a common source of incidental thyroid nodules. They are easily detected but poorly characterized. The next step is to decide whether the incidental thyroid nodule should be further evaluated with ultrasonography.

Observations

Indiscriminate workup of incidental thyroid nodules with ultrasonography is not cost-effective and is potentially harmful. Although the concern for malignant neoplasms drives workup, the risk for poor outcomes without evaluation is minimal. The rate of malignant tumors in patients with 1 or more thyroid nodules larger than 5 mm is only 1.6%, and most small thyroid cancers are indolent. Substantial evidence suggests that a reservoir of thyroid cancers does not progress, and workup after detection with imaging leads to epidemiologic overdiagnosis. Finally, a significant proportion of patients with benign nodules have cytologic results that are not definitive and require lobectomy. Evidence-based recommendations for incidental thyroid nodules detected at computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, nuclear medicine studies, and extrathyroidal ultrasonography include selection criteria for nodule workup based on suspicious imaging findings, patient age, and nodule size. In the absence of clinical risk factors or suspicious imaging findings, workup with dedicated thyroid ultrasonography is only recommended for nodules at least 1.5 cm in patients 35 years or older and for nodules at least 1.0 cm in patients younger than 35 years.

Conclusions and Relevance

Only a few select incidental thyroid nodules require further evaluation with ultrasonography based on recommendations that aim to diagnose clinically significant thyroid cancers while reducing unnecessary workup and provide guidance for clinical practice.

Background: The primary goal of this interdisciplinary consensus statement is to provide a framework for the safe adoption and implementation of ablation technologies for benign thyroid nodules. Summary: This consensus statement is organized around three key themes: (1) safety of ablation techniques and their implementation, (2) optimal skillset criteria for proceduralists performing ablative procedures, and (3) defining expectations of success for this treatment option given its unique risks and benefits. Ablation safety considerations in pre-procedural, peri-procedural, and post-procedural settings are discussed, including clinical factors related to patient selection and counseling, anesthetic and technical considerations to optimize patient safety, peri-procedural risk mitigation strategies, post-procedural complication management, and safe follow-up practices. Prior training, knowledge, and steps that should be considered by any physician who desires to incorporate thyroid nodule ablation into their practice are defined and discussed. Examples of successful clinical practice implementation models of this emerging technology are provided. Conclusions: Thyroid ablative procedures provide valid alternative treatment strategies to conventional surgical management for a subset of patients with symptomatic benign thyroid nodules. Careful patient and nodule selection are critical to the success of these procedures as is extensive pre-procedural patient counseling. Although these emerging technologies hold great promise, they are not without risk and require the development of a unique skillset and environment for optimal, safe performance and consistent outcomes.

### Thyroid nodules: diagnosis and management [^b4c687a3]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Thyroid nodules, with a prevalence of almost 25% in the general population, are a common occurrence. Their prevalence varies considerably depending on demographics such as age and sex as well as the presence of risk factors. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the prevalence, risk stratification and current management strategies for thyroid nodules, with a particular focus on changes in diagnostic and therapeutic protocols that have occurred over the past 10 years. Several sonography-based stratification systems (such as Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data Systems (TIRADS)) might help to predict the malignancy risk of nodules, potentially eliminating the need for biopsy in many instances. However, large or suspicious nodules necessitate cytological evaluation following fine-needle aspiration biopsy for accurate classification. In the case of cytology yielding indeterminate results, additional tools, such as molecular testing, can assist in guiding the management plan. Surgery is no longer the only treatment for symptomatic or malignant nodules: active surveillance or local ablative treatments might be beneficial for appropriately selected patients. To enhance clinician-patient interactions and discussions about diagnostic options, shared decision-making tools have been developed. A personalized, risk-based protocol promotes high-quality care while minimizing costs and unnecessary testing.

### Evaluation… [^fb8b22b5]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Thyroid nodules are common in the general population, especially in women. 1 Nonpalpable nodules are often found when patients undergo diagnostic imaging such as ultrasonography and computed tomography of the chest and neck. For these incidentalomas, current guidelines recommend the same diagnostic strategy that is recommended for palpable nodules. 2 Although the risk of malignancy in any given nodule is small, thyroid cancer must be considered in the differential diagnosis. Family physicians should understand the rationale for the evaluation of nodules and be able to perform an evidence-based assessment. Thyroid cancer represents 1% of all malignancies. 10 The rate of malignancy is 1. 5% to 17% in nodules detected on imaging performed for non–thyroid-related reasons.

4 However, the true rate of malignancy is unknown, because many nodules are small enough to escape detection, and because many malignancies in small nodules appear to have a benign course and do not cause clinically evident disease. Evaluation The primary goal when evaluating a thyroid nodule is to determine whether it is malignant. Figure 1 presents a suggested algorithm for evaluating and treating thyroid nodules. 14 Because of genetic mutations, a small number of nodules escape regulation by the normal thyroid-stimulating hormone feedback system and autonomously produce thyroid hormone. 15 Although reliable figures are not available, the proportion is probably about 5%. 15 These so-called "hot" nodules are unlikely to be malignant and require treatment that is somewhat different than that for other nodules. A reasonable first step in evaluating a thyroid nodule is to check TSH levels and perform thyroid ultrasonography.

1, 14 If TSH is suppressed, radionuclide scintigraphy with technetium 99m or iodine 123 can determine whether there are hyperfunctioning nodules or whether the entire thyroid gland is overactive, as it would be in cases of toxic multinodular goiter. 1, 14. In the past, nuclear thyroid scintigraphy was often performed to evaluate all thyroid nodules. However, nonfunctioning nodules have only a 14% to 22% chance of being malignant. FNA is less reliable in preadolescents, and excision of nodules rather than FNA is recommended. 20 In children and adolescents with a family history of thyroid cancer or MEN type 2, aggressive early prophylactic thyroidectomy is recommended for treatment of thyroid nodules. 20.

### Management guidelines for children with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer [^d2e4dc7f]. Thyroid (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Previous guidelines for the management of thyroid nodules and cancers were geared toward adults. Compared with thyroid neoplasms in adults, however, those in the pediatric population exhibit differences in pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and long-term outcomes. Furthermore, therapy that may be recommended for an adult may not be appropriate for a child who is at low risk for death but at higher risk for long-term harm from overly aggressive treatment. For these reasons, unique guidelines for children and adolescents with thyroid tumors are needed.

Methods

A task force commissioned by the American Thyroid Association (ATA) developed a series of clinically relevant questions pertaining to the management of children with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). Using an extensive literature search, primarily focused on studies that included subjects ≤ 18 years of age, the task force identified and reviewed relevant articles through April 2014. Recommendations were made based upon scientific evidence and expert opinion and were graded using a modified schema from the United States Preventive Services Task Force.

Results

These inaugural guidelines provide recommendations for the evaluation and management of thyroid nodules in children and adolescents, including the role and interpretation of ultrasound, fine-needle aspiration cytology, and the management of benign nodules. Recommendations for the evaluation, treatment, and follow-up of children and adolescents with DTC are outlined and include preoperative staging, surgical management, postoperative staging, the role of radioactive iodine therapy, and goals for thyrotropin suppression. Management algorithms are proposed and separate recommendations for papillary and follicular thyroid cancers are provided.

Conclusions

In response to our charge as an independent task force appointed by the ATA, we developed recommendations based on scientific evidence and expert opinion for the management of thyroid nodules and DTC in children and adolescents. In our opinion, these represent the current optimal care for children and adolescents with these conditions.

### Evidence and thoughts about thyroid nodules that grow after they have been identified as benign by aspiration cytology [^e1bcd950]. Thyroid (2003). Low credibility.

Coherent management of thyroid nodules that grow after being identified as benign will vary depending on their biology. Some are thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) regulated, so a dose of levothyroxine that reduces TSH to the lower limits of normal (subsuppression) may prevent or reverse enlargement; others are controlled by poorly understood mechanisms that must be elucidated before effective medical treatment can be designed; a few are autonomous requiring obliteration, and a very few are "missed" malignancies that should be excised.

### Contemporary thyroid nodule evaluation and management [^9bc8d598]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of thyroid nodules in the general population is high — up to 60% as documented by high-resolution ultrasonography — but very few of these lesions ultimately prove to be malignant (about 5%). Although epidemiological studies suggest a small but real increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer, likely stemming from exposure to environmental risk factors, the growing number of thyroid cancer diagnoses is largely attributable to the increasingly widespread use of diagnostic imaging technology and medical surveillance, together with improved access to health care in general, all of which favor the discovery of small, subclinical thyroid nodules and small papillary thyroid cancers. These considerations have raised concern over the costs and potential morbidity associated with the short- and long-term management of patients with thyroid nodules, which includes periodic outpatient visits and cervical ultrasound examinations, fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB), genomic testing, and, in some indeterminate cases, diagnostic thyroid lobectomy. On the whole, there is a clearly perceived need for a more refined, tailored, and careful approach to the management of these highly prevalent lesions. Similar considerations can be extended to that amount of nodules that are proven to be malignant, but have a low-risk phenotype, and can be safely managed through more conservative surgery or even active surveillance programs. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of currently recommended practices for the initial workup and subsequent management of patients with thyroid nodules.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American college of endocrinology, and associazione medici endocrinologi medical guidelines for clinical practice for the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules – 2016 update [^fb4099e4]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Medium credibility.

Thyroid nodule management (AACE/ACE/AME 2016) — abstract highlights prevalence, risk stratification, biopsy thresholds, and treatment. Thyroid nodules are detected in up to 50 to 60% of healthy subjects, and ultrasonography (US) and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy serve as diagnostic cornerstones. On the basis of US features, nodules may be categorized into 3 groups: low-, intermediate- and high-malignancy risk, and FNA should be considered for nodules ≤ 10 mm in diameter only when suspicious US signs are present, while nodules ≤ 5 mm should not be biopsied. Cytology reporting is recommended to use 5 categories (nondiagnostic, benign, indeterminate, suspicious for malignancy, or malignant), with indeterminate lesions further subdivided into 2 subclasses. The abstract notes that at present, no single cytochemical or genetic marker can definitely rule out malignancy in indeterminate nodules. Most thyroid nodules do not require any treatment, levothyroxine (LT4)-suppressive therapy is not recommended, and percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) should be the first-line treatment option for relapsing, benign cystic lesions, whereas US-guided thermal ablation treatments may be considered for solid or mixed symptomatic benign thyroid nodules; surgery remains the treatment of choice for malignant or suspicious nodules.

Benign thyroid nodules — surgical indications — when related to a thyroid nodule, the following symptoms are listed as possible operative triggers: "the following symptoms are possible indications for surgical treatment: neck pressure, dysphagia, globus sensation, shortness of breath (especially when in the supine position), dyspnea on exertion, and pain", and "the appearance of sudden and persistent dysphonia should prompt a rapid surgical consultation". If a nodule shows progression, "a suspicious change in US features or increases in volume and becomes symptomatic, surgical resection should be considered despite benign FNA results", and "for benign nodules ≥ 4 cm, surgery could be considered given the higher incidence of neoplastic disease present in large and progressively growing nodules". Management options include that "a symptomatic uninodular goiter or an MNG, whether cytologically benign or hyperthyroid, may be treated surgically or with radioiodine", while "in elderly or fragile patients and those who decline surgery, nonsurgical, US-guided, minimally invasive techniques represent effective alternative therapeutic options".

If nodules are unchanged at the first US control, repeat US after 24 months. In nodules with benign cytology but suspicious clinical or US features, a repeat FNA is recommended. Repeat FNA is recommended in nodules with a > 50% increase in volume or in those that become symptomatic.

American Thyroid Association — initial follow-up of nodules with benign FNA cytology: Given the low false-negative rate of US-guided FNA and the higher yield of missed malignancies by US pattern, follow-up should be determined by US risk stratification. Nodules with high suspicion US pattern: repeat US and US-guided FNA within 12 months (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). Nodules with low to intermediate suspicion US pattern: repeat US at 12–24 months; if growth is seen — defined as a 20% increase in at least two nodule dimensions with a minimal increase of 2 mm or more than a 50% change in volume — or if new suspicious features develop, FNA could be repeated or observation continued with repeat US, with repeat FNA if growth continues (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). Nodules with very low suspicion US pattern (including spongiform): surveillance utility is limited; if US is repeated, it should be done at ≥ 24 months (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence).

Primum non nocere

Clinicians encountering patients with thyroid nodules today are faced with the task of avoiding the overdiagnosis of low-risk cancers without jeopardizing the chances of identifying those rare advanced or higher risk tumors that will require prompt treatment. Overdiagnosis implies the discovery of conditions that will never cause morbidity or death. As such, their identification can trigger a cascade of deleterious events: people are transformed into patients, with inevitable emotional consequences and potential exposure to risks related to overmedicalization and overtreatment. At the public health level, overdiagnosis overstretches the capacities of health systems, increases spending, and subtracts resources from patients with the greatest health care needs. It is little wonder that the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force now recommends against thyroid cancer screening in asymptomatic adults, because its harmful effects outweigh its potential benefits. The recommendation against screening does not apply to patients with known risk factors for thyroid cancer (e.g. childhood radiation exposure in the form of radioactive fallout or radiotherapy, including low-dose forms for benign conditions; inherited syndromes associated with thyroid cancer; a family history of thyroid cancer), but even in these cases, the benefits of early detection have yet to be demonstrated. So, the implementation of sonographic screening programs for thyroid nodules is discouraged.

Thyroid nodules are detected in up to 50 to 60% of healthy subjects. Most nodules do not cause clinically significant symptoms, and as a result, the main challenge in their management is to rule out malignancy, with ultrasonography (US) and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy serving as diagnostic cornerstones. The key issues discussed in these guidelines are as follows: (1) US-based categorization of the malignancy risk and indications for US-guided FNA (henceforth, FNA), (2) cytologic classification of FNA samples, (3) the roles of immunocytochemistry and molecular testing applied to thyroid FNA, (4) therapeutic options, and (5) follow-up strategy. Thyroid nodule management during pregnancy and in children are also addressed. On the basis of US features, thyroid nodules may be categorized into 3 groups: low-, intermediate-and high-malignancy risk. FNA should be considered for nodules ≤ 10 mm diameter only when suspicious US signs are present, while nodules ≤ 5 mm should be monitored rather than biopsied. A classification scheme of 5 categories (nondiagnostic, benign, indeterminate, suspicious for malignancy, or malignant) is recommended for the cytologic report. Indeterminate lesions are further subdivided into 2 subclasses to more accurately stratify the risk of malignancy. At present, no single cytochemical or genetic marker can definitely rule out malignancy in indeterminate nodules. Nevertheless, these tools should be considered together with clinical data, US signs, elastographic pattern, or results of other imaging techniques to improve the management of these lesions. Most thyroid nodules do not require any treatment, and levothyroxine (LT4) suppressive therapy is not recommended. Percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) should be the first-line treatment option for relapsing, benign cystic lesions, while US-guided thermal ablation treatments may be considered for solid or mixed symptomatic benign thyroid nodules. Surgery remains the treatment of choice for malignant or suspicious nodules. The present document updates previous guidelines released in 2006 and 2010 by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE), American College of Endocrinology (ACE) and Associazione Medici Endocrinologi (AME).

### Long-versus short-interval follow-up of cytologically benign thyroid nodules: a prospective cohort study [^6d94a99f]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Thyroid nodules are increasingly common, affecting 5–20% of the adult population. Once detected, ultrasound (US) is recommended, often in conjunction with fine needle aspiration (FNA). A benign cytological result is obtained in 65–75% of cases, most often leading to a recommendation for conservative (i.e. non-surgical) management. However, cytological examination is not flawless and many studies confirm a modest, though non-negligible 1–10% risk of a false-negative cytology (i.e. malignancy). Because of this, physicians have long recommended continued follow-up of cytologically benign nodules.

However, the empirical evidence for this recommendation remains weak, as there are little data on the optimal time interval for such a repeat evaluation, while other investigations have suggested a negligible risk of disease-specific mortality regardless of follow-up strategy. Current guidelines recommend repeat evaluation after 1–2 years; however, this is based solely on expert opinion. Furthermore, it is unclear what specific findings at the time of repeat evaluation should prompt concern or further investigation, which has led to confusion and variability in clinical practice.

The importance of establishing improved guidance should not be underestimated. Thyroid nodules afflict millions of patients worldwide, and most prove benign. Despite this, follow-up and repeat assessment are extended over many years, with some undergoing lifelong follow-up. Nodule growth can be expected over time, though most often it does not signal malignant concern. While US is superior to physical examination of the neck, such technology also exacerbates concern regarding small changes in nodule size or parenchyma. In an era of increasing healthcare cost and intervention, some have argued that overtreatment and overdiagnosis of nodular thyroid disease is occurring. It is estimated that over 500,000 thyroid nodule aspirates occur annually in the United States alone (Medicare data); as 300,000–350,000 will prove benign, millions of repeat assessments are mandated during the years thereafter. Determining the optimal time interval for such evaluations would reduce unnecessary anxieties, while likely leading to fewer US examinations, repeat aspirations, and thyroidectomies. Ultimately, patient morbidity may be decreased while healthcare savings are realized.

### Management guidelines for children with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer [^27adb6d6]. Thyroid (2015). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association pediatric thyroid cancer guidelines — scope and methods emphasize that a task force commissioned by the American Thyroid Association developed clinically relevant questions for managing children with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), used an extensive literature search focused on studies with subjects ≤ 18 years of age with articles identified through April 2014, and graded recommendations using a modified schema from the United States Preventive Services Task Force. These inaugural guidelines provide recommendations for the evaluation and management of thyroid nodules in children and adolescents, including the role and interpretation of ultrasound, fine-needle aspiration cytology, and the management of benign nodules; for DTC they outline evaluation, treatment, and follow-up including preoperative staging, surgical management, postoperative staging, the role of radioactive iodine therapy, and goals for thyrotropin suppression, and they propose management algorithms with separate recommendations for papillary and follicular thyroid cancers. The need for pediatric-specific guidance is noted because previous guidelines were geared toward adults, pediatric thyroid neoplasms differ in pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and long-term outcomes, and children may be at low risk for death but at higher risk for long-term harm from overly aggressive treatment.

### Thyroid nodules… [^acd28808]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Thyroid nodules are lumps or small growths in the thyroid gland, a hormone-secreting gland located in the neck. About 90 percent of thyroid nodules are benign. In contrast to thyroid nodules, the term goiter is. used for enlargement of the entire thyroid gland, which usually occurs because the gland is attempting to produce more thyroid hormone. The December 1, 2004, issue of JAMA includes an article about thyroid nodules and how they should be treated. Risk factors for thyroid nodules Iodine deficiency — the most common cause of. A nodule may be visible as a lump in the neck that moves with swallowing. If the nodule presses against other structures in the neck, there may be some pressure or pain. Rarely, a large nodule may cause problems with swallowing. Diagnosing thyroid nodules Thyroid nodules can sometimes be seen as lumps. in the neck or can be felt by touching the neck.

Blood tests of thyroid function should be done to see if the thyroid is making the normal amount of thyroid hormone although nodules usually do not affect thyroid hormone production. Ultrasound imaging of the thyroid using sound waves can reveal thyroid nodules and their composition. Radioactive iodine scanning can indicate whether a nodule is functioning. Almost all thyroid cancers occur in nonfunctioning nodules. Fine-needle aspiration can help determine whether the thyroid nodule is benign or malignant. A very fine needle is guided into the nodule, sometimes using ultrasound imaging,… some of the nodule cells are removed to be evaluated in the laboratory. Treatment Many benign thyroid nodules remain the same size and some shrink on their own. Synthetic thyroid hormone should be taken as a once-a-day pill only if the thyroid hormone levels are low. Administering thyroid hormone does not cause nodules to shrink.

Nodules found to be malignant should be surgically removed. For more information American Thyroid Association1-800-THYROID http: //www. thyroid. orgInformyourselfTofindthisandotherJAMAPatientPages, gotothePatientPagelinkonJAMA'sWebsiteathttp: //www. jama. com.

### In-office management of thyroid nodules [^2ee224ea]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Advancements in managing thyroid nodules are discussed, emphasizing in-office procedures as alternatives to traditional surgery. Thyroid nodules are prevalent, often benign, but some require further evaluation owing to malignancy concerns. Ultrasonography is the preferred method for evaluation, offering insights without radiation exposure. Nonsurgical interventions provide effective management options. Radiofrequency ablation reduces nodule size and symptoms with minimal complications and is performed in an outpatient setting, offering a cost-effective, quick recovery alternative to surgery. Proper training in ultrasound-guided procedures and careful patient selection are crucial for successful implementation. Minimally invasive techniques revolutionize thyroid nodule management, offering effective results with fewer complications.

### Management of the solitary thyroid nodule [^a41a91b4]. The Oncologist (2008). Low credibility.

Thyroid nodules are common, with up to 8% of the adult population having palpable nodules. With the use of ultrasound, up to 10 times more nodules are likely to be detected. Increasing numbers of nodules are being detected serendipitously because of the rising use of imaging to investigate unrelated conditions. The primary aim in investigating a thyroid nodule is to exclude the possibility of malignancy, which occurs in about 5% of nodules. This begins with a thorough history, including previous exposure to radiation and any family history of thyroid cancer or other endocrine diseases. Clinical examination of the neck should focus on the thyroid nodule and the gland itself, but also the presence of any cervical lymphadenopathy. Biochemical assessment of the thyroid needs to be followed by thyroid ultrasound, which may demonstrate features that are associated with a higher chance of the nodule being malignant. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy is crucial in the investigation of a thyroid nodule. It provides highly accurate cytologic information about the nodule from which a definitive management plan can be formulated. The challenge remains in the management of nodules that fall under the "indeterminate" category. These may be subject to more surgical intervention than is required because histological examination is the only way in which a malignancy can be excluded. Surgery followed by radioactive iodine ablation is the mainstay of treatment for differentiated thyroid cancers, and the majority of patients can expect high cure rates.

### The natural history of the benign thyroid nodule: what is the appropriate follow-up strategy? [^59fe82a3]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Long-term monitoring of benign thyroid nodules is not addressed in the present American Thyroid Association guidelines. The objective of this study was to determine the appropriate nature and length of follow-up for patients with a benign thyroid nodule.

Study Design

A retrospective review was performed of all patients referred to single endocrine surgeon for evaluation of thyroid nodules between 2006 and 2012. The review included 263 patients who had benign fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology and either underwent thyroidectomy or had at least a 1-year follow-up ultrasound. Main outcomes measures were repeat FNA and pathology results.

Results

There were 231 women and 32 men. Forty-eight patients underwent immediate thyroidectomy, with pathology showing 2 papillary thyroid cancers (PTC), and 215 patients were followed with annual ultrasounds. During follow-up, 89 (41.3%) nodules underwent repeat FNA after initial biopsy. The repeat FNA cytology showed 91% benign, 7% follicular neoplasm, and 2% PTC. During follow-up, 81 (37.6%) patients underwent thyroidectomy after 3.3 ± 2.8 years. Reasons for surgery included development of symptoms in 58 (71.6%), a non-benign repeat FNA in 8 (9.8%), or patient preference in 15 (18.5%). Surgical pathology identified 70 (86.4%) benign, 7 (8.6%) PTC, 3 (4%) follicular thyroid cancers, and 1 (1.2%) lymphoma. Median time from initial FNA to thyroidectomy in patients who had malignancy was 4.3 years. The maximum initial nodule size and average increase in nodule size did not differ between benign and malignant nodules (p = 0.54 and p = 0.75, respectively).

Conclusions

Significant numbers of benign thyroid nodules enlarge more than 5 mm over 3 years, triggering repeat FNA or thyroidectomy. Larger diameter nodules and more rapidly growing nodules were not predictive of malignancy. The practice of annually obtaining ultrasound for benign thyroid nodules should be discouraged.

Nodules benign by FNA — Follow-up — Perform clinical follow-up of FNA benign nodules, unless symptomatic. Consider a repeat clinical and US examination and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement in approximately 12 months in accordance with clinical setting. If nodules are unchanged at the first US control, repeat the US follow-up after 24 months. In asymptomatic nodules with a repeated benign cytology and no suspicious clinical or US features, routine follow-up may be avoided. In nodules with benign cytology but suspicious clinical or US features, a repeat FNA is recommended. In nodules with an increase > 50% in volume or that become symptomatic, we recommend repeat FNA.

### Long-term surveillance for benign thyroid nodules [^5938f5f4]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

The widespread use of high-resolution ultrasonography has significantly improved the detection and assessment of thyroid nodules, leading to the development of standardized sonographic nodule risk stratification systems. These systems aim to reduce unnecessary fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsies and enhance the consistency of ultrasound reporting. Most benign nodules do not require immediate intervention but instead warrant periodic surveillance, primarily through an ultrasound monitoring.

Methods

This narrative review summarizes recent literature on the long-term follow-up of benign thyroid nodules, with a focus on ultrasound surveillance strategies and the rationale behind current clinical practice guidelines.

Results

Surveillance of benign thyroid nodules typically involves periodic ultrasound examinations, combined often with clinical assessment, to detect significant growth, identify changes suggestive of false-negative classification, and exclude the appearance of compressive symptoms. While an increase in nodule size has traditionally raised concerns about potential malignancy, recent evidence suggests that benign nodules may also increase in size over time.

Conclusion

Current clinical practice guidelines recommend regular monitoring of untreated benign thyroid nodules to detect any changes in size or appearance. Follow-up intervals vary according to multiple factors (age, sonographically estimated risk, size, previous cytology), and there is a need for further research to establish optimal protocols.

### Management of incidental thyroid nodules [^c9ca8359]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Thyroid nodules are widely prevalent, and often discovered incidentally. Malignancy rates are low for incidental thyroid nodules, and overall outcomes are favorable regardless of diagnosis. Patients with thyroid nodules should be evaluated with TSH levels followed by ultrasound of the thyroid and cervical lymph nodes. It is important to recognize sonographic features suspicious for thyroid malignancy and obtain biopsies when indicated according to major society guidelines. The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology along with molecular testing can help guide management decisions regarding thyroid nodules. Surgical resection and other emerging technologies are safe and effective for the treatment of thyroid nodules needing intervention.

### Thyroid nodules: advances in evaluation and management [^d9ba0f05]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Thyroid nodules can be detected by ultrasonography in up to 68% of the general population. They are typically benign and are often discovered incidentally. The primary goal of thyroid nodule evaluation is to determine whether it is malignant. After thyroid ultrasonography has been performed, the next step is measurement of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone. If levels are low, a radionuclide thyroid uptake scan is indicated. Hyperfunctioning nodules are rarely malignant and do not require tissue sampling. Nonfunctioning nodules and nodules in a patient with a normal or high thyroid-stimulating hormone level may require fine-needle aspiration based on ultrasound characteristics and size. Nodules with suspicious features and solid hypoechoic nodules 1 cm or larger require aspiration. The Bethesda System (categories 1 through 6) is used to classify samples. Molecular testing can be used to guide treatment when aspiration yields an indeterminate result. Molecular testing detects mutations associated with thyroid cancer and can help inform decisions about surgical excision vs. continued ultrasound monitoring. Treatment of pregnant women with nonfunctioning thyroid nodules and of children with thyroid nodules is similar to that for nonpregnant adults, with the exception of molecular testing, which has not been validated in these populations.

Table 2.
Minimally Invasive Techniques for Treatment of Symptomatic, Benign Thyroid Nodules

Figure 2.
Suggested management and follow-up of nodules with no indication for immediate biopsy and those cytologically classified as benign.

On the whole, the recent findings and increasing use of comprehensive US-based risk stratification systems should reduce the "diagnostic burden" related to nodules classified as benign: they can be safely followed with visits every 2 or 3 years, and the frequency can be even further reduced if no changes have been noted at previous visits.

Patients whose nodules are cytologically classified as malignant or suspicious for malignancy (Bethesda classes V and VI; or suspicious molecular analysis) should generally be referred for surgery. However, for those with subcentimeter, intrathyroidal cancers with no high-risk features, active US surveillance can be proposed in lieu of immediate surgery. The first study published on this issue in 2003 found that more than 70% of microPTCs remained stable during surveillance, and the frequency of spread to the locoregional lymph nodes was quite low (~1%). The active surveillance strategy does not merely delay surgery: the likelihood of disease progression diminishes with age, and older patients are therefore less likely to require surgery during their lifespan. Similar results have been reported worldwide.

Active surveillance protocols initially provide for US neck examinations every 6 months. Once disease stability has been documented — in general, with 2 years of serial US examinations showing no evidence of progression — the examination frequency can be reduced to every 1 to 2 years or more. In contrast, if surveillance does reveal evidence of progression (i.e. an increase ≥ 3 mm in the maximum diameter of the nodule, growth toward the dorsal surface of the gland or toward nearby structures, or the appearance of lymph node metastases), surgery is indicated. These data provide a solid background for recommendations to avoid immediate biopsy and adopt an US-based surveillance strategy for subcentimeter, intrathyroidal nodules even if sonographically suspicious.

### Thyroid nodule growth does not indicate malignancy… [^580b5c17]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Thyroid nodules develop in nearly 50 percent of adults and become more prevalent with age. For thyroid nodules that are at least 1 cm in diameter, appropriate evaluation includes a thyroid-stimulating hormone assay and a fine-needle aspiration. The majority of FNA results are benign, and recommended follow-up consists of periodic clinical examinations or ultrasonography, with optional use of suppressive L-thyroxine therapy. If a nodule increases in size, recommendations generally include repeat FNA or surgery because of the possibility of malignancy. Alexander and associates examined the natural history of benign thyroid nodules in a retrospective study of patients who underwent initial ultrasonography and FNA and returned for follow-up ultrasonography within a five-year period. The authors reviewed the records of patients referred to the thyroid nodule clinic at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, between 1995 and 2000.

The study sample included 268 patients who had FNA-benign thyroid nodules on initial examination and underwent follow-up ultrasonography within one month to five years. The change in nodule size from initial examination to follow-up examination was assessed using three criteria: change in maximal diameter greater than 50 percent; change in maximal diameter of 3 mm or more; and change in calculated volume of 15 percent or more. Maximal diameter increased by more than 50 percent in 14 nodules and by 3 mm or greater in 86 nodules; calculated volume increased by 15 percent or more in 129 nodules. Cystic nodules were less likely to grow than were those with a greater solid component.

Nodule growth correlated significantly with the interval between initial ultrasonography and follow-up examination, but not with the patient's age, sex, baseline serum TSH concentration, orl-thyroxine use. At the time of the second ultrasonography, repeat ultrasonography was performed on 74 nodules because of nodule growth. The FNA findings were benign for all except one nodule, which was determined to be a poorly differentiated papillary carcinoma. The authors conclude that although many benign thyroid nodules grow slowly over time, this growth does not represent a false-negative initial FNA or an increased likelihood of malignant transformation.

AACE/ACE/AME thyroid nodule management — follow-up after benign FNA cytology: Thyroid nodules with benign cytologic findings and no clinical or ultrasound (US) risk factors should be followed-up clinically if they are asymptomatic, with clinical and US examination and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement appropriate in 12 to 24 months; in patients with stable US features and size, subsequent clinical controls may be performed at 2-year intervals. As a general rule, routine repeat FNA is not necessary, but cytologic assessment should be repeated for initially benign cytology with suspicious US findings because of the low (about 1%-2%) possibility of false-negative results, and reaspiration under US guidance should be performed when a nodule shows suspicious US changes, enlarges substantially, or becomes symptomatic. Observational data report a mean follow-up of 3 years with false-negative results in less than 1.5% of cases, and a minority of benign nodules — about 11% to 15% over 5 years — present progressive growth; volume increase should prompt repeat FNA only when the increase is more than 50% over 12 months.

### What is the evidence for endoscopic thyroidectomy in the management of benign thyroid disease? [^eed214f1]. World Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Discussion

The principal indication for ET remains management of benign thyroid disease. ET using a cervical access is restricted to solitary nodules < 3 cm in diameter and to thyroid lobes up to 20 mL in volume. Larger cysts if preoperatively aspirated may be removed by cervical access. Generally benign nodules < 3 cm do not require surgery, so only small nodules presenting with follicular cytology or small toxic adenomas are eligible. Therefore, 5–12% of patients who require surgical intervention for a thyroid nodule may be selected for ET by cervical approach. Small goiters and limited Graves' disease also may be a potential indication for ET, although they generally do not require surgery. Some contraindications are common to all these techniques: large goiters, invasive malignant tumors, previous cervical operations, and history of neck irradiation. Extracervical access permits larger lesions up to 60 mm in size and enlarged glands (up to 60 mL volume) to be extracted endoscopically and also low-risk carcinomas (to 10–20 mm in size; younger than aged 50 years, node-negative, intrathyroidal) have been assessed by the extracervical approach. Therefore, 34–53% may be treated by indirect ET.

Thyroid nodules are extremely common findings with a low likelihood of harboring a clinically significant malignancy. Ultrasound is highly sensitive at identifying which nodules warrant further workup with fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy. FNA should be performed based on US findings and risk categories.

Clinicians should be keenly aware of the potential for overtreatment and should make a concerted effort to factor patient values into the decision-making process.

Thyroid nodule size and growth — surveillance and risk considerations: Currently, about 50% of cytologic diagnoses of thyroid malignancy relate to papillary thyroid microcarcinomas (PTMCs) ≤ 10 mm in diameter. Even when size does not predict benign versus malignant, consideration should be given that the risk of cancer is slightly higher in nodules > 4 cm, and a large size (> 4 cm) is a risk factor for a more advanced stage in differentiated thyroid carcinoma. During follow-up, the appearance of suspicious changes at ultrasound (US) examination should prompt repeat fine-needle aspiration (FNA). Growth is not synonymous with malignancy because benign hyperplastic nodules may have a slow constant growth, whereas PTMC may be stable for years, and rapid growth is observed only in rare aggressive tumors and is usually associated with major US and clinical signs of aggressiveness. Rather than a sign of malignancy, steady nodule growth is a relevant issue when deciding an appropriate shift to active clinical management, and US monitoring is critical for assessing the response to nonsurgical therapies. Measurement of the major nodule diameter is of limited value and should not be considered a reliable index due to interobserver variability quantified in about 20%.

Patient eligibility and selection

Thermal ablation

TA for benign nodules is most appropriate for patients with compressive and/or cosmetic complaints that can be clearly attributed to a single or dominant nodule. Patients with autonomously functioning thyroid nodules (AFTNs) causing subclinical or overt hyperthyroidism can also be successfully treated with ablative techniques. Because ablation does not allow for definitive histologic analysis of the nodule, a firm conviction of benignity must be present to minimize the risk of overlooking malignant lesions.

Thyroid nodules categorized at US examination as very low/low suspicion of malignancy according to the ATA classification system (American College of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data Systems [ACR TIRADS] classes 1, 2, or 3) and nodules classified as intermediate suspicion according to the ATA (ACR TIRADS class 4) with benign cytology can be considered candidates for ablation, provided cytology is benign. Two benign biopsies are usually recommended. A single benign biopsy may be sufficient for:
nodules with very low sonographic suspicion
autonomously functioning nodules with low to intermediate sonographic suspicion.

Careful patient selection and establishment of expectations are imperative to safe and effective thyroid nodule ablations (Fig. 1). Prior guidelines have suggested nodules be at least 2–3 cm in size to consider ablation, though thresholds contributing to compressive or cosmetic concern will differ by location within the thyroid.

FIG. 1.
Initial management algorithm for non-functioning benign thyroid nodules.

Small solitary benign nodules < 1.5 cm in size are rarely symptomatic and generally do not require any treatment. Though an absolute maximum size has not been established, larger nodules exceeding 20–30 mL [Nodule Volume = (Π/6) diameter 1 × diameter 2 × diameter 3] achieve less volume reduction, and may require multiple ablative sessions to achieve the goals of treatment. As such, shared decision making with discussion of alternative treatment options such as surgery is essential to ensure expectations align with reasonably achievable outcomes for patients with large volume nodules.

### Presentation… [^ee903c0d]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

A thyroid nodule is a palpable swelling in a thyroid gland with an otherwise normal appearance. Thyroid nodules are common and may be caused by a variety of thyroid disorders. While most are benign, about 5 percent of all palpable nodules are malignant. 1–4 Many tests and procedures are available for evaluating thyroid nodules, and appropriate selection of tests is important for accurate diagnosis. Family physicians should have a cost-effective method of differentiating between nodules that are malignant and those that will have a benign course. This article provides a method for the outpatient evaluation and treatment of thyroid nodules. Presentation The majority of thyroid nodules are asymptomatic. Most persons with thyroid nodules are euthyroid, with less than 1 percent of nodules causing hyperthyroidism or thyrotoxicosis. Patients may complain of neck pressure or pain if spontaneous hemorrhage into the nodule has occurred.

Questions about symptoms of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism are essential, as are questions about any nodule, goiter, family history of autoimmune thyroid disease, thyroid carcinoma, or familial polyposis. The various types of thyroid nodules are listed in Table 1. Colloid nodules are the most common and do not have an increased risk of malignancy. Most follicular adenomas are benign; however, some may share features of follicular carcinoma. About 5 percent of microfollicular adenomas prove to be follicular cancers with careful study. 1 Thyroiditis also may present as a nodule. Thyroid carcinoma usually presents as a solitary palpable thyroid nodule. The most common type of malignant thyroid nodule is papillary carcinoma. Most incidental nodules found on routine testing with ultrasonography are benign and can be monitored with no further testing and follow-up observation.

However, FNA biopsy is indicated if the nodule becomes palpable, has findings suggestive of malignancy on ultrasonography, or is larger than 1. 5 cm, or if the patient has a history of head or neck irradiation or a strong family history of thyroid cancer.
5. 18 Use of TSH suppressive therapy with thyroxine to manage benign, solitary thyroid nodules remains controversial. The lack of universal efficacy makes such therapy optional in most patients. Some randomized, controlled studies.

ATA thyroid nodule/DTC guidelines — ultrasound (US) risk patterns and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) thresholds: High suspicion [malignancy risk 70%–90%] nodules with this pattern and measuring ≥ 1 cm "should undergo diagnostic fine-needle biopsy". Intermediate suspicion [malignancy risk 10%–20%] has "the highest sensitivity (60%–80%) for PTC", and "fine-needle biopsy should be considered for those nodules ≥ 1 cm". Low suspicion [malignancy risk 5%–10%] indicates that "If FNA is performed, the nodule should be at least 1.5 cm". Very low suspicion [< 3%] nodules: "If FNA is performed, the nodule should be at least 2 cm. Observation without FNA may also be considered for nodules ≥ 2 cm". Benign [≤ 1%] purely cystic nodules have FNA "not indicated for diagnostic purposes". For subcentimeter high-suspicion nodules without extrathyroidal extension or suspicious nodes, observation "may be" chosen, and age-related data from an observational series of 1235 Japanese patients show higher progression in younger patients "(5.9% vs. 2.2% for size increase; 5.3% vs. 0.4% for new nodal metastases, p < 0.05)", with "patient age and preference" modifying decisions.

American Thyroid Association — evaluation of multinodular thyroid glands: Patients with multiple thyroid nodules ≥ 1 cm should be evaluated like solitary nodules ≥ 1 cm, recognizing that each nodule > 1 cm may require fine-needle aspiration (FNA) (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). When multiple nodules ≥ 1 cm are present, FNA should be prioritized by nodule sonographic pattern and respective size cutoff (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). If no nodule has a high or moderate suspicion pattern and multiple similar very low or low suspicion nodules coalesce without intervening normal parenchyma, it is reasonable to aspirate the largest nodules (≥ 2 cm) or continue surveillance without FNA (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). In patients with low or low-normal serum TSH and multiple nodules, a radionuclide (preferably 123I) thyroid scan should be considered and compared to ultrasound (US) images to determine functionality of nodules ≥ 1 cm, and FNA should then be considered only for isofunctioning or nonfunctioning nodules, prioritizing those with high suspicion sonographic pattern for aspiration.

### Management guidelines for children with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer [^3bf73e3d]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Benign thyroid nodules — follow-up and surgical considerations (Recommendation 8) advise that "Benign lesions should be followed by serial US" and "undergo repeat FNA if suspicious features develop or the lesion continues to grow". For growing nodules "defined in adults as a ≥ 50% increase in volume or ≥ 20% increase in at least two dimensions", repeat fine-needle aspiration (FNA) should precede surgery. Because "FNA of nodules > 4 cm appears to have decreased sensitivity", "surgery could be considered for FNA-documented benign nodules > 4 cm, especially if they are solid", and "If surgery is undertaken, lobectomy is preferred to minimize the risk for complications". Lobectomy "may be preferred" for compressive or cosmetic concerns and "should be considered in all apparently benign solid thyroid nodules > 4 cm", in growing lesions, or when other clinical concerns for malignancy are present. Recommendation rating: B.

### Contemporary thyroid nodule evaluation and management [^5c0dbb5c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

After the initial diagnostic workup described, very few of the nodules (10.8%) will be subjected to surgery, but a high percentage of those that are resected will prove be malignant (73.1% of the resected nodules; 7.9% of all nodules). Some nodules (14.5%) will require a repeat biopsy, immediately or during the long-term follow-up, to be classified. For Bethesda II nodules, a second cytological assessment is indicated only if the US-based risk class increases during surveillance (frequency: ~15% over 5 years of follow-up). Three-quarters of all nodules (74.7%) will be classified as benign and managed with long-term sonographic surveillance. False negatives (usually the result of sampling errors) are uncommon (less than 3%), but repeat biopsy should be considered for high-suspicion nodules with Bethesda II cytology. Most of these nodules (≈85%) will remain asymptomatic with no signs of growth and will therefore not require any treatment. This estimate is based on findings from a 5-year prospective study of 1567 benign thyroid nodules, which have subsequently been confirmed by retrospective studies.

To address these shortcomings, several national and international professional organizations have developed US-based risk-stratification systems (often referred to as Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System or TIRADS, terms derived from those used for breast cancer imaging) that assign thyroid nodules to categories characterized by increasing risks (or risk ranges) for cancer, based on the presence or absence of the above-mentioned nodule features (Table 1).

Within each risk class, size cutoffs are used to identify lesions whose FNAB can safely be deferred. Avoiding unnecessary FNABs is an important goal. Aside from cost considerations, these procedures can be associated with complications, albeit minor and transient (e.g. mild bruising, soreness, swelling, neck discomfort). More important, inconclusive cytology results are by no means rare, and they often lead to additional testing (frequently quite expensive) and/or diagnostic surgery, undertaken for the purpose of confirming that the nodule is indeed benign. The accuracy of the risk estimates generated by the systems shown in Table 1 has in some cases been validated in retrospective and/or prospective studies, and their performance has also been confirmed by a recent meta-analysis. These classifications also guide the timing of subsequent long-term follow-up evaluations and the eligibility of suspicious nodules for management limited to active surveillance.

AACE/ACE/AME thyroid nodule management — medical therapy for FNA-benign nodules: Routine LT4 suppressive therapy for an FNA-benign nodule is not recommended. A clinically significant (> 50%) decrease in nodule volume is reported with LT4 therapy only in a minority of patients, and in iodine-deficient regions this favorable effect appears more convincing with the concomitant administration of iodine supplements. Although long-term thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression may prevent an increase in nodule or thyroid size, nodule regrowth occurs after cessation and long-term therapy seems inevitable, and TSH-suppressive therapy with LT4 is reported as not useful for prevention of goiter recurrence after lobectomy in patients with normal TSH levels by most. Safety signals include a decrease in bone density in postmenopausal females and an increase in major osteoporotic fractures with sustained subclinical hyperthyroidism, a higher risk of atrial fibrillation in elderly patients with suppressed TSH levels, and overall mortality appears increased.

### Evidence-based assessment of the role of ultrasonography in the management of benign thyroid nodules [^e8455ae3]. World Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Although ultrasonographic (US) evaluation is currently recommended for the workup of all palpable thyroid nodules, little guidance exists regarding the manner in which US data are to be used. Herein, we examine the available evidence and recommend how US can be used most effectively to predict malignancy. We discuss the role of US-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) and other special topics regarding US evaluation and management of benign nodules.

Methods

We also present a systematic review of the literature using evidence-based criteria.

Results

US features alone cannot predict malignancy or benignity, but techniques that combine US features and FNA cytology are most effective and most accurate for predicting malignancy (Level III and IV evidence). US features suggesting malignancy include a blurred or ill-defined margin, irregular shape, solid echo structure, hypoechogenicity, absent halo, fine calcifications, and intranodular vascular pattern. Most patients with malignancies have more than two US features characteristic of malignancy. US-guided FNA has nonsignificantly higher sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy than the palpation-guided technique (Level III and IV evidence). US guidance is particularly beneficial in patients with nonpalpable, multiple, or heterogeneous nodules for preferentially aspirating a specific segment of the nodule (large or partially cystic nodule) or when nodule palpation is difficult (patients with diffuse glandular disease or obesity).

Conclusions

US is an essential component of thyroid nodule evaluation and management. Techniques that combine US features and FNA cytology for thyroid nodule workup are more accurate than either technique alone. US-guided FNA can decrease the rate of nondiagnostic aspirates.

### Pharmacotherapy for thyroid nodules. A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1761e04d]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The review highlights the uncertainty in the management of nodular thyroid disease. Thyroxine suppressive treatment is given in the hope that nodules might decrease in size, sometimes assuming that dependency on TSH is different in benign and malignant nodular disease. Follow-up of benign nodules over 10 years suggested that most remain the same, shrink, or disappear [14]. TSH suppression may lead to hyperthyroidism, reduced bone density [37.39], and atrial fibrilation; however, apart from reduction of nodule size or arrest in nodule growth, thyroxine therapy may benefit patients by reducing perinodular volume. Consequently, both pressure symptoms and cosmetic complaints could improve. Unfortunately, no information concerning symptoms or well-being is available from published randomized trials. In conclusion, more high quality studies of sufficient duration with adequate power estimation are needed. Uncertainty about predictors of response or the impact on outcomes that are important to patients leaves considerable doubt about the wisdom of applying suppressive therapy. Future studies shoudl include patient-important outcomes including thyroid cancer incidence, health-related quality of life and costs.

Thyroid nodule fine-needle aspiration (FNA) indications — ultrasonography (US)-guided and size/feature thresholds — state that thyroid FNA should always be performed under US guidance; nodules < 5 mm should be monitored with US rather than biopsied; FNA should be considered for nodules with a major diameter ≤ 5–10 mm only when suspicious US signs are present in association with pathologic lymph nodes or extrathyroidal spread; FNA is also appropriate with a personal or family history of thyroid cancer or suspicious clinical or imaging findings; FNA should be performed on nodules > 10 mm lacking suspicious US and/or clinical findings but without a definite benign appearance; for spongiform, isohyperechoic, or predominantly (> 50%) cystic nodules without suspicious US findings, FNA should be performed only when nodules are ≥ 20 mm or progressively increasing in size; functioning nodules on scintigraphy without suspicious US features can be excluded from FNA.

Thyroid nodule cytology — Benign (Thyroid 2) is the most common cytologic finding, with a range in different series from 54 to 74% of cases, and the risk of malignancy in benign lesions is reported as 0 to 3.7%. These data are influenced by the small percentage (usually about 10%) of cytologically benign nodules that are submitted for surgical procedure, and in centers with expertise in thyroid cytologic evaluation the overall risk of malignancy of nodules benign at FNA is expected to be about 1% and decreases further with repeated FNA.
