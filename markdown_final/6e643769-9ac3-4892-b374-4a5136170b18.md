## Question

How does methane production affect the interpretation of fructose breath tests?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how methane production affects the interpretation of fructose breath tests. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the basic principles and standard cutoffs for fructose breath testing. Then, I should consider the role of methanogenic archaea and the hydrogen "sink effect". Next, I will verify how methane alters hydrogen signals and why guidelines require simultaneous methane measurement. After that, I should confirm the diagnostic thresholds and the distinction between intestinal methanogen overgrowth and SIBO. Then, I will review sequencing with SIBO testing to avoid false positives, consider combined gas thresholds, and correlate with symptom phenotypes and treatment. Finally, I need to check pediatric nuances and synthesize a practical interpretation framework backed by consensus statements and data [^111vPQV3] [^111zqCvJ].

> Let me first confirm the basic principle of the fructose breath test: unabsorbed fructose reaching the colon is fermented by microbes that produce hydrogen, and because human cells do not generate hydrogen, a rise of hydrogen by at least 20 ppm from baseline during the test is taken as evidence of maldigestion or malabsorption, typically using a 25 g fructose dose and sampling for up to 3 hours [^114eYWVS] [^116hBVpi] [^112HDS59].

> Now, I need to consider who else is in the lumen and could alter this signal; specifically, methanogenic archaea consume hydrogen to produce methane via the reaction 4 H2 + CO2 → CH4 + 2 H2O, creating a hydrogen "sink" that can depress measured breath hydrogen while increasing methane and allowing continued fermentation by hydrogen producers, a syntrophic interplay that changes gas profiles during testing [^116LCLPw] [^111J3TNZ] [^114mEdTf].

> Wait, let me verify the direct implication of that sink effect for test interpretation: if methanogens are abundant, hydrogen generated from colonic fermentation of unabsorbed fructose may be rapidly converted to methane, so breath hydrogen may fail to reach the ≥ 20 ppm threshold despite true malabsorption, yielding a false-negative hydrogen result unless methane is measured in parallel; this is precisely why consensus statements recommend measuring hydrogen, methane, and CO2 simultaneously for all breath tests [^116nv63o] [^116LCLPw] [^111vPQV3].

> Hold on, I should confirm the methane threshold and nomenclature before proceeding; the North American Consensus and ACG guidance define methane positivity as a breath methane level ≥ 10 ppm at any point, and importantly, excess methane reflects intestinal methanogen overgrowth rather than SIBO because methanogens are archaea, not bacteria, a distinction that matters for diagnosis and treatment planning [^111vPQV3] [^111zqCvJ] [^114eYWVS].

> Let me think about sequencing and confounding next, because I should ensure we avoid false-positive fructose tests; SIBO should be ruled out first with a glucose or lactulose breath test, as proximal small bowel fermentation can generate an early gas rise that mimics fructose malabsorption, and indeed, eradication of SIBO with antibiotics has been shown to dramatically reduce positive fructose tests in IBS cohorts, underscoring this order of operations [^113mASEr] [^116hBVpi].

> Next, I should review how to integrate both gases in practice; if methane is consistently below 10 ppm, I would interpret fructose testing primarily by the hydrogen rise of ≥ 20 ppm, but if methane is ≥ 10 ppm, I need to recognize a methane producer in whom the lack of a hydrogen rise does not exclude malabsorption because of the hydrogen sink, and while some adopt a combined hydrogen plus methane cutoff around 18 ppm in specific settings, adult guidelines generally treat methane ≥ 10 ppm as a separate positive criterion and emphasize clinical correlation, especially given the association of methane with constipation and the potential for IMO-directed therapy, including neomycin plus rifaximin in methane-predominant cases [^1141cgKk] [^111vPQV3] [^114LXyr8] [^114jhTKD].

> Hmm, wait a minute, do pediatric data align with adult practice; one pediatric cohort suggested that adding methane measurement did not meaningfully change the diagnosis of carbohydrate malabsorption unless an unusually low combined hydrogen plus methane cutoff was used, a discrepancy likely reflecting a lower prevalence of methanogens in children compared with adults, among whom roughly one-third are methane producers, reinforcing the adult requirement to measure both gases [^1141cgKk] [^112HDS59].

> Let me now integrate and summarize so I don't miss anything critical; methanogens lower luminal hydrogen by converting it to methane, potentially masking a diagnostic hydrogen rise and producing false-negative hydrogen-only fructose tests, so concurrent methane measurement is necessary, methane ≥ 10 ppm defines methane positivity consistent with intestinal methanogen overgrowth rather than SIBO, and in methane producers a flat hydrogen response does not exclude fructose malabsorption, making symptom correlation and the broader clinical phenotype — particularly constipation — crucial for management, all while remembering to exclude SIBO first to avoid false-positive fructose interpretations due to proximal fermentation [^111vPQV3] [^111zqCvJ] [^116LCLPw] [^116hBVpi].

---

Methane production by gut methanogens can mask hydrogen rises on fructose breath tests, causing false negatives if only hydrogen is measured [^116LCLPw]. Methanogens consume hydrogen to produce methane, so hydrogen may stay low despite malabsorption; therefore, measure both gases [^114iWzpP] and use a methane threshold of ≥ 10 ppm [^111vPQV3] to improve detection and avoid misclassification.

---

## Methane production and hydrogen consumption

Methanogens, mainly Methanobrevibacter smithii, consume hydrogen to produce methane [^116LCLPw], reducing exhaled hydrogen and potentially causing false negatives if only hydrogen is measured [^114mEdTf]. Methane production is also associated with slower intestinal transit [^114LXyr8] and constipation, further confounding breath test interpretation [^1115KfQx].

---

## Impact on fructose breath test interpretation

In fructose breath testing, methane production consumes hydrogen to produce methane [^114mEdTf], which can lead to false negatives if only hydrogen is measured [^116hBVpi]. Methane producers may also show elevated baseline methane [^1161m2x9] with minimal hydrogen rise, complicating interpretation [^112UcBj8].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Measure hydrogen, methane, and CO2** simultaneously during breath testing to improve accuracy [^116nv63o].

- **Interpret methane ≥ 10 ppm as positive** for intestinal methanogen overgrowth (IMO) [^114eYWVS] [^111vPQV3].

- Recognize that **excessive methane does not indicate SIBO**, as methanogens are archaea; use the term IMO [^111zqCvJ].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Methane production is **linked to constipation and slower transit** [^113m1pJH]; consider IMO in methane-positive patients with constipation [^111bdD9E] [^1115KfQx]. Treatment may require targeted antibiotics (e.g. rifaximin plus neomycin) [^114jhTKD] to reduce methane and improve symptoms [^112EuAZL].

## Summary of key points

| **Key point** | **Clinical implication** |
|-|-|
| Methanogens consume hydrogen | Potential false negatives if only hydrogen is measured |
| Methane ≥ 10 ppm | Positive for IMO |
| Methane linked to constipation | Consider IMO in methane-positive patients with constipation |
| Measure hydrogen, methane, and CO2 | Improves accuracy and reduces misclassification |

---

Methane production can mask hydrogen rises on fructose breath tests, causing false negatives if only hydrogen is measured [^116LCLPw]; **measuring both gases** and using a methane threshold of ≥ 10 ppm [^111vPQV3] improves accuracy and reduces misclassification.

### Breath methane positivity is more common and higher in patients with objectively proven delayed transit constipation [^115gxBqR]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

This study was conducted to evaluate the association between methane (CH4) levels in breath, colonic transit, and anorectal pressure in constipated patients, as CH4-producing intestinal bacteria might be related to constipation.

- **Methods**: A database of 62 consecutive constipated patients, meeting the Rome III criteria, underwent the lactulose CH4 breath test (LMBT), a colon marker study, and anorectal manometry. These profiles were compared with 49 healthy controls. LMBT positivity (LMBT+) was defined as CH4 levels of at least 10 ppm at baseline or above baseline within 90 minutes. The study classified constipation into normal and delayed transit types.

- **Results**: Significant differences were observed in breath CH4 levels between patients with delayed transit and those with normal transit from 0 to 135 minutes or healthy controls from 0 to 180 minutes. LMBT+ was more prevalent in delayed transit patients than in healthy controls (58.8% vs. 12.2%) or normal transit patients (13.3%), respectively (P < 0.01). Delayed transit was identified as the sole independent factor for LMBT+ with an odds ratio of 27.8 (95% confidence interval: 3.32–250.00, P < 0.01). Compared to LMBT-negative patients, those with LMBT-positive results had significantly longer left and total colonic transit times. Correlations were found between total CH4 levels and left or total colonic transit times, though no differences were noted in anorectal manometry parameters based on LMBT status.

- **Conclusion**: Positive breath CH4 was associated with delayed colonic transit and could represent a new therapeutic target for managing constipation.

The interpretation of breath tests with elevated baseline H₂ > 20 p.p.m. is not clear. Further studies are needed to clarify whether this is the result of lack of adherence to diet and fasting or in fact representative of a SIBO variant. The interpretation of breath tests with no CH₄ and low fixed H₂ production remains unclear. Such breath tests have been suggested to be due to an abundance of H₂S-producing bacteria, which cannot be detected using currently available gas chromatography devices. Further studies are needed to clarify the significance of such a pattern.

The optimal criterion to define excessive methane production is not clear. The production pattern of methane and hydrogen are different on breath testing. Unlike hydrogen, subjects with excessive methane production elicit an elevated methane level at baseline, and the rise of methane during breath testing is not as sharp as hydrogen gas. Hence, using the same cutoff as hydrogen for methane is not advised. Recently, it has been shown that a fasting level of ≥ 5 and ≥ 10 p.p.m. can respectively predict excessive methane production with specificity of 99.7% and 100%, while sensitivity was 96.1% and 86.4%. The sensitivity threshold of many commercially available gas chromatography instruments is 3 p.p.m., and as such, this is the lowest value that could be considered positive. Using a combination of a rise in hydrogen > 20 p.p.m. and > 5 p.p.m. of methane, the sensitivity of the breath test was lower at ≥ 10³ (42%) compared to ≥ 10⁵ c.f.u./ml (56%), whereas specificity was higher at ≥ 10³ (85%) compared to ≥ 10⁵ c.f.u./ml (78%).

### Methanogens and hydrogen sulfide producing bacteria guide distinct gut microbe profiles and irritable bowel syndrome subtypes [^117Whxbg]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

We found a clear relationship between breath test results and the gut microbiome, with each being a predictor of IBS phenotypes. There were significant associations between CH₄ on the breath test, gut colonization with *M. smithii*, and IBS-C. Microbial metabolic pathway analysis also revealed a correlation between the KEGG module, which predicts the biosynthesis of F420 (an important coenzyme in methane production), and breath CH₄ in IBS-C/CH₄+ subjects. Interestingly, there was also an inverse relationship between CH₄ and H₂ levels, which may be consistent with the syntrophic relationship between fermenting bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens.

Fermenting bacteria break down carbohydrates (including the lactulose or glucose substrates provided during breath testing), producing H₂ and short-chain fatty acids. However, accumulation of H₂ beyond certain levels inhibits bacterial growth. Hydrogenotrophic methanogens, such as *M. smithii*, use H₂ to generate CH₄, reducing H₂ levels and increasing CH₄ levels. The reduction in H₂, in turn, facilitates the continued growth of fermenting bacteria, benefiting both syntrophs.

### Metabolic effects of eradicating breath methane using antibiotics in prediabetic subjects with obesity [^112EuAZL]. Obesity (2016). Low credibility.

Methanogens colonizing the human gut produce methane and influence host metabolism. This study examined metabolic parameters in methane-producing subjects before and after antibiotic treatment.

- **Methods**: Eleven prediabetic methane-positive subjects (9F, 2M) with obesity (BMI 35.17 ± 7.71 kg/m²) aged 47 ± 9 years were recruited. Subjects underwent breath testing, symptom questionnaire, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), lipid profile, and stool Methanobrevibacter smithii levels, gastric transit, and energy utilization analyses. After a 10-day antibiotic therapy (neomycin 500 mg bid/rifaximin 550 mg tid), all testing was repeated.

- **Results**: Baseline stool M. smithii levels correlated with breath methane (R = 0.7, P = 0.05). Eight subjects (73%) eradicated breath methane and showed reduced stool M. smithii (P = 0.16). After therapy, methane-eradicated subjects showed significant improvements in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (P = 0.028), total cholesterol (P = 0.01), and insulin levels on OGTT (P = 0.05 at 120 minutes), lower blood glucose levels on OGTT (P = 0.054 at 90 minutes), significant reductions in bloating (P = 0.018) and straining (P = 0.059), and a trend toward lower stool dry weight. No changes were detected in gastric emptying time or energy harvest.

- **Conclusions**: Breath methane eradication and M. smithii reduction are associated with significant improvements in total cholesterol, LDL, and insulin levels and with lower glucose levels in prediabetic subjects with obesity. The underlying mechanisms require further elucidation.

### Hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders: The North American consensus [^116vpBFT]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

SIBO is a condition in which the small bowel is colonized by excessive numbers of aerobic and anaerobic microbes that are normally found in the large intestine. Aspiration of small bowel fluid, followed by culture and bacterial count, is considered to be the gold standard for the diagnosis of SIBO. Unlike breath testing, small bowel aspiration is invasive, time-consuming, and costly. In addition, small bowel aspiration has multiple shortcomings. The mid and distal segments of the small bowel are beyond the reach of regular endoscopes; therefore, proximal small bowel aspirates may be falsely negative. Although aseptic techniques for small bowel aspirates have been described, contamination with oral and esophageal flora may lead to a significant number of false-positive results. Quantitative PCR studies have been used to diagnose SIBO with promising results; however, such techniques are not readily available for clinical practice.

### Diagnostic reliability of glucose and lactulose breath tests: Insights from a test-retest study in healthy adults [^113ESNYi]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Low credibility.

Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and intestinal methanogen overgrowth (IMO) are commonly diagnosed using glucose (GBT) and lactulose (LBT) breath tests. Despite their widespread use, concerns remain regarding their reproducibility and reliability, especially in asymptomatic individuals. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic variability and test-retest reliability of GBT and LBT in healthy volunteers.

- **Methods**: We conducted a prospective observational diagnostic concordance study in 40 healthy adults. Participants underwent both GBT (75g glucose) and LBT (10g lactulose) with hydrogen (H₂) and methane (CH₄) measured at 15-minute intervals. Testing was repeated 2 weeks later. A positive result was defined as an increase of ≥ 20 ppm in H₂ or a CH₄ level of ≥ 10 ppm at any point during the breath testing. Symptoms were recorded during the tests. Agreement and reliability were assessed using kappa statistics and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), respectively.

- **Results**: At baseline, 15.0% of participants had a positive GBT and 60.0% had a positive LBT, predominantly for H₂. In the retest, 10.0% remained GBT-positive, whereas LBT results were consistent (60.0%). ICC for GBT was 0.56 for H₂ and 0.87 for CH₄; for LBT, ICCs were 0.88 and 0.85, respectively. Symptoms occurred more frequently with LBT, and the median time to symptom onset (75 minutes) coincided with physiological orocecal transit.

- **Conclusions**: GBT and LBT showed good test-retest reliability in healthy individuals. However, the high rate of positive LBT results and symptom occurrences suggest further investigation is needed.

Breath tests are also used in the diagnosis of a variety of carbohydrate maldigestion syndromes. The lactose breath test is performed to diagnose lactose maldigestion/intolerance, which may result from lactase deficiency. Lactose, which is exclusively found in dairy products, is a disaccharide composed of galactose and glucose, and the brush border enzyme lactase phlorizin hydrolase is required for its digestion. Lactase deficiency can be primary or secondary (i.e. acquired lactase deficiency due to damage to or absence of the brush border).

There is no gold standard test to diagnose lactose maldigestion, and large-scale data are lacking to compare the degree of agreement of the currently available tests. Jejunal biopsies followed by a lactase activity assay are invasive and unreliable due to patchy lactase distribution in the brush border. Genetic testing only detects primary lactase deficiency, and tests of blood glucose levels following lactose ingestion depend on glucose metabolism and are not reliable. One other limitation of the lactose breath test is false negative results in individuals with fixed hydrogen and non-methane production; however, these only constitute 3.4% of breath tests. As mentioned above, false positive results can also occur.

### Hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders: The North American consensus [^114LXyr8]. The American journal of gastroenterology (2017). High credibility.

A recent retrospective study of subjects undergoing glucose breath testing with scintigraphy concluded that glucose breath testing has a high false positive rate due to the arrival of the scintigraphy in the cecum prior to a rise in hydrogen or methane on testing. This is similar to conclusions previously published pertaining to lactulose breath testing. However, both of these studies rely on the arrival of technetium to the cecum as a determinant of oro-cecal transit — either 5% arrival of technetium in the cecum, or the "head of the labeled bolus". If 5% of the lactulose or "the head of the bolus" is in the cecum, the rest of the medium is still in the small intestine; hence, the rise of breath gases is not necessarily due to fermentation in the cecum. Moreover, the lag time between colonic flora exposure to sugar and the peak of bacterial fermentation was not taken into account in these studies, and as such, they do not yet provide a clear answer on the validity of these breath tests.

Methane gas has been shown to inhibit intestinal transit in dogs by 59%, and in human subjects, CH4 positivity on breath tests has been associated with constipation. Patients with CH4-predominant bacterial overgrowth usually present with bloating and abdominal distention. However, they are 5 times more likely to have constipation as opposed to H2-predominant overgrowth. Moreover, the severity of constipation directly correlates with the methane level, and the choice of antibiotics for the treatment of SIBO differs between these two groups as the predominant methanogen in the human gut.

### Evidence-based and emerging diet recommendations for small bowel disorders [^112HDS59]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

To overcome the limitations of the culture-dependent methods for diagnosing SIBO, indirect tests, specifically breath tests, were developed. Quantification of hydrogen and methane gas in breath samples remains the most inexpensive, noninvasive, simple, and widely available test for diagnosing SIBO. Human cells are not capable of producing hydrogen or methane gas. The presence of these gases in human breath indicates the metabolism of nondigested carbohydrates by gut microbes. Currently, the most used substrates are glucose and lactulose. The North American consensus statement on hydrogen and methane breath testing defines a rise over baseline of ≥ 20 parts per million for hydrogen by 90 minutes or a level of ≥ 10 parts per million in methane as a positive result consistent with the diagnosis of SIBO. Because more than one-third of healthy adult subjects are predominantly methane producers, it is important to measure both hydrogen and methane during breath tests.

The recent American College of Gastroenterology guidelines have coined the term "intestinal methanogen overgrowth", emphasizing the importance of methane production by methanogens belonging to the domain Archaea rather than SIBO driven solely by bacteria. Hydrogen sulphide breath testing may be a potential biomarker for SIBO but requires validation.

However, breath tests also have several limitations. Overall, the sensitivity and specificity of breath tests for diagnosing SIBO are poor. Compared with the gold standard of small bowel aspiration and culture, the glucose breath test has a sensitivity of…

### Detection of bacterial overgrowth in IBS using the lactulose H2 breath test: comparison with 14C-D-xylose and healthy controls [^115qpvdj]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Recent reports suggest bacterial overgrowth is commonly associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) when diagnosed using the lactulose hydrogen breath test (LHBT). We employed this test to examine whether similar findings exist in a geographically distinct population of Rome II positive IBS patients and compared it to the 14C-D-xylose breath test, a test with acknowledged greater specificity for bacterial overgrowth.

- **Methods**: In the first series, Rome II IBS patients underwent a 10 g lactulose breath test and a standardized 1 g 14C-D-xylose breath test and answered IBS symptom questionnaires. A positive test required an elevated breath hydrogen concentration within 90 minutes, two distinct peaks, and an increase > 20 ppm. In a second series, control patients lacking gastrointestinal symptoms underwent a lactulose breath test. A positive test required an elevation of breath hydrogen > 20 ppm within 90 or 180 minutes. These criteria were also applied to lactulose breath tests from IBS cases in series one.

- **Results**: The IBS patients were predominantly female (64%) and most reported severe symptoms (80%). The majority had diarrhea predominant symptoms (63%) and only 3% were constipation predominant. In the first series, only 10% of patients had a positive lactulose breath test and 13% had a positive 14C-D-xylose test. In the second series, the number of abnormal LHBTs was much higher, but no differences were found between IBS patients and controls.

### ACG clinical guideline: Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth [^115PjER7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, more specifically with respect to breath testing, the ACG 2020 guidelines recommend considering obtaining glucose hydrogen or lactulose hydrogen breath testing for the diagnosis of SIBO in patients with:

- **Irritable bowel disease**: Indications are especially pertinent in cases presenting with IBS.

- **Suspected motility disorders**: These disorders can complicate the gastrointestinal transit, necessitating such testing.

- **Abdominal pain, gas, bloating, and/or diarrhea**: Especially following previous luminal abdominal surgery, these symptoms warrant a consideration for breath testing for SIBO.

### Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth [^113fTLMd]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2021). High credibility.

Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth can be associated with a variety of symptoms and conditions. These include abdominal pain, malnutrition, diverticular disease, steatorrhea, small bowel stricture, and positive methane breath test results. Patients may also experience anemia, rosacea, bloating, abdominal discomfort, positive xylose breath test results, diarrhea, and radiation enteritis. Additional associations include positive hydrogen breath test results, systemic sclerosis, vitamin B12 deficiency, fatigue, gastrointestinal fistula, flatulence, the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), history of small bowel surgery, and weight loss.

### Hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders: The North American consensus [^117JkfBc]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Distinct topics of discussion included indications, preparation, performance, interpretations of results, and future directions in breath testing. Based on the results of these discussions, a series of draft consensus statements was compiled and sent to committee members for online voting using SurveyMonkey (SurveyMonkey, Palo Alto, CA) with revision as necessary. Using a modified Delphi process, group members anonymously voted on their level of agreement with each statement on a scale of 1–3 (disagree, uncertain, and agree, respectively).

A statement was accepted if more than 70% of participants voted 3 (agree), and it was rejected if more than 50% voted 1 (disagree). If neither criterion was reached, it was stated that "a firm position statement could not be reached due to lack of conclusive data".

The strength of recommendation for each statement was assigned by the consensus group as either strong ("we recommend") or weak ("we suggest"). The strength of each statement was based on resource and cost benefit, patients' values, risk/benefit balance, and quality of evidence. The quality of evidence for each consensus statement was classified as high (⊕⊕⊕⊕), moderate (⊕⊕⊕), low (⊕⊕⊙), or very low (⊕⊙⊙⊙) based on the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) system.

The manuscript was circulated to all group members for review, revisions, and approval.

### Hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders: The North American consensus [^1114a5LL]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

In addition to the aforementioned consensus statements, the committee identified the following gaps in knowledge and technology in breath testing:

- **Lack of a validated gold standard test**: There is currently no validated gold standard test for diagnosing small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO).

- **Techniques for obtaining sterile aspirates**: There is a lack of techniques capable of acquiring sterile and anaerobic aspirates from various segments of the small bowel.

- **Deep sequencing techniques**: Integration of deep sequencing techniques is needed for further assessment of bacterial diversity in SIBO patients.

- **Optimal doses for testing**: The optimal doses of lactose for breath testing, as well as the optimal test duration, have not been determined.

- **Pediatric substrate doses**: Research is needed to determine various substrate doses in the pediatric population.

- **Demographic assessment of results**: It is important to assess breath testing results in relation to race, ethnicity, age, and gender.

- **Effect of pre/probiotics**: There is a need to determine the effect of pre/probiotics on hydrogen and methane production.

- **Effect of antibiotics**: Determining the extent of the effect of absorbable and non-absorbable antibiotics on breath testing results is necessary.

- **Role of breath testing post-therapy**: Further investigation is needed into the role of breath testing in the assessment of SIBO after therapy.

- **Non-methane hydrogen pattern**: Determination of the cause of non-methane fixed-hydrogen pattern (i.e. flatline) is required.

- **Baseline hydrogen levels**: The significance of elevated baseline hydrogen levels despite fasting and adherence to a pre-test diet needs to be determined.

- **Optimal sampling intervals**: Determining the optimal time interval for breath test sampling during breath testing is needed.

- **Impact of diet**: Studies should determine whether different diets in different parts of the world affect the results of breath tests and if a universal standardized pre-breath test diet is necessary.

- **Gas chromatographers for H₂S detection**: Development of gas chromatographers capable of detecting H₂S in exhaled air is necessary, as this is another potentially important gas.

### Associations between postprandial symptoms, hydrogen and methane production, and transit time in irritable bowel syndrome [^115ZGrZ2]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). Low credibility.

Abnormal oroanal transit time (OATT) and visceral hypersensitivity are key pathophysiological factors in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The lactulose nutrient challenge test (LNCT) has been developed to assess postprandial symptoms and gut microbial fermentation. We aimed to investigate associations between OATT, rectal sensitivity, and LNCT in IBS patients.

- **Methods**: We included 263 IBS patients from two study cohorts, where the link between pathophysiology and symptoms was investigated. During the LNCT, severity of postprandial symptoms was graded, and breath hydrogen/methane concentrations were measured after ingestion of a combined lactulose nutrient drink every 15 minutes for four hours. The patients underwent rectal sensitivity (rectal barostat) and OATT (radiopaque markers) investigations. Comorbid conditions, including functional dyspepsia, anxiety, depression, and somatization, were assessed using questionnaires.

- **Key results**: After controlling for comorbid conditions, rectal sensitivity was associated with abdominal pain (p < 0.05). More rapid OATT was associated with higher severity of abdominal discomfort, rumbling, nausea, and urgency (p < 0.05 for all), both pre- and post-prandially. Postprandial nausea, urgency, and abdominal pain changed differently over time depending on OATT (p < 0.05 for all). OATT, but not rectal sensitivity, was associated with hydrogen and methane concentrations (p = 0.002 for both). Trajectories over time of postprandial symptoms and exhaled hydrogen/methane concentrations were correlated, with different correlations depending on OATT.

### What defines a healthy gut microbiome [^115C44HL]. Gut (2024). Low credibility.

The production of various gases, such as hydrogen, methane, and hydrogen sulfide, is a significant indicator of gut health and microbial composition. These gases are by-products of microbial fermentation processes in the gut. Hydrogen and methane are primarily produced by bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates, with methane production being specifically linked to the activity of methanogenic archaea. Hydrogen sulfide, on the other hand, is produced from the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids by specific bacteria.

The measurement of these gases has been used in clinical settings to diagnose conditions like SIBO and IBS. The rationale for using gas production as a marker is grounded in the fact that specific gas profiles can indicate particular microbial activities and imbalances. For instance, elevated methane levels and methane-producing organisms have been associated with constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C), while elevated breath levels of hydrogen and hydrogen sulfide, as well as a higher relative abundance of hydrogen sulfide-producing bacteria, have been found in individuals suffering from diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D).

The advantages of using gas production as markers include non-invasive breath tests, which are relatively easy to administer and interpret. However, there are limitations, such as the influence of diet, transit time, and individual variability in gas production. Furthermore, interpreting these gases can be complex due to the overlapping symptoms of different GI conditions.

### Breath methane excretion is not an accurate marker of colonic methane production in irritable bowel syndrome [^117T7pKJ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

The role of colonic methane production in functional bowel disorders is still uncertain. In small samples of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients, it was shown that methane breath excretion correlates with clinical presentation and delayed gastrointestinal transit time. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between intestinal production and breath excretion of CH₄ and to correlate CH₄ production with the presence and the severity of symptoms, in a large cohort of IBS patients and in a group of healthy volunteers.

A group of 103 IBS patients and a group of 28 healthy volunteers were enrolled. The presence and severity of symptoms and gastrointestinal transit were evaluated in all subjects, who underwent breath H₂/CH₄ measurement for 7 hours after lactulose to identify breath excretors of these gases. H₂ and CH₄ were also measured in rectal samples to identify colonic producers. Cumulative H₂ and CH₄ excretion and production were evaluated by the area under the time-concentration curve calculation (AUC).

In IBS patients, CH₄ was detected in rectal samples in 48 patients (47%), but only 27 of them (26% of the 103 enrolled patients) excreted this gas with breath. In CH₄ producers, the prevalence and severity of symptoms and gastrointestinal transit time were not significantly different with respect to non-producers. IBS subtypes were homogeneously represented in CH₄ producers and in non-producers. Healthy volunteers, compared with IBS patients, showed a significantly lower prevalence of CH₄ excretion.

### A combination of rifaximin and neomycin is most effective in treating irritable bowel syndrome patients with methane on lactulose breath test [^114jhTKD]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

There is a growing interest in methane and its association with constipation in functional bowel disease. Neomycin-based treatment of methane-positive subjects has resulted in improvement of constipation. Rifaximin, although superior for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome compared with other antibiotics, seems less effective in methane-positive subjects. In this study, we evaluate three different antibiotic treatments in patients who have a methane-positive breath test: rifaximin only, neomycin only, and the combination of neomycin and rifaximin.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review was conducted on patients with methane on their lactulose breath test (≥ 3 ppm of methane) who received one of the following antibiotic treatments: 500 mg b.i.d. for 10 days of neomycin alone, 400 mg t.i.d. for 10 days of rifaximin alone, or a combination of both rifaximin and neomycin for 10 days. All patients must have received antibiotic treatment after their initial consultation at the medical center and, in addition, had at least one follow-up to evaluate the effects of the treatment. After inclusion/exclusion criteria were met, all charts were evaluated to determine if the subject was a responder to the antibiotic therapy. This included clinical symptom improvement and eradication of methane on their breath test.

- **Results**: Of the subjects receiving the treatment of rifaximin and neomycin (n = 27), 85% had a clinical response, compared with 63% of subjects in the neomycin only group (n = 8) (P = 0.15) and 56% of subjects in the rifaximin only group (n = 39) (P = 0.01) when comparing the results.

### Methanogens and hydrogen sulfide producing bacteria guide distinct gut microbe profiles and irritable bowel syndrome subtypes [^111J3TNZ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) includes diarrhea-predominant (IBS-D) and constipation-predominant (IBS-C) subtypes. We combined breath testing and stool microbiome sequencing to identify potential microbial drivers of IBS subtypes.

- **Methods**: IBS-C and IBS-D subjects from two randomized controlled trials (NCT03763175 and NCT04557215) were included. Baseline breath carbon dioxide, hydrogen (H₂), methane (CH₄), and hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) levels were measured by gas chromatography. Baseline stool microbiome composition was analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Microbial metabolic pathways were analyzed using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes collection databases.

- **Results**: IBS-C subjects had higher breath CH₄, which correlated with higher gut microbial diversity and higher relative abundance (RA) of stool methanogens, predominantly Methanobrevibacter, as well as higher absolute abundance of Methanobrevibacter smithii in stool. IBS-D subjects had higher breath H₂, which correlated with lower microbial diversity, and higher breath H₂S, which correlated with higher RA of H₂S-producing bacteria, including Fusobacterium and Desulfovibrio spp. The predominant H₂ producers were different in these distinct microtypes, with higher RA of Ruminococcaceae and Christensenellaceae in IBS-C/CH₄+ (which correlated with Methanobacteriaceae RA) and higher Enterobacteriaceae RA in IBS-D. Finally, microbial metabolic pathway analysis revealed enrichment of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes modules associated with methanogenesis and biosynthesis of methanogenesis co-factors.

### Scintigraphy demonstrates high rate of false-positive results from glucose breath tests for small bowel bacterial overgrowth [^113KLUiv]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

The breath tests for hydrogen and/or methane are utilized to detect small bowel bacterial overgrowth (SBBO), yet false-positive results can occur due to clinical conditions that hasten small bowel transit, leading to the delivery of unabsorbed glucose to the colon. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of false-positive outcomes from glucose breath tests by also evaluating patients with scintigraphy.

In a retrospective study, data from glucose breath tests performed with conScintigraphy on 139 patients with suspected SBBO at the Medical College of Wisconsin from January 2003 through July 2013 were reviewed. Breath test results were deemed abnormal, or positive, if there was an increasing curve of hydrogen or methane by more than 15 parts per million above baseline within 90 minutes. Scintigraphy was employed to determine whether this increase occurred before or after the glucose bolus reached the cecum. A separate analysis was conducted on data from 45 patients with prior upper gastrointestinal surgery.

Forty-six patients (33%) exhibited abnormal results from breath tests. Based on scintigraphy findings, 22 of these patients (48%) had false-positive results, attributed to colon fermentation of unabsorbed glucose. False-positive results due to colonic fermentation occurred in 65% of patients who had undergone upper gastrointestinal surgery and in 13% of patients without prior surgery. Patients with false-positive results caused by colonic fermentation exhibited shorter mean oro-cecal transit times (18 minutes) compared with those having positive breath-test results.

### Evaluation of the rice breath hydrogen test for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth [^113aTFxi]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2000). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study were to document the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of the rice breath hydrogen test for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth; determine the possible influence of gastric bacterial overgrowth and gastroduodenal pH on the efficacy of this test; and investigate whether reliability is limited by an inability of small intestinal luminal flora to ferment rice or its product of hydrolysis, maltose.

- **Methods**: Twenty adult subjects were investigated with microbiological culture of proximal small intestinal aspirate and a 3-g/kg rice breath hydrogen test. Gastroduodenal pH, the presence or absence of gastric bacterial overgrowth, and the in vitro capability of small intestinal luminal flora to ferment rice and maltose, its product of hydrolysis, were determined.

- **Results**: Sensitivity of the rice breath hydrogen test for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth was 33% and remained low even when subjects with small intestinal overgrowth with oropharyngeal-type (38%) and colonic-type flora (20%) and those with small intestinal and gastric bacterial overgrowth (40%) were considered separately. Sensitivity remained suboptimal despite favorable gastroduodenal luminal pH and documented ability of bacterial isolates to ferment rice and maltose in vitro. Specificity of the rice breath hydrogen test for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth was 91%. Positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and predictive accuracy were 75%, 63%, and 65%, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: Clinical value of the rice breath hydrogen test is limited due to its low sensitivity despite high specificity for detecting small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.

### Hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders: The North American consensus [^116WFTh7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

The consensus statements achieved for each of the five broad domains are summarized below:

- **Preparation of patients for breath testing**: We recommend that antibiotics should be avoided for four weeks prior to the breath test. A firm position statement could not be reached due to the lack of conclusive data on stopping or continuing probiotics or prebiotics prior to breath testing. We suggest that, if tolerated by the patient, promotility drugs and laxatives should be stopped at least one week prior to breath testing. Fermentable foods, such as complex carbohydrates, should be avoided on the day prior to breath testing. The fasting period prior to breath testing should be 8–12 hours. We recommend avoiding smoking and limiting physical activity on the day of breath testing. It is not necessary to stop proton pump inhibitors prior to breath testing.

With regards to preparation for breath testing, the use of antibiotics has been clearly shown to alter the H2 and CH4 composition of the exhaled breath, and although no clear data exist, a four-week gap between the cessation of antibiotic therapy and performance of the test is generally recommended. While the effect of antibiotics on hydrogen and methane production is well known, the extent of this effect based on bioavailability and pharmacodynamics of antibiotics is not well understood. This timeline between breath testing and antibiotic use may depend on the purpose for which the test is being performed.

### Hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders: The North American consensus [^113mASEr]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Breath tests (BTs) are important for the diagnosis of carbohydrate maldigestion syndromes and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). However, standardization is lacking regarding indications for testing, test methodology, and interpretation of results. A consensus meeting of experts was convened to develop guidelines for clinicians and research.

Pre-meeting survey questions encompassing five domains — indications, preparation, performance, interpretation of results, and knowledge gaps — were sent to 17 clinician-scientists, and 10 attended a live meeting. Using an evidence-based approach, 28 statements were finalized and voted on anonymously by a working group of specialists. Consensus was reached on 26 statements encompassing all five domains. Consensus doses for lactulose, glucose, fructose, and lactose BT were 10g, 75g, 25g, and 25g, respectively. Glucose and lactulose BTs remain the least invasive alternatives to diagnose SIBO. BT is useful in the diagnosis of carbohydrate maldigestion, methane-associated constipation, and evaluation of bloating/gas but not in the assessment of oro-cecal transit. A rise in hydrogen of ≥ 20 p.p.m. by 90 minutes during glucose or lactulose BT for SIBO was considered positive. Methane levels ≥ 10 p.p.m. were considered methane-positive. SIBO should be excluded prior to BT for carbohydrate malabsorption to avoid false positives. A rise in hydrogen of ≥ 20 p.p.m. from baseline during BT was considered positive for maldigestion.

Breath testing (BT) is a useful, inexpensive, simple, and safe diagnostic test in the evaluation of gastrointestinal disorders.

### Impact of oral-cecal transit time on the interpretation of lactulose breath tests after RYGB: a personalized approach to the diagnosis of SIBO [^115SDa8G]. Obesity Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Traditionally, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is diagnosed when there is an early peak in breath hydrogen or methane. Given unclear intestinal transit time in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) patients, it is unknown if the traditional approach for diagnosing SIBO is adequate in this patient population.

- **Aim**: To assess oral-cecal transit time (OCTT) and its impact on the interpretation of breath tests in the diagnosis of SIBO in patients with RYGB.

- **Methods**: This study was a retrospective review of prospectively collected data on RYGB patients who underwent testing for SIBO using lactulose breath test (LBT), with or without small bowel follow-through (SBFT), to assess OCTT. Outcomes of SIBO test based on LBT alone versus LBT with OCTT were compared using a chi-squared test.

- **Results**: Sixty-two of the 151 RYGB patients who underwent LBT also underwent an additional SBFT to assess OCTT. The median OCTT was 60 minutes. Of these, 59.7% had OCTT shorter than 90 minutes. Based on LBT alone, 36 of 62 patients (58.1%) were classified as positive for SIBO. When LBT results were combined with OCTT, 26 of 36 patients (72.2%) had hydrogen or methane rise within OCTT, suggesting a 27.8% false positive rate. Patients with true positive SIBO, based on LBT and OCTT, had a higher response rate to antibiotics compared to those with false positive SIBO (78.3% vs. 33.3%, p = 0.03).

- **Conclusion**: A personalized approach of combining LBT with SBFT to assess OCTT may improve the accuracy of SIBO testing and enhance clinical outcomes in patients with RYGB.

### Hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders: The North American consensus [^116hBVpi]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

The fructose breath test is performed to diagnose fructose maldigestion/intolerance. In fructose intolerant subjects, unabsorbed fructose is fermented by colonic bacteria, causing IBS-like symptoms. A well-conducted study has shown that ingesting 25 g of fructose is the appropriate dose for fructose breath testing and symptom correlation. Limitations of the test include false negatives, which can occur in individuals who are fixed hydrogen non-methane producers, and false positives, which can occur in individuals with SIBO. Nucera et al. showed that the number of positive fructose breath tests in IBS patients with positive lactulose tests dropped from 62% to 3% after one week of antibiotic treatment. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of breath testing in sorbitol and fructan intolerance.

IBS-like symptoms are commonly seen in patients with SIBO and carbohydrate maldigestion. However, symptom profiles of these patients are non-specific, and clinical history alone cannot differentiate the underlying cause. In an assessment of 144 subjects with IBS-like symptoms, Jacobs et al. found no difference in the intensity, frequency, and duration of abdominal pain, bloating, fullness, belching, indigestion, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and gas among patients with or without SIBO proven by aerobic/anaerobic/fungal small bowel cultures. Meta-analyses have documented a wide variety of types of breath tests (i.e. different substrates) as well as considerable variability in the performance and interpretation of these breath tests in IBS patients vs. controls. However, they found that over

### Does a glucose-based hydrogen and methane breath test detect bacterial overgrowth in the jejunum [^115TGHER]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2018). Low credibility.

Direct diagnosis of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) requires the collection and culture of fluid from the jejunal lumen, with a finding of over 10^5 viable bacteria per mL. More often, SIBO is diagnosed indirectly using a non-invasive test of the exhaled hydrogen and methane generated by microbial fermentation when ingested glucose reaches the jejunum. Our objective was to determine how well this breath test detects chronic overgrowth of jejunal bacteria that is unrelated to gastrointestinal surgery.

- **Methods**: Eighteen patients reporting symptoms consistent with SIBO received a glucose breath test. On a later day, the jejunal lumen was sampled via aspiration during enteroscopy. Jejunal aspirates were cultured on aerobic and anaerobic media. DNA was extracted from the same samples and analyzed by quantitative pan-bacterial PCR amplification of 16S ribosomal rRNA genes, which provided a culture-independent bacterial cell count.

- **Key results**: Combined bacterial colony counts ranged from 5.7 x 10^3 to 7.9 x 10^6 CFU/mL. DNA-based yields ranged from 1.5 x 10^5 to 3.1 x 10^7 bacterial genomes per mL. Microbial viability ranged from 0.3% to near 100%. We found no significant correlation of glucose breath test results with either the number of bacterial colonies or the DNA-based bacterial cell counts. Instead, higher signals in the hydrogen-methane breath test were significantly correlated with a lower viability of jejunal bacteria, at a P-value of .014.

- **Conclusions & inferences**: The glucose-based hydrogen and methane breath test is not sensitive to detecting.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, specifically in relation to breath testing, technical considerations and the NAC 2017 guidelines recommend using the following carbohydrate substrates with or followed by one cup of water for breath testing:

- **Glucose**: 75 g
- **Lactulose**: 10 g

---

### Hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders: The North American consensus [^114iWzpP]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

We suggest that the correct dose of lactulose for breath testing is 10 g with or followed by one cup of water. We suggest that the correct dose of glucose for breath testing is 75 g mixed with or followed by one cup of water. We suggest that the correct dose of lactose for breath testing is 25 g mixed with or followed by one cup of water. We suggest that the correct dose of fructose for breath testing is 25 g mixed with or followed by one cup of water. We suggest that fructose and lactose breath testing should be performed for at least 3 hours. Additionally, the presence of bacterial overgrowth should be ruled out before performing lactose or fructose breath testing. We recommend that hydrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide should all be measured simultaneously during breath testing.

When performing lactulose breath tests for the determination of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), the majority of studies have used a dose of 10 g. Higher doses incur the risk of speeding intestinal transit time, which could affect test data.

With regards to the glucose breath testing, variable doses of 50 g and 75–100 g have been used. Comparative studies using 50 g, 75 g, or 100 g have not been performed. A 75 g dose is used for oral glucose testing in diabetics, as recommended by the World Health Organization; hence, from the practical standpoint, stocking 75 g doses is less expensive, easier to obtain for breath test centers, and could provide an adequate amount of carbohydrate substrate.

In subjects with lactose and fructose intolerance, unabsorbed substrate is fermented by the colonic bacteria.

### Guidelines for the investigation of chronic diarrhoea in adults: British Society of Gastroenterology, 3rd edition [^112ZefWN]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

This illustrates a key underlying flaw of breath testing in isolation: that transit time is assumed rather than measured. The result of this assumption is that fast orocaecal transit can confound interpretation of an early hydrogen peak, a circumstance that is more likely after intestinal resection. This issue has been demonstrated in high-quality physiological and clinical studies with both lactulose and glucose.

The methodological problems and performance of hydrogen breath testing mean that it may add little when SBBO is suspected. A positive test will reinforce the clinician's prior view that the cause may be SBBO; a negative test will not exclude the diagnosis as a possibility. It is not clear that such an intermediate investigative step is necessary or of value. It would be reasonable to test for SBBO in patients with diarrhoea and a low to moderate pretest probability of SBBO. However, where the pretest probability is high — for example, in those with anatomical abnormalities such as dilation, diverticulosis, prior small bowel surgery, or pseudo-obstruction — the most practical approach would be to proceed straight to an empirical antibiotic trial.

### Hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders: The North American consensus [^11297qob]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Breath test (BT) is performed to aid in the diagnosis of many common gastroenterological conditions, including small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like symptoms, carbohydrate maldigestion, and dysfunction or alterations in oro-cecal transit. Presently, in clinical practice, BT is being performed with various substrates (e.g. glucose, lactulose, fructose, sorbitol, sucrose, and inulin) using variable doses for a range of established and unestablished indications (e.g. SIBO, orocecal-transit time assessment, and carbohydrate maldigestion). The number of BTs being ordered by healthcare professionals is rising, including the use of mail-order breath tests. However, the lack of standardization regarding the indications, preparation, performance, and interpretation of BT has led to considerable heterogeneity between different centers and practitioners. Additionally, research gaps are widening due to inter-study variability in methodology. A systematic review found 13 case-control studies that used breath testing to diagnose SIBO. Detailed examination of these studies reveals that they used 13 different methodologies to conduct the breath test or interpret the results.

BT relies on the measurement of gases produced in the intestine, which diffuse into the systemic circulation and are expired through the lungs. There are four main sources for intestinal gases: swallowed air and air mixed with food, chemical reactions in the gut, diffusion of gases from the bloodstream, and microbial metabolism. Healthy subjects have an average of about 10…

### Breath methane does not correlate with constipation severity or bloating in patients with constipation [^114DVcrc]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

The goals of this study were to evaluate whether the breath methane level on glucose breath testing (GBT) is associated with constipation severity and to compare methane levels between patients with constipation and diarrhea.

The breath methane level has been linked to constipation and its severity in previous research. However, several recent studies have raised questions about these associations.

Patients who presented consecutively at a tertiary care gastroenterology motility laboratory for GBT were included in the study. GBT was performed using a 75-g glucose load following a standard institutional protocol. Constipation and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) severity were measured using the Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms (PAC-SYM) and the IBS-symptom severity scale (IBS-SSS).

In a cohort of 79 constipated patients, there was no significant correlation between baseline or maximum methane levels and the total PAC-SYM score, IBS-SSS, or bloating severity. Baseline or maximum methane levels of ≥ 3 and 5 ppm were equally distributed among those with constipation (n = 79) and diarrhea (n = 122). Only baseline methane levels of ≥ 10 and ≥ 20 ppm significantly correlated with constipation (P < 0.001 for both).

The study concluded that constipation and bloating severity did not correlate with methane levels on GBT. Additionally, only higher baseline methane levels (≥ 10 and ≥ 20 ppm) significantly correlated with constipation, as baseline methane levels up to 5 ppm were equally common in patients with diarrhea and constipation.

### Hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders: The North American consensus [^114eYWVS]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Interpretation of breath testing results

We suggest that a rise of ≥ 20 p.p.m. from baseline in hydrogen during the test should be considered positive for fructose and lactose breath testing. Until better data are available, for clinical and research purposes, a rise of ≥ 20 p.p.m. from baseline in hydrogen by 90 minutes should be considered a positive test for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). We suggest that two peaks on a breath test are not required for the diagnosis of SIBO. Until further data are available, a level of ≥ 10 p.p.m. should be considered positive for methane on a breath test.

Similar to the European consensus statements and based on the evidence, we suggest using a cutoff value of ≥ 20 p.p.m. rise above baseline as positive for the lactose breath test. The test should be performed for at least 3 hours to ensure the presence of colonic fermentation. We suggest the same criteria for interpretation of fructose breath testing based on the results of the study by Rao et al, which showed that the rise of hydrogen always occurs within 3 hours of testing. The value of the development of symptoms during fructose breath testing is unclear and needs further evaluation.

### AGA clinical practice update on small intestinal bacterial overgrowth: Expert review [^114eRfd5]. Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Thanks to ready access to hydrogen breath testing, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is now commonly diagnosed among individuals presenting with a variety of gastrointestinal and even non-gastrointestinal symptoms. It is increasingly implicated in the lay press and media in the causation of a diverse array of disorders. Its definition, however, remains controversial, and true prevalence is accordingly undefined. The purpose of this review was to provide a historical background to the concept of SIBO, critically review concepts of SIBO (including symptomatology, pathophysiology, clinical consequences, diagnosis, and treatment), define unanswered questions, and provide a roadmap toward their resolution.

- **Methods**: Best Practice Advice statements were developed following discussion by the three authors. Two authors each developed text around certain Best Practice Advice based on a review of available literature. All three authors reviewed the complete draft and, after discussion, redrafting, and further review and revision, all authors agreed on a final draft.

- **Best practice advice 1**: The definition of SIBO as a clinical entity lacks precision and consistency; it is a term generally applied to a clinical disorder where symptoms, clinical signs, and/or laboratory abnormalities are attributed to changes in the numbers of bacteria or in the composition of the bacterial population in the small intestine.

- **Best practice advice 2**: Symptoms traditionally linked to SIBO include bloating, diarrhea, and abdominal pain/discomfort. Steatorrhea may be seen in certain cases.

### Hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders: The North American consensus [^115apy74]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Prokinetic drugs such as tegaserod and other laxatives, such as magnesium compounds, can also affect the composition of the breath gases. Faster transit time caused by promotility drugs will lead to an earlier delivery of the substrate to the colon and will increase the chance of a false positive result. No clear data exist, but a 4-week gap between cessation of prokinetics and breath testing has previously been recommended. However, a 4-week gap may not be practical in patients with constipation or gastroparesis; hence, we propose discontinuing laxatives and promotility agents for a week, only if tolerated by patients.

A low fasting level of breath H2 is essential for interpreting the breath test results, as these are directly affected by the consumption of fermentable complex carbohydrates. As a result, avoidance of complex carbohydrates and dairy products the evening or day before a breath test (meat and rice do not appear to affect the breath test) and overnight fasting are also recommended. Although the precise duration requires further determination in future studies, these dietary modifications can help improve the accuracy of the test results.

- **Smoking and physical activity**: Smoking affects breath test results by increasing exhaled H2 and CO2 content and should be avoided on the day of the test. Smoking also increases gastric transit time. As hyperventilation inversely affects H2 levels, excessive physical activity should be avoided during the breath test.

- **Use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)**: Conflicting results exist regarding the effect of PPIs on breath test results. Stopping PPIs may not necessarily lead to more accurate measurements of the exhaled breath, indicating a need for further research in this area.

### Relevance of methane and carbon dioxide evaluation in breath tests for carbohydrate malabsorption in a paediatric cohort [^1141cgKk]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2021). High credibility.

The relevance of methane measurement in breath tests for detecting carbohydrate malabsorption in children remains controversial. The necessity for correction due to poor sample collection is disputed. This study evaluated the importance of methane and CO2 measurements in diagnosing pediatric carbohydrate malabsorption.

A total of 132 breath tests, including 54 for fructose and 78 for lactose, were conducted on 91 children and adolescents experiencing functional abdominal complaints. Breath samples were analyzed for hydrogen, methane, and CO2. Malabsorption was defined by a net increase over the baseline of ≥ 20 parts per million (ppm) for hydrogen, ≥ 5 to ≥ 12 ppm for methane, and ≥ 10 to ≥ 15 ppm for hydrogen-plus-methane. Diagnoses were made both before and after applying a CO2-based correction factor, with 5.5% as the numerator. Hydrogen-based test results were compared with those obtained using other cut-off values.

Fifty-eight positive tests were identified through hydrogen measurement without CO2 correction. The inclusion of methane measurements did not significantly impact the test results (P > 0.05). Only when using extraordinary cut-offs — combined hydrogen-plus-methane less than ≥ 18 ppm — did the rate of diagnosed malabsorbers increase significantly (P < 0.05). After CO2 correction, hydrogen levels ≥ 20 ppm were detected in four additional patients, but one patient lost the hydrogen-based diagnosis of malabsorption (Cohen kappa = 0.92).

In conclusion, methane measurement did not significantly alter the detection rate of carbohydrate malabsorbers in children and adolescents with functional abdominal complaints.

### The degree of breath methane production in IBS correlates with the severity of constipation [^115LR566]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Recent work has demonstrated that among irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) subjects, methane on the lactulose breath test (LBT) is nearly universally associated with constipation predominance. This work has been based on subjective constipation outcomes. In this study, methane is compared to constipation in another population of IBS subjects, with constipation being determined both subjectively and objectively.

- **Methods**: A nested study was conducted in subjects enrolled in a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study. After consent, subjects were asked to complete a stool diary for 7 days. This included logging of all bowel movements that week as well as documenting the stool consistency for each during the same period using the Bristol Stool Score. After 7 days, subjects were asked to rate their symptoms on a visual analogue scale (VAS) score (0–100 mm) for diarrhea and constipation. They then had an LBT to evaluate both methane and hydrogen profiles over 180 minutes. Subjects with methane were compared to those without methane for Bristol Stool Score, stool frequency, as well as VAS scores for diarrhea and constipation. The degree of constipation was then compared to the quantity of methane production on LBT based on the area under the curve.

- **Results**: Among 87 subjects, 20 (23.8%) produced methane. IBS subjects with methane had a mean constipation severity of 66.1 ± 36.7 compared to 36.2 ± 30.8 for non-methane producers (P < 0.001). The opposite was noted for diarrhea (P < 0.01). On LBT, the quantity of methane seen on the breath test was directly proportional to the degree of constipation.

### Hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders: The North American consensus [^115jL6HD]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). High credibility.

Historically, a bacterial concentration of ≥ 10^5 colony-forming units (c.f.u.)/ml has been used for identifying any infection in the small bowel, including SIBO. However, this cut-off is not well-validated and has been a point of controversy. A systematic review of literature on the diagnosis of SIBO observed that healthy controls have a bacterial concentration of ≤ 10^3 c.f.u./ml, while concentrations ≥ 10^5 c.f.u. are mostly seen in patients with blind loop syndrome, such as patients with the Billroth II procedure. Currently, a bacterial concentration of > 10^3 c.f.u./ml is generally considered significant.

Glucose is a monosaccharide that is absorbed in the proximal small bowel, whereas lactulose is a non-digestible disaccharide that reaches the colon. Determining the exact test characteristics of glucose and lactulose breath testing in diagnosing SIBO is difficult to achieve due to the variability between studies in the interpretation of small bowel bacterial concentration as the gold standard test and the lack of uniformity in defining a positive breath test. In fact, such variability was one of the main motivations for the consensus document. In a systematic review, Khoshini et al. found 11 studies that have attempted to validate the accuracy of breath testing in the diagnosis of SIBO. The sensitivity of glucose breath testing varied from 20% to 93% and specificity from 30% to 86%. The sensitivity of lactulose breath testing ranged from 31% to 68%, and specificity ranged from 44% to 100%. There were striking differences in methodology in the included studies.

### Associations between postprandial symptoms, hydrogen and methane production, and transit time in irritable bowel syndrome [^113WbTCw]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). High credibility.

Abnormal oroanal transit time (OATT) and visceral hypersensitivity are key pathophysiological factors in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The lactulose nutrient challenge test (LNCT) has been developed to assess postprandial symptoms and gut microbial fermentation. This study aimed to investigate associations between OATT, rectal sensitivity, and LNCT in IBS patients.

We included 263 IBS patients from two study cohorts to explore the link between pathophysiology and symptoms. During the LNCT, severity of postprandial symptoms was graded, and breath hydrogen/methane concentrations were measured after ingestion of a combined lactulose nutrient drink every 15 minutes for 4 hours. Patients underwent investigations of rectal sensitivity (rectal barostat) and OATT (radiopaque markers). Comorbid conditions such as functional dyspepsia, anxiety, depression, and somatization were assessed with questionnaires.

- **Key results**: After controlling for comorbid conditions, rectal sensitivity was associated with abdominal pain (p < 0.05). A more rapid OATT was associated with higher severity of abdominal discomfort, rumbling, nausea, and urgency (p < 0.05 for all) both pre- and post-prandially. Postprandial nausea, urgency, and abdominal pain varied over time depending on OATT (p < 0.05 for all). OATT, but not rectal sensitivity, was associated with hydrogen and methane concentrations (p = 0.002 for both). Trajectories over time of postprandial symptoms and exhaled hydrogen/methane concentrations correlated differently depending on various factors.

### Hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders: The North American consensus [^113didhW]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Breath tests (BTs) play a crucial role in diagnosing carbohydrate maldigestion syndromes and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). However, there is a lack of standardization concerning indications for testing, test methodology, and result interpretation. A consensus meeting of experts was convened to develop guidelines for clinicians and researchers.

Methods: Pre-meeting survey questions encompassing five domains — indications, preparation, performance, interpretation of results, and knowledge gaps — were sent to 17 clinician-scientists, with 10 attending a live meeting. Using an evidence-based approach, 28 statements were finalized and anonymously voted on by a working group of specialists.

Results: Consensus was reached on 26 statements covering all five domains. Consensus doses for lactulose, glucose, fructose, and lactose BT were determined to be 10, 75, 25, and 25 g, respectively. Glucose and lactulose BTs remain the least invasive options for diagnosing SIBO. BTs are valuable in diagnosing carbohydrate maldigestion, methane-associated constipation, and evaluating bloating/gas, but are not applicable for assessing oro-cecal transit. A hydrogen rise of ≥ 20 p.p.m. by 90 minutes during glucose or lactulose BT was considered positive for SIBO, while methane levels ≥ 10 p.p.m. were considered methane-positive. It is recommended to exclude SIBO prior to BT for carbohydrate malabsorption to prevent false positives. A hydrogen rise of ≥ 20 p.p.m. from baseline during BT was deemed positive for maldigestion.

Breath testing is a useful, inexpensive, simple, and safe diagnostic tool.

### Repeatability and effect of blinding of fructose breath tests in patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders [^114EzB2A]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

Breath tests are used as measures of sugar intolerance or malabsorption in patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID), although the repeatability or anticipatory bias have not been adequately studied. We examined the repeatability and anticipatory bias during fructose breath testing using a nocebo-controlled, randomized, cross-over, and double-blind study design.

- **Methods**: Gastrointestinal symptoms and breath concentrations of hydrogen and methane were documented during breath tests with fructose (given open twice and blinded once), water (blind neutral nocebo), and a cyclamate/saccharine sweetener (blind sweet nocebo) on 5 days in patients with FGID. Repeatability of fructose breath tests (16 patients) and differences between open and blinded substrate groups (31 patients) were assessed using thresholds for intolerance and malabsorption, and areas-under-the-curve (AUC) of symptoms and breath gas concentrations.

- **Key results**: Fructose breath tests showed moderate repeatability for intolerance status (absolute agreement 87%, kappa 0.72), but limited repeatability for malabsorber status (absolute agreement 53%, kappa 0.05). Repeatability of AUCs of GI symptoms, hydrogen and methane breath concentrations was moderate (intraclass correlation coefficients 0.70, 0.57, and 0.57, respectively). There were no significant differences between open and blinded fructose breath tests in intolerance or malabsorber status, or in AUCs of GI symptoms, hydrogen and methane concentrations.

- **Conclusions & inferences**: Fructose breath tests showed moderate repeatability.

### Hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders: The North American consensus [^111QX85d]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: The consensus development process is illustrated in Figure 1. Topics for discussion, including indications for breath testing, preparation and performance of the test, and interpretation of the results, were identified based on literature reviews. A pre-meeting survey designed to further delineate knowledge gaps in breath testing was sent to consensus group members. Survey results were collated and summarized prior to the consensus meeting.

- **Selection of the physician-scientists**: Participants were selected based on certain criteria. First, attendees needed to represent individuals with active and recent research in breath testing, identified through a literature search of North Americans with active publications in this area. This included physicians from major academic motility programs. Second, clinician scientists from high-volume breath testing referral centers were to be included to ensure representation of those with extensive experience in the use and interpretation of breath tests. Third, representation from various regions of the US, as well as Mexico and Canada, was crucial. A total of 17 clinician scientists from North America met these criteria, with 10 able to attend the meeting in person. The meeting was held on 16 May 2015 in Washington, D.C.

### Guidelines for the investigation of chronic diarrhoea in adults: British Society of Gastroenterology, 3rd edition [^111BrDtj]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Breath tests have long been an attractive alternative to the culture of small bowel aspirates. However, the sensitivity and specificity of these tests are generally poor.

- **Breath testing methodology**: Hydrogen breath testing is based on the ability of some bacteria to ferment carbohydrates, producing hydrogen as an end product, which mammalian cells do not produce. Originally, it was proposed that breath testing following a carbohydrate load resulted in a double peak. This occurrence was due to metabolism by small bowel bacteria, followed by a prolonged peak owing to colonic bacteria metabolism. However, the reproducibility of this double peak pattern has been challenged. The initial peak may more likely result from fermentation by oropharyngeal flora, variation in orocaecal transit times, or carbohydrate fermentation in the caecum. Additionally, false-negative results can occur in 3–25% of individuals whose bacterial flora do not produce hydrogen. This variation may occur due to the different species of bacteria involved in small bowel colonization, as exemplified by Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococci spp. Serratia, or Pseudomonas spp., which do not produce hydrogen.

Because of these issues, it is unsurprising that several studies have demonstrated low sensitivity and specificity for hydrogen breath tests. Recently, Erdogan et al. found that glucose breath testing had less than 50% sensitivity compared to duodenal aspirate tests, regardless of the addition of methane measurement to hydrogen. Consequently, the positive and negative predictive values for breath testing were also low.

### Breath testing for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth: Should we bother [^1128i6Y7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

The hydrogen breath test is based on monitoring breath hydrogen levels following the administration of a carbohydrate, most commonly lactulose, to a patient with suspected small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. This test relies on the interaction between the administered carbohydrate and the intestinal bacteria, where the resulting fermentation produces hydrogen. A positive breath test is indicated by a rise in breath hydrogen before the expected arrival time in the highly microbial cecum. Despite renewed enthusiasm for breath testing in recent years, particularly due to associations with conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, breath testing poses numerous challenges. In this discussion, several pitfalls that complicate breath testing will be described.

### A single fasting exhaled methane level correlates with fecal methanogen load, clinical symptoms and accurately detects intestinal methanogen overgrowth [^112UcBj8]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

A 2-hour breath test is the gold standard for diagnosing intestinal methanogen overgrowth (IMO). This method can be cumbersome, especially if used repetitively to monitor treatment response. Therefore, we aimed to assess the reliability of a fasting single methane measurement (SMM) in diagnosing IMO and its utility as a biomarker to monitor treatment response in subjects with IMO.

- **Methods**: First, we calculated the test characteristics of SMM compared with lactulose and glucose breath tests in two large-scale retrospective cohorts. Second, the symptomology associated with SMM using various cutoffs was analyzed. Third, in a double-blind randomized control trial, the temporal stability of SMM levels in subjects taking placebo was analyzed. Fourth, stool Methanobrevibacter smithii loads were quantified using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and compared with SMM levels. Last, the change in SMM over time during antibiotic therapy was analyzed.

- **Results**: Using the cutoff of SMM ≥ 10 ppm, SMM had a sensitivity of 86.4% and specificity of 100% for diagnosing IMO on the glucose and lactulose breath tests and was associated with constipation (5.65 ± 3.47 vs. 4.32 ± 3.62, P = 0.008). SMM remained stable for 14 weeks without treatment (P = 0.45), and antibiotics led to a decrease in SMM after 2 days (P < 0.0001). SMM was positively associated with stool M. smithii load (R = 0.65, P < 0.0001).

- **Discussion**: Fasting SMM ≥ 10 ppm seems to accurately diagnose IMO, is associated with constipation, and correlates with stool M. smithii. SMM seems to be stable without treatment.

### Hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders: The North American consensus [^113pHv8r]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Erdogan et al. assessed the optimal cut-off of glucose breath testing (75 g glucose) for detection of SIBO and correlated this with duodenal aspirates and culture (both at ≥ 10^3 and ≥ 10^5 c.f.u./ml) in 150 patients. Sensitivity of the breath test was lower at a 20 p.p.m. versus 12 p.p.m. rise of H2, at both ≥ 10^3 (32% vs. 42%) and ≥ 10^5 c.f.u./ml (48% vs. 64%) culture growth levels. Specificity was higher at both ≥ 10^3 (90% vs. 81%) and ≥ 10^5 c.f.u./ml (86% vs. 78%) culture growth.

George et al. compared the utility of a hydrogen rise of 20 p.p.m. above baseline by 90 min after ingestion of lactulose versus dual hydrogen peaks (first peak of 10 p.p.m. above baseline before the second peak of 20 p.p.m.) in 740 patients with gastroparesis. Only the hydrogen rise of 20 p.p.m. above baseline was correlated with the severity of bloating, postprandial fullness, and early satiety.

Recently, assessment of over 15,000 lactulose breath tests shows that median and mean gas production levels do not elicit a double peak. We suggest using a rise of ≥ 20 p.p.m. from baseline in hydrogen to diagnose SIBO. On the basis of evidence, a double peak should not be used to diagnose SIBO and has no validity.

### Comparative analysis of hydrogen breath test devices for the diagnosis of carbohydrate malabsorption: Fructose tests lack reliability [^116WM3JK]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Low credibility.

Hydrogen breath tests are commonly used to diagnose lactose and fructose malabsorption. While lactose breath tests are reliable, the utility of fructose tests is debated due to inconsistent results. This study aimed to compare the performance of two hydrogen breath test devices — handheld and stationary — in diagnosing lactose and fructose malabsorption in pediatric patients.

- **Methods**: Seventy-eight lactose and 53 fructose breath tests were performed in children (mean age: 11.4 ± 3.1 years) using both a handheld electrochemical detector and a stationary gas chromatograph. Malabsorption was defined as a rise in hydrogen ≥ 20 ppm over baseline. Device performance was compared using Pearson correlation, McNemar's test, and Bland-Altman analysis.

- **Results**: For lactose, 28 (35.9%) tested positive with the handheld device and 31 (39.7%) with the stationary device, showing 93.6% agreement (P = 0.38). For fructose, 16 (30.2%) tested positive with the handheld device and 26 (49.1%) with the stationary device, with only 81.1% agreement (P = 0.002). McNemar's test for marginal homogeneity suggested equivalence of the two instruments for the lactose breath tests (P = 0.38), but there was strong evidence of inequality between the two instruments for the fructose breath tests (P = 0.002). Bland-Altman analysis showed a bias toward higher hydrogen levels with the stationary device, especially in fructose tests.

- **Conclusion**: Lactose breath tests were reliable across both devices, but significant discrepancies in fructose testing, particularly higher hydrogen levels with the stationary device, were observed.

### Associations between postprandial symptoms, hydrogen and methane production, and transit time in irritable bowel syndrome [^113pBjn9]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). Low credibility.

A previous study from our group found that oroanal transit time (OATT) and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms were poorly correlated in a large irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) population. Our findings seem to contradict this, as associations were observed between several GI symptoms and OATT. However, there are major differences between the two studies regarding symptom reports. In the previous study, solely three symptoms were investigated daily for 7 days, whereas in this study, eight symptoms were assessed at regular time intervals. Furthermore, we assessed symptoms following a provocative test meal including a non-absorbable carbohydrate, where it can be expected that symptoms are induced in IBS.

Several GI symptoms were associated with OATT, as well as different postprandial symptom responses over time depending on OATT. These associations indicate that different underlying mechanisms might be involved in symptom generation in IBS patients with different transit times. Our results indicate that GI motility could play a central role in the generation of GI symptoms, and that treatments targeting transit time could improve pre- and postprandial symptoms.

Recent studies have highlighted the importance of the gut microbiota in IBS, and they produce intestinal gases through carbohydrate fermentation, which are proposed to be involved in symptom generation. Studies in IBS populations have found that methane production was associated with hard stools, slower transit, and constipation in general. Our results are in line with this, as we showed that patients with slower OATT have higher concentrations of methane than patients with more rapid OATT.

### Methanogens and hydrogen sulfide producing bacteria guide distinct gut microbe profiles and irritable bowel syndrome subtypes [^113m1pJH]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

The pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is poorly understood; however, the gut microbiome appears to play a central role. Breath testing is significant because neither hydrogen (H₂) nor methane (CH₄) is produced by human cells. Therefore, increased levels of these gases on the breath indicate increased gut colonization with fermenting bacteria and methanogens, respectively. The gases are absorbed into the bloodstream and excreted on exhaled breath. An early breath testing study suggested the importance of gut microbes in IBS, and three pivotal trials led to the US Food and Drug Administration approval of an antibiotic treatment for IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D). Moreover, a higher proportion of patients with IBS-D are H₂ positive compared with controls, and patients with a positive baseline H₂ breath test are more likely to respond to rifaximin. These data suggest that H₂ small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is part of the microbiome story in IBS-D. However, H₂ levels do not directly correlate with diarrhea, implying that other microbes beyond H₂ producers may also play a role in IBS-D.

Methane (CH₄) on breath testing, now categorized as intestinal methanogen overgrowth (IMO) rather than SIBO, was linked to IBS with constipation (IBS-C) as early as 2001. CH₄ is produced by methanogenic Archaea, predominantly Methanobrevibacter smithii, Methanosphaera stadtmanae, and Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis, and appears to slow intestinal transit by augmenting segmental smooth muscle contractile activity in the intestinal wall. A more recent study suggested that CH₄ acts through effects on enteric neurons rather than directly on muscles, proposing that CH₄ should also be considered a gasotransmitter.

### Contributions of the microbial hydrogen economy to colonic homeostasis [^114mEdTf]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Colonic gases are among the most tangible features of digestion, yet physicians are typically unable to offer long-term relief from clinical complaints of excessive gas. Studies characterizing colonic gases have linked changes in volume or composition with bowel disorders and shown that hydrogen gas (H(2)), methane, hydrogen sulphide, and carbon dioxide are by-products of the interplay between H(2)-producing fermentative bacteria and H(2) consumers, such as reductive acetogens, methanogenic archaea, and sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB).

Clinically, H(2) and methane measured in breath can indicate lactose and glucose intolerance, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and IBS. Methane levels are increased in patients with constipation or IBS. Hydrogen sulphide is a by-product of H(2) metabolism by SRB, which are ubiquitous in the colonic mucosa. Although higher hydrogen sulphide and SRB levels have been detected in patients with IBD, and to a lesser extent in colorectal cancer, this colonic gas might have beneficial effects. Moreover, H(2) has been shown to have antioxidant properties, and in the healthy colon, physiological H(2) concentrations might protect the mucosa from oxidative insults, whereas an impaired H(2) economy might facilitate inflammation or carcinogenesis.

Therefore, standardized breath gas measurements combined with ever-improving molecular methodologies could provide novel strategies to prevent, diagnose, or manage numerous colonic disorders.

### Hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders: The North American consensus [^116LCLPw]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

In the presence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), fructose and lactose are prematurely exposed to excessive small intestinal bacterial composition, leading to early fermentation and an elevation of exhaled gases. Therefore, performing a lactulose or glucose breath test to rule out SIBO should be considered prior to carbohydrate malabsorption breath testing to minimize false positive results.

All breath testing should incorporate the measurement of CO₂ (or O₂) to adjust the breath sample for non-alveolar dilution of exhaled air. Concomitant measurement of CH₄ is also required. The majority of the methanogenic archaea in the human gut (including M. smithii) utilize H₂ in the generation of CH₄, potentially impacting H₂ measurements. Hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the gut (including M. smithii) use 4 mol of H₂ and 1 mol of CO₂ to produce each mol of CH₄. It has been suggested that by scavenging H₂ produced by neighboring microbes in this manner (the "sink effect"), M. smithii and other hydrogen-utilizing methanogens allow increased polysaccharide fermentation by neighboring microbes. The detection rate of an early rise in H₂ production significantly decreases in excess methane producers. Given the importance of methane in association with gastrointestinal symptoms and the interaction of methane with hydrogen production, measurement of methane should be integrated into all breath tests. However, it should be noted that measurement of CH₄ could increase the cost of breath testing, as portable gas chromatographs do not measure CH₄.

### Hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders: The North American Consensus [^116nv63o]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, more specifically with respect to breath testing, technical considerations, NAC 2017 guidelines recommend measuring hydrogen, methane, and CO2 simultaneously during breath testing.
