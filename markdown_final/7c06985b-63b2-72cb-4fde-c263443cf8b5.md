## Question

What are the treatment options for gonococcal urethritis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment options for gonococcal urethritis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical entity and diagnostic confirmation. Then, I should verify first-line therapy and dosing nuances, including weight-based adjustments. Next, I will consider coinfection management and why dual therapy has evolved. After that, I need to check alternative regimens for cephalosporin allergy or unavailability. Then, I should review special populations and pharyngeal disease. Finally, I will examine follow-up, test-of-cure indications, partner management, and stewardship principles, and close with a concise synthesis of options with caveats about resistance and evidence quality.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and diagnostic approach. Gonococcal urethritis is a sexually transmitted infection of the urethra caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, typically presenting with mucopurulent discharge and dysuria, though asymptomatic cases occur, and diagnosis relies on nucleic acid amplification testing from first-void urine or urethral swabs, with Gram stain showing intracellular diplococci as supportive but not definitive evidence [^112Ch7eC] [^112bqwoy]. Hold on, I should verify when to treat presumptively: in men with objective urethritis or high-risk exposure when follow-up is uncertain, treatment should be initiated after specimen collection, whereas in low-risk, mildly symptomatic patients, delaying therapy until NAAT results is reasonable to avoid overtreatment and resistance pressure [^117Gfegm] [^111Xd9P3].

> Now, I will examine first-line therapy. Current CDC guidance recommends ceftriaxone 500 mg intramuscularly as a single dose for persons weighing less than 150 kg, and 1 g intramuscularly for those weighing 150 kg or more, reflecting pharmacokinetic considerations to ensure sustained bactericidal levels across body sizes [^114sAwRH] [^111hyrww]. Wait, let me verify the rationale for monotherapy rather than dual therapy: dual therapy with azithromycin was previously standard to mitigate resistance, but rising azithromycin resistance and stewardship concerns led to ceftriaxone monotherapy as the preferred regimen in 2021, with doxycycline added only if chlamydial coinfection is not excluded [^111mei5R] [^115foTNr]. I should confirm that this applies to urogenital, rectal, and pharyngeal sites; yes, the 500 mg ceftriaxone regimen is recommended for all uncomplicated anatomic sites, with the weight-based adjustment for heavier patients [^111hyrww].

> Next, I should review coinfection management. Because chlamydial coinfection is common and often silent, if chlamydia has not been excluded, add doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days; azithromycin 1 g as a single dose is an alternative when doxycycline is contraindicated, though doxycycline is preferred given lower resistance and broader coverage in this context [^112spNFF] [^111hyrww]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with WHO and European guidance; yes, both emphasize pathogen-directed therapy and adding chlamydia coverage when coinfection is possible, reinforcing the CDC approach [^111KFEn2] [^113CnwXU].

> I will now examine alternatives when ceftriaxone is unavailable or contraindicated. Two evidence-supported options are gentamicin 240 mg intramuscularly plus azithromycin 2 g orally as single doses, or cefixime 800 mg orally as a single dose; both require a test of cure if used, given lower and less sustained bactericidal activity compared with ceftriaxone [^1176Behv] [^111hyrww]. Wait, let me verify the test-of-cure requirement; yes, CDC advises test-of-cure 7–14 days after alternative regimens, whereas it is not routinely required after ceftriaxone monotherapy for urogenital or rectal disease [^notfound]. I should also note that cefixime is less reliable for pharyngeal infection, which is why test-of-cure is emphasized when the pharynx is involved or when alternative agents are used [^111hyrww].

> For patients with severe beta-lactam allergy, I need to ensure safe alternatives. Spectinomycin 2 g intramuscularly plus azithromycin 2 g orally as single doses is a reasonable option, though spectinomycin is not available in many settings and is ineffective for pharyngeal disease, so I should confirm local access and counsel accordingly [^111rXPN7] [^115YAXjr]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with WHO; yes, WHO 2024 includes spectinomycin plus azithromycin as an alternative when cephalosporins cannot be used, with the caveat of poor pharyngeal efficacy and the need for test-of-cure if used [^115YAXjr].

> Let me consider special populations and pharyngeal disease. Pharyngeal gonorrhea is more difficult to eradicate and serves as a reservoir for resistance; therefore, a test-of-cure using culture or NAAT 7–14 days after treatment is recommended, and if NAAT is positive, confirmatory culture with susceptibility testing should be pursued before retreatment [^111JhmdE] [^113F25zJ]. I should double-check that this applies regardless of the regimen used for pharynx; yes, test-of-cure is advised for all pharyngeal cases, including those treated with ceftriaxone, due to lower eradication rates at this site [^111JhmdE]. For pregnancy, the same ceftriaxone regimen is used, with azithromycin 1 g orally as preferred chlamydia therapy if coinfection is present, avoiding doxycycline in the first trimester when possible [^111hyrww].

> Next, I should review follow-up and retesting. Routine test-of-cure is not required for uncomplicated urogenital or rectal gonorrhea treated with recommended regimens, but patients should be retested at 3 months because reinfection is common, and if 3-month retesting is not feasible, retest within 12 months [^111JhmdE] [^113F25zJ]. Wait, let me verify the reinfection risk figures; CDC cites 7–12% reinfection within 12 months, supporting the 3-month retesting interval as best practice [^111JhmdE]. I need to ensure partner management is addressed: partners within 60 days should be notified, tested, and presumptively treated, and patients should abstain from sex for 7 days after treatment and until partners complete therapy and symptoms resolve [^116eF5pu] [^113F25zJ].

> I should confirm what to do in suspected treatment failure. Persistent symptoms or a positive test after appropriate therapy should prompt evaluation for reinfection, nonadherence, or resistance; obtain culture with susceptibilities when possible and consult infectious disease or public health for guidance, especially if alternative regimens were used or if there is pharyngeal involvement [^117PCqsZ] [^113CJXoo]. Hold on, I should verify retreatment options; WHO 2024 suggests using a regimen not previously used, such as ceftriaxone 1 g IM plus azithromycin 2 g PO if ceftriaxone was not used before, or gentamicin 240 mg IM plus azithromycin 2 g PO, or spectinomycin 2 g IM plus azithromycin 2 g PO, ideally guided by susceptibility data and local resistance patterns [^114risdp] [^114DGUcS].

> Finally, I need to ensure antimicrobial stewardship and public health principles are explicit. Treatment should be pathogen-directed when results are available, dual therapy reserved for specific indications such as unknown chlamydia status or alternative regimens, and local resistance surveillance should inform empiric choices; patients should be counseled on adherence, abstinence, and partner management to limit reinfection and resistance spread [^111KFEn2] [^112Ch7eC]. Let me reconsider the overall synthesis: first-line is ceftriaxone 500 mg IM once, with 1 g for those 150 kg or more; add doxycycline 100 mg PO BID for 7 days if chlamydia is not excluded; if ceftriaxone cannot be used, gentamicin 240 mg IM plus azithromycin 2 g PO once, or cefixime 800 mg PO once with test-of-cure; for severe beta-lactam allergy, spectinomycin 2 g IM plus azithromycin 2 g PO once; ensure pharyngeal test-of-cure when applicable and retest at 3 months to detect reinfection [^114sAwRH] [^111hyrww] [^1176Behv] [^111rXPN7] [^111JhmdE].

---

Gonococcal urethritis is treated with **ceftriaxone 500 mg IM once** [^114sAwRH] (1 g if ≥ 150 kg) [^111hyrww] as first-line therapy. If chlamydia is not excluded, add **doxycycline 100 mg PO BID for 7 days** [^112spNFF]. If ceftriaxone is unavailable or contraindicated, use **cefixime 800 mg PO once** [^1176Behv] or **gentamicin 240 mg IM plus azithromycin 2 g PO once** [^115YAXjr] [^1176Behv]. Test of cure is not needed for uncomplicated urogenital infection [^111JhmdE], but is required for pharyngeal disease [^111JhmdE]; retest at 3 months due to high reinfection risk [^113F25zJ]. Ensure **partner treatment** [^116eF5pu] and **sexual abstinence for 7 days** [^113F25zJ] after treatment and until partners are treated.

---

## First-line treatment

Ceftriaxone is the **first-line agent** [^114sAwRH] because of sustained high efficacy and low resistance [^115foTNr]. The **recommended dose** is 500 mg IM once [^114sAwRH], increased to 1 g IM once if body weight is ≥ 150 kg (300 lbs) [^111hyrww].

---

## Management of chlamydial coinfection

Because coinfection is common, **add doxycycline** 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days [^112spNFF] if chlamydia has not been excluded [^111hyrww].

---

## Alternative regimens

Use these when ceftriaxone is unavailable or contraindicated:

| **Regimen** | **Dose** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Cefixime | 800 mg PO once | - Less effective than ceftriaxone [^111hyrww] <br/> - Use only if ceftriaxone is unavailable [^114BAVPo] |
| Gentamicin + azithromycin | - Gentamicin 240 mg IM once <br/> - Azithromycin 2 g PO once | - Option for cephalosporin allergy [^115YAXjr] <br/> - Gastrointestinal side effects common [^111hyrww] |

---

## Special considerations

- **Pharyngeal infection**: More difficult to eradicate; test of cure is recommended 7–14 days after treatment [^111JhmdE] [^117LNFtn].
- **Pregnancy**: Use the same ceftriaxone regimen; treat chlamydia with azithromycin 1 g PO once if present [^111hyrww].

---

## Follow-up and test of cure

Routine test of cure is **not required** for uncomplicated urogenital infection [^111JhmdE] but is recommended for pharyngeal infection [^111JhmdE]. Retesting at **3 months** is advised due to high reinfection rates [^113F25zJ]; if not possible, retest within 12 months [^113F25zJ].

---

## Partner management

Partners within 60 days should be **notified, tested, and presumptively treated** [^116eF5pu]. Patients and partners should **abstain from sex for 7 days** [^113F25zJ] after treatment and until all partners are treated.

---

## Prevention of complications

Untreated gonococcal urethritis can lead to **epididymitis, infertility, and increased HIV risk** [^112Mnqxf]. Prompt, appropriate therapy and partner management prevent these outcomes [^112Ch7eC].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First-line**: Ceftriaxone 500 mg IM once (1 g if ≥ 150 kg) [^114sAwRH] [^111hyrww].
- **Coinfection**: Add doxycycline 100 mg PO BID for 7 days if chlamydia not excluded [^112spNFF].
- **Alternatives**: Cefixime 800 mg PO once [^114BAVPo] or gentamicin 240 mg IM + azithromycin 2 g PO once [^115YAXjr] [^1176Behv].
- **Follow-up**: No routine test of cure for urogenital infection [^111JhmdE]; retest at 3 months [^113F25zJ].
- **Partners**: Treat within 60 days; abstain from sex for 7 days after treatment and until partners are treated [^116eF5pu] [^113F25zJ].

---

Ceftriaxone remains the **cornerstone of therapy** [^114sAwRH]; manage coinfection, use alternatives when needed, and ensure partner treatment and retesting to limit reinfection and resistance [^111mei5R].

### Update on the management of gonorrhea in adults in the United States [^117UoagT]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Gonorrhea, the second most commonly reported notifiable disease, is an important cause of cervicitis, urethritis, and pelvic inflammatory disease. The selection of appropriate therapy for gonorrhea (i.e., safe, highly effective, single dose, and affordable) is complicated by the ability of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to develop resistance to antimicrobial therapies. This article reviews the key questions and data that informed the 2006 gonorrhea treatment recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Key areas addressed include the criteria used to select effective treatment for gonorrhea, the level of antimicrobial resistance at which changing treatment regimens is recommended, the epidemiology of resistance, and the use of quinolones, cephalosporins, and other classes of antimicrobials for the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea.

### Current and future treatment options for gonorrhoea [^111dbGYQ]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2013). Low credibility.

The delivery of effective antimicrobial therapy is essential for public health control of gonorrhoea, in the absence of a suitable vaccine. The antimicrobial agent chosen should have high efficacy and quality, lack toxicity and give > 95% success when given empirically. Guidelines, which are informed by surveillance data, are used to aid clinicians in their choice of appropriate agent. Historically, gonorrhoea treatment has been delivered as a single, directly observed dose but this has resulted in failure of successive antimicrobial agents which have been replaced by a new antimicrobial to which resistance has been rare or non-existing. Following the drift towards decreased susceptibility and treatment failure to the extended spectrum cephalosporins, and the lack of 'new' alternative antimicrobials, the threat of difficult to treat or untreatable gonorrhoea has emerged. The challenge of maintaining gonorrhoea as a treatable infection has resulted in national, regional and global response or action plans. This review discusses different approaches to the future treatment of gonorrhoea including; use of ceftriaxone, the injectable cephalosporin at increased dosage; dual antimicrobial therapy; use of drugs developed for other infections and use of older agents, directed by rapid point of care tests, to susceptible infections. Finally, it is considered whether the time is right to readdress the possibility of developing an effective gonococcal vaccine, given the major advances in our understanding of natural infection, molecular pathogenesis and the revolution in molecular biology techniques.

### Gonorrhoea [^112Ch7eC]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2019). High credibility.

The bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae causes the sexually transmitted infection (STI) gonorrhoea, which has an estimated global annual incidence of 86.9 million adults. Gonorrhoea can present as urethritis in men, cervicitis or urethritis in women, and in extragenital sites (pharynx, rectum, conjunctiva and, rarely, systemically) in both sexes. Confirmation of diagnosis requires microscopy of Gram-stained samples, bacterial culture or nucleic acid amplification tests. As no gonococcal vaccine is available, prevention relies on promoting safe sexual behaviours and reducing STI-associated stigma, which hinders timely diagnosis and treatment thereby increasing transmission. Single-dose systemic therapy (usually injectable ceftriaxone plus oral azithromycin) is the recommended first-line treatment. However, a major public health concern globally is that N. gonorrhoeae is evolving high levels of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which threatens the effectiveness of the available gonorrhoea treatments. Improved global surveillance of the emergence, evolution, fitness, and geographical and temporal spread of AMR in N. gonorrhoeae, and improved understanding of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics for current and future antimicrobials in the treatment of urogenital and extragenital gonorrhoea, are essential to inform treatment guidelines. Key priorities for gonorrhoea control include strengthening prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment of patients and their partners; decreasing stigma; expanding surveillance of AMR and treatment failures; and promoting responsible antimicrobial use and stewardship. To achieve these goals, the development of rapid and affordable point-of-care diagnostic tests that can simultaneously detect AMR, novel therapeutic antimicrobials and gonococcal vaccine(s) in particular is crucial.

Introduction

In the UK, diagnosis rates for gonorrhoea in 2008 were 152/100,000 for men aged 20 to 24 years and 135/100,000 for women aged 16 to 19 years. Resistance to one or more antimicrobial agent is reported in more than one quarter of isolates. Co-infection with Chlamydia trachomatis is reported in 10% to 40% of people with gonorrhoea in the US and UK.

### Update to CDC's treatment guidelines for gonococcal infection, 2020 [^117Q6o29]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

During 2018, CDC staff members and subject matter experts identified essential questions regarding gonorrhea treatment to update the 2015 STD Treatment Guidelines. A literature search of PubMed, Embase, and Medline databases conducted for January 2013–May 2019 using the parameters (gonorrhea[MeSH]) OR (gonococcal[all fields] OR gonorrhea[all fields] OR " Neisseria gonorrhoeae "[all fields]) AND (treatment[MeSH] OR antibiotic[MeSH] OR therapy) generated > 2,200 abstracts. Titles and abstracts were assessed, and 248 clinically relevant articles were reviewed. Abstracts from STD conferences held during 2015–2018 and on the National Institutes of Health clinical trials website were also reviewed.

GISP susceptibility data from January 2013 to May 2019 were reviewed. GISP monitors gonorrhea antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in the United States through monthly testing of urethral isolates from 25 symptomatic men in each of 25–30 STD specialty care clinics. Regional laboratories conduct antimicrobial susceptibility testing by agar dilution to determine MICs for selected antimicrobials. Although the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) has not established N. gonorrhoeae resistance breakpoints for ceftriaxone, cefixime, or azithromycin, CLSI categorizes isolates with MICs of ≤ 0.25 μ g/mL as susceptible for ceftriaxone and cefixime, and those with MICs of ≤ 1.00 μ g/mL as susceptible for azithromycin. To identify isolates with elevated MICs, GISP uses the following "alert values" to identify potential emerging resistance: MIC ≥ 0.125 μ g/mL for ceftriaxone, ≥ 0.25 μ g/mL for cefixime, and ≥ 2 μ g/mL for azithromycin.

In 2019, during an in-person meeting of governmental and nongovernmental participants, CDC staff members and subject matter experts reviewed data and presented their individual expert opinions. Each essential question was discussed, and applicable published articles were reviewed for their strengths, weaknesses, and relevance. Individual participants evaluated the quality of evidence, provided their input, and discussed findings in the context of the modified rating system used by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. † CDC staff members independently reviewed tables of evidence, § individual comments from the participants and professional organizations, and existing guidelines from other organizations to determine if revisions to the 2015 CDC STD Treatment Guidelines were warranted.

### Gonorrhoea [^1116ZkXT]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2014). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 2012, the diagnosis rates for gonorrhoea among adults aged 20 to 24 years in the UK were 249 per 100,000 for men and 140 per 100,000 for women. Resistance to one or more antimicrobial agent is reported in more than one quarter of isolates. Co-infection with Chlamydia trachomatis is reported in 10% to 40% of people with gonorrhoea in the US and UK.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for uncomplicated infections in men and non-pregnant women, and in pregnant women? What are the effects of treatments for disseminated gonococcal infection? What are the effects of dual treatment for gonorrhoea and chlamydia infection? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 7 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotic regimens (dual treatment, multiple dose, single dose).

### Update to CDC's treatment guidelines for gonococcal infection, 2020 [^111JhmdE]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

A test-of-cure is unnecessary for persons with uncomplicated urogenital or rectal gonorrhea who are treated with any of the recommended or alternative regimens; however, for persons with pharyngeal gonorrhea, a test-of-cure is recommended, using culture or nucleic acid amplification tests 7–14 days after initial treatment, regardless of the treatment regimen. Because reinfection within 12 months ranges from 7% to 12% among persons previously treated for gonorrhea, persons who have been treated for gonorrhea should be retested 3 months after treatment regardless of whether they believe their sex partners were treated. If retesting at 3 months is not possible, clinicians should retest within 12 months after initial treatment.

Neisseria gonorrhoeae has developed resistance to all previous first-line antimicrobial therapies over the past 75 years. Today the cephalosporins, the last available antibiotic class that is sufficiently effective, are also threatened by evolving resistance. Screening for asymptomatic gonorrhea in women and men who have sex with men, treating with a dual antibiotic regimen, ensuring effective partner therapy, and remaining vigilant for treatment failures constitute critical activities for clinicians in responding to evolving antimicrobial resistance. This article reviews the epidemiology, history of antimicrobial resistance, current screening and treatment guidelines, and future treatment options for gonorrhea.

### Urethritis: rapid evidence review [^112bqwoy]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Urethritis refers to inflammation of the urethra and is classified as gonococcal (caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae) or nongonococcal in origin (most commonly caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma genitalium, or Trichomonas vaginalis). The most common signs and symptoms include dysuria, mucopurulent urethral discharge, urethral discomfort, and erythema. Diagnostic criteria include typical signs, symptoms, or history of exposure in addition to mucopurulent discharge, Gram stain of urethral secretions showing at least two white blood cells per oil immersion field, first-void urinalysis showing at least 10 white blood cells per high-power field, or a positive leukocyte esterase result with first-void urine. First-line empiric treatment consists of ceftriaxone and doxycycline; however, the antibiotic regimen may be targeted to the isolated organism. Repeat testing is not recommended less than three weeks after treatment because false-positive results are possible during this time. Patients treated for a sexually transmitted infection should have repeat screening in three months, with shared decision-making about future screening intervals. Patients treated for urethritis should abstain from sex for seven days after the start of treatment, until their partners have been adequately treated, and until their symptoms have fully resolved.

### Management of gonorrhea in adolescents and adults in the United States [^115iyar3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Gonorrhea is the second most commonly reported notifiable disease in the United States and is associated with serious health sequelae, including pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy. Treatment for gonorrhea has been complicated by antimicrobial resistance. Neisseria gonorrhoeae has developed resistance to each of the antimicrobials that were previously recommended as first-line treatment regimens, and current treatment options are severely limited. This article summarizes the key questions and data that were discussed at the Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) Treatment Guidelines Expert Consultation meeting in April 2013, and the rationale for the 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention STD treatment guidelines for gonococcal infections in adolescents and adults. Key issues addressed include whether to change the dosage of ceftriaxone and azithromycin used in the recommended dual treatment regimen, whether to continue to list dual treatment with cefixime and azithromycin as an alternative treatment regimen, and management of gonococcal infections in persons with severe cephalosporin allergy or suspected treatment failure.

### Advances in the understanding and treatment of male urethritis [^116fZK4v]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis are well-documented urethral pathogens, and the literature supporting Mycoplasma genitalium as an etiology of urethritis is growing. Trichomonas vaginalis and viral pathogens (herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 and adenovirus) can cause urethritis, particularly in specific subpopulations. New data are emerging regarding the potential role of bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria in urethritis, although results are inconsistent regarding the pathogenic role of Ureaplasma urealyticum in men. Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma parvum do not appear to be pathogens. Men with suspected urethritis should undergo evaluation to confirm urethral inflammation and etiologic cause. Although nucleic acid amplification testing would detect N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis (or T. vaginalis if utilized), there is no US Food and Drug Administration-approved clinical test for M. genitalium available in the United States at this time. The varied etiologies of urethritis and lack of diagnostic options for some organisms present treatment challenges in the clinical setting.

Trichomoniasis and BV should be treated if detected. For women at lower risk for STIs, deferring treatment until results of diagnostic tests are available is an option; if treatment is deferred and C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae NAATs are negative, a follow-up visit to determine whether the cervicitis has resolved can be considered. Recommended regimen: doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days; alternative regimen: azithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose.

### Urethritis and cervicitis-STI treatment guidelines… [^112Qrdio]. CDC (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatment Ideally, treatment should be pathogen based; however, diagnostic information might not be immediately available. Presumptive treatment should be initiated at NGU diagnosis. Doxycycline is highly effective for chlamydial urethral infections and is also effective for chlamydial infections of the rectum; it also has some activity against. Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days Azithromycin 1 g, orally in a single dose OR Azithromycin 500 mg orally in a single dose; then 250 mg orally daily for 4 days. To maximize compliance with recommended therapies, medications should be dispensed on-site at the clinic, and, regardless of the number of doses involved in the regimen, the first dose should be directly observed. Erythromycin is no longer recommended for NGU because of its gastrointestinal side effects and dosing frequency. Levofloxacin is no longer recommended for NGU because of its inferior efficacy, especially for M. genitalium. If M.

genitalium resistance testing is available it should be performed, and the results should be used to guide therapy. If M. genitalium resistance testing is not available, doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days followed by moxifloxacin 400 mg orally once daily for 7 days should be used. The rationale for this approach is that although not curative, doxycycline decreases the M. genitalium bacterial load, thereby increasing likelihood of moxifloxacin success. Higher doses of azithromycin have not been effective for M. genitalium after azithromycin treatment failures. Men with persistent or recurrent NGU after treatment for M. genitalium or T. vaginalis should be referred to an infectious disease or urology specialist.

### Management of Neisseria gonorrhoeae in the United States: summary of evidence from the development of the 2020 gonorrhea treatment recommendations and the 2021 centers for disease control and prevention sexually transmitted infection treatment guidelines [^115foTNr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neisseria gonorrhoeae has developed resistance to all first-line recommended therapies, making gonococcal antimicrobial resistance a major public health concern given limited antibiotic options currently and an even smaller antimicrobial development pipeline. Since the release of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2015 STD Treatment Guidelines, azithromycin, part of the 2015 dual-drug treatment regimen, has had a rapid rise in resistance. The 2020 CDC Gonorrhea Treatment Recommendations and the 2021 Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) Treatment Guidelines were developed weighing the priorities of treating the individual, protecting the population, and preventing antimicrobial resistance.

Methods

Gonorrhea subject matter experts (SME) generated 8 key questions and conducted a literature review of updated data from 2013 to 2019 on gonorrhea antimicrobial resistance, treatment failures, clinical trials, and other key topics. More than 2200 abstracts were assessed, and 248 clinically relevant articles were thoroughly reviewed. SMEs also evaluated N gonorrhoeae antimicrobial resistance data from the Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP).

Evidence

Although there have been reports of ceftriaxone treatment failures internationally, GISP data suggest that ceftriaxone minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) have remained stable in the United States, with < 0.1% exhibiting an "alert value" MIC (> 0.25 mcg/mL). However, GISP documented a rapid rise in the proportion of isolates with an elevated MIC (≥ 2.0 mcg/mL) to azithromycin-nearly 5% in 2018. At the same time, new pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data are available, and there is greater recognition of the need for antimicrobial stewardship.

Summary

The 2021 CDC STI Treatment Guidelines now recommend 500mg ceftriaxone intramuscularly once for the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea at all anatomic sites. If coinfection with chlamydia has not been excluded, cotreatment with doxycycline 100mg twice daily for 7 days should be added. Few alternative therapies exist for persons with cephalosporin allergies; there are no recommended alternative therapies for N gonorrhoeae infection of the throat.

Gonococcal Infections

Gonococcal Infection Among Adolescents and Adults

In the United States, an estimated 1,568,000 new N. gonorrhoeae infections occur each year, and gonorrhea is the second most commonly reported bacterial communicable disease. Urethral infections caused by N. gonorrhoeae can produce symptoms among men that cause them to seek curative treatment soon enough to prevent sequelae, but often not soon enough to prevent transmission to others. Among women, gonococcal infections are commonly asymptomatic or might not produce recognizable symptoms until complications (e.g. PID) have occurred. PID can result in tubal scarring that can lead to infertility or ectopic pregnancy.

Annual screening for N. gonorrhoeae infection is recommended for all sexually active women aged < 25 years and for older women at increased risk for infection (e.g. those aged ≥ 25 years who have a new sex partner, more than one sex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, or a sex partner who has an STI). Additional risk factors for gonorrhea include inconsistent condom use among persons who are not in mutually monogamous relationships, previous or coexisting STIs, and exchanging sex for money or drugs. Clinicians should consider the communities they serve and consult local public health authorities for guidance regarding identifying groups at increased risk. Gonococcal infection, in particular, is concentrated in specific geographic locations and communities. MSM at high risk for gonococcal infection (e.g. those with multiple anonymous partners or substance abuse) or those at risk for HIV acquisition should be screened at all anatomic sites of exposure every 3–6 months (see Men Who Have Sex with Men). At least annual screening is recommended for all MSM. Screening for gonorrhea among heterosexual men and women aged > 25 years who are at low risk for infection is not recommended. A recent travel history with sexual contacts outside the United States should be part of any gonorrhea evaluation.

Other Management Considerations

To maximize adherence with recommended therapies and reduce complications and transmission, medication for gonococcal infection should be provided on-site and directly observed. If medications are unavailable when treatment is indicated, linkage to an STI treatment facility should be provided for same-day treatment. To minimize disease transmission, persons treated for gonorrhea should be instructed to abstain from sexual activity for 7 days after treatment and until all sex partners are treated (7 days after receiving treatment and resolution of symptoms, if present). All persons who receive a diagnosis of gonorrhea should be tested for other STIs, including chlamydia, syphilis, and HIV. Those persons whose HIV test results are negative should be offered HIV PrEP.

Follow-Up

A test of cure (i.e. repeat testing after completion of therapy) is unnecessary for persons who receive a diagnosis of uncomplicated urogenital or rectal gonorrhea who are treated with any of the recommended or alternative regimens. Any person with pharyngeal gonorrhea should return 7–14 days after initial treatment for a test of cure by using either culture or NAAT; however, testing at 7 days might result in an increased likelihood of false-positive tests. If the NAAT is positive, effort should be made to perform a confirmatory culture before retreatment, especially if a culture was not already collected. All positive cultures for test of cure should undergo antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Symptoms that persist after treatment should be evaluated by culture for N. gonorrhoeae (with or without simultaneous NAAT) and antimicrobial susceptibility. Persistent urethritis, cervicitis, or proctitis also might be caused by other organisms (see Urethritis; Cervicitis; Proctitis).

A high prevalence of N. gonorrhoeae infection has been observed among men and women previously treated for gonorrhea. The majority of these infections result from reinfection caused by failure of sex partners to receive treatment or the initiation of sexual activity with a new infected partner, indicating a need for improved patient education and treatment of sex partners. Men or women who have been treated for gonorrhea should be retested 3 months after treatment regardless of whether they believe their sex partners were treated; scheduling the follow-up visit at the time of treatment is encouraged. If retesting at 3 months is not possible, clinicians should retest whenever persons next seek medical care < 12 months after initial treatment.

### Update to CDC's treatment guidelines for gonococcal infection, 2020 [^111mei5R]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) caused by the bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonococcal infections) have increased 63% since 2014 and are a cause of sequelae including pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility and can facilitate transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Effective treatment can prevent complications and transmission, but N. gonorrhoeae's ability to acquire antimicrobial resistance influences treatment recommendations and complicates control. In 2010, CDC recommended a single 250 mg intramuscular (IM) dose of ceftriaxone and a single 1 g oral dose of azithromycin for treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal infections of the cervix, urethra, and rectum as a strategy for preventing ceftriaxone resistance and treating possible coinfection with Chlamydia trachomatis. Increasing concern for antimicrobial stewardship and the potential impact of dual therapy on commensal organisms and concurrent pathogens, in conjunction with the continued low incidence of ceftriaxone resistance and the increased incidence of azithromycin resistance, has led to reevaluation of this recommendation. This report, which updates previous guidelines, recommends a single 500 mg IM dose of ceftriaxone for treatment of uncomplicated urogenital, anorectal, and pharyngeal gonorrhea. If chlamydial infection has not been excluded, concurrent treatment with doxycycline (100 mg orally twice a day for 7 days) is recommended. Continuing to monitor for emergence of ceftriaxone resistance through surveillance and health care providers' reporting of treatment failures is essential to ensuring continued efficacy of recommended regimens.

### FDA, CDC, and NIH Co-sponsored public workshop summary-development considerations of antimicrobial drugs for the treatment of gonorrhea [^115Gg4nG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

There is an unmet need for developing drugs for the treatment of gonorrhea, due to rapidly evolving resistance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae against antimicrobial drugs used for empiric therapy, an increase in globally reported multidrug resistant cases, and the limited available therapeutic options. Furthermore, few drugs are under development. Development of antimicrobials is hampered by challenges in clinical trial design, limitations of available diagnostics, changes in and varying standards of care, lack of robust animal models, and clinically relevant pharmacodynamic targets. On April 23, 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health co-sponsored a workshop with stakeholders from academia, industry, and regulatory agencies to discuss the challenges and strategies, including potential collaborations and incentives, to facilitate the development of drugs for the treatment of gonorrhea. This article provides a summary of the workshop.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^112epuJC]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Neisseria meningitidis urethritis — diagnosis, transmission, and partner management are noted: Neisseria meningitidis can colonize mucosal surfaces and cause urethritis, and studies indicate it can be transmitted through oral-penile contact (i.e., fellatio). Because N. meningitidis cannot be distinguished from N. gonorrhoeae on Gram stain, identification as the etiologic agent when Gram stain suggests gonococcal urethritis but nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for gonorrhea is negative requires a confirmation by culture. Meningococcal urethritis is treated with the same antimicrobial regimens as gonococcal urethritis, and treatment of sex partners with the same antimicrobial regimens as for exposure to gonococcal infection can be considered.

### Screening recommendations for Chlamydia and gonorrhea [^113Rnb2r]. JAMA Dermatology (2015). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question

Dermatologists diagnose and treat sexually transmitted infections with varying frequency, and have an opportunity to monitor at-risk individuals for chlamydia and gonorrhea. What are the recommended screening guidelines for chlamydia and gonorrhea in men and women in the United States?

Bottom Line

While the evidence for screening men for chlamydia and gonorrhea remains insufficient at this time, all sexually active females younger than 25 years and all older women at risk for infection should be screened for both chlamydia and gonorrhea.

### Update to CDC's treatment guidelines for gonococcal infection, 2020 [^112dvmQM]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Continued support of gonorrhea prevention and control efforts remains fundamental, and preventing antibiotic resistance is crucial. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ceftriaxone indicate that a 500 mg dose in an average-weight U.S. adult achieves sufficiently high serum levels for an adequate duration to eradicate infection, even with wide pharmacokinetic variability. The high frequency of pharyngeal gonorrhea with substantial underscreening and the increased understanding of wide individual pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variability has contributed to the recommendation for the increased ceftriaxone dose. These recommendations also include a test-of-cure for persons with pharyngeal gonorrhea to ensure eradication or detection of a possible treatment failure.

Emerging antimicrobial resistance affects gonorrhea treatment recommendations and other STIs. CDC recommends ceftriaxone monotherapy for treatment because N. gonorrhoeae remains highly susceptible to ceftriaxone, azithromycin resistance is increasing, and prudent use of antimicrobial agents supports limiting their use. Continuing to monitor for emergence of ceftriaxone resistance through surveillance and health care providers' reporting of treatment failures will be essential to ensuring continued efficacy of recommended regimens.

Gonococcal infection among adolescents and adults — screening guidance notes that in the United States, an estimated 1,568,000 new N. gonorrhoeae infections occur each year; annual screening for N. gonorrhoeae infection is recommended for all sexually active women aged < 25 years and for older women at increased risk; men who have sex with men (MSM) at high risk or those at risk for HIV acquisition should be screened at all anatomic sites of exposure every 3–6 months, and at least annual screening is recommended for all MSM; screening among heterosexual men and women aged > 25 years who are at low risk for infection is not recommended.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^117LNFtn]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Uncomplicated gonococcal infection of the pharynx — testing and management considerations note that the majority of gonococcal infections of the pharynx are asymptomatic and can be relatively common among certain populations, are more difficult to eradicate than urogenital and anorectal infections, and few antimicrobial regimens reliably cure > 90% of pharyngeal infections. Providers should ask their patients with urogenital or rectal gonorrhea about oral sexual exposure; if reported, pharyngeal testing should be performed. To maximize adherence and reduce transmission, medication for gonococcal infection should be provided on-site and directly observed; if medications are unavailable when treatment is indicated, linkage to an STI treatment facility should be provided for same-day treatment. To minimize disease transmission, persons treated for gonorrhea should be instructed to abstain from sexual activity for 7 days after treatment and until all sex partners are treated (7 days after receiving treatment and resolution of symptoms, if present).

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^115tfRW8]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) — treatment regimens — should begin empirically at diagnosis, as "Presumptive treatment should be initiated at NGU diagnosis". The recommended regimen is "Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days". Alternative regimens are "Azithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose" or "Azithromycin 500 mg orally in a single dose; then 250 mg orally daily for 4 days". Agents to avoid include "Erythromycin is no longer recommended for NGU because of its gastrointestinal side effects and dosing frequency" and "Levofloxacin is no longer recommended for NGU because of its inferior efficacy, especially for M. genitalium". To maximize adherence, "medications should be dispensed on-site at the clinic, and regardless of the number of doses involved in the regimen, the first dose should be directly observed".

Recommendations

For treatment of uncomplicated urogenital, rectal, or pharyngeal gonorrhea, CDC recommends a single 500 mg IM dose of ceftriaxone (Box). For persons weighing ≥ 150 kg (300 lbs), a single 1 g IM dose of ceftriaxone should be administered. If chlamydial infection has not been excluded, doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for 7 days is recommended. When ceftriaxone cannot be used for treating urogenital or rectal gonorrhea because of cephalosporin allergy, a single 240 mg IM dose of gentamicin plus a single 2 g oral dose of azithromycin is an option. Gastrointestinal symptoms, primarily vomiting within 1 hour of dosing, have been reported among 3%–4% of treated persons. If administration of IM ceftriaxone is not available, a single 800 mg oral dose of cefixime is an alternative regimen. However, cefixime does not provide as high, or as sustained, bactericidal blood levels as does ceftriaxone and demonstrates limited treatment efficacy for pharyngeal gonorrhea.

BOX
CDC recommended regimens for uncomplicated gonococcal infections, 2020

Regimen for uncomplicated gonococcal infections of the cervix, urethra, or rectum:

Ceftriaxone 500 mg IM as a single dose for persons weighing < 150 kg (300 lb)

For persons weighing ≥ 150 kg (300 lb), 1 g of IM ceftriaxone should be administered.
If chlamydial infection has not been excluded, providers should treat for chlamydia with doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days. During pregnancy, azithromycin 1 g as a single dose is recommended to treat chlamydia.

Alternative regimens for uncomplicated gonococcal infections of the cervix, urethra, or rectum if ceftriaxone is not available:

Gentamicin 240 mg IM as a single dose plus azithromycin 2 g orally as a single dose OR

Cefixime 800 mg orally as a single dose. If treating with cefixime, and chlamydial infection has not been excluded, providers should treat for chlamydia with doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days. During pregnancy, azithromycin 1 g as a single dose is recommended to treat chlamydia.

### Azithromycin failure in Mycoplasma genitalium urethritis [^113f48nN]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Azithromycin or doxycycline is recommended treatment for NGU. While treatment-failure in M. genitalium –positive NGU appears common with doxycycline (, –), early reports suggest 1 g azithromycin is more effective, with cure rates of 85%, and that prolonged azithromycin treatment (500 mg on day 1 and 250 mg on days 2–5) eradicates M. genitalium in 95% of cases. However, if treatment-failure after 1 g azithromycin is as prevalent as indicated by our study in M. genitalium –positive NGU, this has implications for the use of single-dose azithromycin as first-line treatment for NGU and leaves few evidence-based treatment options. Information regarding sensitivity of M. genitalium to fluoroquinolones has been limited, but reports suggest differential activity against M. genitalium, with levofloxacin less active than gatifloxacin, sparfloxacin, and tosufloxacin in vitro and in vivo and moxifloxacin more active than levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin in vitro.

We report significant failure rates of azithromycin in M. genitalium –positive NGU that is supported by in vitro evidence of reduced susceptibility to macrolides. Recurrent urethral symptoms following azithromycin therapy only occurred in persons with persistent M. genitalium infection and resolved with moxifloxacin.

Because single-dose azithromycin is recommended treatment for NGU, these findings have implications for treatment guidelines and highlight the need for randomized studies to determine optimal treatment for M. genitalium –positive NGU and M. genitalium infection in women, who are at high risk for sequelae.

### Emerging antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae: urgent need to strengthen prevention strategies [^112RVJZr]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Prevention and control of gonorrhea is an important public health concern due to the high burden of disease, the recent increase in reported infection rates, and the reproductive and economic consequences of infection. Effective antibiotic treatment is one essential component of an integrated approach to gonorrhea control. Over the past 60 years, however, development of resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae to multiple antimicrobial classes challenges this component of gonorrhea control. An integrated, comprehensive prevention strategy should include enhancement of national and international surveillance systems to monitor antimicrobial resistance and new strategies to maximize the benefit and prolong the utility of antimicrobials, including combination regimens, implementation of screening recommendations for individuals at high risk for infection, and the assurance of prompt and effective treatment for infected persons and their sexual partners. Progress in controlling the epidemic and avoiding a resurgence as treatment options wane will require careful attention to all components of a comprehensive prevention strategy.

Chlamydia and gonorrhea — biological understanding and clinical presentation: Chlamydial and gonococcal infections are often asymptomatic in women, untreated infections may progress to PID-related complications such as chronic pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancy, or infertility, and infection may also be transmitted to sex partners and newborn children; accurate screening tests and effective antibiotic treatments are available for chlamydia and gonorrhea. In men, gonococcal infections are more commonly symptomatic compared with women, and serious complications from infection are less common in men.

### Development of new antimicrobials for urogenital gonorrhea therapy: clinical trial design considerations [^111HP8HX]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Gonorrhea remains a major public health challenge, and current recommendations for gonorrhea treatment are threatened by evolving antimicrobial resistance and a diminished pipeline for new antibiotics. Evaluations of potential new treatments for gonorrhea currently make limited use of new understanding of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic contributors to effective therapy, the prevention of antimicrobial resistance, and newer designs for clinical trials. They are hampered by the requirement to utilize combination ceftriaxone/azithromycin therapy as the comparator regimen in noninferiority trials designed to seek an indication for gonorrhea therapy. Evolving gonococcal epidemiology and clinical trial design constraints hinder the enrollment of those populations at the greatest risk for gonorrhea (adolescents, women, and persons infected with antibiotic-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae). This article summarizes a recent meeting on the evaluation process for antimicrobials for urogenital gonorrhea treatment and encourages the consideration of new designs for the evaluation of gonorrhea therapy.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^111VqaEC]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment

Multiple factors should affect the decision to provide presumptive therapy for cervicitis. Presumptive treatment with antimicrobials for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae should be provided for women at increased risk (e.g. those aged < 25 years and women with a new sex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, or a sex partner who has an STI), if follow-up cannot be ensured, or if testing with NAAT is not possible. Trichomoniasis and BV should be treated if detected (see Bacterial Vaginosis; Trichomoniasis). For women at lower risk for STIs, deferring treatment until results of diagnostic tests are available is an option. If treatment is deferred and C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae NAATs are negative, a follow-up visit to determine whether the cervicitis has resolved can be considered.

Recommended Regimen for Cervicitis*
Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days
* Consider concurrent treatment for gonococcal infection if the patient is at risk for gonorrhea or lives in a community where the prevalence of gonorrhea is high (see Gonococcal Infections).
Alternative Regimen
Azithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose

Other Management Considerations

To minimize transmission and reinfection, women treated for cervicitis should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their partners have been treated (i.e. until completion of a 7-day regimen or for 7 days after single-dose therapy) and symptoms have resolved. Women who receive a cervicitis diagnosis should be tested for syphilis and HIV in addition to other recommended diagnostic tests.

Follow-Up

Women receiving treatment should return to their provider for a follow-up visit to determine whether cervicitis has resolved. For women who are untreated, a follow-up visit gives providers an opportunity to communicate test results obtained as part of the cervicitis evaluation. Providers should treat on the basis of any positive test results and determine whether cervicitis has resolved. Women with a specific diagnosis of chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomoniasis should be offered partner services and instructed to return in 3 months after treatment for repeat testing because of high rates of reinfection, regardless of whether their sex partners were treated. If symptoms persist or recur, women should be instructed to return for reevaluation.

Nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) follow-up — Men should be provided their testing results, and those with a specific diagnosis of chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomoniasis should be offered partner services and instructed to return 3 months after treatment for repeat testing. If symptoms persist or recur after therapy completion, men should be instructed to return for reevaluation and should be tested for M. genitalium and T. vaginalis, and symptoms alone without objective signs are insufficient basis for retreatment. Providers should be alert to chronic prostatitis or chronic pelvic pain syndrome in men with pain or voiding symptoms lasting for > 3 months, and men with persistent pain should be referred to a urologist with expertise in pelvic pain disorders.

### Global resistance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae: when theory becomes reality [^112Mnqxf]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on gonococcal urethritis:

- **Definition**: Gonococcal urethritis is a STI of the urethra caused by N. gonorrhoeae.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of gonococcal urethritis involves N. gonorrhoeae invading the urethral epithelium, adhering to epithelial cells, multiplying, and initiating an inflammatory response. The infection is transmitted by direct inoculation of infected secretions from one mucosal surface to another. Antibiotic resistance is associated with specific gene mutations, including penA, penB, and mtrR for penicillin resistance, rpsJ, penB, and mtrR for tetracycline resistance, and gyrA and parC for fluoroquinolone resistance.
- **Epidemiology**: Gonococcal infection is the second most common STI in US, with a reported incidence of 1,264 per 100,000 in men and 1,611 per 100,000 in women.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for gonococcal urethritis include unprotected sexual intercourse, multiple sexual partners, and a history of STIs.
- **Disease course**: The clinical course of gonococcal urethritis typically involves symptoms such as mucopurulent urethral discharge, dysuria, and erythema of the urethral meatus. However, asymptomatic cases can occur, especially in men.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of gonococcal urethritis is generally good with appropriate antibiotic treatment. Untreated cases can lead to complications such as epididymitis, prostatitis, and disseminated gonococcal infection.

### Diagnosis and management of gonococcal infections [^116rTruK]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Neisseria gonorrhoeae causes urogenital, anorectal, conjunctival, and pharyngeal infections. Urogenital tract infections are most common. Men with gonorrhea may present with penile discharge and dysuria, whereas women may present with mucopurulent discharge or pelvic pain; however, women often are asymptomatic. Neonatal infections include conjunctivitis and scalp abscesses. If left untreated, gonorrhea may cause pelvic inflammatory disease in women, or it may disseminate, causing synovial and skin manifestations. Urogenital N. gonorrhoeae infection can be diagnosed using culture or nucleic acid amplification testing. Urine nucleic acid amplification tests have a sensitivity and specificity comparable to those of cervical and urethral samples. Fluoroquinolones are no longer recommended for the treatment of gonorrhea because of antimicrobial resistance. A single intramuscular injection of ceftriaxone, 250 mg, is first-line treatment for uncomplicated urogenital, anorectal, or pharyngeal gonococcal infections. This dosage is more effective for common pharyngeal infections than the previously recommended dose of 125 mg. Ceftriaxone should routinely be accompanied by azithromycin or doxycycline to address the likelihood of coinfection with Chlamydia trachomatis. Azithromycin may be used as an alternative treatment option for patients with previous allergic reactions to penicillin, but because of the likelihood of antimicrobial resistance, its use should be limited. Gonococcal infection should prompt physicians to test for other sexually transmitted infections, including human immunodeficiency virus. Because of high reinfection rates, patients should be retested in three to six months. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for gonorrhea in all sexually active women at increased risk of infection. It also recommends intensive behavioral counseling for persons with or at increased risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections. Condom use is an effective strategy to reduce the risk of infection.

### Update to CDC's sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines, 2010: oral cephalosporins no longer a recommended treatment for gonococcal infections [^111AVDy2]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2012). Low credibility.

Gonorrhea is a major cause of serious reproductive complications in women and can facilitate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission. Effective treatment is a cornerstone of U.S. gonorrhea control efforts, but treatment of gonorrhea has been complicated by the ability of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to develop antimicrobial resistance. This report, using data from CDC's Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP), describes laboratory evidence of declining cefixime susceptibility among urethral N. gonorrhoeae isolates collected in the United States during 2006–2011 and updates CDC's current recommendations for treatment of gonorrhea. Based on GISP data, CDC recommends combination therapy with ceftriaxone 250 mg intramuscularly and either azithromycin 1 g orally as a single dose or doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days as the most reliably effective treatment for uncomplicated gonorrhea. CDC no longer recommends cefixime at any dose as a first-line regimen for treatment of gonococcal infections. If cefixime is used as an alternative agent, then the patient should return in 1 week for a test-of-cure at the site of infection.

### Rationale and ethical assessment of an oropharyngeal gonorrhea controlled human infection model [^115LBFW5]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the causative agent of gonorrhea, causes significant morbidity worldwide and can have long-term impacts on reproductive health. The greatest global burden of gonorrhea occurs in low- and middle-income settings. Global public health significance is increasing due to rising antimicrobial resistance, which threatens future gonorrhea management. The oropharynx is an important asymptomatic reservoir for gonorrhea transmission and a high-risk site for development of antimicrobial resistance and treatment failure. Controlled human infection model (CHIM) studies using N gonorrhoeae may provide a means to accelerate the development of urgently needed therapeutics, vaccines, and other biomedical prevention strategies. A gonorrhea urethritis CHIM has been used since the 1980s with no reported serious adverse events. Here, we describe the rationale for an oropharyngeal gonorrhea CHIM, including analysis of potential ethical issues that should inform the development of this novel study design.

Persistent or Recurrent Nongonococcal Urethritis

The objective diagnosis of persistent or recurrent NGU should be made before considering additional antimicrobial therapy. Symptomatic recurrent or persistent urethritis might be caused by treatment failure or reinfection after successful treatment. Among men who have persistent symptoms after treatment without objective signs of urethral inflammation, the value of extending the duration of antimicrobials has not been demonstrated. Treatment failure for chlamydial urethritis has been estimated at 6%–12%. The most common cause of persistent or recurrent NGU is M. genitalium, especially after doxycycline therapy. Treatment failure for M. genitalium is harder to determine because certain men achieve clinical cure (i.e. resolution of symptoms) but can still have detectable M. genitalium in urethral specimens.

The initial step in recurrent urethritis is assessing compliance with treatment or potential reexposure to an untreated sex partner. If the patient did not comply with the treatment regimen or was reexposed to an untreated partner, retreatment with the initial regimen can be considered. If therapy was appropriately completed and no reexposure occurred, therapy is dependent on the initial treatment regimen. Ideally, diagnostic testing among men with recurrent or persistent symptoms, including those with gonorrhea, chlamydia, M. genitalium, and trichomoniasis, can be used to guide further management decisions.

### CDC grand rounds: the growing threat of multidrug-resistant gonorrhea [^117KWRP4]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

What Public Health Agencies and Partners Can Do

Several steps taken now might delay the emergence of cephalosporin-resistant strains, mitigate the public health consequences of expanded resistance, and prevent a return to the era of untreatable gonorrhea. Local and state STD control programs are encouraged to use local surveillance data to prioritize high-prevalence areas and populations for enhanced primary prevention, screening, or partner services. Clinicians can help prevent sequelae and spread of gonorrhea by eliciting sexual histories from their patients, screening sexually active MSM and high-risk sexually active women for gonorrhea at least annually at exposed anatomic sites, and treating appropriately. Clinicians also can counsel sexually active adults, particularly those living in high prevalence areas, to engage in mutually monogamous partnerships with uninfected partners and to consistently and correctly use latex condoms, which can reduce transmission.

Ensuring effective treatment is critical. Based on surveillance trends, CDC recently updated its treatment recommendations: gonorrhea at any anatomic site should be treated with a single 250 mg intramuscular dose of ceftriaxone plus either 1 g of azithromycin as a single oral dose or 100 mg of doxycycline orally twice daily for 7 days. If this recommended regimen cannot be used, two alternative treatment options exist for urogenital or rectal gonorrhea: 1) if ceftriaxone is not available, clinicians can consider cefixime 400 mg as a single oral dose and either azithromycin 1 g as a single oral dose or doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days, or 2) if the patient is cephalosporin-allergic, clinicians can consider azithromycin 2 g as a single oral dose. If either of these two alternative regimens is prescribed, the patient should return in 1 week for a test of cure. CDC will continue to update treatment recommendations based on surveillance data and clinical research.

### A systematic review and appraisal of the quality of practice guidelines for the management ofinfections [^111ABcbo]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical guidelines help ensure consistent care informed by current evidence. As shifts in antimicrobial resistance continue to influence first-line treatment, up-to-date guidelines are important for preventing treatment failure. A guideline's development process will influence its recommendations and users' trust.

Objective

To assess the quality of current gonorrhoea guidelines' development processes.

Data Sources

Multiple databases.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Original and current English-language guidelines targeting health professionals and containing treatment recommendations for uncomplicated gonorrhoea in the general adult population.

Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods

Two appraisers assessed the guidelines independently using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) tool. Scores were combined as per the AGREE II users' manual.

Results

We identified 10 guidelines meeting the inclusion criteria. The quality of the gonorrhoea treatment guidelines varied. Most scored poorly on Rigour of Development; information on the evidence review process and methods for formulating recommendations was often missing. The WHO Guidelines for the Treatment of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and UK National Guideline for the Management of Gonorrhoea in Adults scored the highest on Rigour of Development. Methods to address conflicts of interest were often not described in the materials reviewed. Implementation of recommendations was often not addressed.

Limitations

By limiting our study to English-language guidelines, a small number of guidelines we identified were excluded. Our analysis was limited to either published or online materials that were readily available to users. We could not differentiate between items addressed in the development process but not documented from items that were not addressed.

Conclusions and Implications Of Key Findings

Gonorrhoea treatment guidelines may slow antimicrobial resistance. Many current guidelines are not in line with the current guideline development best practices; this might undermine the perceived trustworthiness of guidelines. By identifying current limitations, this study can help improve the quality of future guidelines.

PLUS Azithromycin 2 g orally in a single dose If ceftriaxone administration is not available or not feasible: Cefixime 800 mg orally in a single dose If chlamydial infection has not been excluded, providers should treat for chlamydia with doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days. In one clinical trial, dual treatment with single doses of IM gentamicin 240 mg plus oral azithromycin 2 g cured 100% of cases and can be considered an alternative to ceftriaxone for persons with cephalosporin allergy of pharyngeal and 90% of rectal infections were cured with this regimen. Gemifloxacin plus azithromycin has been studied and is no longer recommended as an alternative regimen because of limited availability, cost, and antimicrobial stewardship concerns.

Monotherapy with azithromycin 2 g orally as a single dose has been demonstrated to be 99. 2% effective against uncomplicated urogenital gonorrhea, with the addition of doxycycline if chlamydia infection exists, because reinfections are more likely than actual treatment failures. However, in situations with a higher likelihood of treatment failure than reinfection, relevant clinical specimens should be obtained for culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing before retreatment. Dual treatment with single doses of IM gentamicin 240 mg plus oral azithromycin 2 g can be considered, particularly when isolates are identified as having elevated cephalosporin MICs.

Persons with suspected treatment failure after treatment with the alternative regimen should be treated with ceftriaxone 500 mg as a single IM dose or as a single dose with or without an antichlamydial agent on the basis of chlamydia infection status.

### Intractable problems require novel solutions: it's time to get serious about developing a gonorrhoea vaccine [^115dcPjS]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2016). Low credibility.

Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the causative agent of the sexually transmitted infection gonorrhoea, is an ancient disease with biblical references. Despite ongoing efforts towards treatment and prevention, gonorrhoea remains a major public health problem worldwide with an estimated global incidence of 106 million cases/year, leading to direct and indirect costs that exceed $1 billion/year in the USA alone. The clinical outcomes of gonococcal infection range from asymptomatic infection to severe sequelae (reviewed in refs.). Symptomatic infection typically presents as urethritis in males and cervicitis in females; however, mucosal infections of the rectum, pharynx and eye are also reported. In addition, asymptomatic infections occur in 50–80% of infected females and 1%–40% of infected males, which, if left undiagnosed or untreated, can lead to sequelae that include urogenital tract abscesses, pelvic inflammatory disease, adverse pregnancy outcomes, infertility and neonatal complications. Infection with N. gonorrhoeae also increases the risk of acquiring and transmitting HIV.

Current attempts to control gonorrhoea include safe-sex education, as well as prompt diagnosis and antibiotic treatment of infected persons and their recent sex partners. While diagnostics (ie, nucleic acid amplification tests or bacterial culture) are highly sensitive and specific, education and routine screening are not sufficient to stem the spread of gonorrhoea. This is especially true in light of the fact that extensively drug-resistant strains with high-level resistance to the expanded-spectrum cephalosporins (ie, ceftriaxone and cefixime) have been isolated from around the world. Cephalosporins are the last line of defence for treating gonorrhoea, and the emergence of resistance to these drugs means that more costly and invasive treatment is now required. The current recommendations for the treatment of uncomplicated infections include the use of dual antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone (250 mg intramuscular injection in a single dose) plus azithromycin (1 g orally in a single dose). While additional combinations of existing antibiotics are currently being evaluated, there are no new antibiotics in late development. The gonococcus has developed resistance to all classes of antibiotics used to treat it since the 1940s, including the penicillins, tetracyclines, macrolides and quinolones. As such, even new classes of antibiotics may only provide a short-term solution given the record of N. gonorrhoeae to rapidly develop resistance.

To conduct an economic evaluation of the 4 strategies from a healthcare system perspective, we built a decision tree by using DATA 4.0 (TreeAge Software Inc. Williamstown, MA, USA). Appendix 1 contains schematics of the tree. The gonorrhea-related health outcomes included in the evaluation of each strategy were PID and PID-associated sequelae (chronic pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility). We also included the probability and associated costs of female-to-male transmission of gonorrhea (assuming that all couples are heterosexual). If the male partner is infected, either urethritis or epididymitis could develop and the infection could be transmitted to another female partner (or the original female partner could be reinfected after she has been cured of the initial infection). In the initial female-to-male transmission of gonorrhea, the additional probability and associated costs of cotransmission of HIV exist. Economic outcomes include all diagnostic test-related costs (i.e. cost of supplies, equipment, and labor), direct medical costs of treatment (for pelvic examination and patient recall), cost of treating PID and sequelae (i.e. inpatient and outpatient medical costs), and costs of transmission of gonorrhea and HIV to sex partners (assuming that all couples are heterosexual).

For each strategy (Table 1), we used the decision tree to calculate the expected cost per case of gonorrhea treated, the expected proportion of cases successfully treated (case-patients with no PID or sequelae), and expected cost per case-patient successfully treated. Average and incremental cost-effectiveness analyses, also conducted for a hypothetical cohort of 1 million women treated with each of the 4 alternative strategies, are contained in Appendix 2.

Pelvic inflammatory disease — gonorrhea testing and susceptibility management specify that diagnostic tests for gonorrhea should be obtained before starting therapy; if a culture for gonorrhea is positive, treatment should be based on results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and if the isolate is determined to be quinolone-resistant N. gonorrhoeae or if antimicrobial susceptibility cannot be assessed (e.g., if only NAAT testing is available), consultation with an infectious disease specialist is recommended.

### Screening for Chlamydia and gonorrhea: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^117RhsXY]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF clinician implementation — screening intervals and treatment notes that in the absence of studies on screening intervals, a reasonable approach is to screen patients whose sexual history reveals new or persistent risk factors since the last negative test result, and that chlamydial and gonococcal infections respond to treatment with antibiotics; because treatment varies by patient and antibiotic resistance for gonorrhea is increasing, clinicians are encouraged to consult the most up-to-date guidance on treatment from the CDC.

### Committee opinion no. 645: dual therapy for gonococcal infections [^114fWEkK]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Gonorrhea is the second most commonly reported bacterial sexually transmitted disease in the United States, with an estimated 820,000 new Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections occurring each year. Antimicrobial resistance limits treatment success, heightens the risk of complications, and may facilitate the transmission of sexually transmitted infections. Neisseria gonorrhoeae has developed resistance to the sulfonamides, the tetracyclines, and penicillin. Dual therapy with ceftriaxone and azithromycin remains the only recommended first-line regimen for the treatment of gonorrhea in the United States. Dual therapy with ceftriaxone and azithromycin should be administered together on the same day, preferably simultaneously, and under direct observation. Pregnant women who are infected with N gonorrhoeae should be treated with the recommended dual therapy. A test-of-cure is not needed for individuals diagnosed with uncomplicated urogenital or rectal gonorrhea who are treated with the recommended or alternative regimens. Repeat N gonorrhoeae infection is prevalent among patients who have been diagnosed with and treated for gonorrhea in the preceding several months. Most of these infections result from reinfection; therefore, clinicians should advise patients with gonorrhea to be retested 3 months after treatment. Pregnant women with antenatal gonococcal infection should be retested in the third trimester unless recently treated.

### High prevalence of antibiotic-resistant Mycoplasma genitalium in nongonococcal urethritis: the need for routine testing and the inadequacy of current treatment options [^114kFGD6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Mycoplasma genitalium was a frequent but undiagnosed cause of NGU, as prevalent as C. trachomatis in our symptomatic, mainly heterosexual male cohort. In addition, > 40% of M. genitalium infections had genotypic resistance to macrolide antibiotics, one of the recommended first-line options for NGU. A single patient, approximately 5% of the cohort, was infected with a strain demonstrating genotypic resistance to fluoroquinolones. Patients with M. genitalium infection, with or without genotypic resistance, separated into distinct genotypic clusters and were also related to a diverse population of international control sequence types. This indicated that our findings, rather than being a local clonal phenomenon that could have biased the data, were more likely to represent established infection and resistance rates in this patient population as a whole.

This also complements evidence that selection of macrolide-resistant M. genitalium during suboptimal treatment contributes to cases of treatment failure rather than ongoing horizontal transmission of resistant bacterial strains. Overall, our findings indicate that there is a need to provide routine testing for M. genitalium in those presenting with symptoms of urethritis and perhaps cervicitis and that first-line recommended antimicrobial options for treating these syndromes need reappraisal.

These treatment options will need to take into account the need to have effective regimens against both C. trachomatis and M. genitalium and should question the value of recommending either doxycycline or single-dose azithromycin alone. Whereas extended-dose azithromycin for NGU may be more effective in preventing the development of macrolide resistance and treatment failure, the in vitro and clinical data suggest that it will not work for those carrying 23s rRNA resistance-associated SNPs. Future effective NGU regimens are likely to include fluoroquinolones. Solitary parC mutations, like the one documented in this study, have been reported in cases of fluoroquinolone treatment failure of M. genitalium, and worryingly, there already exist reports of moxifloxacin treatment failure in M. genitalium –associated persistent NGU. Collectively, these findings point to the need to evaluate effectiveness of new treatment strategies, including combination therapies and novel antimicrobials.

Men evaluated in settings in which Gram stain or MB or GV smear is unavailable who meet at least one criterion for urethritis (i.e. urethral discharge, positive leukocyte esterase test on first void urine, or microscopic examination of first-void urine sediment with ≥ 10 WBCs/HPF) should be tested for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae by NAATs and treated with regimens effective against gonorrhea and chlamydia.

If symptoms are present but no evidence of urethral inflammation is present, NAATs for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae might identify infections. Persons with chlamydia or gonorrhea should receive recommended treatment, and sex partners should be referred for evaluation and treatment. If none of these clinical criteria are present, empiric treatment of men with symptoms of urethritis is recommended only for those at high risk for infection who are unlikely to return for a follow-up evaluation or test results. Such men should be treated with drug regimens effective against gonorrhea and chlamydia.

Nongonococcal Urethritis

NGU is a nonspecific diagnosis that can have various infectious etiologies. C. trachomatis has been well established as an NGU etiology; however, prevalence varies across populations and accounts for < 50% of overall cases (,–). M. genitalium is estimated to account for 10%–25% of cases, and T. vaginalis for 1%–8% of cases depending on population and location. Other etiologies include different bacteria, such as Haemophilus species, N. meningitidis, HSV, and adenovirus. However, even when extensive testing is performed, no pathogens are identified in approximately half of cases.

### Preparing for an era of untreatable gonorrhea [^112kp9CK]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The proportion of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates with reduced susceptibility to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs) has increased rapidly since 2006. Clinicians, researchers, and public health officials need to be prepared for the possibility of an era of untreatable gonorrhea. This review focuses on the evidence for current gonorrhea treatment recommendations, potential future treatment options, and other methods to control gonorrhea.

Recent Findings

In addition to an increase in isolates with decreased susceptibility to ESCs, there have been reported treatment failures to both cefixime and ceftriaxone. In response, some countries have increased the recommended cephalosporin dose, and most now recommend dual therapy with an ESC and azithromycin. The pharynx has been implicated as a site for acquiring resistance through transformation with commensal Neisseria species or induced resistance through subtherapeutic antimicrobial levels. Thus, appropriate screening of the pharynx and treatment with a regimen that eradicates gonorrhea from the pharynx is necessary. At present, several studies are evaluating various novel treatment regimens in preparation for an era of untreatable gonorrhea.

Summary

Screening for asymptomatic infections, maintaining culture capacity to monitor antimicrobial resistance, treating with ceftriaxone and azithromycin, and ensuring that all sexual partners are treated are among the best strategies to control gonorrhea in the current clime.

### Diagnosis and treatment of urethritis in men [^111KU4Gg]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Symptoms of urethritis in men typically include urethral discharge, penile itching or tingling, and dysuria. A diagnosis can be made if at least one of the following is present: discharge, a positive result on a leukocyte esterase test in first-void urine, or at least 10 white blood cells per high-power field in urine sediment. The primary pathogens associated with urethritis are Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Racial disparities in the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections persist in the United States, with rates of gonorrhea 40 times higher in black adolescent males than in white adolescent males. Recent studies have focused on identifying causes of nongonococcal urethritis and developing testing for atypical organisms, such as Mycoplasma genitalium and Ureaplasma species. Less common pathogens identified in patients with urethritis include Trichomonas species, adenovirus, and herpes simplex virus. History and examination findings can help distinguish urethritis from other urogenital syndromes, such as epididymitis, orchitis, and prostatitis. The goals of treatment include alleviating symptoms; preventing complications in the patient and his sexual partners; reducing the transmission of coinfections (particularly human immunodeficiency virus); identifying and treating the patient's contacts; and encouraging behavioral changes that will reduce the risk of recurrence. The combination of azithromycin or doxycycline plus ceftriaxone or cefixime is considered first-line empiric therapy in patients with urethritis. Expedited partner treatment, which involves giving patients prescriptions for partners who have not been examined by the physician, is advocated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and has been approved in many states. There is an association between urethritis and an increased human immunodeficiency virus concentration in semen.

### Managing treatment failure in Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection: current guidelines and future directions [^113CJXoo]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Due to the continued emergence of resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotics, clinicians are increasingly more likely to encounter cases of Neisseria gonorrhoeae treatment failure. The current international treatment guidelines offer few regimens for cases of N gonorrhoeae infection that do not respond to first-line therapy, and there are many complexities that should be considered with such regimens; these include regional variations in resistance to alternative agents, access to different antibiotics, and penetration of those antibiotics within different tissues. Further, such regimens do not account for the challenges of treating pharyngeal infections; many patients who have not responded to treatment with extended-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotics to date have had pharyngeal involvement. In addition, pharyngeal infections play a pivotal role in the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance in N gonorrhoeae and are more difficult to treat than urogenital infections because of the unfavourable pharmacokinetics of cephalosporins in pharyngeal tissues. Here, we summarise the current guidelines, provide additional approaches and considerations for clinicians, and highlight knowledge gaps that should be addressed to ensure appropriate therapy in cases of treatment failure.

Management of sex partners — evaluation, treatment, and timing: Partners who have had sexual contact with persons treated for gonorrhea or chlamydia < 60 days before the onset of the persons symptoms should be evaluated, tested, and presumptively treated for the respective infection. Partners of persons with proctitis should be evaluated for any diseases diagnosed in the index partner, sex partners should abstain from sexual contact until they and their partners are treated, and no specific recommendations are available for screening or treating sex partners of persons with diagnosed sexually transmitted enteric pathogens; however, partners should seek care if symptomatic.

Persistent or recurrent nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) — The objective diagnosis should be made before considering additional antimicrobial therapy, with chlamydial urethritis treatment failure estimated at 6%–12% and M. genitalium the most common cause, especially after doxycycline therapy. Initial steps include assessing compliance or reexposure; if noncompliance or reexposure occurred, retreatment with the initial regimen can be considered, whereas if therapy was completed without reexposure, subsequent therapy depends on the initial regimen and diagnostic testing can be used to guide decisions. Where T. vaginalis is prevalent among men who have sex with women, testing and presumptive treatment with metronidazole 2 g orally in a single dose or tinidazole 2 g orally in a single dose are recommended and partners should be referred as needed; if T. vaginalis is unlikely (e.g. MSM or negative T. vaginalis NAAT), test for M. genitalium using an FDA-cleared NAAT. Treatment for M. genitalium includes a two-stage approach ideally using resistance-guided therapy; if resistance testing is not available, doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days followed by moxifloxacin 400 mg orally one day for 7 days should be used, and higher doses of azithromycin have not been effective after azithromycin failures. Men with persistent or recurrent NGU after treatment for M. genitalium or T. vaginalis should be referred to an infectious disease or urology specialist.
