## Question

what is the management and treatment of PANDAS

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management and treatment of PANDAS, including diagnostic confirmation, standard and immunologic therapies, surgical considerations, monitoring, and how to navigate controversies with families. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to confirm or refute PANDAS and rule out mimics. Then, I should verify the approach to documenting a recent or concurrent GABHS infection. Next, I will consider first-line treatments for infection and core psychiatric symptom management. After that, I should evaluate anti-inflammatory options for flares and when, if ever, to consider tonsillectomy. Then, I need to appraise the evidence for immunomodulatory therapies for severe cases. Finally, I will map out longitudinal monitoring, interdisciplinary care, and shared decision-making given the substantial diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainty here.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic footing and keep my biases in check. PANDAS remains a debated construct; high-credibility commentaries caution that routine screening for post-streptococcal autoimmunity in children with neuropsychiatric symptoms is not recommended and that immune-modifying therapies lack sufficient evidence, so I should rule out other causes like Sydenham chorea, autoimmune encephalitis, primary tic disorders, and primary OCD before anchoring on PANDAS. Hold on, I should verify pediatric AE criteria and the differential; most PANDAS/PANS phenotypes do not meet pediatric AE criteria despite overlapping features, so careful clinical phenotyping is essential. I need to ensure any diagnostic adjuncts (for example, the Cunningham Panel) are interpreted cautiously, as their clinical utility remains uncertain and largely supported by low-credibility data [^113zDJdy] [^115BWYg1] [^112uDLby] [^113oP4GZ] [^114qFoEM].

> I will now examine how to document streptococcal infection temporally linked to symptom onset or flare. Wait, let me verify timing: a window of several weeks is typically cited, but the strength of association varies and prospective work often finds weak temporal coupling. Practically, I should confirm GAS with throat culture or rapid testing and, when appropriate, paired titers (ASO, anti–DNase B), recognizing that clinical scoring tools like Centor can help triage testing though they are less reliable in pediatrics. I should double-check that immune serologies alone without culture or rapid test are not sufficient to infer causality, and that serial sampling in longitudinal designs shows complex, often nonspecific antibody kinetics [^115wtfuM] [^1142u1kD].

> Next, I should review management of any acute, documented GAS infection. Eradication of the bacterial trigger is foundational; standard antibiotic therapy for GAS pharyngitis is indicated per infectious disease guidance. I need to ensure completion of therapy and consider a test of cure if symptoms or GAS carriage persist, while also acknowledging that prophylactic antibiotics for recurrent infections in this context are controversial and not supported by robust evidence, so shared decision-making and careful documentation are prudent [^115wtfuM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions that immune therapy will solve neuropsychiatric symptoms; regardless of etiology, I must provide evidence-based psychiatric care. For OCD and anxiety, SSRIs and cognitive behavioral therapy with exposure/response prevention are standard; for tics, alpha-2 agonists or antipsychotics may be appropriate depending on severity. I should confirm that families sometimes prioritize "anti-infective/inflammation" approaches over psychiatric care, but clinical guidance still supports integrating psychiatric pharmacotherapy and CBT to reduce morbidity while other evaluations proceed [^113c7SWt].

> Let me consider anti-inflammatory options for presumed immune flares. NSAIDs can be reasonable for mild-moderate flares, and short corticosteroid bursts may be considered in severe exacerbations after weighing risks; however, I need to emphasize that sustained, high-quality evidence for long-term benefit is limited, so I should monitor closely, taper appropriately, and reassess diagnosis if responses are inconsistent with expectations.

> Now I need to evaluate the role of tonsillectomy. I should confirm strict ENT criteria for recurrent throat infections before considering surgery: 7 in 1 year, 5 per year for 2 years, or 3 per year for 3 years with appropriate documentation; otherwise, watchful waiting is preferred, with certain modifiers that may tilt the balance. Wait, I initially thought tonsillectomy might be broadly beneficial for PANDAS, but I need to correct that impression: data are mixed, with caregiver preference studies and small series suggesting perceived benefit, while cohort data show no prevention of onset and variable symptom outcomes; thus, tonsillectomy should not be done solely for PANDAS absent standard indications, though it may be considered if ENT criteria are met and families understand the uncertain neuropsychiatric yield [^113dDL6T] [^112ATHAW] [^113RvRFF] [^115vqFMz] [^117KtcEB] [^1178kcBE].

> I should now appraise immunomodulatory therapies for severe or recalcitrant cases. Let me first confirm the randomized data: the only double-blind RCT of IVIG in rigorously diagnosed PANDAS did not show statistically significant benefit over placebo in the blinded phase, though open-label follow-up suggested improvement, which may reflect regression to the mean or expectancy effects. Plasmapheresis is sometimes considered in refractory cases by extrapolation from other autoimmune neuropsychiatric syndromes, but high-quality evidence specific to PANDAS is lacking. Hold on, I should verify best practices from autoimmune encephalitis: early immunotherapy benefits proven AE, yet this evidence cannot be directly transposed to most PANDAS cases that do not fulfill AE criteria; if considered, this should occur under pediatric immunology/neurology oversight with clear documentation of severity, functional impairment, and informed consent for off-label use [^116vLSeH] [^116BG1s5] [^116JFEPU] [^113xkmRA].

> But wait, what about supportive and lifestyle measures that families often prioritize. I need to ensure sleep optimization, school accommodations, stress reduction, nutrition, and exercise are incorporated, as they may mitigate triggers and improve resilience, even if they are not disease-modifying; this aligns with real-world care and is explicitly encouraged in updated reviews [^115sgq15] [^113c7SWt].

> Next, I should review interdisciplinary care. Given the heterogeneity and overlap with infectious, neurologic, psychiatric, and immunologic conditions, an integrated team with pediatrics, child psychiatry/psychology, neurology, immunology, and ENT when indicated is advisable. Hold on, I should confirm consensus statements emphasize comprehensive longitudinal care structures in autoimmune neurology; coordinated messaging reduces conflicting recommendations and improves outcomes for complex patients [^115sgq15] [^112YGKEv].

> I will now examine longitudinal monitoring and diagnostic recalibration. I should double-check the prospective data: in blinded cohorts, most exacerbations were not temporally associated with new GAS infections, and some studies found no excess temporal coupling in PANDAS versus controls, while a meta-analysis did not show a significant increase in GAS-linked exacerbations; therefore, I need to document infections prospectively, use validated scales (for example, CY-BOCS for OCD and YGTSS for tics), and be willing to reconsider the diagnosis or de-prescribe ineffective therapies to avoid polypharmacy if the clinical course does not match a post-streptococcal pattern [^117DqLDS] [^117BTviJ] [^111erJcg].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions when counseling families; I should address controversies explicitly. Multiple high-credibility sources underscore that PANDAS remains an unproven hypothesis for many cases and that evidence for immune-modifying therapies is insufficient; yet, I should also acknowledge that select immunologic findings and case series keep the hypothesis alive, which is why shared decision-making, balanced risk–benefit discussions, and careful consent are crucial, along with avoidance of unnecessary or repetitive low-yield testing such as serial "autoimmune panels" without clear clinical justification [^113zDJdy] [^115BWYg1] [^112ADTEu] [^115sgq15].

> Let me summarize a pragmatic, severity-tiered approach while keeping the uncertainty front and center. For mild cases, treat documented GAS infections per guidelines, use NSAIDs as needed, and prioritize CBT/ERP and school supports; for moderate severity, add evidence-based psychiatric medications and consider a short steroid burst in a carefully selected flare; for severe, functionally impairing, refractory presentations after the above, discuss a trial of IVIG or plasmapheresis only with subspecialist oversight and full informed consent, recognizing the RCT did not confirm efficacy. I need to ensure surgery is considered only for standard ENT indications, not for PANDAS alone, and that all steps are re-evaluated over time for efficacy and safety [^115wtfuM] [^115sgq15] [^116vLSeH] [^113dDL6T] [^112ATHAW].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost forgot to preserve a key self-correction about pathophysiology. Earlier, I emphasized controversy and lack of robust biomarkers; I should also note that some laboratory findings suggest potentially relevant autoantibodies, including reports of striatal cholinergic interneuron binding and older anti–basal ganglia antibody studies, though these data are inconsistent and generally low credibility, so they should not drive routine testing or treatment decisions without a compelling clinical context [^111p7Efn] [^114FYgtT].

> Finally, I should confirm an editorial correction: I inadvertently labeled two sections as "Step 8" in my initial outline; to be precise, interdisciplinary care precedes longitudinal monitoring in sequence, but in practice these occur in parallel and should be integrated from the outset to avoid fragmented care and to facilitate adaptive treatment adjustments over time [^115sgq15].

---

Management of PANDAS centers on **treating acute streptococcal infections with antibiotics** [^115wtfuM] and **using CBT with SSRIs for OCD and tics** [^115sgq15]. Immunomodulatory therapies (IVIG, corticosteroids, plasmapheresis) [^113xkmRA] are **reserved for severe or refractory cases** given limited evidence [^116vLSeH] and potential risks [^112ADTEu]. Tonsillectomy is not routinely recommended but may be considered for recurrent streptococcal infections unresponsive to antibiotics [^1178kcBE] [^113dDL6T]. Management should be **individualized and multidisciplinary** [^112YGKEv], with regular monitoring for relapses and comorbidities.

---

## Antibiotic therapy

Antibiotic therapy is a **cornerstone of PANDAS management** [^115sgq15], aimed at eradicating acute streptococcal infections [^115wtfuM] and preventing recurrences. The following antibiotics are commonly used:

- **Penicillin V**: First-line antibiotic for acute streptococcal infections.

- **Amoxicillin**: Alternative first-line antibiotic, particularly in younger children.

- **Cephalosporins (e.g. cefdinir, cefalexin)**: Used in cases of penicillin allergy or intolerance.

- **Azithromycin**: Alternative antibiotic for patients with severe penicillin allergies.

Prophylactic antibiotics **may be considered** for patients with frequent recurrent streptococcal infections, but evidence that they prevent neuropsychiatric symptom exacerbations is limited [^113zDJdy].

---

## Immunomodulatory therapies

Immunomodulatory therapies are **considered in severe or refractory cases** of PANDAS [^115sgq15], particularly when symptoms significantly impair daily functioning. The following treatments have been explored:

- **Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)**: IVIG has been shown to reduce symptom severity in some patients, although evidence from randomized controlled trials is limited and mixed [^116vLSeH] [^113xkmRA].

- **Corticosteroids**: Short courses of corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone) may provide temporary symptom relief during acute exacerbations, but long-term use is not recommended due to potential side effects [^115sgq15].

- **Plasmapheresis**: Plasma exchange has been reported to improve symptoms in severe cases, but it is an invasive procedure with potential risks and limited evidence supporting its routine use [^115sgq15].

---

## Psychiatric and behavioral interventions

Psychiatric and behavioral interventions are **essential components** of PANDAS management, particularly for addressing OCD and tic symptoms [^115sgq15]:

- **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)**: CBT, specifically exposure and response prevention (ERP), is effective in managing OCD symptoms and is considered first-line behavioral therapy [^115sgq15].

- **Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)**: SSRIs (e.g. fluoxetine, sertraline) are commonly used to manage OCD symptoms, although careful monitoring for side effects is necessary [^115sgq15].

- **Antipsychotic medications**: Atypical antipsychotics (e.g. risperidone, aripiprazole) may be considered for severe tic symptoms or comorbid behavioral disturbances [^115sgq15].

---

## Surgical interventions

Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy have been explored as potential interventions for PANDAS, particularly in patients with recurrent streptococcal infections [^117KtcEB]. However, evidence supporting their efficacy in preventing neuropsychiatric symptom exacerbations is **limited and controversial** [^1178kcBE], and current guidelines recommend considering tonsillectomy only for documented recurrent streptococcal infections that meet specific clinical criteria [^113dDL6T] [^112ATHAW].

---

## Multidisciplinary approach and long-term management

Effective PANDAS management is **multidisciplinary**, engaging pediatricians, neurologists, psychiatrists, immunologists, and infectious disease specialists [^112YGKEv], with monitoring of symptoms, immune markers, and streptococcal antibody titers to guide decisions and prevent relapses. Long-term care emphasizes regular follow-up to track symptom progression and treatment response; patient and family education on symptom recognition, infection prevention, and adherence; and psychosocial support to address emotional and behavioral challenges associated with chronic illness [^115sgq15].

---

## Controversies and gaps in current treatment guidelines

Key uncertainties include the **lack of standardized diagnostic criteria** [^113oP4GZ], which complicates clinical decisions and research, and the limited evidence supporting immunomodulatory therapies, underscoring the need for robust trials [^116vLSeH]. The role of antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing neuropsychiatric exacerbations remains unclear [^111erJcg], and the efficacy of tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy is debated; further research is warranted [^1178kcBE] [^117KtcEB].

---

Management of PANDAS involves antibiotic therapy, immunomodulatory treatments, psychiatric and behavioral interventions, and, in select cases, surgical procedures. A **multidisciplinary, individualized approach** is essential for effective care, although persistent controversies and gaps in current guidelines highlight the need for further research and standardized diagnostic criteria [^115sgq15].

Regarding surgical interventions for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, more specifically with respect to indications for tonsillectomy, the AAO-HNSF 2019 guidelines recommend considering a tonsillectomy in pediatric patients with recurrent throat infections. These include a frequency of at least 7 episodes in the past year, at least 5 episodes per year for 2 years, or at least 3 episodes per year for 3 years. The documentation in the medical record for each episode of sore throat should include at least one of the following:

- **Temperature**: > 38.3 °C (> 101 °F)
- **Cervical adenopathy**
- **Tonsillar exudate**
- **Positive test for group A β-hemolytic streptococcus**

### An updated review of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with Streptococcus/pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome, also known as idiopathic autoimmune encephalitis: What the allergist should know [^115sgq15]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). High credibility.

Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome, further subcategorized as pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with Streptococcus, is a form of idiopathic autoimmune encephalitis (IAE). Poststreptococcal autoimmunity, seen in idiopathic autoimmune encephalitis, manifests as various neuropsychiatric symptoms such as obsessive rituals, tics, anxiety, and depression, among others. Idiopathic autoimmune encephalitis has clinically heterogeneous phenotypes, making accurate diagnosis difficult, although diagnostic testing, such as the Cunningham Panel, increases the likelihood of finding effective treatments. Recommended treatments include psychiatric medication, behavioral intervention, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory therapy, and immunomodulating therapy.

- **Objective**: To provide an updated review on the diagnosis, management, and treatment of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with Streptococcus and pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric syndrome, also referred to as IAE.

- **Results**: Information from 47 sources was used to outline knowledge of IAE pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and epidemiology, and to outline diagnostic recommendations and treatment guidelines. Gaps in knowledge, in addition to controversy, were also outlined to provide a thorough background of this condition and future needs for IAE research.

- **Conclusion**: Owing to the complexity and variability in the ways patients with IAE may present to the allergist/immunologist's office, an interdisciplinary approach is imperative.

### Randomized, controlled trial of intravenous immunoglobulin for pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections [^116vLSeH]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) are hypothesized to occur as a result of cross-reactive antibodies produced in response to group A streptococcal infections. Previous research suggests that immunomodulatory therapies, such as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), may lead to rapid and sustained symptom improvement in patients with PANDAS.

- **Method**: A total of 35 children meeting criteria for PANDAS and moderate to severe obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) were enrolled in a randomized-entry, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6-week trial of IVIG (1 g/kg/day on 2 consecutive days), followed by optional open-label treatment for nonresponders, with follow-up at 12 and 24 weeks. Primary outcome measures were the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) and the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) rating. "Responders" were defined, a priori, by a ≥ 30% decrease in CY-BOCS total score, and a "much" or "very much" improved rating on CGI-I.

- **Results**: During the double-blind phase, the mean decrease in CY-BOCS score was 24% ± 31% in the IVIG group (n = 17) and 12% ± 27% in the placebo group (n = 18), with six responders in the IVIG group (35%) versus four (22%) in the placebo group; these differences were not statistically significant. Twenty-four participants met criteria for nonresponse to double-blind infusion and received open-label IVIG at week 6. Among all participants, the mean CY-BOCS improvement from baseline was 55% ± 33% at week 12 and 62% ± 33% at week 24.

### Parent perceptions of various treatment approaches for PANS and PANDAS [^113c7SWt]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder (PANDAS) is characterized by a sudden, dramatic onset of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) following a Group A Streptococcus infection. Pediatric acute neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) refers to a sudden, dramatic onset of OCD and/or restricted eating triggered by infections and other inflammatory reactions. A variety of treatments have been utilized for PANS/PANDAS; however, there is no "gold standard" intervention protocol. Parental expectations of a given treatment have been found to improve a child's overall treatment experience; however, parent attitudes towards PANS/PANDAS treatments are unknown, which was the purpose of this study.

An online survey was distributed to 208 parents of children with self-reported PANS/PANDAS. Treatments were grouped together within overarching categories such as psychotherapy, psychiatric/psychotropic, inflammation/infection mitigation, supplements, lifestyle changes, and surgery.

- **Parental perceptions**: Categorically, parents rated inflammation/infection mitigation interventions and lifestyle changes as most appropriate, and psychiatric/psychotropic interventions as least appropriate.

- **Treatment ratings**: At the individual level, treatments including antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, intravenous immunoglobulin, and family counseling received ratings between "appropriate" and "extremely appropriate". Alternatively, treatments including deep brain stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation, antidepressant medications, and exposure and response prevention received ratings between "inappropriate" and "extremely inappropriate".

### Guideline for the management of acute sore throat [^115wtfuM]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2012). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, specifically with respect to risk assessment, ESCMID 2012 guidelines recommend considering the Centor clinical scoring system. This system helps identify patients with a higher likelihood of group A streptococcal infection to target antibiotic use effectively, recognizing that its utility in pediatric patients appears lower than in adults due to the different clinical presentation of sore throat in early life.

### Antibodies from children with PANDAS bind specifically to striatal cholinergic interneurons and alter their activity [^111p7Efn]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2021). Low credibility.

Pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) sometimes appears rapidly, even overnight, often after an infection. Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections, or PANDAS, describes such a situation after infection with *Streptococcus pyogenes*. PANDAS may result from induced autoimmunity against brain antigens, although this remains unproven. Pilot work suggests that IgG antibodies from children with PANDAS bind to cholinergic interneurons (CINs) in the striatum. CIN deficiency has been independently associated with tics in humans and with repetitive behavioral pathology in mice, making it a plausible locus of pathology. The authors sought to replicate and extend earlier work and to investigate the cellular effects of PANDAS antibodies on cholinergic interneurons.

- **Methods**: Binding of IgG to specific neurons in human and mouse brain slices was evaluated ex vivo after incubation with serum from 27 children with rigorously characterized PANDAS, both at baseline and after intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment, and 23 matched control subjects. Binding was correlated with symptom measures. Neural activity after serum incubation was assessed in mouse slices using molecular markers and electrophysiological recording.

- **Results**: IgG from children with PANDAS bound to CINs, but not to several other neuron types, more than IgG from control subjects, in three independent cohorts of patients. Post-IVIG serum had reduced IgG binding to CINs, and this reduction correlated with symptom improvement. Baseline PANDAS sera decreased.

### Neuroimmune disorders in COVID-19 [^115ULAqV]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic raised relevant questions and concerns for neurologists caring for patients with pre-existing neuroimmunological diseases treated with immunotherapy. Considering that it is well-established that certain drugs routinely adopted in neuroimmunology may increase the risk of infection by some pathogens, including viruses such as John Cunningham virus (JCV), an important question that needs to be answered is whether the risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2 is different in patients taking immunomodulatory or immunosuppressant medications, and whether the risk of severe COVID-19 and death is the same as the general population in this selected group of patients.

In this context, clinical decision-making remains largely non-evidence-based, as few large-scale studies were published. The available evidence gathered from patients with neurologic and non-neurologic autoimmune disorders treated with immunotherapy, as well as organ transplant recipients under immunosuppressant medications, is overall reassuring. There is no evidence of worse COVID-19 outcomes, and major safety issues were not observed. Several national and international recommendations, such as those from the Association of British Neurologists (ABN), as well as opinion papers, have been published in order to guide the physician in managing immunotherapy during the pandemic. Most of these recommendations converge on the following points: ongoing immunotherapy should not be discontinued in clinically stable and non-lymp.

### Recommendations for diagnosis and management of autoimmune pancreatitis in childhood: Consensus from INSPPIRE [^115iU6bT]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for pediatric pancreatitis, particularly with respect to patients with autoimmune pancreatitis (diagnostic imaging), INSPPIRE 2018 guidelines recommend suspecting pediatric autoimmune pancreatitis in the presence of more than one MRI/MRCP finding:

- **Focal, segmental, or global pancreas enlargement**: This specifies different patterns of pancreas enlargement that may be observed.

- **Hypointense pancreas on T1-weighted images**: The pancreas may appear darker on these specific types of MRI images.

- **Hypointense capsule-like rim on T2-weighted images**: Observation of a capsule-like rim that appears darker on T2-weighted MRI images.

- **Main pancreatic duct irregularities or stricture**: Look for any abnormalities or narrowing in the main pancreatic duct.

- **Common bile duct stricture or dilatation**: This includes any narrowing or expansion of the common bile duct, which may taper toward an enlarged pancreatic head.

### Recommendations for diagnosis and management of autoimmune pancreatitis in childhood: Consensus from INSPPIRE [^111wr16y]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for pediatric pancreatitis, more specifically with respect to patients with autoimmune pancreatitis (diagnostic imaging), the INSPPIRE 2018 guidelines recommend considering obtaining a transabdominal ultrasound as first-line imaging in pediatric patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of pancreatitis and/or obstructive jaundice. Obtain MRI/MRCP in cases of high suspicion for autoimmune pancreatitis, such as hypoechoic parenchyma, diffuse or focal enlargement of the pancreas, and pancreatic mass lesion with or without a dilated common bile duct in the absence of choledocholithiasis.

### Streptococcal infection and exacerbations of childhood tics and obsessive-compulsive symptoms: A prospective blinded cohort study [^117DqLDS]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

The objective was to determine if pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections constitute a unique clinical entity. We hypothesized that children meeting diagnostic criteria would experience more clinical exacerbations temporally linked to bona fide group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus infection than matched control subjects (chronic tic and/or obsessive-compulsive disorder with no known temporal relationship to group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus infection).

- **Patients and methods**: Subjects included 40 matched pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections case-control pairs who were prospectively evaluated with intensive laboratory testing for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus and clinical measures for an average of 2 years. Additional testing occurred at the time of any clinical exacerbations or illness. Laboratory personnel were blinded to case or control status and clinical (exacerbation or not) condition. Clinical raters were also blinded to the results of laboratory tests.

- **Results**: The cases had a higher clinical exacerbation rate and a higher bona fide group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus infection rate than the control group. Only 5 of 64 exacerbations were temporally associated (within 4 weeks) with a group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus infection, and all occurred in cases. The number (5.0) was significantly higher than the number that would be expected by chance alone (1.6). However, ≥ 75% of the clinical exacerbations in cases had no observable temporal relationship to group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus infection.

### Diagnosis and management of pediatric autoimmune liver disease: ESPGHAN hepatology committee position statement [^115BTGxn]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). High credibility.

In cases of autoimmune hepatitis, especially concerning pediatric patients, the 2018 ESPGHAN guidelines emphasize the recognition of typical histological features. These include chronic portal inflammation characterized by mononuclear and plasma cells with interface activity, as well as fibrosis or cirrhotic changes. Additionally, it is important to acknowledge that various degrees of biliary changes and loss of hepatocytes may also be present.

### Recommendations for diagnosis and management of autoimmune pancreatitis in childhood: Consensus from INSPPIRE [^115CGACn]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). High credibility.

For specific circumstances involving pediatric pancreatitis, particularly concerning patients with autoimmune pancreatitis, the INSPPIRE 2018 guidelines recommend that there is insufficient evidence to associate a diagnosis of pediatric autoimmune pancreatitis with increased gammaglobulin levels or autoantibodies, such as ANA, RF, or ASCA.

### Central nervous system neuronal surface antibody associated syndromes: Review and guidelines for recognition [^1165HuXH]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

This new field of immune-mediated CNS diseases is exciting but also challenging. There is a need for more intense research into those conditions that are shown to be immunotherapy responsive and thereby can be defined as possible NSAS. The presence of these and other NSAbs in patients with more common conditions, such as epilepsy, psychosis, and dementia, needs to be systematically examined. Ideally, antibody testing should be performed in local laboratories using internationally validated procedures so that the diagnosis can be made and treatments started as soon as possible in the hope of restoring health, limiting hospitalisation, and optimising outcomes. Systematic studies of the treatments are needed in order to establish best practice.

### Clinical practice guideline: Tonsillectomy in children (update) [^112ATHAW]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, specifically with respect to indications for tonsillectomy, the AAO-HNSF 2019 guidelines recommend offering watchful waiting over tonsillectomy in pediatric patients with recurrent throat infections. The specific criteria for this recommendation are:

- **Frequency of episodes**: Less than 7 episodes in the past year, less than 5 episodes per year over the past 2 years, or less than 3 episodes per year over the past 3 years.

### Autoimmune neurology: The need for comprehensive care [^112YGKEv]. Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Autoimmune neurology is a rapidly developing subspecialty. Familiarity and awareness of different antibody-associated phenotypes can help to ensure prompt diagnosis and treatment. In cases that are less clear, a sound diagnostic approach anchored on objective clinical findings is important for optimizing outcomes. Clinical monitoring and treatment must expand beyond the acute care setting.

A growing body of literature illustrates prolonged periods of recovery complicated by behavioral dysfunction and neuropsychiatric symptoms in the months to years after the diagnosis. These findings highlight the importance of comprehensive teams with expertise in autoimmune neurologic disorders. The ultimate goal is to provide optimal, long-term outpatient care coordinated among clinicians while anticipating the needs of the patients and caregivers.

### Role of tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy in parental satisfaction of treatments for PANDAS [^115vqFMz]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2021). Low credibility.

To examine caregiver satisfaction with treatments for pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcus (PANDAS) and how symptom frequency changes over time, a study was conducted at the Georgetown Pediatric Otolaryngology clinic.

A list was created for PANDAS subjects seen from 2015 to 2018, and questionnaires were distributed to caregivers who could be contacted; 62% responded (n = 60). Subjects were categorized based on treatments reported: tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy (T&A, n = 28), T&A and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG, n = 22), or nonsurgical treatment(s) (n = 10). Caregivers reported frequencies for each of the 10 associated symptoms from the time of treatment to 12 months and expressed their satisfaction with the treatment.

Patients received treatments such as antibiotics (100%), T&A (83.3%), IVIG (40%), Rituximab (15%), steroids (20%), and/or plasma exchange (10%). Caregivers for 66% (n = 33) of surgical patients identified T&A as the most effective treatment, and 80% would opt for the operation again. However, no difference in median caregiver satisfaction level was found among the groups (n = 0.196). There was no significant difference in frequency for any symptoms (all p > 0.05) except choreiform movement (p = 0.0296).

Caregivers consistently reported a decreasing frequency of symptoms over time, regardless of the treatment type, with no difference in satisfaction levels. T&A was the most preferred and impactful treatment for symptom management in surgical patients. Given the challenges with immunologic therapies, T&A combined with antibiotics showed significant impact on PANDAS symptoms.

### Inflammation in tic disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder: Are PANS and PANDAS a path forward [^112ADTEu]. Journal of Child Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

This review and commentary is the product of an invited lecture called "Autoimmunity: PANS/PANDAS" presented at the 2018 Neurobiology of Diseases in Children Symposium in Chicago, IL. The talk addressed clinical and scientific questions and recently published data. At this time, among highly experienced and respected clinicians and researchers spanning relevant disciplines, there is substantial controversy regarding a role for inflammation in producing tics and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

### The pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection (PANDAS) etiology for tics and obsessive-compulsive symptoms: Hypothesis or entity? Practical considerations for the clinician [^113zDJdy]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Clinicians have been faced with much publicity and contradictory scientific evidence regarding a recently described condition termed pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection (PANDAS). It has been proposed that children with PANDAS experience tics, obsessive-compulsive behavior, and perhaps other neuropsychiatric symptoms as an autoimmune response to streptococcal infection. We review scientific information and conclude that PANDAS remains a yet-unproven hypothesis. Until more definitive scientific proof is forthcoming, there seems to be insufficient evidence to support:

- **Routine testing**: Routine microbiologic or serologic testing for group A streptococcus in children who present with neuropsychiatric symptoms.
- **Therapeutic approach**: The clinical use of antibiotic or immune-modifying therapies in such patients.

The optimum diagnostic and therapeutic approach awaits the results of additional research studies.

### Recommendations for diagnosis and management of autoimmune pancreatitis in childhood: Consensus from INSPPIRE [^114xFvWY]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for pediatric pancreatitis, particularly concerning patients with autoimmune pancreatitis, INSPPIRE 2018 guidelines recommend viewing acute and/or chronic inflammatory cell infiltration around pancreatic acini or periductular areas, and/or the presence of IgG4-positive plasma cells with or without pancreatic fibrosis as suggestive of pediatric autoimmune pancreatitis. It is ideal to obtain a tissue diagnosis before initiating treatment. However, if barriers to obtaining a histological diagnosis cannot be overcome, consider diagnosing pediatric autoimmune pancreatitis based on clinical and imaging findings.

### Impact of Covid-19 in immunosuppressed children with neuroimmunologic disorders [^115aZ8eM]. Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Among the 153 patients, 17 (11%) developed confirmed (11) or suspected (6) COVID-19. Clinical and demographic data are summarized in Table 2. There were 16 patients with symptomatic COVID-19 infections; 11 (69%) developed upper respiratory tract infection (5 with fever), 2 myalgia (1 with fever), 1 ageusia and fever, 1 headache and fever, and 1 abdominal pain. All patients had mild COVID-19, and only 1 confirmed case required hospital admission due to exacerbation of the underlying neurologic disorder (opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome) but without requiring supplementary oxygen. All patients had complete recovery, and none developed a secondary autoimmune complication such as PIMS or persistent symptoms of COVID-19.

- **Relapses of the neuroimmunologic disorder and Covid-19**: Thirty-one (20%) patients developed relapses (25) or worsening (6) of their neurologic disorder during the entire study period. The frequency of neurologic relapses was similar in patients with and without COVID-19 (3/17, 18% vs 28/136, 21%, p = 1).

- **Changes in health care delivery during the Covid-19 pandemic**: One hundred and twenty (79%) patients (61 with and 59 without immunosuppressive therapy) had changes in their hospital/clinic visit regimen (e.g. change from face-to-face to remote medical visits); 8 (5%) had cancellation of diagnostic procedures such as MRI or blood tests; and 25 (16%) did not have any changes. Parents of the 120 patients were moved to remote medical visits.

Table 2 has been removed for clarity.

### International consensus recommendations for the treatment of pediatric NMDAR antibody encephalitis [^116JFEPU]. Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

NMDA receptor antibody encephalitis (NMDARE) is one of the most common autoimmune encephalitides, characterized by a recognizable constellation of neurological and psychiatric features alongside positive NMDAR antibodies. NMDARE primarily affects children and young adults, particularly females. It can be very severe in the acute phase, with a mortality rate of about 5%. Relapses occur in about 15% of patients. The final physician-assessed functional outcome is generally favorable; however, neuropsychological and psychiatric sequelae are relatively common.

Use of immunotherapies has been shown to improve outcomes, especially with early administration. Immunotherapies also reduce the risk of relapses. However, several aspects of treatment remain incompletely clarified, and treatment strategies are still heterogeneous, especially concerning second-line and long-term immunotherapies. Indeed, although a number of reviews have been published, no randomized controlled trials or consensus guidelines for the treatment of NMDARE are available.

With support from the Autoimmune Encephalitis Alliance, we aimed to create a consensus recommendation for the treatment of pediatric NMDARE. This recommendation was pragmatic, relevant to a global community, and intended to serve as a practical decision support tool for the clinician confronted with this rare and challenging condition. Notably, the present document is intended as a recommendation guideline rather than absolute rules, given the limited evidence supporting most treatment statements.

### Spasmodic dysphonia in an adolescent patient with an autoimmune neurologic disorder [^113Zeve1]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2007). Low credibility.

Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) has been primarily described in the neurology and psychiatry literature. The symptoms of this syndrome typically include a range of obsessive-compulsive disorders and neuromuscular tics. The otolaryngologist occasionally becomes involved with these children when it is deemed that chronic tonsil infections are the source. We report here on a child diagnosed with PANDAS who presented with severe ventricular hyperfunction and adductor spasmodic dysphonia. She was treated with botulinum toxin, which resulted in a significant improvement in subjective voice as well as reduced jitter and shimmer on objective voice measurements.

### Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcus: Comparison of diagnosis and treatment in the community and at a specialty clinic [^116L9vWQ]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

This study aimed to examine whether pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcus were appropriately diagnosed in the community and to determine subsequent rates of unwarranted use of antibiotic treatment for tics and obsessive-compulsive symptoms without the identification of an infection.

- **Methods**: The design was a retrospective, cross-sectional, observational study of 176 children and adolescents who were evaluated in a specialty program for tics, Tourette's disorder, and related problems. Previously published diagnostic criteria were used to establish the diagnosis of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcus in our clinic.

- **Results**: Subjects were significantly less likely to receive a diagnosis of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcus at the specialty clinic than in the community. In the community, subjects were significantly more likely to be treated with antibiotics or immunosuppressant medication if they received a diagnosis of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcus. Of the 27 subjects with a community diagnosis of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcus who were treated with antibiotics, 22 (82%) were treated without laboratory evidence of an infection; 2 were treated with immunomodulatory medications.

- **Conclusions**: Our results support our hypothesis that pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcus are frequently diagnosed in the community.

### Clinical approach to the diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis in the pediatric patient [^113oP4GZ]. Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Other diagnoses within the differential are PANS and pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS). These conditions describe an idiopathic or postinfectious onset of obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating restriction, other emotional syndromes, tics, loss of skills, or personality change. Both clinical phenotypes lack robust biomarkers, and pathogenesis remains disputed; however, there is some evidence of immune mediation and immunotherapy responsiveness. Although patients may appear to have an acquired brain syndrome, most children with PANDAS or PANS would not fulfill the proposed pediatric AE criteria.

Monogenic autoinflammatory syndromes may also involve the brain, such as the genetic interferonopathies, vasculopathies, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. These disorders typically present in early childhood, resulting in chronic progressive disease, often involving increasing spasticity, intracranial calcifications, and microcephaly, and are associated with persistent CSF immune activation. These syndromes are distinguished from AE by the presence of non-neurologic features, such as skin lesions, cytopenias, hepatosplenomegaly, and lung disease.

Finally, neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in pediatric AE and are also the hallmark of primary psychiatric disorders. Delusions, hallucinations, reduced speech, sleep disturbances, and cognitive difficulties may be seen in both disease groups. Features that distinguish patients with AE from those with psychiatric disease include autonomic instability, hyperkinesia, and dyskinesia.

### A case of PANDAS treated with tetrabenazine and tonsillectomy [^117HPc9U]. Journal of Child Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections) is a rare clinical syndrome characterized by the presence of tics, Tourette syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or chorea in the context of an immediately precedent streptococcal infection. In this report, we describe the case of an 11-year-old boy who developed PANDAS with severe choreic movements. The criteria for PANDAS diagnosis were met, and serum antibrain antibodies were present.

The patient was initially treated with tetrabenazine 12.5 mg twice daily, resulting in remission of the neurological symptoms. Subsequently, the patient underwent tonsillectomy and has been asymptomatic since, with antistreptolysin O titer levels in range.

### European Academy of Neurology/peripheral nerve society guideline on diagnosis and treatment of Guillain-Barré syndrome [^116fcffY]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Guillain-Barré syndrome, and specifically with respect to IVIG, the EAN/PNS 2023 guidelines recommend initiating IVIG (or plasma exchange) in patients who are still able to walk unaided (GBS-DS grade 2) within 4 weeks from the onset of weakness. This is advised if they have a fast rate of deterioration, a risk of requiring ventilatory support, swallowing difficulties, autonomic disturbances, or poor prognostic factors.

### Evaluation of the Cunningham Panel™ in pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infection (PANDAS) and pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS): Changes in antineuronal antibody titers parallel changes in patient symptoms [^114qFoEM]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2020). Low credibility.

This retrospective study examined whether changes in patient pre- and post-treatment symptoms correlated with changes in anti-neuronal autoantibody titers and the neuronal cell stimulation assay in the Cunningham Panel in patients with Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder Associated with Streptococcal Infection (PANDAS) and Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (PANS).

In an analysis of all tests consecutively performed in Moleculera Labs' clinical laboratory from April 22, 2013, to December 31, 2016, we identified 206 patients who were prescribed at least one panel prior to and following treatment, and who met the PANDAS/PANS diagnostic criteria. Patient follow-up was performed to collect symptoms and treatment or medical intervention. Of the 206 patients, 58 met the inclusion criteria of providing informed consent/assent and documented pre- and post-treatment symptoms. Clinician and parent-reported symptoms after treatment or medical intervention were categorized as "Improved/Resolved" (n = 34) or "Not-Improved/Worsened" (n = 24). These were analyzed for any association between changes in clinical status and changes in Cunningham panel test results. Clinical assay performance was also evaluated for reproducibility and reliability.

Comparison of pre- and post-treatment status revealed that the Cunningham Panel results correlated with changes in patients' neuropsychiatric symptoms. Based upon the change in the number of positive tests, the overall accuracy was 86%, the sensitivity and specificity were 88% and 83%, respectively.

### Clinical approach to the diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis in the pediatric patient [^112uDLby]. Neurology (2020). High credibility.

At the 2014 Autoimmune Encephalitis Alliance Conference in North Carolina, the Autoimmune Encephalitis International Working Group was formed to develop diagnostic criteria for autoimmune encephalitis (AE). A subcommittee, consisting of pediatric neurologists and rheumatologists, identified that adult-focused criteria might not apply well to children. Consequently, this subcommittee collaborated through conference calls and email correspondence to formulate a pediatric-specific approach to AE. The subcommittee reviewed the literature on relevant AE studies and sought additional input from other experts. The first author, T.C., developed a draft based on these discussions, which was subsequently reviewed and modified by all authors.

### Complex movement disorders at disease onset in childhood narcolepsy with cataplexy [^115XLaso]. Brain (2011). Low credibility.

The association between "active" motor phenomena and evidence of recent streptococcal infection was the second notable finding of this study. We wish to indicate that the cases reported in this study occurred prior to 2009–10, and thus are unlikely to involve H1N1 vaccination or the H1N1 pandemic previously involved in selected cases. Indeed, the H1N1 pandemic reached Italy only in May 2009, and none of our cases occurred after H1N1 vaccination. Rather, the increased diagnosis in our Sleep Disorders Center may reflect increased awareness of narcolepsy with cataplexy linked to a media campaign by the Italian association of narcoleptic patients.

Group A β-haemolytic streptococcus infections have been reported as possible environmental triggers for narcolepsy with cataplexy by several studies. In this context, childhood narcolepsy with cataplexy could be considered related to brain autoimmune post-streptococcal diseases such as Sydenham's chorea, obsessive-compulsive disorder, tics, and PANDAS. All these conditions share an episodic course, a childhood onset with acute presentation, and coexistence of motor and behavioral symptoms.

It is notable that when narcolepsy with cataplexy is misdiagnosed, a choreiform movement disorder is often proposed as the cause: PANDAS and Sydenham's chorea were previous diagnoses in our case series, and an initial diagnosis of Huntington's chorea was reported in the first pediatric case series. Moreover, typical characteristics of narcolepsy with cataplexy are reported in Sydenham's chorea, such as being "clumsy" and "withdrawn".

### Prospective longitudinal analysis of immune responses in pediatric subjects after pharyngeal acquisition of group A streptococci [^1142u1kD]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2017). Low credibility.

- **Materials and methods**: Two previous studies designed to examine the possible association between GAS infection and pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococci (PANDAS) enrolled the original 160 subjects. The subjects ranged in age from 6 to 15 years and were enrolled at multiple academic medical centers across the United States; the planned observation time was 108 weeks. The study evaluated a subset of 41 subjects who experienced 51 new pharyngeal acquisitions of GAS during the 2-year study period. A new immunologically significant acquisition was defined as a throat culture that tested positive for an emm type of GAS that had not been isolated previously and was followed by an immune response to one or more antigens in the enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) panel. The study was approved by the institutional review boards of the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, the University of Minnesota, and the respective clinical sites that participated in the original studies.

- **Throat cultures**: Throat swabs were obtained on enrollment, every 4 weeks thereafter, and when the subjects showed any signs or symptoms of pharyngitis. Swabs were sent to the University of Minnesota Streptococcal Reference Laboratory, where group A β-hemolytic streptococci were identified, grouped, and emm typed.

- **Serum samples**: Serum samples were obtained on enrollment and every 13 weeks from each study subject. In the intervals between scheduled collections, signs and symptoms of pharyngitis resulted in an additional serum collection.

### Contactin-1 autoimmunity: Serologic, neurologic, and pathologic correlates [^111BFfo3]. Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

- **Immunotherapy and clinical outcomes**: All except one patient (9/10) were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Other first-line therapies included plasmapheresis (4/9) and IV corticosteroids (2/9). Four of the nine patients who received IVIG as first-line immunotherapy improved, but three of those four relapsed within four weeks and became refractory to retreatment with IVIG. Among three patients with undetectable subtype anti-contactin IgG4 in our series, two received IVIG and one received plasmapheresis as first-line immunotherapy. None of these three cases had a sustained response to first-line therapy and experienced a relapsing or progressive course.

	- **Second-line treatments**: Six of the ten contactin-1 neuropathy cases received second-line immunosuppressive agents, which included rituximab (n = 2), mycophenolate mofetil (n = 2), cyclophosphamide (n = 1), and azathioprine (n = 1). Two patients stabilized (those treated with cyclophosphamide and azathioprine) and one patient infused with rituximab improved. At the last follow-up, five patients required a wheelchair for ambulation. The median follow-up period was 60 months (range, 4–180 months).

### American College of Rheumatology guidance statements for addressing mental health concerns in youth with pediatric rheumatologic diseases [^111HPym1]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Low credibility.

Collaborative management statements - **Delphi panel findings**: Delphi panel members reached consensus after two rounds of voting in all but one of the collaborative management guidance statements. Two of these statements comprised the 11 final guidance statements. These recommendations included that patients with moderate or severe symptoms need urgent assessment by a mental health specialist, and patients with mild symptoms should follow up with their primary physician for monitoring. Eight additional statements reached consensus, but with less empirical support, and are detailed in supplementary materials.

- **Clinic environment and education statements**: Delphi panel members reached consensus after two rounds of voting in all but two of the clinic environment and education statements. Two of these comprised the 11 guidance statements. One recommendation was that patients with a new PRD diagnosis should be offered resources (e.g. websites or peer support) to address common mental health concerns for youth with PRDs. Another recommendation was that ongoing discussions and education about mental health should align with the patient's developmental stage and sociocultural background. A summary of resources providers may wish to consider can be found in Table 3.

### Anti-SARS-CoV-2 and autoantibody profiles in the cerebrospinal fluid of 3 teenaged patients with COVID-19 and subacute neuropsychiatric symptoms [^113Ak83C]. JAMA Neurology (2021). High credibility.

More than 100 million people have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, including nearly 2 million children in the US. Although respiratory disease in pediatric COVID-19 is generally mild, parainfectious and postinfectious neurologic sequelae are increasingly recognized. These include encephalitis, seizures, aseptic meningitis, and confusion — found in about 20% of cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Notably, rates of new and reoccurring psychiatric illness are significantly increased in adults after SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with influenza and other respiratory infections.

SARS-CoV-2 RNA is rarely detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with COVID-19, but intrathecal anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibodies have been reported, suggesting possible neuroinvasion. Although some neurologically impaired adults with COVID-19 have intrathecal antineural autoantibodies, to our knowledge, neither intrathecal anti–SARS-CoV-2 nor antineural antibodies have been reported in pediatric patients with COVID-19 and neuropsychiatric presentations.

### Management of patients with neurological diseases considering post-pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) related risks and dangers - An updated European Academy of Neurology consensus statement [^116WLQSF]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). High credibility.

In the production of the updated statement, besides the COVID‐19 Task Force members, almost all Scientific and Core Panels of the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) were involved, thus ensuring that the recommendations reflect the experience and knowledge across various subspecialties of neurology.

With one exception, all the recommendations from the sections on the treatment of neurological conditions and on patients with chronic neurological conditions have stood the test of time, although requiring updates. Moreover, the updated and new statements, developed through the first round of Task Force discussions, received overall support from the wider community of the members of the managing groups of the EAN Scientific Panels (SPs) and Core Groups, with none of the proposed statements rejected in the survey.

Some items in this updated statement are almost unchanged from the 2020 statement due to their ongoing validity — for example, recommendation number 1 on the management of neurological conditions requiring intensive care unit admission. Some items required certain modifications and/or clarifications — for example, the recommendations on cell-depleting and immunosuppressive therapy, where the specification of drugs and drug types was made. The recommendation on the use of plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin (item 9) was the most controversial, with a relatively high rate of suggestions to remove it, but with even twice as high a rate of suggestions to keep it unchanged. Obviously, this is an area where more data are needed to permit forming an unambiguous opinion.

### Clinical practice guideline: Tonsillectomy in children (update) [^113RvRFF]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, specifically with respect to indications for tonsillectomy, the AAO-HNSF 2019 guidelines recommend evaluating pediatric patients with recurrent throat infections that do not meet criteria for tonsillectomy. Clinicians should consider modifying factors that may favor tonsillectomy, including, but not limited to:

- **Multiple antibiotic allergies/intolerance**: Consideration is advised in such cases.
- **Periodic fever with aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis syndrome**: These conditions may influence the decision.
- **History of more than one peritonsillar abscess**: This history is a significant factor in the evaluation.

### Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders and streptococcal infections: Role of otolaryngologist [^112egeoC]. The Laryngoscope (2001). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: To increase awareness and understanding of the putative role of streptococcal infection in the development of neuropsychiatric disorders in children and to discuss therapeutic options in this group of patients.

- **Methods**: Case illustration and literature review.

- **Results**: Two siblings, one with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and one with a tic disorder, underwent tonsillectomy for recurrent streptococcal pharyngitis. At the latest follow-up visit (11 months postoperatively), both patients exhibited significant improvement in their psychiatric illnesses. We discuss these cases as well as the diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS).

- **Conclusion**: PANDAS is an active area of research investigating the relationship between streptococcal infections and the development of obsessive-compulsive disorder or tic disorders (or both) in children. The etiopathogenesis of PANDAS is thought to reflect autoimmune mechanisms and involvement of the basal ganglia of susceptible hosts. Because otolaryngologists evaluate a large portion of pediatric patients with recurrent streptococcal pharyngitis, it is important to be aware of this association and to manage these patients appropriately.

### Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections - anesthetic implications and literature review [^111x3WTL]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2006). Low credibility.

Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) are rare neurobehavioral disorders in children. Affected children may present with a diverse array of perioperative manifestations, including compulsive behavior, agitation, and abnormal movements. The perioperative management might be more challenging for anesthesiologists.

A series of therapeutic plasmapheresis in these children may complicate their anesthesia management. We describe the first case of a patient with PANDAS and its anesthesia implications.

### Ofatumumab for the treatment of COVID-19-associated autoimmune encephalitis: A case report [^1177PJe8]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2025). Low credibility.

Autoimmune encephalitis is a rare but severe complication of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Typically, treatment involves immunomodulatory approaches such as steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), or plasma exchange, though for some patients, these treatments are not effective. Here, we report a case of COVID-19-associated encephalitis in a patient exhibiting cognitive impairment, epileptic seizures, tachycardia, and diaphoresis, with cranial MRI findings resembling those seen in limbic encephalitis. Initially, the patient had a suboptimal response to antiviral therapy, high-dose steroids, and IVIG treatment. Nevertheless, his clinical symptoms and cranial MRI abnormalities markedly improved following the administration of Ofatumumab. Administering Ofatumumab early in COVID-19-related autoimmune encephalitis may benefit patients more.

### Recommendations for diagnosis and management of autoimmune pancreatitis in childhood: Consensus from INSPPIRE [^111GtPMz]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for pediatric pancreatitis, particularly in patients with autoimmune pancreatitis, the 2018 INSPPIRE guidelines recommend considering a new course of prednisone in case of relapse. They suggest offering immunomodulators, such as 6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, or infliximab (for patients with a concomitant diagnosis of IBD), as an alternative to prednisone in patients with biopsy-proven pediatric autoimmune pancreatitis if maintenance therapy is required.

### Post-streptococcal autoimmune disorders of the central nervous system [^115BWYg1]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2005). High credibility.

Group A Streptococcus can induce autoimmune disease in humans, particularly affecting the heart, joints, and brain. Recently, the spectrum of post-streptococcal disease of the central nervous system (CNS) has broadened to include movement disorders (such as chorea, tics, dystonia, and Parkinsonism), psychiatric disorders (particularly emotional disorders), and associated sleep disorders. Neuroimaging and pathological studies indicate that the basal ganglia is the most vulnerable brain region.

The immunopathogenesis of the disease is incompletely defined. Although there is some support for autoantibody-mediated disease, several conflicting studies cast doubt on this hypothesis. It has been speculated that post-streptococcal autoimmunity has a role in common neuropsychiatric diseases, but the evidence is conflicting. Routine screening of patients with Tourette syndrome and obsessive-compulsive disorder for post-streptococcal autoimmune abnormalities is not recommended at present. However, post-streptococcal disorders of the CNS remain a useful model of neuropsychiatric disease and may improve our understanding of abnormal movements and behaviors in children.

### Ercp-related adverse events: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline [^114sas6r]. Endoscopy (2020). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, specifically for the prevention of pancreatitis, the ESGE 2020 guidelines recommend considering the use of a short 5-Fr pancreatic stent without an internal flange but with a flange or pigtail on the duodenal side. It is advised to assess the passage of the stent from the pancreatic duct within 5–10 days of placement and to remove any retained stents endoscopically.

### Antizol [^1175FSTw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2009). Low credibility.

If ethylene glycol or methanol poisoning is left untreated, it leads to the accumulation of toxic metabolites, such as glycolic and oxalic acids in ethylene glycol intoxication, and formic acid in methanol intoxication. These metabolites can induce metabolic acidosis, nausea, vomiting, seizures, stupor, coma, calcium oxaluria, acute tubular necrosis, blindness, and death. Diagnosing these poisonings may be difficult because ethylene glycol and methanol concentrations diminish in the blood as they are metabolized into their respective metabolites. Therefore, both ethylene glycol and methanol concentrations, along with acid-base balance — as determined by serum electrolyte (anion gap) and/or arterial blood gas analysis — should be frequently monitored and used to guide treatment.

Treatment involves blocking the formation of toxic metabolites using inhibitors of alcohol dehydrogenase, such as Antizol®, and correcting metabolic abnormalities. In patients with high ethylene glycol or methanol concentrations (≥ 50 mg/dL), significant metabolic acidosis, or renal failure, hemodialysis should be considered to remove ethylene glycol or methanol and the respective toxic metabolites of these alcohols.

Begin Antizol® treatment immediately upon suspicion of ethylene glycol or methanol ingestion based on patient history and/or anion gap metabolic acidosis, increased osmolar gap, visual disturbances, or oxalate crystals in the urine, or a documented serum ethylene glycol or methanol concentration.

### Pandas anorexia nervosa — endangered, extinct or nonexistent [^1159VhfV]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

Substantial evidence exists for the concept of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection (PANDAS), such as some cases of obsessive-compulsive disorder and tics/Tourette's syndrome. More recently, PANDAS-AN has been described. The aim of this article is to provide a critical review of this concept.

The literature was searched using Medline, Psychinfo, and Google. There is some evidence for the entity of PANDAS-AN, but this is considerably limited by a wide range of methodological problems, including the seemingly low prevalence, the lack of clarity in diagnostic criteria, and the lack of specificity in the diagnostic tests. Innovative treatment approaches hold promise but require further evaluation.

Further research into PANDAS-AN, using more clearly defined and consistent diagnostic criteria, is needed, given the potential for enhancing the understanding of the pathogenesis of AN and for more effective treatments.

### Streptococcal upper respiratory tract infections and exacerbations of tic and obsessive-compulsive symptoms: a prospective longitudinal study [^117BTviJ]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this blinded, prospective, longitudinal study was to determine whether new group A β hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) infections are temporally associated with exacerbations of tic or obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms in children who met published criteria for pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS). A group of children with Tourette syndrome and/or OC disorder without a PANDAS history served as the comparison (non-PANDAS) group.

Consecutive clinical ratings of tic and OC symptom severity were obtained for 31 PANDAS subjects and 53 non-PANDAS subjects. Clinical symptoms and laboratory values (throat cultures and streptococcal antibody titers) were evaluated at regular intervals during a 25-month period. Additional testing occurred at the time of any tic or OC symptom exacerbation. New GABHS infections were established by throat swab cultures and/or a recent significant rise in streptococcal antibodies. Laboratory personnel were blinded to case or control status and clinical conditions (exacerbation or not), and clinical evaluators were blinded to the laboratory results.

No group differences were observed in the number of clinical exacerbations or the number of newly diagnosed GABHS infections. On only six occasions out of a total of 51 (12%), a newly diagnosed GABHS infection was followed, within 2 months, by an exacerbation of tic and/or OC symptoms. In every instance, this association occurred in the non-PANDAS group. This study provides no evidence for a temporal association between new GABHS infections and tic or OC symptom exacerbations in children diagnosed with PANDAS.

### Panda: Prioritization of autism-genes using network-based deep-learning approach [^112FKBVr]. Genetic Epidemiology (2020). High credibility.

Understanding the genetic background of complex diseases and disorders plays an essential role in the promising field of precision medicine. The evaluation of candidate genes, however, requires time-consuming and expensive experiments given a large number of possibilities. Thus, computational methods have seen increasing applications in predicting gene-disease associations.

We proposed a bioinformatics framework, Prioritization of Autism-genes using Network-based Deep-learning Approach (PANDA). Our approach aims to identify autism-genes across the human genome based on patterns of gene-gene interactions and topological similarity of genes in the interaction network. PANDA trains a graph deep learning classifier using the input of the human molecular interaction network and predicts and ranks the probability of autism association of every node (gene) in the network. PANDA was able to achieve a high classification accuracy of 89%, outperforming three other commonly used machine learning algorithms. Moreover, the gene prioritization ranking list produced by PANDA was evaluated and validated using an independent large-scale exome-sequencing study. The top 10% of PANDA-ranked genes were found significantly enriched for autism association.

### Association between streptococcal infection and obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette's syndrome, and tic disorder [^113718SN]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Reports have suggested that streptococcal infection may be etiologically related to pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders (PANDAS), but there are few good epidemiologic studies to support this theory. Using population-based data from a large West-Coast health maintenance organization, this study assessed whether streptococcal infection was associated with an increased risk for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), Tourette's syndrome (TS), or tic disorder.

This is a case-control study of children aged 4 to 13 years receiving their first diagnosis of OCD, TS, or tic disorder between January 1992 and December 1999 at Group Health Cooperative outpatient facilities. Cases were matched to controls by birth date, gender, primary physician, and propensity to seek health care.

Patients with OCD, TS, or tic disorder were more likely than controls to have had prior streptococcal infection (OR: 2.22; 95% CI: 1.05, 4.69) in the 3 months before the onset date. The risk was higher among children with multiple streptococcal infections within 12 months (OR: 3.10; 95% CI: 1.77, 8.96). Having multiple infections with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus within a 12-month period was associated with an increased risk for TS (OR: 13.6; 95% CI: 1.93, 51.0). These associations did not change appreciably when limited to cases with a clear date of onset of symptoms or with tighter matching on health care behavior.

These findings lend epidemiologic evidence that PANDAS may arise as a result of a postinfectious autoimmune phenomenon induced by childhood streptococcal infection.

### Autoimmune encephalitis: Proposed best practice recommendations for diagnosis and acute management [^116BG1s5]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2021). High credibility.

Core authors from the Autoimmune Encephalitis Alliance Clinicians Network (AEACN) developed the first draft of this paper. The AEACN is comprised of self-identified clinicians with interest and clinical expertise in autoimmune encephalitis (AE) management, listed by the AE Alliance — a non-profit organization founded by AE patients and families to establish a supportive community for patients and caregivers, enhance clinical collaboration, and facilitate AE scientific research. The AEACN includes a multidisciplinary international group of adult and pediatric neurologists, rheumatologists, psychiatrists, neuropsychologists, and other specialists with real-life experience in AE management.

The authors of the first draft reviewed available literature to compile existing evidence for every step in AE management. Where evidence was lacking or controversial, an electronic survey was distributed to all AEACN members to solicit individual responses. The survey questions were strategically planned to examine initial treatment, continued care, and long-term management. After incorporating the survey results into the manuscript, the updated version was circulated to all participating AEACN members for edits and further suggestions.

### Anti-basal ganglia antibodies in PANDAS [^114FYgtT]. Movement Disorders (2004). Low credibility.

An autoimmune-mediated mechanism involving molecular mimicry has been proposed for a variety of pediatric movement disorders that occur following a streptococcal infection. In this study, anti-basal ganglia antibodies (ABGA) were measured in 15 children with the diagnosis of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infection (PANDAS) and compared with those in 15 controls. ELISA and Western immunoblotting (WB) methods were used to detect ABGA against supernatant (S1), pellet (P2), and synaptosomal preparations from adult postmortem caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus.

ELISA optical density values did not differ between PANDAS patients and controls across all preparations. Immunoblotting identified multiple bands in all subjects with no differences in the number of bands or their total density. Discriminant analysis, used to assess mean binding patterns, showed that PANDAS patients differed from controls only for the caudate S1 fraction (Wilks' lambda = 0.0236, P < 0.0002), with PANDAS-primarily tic subjects providing the greatest discrimination. Among the epitopes contributing to differences between PANDAS and controls in the caudate S1 fraction, mean binding to the epitope at 183 kDa was the most different between groups.

In conclusion, ELISA measurements do not differentiate between PANDAS and controls, suggesting a lack of major antibody changes in this disorder. Further immunoblot analyses using a caudate supernatant fraction are required to completely exclude the possibility of minor antibody repertoire differences in PANDAS subjects.

### Guillain-Barré syndrome in times of pandemics [^115mX9oB]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

In case of a sudden increase in patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), clinicians with limited expertise in GBS may need to manage these patients, and the availability of facilities and resources may run out. We expect limitations, mainly in ICU beds and rehabilitation care, as this was also reported during the Zika virus outbreak in Brazil. These limitations are especially important in low-resource countries that often have suboptimal or malfunctioning healthcare systems, a lack of health professionals, and are hot spots for outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases. Here, we provide recommendations on how to safeguard good quality diagnosis and management of GBS during a pandemic.

- **Guideline for management of GBS**: Diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of GBS can be complicated as patients may present with non-specific symptoms and vary with respect to clinical severity, treatment response, and outcome. Furthermore, there are several diseases that can be difficult to distinguish from GBS, such as critical illness neuropathy, which is now especially important as many patients are admitted to the ICU for extended periods due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Recently, a 10-step evidence-based consensus guideline for GBS was developed in response to the Zika virus outbreak. This guideline was designed to be compact and easy-to-use and applicable in all healthcare settings. An online version of the guideline is supported by The Global Health Network. Its use may help improve the management of GBS during an outbreak.

### The role of tonsillectomy in the treatment of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) [^117KtcEB]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) in children describe neuropsychiatric symptom exacerbations that relate temporally to streptococcal infections. Recent case reports suggest that tonsillectomy may effectively reduce these symptoms; however, no consensus treatment guidelines exist. This study examines whether tonsillectomy improves neuropsychiatric symptoms in children with PANDAS who have an incomplete response to antibiotic therapy.

- **Observations**: Ten patients met strict diagnostic criteria for PANDAS. Comparisons were made between parental reports of symptom severity at diagnosis, after antibiotic treatment (in 10 patients), and after tonsillectomy (in 9). From a baseline severity score of 10, antibiotics alone improved symptoms to a median (interquartile range [IQR]) score of 8 (6.5–10.0) (P = 0.03). Nine children who subsequently underwent tonsillectomy reported symptom improvement in comparison with treatment with antibiotics alone, including those with no response to antibiotics. Symptom severity improved at all periods after tonsillectomy compared with antibiotics alone. The median score [IQR] 3 months postoperatively was 3 (0.0–6.5) (P = 0.01); 6 months postoperatively, 3 (0.0–5.0) (P = 0.02); 1 year postoperatively, 3 (0.0–5.0) (P = 0.02); and 3 years postoperatively, 0.5 (0.0–2.3) (P = 0.03). Four of the 9 had complete resolution after tonsillectomy.

- **Conclusions and relevance**: This PANDAS cohort whose neuropsychiatric symptoms did not respond sufficiently to antibiotics may have gained benefit from tonsillectomy.

### Autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection: Sydenham chorea, PANDAS, and PANDAS variants [^116W3s2E]. Journal of Child Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Streptococcal infection in children is usually benign and self-limited. In a small percentage of children, prominent neurologic and/or psychiatric sequelae can occur. Sydenham chorea is the best defined and best recognized. PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection) is a well-defined syndrome in which tics (motor and/or vocal) and/or obsessive-compulsive disorder consistently exacerbate in temporal correlation to a group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection. PANDAS constitutes a subset of children with tics, Tourette syndrome, and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

In addition to strictly defined PANDAS, we and others have recognized several PANDAS variants, including adult-onset variant, a dystonic variant, a myoclonic variant, and a "chronic" PANDAS variant. The nosology and classification of these entities are rapidly evolving. The recognition that some pediatric neurobehavioral syndromes have infectious and/or immunologic triggers points to important new avenues of disease treatment. In this review, we summarize this complex and rapidly evolving area of clinical research.

### Clinical factors associated with pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections [^114iFBZ9]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to explore associated clinical factors in children with pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS).

- **Study design**: Children with tics, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or both (n = 109) were examined with personal and family history, diagnostic interviews, physical examination, medical record review, and measurement of baseline levels of streptococcal antibodies.

- **Results**: Significant group differences were found. Children with PANDAS, as opposed to those without, were more likely to experience dramatic onset, definite remissions, remission of neuropsychiatric symptoms during antibiotic therapy, a history of tonsillectomies/adenoidectomies, evidence of group A streptococcal infection, and clumsiness.

- **Conclusion**: The identification of clinical features associated with PANDAS should assist in delineating risks for this subtype of obsessive-compulsive disorder/tics.

### Tonsillectomies and adenoidectomies do not prevent the onset of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with group A streptococcus [^1178kcBE]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2013). Low credibility.

In children presenting with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and/or tics, especially those with a temporal association with streptococcal pharyngitis (e.g. Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcus), there is speculation about whether tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy might improve the child's neuropsychiatric course. Our objective was to examine whether the removal of the tonsils and/or adenoids impacted streptococcal antibody titers, the timing of onset of OCD and/or tics, and the clinical severity of these symptoms.

- **Methods**: Study participants (N = 112; average age = 9.2 ± 2.4; 44 women) were recruited as part of a prospective investigation of neuropsychiatric phenomena with temporal association to streptococcal pharyngitis. They were examined by family history, diagnostic interview, physical examination, medical record review, psychological testing, and streptococcal antibodies. Participants were divided into surgical or non-surgical groups. The surgical group consisted of children having previously had a tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy (n = 32), while the remaining children were categorized as the non-surgical group (n = 76). Measures of OCD and tic severity, streptococcal antibody titers, and Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcus classification were compared between both groups.

- **Results**: There were no significant differences, as determined by streptococcal antibody titers, Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcus classification, and OCD or tic severity between the surgical and non-surgical groups.

### Pans and pandas - symptoms beyond OCD and tics - a systematic review [^111d9MxY]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2025). Low credibility.

This article aims to describe the symptomatology of Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections (PANDAS) and Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (PANS), and to highlight some of their potential distinctive features by juxtaposing available data with existing literature on pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

Given the scarcity of high-quality studies, we decided to review a wide range of publications on the clinical presentation of PANS and PANDAS, including case series and case reports, regardless of their methodological heterogeneity. Although PANS and PANDAS share many characteristics with non-PANS/PANDAS OCD, the acute onset of obsessive-compulsive symptoms in conjunction with concomitant features, especially separation anxiety, irritability, emotional lability, or dysgraphia, should prompt consideration of a possible post-infectious etiology. Further research aimed at creating more precise diagnostic tools is needed to facilitate differential diagnosis.

### Streptococcal infections and exacerbations in PANDAS: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111erJcg]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2019). Low credibility.

The pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection (PANDAS) hypothesis suggests an association between group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) infections and subsequent onset or exacerbation of neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder or tic disorders.

- **Methods**: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis including longitudinal, prospective studies on exacerbations of neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with GABHS infections in children with PANDAS. We searched PubMed and EMBASE through August 14, 2017. Two independent reviewers extracted data, and we used random-effects analysis to calculate rate ratios (RR).

- **Results**: Three studies were included with a total of 82 PANDAS cases and 127 control children with obsessive-compulsive disorder or chronic tic disorder. PANDAS cases had a nonsignificantly increased RR of 2.33 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.63–8.70, P = 0.21, I = 28.3%] for exacerbations of neuropsychiatric symptoms in temporal proximity to a GABHS infection and no increased risk of GABHS infections (RR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.56–1.73, P = 0.97, I = 45%) compared with the control children. However, PANDAS cases had an increased risk of neuropsychiatric exacerbations in general, with an RR of 1.54 (95% CI: 1.12–2.11, P = 0.008, I = 0%) compared with the control children. The studies had methodologic heterogeneity, high risk of selection bias, and differed concerning case definition and infection measures.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings did not show significant evidence concerning higher rates of exacerbations.
