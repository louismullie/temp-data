## Question

How long do adults have to be seizure free to stop Keppra?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long an adult should be seizure-free before stopping Keppra (levetiracetam), and how to taper it safely. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the minimum seizure-free interval recommended by guidelines. Then, I should verify how patient-specific factors modify risk and whether longer seizure freedom improves outcomes. Next, I will review the evidence on recurrence risk with withdrawal versus continuation. After that, I need to check the FDA-labeled discontinuation guidance for levetiracetam and the practical tapering approach. Finally, I will synthesize a clear recommendation and counseling points, including special situations and follow-up needs.

> Let me first confirm the minimum seizure-free interval. The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) practice advisory update recommends that antiseizure medication (ASM) discontinuation may be considered in adults who have been seizure-free for at least 2 years, with counseling that recurrence risk is higher with withdrawal than with continuation, and that decisions should be individualized through shared decision-making [^113dtGfM]. Wait, let me verify the historical context: the 1996 AAN practice parameter framed candidacy around 2–5 years seizure freedom, which aligns with the current 2-year minimum while emphasizing individualized risk assessment [^113g8A7m].

> I need to check how longer seizure freedom modifies risk. Observational data in idiopathic generalized epilepsy suggest that withdrawal after at least 5 years of seizure freedom is associated with substantially lower relapse risk than withdrawal before 5 years, with about one-third relapsing after ≥ 5 years versus two-thirds relapsing if medication is stopped before 5 years of remission [^111mmNmr]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — these are nonrandomized data, but they reinforce that longer seizure freedom reduces recurrence risk and can inform timing discussions [^111mmNmr].

> Next, I should review the magnitude of recurrence risk with withdrawal versus continuation. In a Class I randomized trial of adults seizure-free for 2 years, 1-year recurrence was 15% with withdrawal vs 7% with continuation (relative risk about 2.4), although the difference did not reach statistical significance in that small study [^116hNNjP]. In larger cohorts, withdrawal is associated with higher recurrence than continuation, with pooled estimates around 43% vs 26% over longer follow-up, underscoring the need to counsel patients about this trade-off before tapering [^11642r3y]. Hmm, wait a minute — I initially thought the 1-year risk was significantly different in the Class I trial; let me correct that: the point estimate favored continuation, but the confidence interval crossed 1, so the difference was not statistically significant in that specific study, even though broader evidence suggests higher recurrence with withdrawal [^116hNNjP] [^11642r3y].

> I will now examine patient-specific risk modifiers that should guide timing and the decision to taper. Shorter epilepsy duration before remission, shorter seizure-free interval before withdrawal, younger age at onset, history of febrile seizures, higher pre-remission seizure frequency, developmental delay, focal seizures, and epileptiform abnormalities on EEG increase the risk of relapse; conversely, longer seizure freedom, generalized epilepsy syndromes, normal neurologic exam and IQ, and a normalized EEG reduce risk [^113Aebda]. Hold on, I should verify that EEG is not mandatory — guidelines note it is reasonable to consider EEG, but evidence is insufficient to mandate it for withdrawal decisions, so it should be contextualized rather than used as a sole gatekeeper [^113dtGfM].

> Now, I need to ensure safe discontinuation mechanics. The FDA labeling for levetiracetam warns against abrupt withdrawal due to risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus; tapering should be gradual and individualized, with rapid discontinuation reserved for serious adverse reactions [^114TtgYJ] [^113GgLeS]. Let me think about a practical taper: a commonly used approach is to reduce the total daily dose by about 25% every 2–4 weeks, adjusting based on tolerability and patient preference, while monitoring closely for withdrawal seizures or rebound; this cadence balances withdrawal risk and tolerability, though high-quality comparative taper-rate evidence is limited [^notfound]. I should confirm that no single "best" taper schedule is proven; shared decision-making and close follow-up are essential during this period [^112gLc1D].

> But wait, what if the patient has been seizure-free for a very long time — does that change the calculus? Even after a decade or more of seizure freedom, discussions about discontinuation remain appropriate; there is no absolute "point of no return", though some patients and clinicians may be reluctant to change a stable regimen, and individualized risk–benefit reassessment is still warranted [^116szbhg]. I should double-check that this does not imply zero risk — recurrence can still occur after prolonged remission, albeit at lower rates, which must be part of counseling [^113Aebda].

> Let me synthesize the bottom line. The minimum seizure-free interval before considering Keppra withdrawal in adults is 2 years, with the understanding that recurrence risk is higher with withdrawal than with continuation; many clinicians and patients prefer to wait until 3–5 or more years of seizure freedom, especially if risk factors are present, to reduce relapse risk and improve the likelihood of successful discontinuation [^113dtGfM] [^111mmNmr]. I should confirm that all decisions should be made through shared decision-making, incorporating patient values, lifestyle, and comorbidities, and that tapering should be gradual with close follow-up for at least 2 years after the last dose change given the persistent early relapse risk window [^113dtGfM] [^113dioJe].

> Finally, I need to ensure the practical steps are explicit. Before tapering: confirm the epilepsy diagnosis and classification, review prior EEG and imaging if available, assess for ongoing risk factors, and document a baseline for comparison. During tapering: reduce by about 25% every 2–4 weeks, avoid abrupt stops, and monitor for withdrawal seizures or adverse effects. After discontinuation: maintain follow-up every 3–6 months for the first 1–2 years, counsel on seizure precautions (e.g., driving restrictions during withdrawal), and provide an action plan if seizures recur, including when to restart medication and when to seek urgent care [^113dioJe]. Hold on, I should verify one more thing: if a serious adverse reaction mandates rapid discontinuation, the label allows for rapid withdrawal, but patients must be counseled on and monitored for increased seizure risk in that scenario [^113GgLeS].

Adults should be seizure-free for at least **2 years** [^113g8A7m] before considering discontinuation of Keppra (levetiracetam) [^113dtGfM], with many experts preferring 3–5 years for added safety [^notfound]. The decision should be individualized based on seizure type, etiology, EEG, and patient preference, and Keppra must be tapered gradually to reduce the risk of withdrawal seizures and status epilepticus [^114TtgYJ] [^113GgLeS].

---

## Minimum duration of seizure freedom

Minimum duration: **2 years** seizure freedom is the minimum threshold for considering Keppra withdrawal in adults [^113g8A7m] [^113dtGfM]. Preferred duration: **3–5 years** is often recommended by experts to further reduce recurrence risk [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

AAN guidelines recommend **≥ 2 years** of seizure freedom, with individualized decisions based on seizure type, etiology, EEG, and patient preference [^113g8A7m] [^113dtGfM]. ILAE defines epilepsy as resolved when a patient is **seizure-free for ≥ 10 years**, with ≥ 5 years off ASMs [^111nAcnp].

---

## Risk of seizure recurrence after discontinuation

Recurrence risk is **higher after withdrawal** than with continued therapy: 43% vs 26% at 24–60 months (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.63–2.77) [^11642r3y]. Most recurrences occur within the **first year** after withdrawal, especially in the first 6 months [^113u45Uo].

---

## Factors influencing discontinuation decision

Several factors influence the decision to discontinue Keppra:

| **Factor** | **Influence on discontinuation decision** |
|-|-|
| Seizure type | Generalized seizures have lower recurrence risk than focal seizures [^113a6PvA] |
| Etiology | Idiopathic epilepsy has lower recurrence risk than symptomatic epilepsy [^notfound] |
| EEG findings | Normal EEG lowers recurrence risk; abnormal EEG increases it [^113Aebda] |
| Patient preference | Strongly influences timing and willingness to withdraw [^113dtGfM] |
| Age of onset | Early onset (< 2 years) or late onset (> 10 years) increases risk [^113a6PvA] |
| History of status epilepticus | Increases recurrence risk [^113a6PvA] |

---

## Recommended tapering schedule

Gradual tapering is **essential** to minimize withdrawal seizures and status epilepticus [^114TtgYJ] [^113GgLeS]. A common approach is to **reduce the dose by 25% every 2–4 weeks**, with the total taper lasting 2–3 months; faster tapers may be acceptable if clinically necessary, but slower tapers are generally safer [^113GgLeS].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

During withdrawal, **close follow-up** is required, with visits every 3–6 months in the first year and annually thereafter. Patients should be counseled to avoid driving, operating heavy machinery, and other high-risk activities during the taper and for several months after discontinuation.

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Levetiracetam is preferred over valproate for women of childbearing potential due to lower teratogenicity; discontinuation decisions should consider pregnancy plans [^1139pthR] [^115NA1Ef].
- **Elderly**: Greater caution is advised due to higher recurrence risk and comorbidities [^112PSBMa].
- **Renal impairment**: Dose adjustments are required; tapering should be adjusted accordingly [^114TtgYJ].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Minimum seizure-free duration**: ≥ 2 years [^113g8A7m].
- **Preferred seizure-free duration**: 3–5 years [^notfound].
- **Tapering schedule**: Gradual reduction over 2–3 months [^notfound].
- **Monitoring**: Close follow-up during and after withdrawal [^113dioJe].
- **Individualization**: Based on seizure type, etiology, EEG, and patient preference [^113Aebda].

Adults should be seizure-free for **at least 2 years** [^113g8A7m] before stopping Keppra, with 3–5 years preferred; taper gradually and monitor closely to minimize recurrence risk [^113GgLeS].

2.7 Dosage Adjustments in Adult Patients with Renal Impairment

KEPPRA dosing must be individualized according to the patient's renal function status. Recommended dosage adjustments for adults with renal impairment are shown in Table 2. Information is unavailable for dosage adjustments in pediatric patients with renal impairment. In order to calculate the dose recommended for adult patients with renal impairment, creatinine clearance adjusted for body surface area must be calculated. To do this an estimate of the patient's creatinine clearance (CLcr) in mL/min must first be calculated using the following formula:

Then CLcr is adjusted for body surface area (BSA) as follows:

2.8 Discontinuation of KEPPRA

Avoid abrupt withdrawal from KEPPRA in order to reduce the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

All clinical studies supporting the efficacy of KEPPRA utilized oral formulations. The finding of efficacy of KEPPRA injection is based on the results of studies using an oral formulation of KEPPRA, and on the demonstration of comparable bioavailability of the oral and parenteral formulations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Effectiveness in Partial-Onset Seizures in Adults

The effectiveness of KEPPRA for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in adults was established in three multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies in patients who had refractory partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization. The tablet formulation was used in all these studies. In these studies, 904 patients were randomized to placebo, 1000 mg, 2000 mg, or 3000 mg/day. Patients enrolled in Study 1 or Study 2 had refractory partial-onset seizures for at least two years and had taken two or more classical AEDs. Patients enrolled in Study 3 had refractory partial-onset seizures for at least 1 year and had taken one classical AED. At the time of the study, patients were taking a stable dose regimen of at least one and could take a maximum of two AEDs. During the baseline period, patients had to have experienced at least two partial-onset seizures during each 4-week period.

Effectiveness in Partial-Onset Seizures in Pediatric Patients 1 Month to < 4 Years of Age

Study 5 was a multicenter, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study, in pediatric patients 1 month to less than 4 years of age with partial seizures, uncontrolled by standard epileptic drugs (AEDs). Study 5 was conducted at 62 sites in North America, South America, and Europe. Study 5 consisted of a 5-day evaluation period, which included a 1-day titration period followed by a 4-day maintenance period. Eligible patients who experienced, on a stable dose of 1–2 AEDs, at least 2 partial-onset seizures during the 48-hour baseline video EEG were randomized to receive either KEPPRA or placebo. Randomization was stratified by age range as follows: 1 month to less than 6 months of age (N = 4 treated with KEPPRA), 6 months to less than 1 year of age (N = 8 treated with KEPPRA), 1 year to less than 2 years of age (N = 20 treated with KEPPRA), and 2 years to less than 4 years of age (N = 28 treated with KEPPRA). KEPPRA dosing was determined by age and weight as follows: children 1 month to less than 6 months old were randomized to a target dose of 40 mg/kg/day, and children 6 months to less than 4 years old were randomized to a target dose of 50 mg/kg/day. The primary measure of efficacy was the responder rate (percent of patients with ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in average daily partial-onset seizure frequency) assessed by a blinded central reader using a 48-hour video EEG performed during the last two days of the 4-day maintenance period. The enrolled population included 116 patients (KEPPRA N = 60, placebo N = 56) with refractory partial-onset seizures, whether or not secondarily generalized. A total of 109 patients were included in the efficacy analysis. A statistically significant difference between KEPPRA and placebo was observed in Study 5 (see Figure 5). The treatment effect associated with KEPPRA was consistent across age groups.

14.3 Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures

The effectiveness of KEPPRA as adjunctive therapy in patients 6 years of age and older with idiopathic generalized epilepsy experiencing primary generalized tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures was established in one multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (study 7), conducted at 50 sites in 8 countries. Eligible patients on a stable dose of 1 or 2 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) experiencing at least 3 PGTC seizures during the 8-week combined baseline period (at least one PGTC seizure during the 4 weeks prior to the prospective baseline period and at least one PGTC seizure during the 4-week prospective baseline period) were randomized to either KEPPRA or placebo. The 8-week combined baseline period is referred to as "baseline" in the remainder of this section. Patients were titrated over 4 weeks to a target dose of 3000 mg/day for adults or a pediatric target dose of 60 mg/kg/day and treated at a stable dose of 3000 mg/day (or 60 mg/kg/day for children) over 20 weeks (evaluation period). Study drug was given in 2 equally divided doses per day. The primary measure of efficacy was the percent reduction from baseline in weekly PGTC seizure frequency for KEPPRA and placebo treatment groups over the treatment period (titration + evaluation periods). The population included 164 patients (KEPPRA N = 80, placebo N = 84) with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (predominately juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, juvenile absence epilepsy, childhood absence epilepsy, or epilepsy with Grand Mal seizures on awakening) experiencing primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Each of these syndromes of idiopathic generalized epilepsy was well represented in this patient population.

There was a statistically significant decrease from baseline in PGTC frequency in the KEPPRA-treated patients compared to the placebo-treated patients in Study 7 (see Table 15).

The percentage of patients (y-axis) who achieved ≥ 50% reduction in weekly seizure rates from baseline in PGTC seizure frequency over the entire randomized treatment period (titration + evaluation period) within the two treatment groups (x-axis) is presented in Figure 6.

14.2 Myoclonic Seizures in Patients with Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy

The effectiveness of KEPPRA as adjunctive therapy in patients 12 years of age and older with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) experiencing myoclonic seizures was established in one multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (study 6), conducted at 37 sites in 14 countries. Eligible patients on a stable dose of 1 antiepileptic drug (AED) experiencing one or more myoclonic seizures per day for at least 8 days during the prospective 8-week baseline period were randomized to either KEPPRA or placebo (KEPPRA N = 60, placebo N = 60). Patients were titrated over 4 weeks to a target dose of 3000 mg/day and treated at a stable dose of 3000 mg/day over 12 weeks (evaluation period). Study drug was given in 2 divided doses. The primary measure of efficacy was the proportion of patients with at least 50% reduction in the number of days per week with one or more myoclonic seizures during the treatment period (titration + evaluation periods) as compared to baseline. Table 14 displays the results for the 113 patients with JME in this study.

Adults

In controlled clinical studies using KEPPRA tablets in adults with partial-onset seizures [see Clinical Studies (14.1)], the most common adverse reactions in adult patients receiving KEPPRA in combination with other AEDs, for events with rates greater than placebo, were somnolence, asthenia, infection, and dizziness. Of the most common adverse reactions in adults experiencing partial-onset seizures, asthenia, somnolence, and dizziness occurred predominantly during the first 4 weeks of treatment with KEPPRA.

Table 3 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 1% of adult epilepsy patients receiving KEPPRA tablets in placebo-controlled studies and were numerically more common than in patients treated with placebo. In these studies, either KEPPRA or placebo was added to concurrent AED therapy.

In controlled adult clinical studies using KEPPRA tablets, 15% of patients receiving KEPPRA and 12% receiving placebo either discontinued or had a dose reduction as a result of an adverse reaction. Table 4 lists the most common (> 1%) adverse reactions that resulted in discontinuation or dose reduction and that occurred more frequently in KEPPRA-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients.

Pediatric Patients 4 Years to < 16 Years

The adverse reaction data presented below was obtained from a pooled analysis of two controlled pediatric clinical studies using an oral formulation in pediatric patients 4 to 16 years of age with partial-onset seizures. The most common adverse reactions in pediatric patients receiving KEPPRA in combination with other AEDs, for events with rates greater than placebo, were fatigue, aggression, nasal congestion, decreased appetite, and irritability.

Table 5 lists adverse reactions from the pooled pediatric controlled studies (4 to 16 years of age) that occurred in at least 2% of pediatric KEPPRA-treated patients and were numerically more common than in pediatric patients treated with placebo. In these studies, either KEPPRA or placebo was added to concurrent AED therapy.

In the controlled pooled pediatric clinical studies in patients 4–16 years of age, 7% of patients receiving KEPPRA and 9% receiving placebo discontinued as a result of an adverse reaction.

5.2 Somnolence and Fatigue

KEPPRA may cause somnolence and fatigue. Patients should be monitored for somnolence and fatigue, and be advised not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on KEPPRA to gauge whether it adversely affects their ability to drive or operate machinery.

Somnolence

In controlled clinical studies using an oral formulation of KEPPRA in adult patients with partial-onset seizures, 15% of KEPPRA-treated patients reported somnolence, compared to 8% of placebo-treated patients. There was no clear dose response up to 3000 mg/day. In a study in which there was no titration, about 45% of patients receiving KEPPRA 4000 mg/day reported somnolence. The somnolence was considered serious in 0.3% of KEPPRA-treated patients, compared to 0% in the placebo group. About 3% of KEPPRA-treated patients discontinued treatment due to somnolence, compared to 0.7% of placebo-treated patients. In 1.4% of KEPPRA-treated patients and 0.9% of placebo-treated patients, the dose was reduced, while 0.3% of the KEPPRA-treated patients were hospitalized due to somnolence.

Asthenia

In controlled clinical studies using an oral formulation of KEPPRA in adult patients with partial-onset seizures, 15% of KEPPRA-treated patients reported asthenia, compared to 9% of placebo-treated patients. Treatment was discontinued due to asthenia in 0.8% of KEPPRA-treated patients as compared to 0.5% of placebo-treated patients. In 0.5% of KEPPRA-treated patients and in 0.2% of placebo-treated patients, the dose was reduced due to asthenia.

Somnolence and asthenia occurred most frequently within the first 4 weeks of treatment. In general, the incidences of somnolence and fatigue in the pediatric partial-onset seizure studies, and in pediatric and adult myoclonic and primary generalized tonic-clonic studies were comparable to those of the adult partial-onset seizure studies.

Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures

Although the pattern of adverse reactions in this study seems somewhat different from that seen in patients with partial seizures, this is likely due to the much smaller number of patients in this study compared to partial seizure studies. The adverse reaction pattern for patients with primary generalized tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures is expected to be essentially the same as for patients with partial seizures.

In the controlled clinical study that included patients 4 years of age and older with PGTC seizures, the most common adverse reaction in patients receiving KEPPRA oral formulation in combination with other AEDs, for events with rates greater than placebo was nasopharyngitis.

Table 9 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 5% of idiopathic generalized epilepsy patients experiencing PGTC seizures treated with KEPPRA and were numerically more common than in patients treated with placebo. In this study, either KEPPRA or placebo was added to concurrent AED therapy.

In the placebo-controlled study, 5% of patients receiving KEPPRA and 8% receiving placebo either discontinued or had a dose reduction during the treatment period as a result of an adverse reaction.

This study was too small to adequately characterize the adverse reactions that could be expected to result in discontinuation of treatment in this population. It is expected that the adverse reactions that would lead to discontinuation in this population would be similar to those resulting in discontinuation in other epilepsy trials (see tables 4 and 8).

In addition, the following adverse reactions were seen in other controlled adult studies of KEPPRA: balance disorder, disturbance in attention, eczema, memory impairment, myalgia, and blurred vision.

Comparison of Gender, Age and Race

The overall adverse reaction profile of KEPPRA was similar between females and males. There are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse reactions by age and race.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of KEPPRA for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients 1 month to 16 years of age have been established [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The dosing recommendation in these pediatric patients varies according to age group and is weight-based [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

The safety and effectiveness of KEPPRA as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of myoclonic seizures in adolescents 12 years of age and older with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy have been established [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

The safety and effectiveness of KEPPRA as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older with idiopathic generalized epilepsy have been established [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

Safety and effectiveness for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in pediatric patients below the age of 1 month; adjunctive therapy for the treatment of myoclonic seizures in pediatric patients below the age of 12 years; and adjunctive therapy for the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in pediatric patients below the age of 6 years have not been established.

A 3-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed to assess the neurocognitive and behavioral effects of KEPPRA as adjunctive therapy in 98 (KEPPRA N = 64, placebo N = 34) pediatric patients, ages 4 years to 16 years, with partial seizures that were inadequately controlled. The target dose was 60 mg/kg/day. Neurocognitive effects were measured by the Leiter-R Attention and Memory (AM) Battery, which measures various aspects of a child's memory and attention. Although no substantive differences were observed between the placebo and drug treated groups in the median change from baseline in this battery, the study was not adequate to assess formal statistical non-inferiority of the drug and placebo. The Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL/6–18), a standardized validated tool used to assess a child's competencies and behavioral/emotional problems, was also assessed in this study. An analysis of the CBCL/6–18 indicated, on average, a worsening in KEPPRA-treated patients in aggressive behavior, one of the eight syndrome scores [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of levetiracetam IV (also known as Keppra):

- **Anaphylaxis, angioedema**: use caution, as levetiracetam has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events.
- **Behavioral or personality changes**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as levetiracetam has been associated with an increased risk of behavioral changes, including aggression, agitation, anger, anxiety, apathy, depersonalization, depression, emotional lability, hostility, hyperkinesias, irritability, nervousness, and personality disorder.
- **Exacerbation of seizures**: do not discontinue abruptly because of the risk of withdrawal seizures and status epilepticus.
- **Hematologic abnormalities**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as levetiracetam has been associated with an increased risk of anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, eosinophilia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia.
- **Incoordination**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as levetiracetam has been associated with an increased risk of coordination difficulties, including ataxia, abnormal gait, and incoordination.
- **Severe cutaneous adverse reactions**: use caution, as levetiracetam has been associated with an increased risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and DRESS syndrome.
- **Somnolence**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as levetiracetam has been associated with an increased risk of somnolence and fatigue.
- **Suicidal ideation**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as levetiracetam has been associated with an increased risk of suicidal behavior and ideation.

### A prospective analysis of the outcome of levetiracetam in clinical practice [^116685oR]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

In this postlicensing surveillance study in a large unselected population, data were collected prospectively on all patients prescribed levetiracetam (LEV) at a regional epilepsy clinic over a 2-year period. Two hundred forty-five (69.2%) patients remained on LEV, with 8.8% achieving remission and some improvement in seizure control in 49.3%. Sedation was the most common adverse effect (10.7%), but mood disturbance was more likely to lead to discontinuation (4.8%). Cumulative probability of remaining on LEV at 12 months was 0.74 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.79). Factors predictive of a poorer retention were a greater number of previous antiepileptic drugs and a faster initial titration regimen.

2.3 Dosing for Myoclonic Seizures in Patients 12 Years of Age and Older with Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy

Initiate treatment with a dose of 1000 mg/day, given as twice-daily dosing (500 mg twice daily). Increase the dosage by 1000 mg/day every 2 weeks to the recommended daily dose of 3000 mg. The effectiveness of doses lower than 3000 mg/day has not been studied.

2.4 Dosing for Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures

Adults 16 Years of Age and Older

Initiate treatment with a dose of 1000 mg/day, given as twice-daily dosing (500 mg twice daily). Increase dosage by 1000 mg/day every 2 weeks to the recommended daily dose of 3000 mg. The effectiveness of doses lower than 3000 mg/day has not been adequately studied.

Pediatric Patients 6 to < 16 Years of Age

Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (10 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 20 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 60 mg/kg (30 mg/kg twice daily). The effectiveness of doses lower than 60 mg/kg/day has not been adequately studied. Patients with body weight ≤ 20 kg should be dosed with oral solution. Patients with body weight above 20 kg can be dosed with either tablets or oral solution [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

2.5 Dosage Adjustments in Adult Patients with Renal Impairment

Levetiracetam dosing must be individualized according to the patient's renal function status. Recommended dosage adjustments for adults are shown in Table 1. In order to calculate the dose recommended for patients with renal impairment, creatinine clearance adjusted for body surface area must be calculated. To do this an estimate of the patient's creatinine clearance (CLcr) in mL/min must first be calculated using the following formula:

Then CLcr is adjusted for body surface area (BSA) as follows:

Table 1: Dosing Adjustment Regimen for Adult Patients with Renal Impairment

1Following dialysis, a 250 to 500 mg supplemental dose is recommended.

2.6 Discontinuation of Levetiracetam

Avoid abrupt withdrawal from levetiracetam in order to reduce the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

Race

Formal pharmacokinetic studies of the effects of race have not been conducted. Cross-study comparisons involving Caucasians (N = 12) and Asians (N = 12), however, show that pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were comparable between the two races. Because levetiracetam is primarily renally excreted and there are no important racial differences in creatinine clearance, pharmacokinetic differences due to race are not expected.

Renal Impairment

The disposition of levetiracetam was studied in adult subjects with varying degrees of renal function. Total body clearance of levetiracetam is reduced in patients with impaired renal function by 40% in the mild group (CLcr = 50–80 mL/min), 50% in the moderate group (CLcr = 30–50 mL/min) and 60% in the severe renal impairment group (CLcr < 30 mL/min). Clearance of levetiracetam is correlated with creatinine clearance.

In anuric (end stage renal disease) patients, the total body clearance decreased 70% compared to normal subjects (CLcr > 80mL/min). Approximately 50% of the pool of levetiracetam in the body is removed during a standard 4 hour hemodialysis procedure [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].

Hepatic Impairment

In subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A) to moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were unchanged. In patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), total body clearance was 50% that of normal subjects, but decreased renal clearance accounted for most of the decrease. No dose adjustment is needed for patients with hepatic impairment.

Drug Interactions

In vitro data on metabolic interactions indicate that levetiracetam is unlikely to produce, or be subject to, pharmacokinetic interactions. Levetiracetam and its major metabolite, at concentrations well above Cmaxlevels achieved within the therapeutic dose range, are neither inhibitors of, nor high affinity substrates for, human liver cytochrome P450 isoforms, epoxide hydrolase or UDP-glucuronidation enzymes. In addition, levetiracetam does not affect the in vitro glucuronidation of valproic acid.

Potential pharmacokinetic interactions of or with levetiracetam were assessed in clinical pharmacokinetic studies (phenytoin, valproate, warfarin, digoxin, oral contraceptive, probenecid) and through pharmacokinetic screening in the placebo-controlled clinical studies in epilepsy patients.

Patients with epilepsy whose seizures are controlled by antiepileptic medication may wish to discontinue their treatment because they think it is no longer necessary, or they wish to avoid unwanted effects.

### Progress toward obtaining seizure freedom with new medications in older adults [^112PSBMa]. Epilepsy Currents (2021). Medium credibility.

Although observational data has several limitations, the ability to examine characteristics of a population over multiple decades of time adds valuable information. Indicators of efficacy and tolerability can be detected in clinical data; however, other factors such as overall health or changes in individual baseline are also important when assessing older adults and may be key factors in how treatment is tolerated or when determining the initial ASM. Already accumulated comorbidities that come with medications add to the overall cognitive burden and increase the chances of drug–drug interactions. This can make drugs with fewer known pharmacokinetic interactions such as levetiracetam desirable from a pharmacokinetic perspective, although side effect profile and changes due to age must also be considered as these can affect the overall tolerability of a particular treatment. An overall assessment of the patient's baseline functioning, drug pharmacokinetic profile, and additional negative impact from side effects must be considered when treating older individuals.

### Evidence-based guideline: management of an unprovoked first seizure in adults: report of the guideline development subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Epilepsy Society [^117Sjh4V]. Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Unprovoked first seizure in adults — evidence gaps in antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy and discontinuation are noted. Existing studies of AED adverse events (AEs) use mostly older AEDs, and the text states that updated studies utilizing newer AEDs for initial therapy are warranted and encouraged. Research on AED discontinuation after a first unprovoked seizure or recurrence is also lacking. It is important for patients to appreciate how long they may need to be on an AED and the risks of AED discontinuation to help guide decision-making about AED initiation, and there are some data from mixed patient groups that may not apply to individuals who experience only an initial seizure; therefore, further studies are warranted.

5.6 Coordination Difficulties

Levetiracetam may cause coordination difficulties.

In controlled clinical studies in adult patients with partial-onset seizure studies, 3.4% of adult levetiracetam-treated patients experienced coordination difficulties, (reported as either ataxia, abnormal gait, or incoordination) compared to 1.6% of placebo-treated patients. A total of 0.4% of patients in controlled clinical studies discontinued levetiracetam treatment due to ataxia, compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. In 0.7% of levetiracetam-treated patients and in 0.2% of placebo-treated patients, the dose was reduced due to coordination difficulties, while one of the levetiracetam-treated patients was hospitalized due to worsening of pre-existing ataxia. These events occurred most frequently within the first 4 weeks of treatment.

Patients should be monitored for these signs and symptoms and advised not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on levetiracetam to gauge whether it could adversely affect their ability to drive or operate machinery.

5.7 Withdrawal Seizures

As with most antiepileptic drugs, levetiracetam should generally be withdrawn gradually because of the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus. If withdrawal is needed because of a serious adverse reaction, rapid discontinuation can be considered.

### Determining when to stop antiepileptic drug treatment [^116QJnnq]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

As the number of patients diagnosed with epilepsy continues to rise and the pharmacological and device-based treatment options for epilepsy increase, determining when to stop antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment continues to be an important issue for patient management and counseling.

Recent Findings

This review focuses on outcomes following AED withdrawal in seizure-free adults with epilepsy. Practical considerations are also discussed because, despite the importance of this topic, relatively little progress has been made in the past year regarding the identification of patients whose risk for recurrent seizures after AED withdrawal is no higher than that of the general population.

Summary

Although articles in the past year have updated the debates about whether and when to discontinue AEDs in seizure-free adults and have suggested potential utility for electroencephalograms as a prognostic tool for AED reduction as well as for an AED withdrawal risk calculator, decisions about AED withdrawal should still be based on the known risks and consequences of seizure recurrence and be made following well documented discussions between doctor and patient/carer.

### Levetiracetam add-on for drug-resistant focal epilepsy [^115YCjdw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Drug resistance is common in focal epilepsy. In this update, we summarised the current evidence regarding add-on levetiracetam in treating drug-resistant focal epilepsy. The original review was published in 2001 and last updated in 2012.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of levetiracetam when used as an add-on treatment for people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web, which includes the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register and CENTRAL), MEDLINE Ovid, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) to November 2018. We contacted the manufacturers of levetiracetam and researchers in the field to seek any ongoing or unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, placebo-controlled trials of add-on levetiracetam treatment in people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trials for bias, extracted data, and evaluated the overall certainty of the evidence. Outcomes investigated included 50% or greater reduction in focal seizure frequency (response), treatment withdrawal, adverse effects (including a specific analysis of changes in behaviour), cognitive effects, and quality of life (QoL). Primary analysis was intention-to-treat. We performed meta-analysis for all outcomes using a Mantel-Haenszel approach and calculated risk ratios (RR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for all estimates apart from adverse effects (99% CIs). We assessed heterogeneity using a Chi² test and the I² statistic.

Main Results

This update included 14 trials (2455 participants), predominantly possessing low risks of bias. Participants were adults in 12 trials (2159 participants) and children in the remaining two (296 participants). The doses of levetiracetam tested were 500 mg/day to 4000 mg/day in adults, and 60 mg/kg/day in children. Treatment ranged from 12 to 24 weeks. When individual doses were examined, levetiracetam at either 500 mg/day or 4000 mg/day did not perform better than placebo for the 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency outcome (500 mg: RR 1.60, 95% CI 0.71 to 3.62; P = 0.26; 4000 mg: RR 1.64, 95% CI 0.59 to 4.57; P = 0.34). Levetiracetam was significantly better than placebo at all other individual doses (1000 mg to 3000 mg). RR was significantly in favour of levetiracetam compared to placebo when results were pooled across all doses (RR 2.37, 95% CI 2.02 to 2.78; 14 studies, 2455 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Dose-response analysis demonstrated that the odds of achieving response (50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency) were increased by nearly 40% (odds ratio (OR) 1.39, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.58) for each 1000 mg increase in dose of levetiracetam. There were important levels of heterogeneity across multiple comparisons. Participants were not significantly more likely to experience treatment withdrawal with levetiracetam than with placebo (pooled RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.40; 13 studies, 2428 participants; high-certainty evidence). Somnolence was the most common adverse effect, affecting 13% of participants, and it was significantly associated with levetiracetam compared to placebo (pooled RR 1.62, 99% CI 1.19 to 2.20; 13 studies, 2423 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Changes in behaviour were negligible in adults (1% affected; RR 1.79, 99% CI 0.59 to 5.41), but significant in children (23% affected; RR 1.90, 99% CI 1.16 to 3.11). Levetiracetam had a positive effect on some aspects of cognition and QoL in adults and worsened certain aspects of child behaviour.

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, this review update finds that in both adults and children with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, levetiracetam added on to usual care is more effective than placebo at reducing seizure frequency, it is unlikely to be stopped by patients, and it has minimal adverse effects outside of potential worsening behaviour in children. These findings are unchanged from the previous review update in 2012. This review update contributes two key additional findings: 1. a 500 mg daily dose of levetiracetam is no more effective than placebo at reducing seizures; and 2. the odds of response (50% reduction in seizure frequency) are increased by nearly 40% for each 1000 mg increase in dose of levetiracetam. It seems reasonable to continue the use of levetiracetam in both adults and children with drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

### Placebo-controlled study of levetiracetam in idiopathic generalized epilepsy [^115eQ8DL]. Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and tolerability of adjunctive levetiracetam in patients with uncontrolled generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures associated with idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGE).

Methods

This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study enrolled adults and children (4 to 65 years) with IGE experiencing ≥ 3 GTC seizures during the 8-week baseline period (4-week retrospective and 4-week prospective), despite receiving stable doses of one or two antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Patients were randomized to levetiracetam (target dose 3,000 mg/day for adults; 60 mg/kg/day for children) or placebo and a 4-week titration period was followed by a 20-week evaluation period.

Results

Of 229 patients screened, 164 were randomized (levetiracetam, n = 80; placebo, n = 84). Levetiracetam produced a greater mean reduction in GTC seizure frequency per week over the treatment period (56.5%) than placebo (28.2%; p = 0.004). The percentage of patients who had ≥ 50% reduction of GTC seizure frequency per week (responders) during the treatment period was 72.2% for levetiracetam and 45.2% for placebo (p < 0.001; OR 3.28; 95% CI 1.68 to 6.38). During the first 2-week treatment 64.6% of patients on levetiracetam and 45.2% on placebo (p = 0.018) were classified as responders. During the evaluation period the percent of patients free of GTC seizures (34.2% vs 10.7%; p < 0.001) and all seizure types (24.1% vs 8.3%; p = 0.009) was greater for levetiracetam than placebo. Levetiracetam was well tolerated with 1.3% of patients discontinuing therapy due to adverse events vs 4.8% on placebo.

Conclusion

Adjunctive levetiracetam is an effective and well-tolerated antiepileptic drug for treating generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsies.

### Levetiracetam add-on for drug-resistant focal epilepsy: an updated cochrane review [^115Tz7Qz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Epilepsy is an important neurological condition and drug resistance in epilepsy is particularly common in individuals with focal seizures. In this review, we summarise the current evidence regarding a new antiepileptic drug, levetiracetam, when used as add-on treatment for controlling drug-resistant focal epilepsy. This is an update to a Cochrane Review that was originally published in 2001.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of levetiracetam, added on to usual care, in treating drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialized Register (August 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library Issue 7, 2012), and MEDLINE (1946 to August week 1, 2012). We also contacted the manufacturers of levetiracetam and researchers in the field to seek any ongoing or unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, placebo-controlled trials of add-on levetiracetam treatment in people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trials for bias, extracted data, and evaluated the overall quality of evidence. Outcomes investigated included 50% or greater reduction in focal seizure frequency (response); less than 50% reduction in focal seizure frequency (non-response); treatment withdrawal; adverse effects (including a specific analysis of changes in behaviour); cognitive effects and quality of life (QoL). Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used as measures of effect (99% CIs for adverse effects). Primary analyses were Intention-to-Treat (ITT). Dose response and inter-trial heterogeneity were evaluated in regression models.

Main Results

Eleven trials (1861 participants) were included. They predominantly possessed low risks of bias. Participants were adults in nine trials (1565 participants) and children in the remaining two trials (296 participants). The dose of levetiracetam tested was 1000 to 4000 mg/day in adults, and 60 mg/kg/day in children. Treatment ranged from 12 to 24 weeks. For the 50% or greater reduction in focal seizure frequency outcome, the RR was significantly in favour of levetiracetam at all doses. The naive estimates, ignoring dose, showed children (52% responded) as better responders than adults (39% responded) on levetiracetam. 25% of children and 16% of adults responded to placebo. The Number Needed to Treat for an additional beneficial outcome for children and adults was four (95% CI three to seven) and five (95% CI four to six), respectively. The significant levels of statistical heterogeneity between trials on adults precluded valid provision of an overall RR (ignoring dose). Results for the two trials that tested levetiracetam 2000 mg on adults were sufficiently similar to be combined to give an RR for 50% or greater reduction in focal seizure frequency of 4.91 (95% CI 2.75 to 8.77), with an RR of 0.68 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.77) for non-response. At this dose, 37% and 8% of adults were responders in the levetiracetam and placebo groups, respectively. Regression analysis demonstrated that much of the heterogeneity between adult trials was likely to be explained by different doses of levetiracetam tested and different years of trial publication. There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity between trials on children. For these trials, the RR for 50% or greater reduction in focal seizure frequency was 1.91 (95% CI 1.38 to 2.63), with an RR of 0.68 (95% CI 0.56 to 0.81) for non-response. 27% of children responded. Participants were not significantly more likely to have levetiracetam withdrawn (RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.32 and RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.43 to 1.46 for adults and children, respectively). For adults, somnolence (RR 1.51; 99% CI 1.06 to 2.17) and infection (RR 1.76; 99% CI 1.03 to 3.02) were significantly associated with levetiracetam. Accidental injury was significantly associated with placebo (RR 0.60; 99% CI 0.39 to 0.92). No individual adverse effect was significantly associated with levetiracetam in children. Changes in behaviour were negligible in adults (1% affected; RR 1.79; 99% CI 0.59 to 5.41) but significant in children (23% affected; RR 1.90; 99% CI 1.16 to 3.11). Cognitive effect and QoL outcomes suggested that levetiracetam had a positive effect on cognition and some aspects of QoL in adults. In children, levetiracetam did not appear to alter cognitive function but there was evidence of worsening in certain aspects of child behaviour. The overall quality of evidence used was high.

Authors' Conclusions

This update adds seven more trials to the original review, which contained four trials. At every dose analysed, levetiracetam significantly reduced focal seizure frequency relative to placebo. This indicates that levetiracetam can significantly reduce focal seizure frequency when it is used as an add-on treatment for both adults and children with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. As there was evidence of significant levels of statistical heterogeneity within this positive effect it is difficult to be precise about the relative magnitude of the effect. At a dose of 2000 mg, levetiracetam may be expected to be 3.9 times more effective than placebo; with 30% of adults being responders at this dose. At a dose of 60 mg/kg/day, levetiracetam may be expected to be 0.9 times more effective than placebo; with 25% of children being responders at this dose. When dose was ignored, children were better responders than adults by around 4% to 13%. The results grossly suggest that one child or adult may respond to levetiracetam for every four or five children or adults, respectively, that have received levetiracetam rather than placebo. The drug seems to be well tolerated in both adults and children although non-specific changes in behaviour may be experienced in as high as 20% of children. This aspect of the adverse-effect profile of levetiracetam was analysed crudely and requires further investigation and validation. It seems reasonable to continue the use of levetiracetam in both adults and children with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. The results cannot be used to confirm longer-term or monotherapy effects of levetiracetam or its effects on generalised seizures. The conclusions are largely unchanged from those in the original review. The most significant contribution of this update is the addition of paediatric data into the analysis.

### Levetiracetam injection (levetiracetam) [^117ME6d9]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Table 2 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 1% of adult epilepsy patients receiving levetiracetam tablets in placebo-controlled studies and were numerically more common than in patients treated with placebo. In these studies, either levetiracetam or placebo was added to concurrent AED therapy. Adverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in intensity.

Table 2: Adverse Reactions* In Placebo-Controlled, Adjunctive Studies In Adults Experiencing Partial-Onset Seizures

* Adverse reactions occurred in at least 1% of levetiracetam-treated patients and occurred more frequently than placebo-treated patients

In controlled adult clinical studies using levetiracetam tablets, 15% of patients receiving levetiracetam and 12% receiving placebo either discontinued or had a dose reduction as a result of an adverse reaction. Table 3 lists the most common (> 1%) adverse reactions that resulted in discontinuation or dose reduction and that occurred more frequently in levetiracetam-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients.

Table 3: Adverse Reactions that Resulted in Discontinuation or Dose Reduction in Placebo-Controlled Studies in Adults Experiencing Partial-Onset Seizures

Myoclonic Seizures

Although the pattern of adverse reactions in this study seems somewhat different from that seen in patients with partial seizures, this is likely due to the much smaller number of patients in this study compared to partial seizure studies. The adverse reaction pattern for patients with JME is expected to be essentially the same as for patients with partial seizures.

### Antiseizure medication withdrawal in seizure-free patients: practice advisory update summary: report of the AAN guideline subcommittee [^116hNNjP]. Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Antiseizure medication (ASM) withdrawal — adult seizure-free patients: One Class I study and 3 Class III studies examined this question. In the Class I randomized trial of 160 adults seizure-free for 2 years, patients were randomized to ASM withdrawal or continuance, and during 12 months seizure recurrence was not significantly different: 15% vs 7% (RR 2.4, 95% CI 0.85–7.08; p = 0.95). A nonrandomized, mostly adult, cohort found at 60 months the chance of remaining seizure-free was 68% with continued treatment vs 48% with withdrawal; after multivariate adjustment, the hazard ratio for seizure recurrence with withdrawal was 2.9 (95% CI 1.8–4.6; p < 0.001). Another Class III trial randomized 1,013 patients who were seizure-free for at least 2 years to continued ASM treatment vs withdrawal, and a majority of seizure recurrences were generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) (74%). The risk of seizure recurrence is low compared with other studies with a higher risk of bias.

### Seizure risk in brain tumor patients with conversion to generic levetiracetam [^1174vDhQ]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Breakthrough seizure activity has been reported with conversion from brand name to generic anticonvulsants. This has prompted several organizations to support physician notification of generic substitution and patient consent. Recently, a generic formulation of levetiracetam has become available. Risk of seizures with generic levetiracetam has yet to be reported. Literature was reviewed regarding risk of generic substitution. Four cases of seizure activity in primary brain tumor patients after conversion from Keppra to generic levetiracetam are reported. In all cases, there was no evidence of tumor growth or concurrent illness that would increase the risk of seizures. In three cases, the patients have remained seizure free with conversion back to Keppra. The final patient required an increased dose of levetiracetam. As has been described with generic substitution of other anticonvulsants, patients switched to generic levetiracetam may be at risk for breakthrough seizure activity.

### Antiseizure medication withdrawal in seizure-free patients: practice advisory update summary: report of the AAN guideline subcommittee [^113dtGfM]. Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Adults with epilepsy — ASM withdrawal counseling and shared decision-making — In adults who are seizure-free for at least 2 years, there should be a discussion between the clinician and the patient or caregiver about the risks and benefits of ASM withdrawal, including that there is possibly higher seizure recurrence in patients who had ASM withdrawal and that if seizures recur during or after withdrawal, there is a small chance they will no longer respond to medications (Level B). When discussing either ASM withdrawal or continuation with patients, clinicians may consider individual patient characteristics and preferences (Level C). Counseling must include discussion that there is not strong evidence regarding the relationship between ASM withdrawal and changes in the risk of mortality and status epilepticus, and, as such, these risks have not been excluded by the evidence (Level A). Clinicians should counsel that recurrent seizures put people at risk for status epilepticus and death, although existing data do not suggest an increased risk of status epilepticus or death after ASM withdrawal (Level B). Clinicians must explore contributors to the quality of life of individual patients as part of shared decision-making regarding ASM discontinuation (Level A), and clinicians should discuss with seizure-free patients that it is unknown if EEG or imaging studies inform the decision to withdraw ASMs (Level B). Additional context notes that low-quality evidence suggests no difference in quality of life between patients with well-controlled epilepsy who stop vs continue ASMs, and that in the 1-year follow-up of 1 trial there were no deaths, while in the 6-year follow-up of another trial deaths occurred only in patients continuing ASMs; there is only 1 low-quality trial regarding epilepsy surgery and ASM withdrawal, and no conclusions can be drawn.

### Early versus late antiepileptic drug withdrawal for people with epilepsy in remission [^1113Lgfo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are used to prevent seizures but are associated with both short and long term adverse effects. When epilepsy is in remission, it may be in the patient's best interest to discontinue medication. However, the optimal timing of AED discontinuation is not known.

Objectives

To quantify seizure relapse risk after early (less than two seizure free years) versus late (more than two seizure free years) AED withdrawal in adult and pediatric epilepsy patients. To assess which variables modify the risk of seizure recurrence.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group trials register, the Cochrane Controlled trials register (Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2000), MEDLINE (January 1996 to January 2001), EMBASE, Index Medicus, CINAHL, as well as hand-searching of journals.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials that evaluate withdrawal of AEDs after varying periods of seizure remission in adult and pediatric epilepsy patients with or without blinding were included. Included studies compared an early versus late AED discontinuation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Relative risks with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each trial. Summary relative risks and 95% confidence intervals for dichotomous data were calculated using a random effects model. A test of statistical heterogeneity was conducted for each pooled relative risk calculation.

Main Results

Seven eligible controlled trials were included in the analysis representing 924 randomized pediatric patients. There were no eligible trials evaluating adult seizure free patients. The pooled relative risk for seizure relapse in early versus late AED withdrawal was 1.32 (95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.70). On the basis of this estimate, the number needed to harm, that is expose an individual to a higher risk of seizure relapse because of early withdrawal of AED, is 10. Early discontinuation was associated with greater relapse rates in patients with partial seizures[pooled RR = 1.52; 95% confidence interval 0.95 to 2.41] or an abnormal EEG [pooled RR = 1.67; 95% confidence interval 0.93 to 3.00].

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is evidence to support waiting for at least two or more seizure free years before discontinuing AEDs in children, particularly if individuals have an abnormal EEG and partial seizures. There is insufficient evidence to establish when to withdraw AEDs in pediatric patients with generalized seizures. There is no evidence to guide the timing of withdrawal of AEDs in adult seizure free patients. Further blinded randomized controlled trials are needed to identify the optimal timing of AED withdrawal and risk factors predictive of relapse.

KOMET — levetiracetam (LEV) vs extended-release valproic acid (VPA-ER) or CBZ-CR in adolescents (aged ≥ 16 years) and adults with new-onset epilepsy: This Class III multicenter, randomized, open-label parallel study enrolled 1,688 outpatients and randomized (1:1) to LEV or a clinician-selected standard (VPA-ER or CBZ-CR). Initial target doses over 2 weeks were LEV 1,000 mg/d, VPA-ER 1,000 mg/d, and CBZ-CR 600 mg/d, with possible increases to 3,000 mg/d (LEV), 2,000 mg/d (VPA-ER), and 1,600 mg/d (CBZ-CR). The primary outcome was time to treatment failure; time to treatment withdrawal was similar for LEV and VPA-ER and was nonsignificantly longer with LEV than with CBZ-CR. Drug-related AE frequency and AE-related discontinuations were comparable; most frequent AEs were weight gain and tremor with VPA, depression with LEV, and rash with CBZ-CR, while headache, fatigue, and dizziness were equally frequent across drugs.

### Discontinuing antiepileptic drugs in long-standing idiopathic generalised epilepsy [^111mmNmr]. Journal of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Once adults with long-standing idiopathic generalised epilepsy have achieved stable seizure remission, patients or physicians may attempt to discontinue their antiepileptic drug treatment. To date, risk of subsequent seizure relapse across the four idiopathic generalised epilepsy syndromes is largely unknown, and so are the clinical variables associated.

Methods

For this retrospective observational study, 256 adult outpatients with idiopathic generalised epilepsy were evaluated. Data were obtained from outpatient charts and, if possible, from additional telephone or mail interviews.

Results

In 84 patients (33%), antiepileptic medication was discontinued at least once. Median patient age at antiepileptic drug withdrawal was 33 years, and median duration of subsequent follow-up was 20 years. Seizures recurred in 46% of patients after a median latency of 11 months. Following multivariable analysis, seizure relapse was independently associated with short duration of seizure remission beforehand. If medication was withdrawn after < 5 years of seizure freedom, two-thirds of patients had a seizure relapse, while among those in remission for ≥ 5 years, only one-third relapsed.

Conclusions

Discontinuation of antiepileptic drug treatment can be successful in every other adult with long-standing idiopathic generalised epilepsy. Short duration of prior seizure remission appears to be a relevant predictor of seizure recurrence.

### Levetiracetam in toxic seizures [^111d7ERg]. Clinical Toxicology (2018). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

The use of levetiracetam (LEV) in the management of drug-induced seizures has not been systematically investigated. Repetitive and continuous seizures that do not respond to benzodiazepines require second line therapy. Levetiracetam has a unique receptor binding site, rapid absorption, no known cardiac effects at therapeutic doses, and is theoretically a good candidate for use in drug-induced seizures. We evaluate the safety of LEV and its association with seizure cessation in this retrospective chart review of patients who received LEV as a control agent in drug-induced seizures.

Methods

We identified the medical records of patients presenting to an urban, level 1 trauma center between 1 January 2010 and 31 May 2015 by ICD-9 codes based on the following: (1) a poisoning diagnosis, (2) a seizure diagnosis, and (3) administration of LEV. We included patients with a drug-induced seizure based on history, electroencephalogram results, blood alcohol concentrations, urine drug screens, and adequate documentation. We excluded patients with alcohol withdrawal, anoxic brain injury, subtherapeutic concentrations of other antiepileptics, hypoglycemia, and pseudoseizures. Primary outcomes of interest included cessation of active seizures or the prevention of seizure recurrence. We assessed safety by the presence or absence of adverse drug effects (ADE) attributed to the administration of LEV.

Results

Thirty-four patients met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Half of the study cohort (17) presented with generalized tonic-clonic seizures (TCS); half (17) presented in generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE). Six patients in GCSE received LEV during their seizures; 2 also received fosphenytoin. One improved immediately following LEV administration, and the remaining 5 had seizure control. Eleven GCSE patients (65%) remained seizure free after LEV therapy. The patients with TCS (17) received LEV after seizure(s) control. Sixteen (94%) were seizure-free during their hospital course. We found no adverse drug effects. In total, 27 of 34 patients (79%) had a return to baseline neurological and physical health. Six had long-term sequelae; none of which are known LEV side-effects. We identified 46 toxic substances and 22 known seizurogenic agents (48%). The median length of stay was 3.7 days (0.4–96), and the median duration of in-hospital LEV therapy was 1.6 days (0–49).

Conclusions

Levetiracetam used as a second-line agent was associated with control of drug-induced seizures and prevention of seizure recurrence without obvious adverse effects. A prospective study is needed to confirm these results.

14.3 Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures

The effectiveness of levetiracetam as adjunctive therapy in patients 6 years of age and older with idiopathic generalized epilepsy experiencing primary generalized tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures was established in one multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 7), conducted at 50 sites in 8 countries. Eligible patients on a stable dose of 1 or 2 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) experiencing at least 3 PGTC seizures during the 8-week combined baseline period (at least one PGTC seizure during the 4 weeks prior to the prospective baseline period and at least one PGTC seizure during the 4-week prospective baseline period) were randomized to either levetiracetam or placebo. The 8-week combined baseline period is referred to as "baseline" in the remainder of this section. Patients were titrated over 4 weeks to a target dose of 3000 mg/day for adults or a pediatric target dose of 60 mg/kg/day and treated at a stable dose of 3000 mg/day (or 60 mg/kg/day for children) over 20 weeks (evaluation period). Study drug was given in 2 equally divided doses per day. The primary measure of effectiveness was the percent reduction from baseline in weekly PGTC seizure frequency for levetiracetam and placebo treatment groups over the treatment period (titration + evaluation periods). The population included 164 patients (levetiracetam N = 80, placebo N = 84) with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (predominately juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, juvenile absence epilepsy, childhood absence epilepsy, or epilepsy with Grand Mal seizures on awakening) experiencing primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Each of these syndromes of idiopathic generalized epilepsy was well represented in this patient population.

There was a statistically significant decrease from baseline in PGTC frequency in the levetiracetam-treated patients compared to the placebo-treated patients.

### Early versus late antiepileptic drug withdrawal for people with epilepsy in remission [^113a6PvA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder which affects millions of people around the world. Antiepileptic drugs (AED) are the main interventions used to prevent seizures and control epilepsy. Although effective in most cases, AEDs are related to long-term adverse effects, such as cognitive and behavioural alterations. Thus when epilepsy is in remission, it may be in the individual's best interest to discontinue medication. However, the optimal timing of AED discontinuation is still unknown. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 3, 2001.

Objectives

(1) To quantify and compare risk of seizure recurrence, status epilepticus and mortality after early and late AED discontinuation in adult and pediatric epilepsy patients.(2) To assess which variables modify the risk of seizure recurrence.(3) To define a subpopulation in which early AED discontinuation is safe.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register (June 2014); CENTRAL (Issue 5, The Cochrane Library, May 2014); MEDLINE (1946 to June 2014); CINAHL (23 June 2014); Scopus (1823 to June 2014); ClinicalTrials.gov (23 June 2014); and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (23 June 2014). We also checked the reference lists of studies found through the electronic searches.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials that evaluate withdrawal of AEDs after varying periods of seizure remission in adults and children with epilepsy. Included studies compared an early AED discontinuation time (defined as a period of remission of seizures of less than two years) versus a late AED discontinuation time (defined as a period of remission of seizures of more than two years).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for each trial. Summary RRs and 95% CIs for dichotomous data were calculated using a fixed-effect model. A test of statistical heterogeneity was conducted for each pooled risk ratio calculation. Each included study underwent a 'Risk of bias' assessment, based on the Cochrane Handbook recommendations, and we examined the overall quality of information through the GRADE system, presented in two 'Summary of Findings' tables.

Main Results

Five trials were included in this review, representing 924 randomised children with epilepsy, all under 16 years of age at randomisation, with a median follow-up of 5.6 years. No eligible trial evaluated adults or assessed mortality or status epilepticus as outcomes. The pooled risk ratio for seizure relapse after AED withdrawal was 1.34 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.59, P = 0.0007). Conforming to this estimate, the number needed to harm, that is expose an individual to a higher risk of seizure relapse because of early withdrawal of AED, is 8 (95% CI 5 to 20). Early discontinuation was associated with greater relapse rates in people with partial seizures with a pooled risk ratio of 1.51 (95% CI 0.97 to 2.35, P = 0.07). Absence type epilepsy showed a lower risk of relapse. Variables associated with higher risk of seizure relapse were abnormal EEG findings (pooled RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.83, P = 0.003), especially epileptiform activity (RR 2.58, 95% CI 2.03 to 3.28, P < 0.0001); epilepsy onset before 2 years or after 10 years of age; history of status epilepticus; intellectual disability (IQ < 70); and high seizure frequency before and during treatment. Gender and family history did not show any significant influence over seizure relapse. Overall, the included trials were classified as low or unclear risk of bias where methodological information was not reported and could not be provided by original study authors.

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence to support waiting for at least two seizure-free years before discontinuing AEDs in children, particularly if individuals have an abnormal EEG or partial seizures, or both. There is insufficient evidence to establish when to withdraw AEDs in children with generalised seizures. There is no evidence to guide the timing of withdrawal of AEDs in seizure-free adults. Further high-quality randomised controlled trials are needed, particularly recruiting adults and recruiting those with generalised seizure types, to identify the optimal timing of AED withdrawal and risk factors predictive of relapse.

### Non-discontinuation of antiseizure medication in seizure-free epilepsy patients [^113yWmAu]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

In people with epilepsy, antiseizure medication (ASM) is the main pillar of treatment. Approximately 60%–85% of patients achieve sustained seizure freedom. When patients have become seizure‐free for some time, the question arises whether ASM may be discontinued. Typically, physicians recommend discontinuing ASM or reducing its dose significantly only when they estimate the risk for seizure recurrence to be low. Several factors have been described to be associated with seizure remission after ASM discontinuation.

As duration since last seizure is one of the strongest predictors for remaining seizure‐free, ASM discontinuation is usually recommended if the patient has been without seizures for a minimum of 2 years. However, a significant proportion of patients remain on ASM long beyond that time. As long‐term ASM therapy may be associated with significant adverse effects, which reduce quality of life and impose financial burdens on the healthcare system, it is important to identify factors associated with lack of discontinuation or significant dose reduction of ASM.

Previous studies on seizure‐free patients have shown that ASM discontinuation is discussed in only 30%–50% of outpatient visits. In a recent study on a heterogeneous patient population with focus on the first decade of seizure freedom including children, adolescents and adults treated in monotherapy and polytherapy, the decision to attempt ASM discontinuation was independently associated with four variables: longer duration of seizure freedom, treatment with an older generation ASM, self‐limiting epilepsy syndrome and lower estimated risk of seizure recurrence as calculated with the antiepileptic drug withdrawal risk retrieval tool.

Nevertheless, there are gaps in the evidence regarding ASM discontinuation practices in outpatient epilepsy clinics. It remains unstudied how previous unsuccessful discontinuation attempts and breakthrough seizures influence ASM discontinuation decisions. Furthermore, open questions persist regarding timing of ASM discontinuation, particularly concerning discontinuation after more than 10 years of seizure freedom. It is possible that the probability of discontinuing ASM or reducing the dose is lower after a long time of seizure freedom as either the patients have made a final decision regarding continuation of ASM therapy or the physicians have given up on suggesting ASM discontinuation.

In the light of these considerations, this study aims to examine factors associated with non‐discontinuation (i.e. lack of either discontinuation or dose reduction of at least 25%) of ASM monotherapy in seizure‐free patients.

Antiseizure medication (ASM) withdrawal in adults — risk of seizure recurrence: In a study primarily including adults, patients who withdrew ASMs had higher recurrence than those who continued (43% [221/510] vs 26% [133/501]; odds ratio [OR] 2.12, 95% CI 1.63–2.77; p < 0.0001). Another Class III study did not find a significant difference in risk of more than one seizure after a single recurrence (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.63–1.72). In the long term (24–60 months), the risk of seizure recurrence is possibly higher among those who taper ASMs (low confidence, 2 Class III studies).

Clinical context — when a patient with a first seizure has one or more ensuing seizures, an antiepileptic drug (AED) should be initiated because the risk of additional seizures is very high (57% by 1 year and 73% by 4 years), with risk increasing proportionally after each subsequent recurrence as the time interval between seizures decreases, whereas immediate AED treatment at the time of the first unprovoked seizure is not well accepted and is debated.

Anti-Seizure Medication Withdrawal in Medically Treated Seizure-Free Patients

More than two-thirds of patients will reach remission with ASMs throughout the course of their disorder. When seizure-freedom is reached with ASMs, the question may arise after a while whether drugs are still needed. Since ASMs suppress seizures rather than modify disease, withdrawal is expected to merely unveil the natural history of the patient's epilepsy. There is no proof that ASM discontinuation itself causes epilepsy or aggravates epileptogenesis. Anti-seizure medication withdrawal may unmask the still active tendency of the brain to generate seizures in those who relapse.

Recommendations for ASM withdrawal policies are remarkably sparse. According to a recent American Academy of Neurology Practice Advisory Update Summary, "the long-term risk of seizure recurrence is possibly higher among adults who have been seizure-free for 2 years and taper ASMs versus those who continue. In children, there is probably no significant difference in relapse risk between those who taper after 2 versus 4 years, and insufficient evidence of difference between tapering after 18 or 24 months". Two studies were instrumental; in the first double-blinded randomized controlled trial in 160 adults on 1 ASM who were seizure-free for at least 2 years, withdrawal led to a 1 year seizure recurrence relative risk (RR) of 2.46 (95% CI 0.85–7.08, P = 0.095) compared to continuing drugs. The second randomized trial was non-blinded and showed in 1013 patients who were 2 or more years in remission that ASM withdrawal was associated with a 2 years relapse RR of 2.12 (95% CI 1.63–2.77, P < 0.001).

### The SANAD II study of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of levetiracetam, zonisamide, or lamotrigine for newly diagnosed focal epilepsy: an open-label, non-inferiority, multicentre, phase 4, randomised controlled trial [^113w3TZk]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

Levetiracetam and zonisamide are licensed as monotherapy for patients with focal epilepsy, but there is uncertainty as to whether they should be recommended as first-line treatments because of insufficient evidence of clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. We aimed to assess the long-term clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of levetiracetam and zonisamide compared with lamotrigine in people with newly diagnosed focal epilepsy.

Methods

This randomised, open-label, controlled trial compared levetiracetam and zonisamide with lamotrigine as first-line treatment for patients with newly diagnosed focal epilepsy. Adult and paediatric neurology services across the UK recruited participants aged 5 years or older (with no upper age limit) with two or more unprovoked focal seizures. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1:1) using a minimisation programme with a random element utilising factor to receive lamotrigine, levetiracetam, or zonisamide. Participants and investigators were not masked and were aware of treatment allocation. SANAD II was designed to assess non-inferiority of both levetiracetam and zonisamide to lamotrigine for the primary outcome of time to 12-month remission. Anti-seizure medications were taken orally and for participants aged 12 years or older the initial advised maintenance doses were lamotrigine 50 mg (morning) and 100 mg (evening), levetiracetam 500 mg twice per day, and zonisamide 100 mg twice per day. For children aged between 5 and 12 years the initial daily maintenance doses advised were lamotrigine 1.5 mg/kg twice per day, levetiracetam 20 mg/kg twice per day, and zonisamide 2.5 mg/kg twice per day. All participants were included in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. The per-protocol (PP) analysis excluded participants with major protocol deviations and those who were subsequently diagnosed as not having epilepsy. Safety analysis included all participants who received one dose of any study drug. The non-inferiority limit was a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.329, which equates to an absolute difference of 10%. A HR greater than 1 indicated that an event was more likely on lamotrigine. The trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, 30294119 (EudraCt number: 2012–001884–64).

Findings

990 participants were recruited between May 2, 2013, and June 20, 2017, and followed up for a further 2 years. Patients were randomly assigned to receive lamotrigine (n = 330), levetiracetam (n = 332), or zonisamide (n = 328). The ITT analysis included all participants and the PP analysis included 324 participants randomly assigned to lamotrigine, 320 participants randomly assigned to levetiracetam, and 315 participants randomly assigned to zonisamide. Levetiracetam did not meet the criteria for non-inferiority in the ITT analysis of time to 12-month remission versus lamotrigine (HR 1.18; 97.5% CI 0.95–1.47) but zonisamide did meet the criteria for non-inferiority in the ITT analysis versus lamotrigine (1.03; 0.83–1.28). The PP analysis showed that 12-month remission was superior with lamotrigine than both levetiracetam (HR 1.32 [97.5% CI 1.05 to 1.66]) and zonisamide (HR 1.37 [1.08–1.73]). There were 37 deaths during the trial. Adverse reactions were reported by 108 (33%) participants who started lamotrigine, 144 (44%) participants who started levetiracetam, and 146 (45%) participants who started zonisamide. Lamotrigine was superior in the cost-utility analysis, with a higher net health benefit of 1.403 QALYs (97.5% central range 1.319–1.458) compared with 1.222 (1.110–1.283) for levetiracetam and 1.232 (1.112, 1.307) for zonisamide at a cost-effectiveness threshold of £20000 per QALY. Cost-effectiveness was based on differences between treatment groups in costs and QALYs.

Interpretation

These findings do not support the use of levetiracetam or zonisamide as first-line treatments for patients with focal epilepsy. Lamotrigine should remain a first-line treatment for patients with focal epilepsy and should be the standard treatment in future trials.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with seizures: approved by the ACEP board of directors, April 17, 2024 [^117FHj6i]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Status epilepticus pharmacotherapy — prospective nonrandomized studies report seizure control with valproate, phenytoin, and levetiracetam with specified dosing and time-to-cessation outcomes. Patients with refractory convulsive status epilepticus who failed IV diazepam and IM phenobarbital were given valproate 30 mg/kg IV at 6 mg/kg/h, with cessation of motor activity within 1 h of starting infusion and valproate controlled seizures within 1 h in 88% (95% CI 78% to 97%). In a prospective, nonrandomized, open-label, controlled study of patients with status epilepticus or acute repetitive seizures receiving either IV phenytoin 18 mg/kg or valproate 30 mg/kg, the outcome was cessation of seizures within 20 min and enrolled 74 patients, with control of seizures in 88% regardless of treatment group. In a prospective nonrandomized trial assigning refractory status epilepticus to IV valproate 30 mg/kg vs levetiracetam 30 mg/kg, with cessation of seizure (electroencephalogram [EEG]) after infusion as the outcome, 82 patients entered, with equal efficacy between the 2 treatments; valproate 68% vs levetiracetam 73%.

Analytic scope and outcomes for ASM withdrawal — For patients with epilepsy taking ASMs who have been seizure-free for at least 12 months, the panel examined whether stopping ASMs compared with not stopping affects seizure recurrence, status epilepticus, medication-related side effects, quality of life, mortality, and whether any of these risks change based on the speed of ASM withdrawal; data for children were analyzed separately from adults, with adults defined as those aged 18 years or older and children as those younger than 18 years, and outcomes were measured at 12 months or more including seizure relapse (divided between children and adults and between those with electroclinical syndromes and epilepsy surgery) and risk factors that give odds ratios at the same time points as measured by the chance of seizure freedom.

### Levetiracetam (roweepra) [^1117SMzJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.8 Withdrawal Seizures

As with most antiepileptic drugs, Roweepra (levetiracetam) should generally be withdrawn gradually because of the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus. If withdrawal is needed because of a serious adverse reaction, rapid discontinuation can be considered.

5.9 Hematologic Abnormalities

Roweepra (levetiracetam) can cause hematologic abnormalities. Hematologic abnormalities occurred in clinical trials and included decreases in white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil, and red blood cell (RBC) counts; decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit; and increases in eosinophil counts. Cases of agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, and thrombocytopenia have been reported in the postmarketing setting. A complete blood count is recommended in patients experiencing significant weakness, pyrexia, recurrent infections, or coagulation disorders.

Partial-Onset Seizures

Adults

Minor, but statistically significant, decreases compared to placebo in total mean RBC count (0.03 x 106 /mm 3), mean hemoglobin (0.09 g/dL), and mean hematocrit (0.38%), were seen in levetiracetam-treated patients in controlled trials.

A total of 3.2% of levetiracetam-treated and 1.8% of placebo-treated patients had at least one possibly significant (≤ 2.8 x 10 9 /L) decreased WBC, and 2.4% of levetiracetam-treated and 1.4% of placebo-treated patients had at least one possibly significant (≤ 1.0 x 10 9 /L) decreased neutrophil count. Of the levetiracetam-treated patients with a low neutrophil count, all but one rose towards or to baseline with continued treatment. No patient was discontinued secondary to low neutrophil counts.

### The SANAD II study of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of valproate versus levetiracetam for newly diagnosed generalised and unclassifiable epilepsy: an open-label, non-inferiority, multicentre, phase 4, randomised controlled trial [^1139pthR]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

Valproate is a first-line treatment for patients with newly diagnosed idiopathic generalised or difficult to classify epilepsy, but not for women of child-bearing potential because of teratogenicity. Levetiracetam is increasingly prescribed for these patient populations despite scarcity of evidence of clinical effectiveness or cost-effectiveness. We aimed to compare the long-term clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of levetiracetam compared with valproate in participants with newly diagnosed generalised or unclassifiable epilepsy.

Methods

We did an open-label, randomised controlled trial to compare levetiracetam with valproate as first-line treatment for patients with generalised or unclassified epilepsy. Adult and paediatric neurology services (69 centres overall) across the UK recruited participants aged 5 years or older (with no upper age limit) with two or more unprovoked generalised or unclassifiable seizures. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive either levetiracetam or valproate, using a minimisation programme with a random element utilising factors. Participants and investigators were aware of treatment allocation. For participants aged 12 years or older, the initial advised maintenance doses were 500 mg twice per day for levetiracetam and valproate, and for children aged 5–12 years, the initial daily maintenance doses advised were 25 mg/kg for valproate and 40 mg/kg for levetiracetam. All drugs were administered orally. SANAD II was designed to assess the non-inferiority of levetiracetam compared with valproate for the primary outcome time to 12-month remission. The non-inferiority limit was a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.314, which equates to an absolute difference of 10%. A HR greater than 1 indicated that an event was more likely on valproate. All participants were included in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Per-protocol (PP) analyses excluded participants with major protocol deviations and those who were subsequently diagnosed as not having epilepsy. Safety analyses included all participants who received one dose of any study drug. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, 30294119 (EudraCt number: 2012–001884–64).

Findings

520 participants were recruited between April 30, 2013, and Aug 2, 2016, and followed up for a further 2 years. 260 participants were randomly allocated to receive levetiracetam and 260 participants to receive valproate. The ITT analysis included all participants and the PP analysis included 255 participants randomly allocated to valproate and 254 randomly allocated to levetiracetam. Median age of participants was 13.9 years (range 5.0–94.4), 65% were male and 35% were female, 397 participants had generalised epilepsy, and 123 unclassified epilepsy. Levetiracetam did not meet the criteria for non-inferiority in the ITT analysis of time to 12-month remission (HR 1.19 [95% CI 0.96–1.47]); non-inferiority margin 1.314. The PP analysis showed that the 12-month remission was superior with valproate than with levetiracetam. There were two deaths, one in each group, that were unrelated to trial treatments. Adverse reactions were reported by 96 (37%) participants randomly assigned to valproate and 107 (42%) participants randomly assigned to levetiracetam. Levetiracetam was dominated by valproate in the cost-utility analysis, with a negative incremental net health benefit of -0.040 (95% central range -0.175 to 0.037) and a probability of 0.17 of being cost-effectiveness at a threshold of £20000 per quality-adjusted life-year. Cost-effectiveness was based on differences between treatment groups in costs and quality-adjusted life-years.

Interpretation

Compared with valproate, levetiracetam was found to be neither clinically effective nor cost-effective. For girls and women of child-bearing potential, these results inform discussions about benefit and harm of avoiding valproate.

Summary

Background

Valproate is a first-line treatment for patients with newly diagnosed idiopathic generalised or difficult to classify epilepsy, but not for women of child-bearing potential because of teratogenicity. Levetiracetam is increasingly prescribed for these patient populations despite scarcity of evidence of clinical effectiveness or cost-effectiveness.

### Individualised prediction model of seizure recurrence and long-term outcomes after withdrawal of antiepileptic drugs in seizure-free patients: a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis [^113Aebda]. The Lancet: Neurology (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

People with epilepsy who became seizure-free while taking antiepileptic drugs might consider discontinuing their medication, with the possibility of increased quality of life because of the elimination of adverse events. The risk with this action, however, is seizure recurrence. The objectives of our study were to identify predictors of seizure recurrence and long-term seizure outcomes and to produce nomograms for estimation of individualised outcomes.

Methods

We did a systematic review and meta-analysis, and identified eligible articles and candidate predictors, using PubMed and Embase databases with a last update on Nov 6, 2014. Eligible articles had to report on cohorts of patients with epilepsy who were seizure-free and had started withdrawal of antiepileptic drugs; articles also had to contain information regarding seizure recurrences during and after withdrawal. We excluded surgical cohorts, reports with fewer than 30 patients, and reports on acute symptomatic seizures because these topics were beyond the scope of our objective. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality in Prognosis Studies system. Data analysis was based on individual participant data. Survival curves and proportional hazards were computed. The strongest predictors were selected with backward selection. Models were converted to nomograms and a web-based tool to determine individual risks.

Findings

We identified 45 studies with 7082 patients; ten studies (22%) with 1769 patients (25%) were included in the meta-analysis. Median follow-up was 5.3 years (IQR 3.0–10.0, maximum 23 years). Prospective and retrospective studies and randomised controlled trials were included, covering non-selected and selected populations of both children and adults. Relapse occurred in 812 (46%) of 1769 patients; 136 (9%) of 1455 for whom data were available had seizures in their last year of follow-up, suggesting enduring seizure control was not regained by this timepoint. Independent predictors of seizure recurrence were epilepsy duration before remission, seizure-free interval before antiepileptic drug withdrawal, age at onset of epilepsy, history of febrile seizures, number of seizures before remission, absence of a self-limiting epilepsy syndrome, developmental delay, and epileptiform abnormality on electroencephalogram (EEG) before withdrawal. Independent predictors of seizures in the last year of follow-up were epilepsy duration before remission, seizure-free interval before antiepileptic drug withdrawal, number of antiepileptic drugs before withdrawal, female sex, family history of epilepsy, number of seizures before remission, focal seizures, and epileptiform abnormality on EEG before withdrawal. Adjusted concordance statistics were 0.65 (95% CI 0.65–0.66) for predicting seizure recurrence and 0.71 (0.70–0.71) for predicting long-term seizure freedom. Validation was stable across the individual study populations.

Interpretation

We present evidence-based nomograms with robust performance across populations of children and adults. The nomograms facilitate prediction of outcomes following drug withdrawal for the individual patient, including both the risk of relapse and the chance of long-term freedom from seizures. The main limitations were the absence of a control group continuing antiepileptic drug treatment and a consistent definition of long-term seizure freedom.

### Antiseizure medication withdrawal in seizure-free patients: practice advisory update summary: report of the AAN guideline subcommittee [^11318N6h]. Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Evidence search and grading — scope and processes: In April 2013, Medline, CINAHL, DARE, and CENTRAL were searched for articles published between January 1991 and April 2013, yielding 2,148 articles; 17 articles from the 1996 practice parameter and Cochrane review were also reviewed. Of the reviewed abstracts, 154 were identified as potentially relevant and obtained for full-text review, and each of the 154 articles was reviewed by 2 panel members; later, each of the 164 articles was rated by 2 panel members using AAN criteria. An updated search in December 2016 identified 106 additional articles, none of which were included as they did not answer the questions or were Class IV. A modified form of GRADE was used to develop conclusions, the panel followed the AAN process to formulate rationales, recommendations must be supported by at least one premise, and the level of obligation was assigned using a modified Delphi process.

Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

KOMET — levetiracetam (LEV) versus extended-release valproic acid (VPA-ER) or carbamazepine controlled release (CBZ-CR) in new-onset epilepsy — was a Class III, randomized, open-label study of "1,688 outpatient adolescents (aged ≥ 16 years) and adults", with diagnoses of "34.8%" generalized epilepsy, "64.7%" focal epilepsy, and "1.2%" unclassified; patients were randomized "(1:1)" and initial targets over 2 weeks were "LEV 1,000 mg/d; VPA-ER 1,000 mg/d; CBZ-CR 600 mg/d", with possible increases to "3,000 mg/d", "2,000 mg/d", and "1,600 mg/d", respectively. Among standard-AED arms, "65.8%" on VPA-ER had only GE and "86.5%" on CBZ-CR had only focal epilepsy. The primary outcome was time to treatment failure; "Time to treatment withdrawal was similar for LEV and VPA-ER; a nonsignificantly longer time to treatment withdrawal occurred with LEV than with CBZ-CR". Adverse event frequencies were comparable, with weight gain and tremor with VPA, depression with LEV, and rash with CBZ-CR; the conclusion states, "Evidence is insufficient to compare efficacy of CBZ-CR, LEV, and VPA-ER" in adolescents and adults with new-onset GE and focal epilepsy.

Epilepsy Currents (2018). Medium credibility.

Treatment-resistant generalized epilepsy (GE) adjunctive therapy — lamotrigine (LTG) and levetiracetam (LEV): Both LTG-XR and immediate-release LTG are probably effective as add-on therapy for TR GTC seizures (1 Class I study for LTG-XR; 2 Class II studies for immediate-release LTG). For LEV, two Class I studies compared 3,000 mg/d of LEV and placebo in TR GE, including one with patients aged 4–65 years, and in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) or juvenile absence epilepsy, significantly more patients on LEV had a > 50% reduction in the number of days per week with myoclonic seizures, became free of myoclonic seizures, and became free of all seizure types. Recommendations specify that for add-on therapy for GE, immediate-release and LTG-XR should be considered as add-on therapy to decrease seizure frequency in treating adults with TR GTC seizures secondary to GE (Level B), and levetiracetam should be considered to decrease seizure frequency as add-on therapy for TR GTC seizures and for JME (Level B); a clinical context note states that only high LEV doses were used.

### Antiseizure medications (antiepileptic drugs) in adults: starting, monitoring and stopping [^113dioJe]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Up to 10% of people living to 80 years of age have one or more seizures; and many will not require anti-seizure medication (ASMs). In 85% of patients, the diagnosis comes from the history of the index event. One-third of patients with an apparent "first seizure" have previous events, changing their diagnosis to epilepsy. Targeted investigations are important for classification and risk prediction. Patients with a low risk of seizure recurrence are not usually offered ASM treatment. High-risk patients have multiple seizures, neurological deficits, intellectual disability and/or relevant abnormal investigations; and are offered ASMs. Individual factors modulate this decision-making. Future integrated technologies offer the game-changing potential for seizure monitoring and prediction, but are not yet robust, convenient or affordable. Therapeutic drug monitoring in patients taking ASMs may confirm ASM toxicity, or when non-adherence, malabsorption, or rapid metabolism are suspected causes of breakthrough seizures. They are less useful when these factors are intermittent or irregular. Current evidence does not favour routine monitoring of serum levels, as it neither reliably predicts control, relapse, or adverse effects. The decision to discontinue ASM should follow a full discussion with the patient of risks and benefits. Along with population risk factors for seizure recurrence, the patient's lifestyle and preferences must be considered. ASM are usually discontinued in a slow step-wise fashion, one at a time, after at least two years of remission. Seizure recurrence risk plateaus only after 2 years following ASM discontinuation, and patients need access to specialist follow-up over that period.

### Evidence-based guideline: management of an unprovoked first seizure in adults: report of the guideline development subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Epilepsy Society [^115MoJXq]. Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Unprovoked first seizure in adults — long-term prognosis with immediate vs delayed antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment: The generally accepted metric for assessing long-term outcome and prognosis is the seizure remission rate, which is a measure of maintaining seizure freedom for a specified time duration, typically 2 to 5 years; studies demonstrate that immediate AED treatment after an unprovoked first seizure as compared with treatment delayed pending another seizure does not increase the incidence of sustained seizure remission, and long-term survival evidence notes that immediate treatment does not affect mortality over a 20-year period. For adults presenting with an unprovoked first seizure, immediate AED treatment as compared with treatment delayed until a second seizure occurs is unlikely to improve the chance of attaining sustained seizure remission over the longer term (> 3 years) (1 Class I study, 1 Class II study).

### Rapid versus slow withdrawal of antiepileptic drugs [^112gLc1D]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The ideal objective of treating a person with epilepsy is to induce remission (free of seizures for some time) using antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and withdraw the AEDs without causing seizure recurrence. Prolonged usage of AEDs may have long-term adverse effects. Hence, when a person with epilepsy is in remission, it is logical to attempt to discontinue the medication. The timing of withdrawal and the mode of withdrawal arise while contemplating withdrawal of AEDs. This review examines the evidence for the rate of withdrawal of AEDs (whether rapid or slow tapering) and its effect on seizure recurrence. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in 2006, Issue 2.

Objectives

To quantify risk of seizure recurrence after rapid (tapering period of three months or less) or slow (tapering period of more than three months) discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs in adults and children with epilepsy who are in remission, and to assess which variables modify the risk of seizure recurrence.

Search Methods

For the latest update, on 9 April 2019, we searched: Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web, which includes the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov), MEDLINE (Ovid; 8 April 2019), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and SCOPUS. There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials that evaluate withdrawal of AEDs in a rapid or slow tapering after varying periods of seizure control in people with epilepsy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Review authors independently assessed the trials for inclusion and extracted the data. The outcomes assessed included seizure freedom after one, two, or five years of AED withdrawal; time to recurrence of seizure following withdrawal; occurrence of status epilepticus; mortality; morbidity due to seizure, such as injuries, fractures, and aspiration pneumonia; and quality of life (assessed by validated scale).

Main Results

In this review update, we have included one new study. The new study randomized 57 children with epilepsy with seizure freedom for at least two years to taper the AED during over one or six months. The study was not blinded and there were no details of randomization. Over the period of 54 months of follow-up, 20/30 participants in the one-month group remained seizure-free compared to 15/27 participants in the six-month group (no evidence of a difference). There was no information on time of seizure recurrence for each group to allow a comparison. One trial had already been included in the previous version of the review; it involved 149 children. There was a non-significant trend toward a lower risk of seizure recurrence after one year of AED withdrawal in participants allocated to slow tapering (risk ratio (RR) 0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58 to 1.01; P = 0.06; very low-certainty evidence). At the end of two years, 30 participants were seizure free in the rapid-tapering group and 29 participants in the slow-tapering group (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.29; P = 0.48; very low-certainty evidence). At the end of five years, 10 participants were seizure free in the rapid-tapering group and six participants in the slow-tapering group (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.54 to 3.65; P = 0.49; very low-certainty evidence). There were no data for the other outcomes. Due to the methodological heterogeneity and the difference in the duration of tapering we did not perform a quantitative synthesis of these studies.

Authors' Conclusions

Since the last version of this review was published, we found one new pediatric study. In view of methodological deficiencies, and small sample size of the two included studies, we cannot draw any reliable conclusions regarding the optimal rate of tapering of AEDs. Using GRADE, we assessed the certainty of the evidence as very low for outcomes for which data were available. We judged both studies to be at high risk of bias. Further studies are needed in adults and children to investigate the optimal rate of withdrawal of AEDs and to study the effects of variables such as seizure types, etiology, mental retardation, electroencephalography abnormalities, presence of neurologic deficits, and other comorbidities on the rate of tapering.

### The case for levetiracetam to be included in essential medicine lists [^115NA1Ef]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2023). High credibility.

Levetiracetam is one ASM that fulfils the "easy to use" criterion. It is rapidly absorbed, unaffected by food, and peak concentrations are quickly achieved. It has linear kinetics, with minimal protein binding, negligible hepatic metabolism, and is renally excreted. Therefore, neither does it have the propensity to clinically relevant drug interactions, nor is its plasma concentration influenced by protein levels. Schedules for commencing treatment are straightforward in comparison to lamotrigine. One issue is that tablets are large and taste bitter in crushed form.

Levetiracetam is available in tablet, oral solution and injectable forms and, therefore, suitable for various circumstances. Recent evidence from the SANAD II trials suggests that it is neither clinically nor cost-effective compared to valproate in generalised epilepsies and lamotrigine in focal epilepsies. Nevertheless, it is widely prescribed for various seizure types and epilepsies, except for absence seizures. There is persuasive evidence for its use as a second-line drug for convulsive status epilepticus. Its efficacy in terms of seizure termination is similar to phenytoin but with a quicker onset, probably related to the speed of its intravenous administration compared to phenytoin.

When used in monotherapy, levetiracetam is less teratogenic than other ASMs, making its use appealing in women in the reproductive age group. Therapeutic drug monitoring, although available, is not routinely required, apart from some situations, e.g. pregnancy, adherence check, intercurrent critical illnesses and extremes of age. Levetiracetam's adverse effect profile is limited, making it further appealing for use in primary care. Behavioural side effects, including irritability, anger and aggression, are the most common. It is prudent to screen for suicidality and psychiatric disorders at treatment initiation bearing in mind, however, that both are raised in epilepsy.

Traditional ASMs are low-priced and often the only drugs available in LMICs. These remain indispensable to practice, especially in primary care settings in LMICs. Their use poses challenges on account of their complexity and long-term consequences. Levetiracetam's cost remains an issue but has lessened with the availability of generics and will likely further reduce if labelled as an essential medicine. The addition of levetiracetam to the Indian list is a commendable step. Other countries should follow suit.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with seizures: approved by the ACEP board of directors, April 17, 2024 [^112tmSuY]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Evidentiary table — intravenous levetiracetam for status epilepticus reports dosing and EEG-based outcomes across small studies. In a chart review, patients who received levetiracetam 20 mg/kg IV for seizures had, in the refractory status epilepticus group, efficacy of 67% (16/24) [95% CI 48% to 86%]. In elderly patients (aged ≥ 65 y) with video EEG-documented status epilepticus loaded with levetiracetam 1,500 mg in ≤ 15 min, 8/9, 89% (95% CI 68% to 100%) had reduction in seizures and in 7/9, 78% (95% CI 51% to 100%) of seizures ceased. In patients with status epilepticus refractory to benzodiazepines given levetiracetam 2,500 mg IV over 5 min, 11 patients were enrolled, with 10 (83% [95% CI 62% to 100%]) having seizures terminate within 24 h, with 1 patient with flushing and 1 patient with unrelated oxygen desaturation. In a chart review of 8 patients who received levetiracetam 20 mg/kg IV for status epilepticus after benzodiazepines, the outcome of termination of seizure activity on EEG within 30 min showed efficacy was 3/8 (38%), 95% CI 4% to 72%.

### Antiseizure medication withdrawal in seizure-free patients: practice advisory update summary: report of the AAN guideline subcommittee [^115JAXGj]. Neurology (2021). High credibility.

American Academy of Neurology (AAN) practice advisory update on antiseizure medication (ASM) withdrawal in seizure-free patients reports that the long-term (24–60 months) risk of seizure recurrence is possibly higher among adults who have been seizure-free for 2 years and taper ASMs vs those who do not taper ASMs (15% vs 7%). In pediatric patients, there is probably no significant difference in seizure recurrence between beginning taper after 2 years vs 4 years of seizure freedom, and there is insufficient evidence of significant difference between tapering after 18 months vs 24 months. Following epilepsy surgery, there is insufficient evidence that the rate of seizure recurrence with ASM withdrawal after 1 year of seizure freedom vs after 4 years is significantly different than maintaining patients on ASMs. An epileptiform EEG in pediatric patients increases the risk of seizure recurrence. In adults, ASM withdrawal possibly does not increase the risk of status epilepticus, and in seizure-free adults, ASM weaning possibly does not change quality of life. In children who are seizure-free, withdrawal at 25% every 10 days to 2 weeks is probably not significantly different from withdrawal at 25% every 2 months in more than 4 years of follow-up. The authors systematically reviewed literature published from January 1991 to March 2020, and fourteen recommendations were developed.

### Non-discontinuation of antiseizure medication in seizure-free epilepsy patients [^116szbhg]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

To summarize, our paper conveys two important findings. First, non‐discontinuation of ASM in long‐term seizure freedom is associated with history of focal to bilateral or generalized tonic–clonic seizures, breakthrough seizures and failed attempt to reduce dose of or discontinue ASM as well as higher current ASM load. As the latter three variables are not part of established scores to estimate seizure relapse risk after discontinuation, further studies are in place to investigate if these factors are in fact associated with an increased recurrence risk. In addition, our study expands previous knowledge on the time dependence of seizure duration to the intervals beyond one decade of seizure freedom. These patients had the highest rate of seizure discontinuation attempts. Thus, there does not seem to be a 'point of no return' after which ASM will not be discontinued. Our results should encourage physicians to engage in discussions regarding the discontinuation of ASM, even after an extended period of continuous medical therapy.

### Antiseizure medication withdrawal in seizure-free patients: practice advisory update summary: report of the AAN guideline subcommittee [^116VoSVk]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To update a 1996 American Academy of Neurology practice parameter.

Methods

The authors systematically reviewed literature published from January 1991 to March 2020.

Results

The long-term (24–60 months) risk of seizure recurrence is possibly higher among adults who have been seizure-free for 2 years and taper antiseizure medications (ASMs) vs those who do not taper ASMs (15% vs 7% per the 1 Class I article addressing this issue). In pediatric patients, there is probably no significant difference in seizure recurrence between those who begin tapering ASMs after 2 years vs 4 years of seizure freedom, and there is insufficient evidence of significant difference in risk of seizure recurrence between those who taper ASMs after 18 months of seizure freedom and those tapering after 24 months. There is insufficient evidence that the rate of seizure recurrence with ASM withdrawal following epilepsy surgery after 1 year of seizure freedom vs after 4 years is not significantly different than maintaining patients on ASMs. An epileptiform EEG in pediatric patients increases the risk of seizure recurrence. ASM withdrawal possibly does not increase the risk of status epilepticus in adults. In seizure-free adults, ASM weaning possibly does not change quality of life. Withdrawal of ASMs at 25% every 10 days to 2 weeks is probably not significantly different from withdrawal at 25% every 2 months in children who are seizure-free in more than 4 years of follow-up.

Recommendations

### Making up missed anti-seizure medication doses: double or nothing? [^114uGuTp]. Epilepsy Currents (2023). Medium credibility.

The other question is whether to take the full missed dose immediately if remembered soon enough. They found that for most ASMs, taking the full missed dose immediately did minimize time outside the desired therapeutic range if taken within a few hours of the missed dose. This makes sense and is in line with the above usual advice. There were just a couple exceptions — for example, clobazam (with its long half-life) was better served by any of the "0.5" or "1.5" dose strategies if a dose is anything more than 1 hour delayed.

Take a typical example — twice daily levetiracetam, assume a 40-year-old adult with normal renal function. Their results endorse some of our typical advice — take the full missed dose immediately if remembered within 2 hours of the scheduled time (our typical advice, strategy B). But if remembered more than 2 hours after the originally scheduled time, their results favored different variations of making up only half of the missed dose (strategies C-F), rather than skipping an entire dose.

They have posted their results in a convenient online format. This allows the user to take matters into their own hands by entering a patient's specific data into this app to view how concentrations may fluctuate under strategies A-F. For more advanced users, they posted another app in which one can even modify assumptions about absorption, clearance, volume of distribution, and more.

Even with their large array of analyses, the investigators could look at only a subset of all possible ASMs or ages (they did not include a scenario for older patients, for whom changes in renal function and susceptibility to adverse effects may be greatest), and these data pertain only to immediate rather than extended-release formulations. There are also 2 elephants in the room: (1) Translating a precise sinusoidal concentration curve into the chance that a patient might have seizures or side effects is not simple, nor does this inform how the patient perceives the tradeoff between transient seizure versus side effect risk, and (2) None of this modeling addresses the underlying cause of skipping doses.

That said, this is a nicely done, useful study, involving incredible technical demands. But what I most appreciate about this study is its spirit. The investigators identified an extremely common clinical scenario with agreed upon yet arbitrary guidance and sought to provide clinicians with freely available evidence-based guideposts.

### Stopping antiepileptic drugs in seizure-free patients [^113u45Uo]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Based on the available evidence, we aim to balance risks and benefits of antiepileptic drug (AED) withdrawal in medically and surgically treated adults and children who achieved remission. We summarize risks and predictors of seizure relapse after AED withdrawal and chances of not regaining seizure freedom. Finally, we discuss how AED discontinuation can inform us on the natural course of the epileptic disorder.

Recent Findings

In medically treated patients, the risk of recurrence after AED withdrawal is increased until 2 years after withdrawal, although long-term seizure outcomes seem to be unaffected by drug policies. Most relapses occur during the first year after withdrawal. Several predictors of postwithdrawal relapse have been identified. The risk of developing uncontrollable epilepsy following withdrawal is less than one in five. Whether AED withdrawal after epilepsy surgery contributes to seizure outcome has never been studied in a randomized controlled manner. Recent studies suggested that AED reduction merely unmasks incomplete surgical success. The risk of not regaining seizure freedom after postoperative relapse is around 30% and probably not affected by AED reduction. Timing of AED discontinuation does not influence eventual seizure outcomes.

Summary

There is no proof that AED withdrawal itself negatively affects long-term seizure outcomes in patients who became seizure-free under AED treatment or after epilepsy surgery. AED discontinuation unveils the natural history of the epilepsy in medically treated patients, and the completeness of resection of the epileptogenic network in patients who underwent epilepsy surgery.

### Levetiracetam add-on for drug-resistant localization related (partial) epilepsy [^116fut3s]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The majority of patients with epilepsy have a good prognosis and their seizures are well controlled by a single antiepileptic drug. However, up to 30% develop refractory seizures, particularly those with partial seizures. In this review, we summarise the current evidence regarding a new antiepileptic drug, levetiracetam, when used as an add-on treatment for drug-resistant localization related (partial) epilepsy.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of levetiracetam on seizures, side effects, quality of life and cognition, when used as an add-on treatment for patients with a drug-resistant localization related (partial) epilepsy.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group trials register, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2000). In addition, we contacted UCB SA (makers of levetiracetam) and experts in the field to seek any ongoing studies or unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized placebo controlled add-on trials of levetiracetam in patients with a drug-resistant localization related (partial) epilepsy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted relevant data. The following outcomes were assessed: (a) 50% or greater reduction in total seizure frequency; (b) treatment withdrawal (any reason); (c) side effects; (d) cognitive effects; (e) quality of life. Primary analyses were intention to treat. Sensitivity best and worst case analyses were also undertaken. Summary odds ratios (ORs) were estimated for each outcome. Dose response was evaluated in regression models.

Main Results

Four trials (1023 patients) were included. All four trials had data for treatment withdrawal and side effect outcomes. Three trials (904 patients) had data for 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency. Three trials (595 patients) had data for quality of life and cognitive outcomes. The overall Odds Ratio (OR) (95% Confidence Interval (CI)) for 50% or greater reduction in total seizure frequency outcome was 3.81 (2.78,5.22). Dose regression analysis shows clear evidence that levetiracetam reduces seizure frequency with an increase in efficacy with increasing dose of levetiracetam. Approximately 15% of patients taking 1000 mg and 20–30% of patients taking 3000 mg levetiracetam per day have a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency. Patients were not significantly more likely to have levetiracetam withdrawn, OR (95% CI) 1.25 (0.87,1.80). The following side effects were significantly associated with levetiracetam: dizziness 2.36 (1.21, 4.61) and infection 1.82 (1.05, 3.14) whereas accidental injury was significantly associated with placebo 0.55 (0.32, 0.93). Quality of life and cognitive effect outcomes suggest that levetiracetam has a positive effect on cognition and some aspects of quality of life.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Levetiracetam reduces seizure frequency when used as an add-on treatment for patients with a drug-resistant localization related (partial) epilepsy, and seems well tolerated. Minimum effective and maximum tolerated doses have not been identified. The trials reviewed were of 16–24 weeks duration and results cannot be used to confirm longer term effects. Our results cannot be extrapolated to monotherapy or to patients with other seizure types or epilepsy syndromes. Great care should also be taken with any attempt to apply these results to children.

5.6	 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitifity

Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including levetiracetam. These events can be fatal or life-threatening, particularly if diagnosis and treatment do not occur as early as possible. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis, sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Levetiracetam should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established [see Contraindications (4)].

5.7 Coordination Difficulties

Levetiracetam may cause coordination difficulties.

In controlled clinical studies in adult patients with partial-onset seizure studies, 3.4% of adult levetiracetam-treated patients experienced coordination difficulties, (reported as either ataxia, abnormal gait, or incoordination) compared to 1.6% of placebo-treated patients. A total of 0.4% of patients in controlled clinical studies discontinued levetiracetam treatment due to ataxia, compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. In 0.7% of levetiracetam-treated patients and in 0.2% of placebo-treated patients, the dose was reduced due to coordination difficulties, while one of the levetiracetam-treated patients was hospitalized due to worsening of pre-existing ataxia. These events occurred most frequently within the first 4 weeks of treatment.

Patients should be monitored for these signs and symptoms and advised not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on levetiracetam to gauge whether it could adversely affect their ability to drive or operate machinery.

5.8 Withdrawal Seizures

As with most antiepileptic drugs, levetiracetam should generally be withdrawn gradually because of the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus. If withdrawal is needed because of a serious adverse reaction, rapid discontinuation can be considered.

### Clinical use and efficacy of levetiracetam for absence epilepsies [^111CdEtc]. Journal of Child Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Levetiracetam is prescribed for a broad spectrum of seizure types but does not have a specific indication for absence epilepsy. We hypothesized that levetiracetam is commonly prescribed for children with absence epilepsies and evaluated the efficacy of this medication for absence epilepsy treatment in clinical practice. We also hypothesized that electroencephalographic (EEG) findings could help predict levetiracetam efficacy.

Methods

We reviewed the charts of all patients treated for new-onset absence epilepsies at our pediatric neurology clinic between January 2011 and January 2016. Among 158 children diagnosed with absence epilepsies, 72 were treated with levetiracetam.

Results

Levetiracetam was discontinued in 74% (n = 53/72) because of incomplete seizure control (59%, n = 35/72) and/or intolerable side effects (41%, n = 24/72) after a median 8.5 months (interquartile range 2, 17 months). Among patients for whom levetiracetam was effective, 44% (n = 8/18) had polyspikes on their initial EEG, versus 27% (n = 14/52) of patients for whom levetiracetam was discontinued (P = 0.17). The maximal prescribed dose was lower for children in whom levetiracetam was effective (29 ± 13 mg/kg/d) than those for whom levetiracetam failed (42 ± 20 mg/kg/d; p = 0.005).

Conclusion

In routine clinical practice, levetiracetam is often chosen for patients with absence seizures. However, only about one-quarter of children with absence epilepsy in this study became seizure free with levetiracetam. When effective, levetiracetam can control absence epilepsy at a relatively low dose. Lack of seizure control requiring continued dose escalation should prompt early consideration of a therapeutic medication transition.

### Evidence-based guideline: management of an unprovoked first seizure in adults: report of the guideline development subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Epilepsy Society [^111PV1kH]. Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Unprovoked first seizure in adults — immediate antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment effects and counseling are as follows: Immediate antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy, as compared with delay of treatment pending a second seizure, is likely to reduce recurrence risk within the first 2 years (Level B) but may not improve quality of life (Level C). Over a longer term (> 3 years), immediate AED treatment is unlikely to improve prognosis as measured by sustained seizure remission (Level B). Patients should be advised that risk of AED adverse events (AEs) may range from 7% to 31% (Level B) and that these AEs are likely predominantly mild and reversible. Clinicians' recommendations whether to initiate immediate AED treatment after a first seizure should be based on individualized assessments that weigh the risk of recurrence against the AEs of AED therapy, consider educated patient preferences, and advise that immediate treatment will not improve the long-term prognosis for seizure remission but will reduce seizure risk over the subsequent 2 years.

### Antiepileptic drug monotherapy for epilepsy: a network meta-analysis of individual participant data [^114MH1QT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Epilepsy is a common neurological condition with a worldwide prevalence of around 1%. Approximately 60% to 70% of people with epilepsy will achieve a longer-term remission from seizures, and most achieve that remission shortly after starting antiepileptic drug treatment. Most people with epilepsy are treated with a single antiepileptic drug (monotherapy) and current guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom for adults and children recommend carbamazepine or lamotrigine as first-line treatment for partial onset seizures and sodium valproate for generalised onset seizures; however a range of other antiepileptic drug (AED) treatments are available, and evidence is needed regarding their comparative effectiveness in order to inform treatment choices.

Objectives

To compare the time to withdrawal of allocated treatment, remission and first seizure of 10 AEDs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, sodium valproate, phenobarbitone, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine, gabapentin, topiramate, levetiracetam, zonisamide) currently used as monotherapy in children and adults with partial onset seizures (simple partial, complex partial or secondary generalised) or generalised tonic-clonic seizures with or without other generalised seizure types (absence, myoclonus).

Search Methods

We searched the following databases: Cochrane Epilepsy's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and SCOPUS, and two clinical trials registers. We handsearched relevant journals and contacted pharmaceutical companies, original trial investigators, and experts in the field. The date of the most recent search was 27 July 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of a monotherapy design in adults or children with partial onset seizures or generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures (with or without other generalised seizure types).

Data Collection and Analysis

This was an individual participant data (IPD) review and network meta-analysis. Our primary outcome was 'time to withdrawal of allocated treatment', and our secondary outcomes were 'time to achieve 12-month remission', 'time to achieve six-month remission', 'time to first seizure post-randomisation', and 'occurrence of adverse events'. We presented all time-to-event outcomes as Cox proportional hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We performed pairwise meta-analysis of head-to-head comparisons between drugs within trials to obtain 'direct' treatment effect estimates and we performed frequentist network meta-analysis to combine direct evidence with indirect evidence across the treatment network of 10 drugs. We investigated inconsistency between direct estimates and network meta-analysis via node splitting. Due to variability in methods and detail of reporting adverse events, we have not performed an analysis. We have provided a narrative summary of the most commonly reported adverse events.

Main Results

IPD was provided for at least one outcome of this review for 12,391 out of a total of 17,961 eligible participants (69% of total data) from 36 out of the 77 eligible trials (47% of total trials). We could not include IPD from the remaining 41 trials in analysis for a variety of reasons, such as being unable to contact an author or sponsor to request data, data being lost or no longer available, cost and resources required to prepare data being prohibitive, or local authority or country-specific restrictions. We were able to calculate direct treatment effect estimates for between half and two thirds of comparisons across the outcomes of the review, however for many of the comparisons, data were contributed by only a single trial or by a small number of participants, so confidence intervals of estimates were wide. Network meta-analysis showed that for the primary outcome 'Time to withdrawal of allocated treatment', for individuals with partial seizures; levetiracetam performed (statistically) significantly better than both current first-line treatments carbamazepine and lamotrigine; lamotrigine performed better than all other treatments (aside from levetiracetam), and carbamazepine performed significantly better than gabapentin and phenobarbitone (high-quality evidence). For individuals with generalised onset seizures, first-line treatment sodium valproate performed significantly better than carbamazepine, topiramate and phenobarbitone (moderate- to high-quality evidence). Furthermore, for both partial and generalised onset seizures, the earliest licenced treatment, phenobarbitone seems to perform worse than all other treatments (moderate- to high-quality evidence). Network meta-analysis also showed that for secondary outcomes 'Time to 12-month remission of seizures' and 'Time to six-month remission of seizures', few notable differences were shown for either partial or generalised seizure types (moderate- to high-quality evidence). For secondary outcome 'Time to first seizure', for individuals with partial seizures; phenobarbitone performed significantly better than both current first-line treatments carbamazepine and lamotrigine; carbamazepine performed significantly better than sodium valproate, gabapentin and lamotrigine. Phenytoin also performed significantly better than lamotrigine (high-quality evidence). In general, the earliest licenced treatments (phenytoin and phenobarbitone) performed better than the other treatments for both seizure types (moderate- to high-quality evidence). Generally, direct evidence and network meta-analysis estimates (direct plus indirect evidence) were numerically similar and consistent with confidence intervals of effect sizes overlapping. The most commonly reported adverse events across all drugs were drowsiness/fatigue, headache or migraine, gastrointestinal disturbances, dizziness/faintness and rash or skin disorders.

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, the high-quality evidence provided by this review supports current guidance (e.g. NICE) that carbamazepine and lamotrigine are suitable first-line treatments for individuals with partial onset seizures and also demonstrates that levetiracetam may be a suitable alternative. High-quality evidence from this review also supports the use of sodium valproate as the first-line treatment for individuals with generalised tonic-clonic seizures (with or without other generalised seizure types) and also demonstrates that lamotrigine and levetiracetam would be suitable alternatives to either of these first-line treatments, particularly for those of childbearing potential, for whom sodium valproate may not be an appropriate treatment option due to teratogenicity.

Effectiveness in Partial-Onset Seizures in Pediatric Patients 1 Month to < 4 Years of Age

The effectiveness of levetiracetam for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in pediatric patients was established in one multicenter, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 5), conducted at 62 sites in North America, South America, and Europe in pediatric patients 1 month to less than 4 years of age with partial seizures, uncontrolled by standard epileptic drugs (AEDs). Eligible patients on a stable dose of 1–2 AEDs, who experienced at least 2 partial-onset seizures during the 48-hour baseline video EEG were randomized to receive either levetiracetam or placebo. The enrolled population included 116 patients (levetiracetam N = 60, placebo N = 56) with refractory partial- onset seizures, whether or not secondarily generalized. Randomization was stratified by age range as follows: 1 month to less than 6 months of age (N = 4 treated with levetiracetam), 6 months to less than 1 year of age (N = 8 treated with levetiracetam), 1 year to less than 2 years of age (N = 20 treated with levetiracetam), and 2 years to less than 4 years of age (N = 28 treated with levetiracetam). The study consisted of a 5-day evaluation period which included a 1-day titration period followed by a 4-day maintenance period. Levetiracetam dosing was determined by age and weight as follows: children 1 month to less than 6 months old were randomized to a target dose of 40 mg/kg/day, and children 6 months to less than 4 years old were randomized to a target dose of 50 mg/kg/day. The primary measure of effectiveness was the responder rate (percent of patients with ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in average daily partial-onset seizure frequency) assessed by a blinded central reader using a 48-hour video EEG performed during the last two days of the 4-day maintenance period. A total of 109 patients were included in the efficacy analysis. A statistically significant difference between levetiracetam and placebo was observed (see Figure 5). The treatment effect associated with levetiracetam was consistent across age groups.

Primary and secondary end‐points

The primary end‐point of our study was non‐discontinuation of ASM (i.e. not discontinuing ASM or not reducing the dose by at least 25%) at the index visit. Our study goal was to identify factors that are associated with the primary end‐point and to analyze rate of non‐discontinuation of ASM according to duration of seizure freedom.

Secondary end‐points were (i) whether the topic of reducing or discontinuing ASM was actually addressed by the treating physician at the index visit (irrespective of the final decision), (ii) whether a shared decision by physician and patient to reduce or discontinue ASM was followed by the patient and (iii) to what extent patients remained seizure‐free after discontinuation of ASM.

### Evidence-based guideline: management of an unprovoked first seizure in adults: report of the guideline development subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Epilepsy Society [^114vjc38]. Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Unprovoked first seizure in adults — risk of recurrence is characterized from pooled prognostic studies showing that generalized tonic–clonic convulsive seizures comprise the major seizure type and that cumulative incidence of recurrence increases over time, with the great majority occurring within the first 1 to 2 years; the greatest risk is in the first year (32% at 1 year), compared with 46% by 5 years. The evidence base included 2 prognostic Class I and 8 prognostic Class II studies. Seizure recurrence was lower for patients treated with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in most of these studies, although treatment often was not randomized, and delays in recruitment by weeks or months may lead to patients experiencing a recurrence and becoming ineligible, contributing to variability and underestimation of recurrence risk.

### Epilepsy therapies symposium | Do we really "Outgrow" seizures? [^1128PHMc]. Epilepsy Currents (2024). Medium credibility.

Initiation and maintenance of antiseizure therapy can be relatively straightforward in most patients. Depending on epilepsy type, patients may be more or less likely to enter remission or a resolution of their epilepsy and the International League Against Epilepsy developed clinically guiding definitions in this regard. The mechanisms by which resolution or remission are achieved are poorly understood which complicates clinical decision making and risk estimate for future seizure relapse. The impetus for the maintenance of medical therapy in a seizure-free patient is also age-dependent. In children, one ought to consider the unknown effects of antiseizure medications on the developing brain while family planning, lifestyle, education, or employment are some of the issues that affect the decision making in adults. Patients who enter remission following surgical remediation of their epilepsy represent a distinct category and medication discontinuation is influenced by a number of factors. Another important consideration is comorbidities that often affect medication choices and maintenance. When formulating a management strategy, patient preferences together with careful evaluation and precise and accurate epilepsy diagnosis are key towards guiding medical or surgical management, prognostication for seizure freedom, relapse risk, options for medication discontinuation, and understanding risks and types of comorbidities.

### Adjunctive levetiracetam in patients aged 1 month to… [^116LdVkj]. Clinical Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

In a recent double-blind, placebo-controlled study, adjunctive levetiracetam (LEV) was reported to be effective and well tolerated during 5-day treatment in patients aged 1 month to < 4 years with partial-onset seizures. A study was planned to fulfill the regulatory requirement to evaluate the long-term safety of LEV as adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures in pediatric patients.

Objective

This study evaluated the long-term effectiveness and tolerability of adjunctive LEV in infants and young children with partial-onset seizures.

Methods

This was a prospective, open-label, outpatient, multicenter study (N01148; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00152516) conducted as an extension of a previously published study (N01009; NCT00175890). Patients were enrolled from 3 sources, as follows: (1) patients who had completed study N01009; (2) patients who had failed screening for entry into study N01009 but fulfilled the eligibility criteria for entry into this study; and (3) patients who were directly enrolled. The study consisted of a 2- to 4-week retrospective baseline period (and a 3- to 10-day prospective baseline period for directly enrolled patients), a 2- to 8-week uptitration/conversion period, and a maintenance period. Eligible patients were required to have epilepsy with partial-onset seizures, treated with a stable regimen of 1 or 2 antiepileptic drugs. Patients received adjunctive LEV, 20 to 80 mg/kg/d, for up to 48 weeks (total study duration). The primary variable for effectiveness was the percentage reduction from baseline in the weekly frequency of partial-onset seizures, as recorded in patients' diaries. Data for effectiveness were also analyzed by age strata (1 month to < 1 year, 1 to < 2 years, and 2 to < 4 years). Neuropsychological assessment was conducted with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Second Edition (BSID-II). All analyses were performed on observed data, and the last-observation-carried-forward approach was not used. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population was defined as all patients who took at least one dose of LEV during the study. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were assessed by observation, spontaneous reporting, standard questions, review of diary cards, and neuropsychologists' clinical reports. Additional measures included physical and neurologic examinations, vital signs, ECGs, routine blood chemistry, and routine hematology assessments.

Results

The study included 152 patients in the ITT population. In total, 51.3% (78/152) of the patients were male, and mean (SD) age was 23.5 (12.4) months. The mean LEV maintenance dose was 56.1 (16.2) mg/kg/d, and the median (Q1-Q3) treatment duration was 287.8 (209.0–295.5) days. Ninety-seven patients (63.8%) completed the study. The BSID-II subpopulation included 51 patients. During maintenance, the overall median (Q1-Q3) percentage reduction from baseline in the weekly frequency of partial-onset seizures was 56.0% (-10.9% to 92.8%), which was sustained over time and appeared comparable across the age strata (1 month to < 1 year, n = 25, 50.9%; 1 to < 2 years, n = 48, 58.0%; and 2 to < 4 years, n = 59, 55.0%). The overall responder rate (ie, ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in weekly partial-onset seizures) was 53.8% (71/132), was maintained over time, and was consistent across the age strata (1 month to < 1 year, 52.0%; 1 to < 2 years, 56.3%; and 2 to < 4 years, 52.5%). Mean BSID-II raw scores for psychomotor development and behavioral functioning remained static, whereas mental development appeared to improve over time, although this was not tested statistically. At least one TEAE was reported in 143 patients (94.1%). The most frequently reported TEAEs were pyrexia (60/152; 39.5%), upper respiratory tract infection (42/152; 27.6%), and vomiting (28/152; 18.4%). The most common TEAEs affecting the central nervous system were convulsion (25/152; 16.4%), irritability (19/152; 12.5%), and somnolence (16/152; 10.5%). Most TEAEs (77.0%) were mild or moderate in intensity.

Conclusion

Adjunctive LEV treatment for up to 48 weeks was associated with effective and sustained seizure control and had an acceptable tolerability profile in this small, selected population of infants and young children aged 1 month to < 4 years with partial-onset seizures.

Clinical Question In patients with a history of epilepsy, how long must one be seizure-free before stopping antiepileptic drug therapy. Evidence-Based Answer Children with epilepsy should be seizure-free for at least two years before stopping antiepileptic drug therapy, especially those who have partial seizures or a history of abnormal electroencephalography results. Evidence is insufficient to guide this decision for children with generalized seizures, and there is no evidence with which to answer this question for adults. Practice Pointers Patients sometimes present to their family physician requesting discontinuation of their seizure medication, yet doing so prematurely can be harmful.

A detailed history is important to establish whether seizures were focal or generalized, and whether consciousness was impaired. Attempts should be made to retrieve EEG or imaging study results. Furthermore, some patients may have had nonepileptic seizures or seizures provoked by a resolved stimulus. 1 The authors of this Cochrane review assessed the risk of discontinuing antiepileptic drug therapy in children and adults with true epilepsy. They defined epilepsy as two or more unprovoked seizures at least 24 hours apart, one seizure with very high risk of recurrence because of an underlying condition, or a diagnosis of epilepsy syndrome. Four of the trials were conducted in affluent European countries, and one took place in Ethiopia. Blinding of groups was not considered feasible or ethical.

The studies lasted from six months to seven years and included an initial taper of antiepileptic drugs over one month to one year. Overall, late withdrawal of antiepileptic drugs decreased the risk of seizure relapse. Other factors that increased the risk of seizures included diagnosis of seizure disorder before two years or after 10 years of age, history of status epilepticus, an intellectual disability, and a high seizure frequency before and during treatment. Only one trial included patients with generalized seizures; no conclusion could be reached regarding risk of relapse. In 1994, the American Academy of Neurology published guidelines recommending discontinuation of antiepileptic drug therapy if the following criteria are met: seizure-free for two to five years, only one type of epilepsy, normal EEG findings, and normal neurologic examination findings.
