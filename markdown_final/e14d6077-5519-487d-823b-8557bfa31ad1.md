## Question

How do environmental toxins contribute to the development of ADHD?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how environmental toxins contribute to the development of ADHD. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the multifactorial etiology of ADHD and where environmental toxins fit. Then, I should identify which specific toxins have the most consistent evidence and why they are biologically plausible. Next, I will examine developmental timing and sensitive windows, followed by mechanistic pathways such as neurotransmitter disruption, thyroid interference, oxidative stress, and epigenetics. After that, I need to consider gene–environment interactions and cumulative or mixture effects. Finally, I should weigh evidence limitations and translate this into practical prevention and clinical implications, while double-checking areas where causality remains uncertain.

> Let me first confirm the foundational frame: ADHD is a multifactorial neurodevelopmental disorder with high heritability, but a meaningful portion of risk is non-genetic, and no single factor is necessary or sufficient, which means environmental toxins likely act as contributors within a broader causal architecture rather than sole causes [^11524h9e] [^114BiHPL].

> I will now examine which environmental toxins have the most consistent associations. Lead repeatedly shows associations with ADHD diagnosis and symptoms in multiple datasets, with effect sizes around 1.6–2.6 in meta-analyses and case-control studies, and there is a dose–response pattern even at low levels, though I should be cautious about residual confounding and exposure timing [^115GeeCX] [^114nCrKW] [^114yQtp2]. Organophosphate pesticides also show reproducible associations with ADHD-related behaviors in prospective cohorts and reviews, and animal models support biological plausibility, which strengthens inference even if causality is not fully established in humans [^112A6Kfq]. Phthalates and other endocrine-disrupting chemicals show associations in adolescence as well as prenatal periods, suggesting windows beyond early life, though replication and mechanistic work are still evolving [^116hGrYJ] [^116pb4fD]. Manganese exposure, particularly via drinking water, has emerging links to inattentive-type ADHD, with sex-specific effects in some cohorts, which I should keep in mind as a potentially modifiable exposure in certain communities [^115mvdJv]. Legacy organohalogens like PCBs have long-standing evidence for attention and executive function deficits, consistent with thyroid-disrupting properties during brain development [^116zzrfJ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about timing; I need to check which windows confer the greatest vulnerability. Prenatal and early postnatal periods are high-sensitivity phases for neurodevelopment, and exposures during these windows are more consistently linked to later ADHD phenotypes than exposures later in childhood, although adolescence may represent a secondary window for some endocrine disruptors like phthalates [^113J2tdL] [^116hGrYJ]. Let me verify examples: prenatal tobacco exposure measured by cotinine shows a dose–response with offspring ADHD, and prenatal polysubstance use demonstrates additive risk, reinforcing the importance of gestational timing and cumulative burden [^112KcnpK] [^112nbrdL].

> Next, I should review mechanisms to ensure biological plausibility. Neurotransmitter pathway disruption is a recurring theme: lead and other metals can impair dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems central to ADHD pathophysiology, while PCBs and some pesticides interfere with thyroid hormone signaling, which is crucial for cortical maturation and attention circuits [^116zzrfJ] [^114nCrKW]. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are plausible downstream effects of metal exposures, and epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation changes in response to prenatal acetaminophen or other exposures provide a mechanistic bridge from environment to durable neural programming, though I should confirm that epigenetic findings are not yet definitive for ADHD causality [^111ipeFC] [^115nJDqY] [^114dvJRy].

> Wait, let me verify the role of gene–environment interplay, because this is easy to misattribute. Genetic liability shapes both exposure propensity and susceptibility to environmental risks, so observed associations can reflect gene–environment correlation or interaction rather than pure environmental causation; maternal ADHD polygenic risk, for example, correlates with smoking and acetaminophen use in pregnancy, complicating causal inference for offspring ADHD [^111ZMqfH] [^112mGNt4]. I should double-check that some prenatal exposures, like maternal smoking, show attenuated or null effects when familial and genetic confounding is addressed, underscoring the need for triangulation across designs such as negative controls, sibling comparisons, and Mendelian randomization [^113JGA77] [^111T5ZcH].

> I need to ensure I consider cumulative and mixture effects, since real-world exposures are rarely isolated. Additive risk from multiple substances is evident in polysubstance exposure cohorts, and there are concerning interactions, for example opioids combined with cannabis or tobacco yielding higher-than-expected ADHD risk, which suggests synergistic toxicity or correlated high-risk environments [^112nbrdL] [^113z9tsb]. But wait, what if we are underestimating mixture effects? Current risk frameworks often evaluate single chemicals, yet the developing brain may be affected by cumulative impacts of multiple low-level neurotoxicants, arguing for a shift toward mixture risk assessment in developmental neurotoxicology [^1125uM29].

> Let me reconsider the strength of evidence and where I might be overstating causality. For lead, the consistency across populations, dose–response gradients, and coherence with animal models make a causal contribution highly plausible, and population-attributable fractions suggest meaningful prevention potential even at contemporary exposure levels [^115GeeCX] [^113f672i]. For organophosphates, converging human epidemiology and controlled animal data support a causal role, though residual confounding remains possible in some human studies [^112A6Kfq]. For acetaminophen, associations appear in several cohorts and an umbrella review, but genetically informed analyses suggest maternal liability may confound the exposure–outcome link, so I should be cautious about inferring causality pending triangulation [^114TeChy] [^111ZMqfH]. For air pollution, associations with ADHD and related behaviors are growing, but heterogeneity and indirect exposure assessment in many studies temper causal inference at this time [^113J2tdL].

> I should double-check clinical and public health implications so recommendations are proportionate to evidence. Primary prevention via reduction of lead hazards, minimizing pesticide exposures in pregnancy and early childhood, and avoiding tobacco smoke exposure are reasonable, evidence-aligned strategies with potential to lower ADHD risk at the population level, especially given the absence of a safe threshold for lead neurotoxicity and the additive risks seen with polysubstance exposure [^113f672i] [^112nbrdL]. Clinically, in children with ADHD and a plausible toxicant exposure history, integrating environmental screening and counseling into care is appropriate, while recognizing that most cases reflect multifactorial etiology and that exposure reduction is a complement, not a substitute, for evidence-based ADHD treatment [^113xhy87] [^11524h9e].

> In summary, environmental toxins contribute to ADHD risk through converging pathways that disrupt neurotransmission, thyroid signaling, and neurodevelopmental programming, with the strongest and most consistent evidence for lead, organophosphate pesticides, and certain endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Timing matters, with prenatal and early postnatal windows appearing most sensitive. And risk is shaped by gene–environment interplay and cumulative exposures, so prevention efforts focused on reducing modifiable toxicant exposures during critical windows are a rational and potentially impactful strategy while causality research continues to mature [^115GeeCX] [^116hGrYJ] [^113J2tdL].

Environmental toxins contribute to ADHD through **prenatal and early-life exposures** that disrupt neurodevelopment, especially in the prefrontal cortex and dopaminergic pathways [^114nCrKW]. Lead, mercury, PCBs, organophosphate pesticides, and endocrine-disrupting chemicals (phthalates, BPA) are the most consistently linked exposures, with **lead showing the strongest evidence** [^115GeeCX] [^111PhynH]. Mechanisms include neurotransmitter dysregulation, oxidative stress, and epigenetic changes, and **risk is amplified by gene–environment interactions** and cumulative exposures [^114dvJRy] [^1125uM29]. Reducing these exposures — particularly during pregnancy and early childhood — is a key, modifiable pathway to lower ADHD risk [^116n1my9].

## Biological mechanisms linking environmental toxins to ADHD

Environmental toxins affect neurodevelopment through several **interconnected mechanisms**:

- **Neurotransmitter dysregulation**: Toxins like lead and organophosphates disrupt dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin systems, central to ADHD pathophysiology [^114nCrKW] [^116zzrfJ].

- **Oxidative stress**: Heavy metals and pesticides induce oxidative stress, damaging neurons and altering brain development [^111ipeFC].

- **Epigenetic modifications**: Toxin exposure can alter gene expression via DNA methylation and histone modification, affecting neurodevelopmental pathways [^114dvJRy] [^115nJDqY].

- **Neuroanatomical alterations**: Prenatal exposure to substances like nicotine and alcohol is associated with reduced brain volumes, particularly in the cerebellum and prefrontal cortex, regions implicated in ADHD [^114RjXJc] [^112ojC9G].

---

## Timing and duration of exposure

The timing and duration of exposure **significantly influence risk**. Prenatal and early postnatal periods are critical windows of neurodevelopmental vulnerability; exposures during these periods have lasting effects on brain structure and function [^113J2tdL]. Chronic, low-level exposures are particularly concerning because they can cause cumulative damage over time [^113f672i].

---

## Gene–environment interactions

Genetic predisposition significantly modulates susceptibility to environmental toxins. Polymorphisms in genes regulating neurotransmitters (e.g. DRD4, DAT1) and detoxification pathways (e.g. GSTP1) interact with toxin exposure, amplifying ADHD risk [^114jtZPA]. These interactions help explain individual variability in susceptibility to environmental toxins.

---

## Cumulative and synergistic effects

Children are often exposed to multiple toxins simultaneously, leading to **cumulative and synergistic effects** that exceed the sum of individual exposures [^1125uM29]. Combined exposures to lead and prenatal tobacco smoke, for example, significantly increase ADHD risk compared to either exposure alone [^116n1my9].

---

## Preventive strategies and public health implications

Given the strong evidence linking environmental toxins to ADHD, **preventive strategies are essential**:

- **Regulatory policies**: Stricter regulations on lead, pesticides, and endocrine-disrupting chemicals can reduce exposure [^115GeeCX].

- **Public health campaigns**: Education on avoiding exposure during pregnancy and early childhood is critical [^115qnVs3].

- **Environmental remediation**: Cleaning up contaminated sites and improving housing conditions can reduce exposure risks [^notfound].

---

Environmental toxins contribute to ADHD through prenatal and early-life exposures that disrupt neurodevelopment. Lead, mercury, PCBs, organophosphate pesticides, and endocrine-disrupting chemicals are key culprits, with **mechanisms including neurotransmitter dysregulation, oxidative stress, and epigenetic changes** [^115GeeCX]. Risk is modulated by genetic susceptibility and cumulative exposures, underscoring the need for preventive strategies and policy interventions [^114jtZPA] [^1125uM29].

### Association between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and future risk of attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children [^111F1cVw]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of prenatal acetaminophen exposure on the future development of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children.

Data Sources

Literature searches of MEDLINE (1975 to June 2015), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1975 to June 2015), and Cochrane Database (publications through June 2015) for prospective clinical trials assessing the relationship of prenatal acetaminophen exposure and the development of attention deficit disorders or hyperactivity.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Studies comparing self-reported maternal acetaminophen use during pregnancy to development of ADHD or ADHD-like behaviors in offspring between the ages of 3 and 12 years.

Data Synthesis

Four studies examining the effects of prenatal acetaminophen exposure on subsequent ADHD behaviors were identified. Of these, one early study found no link to ADHD behaviors while the other studies found statistically significant correlations with the most prominent being a study finding a higher risk for using ADHD medications (hazard ratio = 1.29; 95% CI, 1.15–1.44) or having ADHD-like behaviors at age 7 years as determined by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (risk ratio = 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01–1.27) in children whose mothers used acetaminophen during pregnancy.

Conclusion

While there does appear to be a mild correlation between prenatal acetaminophen use and the development of ADHD symptoms in children, current data do not provide sufficient evidence that prenatal acetaminophen exposure leads to development of ADHD symptoms late in life. Acetaminophen is a preferred option for pain management during pregnancy when compared with other medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or opioids for pyretic or pain relief.

### Neurotoxicity of polychlorinated biphenyls and related organohalogens [^116zzrfJ]. Acta Neuropathologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Halogenated organic compounds are pervasive in natural and built environments. Despite restrictions on the production of many of these compounds in most parts of the world through the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), many "legacy" compounds, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), are routinely detected in human tissues where they continue to pose significant health risks to highly exposed and susceptible populations. A major concern is developmental neurotoxicity, although impacts on neurodegenerative outcomes have also been noted. Here, we review human studies of prenatal and adult exposures to PCBs and describe the state of knowledge regarding outcomes across domains related to cognition (e.g. IQ, language, memory, learning), attention, behavioral regulation and executive function, and social behavior, including traits related to attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). We also review current understanding of molecular mechanisms underpinning these associations, with a focus on dopaminergic neurotransmission, thyroid hormone disruption, calcium dyshomeostasis, and oxidative stress. Finally, we briefly consider contemporary sources of organohalogens that may pose human health risks via mechanisms of neurotoxicity common to those ascribed to PCBs.

### Blood lead concentrations and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in Korean children: a hospital-based case control study [^113FWLPD]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This hospital-based case-control study demonstrated that even low blood lead concentration is also a risk factor for ADHD in children. The environmental risk factors for ADHD have meaningful implications for prevention because they are easier to modify than genetic factors. The current consensus is that there is no safe threshold for neurotoxic lead exposure. The findings of our study emphasize the importance of public health policies that reduce the environmental lead exposure. Future studies may be required to ascertain the effects of lead on the symptom severity of ADHD.

### Prenatal risk factors and the etiology of ADHD-review of existing evidence [^116byrdN]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2017). Low credibility.

While it is well accepted that attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly heritable disorder, not all of the risk is genetic. It is estimated that between 10 and 40% of the variance associated with ADHD is likely to be accounted for by environmental factors. There is considerable interest in the role that the prenatal environment might play in the development of ADHD with previous reviews concluding that despite demonstration of associations between prenatal risk factors (e.g. prematurity, maternal smoking during pregnancy) and ADHD, there remains insufficient evidence to support a definite causal relationship. This article provides an update of research investigating the relationship between prenatal risk factors and ADHD published over the past 3 years. Recently, several epidemiological and data linkage studies have made substantial contributions to our understanding of this relationship. In particular, these studies have started to account for some of the genetic and familial confounds that, when taken into account, throw several established findings into doubt. None of the proposed prenatal risk factors can be confirmed as causal for ADHD, and the stronger the study design, the less likely it is to support an association. We need a new benchmark for studies investigating the etiology of ADHD whereby there is an expectation not only that data will be collected prospectively but also that the design allows the broad range of genetic and familial factors to be accounted for.

### Air pollution and neurological development in children [^113J2tdL]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy and early childhood are periods with high plasticity in neurological development. Environmental perturbations during these sensitive windows can have lifelong developmental consequences. This review summarizes key findings relevant to the effects of air pollution on neurological development. Mounting evidence suggests that exposure to air pollution, both during pregnancy and childhood, is associated with childhood developmental outcomes ranging from changes in brain structures to subclinical deficits in developmental test scores, and, ultimately, developmental disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders or autism spectrum disorders. Although the biological mechanisms of effects remain to be elucidated, multiple pathways are probably involved and include oxidative stress, inflammation, and/or endocrine disruption. Given the alarming global increase in developmental disorders in recent years, and increased human exposures to pollution, it is critical to reduce personal and community-level exposures through tight collaboration of interdisciplinary and multi-level bodies including community partners, physicians, industry partners, policy makers, public health practitioners, and researchers. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Exposure to air pollution is associated with a range of childhood developmental complications. Biological mechanisms may include oxidative stress, inflammation, and endocrine disruption.

### What causes attention deficit hyperactivity disorder? [^113raHNh]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, there is strong evidence of an inherited contribution to ADHD, although non-inherited factors that likely include environmental risks and chance events (including de novo genetic changes) are also important. There is no single cause of ADHD and the risk factors that have been identified so far appear to be non-specific. That is, risks such as chromosomal microdeletions (eg, VCFS), large, rare CNVs, extreme low birth weight and prematurity appear to affect a range of different neurodevelopmental and psychiatric phenotypes. Genetic risks likely also include multiple common gene variants of small effect size that have yet to be identified, with the possible exception of a few dopaminergic genes. With the costs of DNA sequencing dropping, there is likely to be an increasing focus on identifying rare genetic variants, including structural variants such as CNVs and other rare mutations with larger risk effects.

Despite the rapid advances in genetics, there is still a need for further research into environmental risks. Although many factors are associated with ADHD, different designs are needed to test which are causal. The strongest evidence relates to the links between ADHD/ADHD-like behaviours and relatively rare extreme adversities, specifically extreme prematurity, very low birth weight, foetal alcohol syndrome and a pattern of behaviours associated with institutional deprivation in the early years. Less is known about risk factors that modify ADHD outcomes. One exception is the association between COMT and antisocial behaviour in ADHD that is well replicated now and highlights that behavioural problems in those with ADHD may have different origins to behavioural problems in general.

Cumulatively, the available evidence goes some way towards highlighting groups who are at higher risk; specifically those who have a family history of ADHD and/or neurodevelopmental or learning problems, and those who have been exposed to the environmental adversities described earlier. However, none of these risks, including the genetic ones, provide tests or biomarkers of ADHD. It is hoped that, in the future, improved identification of ADHD risk factors and pathways will increase our understanding of the as yet unknown pathogenesis of ADHD and pave the way for improving diagnosis and treatment.

### Association of maternal neurodevelopmental risk alleles with early-life exposures [^111T5ZcH]. JAMA Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Neurodevelopmental disorders involve atypical brain development affecting domains such as language, motor skills, social communication, attention, activity regulation, and learning. This group of disorders includes attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and is sometimes broadened to encompass schizophrenia (SCZ) because its onset is often preceded by neurodevelopmental impairments. Neurodevelopmental disorders are highly heritable (60%-90%), although they are associated with a combination of multiple genetic, environmental, and stochastic factors.

Prenatal and perinatal exposures to adversities have long been considered to be possible risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders and are biologically plausible as causal risks because they occur during a sensitive time in neurodevelopment. Prenatal factors linked with neurodevelopmental disorders include smoking, alcohol intake, nutritional deficiencies (eg, vitamin D), poor nutrition, nonuse of nutritional supplements (eg, folic acid), medication use (eg, acetaminophen [paracetamol], antidepressants), prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), age at delivery, metabolic disorders (eg, diabetes, preeclampsia), immune-related conditions (eg, infection, autoimmune diseases), depression, stressful life events, and toxin levels (eg, mercury, lead). Adverse perinatal factors (eg, low birth weight, prematurity, cesarean delivery) have been shown to be associated with all 3 neurodevelopmental disorders. However, with some exceptions, most of these studies were observational and are therefore not appropriate for assessing causality.

Confounding by sometimes unknown lifestyle, socioeconomic, or genetic factors can lead to apparent associations between early-life factors and neurodevelopmental outcomes that are not causal. Potential genetic confounding is particularly important for factors such as maternal smoking, which is known to be associated with maternal genotype. Other factors such as birth weight are associated with maternal and fetal genotypes. If genetic factors are independently associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and early-life exposures (horizontal pleiotropy), then associations could arise for noncausal reasons. For example, of 12 studies using different causally informative designs, such as discordant sibling pairs, maternal vs paternal exposures, an assisted conception cohort, and children of twins,11 showed that maternal smoking in pregnancy does not appear to have a causal effect on ADHD, although it has an effect on lowering birth weight. However, such designs have not been able to address the full range of prenatal and perinatal risks.

### Prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke or alcohol and cerebellum volume in attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder and typical development [^117QfEgX]. Translational Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Behavioral genetic studies have recently suggested that the effect of prenatal exposure to teratogenic substances on the development of behavioral problems may be largely genetically mediated rather than caused by exposure per se. These results could be taken to suggest gene × environment interaction (G × E), but have generally been interpreted as more convergent with G × E correlations or pleiotropic effects of genes related to both ADHD and substance use. Indeed, the currently available evidence does not suggest a large role for G × E, but rather suggests additive effects of risk genes and prenatal exposure. One important implication of these studies is that they suggest that detecting the effect of an environmental risk factor in isolation is likely to be difficult.

This study is a naturalistic study of the effects of self-reported maternal smoking and alcohol use during pregnancy on global brain volumes in children with ADHD and typically developing controls. We compared brain measures derived from anatomical magnetic resonance imaging scans from subjects with ADHD who had been prenatally exposed to cigarettes or alcohol to those from subjects with ADHD who had not, and to those from typically developing controls who also did not have a history of prenatal exposure. Given the results from behavioral genetic studies, we hypothesized a stepwise pattern where we expected the largest volumes for typically developing controls, followed by subjects with ADHD who had not been exposed to teratogenic substances prenatally, and smallest volumes for subjects with ADHD who had. We expected this pattern to be most pronounced for cerebellum, given its hypothesized increased vulnerability to prenatal exposure to teratogenic substances. To investigate the specificity of these results to ADHD, we conducted a second analysis where we compared brain volumes from typically developing controls who had been exposed prenatally to controls who had not. Here, we hypothesized that we would find similar effects of exposure on brain volume, but that these would be attenuated in magnitude compared with the effects for children with ADHD and prenatal exposure.

### Urinary trichlorophenol levels and increased risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder among US school-aged children [^113rq1ef]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Several potential limitations should be considered when interpreting the results of our study. First, although the use of urine as a matrix to determine biomarkers of exposure is especially suitable for compounds such as TCPs and other metabolites, urinary levels may reflect recent exposure. In addition, the large variation in TCP levels between data cycles suggests data errors during testing and/or data processing unless urinary TCPs varied greatly between different cycles. Second, since this is a cross-sectional study, we cannot interpret our results as providing evidence of a causal relationship between early exposure to TCPs and subsequent risk of developing ADHD. Third, ascertainment of ADHD was solely based on parental report without confirmation of diagnosis through medical record abstraction or administration of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). Administration of the DSM would provide information on ADHD subtypes and behavioural symptom counts, and increase specificity in detecting behavioural problems. Although data from the DSM-based ADHD diagnostic instruments are available in NHANES, there is limited access to this information. In addition, misclassification of ADHD from parental report would mostly likely result in underestimation of the true association between TCPs and ADHD. Future prospective cohort studies with better measures of TCP exposure and better ascertainment of ADHD are needed to validate our findings. Fourth, the data available on covariates such as socioeconomic status and early childhood factors were obtained through personal interview of a proxy respondent of a child's family and may be inaccurate. Finally, although many important covariates and potential confounders were included in our analysis, we were unable to adjust for the potential effects of other important covariates including parental education, breastfeeding, genetic factors, psychosocial stressors, other prenatal and/or postnatal environmental factors such as prenatal alcohol drinking, exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls, dioxins, phthalate and bisphenol A, and parental psychopathology.

Nevertheless, our results suggest that exposure to organochlorine compounds may be associated with increased risk of ADHD among school-aged children. Our findings underscore the potential behavioural health effects of these chemicals and highlight the need to strengthen public health efforts to reduce prenatal and postnatal exposure to these compounds, especially in countries where organochlorine pesticides are still commonly used.

### Environmental risk factors, protective factors, and peripheral biomarkers for ADHD: an umbrella review [^114TeChy]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Background

Many potential environmental risk factors, environmental protective factors, and peripheral biomarkers for ADHD have been investigated, but the consistency and magnitude of their effects are unclear. We aimed to systematically appraise the published evidence of association between potential risk factors, protective factors, or peripheral biomarkers, and ADHD.

Methods

In this umbrella review of meta-analyses, we searched PubMed including MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, from database inception to Oct 31, 2019, and screened the references of relevant articles. We included systematic reviews that provided meta-analyses of observational studies that examined associations of potential environmental risk factors, environmental protective factors, or peripheral biomarkers with diagnosis of ADHD. We included meta-analyses that used categorical ADHD diagnosis criteria according to DSM, hyperkinetic disorder according to ICD, or criteria that were less rigorous than DSM or ICD, such as self-report. We excluded articles that did not examine environmental risk factors, environmental protective factors, or peripheral biomarkers of ADHD; articles that did not include a meta-analysis; and articles that did not present enough data for re-analysis. We excluded non-human studies, primary studies, genetic studies, and conference abstracts. We calculated summary effect estimates (odds ratio [OR], relative risk [RR], weighted mean difference [WMD], Cohen's d, and Hedges' g), 95% CI, heterogeneity I² statistic, 95% prediction interval, small study effects, and excess significance biases. We did analyses under credibility ceilings, and assessed the quality of the meta-analyses with AMSTAR 2 (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews 2). This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42019145032.

Findings

We identified 1839 articles, of which 35 were eligible for inclusion. These 35 articles yielded 63 meta-analyses encompassing 40 environmental risk factors and environmental protective factors (median cases 16850, median population 91954) and 23 peripheral biomarkers (median cases 175, median controls 187). Evidence of association was convincing (class I) for maternal pre-pregnancy obesity (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.49 to 1.77), childhood eczema (1.31, 1.20 to 1.44), hypertensive disorders during pregnancy (1.29, 1.22 to 1.36), pre-eclampsia (1.28, 1.21 to 1.35), and maternal acetaminophen exposure during pregnancy (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.34). Evidence of association was highly suggestive (class II) for maternal smoking during pregnancy (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.45 to 1.76), childhood asthma (1.51, 1.4 to 1.63), maternal pre-pregnancy overweight (1.28, 1.21 to 1.35), and serum vitamin D (WMD -6.93, 95% CI -9.34 to -4.51).

Interpretation

Maternal pre-pregnancy obesity and overweight; pre-eclampsia, hypertension, acetaminophen exposure, and smoking during pregnancy; and childhood atopic diseases were strongly associated with ADHD. Previous familial studies suggest that maternal pre-pregnancy obesity, overweight, and smoking during pregnancy are confounded by familial or genetic factors, and further high-quality studies are therefore required to establish causality.

### Building the evidence to treat preschoolers with ADHD in real-life settings [^1143VYXu]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Abundant evidence indicates that attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has its roots in the early stages of development. Genetic risk plays a major influence and interacts with a variety of environmental exposures in complex dynamic ways, leading to heterogeneous neurobiological processes that eventually emerge clinically. 1 The heterogeneity of etiological mechanisms is reflected by a heterogeneous clinical constellation and trajectories of symptoms and associated disorders. One common developmental trajectory of ADHD is the onset during the preschool age, with stability of approximately 90% to school age in clinical samples. 2.

### Blood lead concentrations and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in Korean children: a hospital-based case control study [^114nCrKW]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent and developmentally inappropriate expressions of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. ADHD is the most common neurodevelopmental disorder in childhood, with a worldwide prevalence of approximately 5%. Both genetic and environmental factors are involved in the etiology of ADHD. There is robust evidence for the strong inheritance of ADHD, with a genetic heritability of approximately 75%. However, the environmental risk factors for ADHD, which constitute 25% of the etiology of ADHD, remain unclear.

Among the environmental factors that are suspected to be associated with ADHD, lead exposure has been implicated in the etiology of ADHD. Lead is a neurotoxic heavy metal that is widely present in the environment. Common sources of lead exposure include lead-based paint from buildings and toys, vehicle exhaust fumes, water from leaded pipes, secondhand smoke, and air pollution. Because the nervous systems of children are more vulnerable than those of adults to the neurotoxic effects of lead, even low levels of lead can affect neurodevelopment in children. Children absorb lead more readily than adults, and lead crosses the blood-brain barrier more easily in children. Some studies documented a link between lead and ADHD pathophysiology. The brain regions that are most vulnerable to lead exposure are the prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Dysfunctions of these regions have been postulated to be involved in ADHD pathophysiology. Findings from animal studies have demonstrated that lead exposure affect dopamine metabolism and decrease dopamine receptor binding in the striatum. Reduced dopamine activity in striatum has been implicated in the core symptoms of ADHD. Overall, these studies revealed that lead adversely affects the dopamine system in the prefrontal-striatal network, which is linked to the core pathophysiology of ADHD.

### Early exposure to general anaesthesia and increasing trends in developmental behavioural impairments: is there a link? [^111qXZmP]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Over the past two decades there has been an increase in reports of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder and perhaps autism spectrum disorder that appear to coincide with a substantial number of general anaesthesia interventions during early stages of human brain development. Is there a link between anaesthesia exposure and neurocognitive effects considering the growing body of evidence in numerous animal species, including humans, that suggests long-lasting socio-affective behavioural impairments after early exposure to general anaesthesia? Could routinely used general anaesthetics contribute as environmental toxins? Here we present the case that this notion is worthy of further consideration.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1–2% of all children born in Europe, North America and other developed regions, and is defined by persistent alterations in social communication and interaction alongside restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviour, interests or activities. ASD causes significant impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning. Psychiatric comorbidity is common, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), affecting up to 30% of children with ASD. Heritable factors account for at least 50% of ASD risk with the remainder attributable to environmental factors acting alone or through interaction with genetics. While substantial progress has been made in identifying genetic determinants of autism riskenvironmental factors, especially modifiable environmental exposures, remain understudied.

Fetal and early childhood exposure to toxic metals and deficiencies of nutritional elements have been linked with several adverse developmental outcomes frequently associated with ASD, including intellectual disability, and language, attentional and behavioural problems. Animal studies have demonstrated that the effects of various metals on brain development could be mediated through dysregulation in neurotransmission, and alterations in frontal and subcortical brain structures, several of which have also been implicated in ASD. Therefore, environmental and dietary exposure to metals are potentially important etiological factors in ASD.

### Early life programming as a target for prevention of child and adolescent mental disorders [^113f672i]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Environmental teratogens and neurodevelopmental toxicants differ from the above by the locus of control of the mother with respect to exposure, but are nevertheless an important modifiable risk factor for preventative mental health strategies. Lead exposure is the prototypic environmental neurotoxicant. Historical exposure was through use of lead in water pipes carrying drinking water, as a fuel additive, and in paints and certain toys. Lead persists in the environment and current household exposure is understood to be primarily from historical soil contamination and old paint, although lead does also continue to be used in a restricted form in hobby activities including soldering, pottery, collectables such as toy soldiers, certain artists' paints, ammunition and fishing sinkers. Large longitudinal studies demonstrate that prenatal, lifetime and current exposure are each important for neurodevelopmental outcomes. The proposed biological mechanisms have supportive in vitro evidence, including inhibition of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid glutamate receptors (the key molecule regulating synaptic long-term potentiation) and interaction with calcium ion signaling, with much wider implications. Although much research has focused upon outcomes of general cognitive ability and/or ADHD, there is well-replicated evidence for an association between lead exposure and adverse outcomes across broad ranging neurodevelopmental outcomes, including both behavioral and emotional symptomatology. The effect size is substantial. Froehlich et al. estimate that in the US, 25.4% of ADHD in 8- to 15-year-olds is attributable to the low levels of exposure that persist today. Their analysis used data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) study, a cross-sectional study but whose design facilitates it having the statistical power to look at clinical outcomes rather than symptomatology.

### Association of prenatal, early postnatal, or current exposure to secondhand smoke with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder symptoms in children [^115qnVs3]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are there associations between prenatal, early postnatal, or current exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) and symptoms or subtypes of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) among children?

Findings

In this cross-sectional study of 45 562 school-aged children in China, SHS exposure from pregnancy to childhood was associated with higher odds of having ADHD symptoms and subtypes. When considering the timing of SHS exposure, the associations were somewhat stronger in the prenatal and early postnatal periods.

Meaning

These findings support the association of SHS exposure with ADHD-related symptoms among children and highlight the importance of strengthening public health efforts to reduce SHS exposure.

### Animal models of childhood exposure to lead or manganese: evidence for impaired attention, impulse control, and affect regulation and assessment of potential therapies [^117LvrhA]. Neurotherapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

Behavioral disorders involving attention and impulse control dysfunction, such as ADHD, are among the most prevalent disorders in children and adolescents, with significant impact on their lives. The etiology of these disorders is not well understood, but is recognized to be multifactorial, with studies reporting associations with polygenic and environmental risk factors, including toxicant exposure. Environmental epidemiological studies, while good at establishing associations with a variety of environmental and genetic risk factors, cannot establish causality. Animal models of behavioral disorders, when properly designed, can play an essential role in establishing causal relationships between environmental risk factors and a disorder, as well as provide model systems for elucidating underlying neural mechanisms and testing therapies. Here, we review how animal model studies of developmental lead or manganese exposure have been pivotal in (1) establishing a causal relationship between developmental exposure and lasting dysfunction in the domains of attention, impulse control, and affect regulation, and (2) testing the efficacy of specific therapeutic approaches for alleviating the lasting deficits. The lead and manganese case studies illustrate how animal models can advance knowledge in ways that are not possible in human studies. For example, in contrast to the Treatment of Lead Poisoned Children (TLC) human clinical trial evaluating succimer chelation efficacy to improve cognitive functioning in lead-exposed children, our developmental lead exposure animal model showed that succimer chelation can produce lasting cognitive benefits if chelation sufficiently reduces brain lead levels. In addition, this study revealed that succimer treatment in the absence of lead exposure produces lasting cognitive dysfunction, highlighting potential risks of chelation in off-label uses, such as the treatment of autistic children without a history of lead exposure. Our animal model of developmental manganese exposure has demonstrated that manganese can cause lasting attentional and sensorimotor deficits, akin to an ADHD-inattentive behavioral phenotype, thereby providing insights into the role of environmental exposures as contributors to ADHD. These studies have also shown that oral methylphenidate (Ritalin) can fully alleviate the deficits produced by early developmental Mn exposure. Future work should continue to focus on the development and use of animal models that appropriately recapitulate the complex behavioral phenotypes of behavioral disorders, in order to determine the mechanistic basis for the behavioral deficits caused by developmental exposure to environmental toxicants, and the efficacy of existing and emerging therapies.

### Individual and combined association between prenatal polysubstance exposure and childhood risk of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^113z9tsb]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

Using innovative statistical methods, this cohort study found that any increase in the number of substances used during gestation was associated with increases in the risk of developing ADHD in later childhood, and exposures to opioids combined with cannabis and opioids combined with tobacco smoking were of particular concern. These findings have public health implications for addressing polysubstance exposure among children during gestation. Future work is needed to identify potential mechanisms through which substances interact and to integrate this understanding into interventions to inform the clinical counseling of women who use substances during pregnancy.

This article addresses the current understanding of the neurobiological bases of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), focusing on empiric research findings that connect genetic and environmental factors to structural and functional brain abnormalities, ultimately leading to a set of age-dependent behavioral manifestations. Section one presents evidence for genetic risk factors for ADHD and discusses the role of potential environmental factors in the etiology of the disorder. Section two focuses on brain imaging studies and how they have helped generate different hypotheses regarding the pathophysiology of ADHD. Finally, the article addresses the longitudinal course of symptoms in ADHD from infancy to adulthood in an attempt to place biological findings for this complex brain disorder in the context of maturation and development.

### Genetics of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [^114BiHPL]. Molecular Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions and future directions

There can be no doubt that DNA variants in genes or regulatory regions increase the risk for ADHD. In rare cases, a single genetic defect may lead to ADHD in the absence of other DNA variants. We do not know how many of these rare variants exist or if such variants require environmental triggers for ADHD to emerge. It is equally clear that no common DNA variants are necessary and sufficient causes of ADHD. Genome-wide association studies show that a genetic susceptibility to ADHD comprised of many common DNA variants accounts for about one-third of the twin study estimates of ADHD's heritability. We do not know yet which variants or how many of them make up the polygenic component. The heritability that cannot be explained by main effects of rare or common variants is likely due to gene−gene interactions, gene−environment interactions or gene−environment correlations.

The convincing evidence for genes as risk factors for ADHD does not exclude the environment as a source of etiology. The fact that twin estimates of heritability are less than 100% asserts quite strongly that environmental factors must be involved. ADHD's heritability is high, and that estimate encompasses gene by environment interaction. Thus, it is possible that such interactions will account for much of ADHD's etiology. Environmental risk factors likely work through epigenetic mechanisms, which have barely been studied in ADHD. The importance of the environment can also be seen in the fact that, as for other complex genetic disorders, much of ADHD's heritability is explained by SNPs in regulatory regions rather than coding regions.

Another hypothesis for future research to explore is the possibility that ADHD is an omnigenic disorder. The omnigenic model of Boyle et al. posits the existence of a small number of "core genes" having "biologically interpretable roles in disease" along with a much greater quantity of "peripheral genes" regulating the core genes. Because there are many more peripheral genes, they account for a greater proportion of the variability in heritability than do the core genes. Because core genes are more likely than peripheral genes to be relevant for developing biomarkers and treatment targets, separating these two classes from one another will require more research.

### Overview of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in young children [^114M3dJx]. Health Psychology Research (2015). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder:

- **Definition**: Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder is a common psychiatric disorder characterized by pervasive and impairing symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity according to DSM-V.
- **Pathophysiology**: Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder is caused by biological (genetics, brain structure and their influence on neuropsychology) and environmental (pregnancy or birth complications, exposure to environmental toxins, chaotic parenting, and diet) factors.
- **Disease course**: The interplay of environmental, genetic factors, and dysfunction in the frontal cortex, basal ganglia, corpus callosum, and cerebellum results in attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, which results in clinical manifestations of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. ADHD is associated with poor motor coordination, impaired academic functioning, unintentional physical injury, sleep disturbances, and poor QoL.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder is not associated with an increased risk of natural-cause mortality.

### Early life programming as a target for prevention of child and adolescent mental disorders [^116pb4fD]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The evidence base for lead exposure and neurodevelopmental outcomes is not matched anywhere else in the environmental chemical literature. Other environmental chemicals with established neurodevelopmental toxicity include methyl mercury and the polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Environmental exposure to each has established associations with general cognitive function, although the relevance to broader mental health is less clear. Interestingly, the longitudinal data that does exist support an association with prenatal but not postnatal exposure, in support of the DOHaD hypothesis. The strongest evidence is for associations with ADHD and executive function deficits. Wider mental health outcomes have not been adequately studied to draw conclusions, although data would exist in the New Bedford cohort that we have not been able to find in publication. Biological mechanisms are also unclear, although PCBs are potent endocrine disruptors and modeling supports thyroid function as a putative mechanism.

No consistent specific pattern of deficits emerges that distinguishes neurodevelopmental toxicity due to lead from that due to mercury or PCBs. Observed outcomes in each span both cognitive and affective domains, suggesting common developmental pathways of neurodevelopmental toxicity with relevance to mental health. Research to date does imply that cognitive performance and behavioral problems are more strongly associated with environmental toxicity than emotional problems, although it is not clear if this is due to greater sensitivity to neurodevelopmental toxicity, or greater sensitivity in the population-based methodology and assessment tools used to detect subtle effects at the population level.

Exposure to lead and PCBs are on the decline, and methyl mercury exposure appears to be stable. Yet there is substantial work still to be done to further reduce exposure to these established neurotoxicants, most notably lead, where the ongoing effects of exposure estimated from the US NHANES data mean that this must remain a key priority in the preventive mental health agenda. At the same time there is a growing body of modern chemicals - not previously evaluated for neurodevelopmental toxicity - that now raise concern as potential neurotoxins in need of further evaluation. These include manganese and cadmium - bivalent heavy metal cations like lead and mercury - and many chemicals with endocrine-disrupting actions in vitro similar to those of PCBs (for example, bisphenol A, phthalates, organochloride pesticides, organophosphate pesticides, brominated flame retardants and perfluorinated compounds). The robust evaluation of these chemicals is a substantial new opportunity in preventative mental health. However, beyond even this, there is an appreciation that the potential for neurodevelopmental toxicity is unknown for the vast majority of chemicals in ubiquitous modern usage, emphasizing that there may be other substantial opportunities for mental health prevention, and that there is a need to prioritize understanding in this area.

### Prenatal exposure to acetaminophen and the risk of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: a nationwide study in Taiwan [^114cVoD4]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Studies have suggested that a significant association exists between prenatal exposure to acetaminophen and the offspring's attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) risk. However, this association has largely been unexplored among the Asian population, generally, and the Taiwanese population, specifically.

Methods

In our study, 950 study pairs (children with ADHD [ICD-9-CM code: 314] and their mothers) and 3,800 control pairs (children without ADHD and their mothers) matched by demographic characteristics were identified between 1998 and 2008 from the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database. Maternal use of acetaminophen was assessed in the first trimester, second trimester, and third trimester of pregnancy and over the period from 3 months before pregnancy to the date of last menstrual cycle.

Results

Logistic regression analysis with adjustments for demographic data, gestational infections, comorbid perinatal conditions, and maternal mental health disorders indicated that exposure to acetaminophen in the second trimester (odds ratio [OR] = 1.19; 95% CI, 1.00–1.40), both the first and second trimesters (OR = 1.28; 95% CI, 1.00–1.64), or in any trimester (OR = 1.20; 95% CI, 1.01–1.42) was associated with an increased risk of ADHD in offspring. Sensitivity analysis excluding gestational infections and maternal mental health disorders confirmed this association (OR = 1.33; 95% CI, 1.04–1.69).

Conclusion

Prenatal exposure to acetaminophen was associated with an increased risk of ADHD in offspring, regardless of gestational infections and maternal mental health disorders. Additional studies are necessary to clarify the underlying mechanisms by which prenatal exposure to acetaminophen leads to neurodevelopmental risks.

### Animal models of childhood exposure to lead or manganese: evidence for impaired attention, impulse control, and affect regulation and assessment of potential therapies [^113FTLt8]. Neurotherapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

Epidemiology of Multifactorial Attention, Impulse Control, and Affect Regulation Disorders Associated with Environmental Risk Factors in Children and Adolescents

There are three different clinically recognized phenotypes of ADHD: (1) predominantly inattentive, (2) predominantly hyperactive/impulsive, and (3) combined inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive. Genome-wide association studies indicate that numerous common genetic variants account for ~ 40% of the heritability of ADHD, and candidate gene studies have identified dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin, and neurite outgrowth systems as being associated with ADHD. In addition, environmental factors, including environmental chemical exposure, are also associated with ADHD risk. These environmental exposure risk factors include pre- or early postnatal exposure to neurotoxicants such as cigarette smoke, alcohol, and air pollution, as well as lead, arsenic, manganese, methylmercury, polychlorinated biphenyls, toluene, chlorpyrifos, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, tetrachloroethylene, and the polybrominated diphenyl ethers, to name a few. Overall, it has been posited that the combination of multiple environmental and biological risk factors, as is often the case, likely surpasses a certain ADHD threshold, leading to the development of impairing ADHD symptoms.

### Association of maternal use of triptans during pregnancy with risk of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in offspring [^113CqS7o]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is prenatal exposure to triptans associated with an increased risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in offspring?

Findings

This population-based cohort study of 10 167 children found no associations between prenatal exposure to triptans and ADHD diagnosis or ADHD symptoms among offspring.

Meaning

These findings suggest that there is no increased risk of ADHD in offspring associated with prenatal exposure to triptans.

### A prospective birth cohort study on early childhood lead levels and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: new insight on sex differences [^112M1qBU]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the prospective associations between early childhood lead exposure and subsequent risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in childhood and its potential effect modifiers.

Study Design

We analyzed data from 1479 mother-infant pairs (299 ADHD, 1180 neurotypical) in the Boston Birth Cohort. The child's first blood lead measurement and physician-diagnosed ADHD was obtained from electronic medical records. Graphic plots and multiple logistic regression were used to examine dose-response associations between lead exposure and ADHD and potential effect modifiers, adjusting for pertinent covariables.

Results

We found that 8.9% of the children in the Boston Birth Cohort had elevated lead levels (5–10µg/dL) in early childhood, which was associated with a 66% increased risk of ADHD (OR,1.66; 95% CI, 1.08–2.56). Among boys, the association was significantly stronger (OR, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.46–4.26); in girls, the association was largely attenuated (P value for sex-lead interaction = .017). The OR of ADHD associated with elevated lead levels among boys was reduced by one-half if mothers had adequate high-density lipoprotein levels compared with low high-density lipoprotein, or if mothers had low stress compared with high stress during pregnancy.

Conclusions

Elevated early childhood blood lead levels increased the risk of ADHD. Boys were more vulnerable than girls at a given lead level. This risk of ADHD in boys was reduced by one-half if the mother had adequate high-density lipoprotein levels or low stress. These findings shed new light on the sex difference in ADHD and point to opportunities for early risk assessment and primary prevention of ADHD.

### Individual and combined association between prenatal polysubstance exposure and childhood risk of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^112nbrdL]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

This study is also the first, to our knowledge, to report the ordinal associations between increased substance use and the risk of ADHD. Using aggregate measures of polysubstance use, we found an additive statistical effect between the number of substances used during pregnancy and ADHD risk. Use of both weighting schemas yielded similar effect sizes, which added plausibility to our results. These effect sizes likely reflected the aggregate burden which, in the context of a harm reduction framework, may provide some insight regarding possible benefits associated with reducing the use of any substance during pregnancy. Focusing on the most obviously harmful exposures may be a useful way to reduce the risk of ADHD. Further work is needed to directly investigate this hypothesis and examine whether reduction in the use of any substance among those with polysubstance use could be acceptable compared with abstinence.

We also identified important interactions between substances that appeared to increase the risk of ADHD. Only 1 previous studydirectly compared the associations of tobacco vs alcohol with the risk of ADHD, and 1 studyexamined the consequences of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke among pregnant women who did not themselves smoke and the combination of exposure to environmental tobacco and alcohol. Studies that have examined illicit polysubstance use have only used aggregate measures and have not identified specific interactions associated with ADHD risk. Our findings suggest opioids may interact with other substances (including cannabis), which may be particularly deleterious. It is not clear whether this interaction is owing to biological or environmental factors, such as whether individuals with illicit polysubstance use are more likely to use more substances or whether they have other characteristics that may impact child development. Future research is needed to further examine potential biological mechanisms.

Strengths and Limitations

This study has several strengths. The study was conducted among a multiethnic cohort with low income who were at increased risk for both the exposure and outcome. This sample allowed us to identify associations with substances, particularly cannabis and opioids, that other studies may not have had sufficient statistical power to assess. We also had a range of neurodevelopmental outcome data available, which allowed us to identify neurotypical children for inclusion in the control group and reduce the likelihood of misclassification of cases. This study is the first, to our knowledge, to examine outcomes associated with exposure to a myriad of interactive substances within the same cohort. Using innovative methods for environmental mixtures, we modeled additive, multiplicative, and nonlinear interactions among 4 substances to identify prenatal exposure combinations that could be associated with ADHD risk among children.

### Prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke or alcohol and cerebellum volume in attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder and typical development [^112ojC9G]. Translational Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Prenatal exposure to teratogenic substances, such as nicotine and alcohol, is associated with long-term negative effects on cognition and behavior. One behavioral sequel is an increased risk of developing attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In fact, exposure to these substances is currently one of the more vigorously investigated environmental risk factors for ADHD. The biological mechanisms underlying the association may be diverse, but it is generally assumed that prenatal exposure disrupts early brain development and that its effects continue over development. However, to date studies investigating the association between prenatal exposure to teratogenic substances and ADHD have been based on behavioral ratings and have not assessed the neurobiological substrates underlying the association.

Prenatal maternal cigarette smoking or use of alcohol potentially carries several risks to the developing brain. Both are known to alter placenta functioning indirectly and may cause hypoxic events. The greatest immediate threat associated with cigarette smoking comes from nicotine, through its interaction with nicotine acetylcholine receptors. Acetylcholine is an important regulator of cell survival, neuronal path finding and targeting, migration, and the generation of neural circuits in the developing brain. Direct effects of alcohol on prenatal brain development include interference with neurotrophic factors and cell adhesion molecules, altered glial maturation, and dysregulation of cell migration. Cell damage and loss may be caused by oxidative stress, excitotoxicity or by apoptosis mediated by glutamergic antagonism.

In the longer term, the cerebellum may be particularly vulnerable to prenatal exposure to both nicotine and alcohol. The cerebellum shows a protracted developmental pattern, potentially rendering it vulnerable to the effects of prenatal exposure over a relatively long period. In utero reductions in the size of cerebellum have been reported for fetuses of mothers who smoked during pregnancy. The developing cerebellum may be also be particularly sensitive to the effects of alcohol exposure, as alcohol has been shown to lead to cell death of Purkinje cells in particular.

Structural neuroimaging studies have reported brain changes related in both ADHD and prenatal alcohol exposure that show striking similarity, suggesting that prenatal exposure to teratogenic substances may, in some cases, have a role in aberrant brain development in ADHD. Reductions in the volume of the whole brain, cerebellum and caudate are replicated findings in children prenatally exposed to alcohol, and in ADHD. Structural neuroimaging studies of children exposed prenatally to nicotine are scarcer, but those available have reported reductions in volume of similar brain regions, including of total brain, and prefrontal cortex.

### Maternal smoking and attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in offspring: a meta-analysis [^11637hcx]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Context

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder in childhood. Exploring the risk factors for ADHD is helpful in preventing ADHD.

Objective

To explore the association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and the occurrence of ADHD in offspring.

Data Sources

PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched from inception to May 2017 for studies.

Study Selection

Cohort or case-control studies in which the association between maternal smoking and ADHD in offspring were investigated were eligible if they included odds ratios (ORs), hazard ratios, or risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Data Extraction

Two investigators independently extracted data on definition of exposure and outcome, number of cases and total sample population, and potential confounders adjusted. Any dose-relationship data for smoking and ADHD risk were also extracted.

Results

Fifteen cohort studies and 5 case-control studies with 50044 cases and 2998059 participants were included. Smoking during pregnancy increased the risk of offspring ADHD (OR: 1.60; 95% CI: 1.45–1.76). The risk of ADHD was greater for children whose mothers were heavy smokers (OR: 1.75; 95% CI: 1.51–2.02) than for those mothers were light smokers (OR: 1.54; 95% CI: 1.40–1.70).

Limitations

The limitations of our study included different assessment tools of ADHD and a lack of objective biological measures for maternal smoking.

Conclusions

With our meta-analysis, we provide evidence for an association between maternal smoking and offspring ADHD but do not solve the causality issues concerning potential confounding by other risk factors. More high-quality studies are needed to establish whether the association with smoking is causal.

### Update on environmental risk factors for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^111bQxXr]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurobehavioral disorder affecting 5% to 10% of children. Although considered to be a highly familial disorder, ADHD heritability estimates of 60% to 80% highlight the considerable role that environmental factors may still play in disorder susceptibility. Proposed ADHD environmental risk factors include prenatal substance exposures, heavy metal and chemical exposures, nutritional factors, and lifestyle/psychosocial factors. This paper reviews the literature published in 2010 investigating the association between environmental risk factors and ADHD or related symptomatology. Sources of risk factor exposure and the proposed mechanism by which each exposure is linked to ADHD-related neurobehavioral changes are also reported. Methodologic limitations of the current literature are discussed, and guidelines for future study are proposed. An improved understanding of the role that environmental factors play in ADHD etiology is critical to future ADHD prevention efforts.

### Etiologic classification of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^117Wr8JC]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is a neurobiological syndrome with an estimated prevalence among children and adolescents of 5%. It is a highly heritable disorder, but acquired factors in etiology are sometimes uncovered that may be amenable to preventive measures or specific therapy. Early reports have described symptoms similar to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder that followed brain trauma or viral encephalitis, and recent MRI studies have demonstrated brain volumetric changes that may be involved in the pathophysiology of the syndrome. The American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic Statistical Manual, introduced in 1968, emphasizes symptomatic criteria in diagnosis. Here, an overview of environmental factors in the etiology of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is presented to encourage more emphasis and research on organic causal factors, preventive intervention, and specific therapies. An organic theory and the genetic and biochemical basis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder are briefly reviewed, and an etiologic classification is suggested. Environmental factors are prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal in origin. Pregnancy- and birth-related risk factors include maternal smoking and alcohol ingestion, prematurity, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, and thyroid deficiency. Childhood illnesses associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder include virus infections, meningitis, encephalitis, head injury, epilepsy, toxins, and drugs. More controversial factors discussed are diet-related sensitivities and iron deficiency. Early prenatal recognition, prevention, and treatment of environmental etiologies of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder may reduce physician reliance on symptomatic modification with medication, a frequent reason for parental concern.

### Epigenome-wide association study of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in adults [^114dvJRy]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by age-inappropriate levels of inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity. ADHD is a disabling condition in childhood and adolescence which often persists into adulthood, interfering with the quality of social, academic, or occupational functioning.

ADHD is a multifactorial disorder with an estimated heritability of 76%. Twenty-two percent of its phenotypic variance is explained by common genetic variants, and the proportion of variance still to be explained might be, to some extent, accounted for by gene by environment interactions. In this context, epigenetic processes have emerged as a plausible mechanism by which environmental exposures can lead to long-lasting alterations, such as variation in brain structure or neuronal circuits, found in psychiatric disorders –. There is growing evidence that epigenetic dysregulation is a feature of ADHD. depression, autism –, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder.

### What causes attention deficit hyperactivity disorder? [^112hC9gF]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

Environmental risk factors

Inherited factors are not the only explanation of ADHD. Although there are a number of environmental risk factors that are associated with ADHD (table 3), identifying which of these are causal is challenging. This is because many observed associations might arise as a result of symptoms/disorder in the child or the parent (reverse causation eg, peer rejection, family adversity, low socioeconomic statusor head injury), or from unmeasured confounders that can include inherited factors (see figure 1). Interestingly, time trends studies have shown no increase in the population rate of ADHD over time, although identification has increased. Cross-national studies have not yet found consistent evidence of lower ADHD rates in certain countries. These findings contrast with data on childhood behavioural problems for which rates have risen in the last 50 yearsand vary geographically. These results suggest that for ADHD there are more likely to be multiple environmental risks, each of small effect, with the overall burden of these risks remaining similar over time and between countries. Some of these risk effects might be modified by genetic influences (gene–environment interaction). Environmental risks can also alter gene function through tissue-specific epigenetic mechanisms. For example, animal studies have demonstrated how adverse early rearing has an impact on stress responses through such mechanisms and that these biological changes can be transmitted to subsequent generations.

Our findings provide further support for negative impacts of prenatal and/or childhood exposure to certain chemicals and raise the possibility that primary prevention and targeted screening could prevent or mitigate ADHD symptomatology. Furthermore, these findings support the need for regular review of regulations as our scientific understanding of the risks posed by these chemicals evolves. Subjects:

### Understanding the causal relationships of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder with mental disorders and suicide attempt: a network mendelian randomisation study [^112veQor]. BMJ Mental Health (2023). High credibility.

Background

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a lifespan neurodevelopmental condition characterised by the presence of inattentive and/or hyperactive/impulsive symptoms in children and adolescents that extends to adulthood in up to 65%. Consequently, individuals with ADHD exhibit deficits in executive function, emotional regulation and motivation. Worldwide, the prevalence of ADHD is estimated to be 5.3% in children/adolescents and 2.5% in adults. Epidemiological studies show that ADHD in childhood is more common in boys than in girls, but in adults there seems to be an equal gender distribution. Prospective studies including children with the disease observed a decline of symptoms with increasing age. Therapeutic approaches consist mainly of pharmacological and psychological treatments, but to date there is no single or universal treatment for this disorder.

The aetiology of ADHD is not fully understood. The disorder is thought to result from complex interactions between genetic and environmental risk factors. Furthermore, prenatal and perinatal factors have been discussed as contributing causes. However, genetic factors seem to play the most important role, as the heritability rate is 70–80%.

There are a number of observational studies showing that ADHD is associated with non-mental diseases across the lifespan (eg, neurological disorders, endocrine and metabolic diseases, and autoimmune diseases). In addition, there is evidence that ADHD is related to other mental disorders; in particular, ADHD appears to be associated with mood and anxiety disorders. In a very recent meta-analysis by Nourredine et al, ADHD in childhood was found to be associated with a higher risk of later psychotic disorders. However, whether there is a causal link between ADHD and other mental disorders remains unknown because, in observational studies, confounding and reverse causation cannot be excluded.

### The co-occurrence of autistic and ADHD dimensions in adults: an etiological study in 17, 770 twins [^115rbpZL]. Translational Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Apart from a genetic contribution, unique environmental variation accounted for approximately half of the phenotypic correlations. A couple of studies provided evidence for an association between increasing paternal age and psychiatric outcomes such as ASD and ADHD in offspring, probably due to new genetic mutations during spermatogenesis. Non-genetically mediated low birth weight and related delayed brain maturationhave also been associated with both ASD, and ADHD, even after strict correction for potential confounders, but the underlying risk mechanism is still unclear. The negative impact of toxins such as air pollutants, tobacco, heavy metals and pesticides on ASDand ADHDhas been studied rather extensively in animals, and to a much lesser extent in humans. Yet, results so far are mixed, and these findings should therefore be treated with great caution. A recent epigenetic study showed that MZ twins discordant for ASD and related traits differed on DNA methylation profiles. Interestingly, apart from CpG alterations affecting ASD in general, a substantial number of associated CpG sites were specific for dimensions of ASD, again suggesting heterogeneity in the risk factors affecting the different disorder dimensions.

Genetic factors could be equalized for males and females, indicating neither quantitative nor qualitative sex differences on ASD and ADHD dimensions. These results mirror previous studies that examined total scores of ASDand ADHD traits. Moreover, we did not find evidence for sex differences in the genetic or environmental factors affecting the co-occurrence of ASD and ADHD traits. The lack of sex-specific genetic influences on ASD and ADHD and their co-occurrence, together with the observation that the prevalence for both conditions is markedly higher in males, suggests that the effect of genetic risk factors may be different in males and females. This is line with the 'female protective model' proposing that females are relatively protected from genetic mutations that cause neurodevelopmental conditions in males.

### Association of maternal neurodevelopmental risk alleles with early-life exposures [^111k4X1n]. JAMA Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Our results have implications for supporting pregnant women with neurodevelopmental problems such as ADHD, given that maternal neurodevelopmental risk alleles were associated with exposure to adverse conditions (eg, stress) and risky behaviors (eg, smoking) in pregnancy. The associations between ADHD PRS and prenatal exposures were generally of small magnitude, and additional types of investigations are needed to assess whether the associations are of clinical importance. Nevertheless, our findings add to the increasing evidence that the observational associations between many prenatal factors and neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring may be at least partially genetically confounded. However, the presence of genetic confounding does not exclude a causal effect. Genetic effects may even be mediated through an environmental exposure. For example, in the present study, we found that maternal ADHD PRS was associated with higher levels of the heavy metal cadmium, for which smoking is a common source. Although maternal genetic liability for ADHD predisposes mothers to smoke during pregnancy, prenatal cadmium exposure due to smoking could still be associated with an increased risk for ADHD in offspring. However, this increased risk has been shown to be unlikely by triangulation of evidence from studies comparing smoking during pregnancy between mothers and fathers and between genetically related and unrelated mothers (in vitro fertilization cohort). Disentangling complex questions of whether prenatal factors causally influence risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring will likely require such triangulation of evidence from multiple approaches that rely on different assumptions and have unrelated sources of potential biases, including genetically informed methods.

### The association between attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and general anaesthesia-a narrative review [^11246nrN]. Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a chronic neurodevelopmental disorder, manifesting primarily as attention deficit, hyperactivity and impulsive behaviour. General anaesthetics can be neurotoxic, affecting neuronal differentiation and synaptogenesis, which can lead to abnormalities of cognition, learning and behaviour. We hypothesise that exposure of the immature brain to general anaesthetics predisposes to the development of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. In this review, we summarise clinical and animal studies that relate attention deficit hyperactivity disorder to general anaesthesia, by actions on neural molecular mechanisms and neural networks. We also describe potential therapeutic approaches to modulate these effects.

### Shared biological risks that influence brain and behaviour [^114jePDx]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder. Comorbidity with other neurodevelopmental conditions, learning problems and psychiatric disorders is high and ADHD symptoms themselves, particularly inattention, can also persist into adulthood. ADHD is indexed by high levels of functional impairment and adversely affects social relationships, academic achievements and employment record. Rates of substance misuse and smoking behaviours are elevated, contributing to the physical and mental health disadvantage of those with ADHD.

Although highly heritable, ADHD is aetiologically complex whereby the coaction and interaction of inherited and non-inherited factors likely play a role in its development, maintenance and adverse consequences. Indeed, no single causal risk factor, genetic or otherwise, has been identified to date as is the case for all common, complex disorders. The evidence suggests there is contribution from both common genetic variants of small effect size and rare variants (copy number variants) of larger effect size. Such variants have been found to impact on similar biological pathways, interestingly including one related to nicotinic acetylcholine receptor signalling. There is also growing evidence that ADHD inherited risks and associated gene variants have different phenotypic effects (pleiotropy). That is, the same set of genetic risks appears to influence ADHD, autism and other forms of developmental disorder/psychopathology and behaviour. A research question related to this observation is tackled by Thakur and colleagues.

### Association of maternal neurodevelopmental risk alleles with early-life exposures [^111ZMqfH]. JAMA Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Early-life exposures, such as prenatal maternal lifestyle, illnesses, nutritional deficiencies, toxin levels, and adverse birth events, have long been considered potential risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring. However, maternal genetic factors could be confounding the association between early-life exposures and neurodevelopmental outcomes in offspring, which makes inferring a causal relationship problematic.

Objective

To test whether maternal polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for neurodevelopmental disorders were associated with early-life exposures previously linked to the disorders.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this UK population-based cohort study, 7921 mothers with genotype data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) underwent testing for association of maternal PRS for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD PRS), autism spectrum disorder (ASD PRS), and schizophrenia (SCZ PRS) with 32 early-life exposures. ALSPAC data collection began September 6, 1990, and is ongoing. Data were analyzed for the current study from April 1 to September 1, 2018.

Exposures

Maternal ADHD PRS, ASD PRS, and SCZ PRS were calculated using discovery effect size estimates from the largest available genome-wide association study and a significance threshold of P < .05.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Outcomes measured included questionnaire data on maternal lifestyle and behavior (eg, smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index, and maternal age), maternal use of nutritional supplements and medications in pregnancy (eg, acetaminophen, iron, zinc, folic acid, and vitamins), maternal illnesses (eg, diabetes, hypertension, rheumatism, psoriasis, and depression), and perinatal factors (eg, birth weight, preterm birth, and cesarean delivery).

Results

Maternal PRSs were available from 7921 mothers (mean [SD] age, 28.5[4.8] years). The ADHD PRS was associated with multiple prenatal factors, including infections (odds ratio [OR], 1.11; 95% CI, 1.04–1.18), use of acetaminophen during late pregnancy (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.04–1.18), lower blood levels of mercury (β coefficient, -0.06; 95% CI, -0.11 to -0.02), and higher blood levels of cadmium (β coefficient, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.05–0.09). Little evidence of associations between ASD PRS or SCZ PRS and prenatal factors or of association between any of the PRSs and adverse birth events was found. Sensitivity analyses revealed consistent results.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that maternal risk alleles for neurodevelopmental disorders, primarily ADHD, are associated with some pregnancy-related exposures. These findings highlight the need to carefully account for potential genetic confounding and triangulate evidence from different approaches when assessing the effects of prenatal exposures on neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring.

### Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and substance use disorders [^113KJ19Y]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2001). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common childhood disorder that often continues to manifest symptoms into adulthood. In children and adults, this condition may contribute to addictive vulnerability. Several factors are common to the developmental psychopathology of these conditions, suggesting an underlying deficit in behavioral regulation as an explanation for this comorbidity. Developmentally, faulty learning processes or attempts to self-medicate dysfunctional behavior may contribute to the pathogenesis of substance use disorders. Substance abuse itself also may contribute to the development of attentional deficits and behavioral dysregulation through direct (eg, prenatal or self-inflicted exposures to neurotoxic substances) and indirect (eg, poverty, neglect, abuse) mechanisms. Because ADHD can be identified prior to the peak onset of substance use, effective treatment of this common disorder may reduce the development of substance use disorders. Adult ADHD may also contribute to the development and maintenance of substance use disorders Substance abuse patients may particularly benefit from treatment of this comorbidity.

### Attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^11524h9e]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2015). Medium credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a persistent neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 5% of children and adolescents and 2.5% of adults worldwide. Throughout an individual's lifetime, ADHD can increase the risk of other psychiatric disorders, educational and occupational failure, accidents, criminality, social disability and addictions. No single risk factor is necessary or sufficient to cause ADHD. In most cases ADHD arises from several genetic and environmental risk factors that each have a small individual effect and act together to increase susceptibility. The multifactorial causation of ADHD is consistent with the heterogeneity of the disorder, which is shown by its extensive psychiatric co-morbidity, its multiple domains of neurocognitive impairment and the wide range of structural and functional brain anomalies associated with it. The diagnosis of ADHD is reliable and valid when evaluated with standard criteria for psychiatric disorders. Rating scales and clinical interviews facilitate diagnosis and aid screening. The expression of symptoms varies as a function of patient developmental stage and social and academic contexts. Although there are no curative treatments for ADHD, evidenced-based treatments can markedly reduce its symptoms and associated impairments. For example, medications are efficacious and normally well tolerated, and various non-pharmacological approaches are also valuable. Ongoing clinical and neurobiological research holds the promise of advancing diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to ADHD.

### Antidepressant use during pregnancy and risk of autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: systematic review of observational studies and methodological considerations [^116m3zWZ]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The safety of medicines during pregnancy and their effect on foetal development is an important concern for public health and medicines regulatory agencies worldwide. Clinical drug safety trials in pregnant women are usually infeasible or unethical to perform. Therefore, evidence from observational studies is relied upon to evaluate the safety of medicines used during pregnancy to inform regulatory decision-making and assess the need for risk-minimisation measures.

Childhood neurodevelopmental disorders are a group of conditions with onset in the developmental period, often before children reach school age. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 (DSM-5), neurodevelopmental disorders are organised into seven subcategories: intellectual disabilities, communication disorders, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), specific learning disorders, motor disorders and other neurodevelopmental disorders (those disorders having symptoms consistent with, but which fail to meet full diagnostic criteria for, any disorder in the neurodevelopmental disorder diagnostic class). Potential risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders include male sex, genetic influences, health behaviours associated with socioeconomic characteristics (such as abuse of alcohol or use of recreational drugs), parental mental health disorders, toxin exposure, obesity, and prenatal and delivery complications. However, these disorders often encompass a spectrum of presentations, and there are likely to be potentially unknown environmental or genetic risk factors. Partly because of this spectrum, the definition will depend on the age at assessment and it is very difficult to standardise within and between studies. It is certainly not a simple 'yes/no' binary outcome.

### Environmental evaluation of a child with developmental disability [^113xhy87]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Children's health can be affected adversely by the environment in which they live. It is well recognized that some environmental chemicals are harmful to the brain, but the role these chemicals play in the development of specific disabilities such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism is not certain. Parents of children who have developmental disabilities often ask the primary care physician whether certain environmental toxicants might be the cause of the illness. A detailed environmental history and physical examination may help clarify whether there is a plausible relationship between an environmental toxicant and a child's disability.

### Management of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder during pregnancy [^115z4Dnw]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurobehavioral disorder affecting 3.2% of women. More women are taking psychostimulant medications, including during pregnancy. Although stimulant use does not appear to be associated with congenital malformations, there are inconsistent data about other obstetric risks, and no long-term neurodevelopmental data exist to inform clinical management decisions. This article summarizes the available data regarding perinatal exposure to psychostimulants. It also highlights the importance of the risk-risk analysis for clinicians and patients to consider, weighing risks of medication exposure to risks of ADHD during pregnancy, including driving safety and major impairment in occupational roles.

### Dynamical properties of elemental metabolism distinguish attention deficit hyperactivity disorder from autism spectrum disorder [^115SEZEp]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Our study is limited by a small sample size, although it was sufficient to distinguish significant differences in cyclical metal properties between ADHD, ASD, ADHD/ASD combined, and neurotypical development. As a consequence of this, it was not possible to implement robust cross-validation procedures, and these results should therefore not be interpreted as a generalizable algorithm for predictive phenotyping or diagnostic assessment. Nonetheless, the utility of both supervised and unsupervised methods in separating neurodevelopmental phenotypes, and the general overlap in features that discriminate ASD & ADHD, suggest that elemental dynamics, particularly relating to zinc periodicity, may provide a powerful signature for future studies to leverage for predictive phenotyping. The differentiation of behavioral phenotypes including ADHD, ASD and their combined presentation from elemental metabolic features further emphasizes the significance of these processes in neurodevelopment, and the potential future applications of these methods in a broader sample. The use of twins in our study allowed us to control for underlying genetic factors and to increase our power to detect differences between diagnostic groups. However, further work is needed in non-twin participants to confirm and extend our results. Organic environmental chemicals may also play a role in ADHD, a topic not addressed in our study.

Studies of environmental exposures and ADHD have primarily focused on the magnitude of exposures as determined by concentrations in blood, urine or other biological matrices. By analyzing dynamical processes in elemental exposure profiles, we have uncovered differences in elemental metabolism that would not be apparent in measures of exposure intensity alone. Furthermore, our findings have implications for early detection of ADHD, ASD, and ADHD/ASD combined cases because the signatures we have observed are present prenatally and in early postnatal development. Pathways we have identified, once validated, may also offer targets for prevention of toxic exposures and early intervention in the form of modification of elemental metabolism towards a healthy molecular phenotype.

### Prenatal cotinine levels and ADHD among offspring [^112KcnpK]. Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

An association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and offspring attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been shown across several studies based on self-reports. No previous studies have investigated the association of nicotine exposure measured by cotinine levels during pregnancy and offspring ADHD.

Methods

In this population-based study, 1079 patients born between 1998 and 1999 and diagnosed with ADHD according to the International Classification of Diseases and 1079 matched controls were identified from Finnish nationwide registers. Maternal cotinine levels were measured by using quantitative immunoassays from maternal serum specimens collected during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy and archived in the national biobank.

Results

There was a significant association between increasing log-transformed maternal cotinine levels and offspring ADHD. The odds ratio was 1.09 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06–1.12) when adjusting for maternal socioeconomic status, maternal age, maternal psychopathology, paternal age, paternal psychopathology, and child's birth weight for gestational age. In the categorical analyses with cotinine levels in 3 groups, heavy nicotine exposure (cotinine level > 50 ng/mL) was associated with offspring ADHD, with an odds ratio of 2.21 (95% CI 1.63–2.99) in the adjusted analyses. Analyses by deciles of cotinine levels revealed that the adjusted odds for offspring ADHD in the highest decile was 3.34 (95% CI 2.02–5.52).

Conclusions

The study reveals an association with and a dose-response relationship between nicotine exposure during pregnancy and offspring ADHD. Future studies incorporating maternal smoking and environmental, genetic, and epigenetic factors are warranted.

### Long-term prenatal exposure to paracetamol is associated with DNA methylation differences in children diagnosed with ADHD [^115nJDqY]. Clinical Epigenetics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common childhood disorder defined by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, which impair normal functioning and development. It is one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders of childhood affecting approximately 5% of children worldwide, often continuing into adulthood. ADHD is considered to have a strong genetic basis, with heritability estimates up to 70%. Although candidate gene studies have identified genes associated with ADHD, numerous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and meta-analyses have not found any significant ADHD risk variants.

Several epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to a range of putative environmental risk factors are associated with ADHD, particularly during the prenatal and perinatal period. However, these factors can only be regarded as correlates because, at present, convincing evidence that the associations reflect causal relationships have not been established. ADHD is a complex disorder influenced by the interplay of various genetic and environmental factors. The mechanisms by which the environment mediates ADHD susceptibility is not well understood, but epigenetic changes may be involved.

Recently, five epidemiological studies have revealed a consistent association between long-term exposure to paracetamol (acetaminophen) during pregnancy and ADHD symptoms and adverse neurodevelopment in children. Paracetamol, which is available without prescription, is the most commonly used drug during pregnancy taken by ~50% of pregnant woman to treat fever, headache, and other pain conditions. If the association between prenatal paracetamol exposure and neurodevelopmental disorders is causal, the underlying mechanisms remain to be clarified.

In this study, we aimed to assess whether epigenetic differences are associated with prenatal exposure to paracetamol and development of ADHD. To do this, we have conducted an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) in samples selected from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort (MoBa) and investigated whether long-term prenatal exposure to paracetamol was associated with DNA methylation changes in cord blood and clinical ADHD diagnoses recorded in the Norwegian Patient Registry (NPR) from 2008 to 2014.

### Urinary trichlorophenol levels and increased risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder among US school-aged children [^115DpRFj]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our intention was to evaluate the neurological health effects of low levels of 2,4,5-TCP and 2,4,6-TCP among school-aged children. We found that exposure to 2,4,6-TCP was associated with parental report of a diagnosis of ADHD. We also demonstrated a significant dose–response relationship between exposure to 2,4,6-TCP and ADHD. In contrast, we did not find a significant association between exposure to 2,4,5-TCP and ADHD. These findings suggest that 2,4,6-TCP may have different health effects than 2,4,5-TCP, which is consistent with patterns of association previously reported in the literature. Experimental evidence suggests that 2,4,6-TCP but not 2,4,5-TCP is associated with increased risks of multiple cancers.

Both 2,4,6-TCP and 2,4,5-TCP are members of a family of organochlorine pesticides which are a large class of multipurpose chlorinated hydrocarbon chemicals that break down slowly in the environment and accumulate in fatty tissue. The presence of urinary TCPs indicates direct exposure to these chemicals or other organochlorine pesticides including hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCH) which metabolise to TCPs in humans. Although many organochlorine pesticides are no longer widely used in the USA, children can be exposed to these chemicals through diet and contaminated air because of the intensive use of these chemicals in the past, and their lipophilic and chemically stable characters. Exposure to these chemicals may occur early in life. Although information on the potential health effects of HCB and HCH on child neurodevelopment is limited, evidence of neurotoxicity in humans exposed to organochlorine compounds including HCB and HCH has previously been presented. Several studies suggest that prenatal exposure to organochlorine compounds is associated with an increase in ADHD symptoms among children at 4 years of age. Therefore, the observed association between urinary 2,4,6-TCP and ADHD in our study does not exclude the possibility that the ADHD is caused by HCB and/or HCH exposures.

### A methylome-wide association study of trajectories of oppositional defiant behaviors and biological overlap with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [^112bAj9F]. Child Development (2018). Low credibility.

With regard to environmental effects, DNA methylation has been shown to vary as a function of numerous nutritional, chemical, physical, and psychosocial exposures (Szyf & Bick, 2013). The methylation of CpG sites, overrepresented in CpG islands and often located in the promoter regulatory regions of many genes, disrupts the binding of transcription factors and can have important effects on normal gene function, hence providing a potential mechanism for long‐term alterations (and maintenance) in phenotype (Meaney, 2010). DNA methylation is proposed as a mechanism by which exposure to early adverse conditions during critical periods of development can result in long‐term vulnerability for disease (Gluckman, Hanson, Spencer, & Bateson, 2005). To date, much of what is known about DNA methylation is based on animal research where variability in DNA methylation in response to prenatal risk exposures and teratogens has been examined in highly controlled experimental research (Roth, 2013). Animal findings are beginning to be validated in observational studies in humans using peripheral samples (i.e. blood, buccal cells). For example, prenatal maternal depression, anxiety, nutrition, and toxin exposure (e.g. cigarettes smoking) associates with changes in DNA methylation in the cord blood of newborns (e.g. Binder & Michels, 2013; Richmond et al. 2015).

### Dynamical properties of elemental metabolism distinguish attention deficit hyperactivity disorder from autism spectrum disorder [^112QtPVe]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental condition affecting an estimated 5.3% of children and 2.5% of adults worldwide. Heritability estimates average 75% with a polygenic liability comprising both common and rare variants, suggesting that environmental exposures are also at play –. However, the role of specific environmental exposures and their metabolism in the etiology of ADHD and co-occurring neurodevelopmental conditions, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), remains unclear. Few studies have investigated the association between elemental exposures and ADHD (for reviews, seeand). In addition, those studies have exclusively relied on cross-sectional measures of exposure, primarily blood metal concentrations. They found differences between ADHD and non-ADHD controls for lead, mercury, manganese, iron, zinc, and copper –. Unfortunately, this research does not include information on the timing of exposures relative to their effects on neurodevelopment, or permit contrasts between different neurodevelopmental disorders. For example, lead is the most widely investigated toxic exposure linked to ADHD, but study findings derived from a single time-point measurement do not resolve temporal variations in exposure during critical developmental windows. Using novel tooth matrix biomarkers, we recently demonstrated that essential and toxic elements are differentially regulated in ASD. This was achieved by focusing analyses on time variant cycles in elemental metabolism, which would be missed in analyses relying solely on single time-point concentrations. The combination of multiple cohorts in that study, each drawn from different sites with varying enrollment protocols, nonetheless did not allow a fine scale differentiation of ASD and ADHD phenotypes, as were characterized in the RATSS cohort.

Here, we test the hypothesis that cycles of essential and toxic elements are dysregulated during prenatal and early postnatal development in ADHD and that these profiles distinguish individuals with ADHD from individuals with ASD as well as ADHD/ASD combined presentation. We utilize recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) –, a non-linear method of characterizing signal dynamics, particularly the frequency, duration and complexity of cyclical processes in longitudinal time-series measures of elemental metabolism. In a well-characterized population-derived sample of twins in Sweden, which includes monozygotic twins discordant for ADHD, we apply RQA to fine scale temporal profiles of metal uptake during the prenatal and early postnatal period made possible by recently developed tooth matrix biomarkers. The twin design allows us to account for underlying genetic factors, especially in monozygotic twins.

### Prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke or alcohol and cerebellum volume in attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder and typical development [^114RjXJc]. Translational Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Prenatal exposure to teratogenic substances, such as nicotine or alcohol, increases the risk of developing attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). To date, studies examining this relationship have used symptom scales as outcome measures to assess the effect of prenatal exposure, and have not investigated the neurobiological pathways involved. This study explores the effect of prenatal exposure to cigarettes or alcohol on brain volume in children with ADHD and typically developing controls. Children with ADHD who had been exposed prenatally to either substance were individually matched to children with and without ADHD who had not been. Controls who had been exposed prenatally were also individually matched to controls who had not been. For prenatal exposure to both smoking and alcohol, we found a pattern where subjects with ADHD who had been exposed had the smallest brain volumes and unexposed controls had the largest, with intermediate volumes for unexposed subjects with ADHD. This effect was most pronounced for cerebellum. A similar reduction fell short of significance for controls who had been exposed to cigarettes, but not alcohol. Our results are consistent with an additive effect of prenatal exposure and ADHD on brain volume, with the effects most pronounced for cerebellum.

### Genetic variations influence brain changes in patients with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [^11234UKD]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a clinically heterogeneous neurobiological disorder of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity, affecting 5–7% of children worldwide –. Severity status and symptoms of ADHD vary throughout a person's lifespan; however, adult individuals with ADHD show less noticeable signs of hyperactivity and impulsivity than pediatric patients with ADHD. ADHD may occur either as an isolated condition or as comorbidity with other neurological, psychiatric, and neurodevelopmental disorders. The adverse impact of ADHD on society is profound and multifaceted as it affects not only all aspects of a child's life but also those of siblings and parents, causing significant disturbances to routine family functioning. Furthermore, there are financial burdens related to treatment costs and reduced employment prospects. Based on the severity of the ADHD disorder, it may affect the child's performance at school, and if not treated or left undiagnosed, it may persist into adulthood, affecting both personal and professional life.

Multiple factors contribute to ADHD symptoms, including genetic predisposition, neurodevelopmental issues, abnormal neuronal maturation, brain injury, environmental exposures, and consanguineous marriages. A recent study by Posner et al. reported that environmental risk factors during prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal stages contribute to the symptom of ADHD. The prenatal and perinatal risk factors, including premature birth, low birth weight, history of maternal exposure to tobacco, stress, trauma, and obesity, are substantially associated with ADHD. Postnatal risk factors such as trauma, parenting style, artificial coloring, and flavoring food agents, exposure to pollutants and pesticides can exacerbate the symptoms of ADHD(Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Factors affecting ADHD pathophysiology.

Different factors such as genetic, in particular, gene polymorphisms, environmental factors, psychological factors, individual factors such as age, abnormality in various neurological pathways such as dopaminergic and serotonergic, and comorbidity with multiple disorders are associated with symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.

### Children's low-level pesticide exposure and associations with autism and ADHD: a review [^112A6Kfq]. Pediatric Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Pesticides are chemicals that are designed specifically for the purpose of killing or suppressing another living organism. Human toxicity is possible with any pesticide, and a growing body of literature has investigated possible associations with neurodevelopmental disorders. Attention deficit disorder with or without hyperactivity (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are two of these specific disorders that have garnered particular interest. Exposure to toxic chemicals during critical windows of brain development is a biologically plausible mechanism. This review describes the basic laboratory science including controlled pesticide dosing experiments in animals that supports a mechanistic relationship in the development of ADHD and/or ASD. Epidemiological relationships are also described for low-level pesticide exposure and ADHD and/or ASD. The available evidence supports the hypothesis that pesticide exposure at levels that do not cause acute toxicity may be among the multifactorial causes of ADHD and ASD, though further study is needed, especially for some of the newer pesticides.

### Genetic variations influence brain changes in patients with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [^116a1zau]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurological and neurodevelopmental childhood-onset disorder characterized by a persistent pattern of inattentiveness, impulsiveness, restlessness, and hyperactivity. These symptoms may continue in 55–66% of cases from childhood into adulthood. Even though the precise etiology of ADHD is not fully understood, it is considered as a multifactorial and heterogeneous disorder with several contributing factors such as heritability, auxiliary to neurodevelopmental issues, severe brain injuries, neuroinflammation, consanguineous marriages, premature birth, and exposure to environmental toxins. Neuroimaging and neurodevelopmental assessments may help to explore the possible role of genetic variations on ADHD neuropsychobiology. Multiple genetic studies have observed a strong genetic association with various aspects of neuropsychobiological functions, including neural abnormalities and delayed neurodevelopment in ADHD. The advancement in neuroimaging and molecular genomics offers the opportunity to analyze the impact of genetic variations alongside its dysregulated pathways on structural and functional derived brain imaging phenotypes in various neurological and psychiatric disorders, including ADHD. Recently, neuroimaging genomic studies observed a significant association of brain imaging phenotypes with genetic susceptibility in ADHD. Integrating the neuroimaging-derived phenotypes with genomics deciphers various neurobiological pathways that can be leveraged for the development of novel clinical biomarkers, new treatment modalities as well as therapeutic interventions for ADHD patients. In this review, we discuss the neurobiology of ADHD with particular emphasis on structural and functional changes in the ADHD brain and their interactions with complex genomic variations utilizing imaging genetics methodologies. We also highlight the genetic variants supposedly allied with the development of ADHD and how these, in turn, may affect the brain circuit function and related behaviors. In addition to reviewing imaging genetic studies, we also examine the need for complementary approaches at various levels of biological complexity and emphasize the importance of combining and integrating results to explore biological pathways involved in ADHD disorder. These approaches include animal models, computational biology, bioinformatics analyses, and multimodal imaging genetics studies.

### What causes attention deficit hyperactivity disorder? [^116icnvP]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

Causes of ADHD

ADHD, like other common medical and psychiatric disorders (eg, asthma, schizophrenia), is influenced by multiple genes, non-inherited factors and their interplay. There is no single cause of ADHD and exposure to a risk factor does not necessarily result in disorder. This means that any given risk factor will only be observed in a proportion of cases and will also be found in those who are unaffected. Also, risk factors that contribute to the origins of ADHD might not necessarily be the same as those that influence its course and outcomes.

A further complexity is that genetic factors can exert indirect risk effects through interplay with environmental factors. Genes can alter sensitivity to environmental risks (gene–environment interaction), for example, environmental toxins or psychosocial adversity. Inherited factors can also influence the probability of exposure to certain environmental risks (gene–environment correlation; see later). This means that environmental and genetic risk effects cannot be considered as entirely distinct.

### Meta-analysis of the association between prenatal antibiotic exposure and risk of childhood attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^114o33qg]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2026). Medium credibility.

Background

Studies examining the association between maternal antibiotic use during pregnancy and the risk of childhood attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have yielded inconsistent results. This meta-analysis synthesizes available evidence to establish a more comprehensive understanding of this association.

Methods

Observational studies published through October 2, 2024, were systematically searched from Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, and PubMed databases. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the quality of the included studies, and statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 15.0.

Results

Nine studies encompassing 6,180,434 participants were included. Prenatal antibiotic exposure was associated with an increased risk of childhood ADHD (HR = 1.15; 95% CI = 1.09–1.22, P < 0.0001; OR = 1.28; 95% CI = 1.21–1.35, P < 0.001). Both mid-pregnancy (HR = 1.11; 95% CI = 1.02–1.22, P = 0.282) and late-pregnancy (HR = 1.07; 95% CI = 1.02–1.12, P = 0.521) antibiotic exposure was associated with an increased risk of ADHD. Repeated antibiotic exposures was associated with an increased risk further (twice: HR = 1.13; 95% CI = 1.10–1.16, P = 0.856; ≥ 3 times: HR = 1.21; 95% CI = 1.17–1.24, P = 0.166).

Conclusion

This analysis identified a link between maternal antibiotic use during pregnancy and an increased risk of childhood ADHD. Large-scale, multicenter, well-designed prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings and adjust for potential confounders in evaluating the relationship between prenatal antibiotic exposure and childhood ADHD.

### Association of exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals during adolescence with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder-related behaviors [^1151tcJQ]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals during adolescence a risk factor for behaviors associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)?

Findings

In this cross-sectional analysis of data from 205 adolescents participating in a prospective birth cohort study, exposure to select phthalates was associated with an increased risk of ADHD-related behaviors. Associations were strongest for phthalates with antiandrogenic activity.

Meaning

These findings support the potential importance of exposures to endocrine-disrupting chemicals, especially phthalates, during adolescence as correlates of ADHD-related behaviors.

### Urinary trichlorophenol levels and increased risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder among US school-aged children [^1133QRb5]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The observed association also suggests that direct exposure to 2,4,6-TCP directly affects child neurodevelopment. However, there is limited information on the neurological health effects of 2,4,6-TCP in humans. Because 2,4,6-TCP is one of the major chlorinated organic compounds which are formed during water disinfection, children can be exposed to the chemical through drinking water. Confirmation of a direct health effect of 2,4,6-TCP on child behavioural development would underscore the importance of further examining the potential neurological health effects of prenatal and postnatal exposure to 2,4,6-TCP through chlorinated drinking water.

Our study has several strengths. First, a large population-based sample was used to examine the neurological effects of TCPs and valuable information on the effect of background exposure to TCPs on child neurodevelopment in the general population was collected. Second, we used biomarkers in urine to measure exposures to organochlorine compounds. This method provided an overall measurement of chemical exposures from all sources and a more accurate measurement of body burden of exposure. Third, a wide of range of potential confounders including demographic factors and other environmental toxins such as lead and ETS, was included in the models. Moreover, the exposures to environmental toxins were measured using biomarkers in serum, which could minimise misclassification errors. Fourth, to test the reliability of our estimation we constructed several models with different covariates and found consistent results. Our analyses provided reasonably consistent findings, which are strengthened by an observed dose–response relationship.

### Developmental aspects of environmental neurotoxicology: lessons from lead and polychlorinated biphenyls [^112tJs6T]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2011). Low credibility.

The particular vulnerability of the developing nervous system for low-level exposure to chemicals is well established. It has been argued that some degree of developmental neurotoxicity was found for a large number of industrial chemicals. However, for only few of these, namely inorganic lead, arsenic, organic mercury and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), human evidence is available to suggest that these may cause neurodevelopmental adversity and may, thus, be involved in contributing to neurodevelopmental disorders like autism, attention-deficit disorder, mental retardation or cerebral palsy. The focus of this overview is on PCBs and inorganic lead as developmental neurotoxicants at environmental levels of exposure. The adverse effects of inorganic lead on the developing brain have long been studied, and much emphasis has been on subtle degrees of mental retardation in terms of intelligence (IQ). The evidence is consistent, but the effect sizes are typically small. Research interest has also been devoted to studying aspects of "attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder" (ADHD) in children in relation to environmental exposure to lead in both cross-sectional and case-control studies. More recently, we have also studied core elements of ADHD according to ICD-10 and DSM-IV in relation to environmental exposure to lead, mercury and aluminum in asymptomatic school children in Romania. Both, performance measures (several attention tasks) and questionnaire-based behavior ratings from parents and teachers showed that lead, but not Hg or Al, was consistently and adversely associated with core elements of ADHD. These findings in asymptomatic children nicely fit into the overall pattern of observations and suggest that, apart from genetic influences, low-level exposure to lead contributes to this neurodevelopmental disorder. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are persistent organic pollutants with lipophilic properties. Due to their persistence, they are still present in environmental media at potentially harmful concentrations, although production and use of PCBs was already banned in the early 1980s. Several prospective cohort studies-including our Düsseldorf study-have demonstrated that pre- and early postnatal exposure to PCBs is associated with deficit or retardation of mental and/or motor development, even after adjusting for maternal intelligence and developmental effects of the quality of the home environment. The pathophysiology is still unclear, although interference with thyroid metabolism during brain development is being discussed. Based on these reviews, three aspects, namely pre- vs. postnatal impact, effect scaling for comparative purposes, and integration of neurobehavioral findings into clinical and neuroscience contexts, are outlined as lessons learned from neurodevelopmental observations in children environmentally exposed to lead or PCBs.

### What causes attention deficit hyperactivity disorder? [^11282pit]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) affects around 1–3% of children. There is a high level of comorbidity with developmental and learning problems as well as with a variety of psychiatric disorders. ADHD is highly heritable, although there is no single causal risk factor and non-inherited factors also contribute to its aetiology. The genetic and environmental risk factors that have been implicated appear to be associated with a range of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric outcomes, not just ADHD. The evidence to date suggests that both rare and multiple common genetic variants likely contribute to ADHD and modify its phenotype. ADHD or a similar phenotype also appears to be more common in extreme low birth weight and premature children and those exposed to exceptional early adversity. In this review, the authors consider recent developments in the understanding of risk factors that influence ADHD.

### Prenatal smoking, alcohol and caffeine exposure and maternal-reported attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms in childhood: triangulation of evidence using negative control and polygenic risk score analyses [^113JGA77]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Studies have indicated that maternal prenatal substance use may be associated with offspring attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) via intrauterine effects. We measured associations between prenatal smoking, alcohol and caffeine consumption with childhood ADHD symptoms accounting for shared familial factors.

Design

First, we used a negative control design comparing maternal and paternal substance use. Three models were used for negative control analyses: unadjusted (without confounders), adjusted (including confounders) and mutually adjusted (including confounders and partner's substance use). The results were meta-analysed across the cohorts. Secondly, we used polygenic risk scores (PRS) as proxies for exposures. Maternal PRS for smoking, alcohol and coffee consumption were regressed against ADHD symptoms. We triangulated the results across the two approaches to infer causality.

Setting

We used data from three longitudinal pregnancy cohorts: Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) in the United Kingdom, Generation R study (GenR) in the Netherlands and Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort study (MoBa) in Norway.

Participants

Phenotype data available for children were: N ALSPAC = 5455–7751; N GENR = 1537–3119; N MOBA = 28053–42206. Genotype data available for mothers was: N ALSPAC = 7074; N MOBA = 14583.

Measurements

A measure of offspring ADHD symptoms at age 7–8 years was derived by dichotomizing scores from questionnaires and parental self-reported prenatal substance use was measured at the second pregnancy trimester.

Findings

The pooled estimate for maternal prenatal substance use showed an association with total ADHD symptoms [odds ratio (OR) SMOKING = 1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.00–1.23; OR ALCOHOL = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.08–1.49; OR CAFFEINE = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.00–1.11], while not for fathers (OR SMOKING = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.95–1.13; OR ALCOHOL = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.47–1.48; OR CAFFEINE = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.97–1.07). However, maternal associations did not persist in sensitivity analyses (substance use before pregnancy, adjustment for maternal ADHD symptoms in MoBa). The PRS analyses were inconclusive for an association in ALSPAC or MoBa.

Conclusions

There appears to be no causal intrauterine effect of maternal prenatal substance use on offspring attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms.

### Impact of exposure to parental attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder on clinical features and dysfunction in the offspring [^1134PLTT]. Psychological Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Although genes are known to influence the aetiology of ADHD, the impact of exposure to parental ADHD has received limited scientific scrutiny. This study investigated the impact of exposure to parental ADHD on clinical features and dysfunction in offspring.

Methods

We studied 1099 offspring (53% male, mean age 12.4 years) of non-ADHD, remitted ADHD, and persistent ADHD parents, using structured diagnostic interviews and a battery of cognitive and psychosocial measures. Offspring across these three groups were compared on clinical, cognitive and psychosocial outcomes, adjusting for exposure to other parental psychopathology, offspring ADHD status and social class.

Results

Parental ADHD was associated with an increased risk for ADHD in offspring relative to no parental ADHD, but no significant differences were found between children of remitted versus persistent ADHD parents. Exposure to parental ADHD predicted higher levels of family conflict and lesser levels of family cohesion relative to families without parental ADHD, independent of other psychopathological conditions in parents or ADHD status. Significant interactions were detected in which parental ADHD had a deleterious impact on measures of school performance in offspring without ADHD but not in those with the disorder.

Conclusions

These results find no support for the hypothesis that exposure to parental ADHD increases the risk for ADHD in children beyond that conveyed by the liability associated with the diagnosis in the parent. However, since exposure to parental ADHD was associated with a disruptive family environment, the identification and treatment of adults with ADHD may be an important component of the treatment plan of youth with ADHD.

### Association of exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals during adolescence with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder-related behaviors [^111PhynH]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

In a population with a high prevalence of ADHD-related behaviors, our findings support an association of adolescent exposure to EDCs, particularly select phthalates, with an increased risk of significant ADHD-related behavior problems at exposure biomarker concentrations typical of adolescents in the general US population. These results are consistent with previously reported findings in the New Bedford Cohort associating adolescent EDC exposure, particularly to antiandrogenic phthalates, with increased externalizing behaviors (a BASC-2 composite of hyperactivity, aggression, and conduct problems).

Previous studies have reported associations of prenatal and early postnatal exposure to phthalates and BPA with an increase in ADHD-related behaviors. However, to our knowledge, no other published studies have analyzed associations between adolescent EDC biomarker concentrations and ADHD-related behaviors. Adolescence is a critical period for brain development and may be another time of heightened vulnerability to EDC exposure. Several cross-sectional studies (with children of wide age ranges, including some adolescents) have reported associations between increased urinary phthalate and BPA concentrations and ADHD-related behaviors. Experimental animal studies also support the potential for EDC exposures to be associated with adverse behavior in adolescence, including behaviors consistent with ADHD. Furthermore, there is well-established evidence demonstrating the unique association that neurotoxicant exposures (eg, alcohol and organophosphates) during adolescence have with adverse behavior.

This analysis focused on ADHD-related behaviors as opposed to clinical ADHD diagnosis. By relying on multiple indices of ADHD-related behavior (from the BASC-2 and CADS) from multiple observers (teachers, parents, and self), we were able to leverage a uniquely comprehensive characterization of adolescent behavior, including behaviors that can vary over time (eg, inattention) and thus may be susceptible to variations in exposure risk factors. In particular, combining information from these multiple measures increased the power of our analysis, resulting in more stable estimates of association than would have been possible by examining each behavioral measure individually. In addition, by expressing multiple measures as a single outcome, we did not induce the statistical issues associated with multiple comparisons.

### Genetic variations influence brain changes in patients with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [^113yoiW3]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurological and neurodevelopmental childhood-onset disorder characterized by a persistent pattern of inattentiveness, impulsiveness, restlessness, and hyperactivity. These symptoms may continue in 55–66% of cases from childhood into adulthood. Even though the precise etiology of ADHD is not fully understood, it is considered as a multifactorial and heterogeneous disorder with several contributing factors such as heritability, auxiliary to neurodevelopmental issues, severe brain injuries, neuroinflammation, consanguineous marriages, premature birth, and exposure to environmental toxins. Neuroimaging and neurodevelopmental assessments may help to explore the possible role of genetic variations on ADHD neuropsychobiology. Multiple genetic studies have observed a strong genetic association with various aspects of neuropsychobiological functions, including neural abnormalities and delayed neurodevelopment in ADHD. The advancement in neuroimaging and molecular genomics offers the opportunity to analyze the impact of genetic variations alongside its dysregulated pathways on structural and functional derived brain imaging phenotypes in various neurological and psychiatric disorders, including ADHD. Recently, neuroimaging genomic studies observed a significant association of brain imaging phenotypes with genetic susceptibility in ADHD. Integrating the neuroimaging-derived phenotypes with genomics deciphers various neurobiological pathways that can be leveraged for the development of novel clinical biomarkers, new treatment modalities as well as therapeutic interventions for ADHD patients. In this review, we discuss the neurobiology of ADHD with particular emphasis on structural and functional changes in the ADHD brain and their interactions with complex genomic variations utilizing imaging genetics methodologies. We also highlight the genetic variants supposedly allied with the development of ADHD and how these, in turn, may affect the brain circuit function and related behaviors. In addition to reviewing imaging genetic studies, we also examine the need for complementary approaches at various levels of biological complexity and emphasize the importance of combining and integrating results to explore biological pathways involved in ADHD disorder. These approaches include animal models, computational biology, bioinformatics analyses, and multimodal imaging genetics studies.

### Twenty-year trends in diagnosed attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder among US children and adolescents, 1997–2016 [^115YCZrE]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

It remains to be understood how much of the observed apparent increase in diagnosed ADHD was attributed to etiologic factors; ADHD has a genetic component with an estimated heritability of 70% to 80%. In addition to genetic risk factors, environmental risk factors are believed to contribute to the development of ADHD. Prenatal and perinatal risk factors, including preterm birth, low birth weight, maternal cigarette smoking, and maternal use of certain medications or illicit substances during pregnancy, have been associated with ADHD risk. Attachment-related factors in early infancy have also been associated with ADHD in childhood. Environmental contamination, such as lead, organophosphate pesticides, and polychlorinated biphenyls exposure, during prenatal and/or postnatal periods is a possible risk factor for ADHD. In addition, nutritional deficiencies (eg, zinc, magnesium, and polyunsaturated fatty acids) may also be implicated in the development of ADHD. The contributions of these nongenetic and genetic risk factors to the etiologic source of ADHD, both separately and jointly, warrant further investigation.

Strengths and Limitations

This study has several strengths. First, this study was based on a nationally representative sample of the US population, which facilitates the generalization of the findings to a broader population. Second, a large sample size with a multi-racial/ethnic diverse population was available, allowing us to assess disparities in ADHD prevalence according to population characteristics. Third, with a series of nationwide population-based cross-sectional surveys, we were able to evaluate the secular trends in ADHD prevalence over a period of observations as long as 20 years.

This study has some limitations. First, ADHD was ascertained by parent-reported physicians' diagnosis, which may be subject to misreporting and recall bias. Second, we did not know whether the children and adolescents with a diagnosis of ADHD still had ADHD at the time of the survey across the survey years except in NHIS 2016. Previous studies have shown that the core symptoms of ADHD tend to decline with age, but inattentive features of ADHD are more likely to persist. In NHIS 2016, we found that 85% of children and adolescents with a history of ADHD diagnosis were reported as currently having ADHD, which was similar to the number reported in a previous study.

### Prenatal smoking, alcohol and caffeine exposure and offspring externalizing disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111BvJ2C]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Several studies have indicated that maternal health behaviours during pregnancy, including smoking, alcohol and caffeine consumption, may contribute to offspring externalizing problems [such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder (CD) and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD)]. However, it remains unclear whether this reflects a true causal effect or residual confounding due to factors such as socio‐economic position, education, income and maternal age. This is of considerable public health importance as smoking, alcohol and caffeine consumption are common exposures, and although current UK guidelines recommend abstaining from smoking and alcohol consumption and limiting daily caffeine consumption to 200 mg during pregnancy, most women still use these substances at some point in pregnancy.

A recent systematic review, focused upon alcohol exposure and various offspring mental health outcomes, found evidence of an association between low to moderate maternal prenatal alcohol use and offspring behavioural and conduct problems. Similarly, systematic reviews and meta‐analyses report an association between maternal prenatal smoking and offspring CD and ADHD. However, these reviews are based on conventional observational studies which do not provide strong evidence of causality, given limitations such as unmeasured and residual confounding. The only review to date to triangulate evidence from different study designs, many of which are robust to confounding, concluded that there was no strong evidence for an effect of maternal prenatal alcohol use on behavioural phenotypes including ADHD. In addition to socio‐economic confounding, the observed associations could also be explained by shared genetic influences (i.e.g.enetic confounding). Several studies report shared genetic liability between ADHD, CD and substance use and maternal genetic risk for ADHD has been associated with smoking during pregnancy. Therefore, it is possible that the association between maternal prenatal substance use and offspring externalizing disorders could be explained by genetic transmission. These reviews highlight the need for further investigation into the effect of maternal prenatal substance use on offspring externalizing problems and the use of genetically informative study designs to disentangle potential causal effects.

We systematically reviewed the evidence for association between prenatal smoking, alcohol and caffeine exposure and diagnosis of ADHD, CD and ODD. With our aim being to more clearly understand possible causal pathways, we specifically included studies accounting for genetic effects, in addition to conventional approaches. We chose to include these three highly comorbid externalizing disorders to allow the interrogation of both common and specific effects of prenatal substance exposures, and prioritized clinical diagnoses over symptoms scales to avoid reporting bias.

### ADHD and pregnancy [^115REMF2]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been increasingly recognized and treated in children and adults in recent years. As a result, a growing number of women enter their reproductive years treated with medication for ADHD or are diagnosed and start medication during their reproductive years. A common question in perinatal psychiatry regards the risk-benefit profile of pharmacotherapy for ADHD, particularly with stimulants. At this time, there are no guidelines to inform the treatment of ADHD across pregnancy and the postpartum period. Concerns about in utero exposure to stimulants are based primarily on the impact these medications might have on fetal growth. While stimulants do not appear to be associated with major congenital malformations, more human data regarding potential behavioral teratogenicity are needed in order to understand both the short- and long-term risks. Severity of illness, presence of comorbid disorders, and degree of impairment have an impact on treatment decisions. Crucial considerations include driving safety and ability to function in occupational roles. While most women can successfully avoid the use of stimulant medication during pregnancy, there are cases in which the benefits of stimulant treatment outweigh known and putative risks of in utero medication exposure.

### Association between maternal exposure to magnetic field nonionizing radiation during pregnancy and risk of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in offspring in a longitudinal birth cohort [^111A8enN]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Approximately 11% of all children aged 4 to 17 years (> 6.4 million children) in the United States receive a diagnosis of, or treatment for, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder has been associated with poor school performance during childhood and with lifelong disabilities. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the annual costs associated with ADHD treatment and care are estimated at $42 billion, (and as high as $124 billion when burden to the family is included). The most troubling aspect of pediatric ADHD is that its prevalence has been steadily increasing during the last few decades, with acceleration since 2000. Without ruling out genetic susceptibility, such a secular increase points to the presence of important environmental risk factors.

One of the most relevant time windows for environmental risk factors to be associated with brain development is during pregnancy, when fetal brain development is susceptible to external insults that could have a long-lasting effect on brain function and neurobehavior. Among the limited research into the causes of ADHD associated with in utero environmental exposures, to our knowledge, the focus has thus far been on chemicals. One nonchemical factor that has not been examined is the ever-present nonionizing radiation, also known as magnetic fields (MFs), emitted from electric appliances, power lines, and wireless devices and networks including cell phone towers. Emerging human studies have begun to report that maternal exposure to MF nonionizing radiation during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of several childhood illnesses, including immune-related conditions (such as asthma), obesity, and neurologic conditions (such as ADHD). An experimental studyprovided further evidence of (1) the direct link between in utero exposure to MF nonionizing radiation and ADHD in offspring and (2) a potential mechanism linking in utero exposure of MF nonionizing radiation with ADHD through altered neuronal developmental programming. Additional evidence from experimental animal studies has also recently been reported. Finally, a JAMA report showed that MF nonionizing radiation could affect human brain cell functions. The emerging evidence indicates that (1) there is a potentially adverse biological association between in utero exposure to MF nonionizing radiation and the health of offspring and (2) fetal brain development and programming is likely one of the vulnerable targets associated with in utero exposure to MF nonionizing radiation.

### Blood lead concentrations and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in Korean children: a hospital-based case control study [^111H73jx]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Because the developing brain of a child is vulnerable to environmental toxins, even very low concentration of neurotoxin can affect children's neurodevelopment. Lead is a neurotoxic heavy metal which has the harmful effect on the striatal-frontal circuit of brain. This area of the brain is known to be closely related to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) pathophysiology. The primary objective of the present study was to investigate whether elevated blood lead concentration is a risk factor for ADHD. The secondary objective was to examine the association between blood lead concentration and symptom severity.

Methods

We conducted a frequency-matched, hospital-based case-control study with 114 medically diagnosed ADHD cases and 114 controls. The participants were matched for age and sex. The diagnoses of ADHD were assessed with semi-structured diagnostic interviews. The participants completed the continuous performance test (CPT), and their parents completed the ADHD-rating scale (ADHD-RS). Blood lead concentrations were measured by using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry featuring Zeeman background correction.

Results

Children with ADHD exhibited blood lead concentrations that were significantly higher than those of the controls (1.90 ± 086 μg/dℓ vs. 1.59 ± 0.68 μg/dℓ, p = 0.003). The log transformed total blood lead concentration was associated with a higher risk of ADHD (OR: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.04–2.45, p < 0.05). The analysis also revealed that the children with blood lead concentrations above 2.30 μg/dℓ were at a 2.5-fold (95% CI: 1.09–5.87, p < 0.05) greater risk of having ADHD. After adjusting for covariates, our multivariate regression models indicated that blood lead concentrations were not significantly associated with ADHD-RS or CPT profiles among the ADHD cases.

Conclusion

Even low blood lead concentrations are a risk factor for ADHD in children. This study warrants primary prevention policies to reduce the environmental lead burden. Future studies may be required to ascertain the effects of lead on symptom severity in ADHD.

### Associations of prenatal metal exposure with child neurodevelopment and mediation by perturbation of metabolic pathways [^111ipeFC]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

The developing brain is particularly vulnerable to environmental pollutants, and even low exposure levels can induce adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes –. Maternal exposure to metals, such as lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd), has been linked to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in children, including impaired cognitive development and behavior development, as well as an elevated risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, previous studies have primarily focused on single toxic metals (e.g. Pb, Cd) or mixtures of several metals, and the effects of mixed metal exposure remain inconclusive. Moreover, the biological mechanisms linking prenatal exposure to mixed metals and children's neurodevelopment have not yet been fully established. Previous studies have suggested that disruptions of homeostatic processes and bioenergetic disturbances caused by environmental exposures in utero, such as increased oxidative stress and lipid oxidation by high maternal levels of aluminum (Al), Cd, Pb, and manganese (Mn), disturbances of neurotransmission by Al and Mn, mitochondrial dysfunction induced by Pb and Mn, which may be underlying mechanisms leading to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, the majority of these findings are based on several traditional biomarkers, including 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, 8-hydroxyguanosine, malondialdehyde, and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal-mercapturic acid, which provide limited insight into complex biological processes.

### Brain drain: the cost of neglected responsibilities in evaluating cumulative effects of environmental chemicals [^1125uM29]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2015). Low credibility.

Developmental disabilities affect millions of people and have a great impact on their lives, their families and the societies where they live. The prevalence of disorders such as autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder as well as subclinical decrements in brain function cannot be explained solely as genetic diseases. Exposures to environmental chemicals, especially during prenatal and early postnatal life, are one likely explanation for some of the decrements. The current chemical risk assessment approach is typically based on the toxicity caused by a single chemical on a variety of organs without acknowledging additional exposures to other chemicals also affecting the same organ or system. We identified more than 300 chemicals allowed in food that may have potential harmful effects on the developing brain. Each individual chemical may or may not have a harmful effect if it were the only one present, but we know next to nothing about their cumulative biological effects on the brain. An expanded cumulative risk assessment approach is needed, and it should focus on health outcomes, like developmental disabilities, arising from the accumulation of effects of multiple chemicals on the brain. The laws regulating the safety of additives already require that regulators in Europe and the USA consider cumulative effects; so far, they seem to have neglected the mandate. We must move beyond treating chemical exposures as isolated incidents and look at their cumulative biological effects on organs and their role in the onset of chronic diseases. The time has come to overhaul chemical risk assessment.

### The impact of early life exposure to air pollution on the brain: a diffusion MRI study in 10–13-year-old children with and without ADHD diagnosis [^116jntC9]. Human Brain Mapping (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Exposure to outdoor air pollution is one of the largest environmental risks to human health (WHO). Residents of highly polluted areas face increased rates of various diseases, including stroke, elevated blood pressure, and heart rate issues (de Bont et al; Konduracka and Rostoff), pulmonary disease (Duan et al.) and asthma (Paciência et al.). Pollutants like polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), and particulate matter (PM) can disrupt brain maturation, potentially causing neurodevelopmental disturbances (Cory‐Slechta et al; Herting et al; Morrel et al; Parenteau et al; Polemiti et al; Szwed et al.). Exposure to PM may interfere with cellular mechanisms in neurons (e.g. inflammation/microglia activation) resulting in neurodevelopmental delay or long‐term impairment (Morris et al.), potentially leading to altered cognitive functions. Several studies have shown that elevated levels of air pollution are associated with cognitive deficits in children, particularly in attention and executive function (Compa et al; Forns et al; Margolis et al; Pujol, Fenoll, et al; Sunyer et al.). There is also growing evidence that early‐life exposure to traffic‐related air pollution is linked to an increased risk of attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Liu et al; Thygesen et al.), a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by impairments in attention regulation, impulsivity, and executive functioning.

### Individual and combined association between prenatal polysubstance exposure and childhood risk of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^114xFhYf]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition diagnosed in approximately 1 in 10 children as of 2016. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder has numerous known sequelae that persist from childhood to adulthood, including increased risk of other mental health disorders, lower employment and educational attainment, and higher all-cause, and suicide-specific mortality, despite recent improvements in treatment strategies. Identification of modifiable risk factors in the prenatal and early-life periods may provide new avenues for prevention efforts. It may also improve early detection of individuals at high risk to complement existing treatment, which could ultimately address disabilities associated with ADHD and improve long-term health outcomes.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder has known environmental risks in the critical period of development during gestation. Multiple substance exposures during gestation have been associated with the risk of ADHD and other neurological outcomes. Tobacco exposure during pregnancy has been found to have persistent associations with the risk of childhood ADHD, with 1 study finding an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.48. Alcohol consumption, (1 studyfound a relative risk of 1.55) and opioid use (1 studyfound that heroin, oxycodone, or opioid agonists used in cessation therapies were associated with an odds ratio of 2.55) have also been associated with increased risk of ADHD. The use of cannabis has been less frequently examined; however, there is some evidence that cannabis is associated with quantitative attention outcomes, although this association has yet to be formally extrapolated to ADHD diagnosis. Many of these studies, however, had study design limitations, such as recall bias from the use of retrospective designs, examination of specific populations that may not be generalizable to a wider range of children exposed to substances, or lack of adjustment for additional concurrent substance use, which could have produced biased estimates.

### Animal models of childhood exposure to lead or manganese: evidence for impaired attention, impulse control, and affect regulation and assessment of potential therapies [^112T5bpD]. Neurotherapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Behavioral disorders, particularly those involving learning, attention, and impulse control, are among the most prevalent disorders in children. While the etiologies of behavioral disorders are often poorly understood, they are generally recognized to be multifactorial in nature, with epidemiological studies providing evidence for both genetic and environmental risk factors. For example, substantial evidence has emerged over the past several decades supporting associations between various environmental factors and increased risk of behavioral disorders, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in children and adolescents. These environmental risk factors include toxicant exposure, which may vary in magnitude, duration, and life stage, and interact with genetic predisposition.

The reported associations between environmental exposures and increased risk for behavioral disorders have raised significant public health concerns, in part because of the profound disability produced by these disorders, but also because infants are especially vulnerable to environmental toxicants due to susceptible neurodevelopmental processes unique to early life stages. For example, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is uniquely vulnerable to early life insults, often manifesting as impairments in attention and impulse control. These reports underscore the need to understand how developmental exposure to environmental toxicants impacts neurobehavioral function and contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders, in order to devise effective intervention and treatment strategies.

### Prenatal pet keeping and caregiver-reported attention deficit hyperactivity disorder through preadolescence in a United States birth cohort [^115pXEa9]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The keeping of pets has been shown to have a variety of both positive and negative health effects. Children exposed to pets during early life are less likely to develop allergic diseases as well as obesity. However, little is known regarding the association between pet keeping and neurodevelopmental disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), with limited published studies showing positive and null associations between pet keeping and neurodevelopmental disorders or measures of related symptoms.

Pets may influence neurodevelopment via several pathways. Pets are associated with changes in the gut microbiome of members of their household. The gut microbiome may influence risk of ADHD via the gut-brain axis. Additionally, pets may introduce environmental toxicants (e.g. pesticides) into the home, and pesticide exposure may be a risk factor for ADHD. Finally, attachment to a pet may impact emotional development; emotional dysregulation is a feature of ADHD.

ADHD is a complex disorder hallmarked by hyperactivity, inattention and impulsivity at a developmentally inappropriate level. In the United States, ~ 9.0% of children are affected by ADHD. While there is a large genetic component to ADHD (estimated heritability > 70%), environmental factors also impact the risk of ADHD. Given that ADHD results in a sizeable economic burden and negative impact on quality of life, there is a need for further study of potential environmental risk factors, particularly those in early life.

The goal of this study was to examine if prenatal pet keeping was associated with ADHD in preadolescence (ages ~ 10–12 years). To achieve this goal, we leveraged data from the racially and socioeconomically diverse Wayne County Health, Environment, Allergy and Asthma Longitudinal Study (WHEALS) birth cohort (Detroit, Michigan).

### The nature and heritability of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^112YTQ9C]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

This article reviews family, twin, and adoption studies, along with segregation analyses and molecular genetic studies, suggesting that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the etiology of ADHD. Findings also indicate that the genetic mechanisms that predispose individuals to ADHD are likely to be complex, and the literature on ADHD raises many questions regarding clinical and pathophysiologic heterogeneity of the disorder. Although there is no single pathophysiologic profile of ADHD, data do implicate dysfunction in the frontosubcortical pathways that control attention and motor behavior. Moreover, the effectiveness of stimulants, along with animal models of hyperactivity, point to catecholamine dysregulation as at least one source of ADHD brain dysfunction.

### Urinary trichlorophenol levels and increased risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder among US school-aged children [^113QR949]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by pervasive inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity causing significant functional impairments. The prevalence of ADHD ranges from 3% to 8% in US school-aged children, accounting for 4–5 million ADHD cases among children aged 4–17 years, and has dramatically increased during the past two decades. Despite the increasing prevalence, the aetiology and biological mechanisms of ADHD. Known risk factors associated with increased risk of ADHD in children include genetic factors and a wide range of environmental toxins including lead, mercury and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS).

However, PubMed and Google Scholar searches combining the MeSH key terms, 'attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'ADHD', 'trichlorophenols' and 'TCP', and review of the references of relevant articles identified no published studies on TCPs and ADHD in the peer-reviewed literature. Therefore, we used the 1999–2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data to evaluate the associations between urinary TCPs and ADHD among US children.

### Association of tobacco and lead exposures with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^116n1my9]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The study objective was to determine the independent and joint associations of prenatal tobacco and childhood lead exposures with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), as defined by current diagnostic criteria, in a national sample of US children.

Methods

Data are from the 2001–2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a cross-sectional, nationally representative sample of the US population. Participants were 8 to 15 years of age (N = 2588). Prenatal tobacco exposure was measured by report of maternal cigarette use during pregnancy. Lead exposure was assessed by using current blood lead levels. The Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children was used to ascertain the presence of ADHD in the past year, on the basis of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria.

Results

A total of 8.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.3%-10.1%) of children met criteria for ADHD. Prenatal tobacco exposure (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.4 [95% CI: 1.5–3.7]) and higher current blood lead concentrations (aOR for third versus first tertile: 2.3 [95% CI: 1.5–3.8]) were independently associated with ADHD. Compared with children with neither exposure, children with both exposures (prenatal tobacco exposure and third-tertile lead levels) had an even greater risk of ADHD (aOR: 8.1 [95% CI: 3.5–18.7]) than would be expected if the independent risks were multiplied (tobacco-lead exposure interaction term, P < .001).

Conclusions

Prenatal tobacco and childhood lead exposures are associated with ADHD in US children, especially among those with both exposures. Reduction of these common toxicant exposures may be an important avenue for ADHD prevention.

### Association of exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals during adolescence with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder-related behaviors [^114sSn14]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Methods

Study Population

We analyzed data from the New Bedford Cohort, a prospective birth cohort of mother-infant pairs recruited after delivery at a New Bedford, Massachusetts, hospital between 1993 and 1998. The original aim of the study was to examine the association of prenatal organochlorine and metal exposures with subsequent neurodevelopment among children living near the New Bedford Harbor Superfund site. Eligibility requirements included newborns who were vaginally delivered to mothers who were at least 18 years of age and who were available for neonatal examination. In-person neurodevelopmental testing was performed when participants were approximately 15 years of age between 2008 and 2014. Of the 788 newborns enrolled in the New Bedford Cohort, 660 (84%) met eligibility criteria (residence in the study region, absence of catastrophic central nervous system injury or disease, available biomarkers of early chemical exposure, and contact information) for these assessments and, of those newborns, 528 (80%) completed assessments. Midway through the 15-year follow-up, the study added assessment of exposure to EDCs. We invited the 252 participants who were evaluated in this last half of the study to provide spot urine samples at 2 points: during neurodevelopmental assessments and approximately 1 week later (mean duration of time after assessment, 7 days [range, 1–35 days]) (eFigure in the Supplement). This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline. The study research protocol was reviewed and approved by the human participants committee of the Brigham and Women's Hospital (Boston, Massachusetts). Written informed parental consent and child assent were obtained from participants. The analysis of deidentified specimens at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) laboratory (Atlanta, Georgia) was determined not to constitute engagement in human participants research.

### Maternal lifestyle factors in pregnancy risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and associated behaviors: review of the current evidence [^113FzKde]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this review was to examine the literature assessing the relationship between prenatal exposure to nicotine, alcohol, caffeine, and psychosocial stress during pregnancy to the risk of developing behavioral problems related to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in childhood.

Method

PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO were searched systematically. Studies using DSM diagnostic criteria and other validated diagnostic or screening instruments for ADHD and those examining ADHD symptoms were included. A narrative approach was used because the studies differed too much in methods and data sources to permit a quantitative meta-analysis.

Results

Twenty-four studies on nicotine (tobacco smoking), nine on alcohol, one on caffeine, and five on psychosocial stress were identified. All were published between 1973 and 2002. In spite of inconsistencies, the studies on nicotine indicated a greater risk of ADHD-related disorders among children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy. Contradictory findings were reported in the alcohol studies, and no conclusion could be reached on the basis of the caffeine study. Results from studies on psychological stress during pregnancy were inconsistent but indicated a possible modest contribution to ADHD symptoms in the offspring. Many studies suffered from methodological shortcomings, such as recall bias, crude or inaccurate exposure assessments, low statistical power, and lack of or insufficient control of confounders. A general lack of information on familial psychopathology also limited the interpretations.

Conclusions

Exposure to tobacco smoke in utero is suspected to be associated with ADHD and ADHD symptoms in children. Other maternal lifestyle factors during pregnancy may also be associated with these disorders. Further studies are needed to reach conclusions.

### Early-life injuries and the development of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^115eMDTG]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

To conclude, our study adds important new findings to the literature on what characterizes children with ADHD, years before they are diagnosed and the data suggest that early-life injuries may be an early manifestation of impairment and risks related to symptoms of ADHD. Furthermore, the observed association between early-life injuries and ADHD is partly due to shared familial and genetic risks.

### Association of prenatal exposure to valproate and other antiepileptic drugs with risk for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in offspring [^111CsYqU]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Antiepileptic drug (AED) exposure during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk for congenital malformations, and delayed cognitive development in the offspring. However, to our knowledge, only 5 small studies and a meta-analysis of these studies including a total of 816 persons with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have examined a possible association between prenatal exposure to valproate and ADHD in the offspring.,

Although the heritability of ADHD has been estimated to be 75%and specific molecular genetic markers of ADHD have now been identified, a variety of environmental factors may also be associated with an increased risk of ADHD. Prenatal valproate exposure may be associated with ADHD, although previous studies showed no clear evidence of this. If so, this would be a modifiable environmental exposure and of major importance for women of childbearing potential using valproate.

In this large population-based prospective cohort study, we evaluated the association between maternal use of valproate and other AEDs during pregnancy and the risk of ADHD in the offspring, taking maternal history of epilepsy and psychiatric conditions into account.

### Blood lead concentrations and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in Korean children: a hospital-based case control study [^114yQtp2]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Because the developing brain of a child is vulnerable to environmental toxins, even very low concentration of neurotoxin can affect children's neurodevelopment. Lead is a neurotoxic heavy metal which has the harmful effect on the striatal-frontal circuit of brain. This area of the brain is known to be closely related to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) pathophysiology. The primary objective of the present study was to investigate whether elevated blood lead concentration is a risk factor for ADHD. The secondary objective was to examine the association between blood lead concentration and symptom severity.

Methods

We conducted a frequency-matched, hospital-based case-control study with 114 medically diagnosed ADHD cases and 114 controls. The participants were matched for age and sex. The diagnoses of ADHD were assessed with semi-structured diagnostic interviews. The participants completed the continuous performance test (CPT), and their parents completed the ADHD-rating scale (ADHD-RS). Blood lead concentrations were measured by using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry featuring Zeeman background correction.

Results

Children with ADHD exhibited blood lead concentrations that were significantly higher than those of the controls (1.90 ± 086 μg/dℓ vs. 1.59 ± 0.68 μg/dℓ, p = 0.003). The log transformed total blood lead concentration was associated with a higher risk of ADHD (OR: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.04–2.45, p < 0.05). The analysis also revealed that the children with blood lead concentrations above 2.30 μg/dℓ were at a 2.5–fold (95% CI: 1.09–5.87, p < 0.05) greater risk of having ADHD. After adjusting for covariates, our multivariate regression models indicated that blood lead concentrations were not significantly associated with ADHD-RS or CPT profiles among the ADHD cases.

Conclusion

Even low blood lead concentrations are a risk factor for ADHD in children. This study warrants primary prevention policies to reduce the environmental lead burden. Future studies may be required to ascertain the effects of lead on symptom severity in ADHD.

### Animal models of childhood exposure to lead or manganese: evidence for impaired attention, impulse control, and affect regulation and assessment of potential therapies [^116yqtYp]. Neurotherapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

A focus of our work, and an emphasis in this review, is the development of animal models using behavioral tests that recapitulate the various phenotypic features of behavioral disorders in children, including impairments in attention, impulse control, and arousal regulation. In particular, our focus has been to elucidate the role that the neurotoxicants lead (Pb) and manganese (Mn) play in syndromes characterized by these areas of dysfunction. This emphasis is well-justified for several reasons. First, attention and impulse control dysfunction, including ADHD, characterize the most prevalent neurodevelopmental syndrome among children, affecting ~ 5–7% of youths up through age 18 years, and ~ 2–3% of adults. Second, ADHD and related syndromes are associated with substantial economic costs to patients, families, and society as a whole. A final compelling need to better understand the role of environmental neurotoxicants in the etiology of ADHD and related symptoms is that this type of disorder appears to disproportionately affect young people of color, a demographic that often also suffers significant socioeconomic, nutritional, and health disparities, as well as environments with higher pollution burdens compared to the general population.

Environmental Manganese Exposure and ADHD

There is emerging epidemiological evidence that environmental manganese exposure is associated with increased risk of ADHD and/or attention/impulsivity/hyperactivity symptoms in children and adolescents. For example, a recent nationwide population-based registry study of over 600,000 children in Denmark reported that exposure to increasing levels of manganese in drinking water was associated with an increased risk of ADHD-Inattentive subtype. After adjusting for covariates, females exposed to high levels of Mn (> 100 μg/L) at least once during their first 5 years of life had a hazard ratio (HR) for ADHD-I of 1.51, while the HR for males was 1.20 when compared with same-sex individuals with peak exposures < 5 μg/L. Broberg et al. investigated if sex and polymorphisms in manganese transporter genes (SLC30A10 and SLC39A8) influenced the association between manganese exposure and ADHD-related behavioral problems in 645 Italian children aged 11–14 years with a wide range of environmental manganese exposure. They reported differences in associations between environmental manganese levels and neurobehavior between sexes, with girls exhibiting higher (worse) self- and parent-reported Conners' scores in several ADHD-related categories (hyperactivity, inattention, DSM IV Total) at higher environmental manganese levels. For boys, they reported a positive linear relationship with environmental manganese for the parent-reported hyperactivity Conner's outcome. In earlier studies, Shin et al. evaluated the association of ADHD status with manganese exposure assessed in clinic-referred children with ADHD and control children aged 6–15 years, using hair manganese levels as the exposure biomarker. They found that excess exposure or deficiency of manganese was associated with ADHD among children. Hong et al. evaluated blood manganese concentrations and ADHD diagnosis in a general population of Korean children, aged 8–11 years, using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) instrument. They reported that blood manganese levels were more positively correlated with CBCL scores in ADHD children than in the healthy population. Finally, Oulhote et al. used a questionnaire to assess the association between neurobehavioral functions, including attention, and drinking water manganese exposure, using hair manganese levels as the exposure biomarker in Canadian children, and reported that a 1-SD increase in log₁₀ hair manganese levels was associated with a significant difference of − 25% SD in attention. Collectively, these studies support a link between elevated environmental manganese exposure and increased risk of ADHD and/or attention/impulsivity/ hyperactivity symptoms in children and adolescents, although there remains insufficient evidence to support a definite causal relationship.

### What causes attention deficit hyperactivity disorder? [^111uYnaX]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

Maternal smoking, alcohol, drug use and stress/anxiety in pregnancy

Clinical and epidemiological associations show a consistent association (OR = 2.39)and dose–response relationship between prenatal exposure to maternal cigarette smoking (maternal reports and urinary cotinine levels) and offspring ADHD. Although biologically plausible, because smoking is known to have an effect on physiological processes that may create risks relevant to the origins of ADHD, it is difficult to adequately control for familial and social confounds in observational designs. Recent studies suggest that the association with ADHD (but not with lower birth weight) may wholly or substantially represent familial and inherited confounds (gene–environment correlation).

Alcohol is a known teratogen and prenatal exposure to heavy maternal drinking can cause foetal alcohol syndrome, the behavioural aspects of which include symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity. However, associations between less extreme alcohol use in pregnancy and offspring ADHD/ADHD symptoms are inconsistent. Findings are also inconsistent with regard to links with prenatal exposure to illicit drugs.

Maternal stress in pregnancy has also been reported to be associated with offspring ADHD symptoms, although recent work suggests that for ADHD (but not antisocial behaviour or anxiety), this might also reflect inherited links between mother and child (gene–environment correlation) rather than being causal. In summary, with the exception of the extreme phenotype of foetal alcohol syndrome, the evidence that maternally related cigarette and substance use and stress in pregnancy play a major causal role in ADHD remains equivocal, although many of these factors are clearly detrimental for other offspring outcomes.

Low birth weight and prematurity

Most studies, including meta-analyses of premature and/or low birth weight children, find evidence of an association with ADHD (relative risk of 2.64 for ADHD in premature children)and ADHD symptoms/attentional problems. The risk appears to be strongest for extreme prematurity and very low birth weight in relation to inattention symptoms and ADHD inattentive subtype. Some preliminary studies also suggest the likely importance of intrauterine growth restriction (small for gestational age). However it is not known whether low birth weight and/or prematurity and other associated pre/perinatal risks (see table 3) are risk markers of ADHD or whether they are causal. The findings at least suggest the need for heightened awareness of possible ADHD in very premature/low birth weight children.

### Association of maternal neurodevelopmental risk alleles with early-life exposures [^112mGNt4]. JAMA Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

The present study examines the association between neurodevelopmental disorder PRSs and early-life exposures associated with those disorders. We found that maternal risk alleles for neurodevelopmental disorders, primarily ADHD, were associated with some prenatal factors. These findings are in line with those of studies showing substantial associations between genetic factors and environmental experiencesand highlight the need to account for genetic confounding in studies of pregnancy-related exposures and neurodevelopmental disorders.

Only maternal stressful life events during pregnancy and lifetime depression showed consistent associations with PRS for all 3 neurodevelopmental disorders. These associations are in line with previous findings suggesting that some stressful life events are heritableand that stressful life events, depression, and neurodevelopmental disorders share genetic risk factors. Apart from horizontal pleiotropy, a potential explanation for the PRS associations with stressful life events is that maternal traits of neurodevelopmental disorders could be associated with stressful situations, making mothers at high genetic risk for ADHD more likely to encounter stressful events.

Maternal ADHD PRS showed associations with a variety of prenatal factors. Consistent with previous studies, we found that genetic liability for ADHD was associated with higher BMI, younger maternal age at delivery, and smoking. To our knowledge, this study was the first to report that genetic liability to ADHD may also be associated with infections, acetaminophen use, and blood levels of toxins in pregnant mothers. Acetaminophen exposure in pregnancy is of considerable current interest because studies have raised concern about its safety owing to the observed association with offspring ADHD. Our results suggest that mothers with higher ADHD PRS may also be more likely to use acetaminophen in pregnancy. Whether the association between ADHD and acetaminophen use holds after adjusting for shared genetic factors and represents a causal relationship should be assessed in a causally informative mendelian randomization framework and with other genetically informative designs that test and account for horizontal pleiotropy.

### Gene-environment interactions in attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^114jtZPA]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by inattention, impulsivity, and/or hyperactivity in children and adults. Putative environmental risk factors for ADHD include toxin and prenatal smoke exposure, low socioeconomic status, and parental marital instability and discord. Genetic associations with ADHD have been found in the dopaminergic, serotonergic, and noradrenergic neurotransmitter systems, but findings are inconsistent across studies. Herein, we review studies of gene-environment interactions for ADHD to better understand how genetic and environmental risk factors may contribute to the disorder in a nonindependent fashion, which may account in part for the inconsistent findings on genetic associations. Although evidence of interactions between prenatal substance exposure and the dopamine genes DAT1 and DRD4 was found, findings across studies have been mixed. We discuss these findings and the future directions and limitations of current gene-environment research.

### Individual and combined association between prenatal polysubstance exposure and childhood risk of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^114meKWm]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this cohort study is the first to date to examine the association of 4 individual prenatal substance exposures with the risk of ADHD and to systematically assess the consequences of polysubstance exposure. We found ADHD risk was higher among children with prenatal exposure to tobacco smoking or opioids independent of concurrent exposure to other substances. We also found no significant increase in ADHD risk among children with prenatal exposure to cannabis or alcohol after adjusting for exposures to multiple substances. With each additional substance used in pregnancy, there was a 21% increased risk of ADHD, suggesting an additive risk of ADHD with polysubstance exposure. Notably, although we did not find a significant independent association between cannabis exposure and ADHD, children exposed to both cannabis and opioids had a 23% greater risk than expected from either exposure individually. Our results provided information that may be used by clinicians and public health experts to develop more beneficial and efficient intervention strategies to advise pregnant women about the risk of ADHD in their children when these substances are used during pregnancy. This information may be especially important in light of substance use rates in the US; it has been estimated that 5%of the 3.7 millionestimated children born each year have been exposed to an addictive substance during gestation.

We did not find significant associations between either cannabis or alcohol use and the risk of ADHD when controlling for concurrent substances. With regard to prenatal cannabis exposure, these findings were consistent with recent results from a prospective cohort studyexamining all live births in Ontario, Canada, which reported no evidence of an association between cannabis and ADHD. However, cannabis exposure during gestation has been associated with other neurodevelopmental outcomes, including reduced executive and motor function among infants. In addition, prenatal alcohol exposure has previously been reported to have numerous associations with attention-related conditions, and remains the etiological exposure associated with fetal alcohol syndrome, which has major developmental consequences. However, a meta-analysisalso found no evidence of a specific association between alcohol exposure and ADHD. It is possible alcohol and cannabis exposures are most pronounced in early life and may not be specifically associated with clinical ADHD, which is typically diagnosed at age 7 years.

### The prevalence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in psychotic disorders: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111BVoYk]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental condition estimated to affect 5%-8% of children and adolescents, and 2%-6% of adults globally. Individuals with ADHD experience difficulties in directing attention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that are disproportionate to their age-related peers, disrupting their ability to function and participate in the community. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder appears to be particularly prevalent among various psychiatric disorders, including psychotic disorders.

Multiple theories have been proposed to explain the relationship between psychotic disorders and ADHD. One theory suggests that individuals with ADHD are at an elevated risk of developing psychotic disorders due to shared neurodevelopmental and environmental factors, including shared polygenic risk, and perinatal complications. For example, a meta-analysis by Nourredine et al.found that individuals with childhood ADHD have a higher relative risk of developing a subsequent psychotic disorder compared to those without childhood ADHD. Additionally, individuals with a first-degree family history of ADHD are at a higher risk of developing schizophrenia compared to the general population. Neurobiologically, both disorders are linked to dopaminergic dysregulation in the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways. This dysregulation has led to theories suggesting that disruptions in reward systems contribute to trait-based impulsivity and increased substance use, which may mediate the relationship between ADHD and psychosis. Moreover, there is mixed evidence suggesting that amphetamine-based psychostimulants prescribed for ADHD may contribute to the development of positive psychotic symptoms and subsequent psychotic disorders. Lastly, the cognitive impairments commonly observed in both ADHD and psychotic disorders, such as deficits in attention, working memory, and executive function, may contribute to diagnostic overlap, where premorbid cognitive symptoms of psychosis are interpreted as a presentation of ADHD. This diagnostic overlap may occur during the clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis state, where subthreshold symptoms are nonspecific, varied, and may resemble ADHD symptoms before a transition to a full-threshold psychotic disorder.

Epidemiological Evidence Linking Environmental Lead Exposure to ADHD

Whereas there are numerous epidemiological studies reporting associations between elevated lead exposure and adverse cognitive and neurological outcomes in children, relatively few have systematically evaluated associations between lead exposure and attention/impulse control symptoms, including ADHD. Several cross-sectional studies using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in the USA reported that children with elevated blood lead levels were ~ 2–4 times more likely to have been diagnosed with ADHD compared with children with lower blood lead levels. More recently, studies have reported correlations between body lead burden and inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms, and in the case of a relatively recent meta-analysis, higher blood lead levels were associated with a nearly four-fold increase in the odds ratio of ADHD. Finally, Hong et al. reported that, when adjusted for demographic characteristics and other environmental exposures, etc. a ten-fold increase in blood lead concentration was associated with lower Full-Scale IQ and higher parent- and teacher-rated hyperactivity/impulsivity scores and commission errors.

### Individual and combined association between prenatal polysubstance exposure and childhood risk of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^117CYiEn]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is prenatal exposure to multiple substances, alone or in combination, associated with the risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in childhood?

Findings

In this cohort study of 3138 children with and without ADHD, prenatal opioid exposure was significantly associated with the highest childhood risk of ADHD among all substances measured. Interactions between exposure to opioids and cannabis as well as opioids and alcohol were also associated with ADHD risk.

Meaning

This study's findings suggest that it is important to consider prenatal exposure to multiple substances and the interactions between these substances when counseling women regarding substance use during pregnancy.

### Association of exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals during adolescence with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder-related behaviors [^116hGrYJ]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

Our results support the importance of adolescent exposure to EDCs, particularly phthalates, as a potential risk factor for significant ADHD-related behavior problems. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is a common and costly neurobehavioral disorder; US health care and education expenditures associated with ADHD in children and adolescents are estimated to be $38 billion to $72 billion annually, while costs associated with ADHD in adults, including lost wages, are much higher, ranging from $143 billion to $266 billion annually. The identification of modifiable risk factors for ADHD is of great public health importance. These findings contribute new insights into the potential detrimental neurobehavioral outcomes of EDC exposure during adolescence.

### Considering toxic chemicals in the etiology of autism… [^112SPZzV]. publications.aap.org (2022). Medium credibility.

Scientists long recognized that genetic factors contribute to autism etiology, as indicated in family, twin, and genetic studies. 2 Yet twin studies, from which heritability estimates are primarily derived, may inflate the role of genetics as both gene-only and genetic-x–shared-environment influences are summarized as genetic. This pervasive problem also applies to a recent analysis of twin and family studies purporting to demonstrate that the environmental component is an unlikely explanation of both ASD risk and the increase in ASD over time. 3 The environment may act in concert with genetic risk pathways or affect the intrauterine environment directly. In addition, the environment may induce similar epigenetic signatures in twins during gestation. 4 Thus, the shared environment is itself complex and not easily disentangled from shared genetics.

Evidence for Environmental Influence on ASD Risk A large body of evidence, including decades of research on lead and child IQ, indicate a link between toxic environmental exposures and poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes. 5 In animal models and human studies, several toxic chemicals have been implicated in ASD and ASD-related traits and biological markers. 2 Specifically, scientists have found that air pollution exposures during pregnancy and early infancy, at levels typically found in large cities, are associated with autism. 6–8 Several studies suggest that gestational exposures to some neurotoxic and endocrine-disrupting pesticides, including organochlorines, organophosphates, and pyrethroids, increase the chances of an autism diagnosis or autism-related behaviors in children. 9 Evidence is emerging that other toxic chemicals are associated with autism or autism-related behaviors, notably phthalates, ubiquitous chemicals that cause a decrease in testosterone.

10 Some environmental factors may also reduce the probability of autism. For example, folate, a vitamin involved in the manufacture and methylation of DNA, plays a critical role in neurodevelopment. Folic acid supplementation, at appropriate levels, around the time of conception appears protective for autism and may ameliorate the impact of toxic chemicals. 11, 12 In several studies, researchers have found that the associations linking autism with air pollutants, pesticides, and phthalates are stronger among children of women who either did not take folic acid or had higher folate requirements during pregnancy. 10–12. Limiting toxic environmental exposures has the potential to reduce the risk of disabilities associated with autism for future generations.

### The role of the gut-brain axis in attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^113en6F6]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Genetic and environmental factors play a role in the cause and development of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Recent studies have suggested an important role of the gut-brain axis (GBA) and intestinal microbiota in modulating the risk of ADHD. Here, the authors provide a brief overview of the clinical and biological picture of ADHD and how the GBA could be involved in its cause. They discuss key biological mechanisms involved in the GBA and how these may increase the risk of developing ADHD. Understanding these mechanisms may help to characterize novel treatment options via identification of disease biomarkers.
