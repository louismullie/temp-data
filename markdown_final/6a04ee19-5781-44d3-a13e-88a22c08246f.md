## Question

sulfa allergy, antibiotic for skin infection

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to choose empiric antibiotics for skin and soft tissue infections in a patient with a sulfonamide ("sulfa") allergy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about verifying the reported sulfa allergy and clarifying cross-reactivity risks. Then, I should categorize the skin infection phenotype and severity to determine whether MRSA coverage and incision and drainage are indicated. Next, I will map safe, effective non-sulfonamide antibiotic options for nonpurulent cellulitis, purulent abscesses, and severe/complicated infections, including IV regimens. After that, I should address dosing, safety, and stewardship considerations. Finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic, stepwise recommendation while noting when allergy delabeling or challenge might be appropriate and when it is not safe to attempt reuse of TMP‑SMX in true allergy histories.

> Let me first confirm the nature of the reported sulfa allergy, because the management depends on whether the reaction was to a sulfonamide antibiotic versus a nonantimicrobial sulfonamide and whether it was immediate IgE-mediated, a benign delayed exanthem, or a severe cutaneous adverse reaction such as SJS/TEN, which is an absolute contraindication to rechallenge with sulfonamide antimicrobials like TMP‑SMX [^112BrZov] [^1125NNMY]. I should confirm that cross-reactivity between sulfonamide antibiotics and nonantimicrobial sulfonamides is biologically unlikely due to the N1 heterocycle and N4 arylamine uniquely present in sulfonamide antibiotics, although this does not make TMP‑SMX safe in a patient with confirmed sulfonamide antibiotic hypersensitivity [^117W356d] [^1125NNMY].

> I need to ensure I state the regulatory contraindication clearly: trimethoprim‑sulfamethoxazole is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to trimethoprim or sulfonamides, and that labeling, coupled with the clinical risk of severe reactions, should steer us to non‑sulfonamide alternatives when a true sulfonamide antibiotic allergy is present [^1167FBMS]. Hold on, let me verify cross-reactivity language for nonantimicrobial sulfonamides such as thiazides and loop diuretics, because some FDA labels still warn broadly; despite label cautions, clinical immunologic cross-reactivity appears minimal, so avoidance of nonantimicrobial sulfonamides is generally not required solely on the basis of a sulfonamide antibiotic allergy, although our antibiotic selection here must still avoid sulfonamide antimicrobials [^114w41r7] [^115GW6xr] [^117W356d].

> Next, I should review the clinical phenotype and severity because treatment hinges on whether the infection is nonpurulent cellulitis versus purulent abscess and whether there are systemic signs or risk factors requiring MRSA coverage or hospitalization; I need to check SIRS criteria and note that abscesses require incision and drainage, with antibiotics as adjuncts when systemic features or host compromise are present [^111tWNDR]. I will also confirm that IDSA delineates nonpurulent versus purulent disease and escalates therapy in the presence of MRSA risk factors or severe systemic illness that mandates IV therapy and broader coverage.

> Let me now identify drugs we must avoid in a sulfonamide antibiotic allergy. TMP‑SMX is out given the contraindication, and I should be careful with topical silver sulfadiazine for burns because it is a sulfonamide; wait, I initially thought simply "sulfadiazine topical", but to be precise, the commonly used topical burn agent is silver sulfadiazine and it is contraindicated in patients with sulfonamide hypersensitivity, so it should be avoided in this context [^1167FBMS] [^1179RaJy]. I should also remember that various ophthalmic sulfonamides carry similar contraindications, though they are not typically used for SSTI management [^111yxXJg].

> For uncomplicated nonpurulent cellulitis with low MRSA risk where streptococci predominate, I would choose a beta‑lactam such as cephalexin or an antistaphylococcal penicillin like dicloxacillin if there is no beta‑lactam allergy, because these agents provide reliable streptococcal and MSSA coverage without sulfonamide structures [^116aZEV3]. Wait, I initially considered azithromycin as a penicillin‑allergic alternative, but let me reconsider; macrolide resistance among streptococci is substantial and IDSA favors clindamycin rather than macrolides for cellulitis alternatives, so clindamycin is the preferred non‑beta‑lactam option when beta‑lactams cannot be used [^116XRX5P].

> If nonpurulent cellulitis occurs in a patient with MRSA risk factors or there is a need to cover both streptococci and MRSA, I should confirm that clindamycin monotherapy covers both and is reasonable, while doxycycline or minocycline are alternatives for MRSA but may require the addition of amoxicillin for streptococcal coverage when beta‑lactams are tolerated, noting that TMP‑SMX would ordinarily be an option but is excluded here due to sulfa allergy [^116Ubdzu]. I need to ensure that shared decision‑making includes local antibiograms given inducible clindamycin resistance and tetracycline susceptibility patterns, especially in CA‑MRSA prevalent areas [^116XRX5P].

> For purulent infections with abscesses, I should first emphasize incision and drainage, then add antibiotics when systemic signs, multiple or large lesions, immunocompromise, or failure of local measures are present; here, clindamycin is a first‑line non‑sulfonamide choice with evidence for similar cure rates to TMP‑SMX in uncomplicated SSTI, and doxycycline or minocycline are sulfa‑free alternatives active against MRSA when indicated [^111tWNDR] [^116Ubdzu] [^116XRX5P]. Hold on, I should verify that if cultures later show MSSA without MRSA risk after adequate drainage, a switch to cephalexin is appropriate in the absence of beta‑lactam allergy, which aligns with de‑escalation principles [^112PzAt3].

> In severe or complicated SSTI requiring hospitalization, I will now examine IV options that avoid sulfonamides; vancomycin remains a standard for MRSA, with linezolid as an effective IV‑to‑PO switch agent, and daptomycin or ceftaroline as additional MRSA‑active options; tigecycline is an alternative in certain polymicrobial contexts though not first‑line for bacteremia, and for suspected polymicrobial or necrotizing infections, I should combine MRSA therapy with broad Gram‑negative and anaerobic coverage per guideline pathways [^112PzAt3] [^116XRX5P]. If a beta‑lactam cannot be used for the Gram‑negative/anaerobic component, I should confirm that ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole is an accepted alternative pathway in beta‑lactam allergy scenarios for polymicrobial SSTI coverage, with MRSA therapy layered as needed [^115EaHeA] [^112TNn17].

> I should double‑check representative dosing and also correct an omission I see; earlier I stopped at "vancomycin 15–20 mg/kg" without interval, which is incomplete. For uncomplicated cellulitis, cephalexin 500 mg orally four times daily is typical if beta‑lactams are tolerated; clindamycin 300–450 mg orally three times daily or doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily are reasonable sulfa‑free alternatives depending on streptococcal coverage needs; for more severe purulent disease, clindamycin 600 mg IV or PO three times daily is appropriate; and for MRSA requiring IV therapy, vancomycin is commonly dosed with weight‑based regimens targeting pharmacodynamic goals, while the FDA label cites 1,000 mg IV every 12 hours as a reference dose, emphasizing clinical monitoring and adjustment to renal function and targets, which corrects my earlier incomplete statement [^111fKWVK] [^116XRX5P]. Linezolid 600 mg IV or PO every 12 hours provides a sulfa‑free option with excellent oral bioavailability for step‑down in appropriate cases, which I should keep in mind for early transitions [^116XRX5P].

> Next, I should review safety and stewardship trade‑offs because alternatives to beta‑lactams can drive adverse outcomes; clindamycin is associated with increased risks of MRSA and Clostridioides difficile compared with beta‑lactams at a population level, so I need to counsel on diarrhea and reserve it appropriately, balancing this against the necessity to avoid sulfonamides in true allergy [^117LycsR]. Doxycycline entails photosensitivity and should be avoided in pregnancy, linezolid requires vigilance for myelosuppression and serotonergic interactions, and vancomycin necessitates renal monitoring, all of which should be explicitly considered when tailoring therapy and duration per IDSA guidance [^112PzAt3] [^116XRX5P].

> I should confirm whether the reported "sulfa allergy" is accurate, because overreporting is common and management changes dramatically if the label is incorrect; while skin testing for sulfonamides has limited utility, direct or graded drug challenges under expert supervision are the gold standard for many antibiotic allergy evaluations, and referral to Allergy for risk stratification and potential delabeling is reasonable when histories suggest low risk and the clinical need for TMP‑SMX is compelling, though this must never be attempted if there is a history of severe cutaneous adverse reactions [^113WNYMj] [^112BrZov] [^1125NNMY]. But wait, what if the patient truly had SJS/TEN from TMP‑SMX; in that case, I must not rechallenge or desensitize, and I should document the reaction clearly to prevent future exposure, maintaining reliance on non‑sulfonamide alternatives outlined above [^1167FBMS] [^1125NNMY].

> Let me think about topical agents briefly, because I need to avoid pitfalls; silver sulfadiazine is contraindicated in sulfonamide hypersensitivity and should be avoided, whereas topical gentamicin is a sulfa‑free aminoglycoside that can treat certain localized superficial infections when topical therapy is appropriate, though stewardship principles and resistance concerns mean topical antibacterials should be used selectively and not as substitutes for systemic therapy when systemic signs or deep infection exist [^1179RaJy] [^111NELmN] [^11393eSw].

> To synthesize, for a patient with a documented sulfonamide antibiotic allergy and a skin infection, I should treat nonpurulent cellulitis with cephalexin or dicloxacillin when beta‑lactams are tolerated, or clindamycin if not; for nonpurulent cellulitis with MRSA risk, clindamycin monotherapy is reasonable, while doxycycline can be used with added streptococcal coverage if needed; for purulent abscesses, perform incision and drainage and add clindamycin or doxycycline when systemic features or risk factors are present; and for severe or complicated disease, use IV MRSA‑active therapy such as vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, or ceftaroline, broadening to cover Gram‑negatives and anaerobes per clinical scenario, all while avoiding TMP‑SMX and silver sulfadiazine in true sulfonamide antibiotic allergy and re‑evaluating the accuracy of the allergy label when safe and appropriate [^112PzAt3] [^116XRX5P] [^116XRX5P] [^115EaHeA].

For patients with a sulfa allergy who need antibiotics for skin infections, **avoid sulfonamides** (e.g. TMP-SMX) [^1167FBMS] due to the risk of severe reactions [^1125NNMY]. Clindamycin is the **preferred alternative** for MRSA coverage and is effective for uncomplicated skin infections [^116Ubdzu]. Doxycycline or minocycline are also **options for MRSA** [^116XRX5P], but add a beta-lactam (e.g. cephalexin) when streptococcal coverage is required. For severe infections or when oral therapy is inadequate [^1125JJvB], use vancomycin, linezolid, or daptomycin [^112PzAt3]. Base the selection on local resistance patterns and patient-specific factors [^112cLfcS].

## Antibiotics to avoid in sulfa-allergic patients

In sulfa-allergic patients, avoid sulfonamide antibiotics, including **Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)** [^1167FBMS], which is commonly used for skin infections but is contraindicated, as well as sulfadiazine and sulfisoxazole. These agents can cause **severe hypersensitivity reactions**, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and anaphylaxis [^1125NNMY].

---

## Recommended alternative antibiotics

Several **alternative antibiotics** are available for treating skin infections in patients with a sulfa allergy. The choice depends on the suspected or confirmed pathogen, infection severity [^1125JJvB], and patient-specific factors [^112cLfcS].

---

### Clindamycin

- **Spectrum**: Effective against MRSA, MSSA, and streptococci [^1125JJvB].

- **Clinical evidence**: Comparable efficacy to TMP-SMX [^116Ubdzu] for uncomplicated skin infections.

- **Limitations**: Risk of C. difficile infection [^117LycsR] and resistance in some regions.

---

### Tetracyclines (doxycycline, minocycline)

- **Spectrum**: Effective against MRSA and MSSA; limited streptococcal coverage [^1125JJvB].

- **Clinical evidence**: Recommended [^116XRX5P] for MRSA skin infections.

- **Limitations**: Not recommended for pregnant women or children under eight years due to potential adverse effects on bone and teeth development.

---

### Beta-lactam antibiotics (cephalosporins)

Beta-lactam cephalosporins cover **MSSA and streptococci**. First-generation agents such as cephalexin [^1146Pfoc] are recommended for MSSA and streptococcal skin infections [^116aZEV3]. They lack activity against MRSA.

---

### Macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin)

Macrolides provide activity against **MSSA and streptococci** and may be used in sulfa-allergic patients. They do not cover MRSA, and resistance is common.

---

### Glycopeptides (vancomycin)

Vancomycin covers **MRSA, MSSA, and streptococci** and is recommended for severe MRSA skin infections [^112PzAt3]. It requires intravenous administration with monitoring for nephrotoxicity [^111fKWVK].

---

### Oxazolidinones (linezolid)

Linezolid provides **MRSA, MSSA, and streptococcal coverage** and is recommended for severe MRSA infections [^1125JJvB] [^112PzAt3]. Prolonged therapy carries risks of myelosuppression and serotonin syndrome.

---

### Lipopeptides (daptomycin)

Daptomycin is active against **MRSA, MSSA, and streptococci** and is recommended for severe MRSA infections [^116XRX5P] [^112PzAt3]. It requires intravenous administration with monitoring for muscle toxicity.

---

## Clinical considerations and precautions

When selecting antibiotics for sulfa-allergic patients, **consider the following**:

- **Severity of allergy**: Avoid sulfonamide antibiotics in patients with severe reactions (e.g. SJS, TEN, anaphylaxis) [^1167FBMS].

- **Cross-reactivity**: Minimal cross-reactivity exists between sulfonamide antibiotics and non-antibiotic sulfonamides (e.g. thiazide diuretics, loop diuretics) [^1125NNMY] [^117W356d].

- **Patient-specific factors**: Consider renal and hepatic function, pregnancy status, and age when selecting antibiotics [^112SXE2M].

- **Local resistance patterns**: Base antibiotic selection on local antimicrobial resistance data [^112cLfcS].

### Sulfatrim [^1167FBMS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to trimethoprim or sulfonamides, in patients with a history of drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia with the use of trimethoprim and/or sulfonamides, and in patients with documented megaloblastic anemia due to folate deficiency. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is also contraindicated in pregnant patients and nursing mothers, as sulfonamides pass the placenta and are excreted in the milk, potentially causing kernicterus. Furthermore, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension is contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 2 months of age. It is also contraindicated in patients with marked hepatic damage or with severe renal insufficiency when renal function status cannot be monitored.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^116XRX5P]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

For empirical coverage of CA-MRSA in outpatients with SSTI, oral antibiotic options include clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), a tetracycline (doxycycline or minocycline), and linezolid. If coverage for both β-hemolytic streptococci and CA-MRSA is required, options include clindamycin alone or TMP-SMX or a tetracycline in association with a β-lactam (e.g. amoxicillin) or linezolid alone.

For hospitalized patients with severe SSTI, in addition to surgical debridement and broad-spectrum antibiotics, empirical therapy for MRSA should be considered, pending culture data. Options include intravenous (IV) vancomycin, PO or IV linezolid 600 mg twice daily, daptomycin 4 mg/kg/dose IV once daily, clindamycin 600 mg IV or PO 3 times a day, tigecycline 100 mg IV LD, then 50 mg twice daily.

Glycopeptides have been, for many years, the microbiological agents of choice for difficult Gram-positive infections. Fortunately, staphylococcal resistance to glycopeptides remains rare, although rising minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of glycopeptides may affect the efficacy of these antibiotics.

Increased resistance to glycopeptides has encouraged the development of new agents active against Gram-positive bacteria, particularly for severe soft tissue infections where aggressive antimicrobial management is always recommended, such as linezolid, tigecycline, and daptomycin. Linezolid has been considered an agent of choice in complicated skin and soft-tissue infections (cSSTIs); it has the advantages of an early intravenous-to-oral switch with the oral preparation.

### Clindamycin versus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for uncomplicated skin infections [^116Ubdzu]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Skin and skin-structure infections are common in ambulatory settings; however, the efficacy of various antibiotic regimens in the era of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is unclear.

- **Methods**: We enrolled outpatients with uncomplicated skin infections who had cellulitis, abscesses larger than 5 cm in diameter (smaller for younger children), or both. Patients were enrolled at four study sites. All abscesses underwent incision and drainage. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either clindamycin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for 10 days. Patients and investigators were unaware of the treatment assignments and microbiologic test results. The primary outcome was clinical cure 7 to 10 days after the end of treatment.

- **Results**: A total of 524 patients were enrolled (264 in the clindamycin group and 260 in the TMP-SMX group), including 155 children (29.6%). One hundred sixty patients (30.5%) had an abscess, 280 (53.4%) had cellulitis, and 82 (15.6%) had mixed infection, defined as at least one abscess lesion and one cellulitis lesion. S. aureus was isolated from the lesions of 217 patients (41.4%); the isolates in 167 (77.0%) of these patients were MRSA. The proportion of patients cured was similar in the two treatment groups in the intention-to-treat population (80.3% in the clindamycin group and 77.7% in the TMP-SMX group; difference, -2.6 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -10.2 to 4.9; P = 0.52) and in the populations of patients who could be evaluated (466 patients; 89.5% in the clindamycin group and 88.2% in the TMP-SMX group).

### Population-based incidence of new ampicillin, cephalexin, cefaclor, and sulfonamide antibiotic "allergies" in exposed individuals with and without preexisting ampicillin, cephalexin, or cefaclor "allergies" [^113G9GxH]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Low credibility.

There is a theoretical concern, unconfirmed by population-based challenge data, that clinically significant, immunologically mediated hypersensitivity occurs among β-lactams sharing side chains.

- **Objective**: To determine the population-based allergy incidence associated with the use of β-lactams sharing exact R1 side chains (ampicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor [ACC]), with or without an ACC allergy or a sulfonamide antibiotic allergy for comparison.

- **Methods**: All courses of ACC and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole used by any Kaiser Permanente California members in 2017 and 2018, with follow-up through January 2019, were identified along with their preexisting antibiotic allergy status and all new antibiotic-specific allergies reported within 30 days of course initiation.

- **Results**: A total of 1,167,713 courses of ACC were administered to individuals with no sulfonamide antibiotic or ACC allergy, and 4,771 new ACC allergies (0.41%) were reported. Moreover, 130,032 courses of ACC were administered to individuals with a sulfonamide antibiotic allergy and no ACC allergy, and 904 new ACC allergies (0.70%) were reported. There were 5,958 courses of ACC administered to individuals with an ACC allergy, 2,341 who also had a sulfonamide antibiotic allergy, and 52 new ACC allergies (0.87%) were reported.

- **Conclusions**: The incidence of new ACC allergy reports is minimally and non-specifically increased among individuals with a preexisting ACC or sulfonamide antibiotic allergy compared to the baseline incidence in the population. This argues against clinically significant…

### Risk of meticillin resistant and in patients with a documented penicillin allergy: Population based matched cohort study [^117LycsR]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

- **Mediation effects of alternative antibiotic use**: Compared with patients who did not receive penicillins, those receiving penicillins did not have an increased risk of MRSA (adjusted risk ratio 1.07, 95% confidence interval 0.95 to 1.20), but had an increased risk of C. difficile (1.18, 1.06 to 1.31). Patients receiving macrolide antibiotics had an increased risk of MRSA (1.72, 1.54 to 1.91), and C. difficile (1.30, 1.18 to 1.43). Patients on clindamycin showed an elevated risk of MRSA (2.97, 2.11 to 4.16), and C. difficile (2.76, 2.00 to 3.81). Those receiving fluoroquinolones also had an increased risk of MRSA (2.38, 2.12 to 2.67), and C. difficile (1.72, 1.54 to 1.93).

The effect of a penicillin allergy on the risk of MRSA was 55% mediated through β-lactam alternative antibiotic classes: 55% through fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, and macrolides; 54% through fluoroquinolones and macrolides; 26% through fluoroquinolones and clindamycin; and 24% through fluoroquinolones alone. The effect of penicillin allergy on C. difficile was 35% mediated through β-lactam alternative antibiotic classes: 26% through fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, and macrolides; 24% through fluoroquinolones and macrolides; 20% through fluoroquinolones and clindamycin; and 16% through fluoroquinolones alone.

### Drug allergy: A 2022 practice parameter update [^1123Hoct]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for drug allergy, particularly in the context of choosing an alternative agent such as analgesics, the AAAAI 2022 guidelines recommend considering the administration of a selective COX-2 inhibitor as an alternative analgesic. This is specifically directed at patients with any NSAID hypersensitivity phenotype when an NSAID is required.

### Current treatment options for acute skin and skin-structure infections [^112pM8B3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

ABSSSIs pose a significant burden to the healthcare system. The challenge of treating these infections has been lessened by the recent development of new antibiotic treatment options that target gram-positive organisms, including MRSA strains. However, new antibiotics that can cover both gram-positive pathogens (including MRSA) and gram-negative pathogens can fulfill an important need in the treatment of selected hospitalized patients with acute skin infections. Examples of such infections include abscesses with mixed bacterial growth, surgical-site infections — particularly those related to abdominal surgery — and selected acute skin infections in patients with diabetes. Furthermore, antibiotics that can offer hospital clinicians additional attributes, such as the flexibility to transition from IV to oral formulation, infrequent dosing, pharmacokinetics that are unaffected by various patient characteristics, a low risk of drug–drug interactions, and no requirement for therapeutic monitoring, will be particularly useful when treating ABSSSIs.

### Current treatment options for acute skin and skin-structure infections [^113QrJ7t]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections (ABSSSIs) are a common reason for seeking care at acute healthcare facilities, including emergency departments. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common organism associated with these infections, and the emergence of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has represented a considerable challenge in their treatment. To address this need, a number of new antibiotics have been developed for the treatment of ABSSSIs in the past several years.

Most of these agents focus primarily on gram-positive organisms, particularly MRSA; however, there has not been an oral agent that can reliably treat MRSA, as well as relevant gram-negative pathogens. Acute skin infections that involve mixed gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens must also be considered as they can be associated with discordant antimicrobial therapy. Here, I review ABSSSI treatment guidelines in the hospital setting and discuss future antibiotic options for the treatment of this commonly encountered infection.

Regarding medical management for cellulitis, specifically related to antibiotic therapy, the IDSA 2014 guidelines recommend administering vancomycin or another antimicrobial agent effective against both MRSA and streptococci in patients with cellulitis and any of the following conditions:

- **Associated penetrating trauma**: Use caution and consider potent antimicrobial therapy.
- **Evidence of MRSA infection elsewhere**: More aggressive treatment may be warranted if signs are present.
- **Nasal colonization with MRSA**: Evaluate appropriate antimicrobial coverage.
- **Injection drug use**: Consider this risk factor when choosing therapy.
- **Sepsis syndrome**: Immediate and appropriate antimicrobial treatment is critical.

### Penicillin allergy in China: Consequences of inappropriate skin testing practices and policies [^115aikiN]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2025). Low credibility.

Penicillins are the most frequently prescribed class of medications worldwide and serve as the first-line antibiotic of choice for most bacterial infections. They are also commonly labeled as the culprit of drug 'allergy', leading to the obligatory use of second-line antibiotics, suboptimal antibiotic therapy, and increased antimicrobial resistance. However, the majority of reported penicillin 'allergy' labels are found to be incorrect after allergy testing, emphasizing the importance of proper drug allergy testing and evaluation.

Penicillin skin testing (PST) remains an important component of drug allergy diagnosis; however, its practice and policies significantly differ across the world. Inappropriate and non-evidence-based PST practices can lead to consequences associated with allergy mislabeling. Even within different regions of China, which has a population exceeding 1.4 billion, there are marked differences in the implementation, execution, and interpretation of PST.

This review aims to examine the differences in PST between Mainland China, Hong Kong, and the rest of the world. We critically analyze the practice of 'pre-emptive' PST in Mainland China, which has a significant false-positive rate leading to high levels of penicillin allergy mislabeling. Non-evidence-based practices further compound the high false-positive rates of indiscriminatory PST. We postulate that inappropriate PST policies and practices may exacerbate the mislabeling of penicillin allergy, leading to the unnecessary overuse of inappropriate second-line antibiotics and increasing antimicrobial resistance.

### Alternative clinical indications for novel antibiotics licensed for skin and soft tissue infection [^1138LN5G]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

A number of novel antibiotics in different classes have been registered and licensed in recent years for complicated skin and soft tissue infections or acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections. Many of these have activity against resistant gram-positive bacteria, including linezolid, daptomycin, oritavancin, dalbavancin, and tedizolid. Additionally, two antibiotics, ceftaroline and tigecycline, have gram-negative activity. The license for the clinical use of these agents is very narrow, but the clinical need is much broader. This is a personal opinion of the prospective clinical roles for these novel antibiotics.

Recent findings indicate that all these antibiotics were found to be noninferior to standard comparators in registration trials. However, there is a paucity of data regarding their use in other clinical conditions outside the narrow confines of these trials. The 'off-label' use of these antibiotics is likely to be more common than their licensed use. Therefore, there is a need to collect data on their clinical and microbiological efficacy and adverse effects in real-life settings.

In summary, there is now a wide range of antibiotics available for treating complicated skin and soft tissue infections or acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections. These antibiotics all have roles in different clinical scenarios, but their use in nonlicensed situations needs further assessment.

### A real-time prospective evaluation of clinical pharmaco-economic impact of diagnostic label of 'penicillin allergy' in a UK teaching hospital [^111JThWU]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to perform a pharmaco-economic analysis of prescribing alternative antibiotics in patients with a diagnostic label of 'penicillin allergy' and assess whether collation of information from a structured history and liaison with the family physician could reduce costs.

The methods involved a prospective pro-forma-based interview of randomly selected in-patients and their family physician to assess the validity of the diagnostic label of 'penicillin allergy'. Cost analysis of prescription of alternative antibiotics was performed and compared with first-line agents.

In the results, 102 patients were assessed and only 40% (n = 41) were found to have a history consistent with penicillin hypersensitivity. Another 40% (n = 41) were likely 'not allergic', and 20% (n = 20) had 'indeterminate' reactions. The total cost of antibiotics prescribed for patients with penicillin allergy was 1.82–2.58-fold higher than for first-line antibiotics.

The conclusions suggest that obtaining a structured history from the patient and family physician alone can enable an accurate identification of penicillin allergy status. The total acquisition cost of second-line antibiotics is higher than if these patients were prescribed first-line antibiotics.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^111tWNDR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of skin abscesses, specifically concerning antibiotic therapy, the IDSA 2014 guidelines recommend administering antibiotics directed against S. aureus as an adjunct to incision and drainage in patients with systemic signs of infection such as:

- **Temperature**: Greater than 38 °C
- **Respiratory rate**: Greater than 24 breaths per minute
- **Heart rate (HR)**: Greater than 90 bpm
- **White blood cell (WBC) count**: Greater than 12,000 or less than 400 cells/mcL

### Hellenic consensus on infection [^11351ZsH]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

In patients with documented penicillin allergy, a clarithromycin, fluoroquinolone-containing regimen may represent an initial empirical approach. Culture and an antimicrobial susceptibility test, if available prior to any treatment attempt, could be an alternative option.

- **Recommendation grade**: C; Evidence level: 4; Agreement level: 85.7%.

H. pylori eradication is a challenge in patients allergic to penicillin. This results in suboptimal choices and an increased risk of treatment failure with regimens omitting amoxicillin. It may be speculated that the rate of resistance to antibiotics other than β-lactam, particularly macrolides such as clarithromycin, could be higher in such patients. Therefore, if the history is ambiguous, referral for allergy testing is appropriate before any initial therapeutic approach, as most patients can safely receive amoxicillin-containing regimens. There is a lack of data from clinical trials in Greece addressing H. pylori eradication in penicillin-allergic patients. If available, an antibiotic susceptibility test and culture could be the initial approach; if not, an empirical therapeutic step should be taken. The substitution of metronidazole for amoxicillin in a triple combination (PPI–clarithromycin–metronidazole) is not effective due to the prevalence of resistance to these antibiotics. As empirical first-line treatment, the combination of PPI–levofloxacin–clarithromycin for 10 days may be used.

### How to define and manage low-risk drug allergy labels [^112BrZov]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Low credibility.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole

Sulfonamide antibiotics are commonly prescribed for the immunocompromised population as prophylaxis and directed therapy for opportunistic pathogens, such as Pneumocystis jirovecii. Sulfonamide antibiotics are the second most frequently reported antibiotic allergy, with 3% to 8% of patients reporting a sulfonamide allergy. These antibiotics can cause immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reactions with varying severities. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) is also one of the most prevalent causes of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis and drug reaction eosinophilia and systemic syndrome.

Although there is limited evidence on the cross-reactivity between sulfonamide antibiotics, it has been demonstrated that sulfonamide antimicrobials and sulfonamide nonantimicrobials are unlikely to cross-react due to differences in chemical structure, with the exception of sulfasalazine — a prodrug composed of 5-aminosalicylic acid linked to the sulfa antibiotic sulfapyridine. Sulfonamide antibiotic hypersensitivity reactions target N1 (heterocyclic ring) or N4 (an aromatic amine), which are absent in sulfonamide nonantibiotics.

- **Risk stratification approach**: Historically, patients with sulfonamide allergy histories consistent with a potentially immediate or benign delayed hypersensitivity were managed with desensitization or induction of tolerance procedures. Although skin testing with the nonirritant concentration was possible, it rarely yielded positive tests, and the test characteristics were not robust.

### Gentamicin sulfate [^111NELmN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Gentamicin sulfate is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that provides highly effective topical treatment in primary and secondary bacterial infections of the skin. Gentamicin sulfate cream USP, 0.1% may clear infections that have not responded to other topical antibiotic agents. In primary skin infections such as impetigo contagiosa, treatment with gentamicin sulfate cream USP, 0.1% three or four times daily usually clears the lesions promptly. In secondary skin infections, gentamicin sulfate cream USP, 0.1% aids in treating the underlying dermatosis by controlling the infection.

Bacteria susceptible to the action of gentamicin sulfate include sensitive strains of Streptococci (group A beta-hemolytic, alpha-hemolytic), Staphylococcus aureus (coagulase positive, coagulase negative, and some penicillinase-producing strains), and the gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aerobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, and Klebsiella pneumoniae.

### Levofloxacin [^112QpbkD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Three hundred ninety-nine patients were enrolled in an open-label, randomized, comparative study for complicated skin and skin structure infections. The patients were randomized to receive either levofloxacin 750 mg once daily (IV followed by oral) or an approved comparator for a median of 10 ± 4.7 days. As is expected in complicated skin and skin structure infections, surgical procedures were performed in the levofloxacin and comparator groups. Surgery (incision and drainage or debridement) was performed on 45% of the levofloxacin-treated patients and 44% of the comparator-treated patients, either shortly before or during antibiotic treatment, forming an integral part of therapy for this indication.

Among those who could be evaluated clinically 2–5 days after completion of the study drug, overall success rates (improved or cured) were 116/138 (84.1%) for patients treated with levofloxacin and 106/132 (80.3%) for patients treated with the comparator.

Success rates varied with the type of diagnosis, ranging from 68% in patients with infected ulcers to 90% in patients with infected wounds and abscesses. These rates were equivalent to those seen with comparator drugs.

### Management of patients with a history of allergy to beta-lactam antibiotics [^117LPCsj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with a history of penicillin allergy pose a treatment dilemma. Unnecessary avoidance of this relatively nontoxic class of drugs exposes the patient to potentially more toxic drugs, increases healthcare costs, and contributes to the development of antibiotic resistance. Yet, for those who truly have an allergy or other serious adverse reactions to beta-lactams, the use of alternate drugs is a must. This article reviews management strategies to determine which patients are good candidates for reintroduction of beta-lactams and which patients should continue avoidance.

### Cefazolin as the mainstay for antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with a penicillin allergy in obstetrics and gynecology [^114FqJSb]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). High credibility.

Cefazolin is the most common antibiotic used for prophylaxis in obstetrics and gynecology. Among those with a penicillin allergy, alternative antibiotics are often chosen for prophylaxis, given fears of cross-reactivity between penicillin and cefazolin. Alternative antibiotics in this setting are associated with adverse sequelae, including surgical site infection, induction of bacterial resistance, higher costs to the healthcare system, and possible Clostridium difficile infection. Given the difference in R1 side chains between penicillin and cefazolin, cefazolin use is safe and should be recommended for patients with a penicillin allergy, including those who experience Immunoglobulin E-mediated reactions such as anaphylaxis.

Cefazolin should only be avoided in those who experience a history of a severe, life-threatening delayed hypersensitivity reaction manifested as severe cutaneous adverse reactions (Stevens-Johnson Syndrome), hepatitis, nephritis, serum sickness, and hemolytic anemia in response to penicillin administration. Additionally, over 90% of those with a documented penicillin allergy do not have true allergies on skin testing. Increased referral for penicillin allergy testing should be incorporated into routine obstetric care and preoperative assessment to reduce suboptimal antibiotic prophylaxis use. More education is needed among providers surrounding penicillin allergy assessment and cross-reactivity among penicillins and cephalosporins to optimize antibiotic prophylaxis in obstetrics and gynecology.

### "Treating through" decision and follow-up in antibiotic therapy-associated exanthemas [^112PTQQa]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Immediate discontinuation or replacement of suspected drugs is considered standard medical care in acute exanthematous skin reactions. However, in the treatment of bacterial infections, structurally different alternative antibiotics are commonly second-choice options due to suboptimal antimicrobial activity or an unfavorable side effect profile. Nonetheless, "treating through", the continuation of antibiotic treatment despite an objective exanthema, is practiced only rarely.

- **Objective**: We aimed to assess whether "treating through" is an option for patients with severe bacterial soft tissue infections (severe cellulitis) who experience maculopapular exanthema (MPE) during antibiotic therapy.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed clinical data from 18 patients who developed MPE within a few days after the initiation of intravenous antibiotic treatment. A decision to "treat through" was made when the suspected antibiotics (β-lactams, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin) were clinically effective and the benefits of continued treatment outweighed potential risks. Clinical and laboratory findings were closely monitored in an inpatient setting.

- **Results**: In 2 patients, a modification of antibiotic therapy was deemed necessary due to a significant increase in liver enzymes within 4 days after the initial decision to "treat through". Because of the progression of MPE under ongoing treatment with cefuroxime and clindamycin, clindamycin was discontinued in 1 patient. In another 3 patients, antibiotic treatment was modified due to insufficient improvement of the soft tissue infection.

### Sulfonamide hypersensitivity: Fact and fiction [^1125NNMY]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Low credibility.

Sulfonamide antimicrobials are commonly reported to cause drug allergies and have been implicated in a variety of hypersensitivity reactions, including immediate IgE-mediated reactions, benign T-cell-mediated rashes, and severe cutaneous adverse reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms. Cross-reactivity is unlikely between sulfonamide antimicrobials and sulfonamide non-antimicrobials. In patients who develop reactions to a sulfonamide non-antimicrobial, there is no evidence to suggest that sulfonamide antimicrobials and other sulfonamide non-antimicrobials would cross-react.

Although immediate skin testing can be performed in patients with histories of immediate reactions, they are infrequently positive and wane over time. Delayed skin testing, including patch tests to sulfonamides, is rarely positive. Drug challenges are a useful tool for patients with both immediate and delayed reactions to sulfonamides. The role of sulfamethoxazole desensitization is controversial, as rates of hypersensitivity reactions are similar between desensitization and drug challenge.

### Cutaneous adverse reactions to clindamycin: Results of skin tests and oral exposure [^114uqZAQ]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Clindamycin is an antibiotic used in anaerobic and severe complicated infections. It is often selected for patients with a history of allergy to other antibiotics.

- **Objectives**: To study the occurrence of clindamycin hypersensitivity and to determine whether skin tests are useful in cases of suspected clindamycin allergy.

- **Methods**: Six patients with an exanthematous rash and a history strongly suggestive of clindamycin hypersensitivity were studied with skin tests and oral exposure. Cases of suspected adverse drug reactions to clindamycin reported to the National Register of Adverse Effects of Drugs (NRAED) in Finland during 1973–2000 were analysed.

- **Results**: In the skin tests, true-positive patch test reactions were seen in four of six patients, while 22 healthy control patients were negative. One false-positive and one false-negative patch test reaction were seen. During 1973–2000, 29 suspected cases of skin and/or mucosal membranes affected by clindamycin were reported to the NRAED.

- **Conclusions**: Clindamycin hypersensitivity is not common. Delayed-type allergic reactions occur, and patch tests are useful in those cases. Oral exposure is the method of choice if possible, as false-negative and false-positive reactions may occur.

### Practical management of antibiotic allergy in adults [^116FeznF]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

This review examines the primary issues surrounding immediate hypersensitivity and the role and limitations of testing. The majority of literature on antibiotic hypersensitivity pertains to β-lactam antibiotics, mainly due to the extensive use of this drug class. Concerns about cross-reactivity often worry clinicians, particularly during emergencies. There is reasonable data now available regarding β-lactam antibiotics and their derivatives, which allows for appropriate risk management. The existing literature for other classes of antibiotics is also discussed.

### Emerging treatment options for skin and soft tissue infections tailoring drug selection to individual patients [^114S9jGm]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

To provide a brief overview of drugs in Phase II and III of development for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) is essential in offering insights into potential customized treatment options.

- **Recent findings**: Several drugs are currently in advanced stages of evaluation for the treatment of ABSSSI, and numerous molecules are entering the early development phases. Notably, many of these drugs exhibit unique mechanisms of action and interesting antimicrobial spectra.

- **Summary**: Tailoring antibiotic therapy based on patient characteristics, likely pathogens, and the type, site, and severity of ABSSSI is crucial. Given the inherent limitations of available treatments, the development of novel agents is a pivotal avenue. Such advancements hold promise for enhancing treatment efficacy and simplifying drug selection for ABSSSI in everyday clinical practice.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus vancomycin for severe infections caused by meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus: randomised controlled trial [^11471bHB]. BMJ (2015). High credibility.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is an old antibiotic active against Staphylococcus aureus. Trimethoprim is the main active component and is bactericidal in itself, but the combination is highly synergistic. With increasing rates of meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in healthcare settings and in the community, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been suggested as a convenient treatment option.

MRSA isolates have retained susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in many locations worldwide despite several decades of exposure to the antibiotic. Coverage rates above 90% are described in contemporary reports for community-associated MRSA and nosocomial isolates in the United States, Canada, Japan, Europe, Israel, and Turkey. Resistance is described in Australia, where 30% of nosocomial and 10% of community-associated MRSA isolates were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in 2012, but a significant trend for decreasing resistance from 2005 was observed, unlike other antibiotics. In sub-Saharan Africa, 19% resistance has been recently documented, owing to high rates of trimethoprim resistance. In India, more than 85% of MRSA isolates were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole between 2009 and 2011.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections but not for MRSA bacteraemia or pneumonia. Vancomycin is the primary treatment recommendation for these infections. Alternatives to vancomycin are sought as vancomycin is inferior to β-lactams in meticillin susceptible S. aureus.

### Practical management of antibiotic hypersensitivity in 2017 [^116KQxdK]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Antibiotics are the most common class of medications to which individuals report allergy or intolerance. Adverse reactions occur at a predictable rate with all antibiotic use, varying by antibiotic. The incidence rates of antibiotic allergies are sex-dependent, being higher in females than in males. Most of these events are neither reproducible nor immunologically mediated. The prevalence of antibiotic allergies increases with age and is more common in hospitalized populations and those using more antibiotics. Determining potential mechanisms for observed symptoms of adverse reactions is the starting point for effective management of antibiotic hypersensitivity.

Skin testing and direct challenges are the primary tools used to determine acute tolerance in 2017. Commercially available in vitro testing is not currently clinically useful for determining antibiotic hypersensitivity, with rare exceptions. Desensitization can be employed when acute-onset immunologically mediated hypersensitivity is confirmed, to safely administer a needed antibiotic. However, desensitization is not possible when clinically significant T-cell-mediated delayed-type hypersensitivity is present. Effective management of antibiotic allergy is a vital component of a comprehensive antibiotic stewardship program.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113KrirW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of skin abscesses, particularly concerning antibiotic therapy, the IDSA 2014 guidelines recommend administering an antibiotic active against MRSA in patients with carbuncles or abscesses that do not respond to initial antibiotic treatment. This recommendation also applies to patients with markedly impaired host defenses or those experiencing systemic inflammatory response syndrome associated with hypotension.

---

### Nafcillin [^1125QnEF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2011). Low credibility.

Nafcillin should generally not be administered to patients with a history of sensitivity to any penicillin. Penicillin should be used with caution in individuals with histories of significant allergies and/or asthma. Whenever allergic reactions occur, penicillin should be withdrawn unless, in the opinion of the physician, the condition being treated is life-threatening and amenable only to penicillin therapy. The use of antibiotics may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms; if new infections due to bacteria or fungi occur, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate measures taken.

The liver/biliary tract is the primary route of nafcillin clearance. Caution should be exercised when patients with concomitant hepatic insufficiency and renal dysfunction are treated with nafcillin. Serum levels should be measured, and the dosage adjusted appropriately to avoid possible neurotoxic reactions associated with very high concentrations [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION].

Prescribing Nafcillin for Injection, USP in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Nafcillin for Injection, USP should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g. the common cold).

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112cLfcS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). High credibility.

A panel of national experts was convened by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) to update the 2005 guidelines for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). The panel's recommendations were developed to be concordant with the recently published IDSA guidelines for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. The focus of this guideline is the diagnosis and appropriate treatment of diverse SSTIs, ranging from minor superficial infections to life-threatening infections, such as necrotizing fasciitis. In addition, because of an increasing number of immunocompromised hosts worldwide, the guideline addresses the wide array of SSTIs that occur in this population. These guidelines emphasize the importance of clinical skills in promptly diagnosing SSTIs, identifying the pathogen, and administering effective treatments in a timely fashion.

### Sulfatrim [^112uUetQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Prescribing sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection, or a prophylactic indication, is unlikely to benefit the patient and increases the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria.

- **Caution in patient populations**: Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension should be administered with caution to patients with impaired renal or hepatic function, those with possible folate deficiency (e.g. the elderly, chronic alcoholics, patients receiving anticonvulsant therapy, patients with malabsorption syndrome, and patients in malnutrition states), and those with severe allergies or bronchial asthma. In individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, hemolysis may occur, a reaction that is frequently dose-related.

- **Use in the elderly**: Cases of hypoglycemia in non-diabetic patients treated with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are rare, typically occurring following a few days of therapy. Patients with renal dysfunction, liver disease, malnutrition, or those receiving high doses of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are particularly at risk. Hematological changes indicative of folic acid deficiency may occur in elderly patients or in those with preexisting folic acid deficiency or kidney failure; these effects are reversible with folinic acid therapy.

Trimethoprim has been observed to impair phenylalanine metabolism; however, this is not significant for phenylketonuric patients on appropriate dietary restriction. As with all drugs containing sulfonamides, caution is advised.

### Direct challenges are the gold standard for most antibiotic allergy evaluations [^113WNYMj]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). High credibility.

Antibiotic allergies are frequently encountered in clinical practice, and delabeling of these allergies has individual and public health benefits. This review focuses on the evidence supporting graded challenges without preceding skin testing in adult and pediatric patients for the major groups of antibiotics, including penicillins, cephalosporins, sulfamethoxazole, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, macrolides, metronidazole, carbapenems, and aztreonam. The cost savings, time savings, and evidence for performing graded challenges outside of an allergy/immunology office are also reviewed for graded challenges to penicillins.

### A prospective observational study of the effect of penicillin skin testing on antibiotic use in the intensive care unit [^117VMmv1]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2003). Low credibility.

Patients with penicillin allergy admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) frequently receive non-beta-lactam antimicrobials for the treatment of infection. The use of these antimicrobials, more commonly vancomycin and fluoroquinolones, is associated with the emergence of multidrug-resistant infections. The penicillin skin test (PST) can help detect patients at risk of developing an immediate allergic reaction to penicillin, and those patients with a negative PST may be able to use a penicillin antibiotic safely.

- **Methods**: We determined the incidence of true penicillin allergy, the percentage of patients changed to a beta-lactam antimicrobial when the test was negative, the safety of the test, and the safety of administration of beta-lactam antimicrobials in patients with a negative test. Skin testing was performed using standard methodology.

- **Results**: One hundred patients admitted to four ICUs were prospectively studied; 58 of them were male. The mean age was 63 years. Ninety-six patients had the PST: one was positive (1.04%), 10 (10.4%) were nondiagnostic, and 85 (88.5%) were negative. Of the 38 patients who received antimicrobials for therapeutic reasons, 31 (81.5%) had the antibiotic changed to a beta-lactam antimicrobial following a negative reading versus 7 patients of the 57 (12%) who had received a prophylactic antimicrobial (P < .001). No adverse effects were reported after the PST or after antimicrobial administration.

- **Conclusions**: The PST is a safe, reliable, and effective strategy to reduce the use of non-beta-lactam antimicrobials in patients who are labeled.

### Current treatment options for acute skin and skin-structure infections [^112SXE2M]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections (ABSSSIs) are a common reason for seeking care at acute healthcare facilities, including emergency departments. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common organism associated with these infections, and the emergence of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has represented a considerable challenge in their treatment. To address this need, a number of new antibiotics have been developed for the treatment of ABSSSIs in the past several years. Most of these agents focus primarily on gram-positive organisms, particularly MRSA; however, there has not been an oral agent that can reliably treat MRSA, as well as relevant gram-negative pathogens. Acute skin infections that involve mixed gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens must also be considered as they can be associated with discordant antimicrobial therapy. In this review, ABSSSI treatment guidelines in the hospital setting are discussed, along with future antibiotic options for the treatment of this commonly encountered infection.

### Improving clinical outcomes in patients with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and reported penicillin allergy [^116Y7XbV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia is a morbid infection. First-line MSSA therapies (nafcillin, oxacillin, cefazolin) are generally avoided in the 10% of patients reporting penicillin (PCN) allergy, but most of these patients are not truly allergic. We used a decision tree with sensitivity analyses to determine the optimal evaluation and treatment for patients with MSSA bacteremia and reported PCN allergy.

- **Methods**: Our model simulates three strategies: (1) no allergy evaluation, give vancomycin (Vanc); (2) allergy history-guided treatment — if history excludes anaphylactic features, give cefazolin (Hx-Cefaz); and (3) complete allergy evaluation with history-appropriate PCN skin testing — if skin test negative, give cefazolin (ST-Cefaz). Model outcomes included a 12-week MSSA cure, recurrence, and death; allergic reactions, including major, minor, and potentially iatrogenic; and adverse drug reactions.

- **Results**: Vanc results in the fewest patients achieving MSSA cure and the highest rate of recurrence (67.3%/14.8% vs. 83.4%/9.3% for Hx-Cefaz and 84.5%/8.9% for ST-Cefaz), as well as the greatest frequency of allergic reactions (3.0% vs. 2.4% for Hx-Cefaz and 1.7% for ST-Cefaz) and highest rates of adverse drug reactions (5.2% vs. 4.6% for Hx-Cefaz and 4.7% for ST-Cefaz). Even in a "best case for Vanc" scenario, Vanc yields the poorest outcomes. ST-Cefaz is preferred to Hx-Cefaz although sensitive to input variations.

- **Conclusions**: Patients with MSSA bacteremia and a reported PCN allergy should have the allergy addressed for optimal treatment.

### Current treatment options for acute skin and skin-structure infections [^1125JJvB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Most recently, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) published practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of ABSSSIs. This publication predates the FDA approval of several newer antibiotics for the treatment of ABSSSIs, including dalbavancin, oritavancin, tedizolid, and delafloxacin.

The guidelines divide ABSSSIs into purulent and nonpurulent categories. Cellulitis and erysipelas are considered nonpurulent, while abscesses are categorized as purulent.

- **Severe purulent infections**: Vancomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, daptomycin, ceftaroline, and telavancin are all considered appropriate antimicrobial agents.
- **Moderate purulent infections**: Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and doxycycline are recommended.
- **Methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA)**: For severe infections, cefazolin and clindamycin are recommended. For moderate infections, dicloxacillin and cephalexin are advised.

Vancomycin plus piperacillin/tazobactam is recommended as a first-line treatment option for severe nonpurulent infections, particularly suspected necrotizing or polymicrobial infections. However, this combination has been associated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury compared with vancomycin with or without other beta-lactams.

Options for the treatment of mild to moderate nonpurulent infections include cefazolin, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, and penicillin. Although there is a lack of data to support the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy, the guidelines recommend a treatment duration of 7–10 days.

A randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial conducted in the US compared the efficacy of Avelox 400 mg once daily for seven days with cephalexin HCl 500 mg three times daily for seven days. The percentage of patients treated for uncomplicated abscesses was 30%, furuncles 8%, cellulitis 16%, impetigo 20%, and other skin infections 26%. Adjunctive procedures, such as incision and drainage or debridement, were performed on 17% of the Avelox-treated patients and 14% of the comparator-treated patients. Clinical success rates in evaluable patients were 89% (108/122) for Avelox and 91% (110/121) for cephalexin HCl.

- **Complicated skin and skin structure infections**: Two randomized, active-controlled trials of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) were conducted. A double-blind trial was conducted primarily in North America to compare the efficacy of sequential IV/PO Avelox 400 mg once daily for 7–14 days to an IV/PO beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor control in patients with cSSSI. This study enrolled 617 patients, 335 of whom were valid for efficacy analysis. A second open-label international study compared Avelox 400 mg once daily for 7–21 days to sequential IV/PO beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor control in patients with cSSSI. This study enrolled 804 patients, 632 of whom were valid for efficacy analysis. Surgical incision and drainage or debridement was performed on 55% of the Avelox-treated and 53% of the comparator-treated patients, forming an integral part of therapy for this indication.

### Infections in patients with atopic dermatitis and the influence of treatment [^114LqiK7]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Effective management of skin infections involves identifying and treating the underlying microbiologic agent and implementing infection prevention measures. If left untreated, skin infections can become systemic and lead to life-threatening complications.

Topical and systemic antibiotics may be necessary to treat bacterial infections. However, antibiotics should only be used in clinically affected atopic dermatitis (AD), as indiscriminate use increases the risk of developing antibiotic-resistant strains, which poses a therapeutic challenge. The choice of treatment depends on local patterns of antibacterial resistance, particularly the prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Culture of the causative pathogen is recommended to guide therapy, but empiric therapy is reasonable in uncomplicated cases or before culture results become available.

Table 2 illustrates the guideline-recommended antibacterial options for empiric treatment of skin infections and their indications. Topical antibacterial agents can be used for the treatment of localized skin infections and decolonization. For uncomplicated, non-purulent skin infections, preferred empiric antibacterial treatments are usually oral β-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin or cephalosporin. In patients with AD and a skin abscess, oral antibiotics such as clindamycin, doxycycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or linezolid can be considered. Infections occurring in countries or regions with a high prevalence of MRSA require treatment with agents that are active against MRSA (e.g. trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole).

### Antibiotic hypersensitivity reactions and approaches to desensitization [^116LBeSN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Before initiating antibiotic therapy, drug hypersensitivity is an important consideration. A common strategy is to avoid giving patients medications when there is a high likelihood of severe reactions. With an increase in antibiotic resistance and a decrease in novel antibiotics, there is greater pressure to consider antibiotics in patients with a history of adverse reactions.

The major concerns include IgE-mediated (type I) reactions, anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Some antibiotics with similar characteristics, such as cephalosporins and penicillins, may be given safely to patients with a certain allergy profile. However, there is still greater concern when considering antibiotics for patients with reported allergies. Desensitization is a strategy to safely induce drug tolerance to a specific drug to limit the possibility of a type I reaction.

### Drug allergy in older adults: A study from the United States Drug Allergy Registry [^115AvEjM]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). High credibility.

Older adults have an increased risk of adverse drug reactions and negative effects associated with alternative antibiotic use. Although the number of antibiotic allergies reported increases with age, the characteristics and outcomes of older adults receiving drug allergy assessment are unknown.

- **Objective**: To assess the characteristics and outcomes of drug allergy evaluations in older adults.

- **Methods**: We considered patients aged 65 and above enrolled in the United States Drug Allergy Registry (USDAR), a US multisite prospective cohort (January 16, 2019, to February 28, 2022). Data were summarized using descriptive statistics.

- **Results**: Of 1,678 USDAR participants from five sites, 406 older adults aged 65 and above (37% aged 65–69 years, 37% aged 70–74 years, 16% aged 75–79 years, and 10% aged 80 years and above) received 501 drug allergy assessments. USDAR older adults were primarily female (69%), White (94%), and non-Hispanic (98%). Most reported one or less infections per year (64%) and rated their general health as good, very good, or excellent (80%). Of 296 penicillin allergy assessments in USDAR older adults, 286 (97%) were disproved. Other drug allergy assessments included sulfonamide (n = 41, 88% disproved) and cephalosporin (n = 20, 95% disproved) antibiotics. All 41 drug allergy labels in USDAR participants aged 80 and above and all 80 penicillin allergy labels in USDAR men aged 65 and above were disproved.

### Topical antibacterial agents in dermatology [^11393eSw]. The Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Topical antibacterials are widely used for the treatment or prevention of superficial bacterial infections. The emergence of drug-resistant mutant strains of microorganisms, as well as the development of irritant and allergic contact dermatitis, are common problems associated with many topical antibacterials. This review focuses on the spectrum of activity, resistance patterns, contact sensitivity potential, and clinical uses of topical antibacterials. Factors that aid physicians in choosing a specific antibacterial for a particular indication, with the aim of maximizing efficacy and minimizing adverse effects, are discussed.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116BbNeu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). High credibility.

A panel of national experts was convened by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) to update the 2005 guidelines for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). The panel's recommendations were developed to be concordant with the recently published IDSA guidelines for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. The focus of this guideline is the diagnosis and appropriate treatment of diverse SSTIs, ranging from minor superficial infections to life-threatening infections such as necrotizing fasciitis. Additionally, due to an increasing number of immunocompromised hosts worldwide, the guideline addresses the wide array of SSTIs that occur in this population. These guidelines emphasize the importance of clinical skills in promptly diagnosing SSTIs, identifying the pathogen, and administering effective treatments in a timely fashion.

### Practical aspects of choosing an antibiotic for patients with a reported allergy to an antibiotic [^116zLC6d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Physicians often must select antibiotics for patients who are reported to have an antibiotic allergy.

- **Sensitivity of penicillin skin testing**: For penicillins, it is excellent for predicting serious allergic reactions.

- **Usefulness for other beta-lactam antibiotics**: Penicillin skin testing is useful for excluding the possibility of sensitivity to the beta-lactam ring.

- **Patient history for other antibiotics**: The patient history remains the most useful tool for determining whether a serious reaction is likely to occur with further drug exposure.

- **Cross-reactivity between penicillins and other antibiotics**: The cross-reactivity between penicillins and second- or third-generation cephalosporins (excluding cefamandole) is probably no higher than the cross-reactivity between penicillins and other classes of antibiotics.

- **Consideration of desensitization therapy**: When a patient has a suspected immunoglobulin E-mediated antibiotic allergy, desensitization therapy should be considered if the efficacy of alternate antibiotics is in doubt.

- **Administration of antibiotics for serious infections**: For the treatment of serious infections, it is usually possible to safely administer the antibiotic of choice despite a history of possible antibiotic allergy.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or clindamycin for community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) skin infections [^116HeCRE]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

In the United States, community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) has emerged as the predominant cause of skin infections. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and clindamycin are often used as first-line treatment options, but clinical data are lacking.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of outpatients with skin and soft tissue infections managed from July 1 to December 31, 2006. Patients younger than 18 years of age were excluded, as were those who had no clinical admission or progress notes, were hospitalized within the 90 days before admission, were hospitalized with polymicrobial, surgical site, catheter-related, or diabetic foot infections, or were discharged to places other than home. Patient demographics, comorbidities, diagnoses, cultures, prescribed antibiotics, susceptibilities, surgical procedures, and health outcomes were extracted from electronic medical records. Patients were divided into two cohorts for further analysis: TMP-SMX and clindamycin. The primary study outcome was composite failure, defined as an additional positive MRSA culture from any site 5 to 90 days after treatment initiation or an additional intervention during a subsequent outpatient or inpatient visit. Baseline characteristics and failure rates were compared using χ², Fisher's exact, and Wilcoxon rank sum tests.

- **Results**: A total of 149 patients were included in this study. These patients had a median age of 36 years, 55% were men, 71% were Hispanic, 42% were uninsured, and 60% received an incision and drainage procedure.

### Absence of cross-reactivity between sulfonamide antibiotics and sulfonamide nonantibiotics [^117W356d]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The safety of sulfonamide nonantibiotics is unclear in patients with prior allergic reactions to sulfonamide antibiotics.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the General Practice Research Database in the United Kingdom, examining the risk of allergic reactions within 30 days after the receipt of a sulfonamide nonantibiotic. Patients with evidence of prior hypersensitivity after receiving a sulfonamide antibiotic were compared with those without such evidence. Similar analyses were also performed using penicillins instead of sulfonamides, to determine whether any risk was specific to sulfonamide cross-reactivity.

- **Results**: Of 969 patients with an allergic reaction following a sulfonamide antibiotic, 96 (9.9 percent) had an allergic reaction after subsequently receiving a sulfonamide nonantibiotic. Of 19,257 who had no allergic reaction following a sulfonamide antibiotic, 315 (1.6 percent) had an allergic reaction after receiving a sulfonamide nonantibiotic (adjusted odds ratio, 2.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.1 to 3.7). However, the risk of allergic reactions was even greater after receiving a penicillin among patients with a prior hypersensitivity reaction to a sulfonamide antibiotic, compared with patients with no such history (adjusted odds ratio, 3.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 3.5 to 4.3).

### Are cephalosporins safe for surgical prophylaxis in patients with penicillin allergy [^115sPQXG]. The Laryngoscope (2024). Low credibility.

Cefazolin, also known as Ancef, is a first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic often used in surgery to treat or prevent bacterial infection of the surgical site. Ancef is safe for most of the population; however, many physicians use alternative, less effective medications in patients with penicillin allergy due to a fear of cross-reactivity between Ancef and a penicillin allergy. In this article, we aim to examine if cefazolin is safe for patients with penicillin allergy.

### Improving cefazolin administration for surgical prophylaxis in reported penicillin allergy: A retrospective study of a health system intervention [^113o9UXs]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2025). High credibility.

Reported penicillin allergies affect 10% to 15% of patients and pose a threat to the appropriate administration of first-line surgical-site infection (SSI) antimicrobial prophylaxis. The scope of this impact is significant: SSIs are the most common and costly health care–associated infections, affecting 2% to 5% of surgeries in the United States. The aims of administering first-line surgical antibiotic prophylaxis are to prevent SSI, lower the risk of multidrug-resistant organisms, and reduce morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. Cefazolin is the medication of choice for most procedures because of its desirable spectrum of activity, favorable safety profile, and low cost. The presence of a penicillin allergy label alone is associated with a 50% increased risk of SSI, likely mediated by the reduction in the use of first-line antibiotics, most often cefazolin.

When alternative antibiotics are used for surgical prophylaxis, there are demonstrably higher rates of SSIs, prosthetic joint infections, surgical revisions, and multidrug-resistant infections across a broad range of surgical specialties and procedures.

Although reported penicillin allergies commonly affect prescribing decisions, there is good evidence that most are inaccurate: more than 95% of these patients can tolerate penicillin safely, and even more can tolerate cephalosporins. Patients are often inaccurately labeled because either a patient was mislabeled at the time of the inciting event or because, in cases of true allergy, most cases will be outgrown within 10 years.

### Sulfatrim [^113Jerfy]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized procedure. Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method (broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim powder. The MIC values should be interpreted according to the following criteria:

- **For testing Enterobacteriaceae**:

- **When testing either Haemophilus influenzae or Streptococcus pneumoniae**: A report of "Susceptible" indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable. A report of "Intermediate" indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where a high dosage of the drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone which prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of "Resistant" indicates that the pathogen is not likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable; other therapy should be selected.

### WSES/GAIS/WSIS/SIS-E/AAST global clinical pathways for patients with skin and soft tissue infections [^112TNn17]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

In patients with beta-lactam allergy, ciprofloxacin 500 mg every 12 hours combined with metronidazole 500 mg every 8 hours is recommended. First-generation cephalosporins, such as cephalexin, penicillinase-resistant penicillins, macrolides such as erythromycin, and clindamycin, all have poor in vitro activity against Pasteurella multocida and should be avoided in cases of animal bites.

- **In patients at risk for CA-MRSA or those who do not respond to first-line therapy, add**:
	- **One of the following oral antibiotics**:
		- Minocycline 100 mg every 12 hours
		- Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole 160/800–320/1600 mg every 12 hours
		- Doxycycline 100 mg every 12 hours

- **Inpatient therapy**:
	- **One of the following intravenous antibiotics**:
		- Ceftriaxone 2 g every 24 hours combined with metronidazole 500 mg every 8 hours
		- Cefotaxime 2 g every 8 hours combined with metronidazole 500 mg every 8 hours
		- Piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 g every 6 hours

In patients with beta-lactam allergy, alternative therapy options include ciprofloxacin 200 mg every 8 hours combined with metronidazole 500 mg every 8 hours. For patients at risk for CA-MRSA or those who do not respond to first-line therapy, options include a vancomycin 25–30 mg/kg loading dose followed by 15–20 mg/kg/dose every 12 hours or linezolid 600 mg every 12 hours.

Prophylactic trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) prevents Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and nocardiosis in immunocompromised patients but is sometimes avoided because of purported allergies or side effects. Among 25 immunocompromised patients receiving alternative prophylaxis, nocardiosis developed in 16 individuals who subsequently tolerated TMP/SMX treatment. Clinicians should consider TMP/SMX allergy evaluation and rechallenging to assess patient tolerance.

### Tobramycin [^114KJSEh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Warnings**: This product contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions, including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes, in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is more frequently seen in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic people.

- **Serious allergic reactions**: Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and dermatologic reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have been reported rarely in patients on tobramycin therapy. Although rare, fatalities have been reported. If an allergic reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued, and appropriate therapy instituted (see contraindications).

- **Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD)**: CDAD has been reported with the use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including tobramycin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon, leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B, which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. A careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over various timeframes following antibiotic administration.

### Allergies to sulfonamide antibiotics and sulfur-containing drugs [^113i3tBH]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

To provide a literature review and clinical summary of the evaluation and management of sulfonamide drug reactions, data was sourced from published English-language medical literature. Selected trials of drug desensitization protocols were included.

Obtaining a detailed history is invaluable in assessing a history of reactions to sulfonamide medications, as allergy to these drugs remains a clinical diagnosis at present. Numerous efficacious drug desensitization protocols for management have been published and are reviewed in detail.

The term sulfa allergy is imprecise and misleading and therefore should be discouraged. There are important distinctions between sulfonylarylamines (antimicrobial sulfonamides), nonarylamine (nonantimicrobial) sulfonamides, and sulfones, with regard to allergic and other adverse drug reactions. Most reactions to sulfonylarylamines probably result from multifactorial immunologic and toxic metabolic mechanisms, whereas less is known about the precise mechanisms of reactions to other sulfur-containing drugs.

### Does the penicillin allergy label affect outcomes of complicated odontogenic infections [^1173sNtH]? Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Penicillins are a potent antibiotic in managing odontogenic infections, but 10% of the population is labeled as allergic to these drugs. This has limited their use and resulted in increased utilization of healthcare resources and complications associated with alternative antibiotics. The purpose of the study was to measure the association between patients labeled as penicillin allergic and treatment outcomes in a sample of patients treated for complicated odontogenic infections. Additionally, the study sought to investigate antibiotic resistance patterns in these patients.

A retrospective cohort study was performed at the Michigan Medicine healthcare system, including patients treated for complicated odontogenic infections by oral and maxillofacial surgery between 2016 and 2020. A complicated odontogenic infection was defined as any odontogenic infection requiring admission and surgical management in the operating room. The primary predictor variable was the penicillin allergy label, determined by chart review and not confirmed with formal testing.

- **Primary outcome variables**: Hospital length of stay.
- **Secondary outcome variables**: ICU admission (yes/no), repeat computed tomography scan(s), repeat surgery (yes/no), and re-admission (yes/no).
- **Co-variates included**: Age, sex (male/female), tobacco use status, diabetes, immunocompromised state, number of spaces involved, white blood cell count upon admission, and insurance status.

### Moxifloxacin hydrochloride [^1162smbQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections**: A randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial conducted in the US compared the efficacy of moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily for seven days with cephalexin HCl 500 mg three times daily for seven days. The percentage of patients treated for uncomplicated abscesses was 30%, furuncles 8%, cellulitis 16%, impetigo 20%, and other skin infections 26%. Adjunctive procedures, such as incision and drainage or debridement, were performed on 17% of the moxifloxacin-treated patients and 14% of the comparator-treated patients. Clinical success rates in evaluable patients were 89% (108/122) for moxifloxacin and 91% (110/121) for cephalexin HCl.

- **Complicated skin and skin structure infections**: Two randomized, active-controlled trials of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) were performed. A double-blind trial was conducted primarily in North America to compare the efficacy of sequential intravenous/oral moxifloxacin 400 mg once a day for 7 to 14 days to an intravenous/oral beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor control in the treatment of patients with cSSSI. This study enrolled 617 patients, 335 of whom were valid for the efficacy analysis. A second open-label international study compared moxifloxacin 400 mg once a day for 7 to 21 days to sequential intravenous/oral beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor control in the treatment of patients with cSSSI. This study enrolled 804 patients, 632 of whom were valid for the efficacy analysis. Surgical incision and drainage or debridement was performed on 55% of the moxifloxacin-treated patients and 53% of the comparator-treated patients.
