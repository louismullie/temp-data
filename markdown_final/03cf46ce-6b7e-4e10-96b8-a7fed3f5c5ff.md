## Question

What are the most common underlying causes of erythema nodosum?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most common underlying causes of erythema nodosum. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline epidemiology and how often EN is idiopathic. Then, I should verify the major etiologic categories and rank them by frequency across settings. Next, I will examine age- and geography-specific differences, including pediatric versus adult patterns and endemic mycoses. After that, I should review emerging triggers such as COVID-19 and newer medications. Finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic hierarchy of causes and outline a focused diagnostic approach, making sure I double-check any conflicting data before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the baseline epidemiology and the idiopathic fraction, because that frames how often we will find a cause. EN is the most common panniculitis, typically presents with tender erythematous pretibial nodules, and in many series a substantial proportion remains idiopathic, often cited around 30–50%, though some cohorts report lower idiopathic rates when evaluation is more intensive, so I should be cautious not to overstate "idiopathic" without context [^114SFc7U] [^112ezHfy] [^112PiVyi] [^116C7LDB].

> Now, I will categorize the major etiologic groups so I don't miss anything: infections, inflammatory/autoimmune diseases, drugs, pregnancy, and malignancy; I should also keep in mind that EN is a hypersensitivity reaction pattern rather than a single disease, which explains the breadth of triggers and the need to tailor workup to pretest probabilities [^114SFc7U] [^112ezHfy].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about which infection is most common everywhere; I need to check regional and age-specific patterns. In many high-income settings, streptococcal pharyngitis is the leading identifiable infection, whereas in endemic regions primary tuberculosis is prominent; in children, gastroenteritis due to Yersinia, Salmonella, or Campylobacter is common, and fungal diseases such as coccidioidomycosis and histoplasmosis cluster geographically and seasonally, so travel and exposure history are critical [^114SFc7U] [^112ezHfy] [^113Vjjj8] [^1139DLRY] [^116ymwjZ].

> Wait, let me verify the mycobacterial piece because it's easy to overgeneralize. Primary tuberculosis is a classic cause of EN in developing countries and remains important where TB prevalence is high, whereas in low-TB-incidence regions like Finland, TB-associated EN is rare; I should also remember that EN is a recognized hypersensitivity manifestation of TB in children and can be the presenting sign of primary infection, so chest radiography and IGRA are prudent when risk is plausible [^1119rQXk] [^112chXRC] [^115FQfdV].

> Next, I should review inflammatory and autoimmune associations, and I need to ensure I separate association from causality. Sarcoidosis is a leading cause in adults and is tightly linked to Löfgren's syndrome, which often has an excellent prognosis; IBD is frequently cited as the most common cutaneous EIM in IBD cohorts, with EN occurring in roughly 3–10% of UC and 4–15% of CD, and Mendelian randomization suggests a causal relationship for CD but not UC, so I should be precise when stating causality; Behçet disease is a notable vasculitic cause and should be considered with oral/genital ulcers and ocular or neurologic involvement [^114SFc7U] [^113UMPQu] [^114RJYZp] [^115FTjLU].

> I will now examine drug-induced EN, and I should double-check that I'm not conflating frequency with notoriety. Classic culprits include oral contraceptives, sulfonamides, and antibiotics, and newer reports implicate GLP-1 receptor agonists like semaglutide, IL-17/IL-4/IL-13 pathway inhibitors, and immune checkpoint inhibitors; vaccine-associated EN has been described with COVID-19 vaccines and historically with other vaccines, so a meticulous medication and vaccination timeline is essential [^114RJYZp] [^111atPhF] [^111KTAt3] [^115xKBLP] [^116v5Ts2].

> But wait, what about pregnancy and hormonal states; I should confirm the directionality. EN is well recognized in pregnancy and with exogenous estrogen exposure, and female predominance in EN likely reflects both hormonal susceptibility and higher exposure to estrogen-containing therapies; this is consistent with epidemiologic series showing female predominance and pregnancy-related cases [^114SFc7U] [^113mmUWG] [^112PiVyi].

> Let me consider malignancy, and I should verify that I'm not overstating its frequency. Lymphomas, particularly Hodgkin lymphoma, have a recognized association with EN, and solid organ malignancies are occasionally reported; in practice, malignancy accounts for a small minority of EN cases, but unexplained or recurrent EN warrants age-appropriate cancer screening and clinical vigilance [^114SFc7U] [^115wr1NG] [^1112Ywfw].

> Next, I should review emerging and notable triggers so I don't miss contemporary causes. COVID-19 infection and vaccination have both been temporally associated with EN in case series and reports, supporting inclusion of SARS-CoV-2 in the differential when timing fits; immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome in HIV can present with EN-like inflammatory skin lesions, reminding me to integrate HIV and opportunistic infection contexts into the workup when relevant [^115jM6Np] [^111CQfCx] [^1116rfu5].

> I need to ensure I address age-specific patterns because pediatric and adult etiologies diverge. In children, streptococcal infection remains common, but enteric infections such as Yersinia, Salmonella, and Campylobacter are frequently implicated, and IBD may present with EN even before intestinal symptoms; in adults, sarcoidosis, streptococcal infection, TB in endemic settings, drugs, and pregnancy predominate, so pretest probabilities should be adjusted by age and geography [^113Vjjj8] [^115dKREH] [^114SFc7U] [^113UMPQu].

> Let me synthesize a hierarchy, but I should double-check that I'm aligning with the best available cohort data. Across contemporary cohorts, the most common identifiable causes are streptococcal infection, sarcoidosis, IBD, primary tuberculosis in endemic regions, drugs (notably oral contraceptives and antibiotics), and pregnancy; however, a large US cohort suggests that only about 25% of cases remain idiopathic when evaluation is comprehensive, which is lower than older estimates and underscores the value of a structured workup [^114SFc7U] [^116C7LDB].

> Hold on, I should verify geographic modifiers so I don't misapply a universal ranking. In endemic regions, coccidioidomycosis and histoplasmosis are important and can be leading causes of EN in community outbreaks, whereas in low-TB-incidence countries TB-associated EN is uncommon; likewise, Yersinia and other enteric infections feature more prominently in pediatric series from certain European cohorts, reinforcing the need to tailor testing to local epidemiology and exposure risks [^113LeJeG] [^116ymwjZ] [^112chXRC].

> Next, I should review a focused diagnostic approach so the hierarchy translates into action. A careful history for recent streptococcal pharyngitis, COVID-19, travel or occupational exposures, medication and vaccine timing, gastrointestinal symptoms, oral/genital ulcers, and systemic B symptoms guides testing; initial labs commonly include CBC, ESR/CRP, ASO or streptococcal testing, chest radiograph to screen for sarcoidosis and TB, and TB testing (TST/IGRA) when risk is present; further evaluation for IBD, Behçet disease, or malignancy is pursued based on clinical cues, and biopsy is reserved for atypical presentations or diagnostic uncertainty [^112ezHfy] [^114SFc7U] [^116C7LDB].

> In summary, I should confirm that my final synthesis reflects both frequency and context. The most common identifiable causes of EN are streptococcal infection, sarcoidosis, IBD, primary tuberculosis in endemic settings, drugs (particularly oral contraceptives and antibiotics, with emerging signals for GLP-1 agonists and biologics), and pregnancy; a meaningful minority remains idiopathic, but comprehensive evaluation reduces that fraction, and clinicians must adapt the workup to age, geography, exposures, and temporal relationships to uncover the underlying trigger [^114SFc7U] [^116C7LDB] [^113Vjjj8] [^112vwXkK].

The most common underlying causes of erythema nodosum are **infections** (notably streptococcal pharyngitis, tuberculosis, and Yersinia), **sarcoidosis** (especially Löfgren syndrome), and **inflammatory bowel disease** (Crohn's and ulcerative colitis) [^114SFc7U] [^112ezHfy] [^113Vjjj8] [^116sQWEt]. Other frequent triggers include **medications** (notably sulfonamides, oral contraceptives, and NSAIDs), **pregnancy**, and **Behçet disease** [^114RJYZp] [^113mmUWG] [^114SFc7U]. A substantial proportion remains idiopathic, but identifying and treating the underlying cause is essential for management [^114SFc7U] [^116C7LDB].

---

## Infectious causes

Infections are the **most common identifiable cause** of erythema nodosum, accounting for approximately 30–50% of cases [^114SFc7U]. The most frequently implicated pathogens include:

- **Streptococcal infections**: Particularly group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, causing pharyngitis or upper respiratory tract infections, are the most common infectious trigger, especially in children and adolescents [^112ezHfy] [^115dKREH].

- **Tuberculosis**: Primary tuberculosis is a significant cause globally, particularly in endemic regions, and is often associated with erythema nodosum [^114SFc7U] [^1119rQXk].

- **Yersinia enterocolitica**: Gastrointestinal infections with Yersinia species are well-documented triggers, particularly in pediatric populations [^113Vjjj8].

- **Other infections**: Less commonly, infections such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Epstein-Barr virus, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, and leprosy have been associated with erythema nodosum [^111zHa9f] [^114iv4zH] [^1139DLRY] [^116ymwjZ] [^1134RfNT].

---

## Autoimmune and inflammatory diseases

Several autoimmune and inflammatory conditions are strongly associated with erythema nodosum, including:

- **Sarcoidosis**: Erythema nodosum is a hallmark of acute sarcoidosis, particularly in Löfgren syndrome (erythema nodosum, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, and polyarthralgia) [^116sQWEt].

- **Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)**: Both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are frequently associated with erythema nodosum, often reflecting disease activity [^115yyDjP] [^113UMPQu].

- **Behçet disease**: A systemic vasculitis characterized by recurrent oral and genital ulcers, ocular inflammation, and erythema nodosum [^113URJTz] [^115FTjLU].

---

## Medications and drugs

Drug-induced erythema nodosum accounts for approximately 3–10% of cases, with **common culprits** including:

- **Sulfonamides**: Antibiotics such as sulfamethoxazole are classic triggers [^114RJYZp].

- **Oral contraceptives**: Hormonal contraception is a well-recognized precipitant, particularly in women of reproductive age [^112ezHfy] [^112chXRC].

- **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)**: Ibuprofen and other NSAIDs have been implicated in drug-induced erythema nodosum [^notfound].

- **Other medications**: Less commonly, antibiotics (e.g. penicillins), antidepressants, and biologic agents have been associated with erythema nodosum [^111atPhF] [^115xKBLP].

---

## Pregnancy and hormonal factors

Pregnancy is a recognized trigger of erythema nodosum, likely related to hormonal changes and immune modulation. Erythema nodosum **may occur at any stage of pregnancy** but is more common in the second and third trimesters [^notfound].

---

## Idiopathic cases

Despite extensive evaluation, approximately 30–50% of erythema nodosum cases remain idiopathic, with no identifiable underlying cause. These cases are typically **self-limited and resolve spontaneously** [^114SFc7U] [^116C7LDB].

### Erythema nodosum: a practical approach and diagnostic algorithm [^114SFc7U]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Erythema nodosum is the most common form of panniculitis and is characterized by tender erythematous nodules mainly in the lower limbs on the pretibial area. The exact cause of erythema nodosum is unknown, although it appears to be a hypersensitivity response to a variety of antigenic stimuli. Although the etiology is mostly idiopathic, ruling out an underlying disease is imperative before diagnosing primary erythema nodosum. Erythema nodosum can be the first sign of a systemic disease that is triggered by a large group of processes, such as infections, inflammatory diseases, neoplasia, and/or drugs. The most common identifiable causes are streptococcal infections, primary tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, Behçet disease, inflammatory bowel disease, drugs, and pregnancy. We propose a diagnostic algorithm to optimize the initial work-up, hence initiating prompt and accurate management of the underlying disease. The algorithm includes an initial assessment of core symptoms, diagnostic work-up, differential diagnosis, and recommended therapies. Several treatment options for the erythema nodosum lesions have been previously reported; nevertheless, these options treat the symptoms, but not the triggering cause. Making an accurate diagnosis will allow the physician to treat the underlying cause and determine an optimal therapeutic strategy.

### Erythema nodosum: a sign of systemic disease [^112ezHfy]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Erythema nodosum, a painful disorder of the subcutaneous fat, is the most common type of panniculitis. Generally, it is idiopathic, although the most common identifiable cause is streptococcal pharyngitis. Erythema nodosum may be the first sign of a systemic disease such as tuberculosis, bacterial or deep fungal infection, sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel disease, or cancer. Certain drugs, including oral contraceptives and some antibiotics, also may be etiologic. The hallmark of erythema nodosum is tender, erythematous, subcutaneous nodules that typically are located symmetrically on the anterior surface of the lower extremities. Erythema nodosum does not ulcerate and usually resolves without atrophy or scarring. Most direct and indirect evidence supports the involvement of a type IV delayed hypersensitivity response to numerous antigens. A deep incisional or excisional biopsy specimen should be obtained for adequate visualization. Erythema nodosum represents an inflammatory process involving the septa between subcutaneous fat lobules, with an absence of vasculitis and the presence of radial granulomas. Diagnostic evaluation after comprehensive history and physical examination includes complete blood count with differential; erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, or both; testing for streptococcal infection (i.e., throat culture, rapid antigen test, antistreptoly-sin-O titer, and polymerase chain reaction assay); and biopsy. Patients should be stratified by risk for tuberculosis. Further evaluation (e.g., purified protein derivative test, chest radiography, stool cultures) varies based on the individual. Erythema nodosum tends to be self-limited. Any underlying disorders should be treated and supportive care provided. Pain can be managed with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

### Erythema nodosum as a cutaneous manifestation of COVID-19 infection [^115jM6Np]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Erythema nodosum (EN) is a common dermatological manifestation with many different aetiologies. Often however, the aetiology remains unidentified. We present here a 42-year-old male patient with an EN that is due to an acute COVID-19 infection. Most of the usual aetiologies were excluded by laboratory testing and imaging studies. This case is, to our knowledge, the first report of this cutaneous manifestation in the context of a COVID-19 infection. The EN was successfully treated with the disappearance of the COVID-19 infection and topical corticosteroids.

### Panniculitis [^116Emyo6]. Dermatologic Clinics (2002). Low credibility.

The classification of inflammatory disorders of the subcutaneous tissue has mystified dermatologists for decades. Overlapping clinical and histologic features, and a lack of specific treatments have added to the confusion. This article initially classifies the various panniculititides by their primary histopathologic pattern: (1) septal panniculitis without vasculitis, (2) septal panniculitis with vasculitis, (3) lobular panniculitis without vasculitis, and (4) lobular panniculitis with vasculitis. Subsequently, we describe the key clinical findings in the most important forms of panniculitis. We begin with the most common form of panniculitis, erythema nodosum. Indeed, in many patients suspected of having panniculitis, a worthwhile question to consider initially might be, "Is this, or is this not, erythema nodosum?" before engaging in an elaborate (and expensive) exercise in differential diagnosis.

### Erythema nodosum and erythema induratum (nodular vasculitis): diagnosis and management [^1115ycX1]. Dermatologic Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Erythema nodosum is the most common type of panniculitis; it may be due to a variety of underlying infectious or otherwise antigenic stimuli. The pathogenesis remains to be elucidated, but both neutrophilic inflammation and granulomatous inflammation are implicated. Beyond treating underlying triggers, therapeutic options consist mainly of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, symptomatic care, potassium iodide, and colchicine. Erythema induratum (nodular vasculitis) is a related but distinctly different clinicopathologic reaction pattern of the subcutaneous fat. It is classically caused by an antigenic stimulus from Mycobacterium tuberculosis but may be associated with several other underlying disorders. After appropriate antimicrobial treatment in tuberculous cases, therapy for erythema induratum is similar to options for erythema nodosum.

In conclusion, while EN usually resolves with only symptomatic treatment, it is important to exclude the underlying causes. Our study highlights the most common etiologies in Northern Europe and the differences between different age groups. The leading symptoms as well as their severity can vary drastically, which may cause the patient to attend a number of different specialist clinics. Thus, awareness of features of EN is important among all physicians.

### Erythema nodosum [^116yLgce]. Dermatologic Clinics (2008). Low credibility.

Erythema nodosum is the most frequent clinicopathologic variant of panniculitis. The process is a cutaneous reaction that may be associated with a wide variety of disorders, including infections, sarcoidosis, rheumatologic diseases, inflammatory bowel diseases, medications, autoimmune disorders, pregnancy, and malignancies. Histopathologically, erythema nodosum is the stereotypical example of a mostly septal panniculitis with no vasculitis. The composition of the inflammatory infiltrate in the septa varies with age of the lesion. Treatment of erythema nodosum should be directed to the underlying associated condition, if identified.

### The causal relationship between inflammatory bowel diseases and erythema nodosum: a bidirectional two-sample mendelian randomization study [^113UMPQu]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The term "inflammatory bowel disease" (IBD) refers to a group of chronic immune-mediated intestinal illnesses that include Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Typical clinical symptoms of IBD include abdominal pain, diarrhea, chronic stomach pain, fatigue, and weight loss. In addition, IBD may present with several kinds of extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) that impact multiple systems, primarily the musculoskeletal, skin, and eyes. According to reports, the frequency of EIMs in IBD patients varies between 6–47%, with approximately a quarter of patients experiencing EIMs prior to being diagnosed with IBD. EIMs dramatically raise the disease burden and negatively impact the quality of life (QoL) of IBD patients, often even more so than the intestinal illness itself.

A clinically prevalent recurring panniculitis, erythema nodosum (EN) is typified with painful subcutaneous nodules and non-ulcerative erythema around the front part of both shins. Systemic symptoms like fever, headaches, and gastrointestinal issues are often present in conjunction with the skin lesions. Although the precise etiology of EN is yet unknown, the most frequent causes of EN are infections caused by streptococci, primary tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, Behcet's disease, medicines, pregnancy, and IBD. About 4–15% of people with CD and 3–10% of those with UC experience EN, the most prevalent cutaneous symptom of IBD. In most of the research, EN develops following an IBD diagnosis. However, a sizable cohort study found that 14.3% of individuals had an EN diagnosis prior to an IBD diagnosis. IBD and EN have certain genetic, environmental, and pathophysiology variables in common. However, there isn't any proof linking this correlation to causality. In terms of therapy and medicine, causation is more valuable clinically than association. there is no evidence to attribute this association to causation.

Mendelian randomization (MR), a genetic epidemiology technique, has gained popularity as a helpful instrument for assessing the causality between exposures and outcomes. This strategy avoids confounding variables and reverse causation by taking advantage of the random allocation of genetic variation, much like a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Using statistics from the extensive genome-wide association study (GWAS), our research used a two-sample MR analysis to ascertain the causal link between IBD, its subtypes (CD and UC) and EN.

### Erythema nodosum in Northern Finland between 1996 and 2019: a register-based study [^113Vjjj8]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Erythema nodosum (EN) is seen at any age with varying and often unidentified etiology. We studied the etiology and characteristics of EN in Northern Finland. Medical records of all patients with a diagnosis code for EN between 1996 and 2019 from Oulu University Hospital were retrieved and analyzed. There were in total 142 EN cases with a female predominance (n = 112, 72.9%). The mean age of the patients was 35.9 years. There were five cases diagnosed with EN in those younger than 2 years of age. Almost one third had EN nodules in multiple anatomical locations. In addition to skin findings, systemic symptoms were common (81.0%), and seen more often in men (p < 0.05). In children and adolescents, the most common etiological factors were gastroenteritis caused by 'Yersinia, Salmonella or Campylobacter', followed by inflammatory bowel diseases and hormonal contraception. Bacterial infections were the most common etiological factor among adults. In 28.2% of the cases there was no identified causative factor. In this study, EN was seen surprisingly often in small children. Etiological factors varied markedly among different age groups and symptoms differed between the sexes in adults. These aspects should be taken into account when diagnosing EN patients.

### Erythema nodosum [^114nhw2a]. Clinics in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Erythema nodosum (EN) is the most common form of panniculitis. It is characterized by the presence of rounded or oval, slightly raised, nonulcerative painful red nodules in the skin and subcutaneous fatty tissue, 1 to 6 cm in diameter, sometimes coalescing. They tend to be symmetrical in distribution and are usually located bilaterally on the lower extremities, particularly on the anterior tibial surface, although they may also involve the ankles, the lower parts of the thighs, and the forearms.

### Primary tuberculosis cases presenting with erythema nodosum [^1119rQXk]. The Journal of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Erythema nodosum (EN) is seen only in the primary tuberculosis (TB) form of tuberculous diseases. Among the etiologies of EN, TB is the most frequent disorder in developing countries. We aimed to assess our patients with EN in reference to primary TB. We evaluated 335 patients with the diagnosis of TB during last 20 years; retrospectively 61 (18%) of these cases had pulmonary and 274 (82%) had extrapulmonary TB. Ten (16%) of the pulmonary TB cases were primary. All 10 patients with primary TB presented with EN. Among 50 patients with EN diagnosed and followed during the last 10 years, the etiology was determined in 56%, and primary TB was the most frequent: 20%.

### Etiology and therapeutic management of erythema nodosum during pregnancy: an update [^113mmUWG]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Erythema nodosum (EN) is the most common form of panniculitis. It is characterized by erythematous, raised, tender nodules that usually occur bilaterally on the extensor surfaces of the lower extremities. EN is associated with many underlying conditions including infection, sarcoidosis, malignancy, and pregnancy. Its underlying etiology, however, is unknown in up to half of cases. Pregnancy is thought to create an optimal background for EN to develop, although the exact mechanisms are unclear. Immune complexes may play a role in the pathogenesis of EN during pregnancy, or EN may be a hypersensitivity reaction to either estrogens or progesterone. EN is a self-limiting process, and non-pharmacologic means such as bed rest and elastic web bandages may be sufficient to control the symptoms. Potassium iodide, systemic and intralesional corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, salicylates, tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors, hydroxychloroquine, colchicine, and dapsone are other treatment options available, but some of these drugs are contraindicated in pregnancy while others are considered safe. Before prescribing one of these treatments to a pregnant patient, the patient's obstetrician should be consulted, and a careful risk-benefit analysis should be performed.

### Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection-induced erythema nodosum, anaphylactoid purpura, and acute urticaria in 3 people in a single family [^111zHa9f]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection is one of the most common etiologic agents of respiratory tract diseases. Although the respiratory symptoms of this infection commonly are mild, it often is accompanied by various extrapulmonary complications including arthritis and cutaneous manifestations. We report 3 patients with M pneumoniae infection in a single family who revealed erythema nodosum, anaphylactoid purpura, and acute urticaria, respectively. We discuss the similarity between these cutaneous manifestations caused by this infection and those caused by viral infections, and the responsible factors for producing different cutaneous lesions by a single infectious agent in people with common genetic background. Age-related variations in cutaneous manifestations of M pneumoniae infections can be attributed to the immaturity of the adaptive immunity of a host, as has been suggested in viral infections.

Reactive cutaneous disorders

Erythema nodosum

Erythema nodosum (EN) is a reactive cutaneous process that is most frequently associated with infections, sarcoidosis, rheumatologic diseases, IBD, drugs, autoimmune diseases, pregnancy, and malignancies (lymphomas). In up to 60% of the cases, no underlying cause is found.

EN is the most common form of septal panniculitis and the most frequent skin manifestation associated with IBD. It has been associated with IBD in 11% of the cases, occurring more frequently in patients with UC than CD. EN is mainly seen in females, and in patients with colonic involvement and/or arthritis, typically associated with an exacerbation of the colitis (90%) but not with the severity or colonic extent, although it may even occur before the diagnosis of IBD.

EN is typically present as multiple, deep-red tender, painful nodules, distributed usually over the shins. The lesions do not show suppuration, ulceration or scarring, and they change to a yellowish color, similar to a deep bruise. Outbreaks appear suddenly and may be accompanied by general symptoms (Fig. 2).

Figure 2
Erythema nodosum. Multiple red, warm, and tender nodules, classically located on pretibial surface of lower extremity

EN usually regresses spontaneously after a few weeks of supportive treatment with compression stockings, leg elevation, and rest. It sometimes leaves a mild hyperpigmentation on the skin. When associated with IBD, EN is usually resolved with control of the IBD and often recurs with exacerbations of the bowel disease.

### Recognizing and managing the immunologic reactions in leprosy [^111y8Eau]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Immunologic reactions are an important aspect of leprosy that significantly impacts the course of the disease and the associated disability. Reversal reaction (type 1), erythema nodosum leprosum (type 2), and Lucio phenomenon are the 3 leprosy reactions, and they are most commonly seen in patients with the lepromatous and borderline categories of the disease. Because these forms of leprosy are the most common types seen in the United States, it is particularly important for physicians to be able to recognize and treat them. The reactions may occur before, during, or after treatment with multidrug therapy. Reversal reactions are the most common cause of nerve damage in leprosy, and erythema nodosum leprosum may also lead to neuritis. Although there have not been enough studies to confirm the most effective management regimens, treatment of reversal reaction and Lucio phenomenon with prednisone and of erythema nodosum leprosum with thalidomide and/or prednisone may help improve symptoms and prevent further disability.

### Utility of the erythema nodosum leprosum international study severity scale for erythema nodosum leprosum: a clinically supported critical appraisal [^114UzBjP]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Medium credibility.

Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is an immune-mediated complication of leprosy. A standardized severity scale based on the clinical signs associated with ENL was developed, piloted, and validated by the Erythema Nodosum Leprosum International Study (ENLIST) group. We conducted a critical appraisal of the ENLIST ENL severity scale using the visit data of eight borderline or lepromatous patients diagnosed with ENL from an outpatient dermatology clinic over a 3-year period. The three most commonly recorded tool criteria observed in the patients were the number, inflammation, and extent of ENL lesions. Fever (including in the preceding 7 days), lymphadenopathy, and inflammation of the joints or digits were rarely encountered (< 10%). Score changes reflected treatment progression, with a mean net change of -4.6 over the study period. Most ENLIST scores decreased after immunosuppression was increased (58.5%). Our results suggest that ENLIST accurately reflects ENL severity and treatment. The three tool criteria were not frequently recorded as observed in the patients (< 10%). Future studies may be conducted to confirm whether the low frequency of these tool criteria indicates true clinical variability.

### Erythema nodosum in children: a prospective study [^115dKREH]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The studies of series of children with erythema nodosum (EN) are limited and mostly retrospective.

Objective

We evaluated the epidemiology, etiology, clinical manifestations, course, and prognosis of EN in children.

Methods

Thirty-five children with EN (17 boys, 18 girls; mean age, 8.79 years) have been studied. Four excluded children proved, on biopsy, to have leukocytoclastic vasculitis (n = 3) or eosinophilic cellulitis (n = 1).

Results

In 27 of the 35 children (77%), the etiology of EN was established by laboratory investigations. In 25 children the causative factor of EN was an infectious agent (including beta-hemolytic streptococcus [n = 17], and Mycobacterium tuberculosis [n = 2]), whereas in 2 patients, EN was associated with Crohn's disease in one and Hodgkin's disease in the other. In 8 of the 35 children (23%) the etiology of EN remained undetermined. The mean duration of the rash was 11.5 days. Recurrences were noted in only 2 children (1 episode in 1 child and 3 episodes in the other).

Conclusion

Currently the most common provoking agent of EN in children in Greece is beta-hemolytic streptococcus. However, Mycobacterium tuberculosis should still be considered as a cause of the disorder. Also, the course of EN is benign and recurrences are exceptional.

### Erythema nodosum after COVID-19 vaccination in a pediatric patient [^1129b6D9]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Over the past year, vaccinations against SARS-CoV-2 have been authorized across the world to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. These vaccines have proven safe and effective, though side effects and adverse reactions do occur. Several dermatologic reactions following COVID-19 vaccination have been reported in adults. As vaccination eligibility is extended to the pediatric population, further characterization of the spectrum of cutaneous reactions in this population is needed. We describe a case of erythema nodosum following COVID-19 vaccination in a pediatric patient.

### Erythema nodosum in Northern Finland between 1996 and 2019: a register-based study [^112PiVyi]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Panniculitis is a condition where the subcutaneous fat tissue becomes inflamed. The most common clinical form of panniculitis is erythema nodosum (EN), characterized by painful, red, rounded nodules traditionally localized on the anterior surface of the limbs. The most common localization is the shins, although other localizations are possible. The etiology of EN is still unknown with around half of the cases considered idiopathic. The known causes for EN include infections, sarcoidosis, pregnancy, inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), drugs (such as contraceptive pills), and neoplastic diseases. The current annual incidence of EN is estimated to be around 15 per 100 000 persons, varying depending on the incidence rate of the causal conditions between populations.EN is more common among females, appearing up to five times more often in women than in men.EN is most often diagnosed in patients from their teens to their 30s, but it can be seen at any age. The objective of this study was to analyze the characteristics and etiology associated with EN in patients in the Oulu University Hospital (OUH) in Northern Finland.

### Atypical erythema nodosum triggered by COVID-19 infection [^114HoXrY]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

With the emergence of the novel SARS-CoV-2, we have learned a great deal about the potential cutaneous sequelae following infection. The variable dermatologic complications reported from viral infection thus far include pernio type lesions, urticarial eruptions, vesicular eruptions, and more. Here, we report an atypical presentation of erythema nodosum (EN) following infection with SARS-CoV-2. To our knowledge, there have only been 3 other reports of EN secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection, also known as COVID-19.

### Primary cutaneous cryptococcal infection with subsequent erythema nodosum in a 10-year-old immunocompetent girl [^116Zaan2]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Members of the Cryptococcus genus are opportunistic encapsulated yeasts that cause significant morbidity and mortality most often in immunocompromised hosts. Clinically, cryptococcal infections manifest most commonly as meningitis or a respiratory infection. The cryptococcal species are Cryptococcus neoformans, Cryptococcus gattii, and Cryptococcus laurentii, which each have diverse antigenicity and serotypes. Although C gattii infections occur commonly in immunocompetent patients in endemic areas, C neoformans infections in immunocompetent individuals remain an infrequent occurence. Endemic areas of C gattii include tropical regions and the pacific northwestern of North America after an outbreak in 1999. Cutaneous cryptococcal infection is most often observed secondary to disseminated cryptococcosis.

### Two cases of treatment-resistant erythema nodosum responding favorably to infliximab in the absence of gastrointestinal disease [^115Agr9b]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Erythema nodosum (EN) is an immune-mediated septal panniculitis characterized by tender, erythematous nodules, typically of the lower legs, associated with infectious, inflammatory, and malignant pathologies. However, most cases of EN are idiopathic. Chronic EN can be particularly challenging to manage, and treatment options for recalcitrant disease are limited. Data from the gastroenterology literature supports the utility of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α inhibitors for EN in the setting of underlying inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, reports of TNF-α inhibition in EN independent of IBD are sparse. Herein, we present 2 cases of treatment-resistant EN, not associated with IBD, responding favorably to infliximab.

### Erythema nodosum: an evaluation of 100 cases [^116oEN6c]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

In this study, we investigated the clinical features, etiology, and also predictive factors of secondary erythema nodosum (EN) in patients with EN.

Methods

A total of 100 patients (mean age: 37 years) diagnosed with EN between 1993 and 2004 in our clinic were included in the study prospectively. A skin biopsy was performed in 46 of the patients. Patients were considered to have secondary EN when an underlying condition was found, and to have primary EN when no such condition was found. For the diagnosis of the underlying diseases, the pertinent diagnostic criteria and/or diagnostic methods were used. Categorical and continuous variables were compared by using chi-square and Mann-Whitney U tests respectively. Multiple regression analysis was applied to the significantly different variables.

Results

The majority of the patients were female (female/male: 6/1) and nearly half (47%) of the cases had a determined etiology. The leading etiology was poststreptococcal (11%), followed in decreasing order by primary tuberculosis (10%), sarcoidosis (10%), Behçet's syndrome (BS) (6%), drugs (5%), inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) (3%), and pregnancy (2%). Fifteen (15%) patients complained of cough; the diagnosis was primary tuberculosis in eight cases and sarcoidosis in seven. Four patients with arthritis were diagnosed as having BS (in 3) and Crohn's disease (in 1). All the patients were followed for a mean duration of 4.5 years. The nodosities relapsed annually in 62% (33/53) of idiopathic EN patients but in only one (BS) in the secondary EN group. The histology was consistent with EN in all biopsied patients. Our study revealed that fever, leukocytosis, elevated CRP level, accelerated ESR, presence of cough, sore throat, diarrhea, arthritis, and pulmonary pathology were predictors of secondary EN. Recurrence in EN significantly predicted primary EN. All of the patients had bed rest and the majority was given an anti-inflammatory agent (naproxen sodium). The outcomes were usually favorable within 7 days. The patients with an underlying disease were given the specific treatment.

Conclusion

EN has been associated with numerous diseases. In order to reduce cost and duration of diagnosis, every centre should determine its own most frequent etiologic factors. Predictive variables for secondary EN should also be determined and an optimum management for such patients should be clarified. Our study revealed streptococcal pharyngitis, primary tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, IBD, and BS as the main etiologies of EN.

### Magnetic resonance imaging appearance of erythema nodosum: a case report [^112M9ACx]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Erythema nodosum (EN) is the commonest inflammation of the subcutaneous fat tissue (panniculitis). Erythema nodosum (EN) requires an interdisciplinary approach and exclusion of all underlying causes. We present a case of an 18-year-old female with a history of recurrent streptococcal infections over the years, who developed pain and swelling in the left ankle. To evaluate the persistent ankle swelling, the physician ordered a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left lower extremity. The MRI appearance of EN has not been described in detail in the literature so far.

### Outbreak of erythema nodosum of unknown cause-new Mexico, November 2007-January 2008 [^113LeJeG]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2009). Low credibility.

Erythema nodosum (EN) is a form of panniculitis, which has been associated with several infectious and noninfectious etiologies. EN clusters have been associated with outbreaks of Coccidioides immitis, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis infections. In December 2007, a physician in a rural New Mexico community of approximately 10,000 persons reported to the New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) that 13 patients had been diagnosed with EN since mid-November. No EN outbreak had ever been detected in this community, and since 2006, only one diagnosis of EN had been made at the local health-care facility. NMDOH initiated an investigation to confirm the existence of the outbreak, determine the underlying etiology, and implement control measures. This report describes the results of that investigation. Twenty-five EN cases were identified. Seventeen of 20 patients who answered a standard questionnaire reported being at a construction site with crowded and dusty conditions before EN onset. Nine of 15 chest radiographs were abnormal. Serologic test results were interpreted as negative for mycotic agents and inconclusive for Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. No etiology of the outbreak could be found. During an EN outbreak, timely (acute and convalescent) specimen collection (ideally from case-patients and control subjects to determine baseline seropositivity) and sensitive tests (e.g., polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) are essential to differentiate among possible causes of EN.

### 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guideline for the treatment of coccidioidomycosis [^1139DLRY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Coccidioidomycosis — early illness suspicion and timing in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and related syndromes is guided by incubation and exposure windows, symptom patterns, and epidemiology. In ambulatory patients with CAP, coccidioidal infection accounted for 24% of newly diagnosed CAP. The usual incubation period for early coccidioidal syndromes is from 1 week to 4 weeks, and patients with CAP, dermatologic syndromes, or rheumatologic syndromes who have endemic exposure within the previous 1–2 months should be evaluated for coccidioidomycosis as a possible etiology. Early associated findings can include erythema nodosum or erythema multiforme, and fatigue may be the last complaint to resolve and results in many weeks to many months of convalescence. Hematogenous spread beyond the lungs normally occurs within weeks to several months following infection, with exceptions including immunosuppressed patients with more remote prior exposure and patients previously treated for primary pulmonary infection in whom relapses occurred up to 4 years after treatment had been stopped.

### Mucocutaneous findings associated with interleukin (IL)-17 inhibition [^111atPhF]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

As the use IL-17 inhibitors becomes more widespread in the treatment of plaque psoriasis, clinicians need to be aware of unusual side effects not previously described in clinical trials. Although headache, injection site reaction, nasopharyngitis, and upper respiratory infection seem to most commonly result, other adverse reactions can include neutropenia, elevation of liver transaminase levels, sialadenitis, and erythema nodosum. Vigilant monitoring of patients receiving this novel drug is warranted to assess for unusual reactions, as this highly efficacious biologic is adapted into clinical use.

### Erythema nodosum-like panniculitis associated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: two cases reporting a rare cutaneous adverse event [^115xKBLP]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Erythema nodosum (EN) is the most common form of panniculitis and typically presents as painful erythematous nodules on the shins, and may be associated with systemic symptoms including fever and arthralgia. Histopathology demonstrates septal panniculitis with an inflammatory infiltrate, which includes neutrophils in the early stage and lymphocytes and multinucleated giant cells in the late stage. A wide variety of etiologies are associated with EN, including infections, sarcoidosis, rheumatologic disorders, inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune disorders, medications, and malignancies. Recently EN-like panniculitis has been reported as a rare cutaneous adverse effect in association with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPis). In this report, we present 2 additional patients who developed EN-like panniculitis in the setting of ipilimumab and nivolumab and pembrolizumab treatment, respectively, and review the clinical and histologic presentations, impact on cancer therapy, and response to treatment.

3 RESULTS

A data query returned 170 cases with an L52 code. When the uncertain cases were excluded, there was a total of 142 cases of EN included in this study with a female predominance (n = 112; 78.9%). Mean age at the time of EN diagnosis was 35.9 years (median 33.0 [range, 1–82 years]) and 11.8 years (median 14.0 [range, 1–19 years]) among children and adolescents. There were five cases diagnosed with EN in those younger than 2 years of age. Most commonly, the diagnosis of EN was made at the department of internal medicine (n = 61, 43.0%) followed by the dermatology department (n = 50, 35.2%). In children or adolescents, the diagnosis was most often given at the pediatric clinic (n = 17, 58.6%). (Tables 1 and 2).

TABLE 1
Baseline characteristics of patients diagnosed with erythema nodosum.

TABLE 2
Characteristics of patients with erythema nodosum by age groups.

The occurrence of systemic symptoms was more common in men than in women (p = 0.014). Fever was the most common systemic symptom in men (p < 0.01), whereas it was arthralgia among women. (Table 1). The occurrence of joint pain was most common in people aged 40–64 years, and least common in people over 65‐year‐olds (p < 0.01) (Table 2).

As an etiological factor, gastroenteritis caused by 'Yersinia, Salmonella or Campylobacter' was found more often in males than in females (p = 0.01) (Table 1), and more often in the youngest age groups compared to the older ones (p = 0.026) (Table 2). Malignancy was found in four cases (2.8%): three were internal carcinomas and one leukemia; all the patients were ≥ 40 years.

### A retrospective clinicopathological study of erythema nodosum [^115JHd9e]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Erythema nodosum (EN) may be idiopathic or secondary, and usually resolves naturally within 1–2months. In atypical EN cases, the rash extends beyond the lower limbs to the upper limbs and trunk, and histopathological findings may be accompanied by vasculitis in addition to septal panniculitis. Few studies have examined the differences in the clinical characteristics of patients with EN based on rash distribution. We retrospectively examined whether there was a correlation with clinical information, such as the presence or absence of underlying diseases, by classifying the patients into two groups: the lower limbs group (the EN rash was confined to the lower limbs) and the beyond lower limbs group (the EN rash appeared beyond the lower limbs). Among the 86 adult patients diagnosed with EN at the Dermatology Department of Fujita Medical University between 2015 and 2020, there were 65 cases of the lower limbs group and 21 cases of the beyond lower limbs group. The frequency of underlying diseases was significantly higher in the beyond lower limbs group (76.2%, 16 cases) than in the lower limbs group (40.0%, 26 cases; P < 0.005). Vasculitis was more notable in the beyond lower limbs group (P < 0.05). Significantly higher vasculitis was noted in the EN group with underlying diseases (30.2%, 13 cases) than in the idiopathic EN group without underlying diseases (11.6%, 5 cases; P < 0.05). Neutrophil extracellular traps were positive in approximately 40% of cases in both groups. In the beyond lower limbs group, the possibility of severe cases with underlying diseases, vasculitis, and inflammation must be considered for effective treatment.

### An unusual presentation of vilanova disease (erythema nodosum migrans) with superficial histologic changes [^111o8L1c]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

ENM was first described by Bafverstedt in 1954. Subsequently, Vilanova and Pinol Aguadereferred to the condition as subacute nodular migratory panniculitis, and it has now come to be known as Vilanova disease. The condition is characterized by deep seated nodular lesions that often enlarge via confluence or peripheral extension to form large plaques. Classically, the lesions appear unilaterally as single, discrete erythematous plaques. The nodules do not ulcerate, and over weeks or months the nodules may migrate and become crescentic in nature.

ENM is more common in women, and it is often compared with EN, which is the most common cause of panniculitis. Lesions in ENM are less tender than those in EN. The subcutaneous nodules or plaques in ENM persist for a longer period compared with EN nodules. Furthermore, ENM is typically unilateral, whereas EN is typically bilateral. Most cases of ENM are idiopathic in origin; however, a significant proportion of EN cases are preceded by infection, autoimmune disease, medication adverse effect, and cancer. Although an underlying etiology is not usually identified in ENM, streptococcal infection has been implicated in some cases. Generally, EN is self-limiting, whereas ENM lesions can last for months.

### Dose-dependent erythema nodosum after initiation of semaglutide [^114RJYZp]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Erythema nodosum (EN) is an acute septal panniculitis characterized by tender erythematous nodules primarily localized on extensor surfaces of the lower legs. EN is considered a hypersensitivity response to antigenic stimuli. The exact mechanism is disputed, with some authors postulating the pathogenesis as due to deposition of immune complexes in the venules of the septae of the subcutaneous fat, Though the etiology is typically idiopathic, it can occur with a vast number of underlying causes including streptococcal infections, tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, Behçet disease, inflammatory bowel disease, medications, and pregnancy. Medications that have been most commonly associated with EN include sulfonamides, bromides, and oral contraceptives, as well as a host of vaccines. Semaglutide (Ozempic) is a glucagon-like peptide-1 analog used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, and more recently, it has gained considerable popularity as a treatment for weight loss. Here we report a unique case of EN attributed to semaglutide.

### Skin manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease [^113DJN6o]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with its two main subtypes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis is not restricted to the gastrointestinal tract. Indeed, so-called extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) are frequent and considerably affect morbidity and mortality. The prevalence of EIMs ranges from 6 to 47%. In up to one quarter of the patients, EIMs can present even before an IBD diagnosis is established. The pathophysiology of EIMs remains elusive, although data from clinical trials demonstrating anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) efficacy suggest a common pathogenic link between intestinal and extraintestinal disease activity. However, not all EIMs parallel intestinal disease. Skin lesions are usually classified based on their pathophysiological association with the underlying intestinal disease into four categories: (1) specific, (2) reactive, (3) associated, and (4) treatment-induced manifestations. Cutaneous manifestations include erythema nodosum (EN), pyoderma gangrenosum (PG), Sweet's syndrome, and oral lesions, with EN being the most commonly reported and PG showing the most debilitating disease course. Anti-TNF-induced skin reactions are a new, but increasingly recognized phenomenon, which can be eventually misinterpreted as psoriatic lesions. Medical treatment modalities are limited with topical and systemic steroids being the most frequently employed agents. If EIMs parallel intestinal disease activity, the therapeutic cornerstone usually is the management of underlying intestinal disease activity rather than direct treatment of the EIMs. However, increasing evidence for anti-TNF agents' efficacy in EIM management has changed the approach to complicating and debilitating disease courses. In the case of anti-TNF-induced lesions, topical steroids are usually sufficient and discontinuation of anti-TNF is seldom warranted. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on cutaneous EIMs, their diagnostic criteria and clinical presentation, natural history, pathogenesis, and treatment options.

### Erythema nodosum after COVID-19 vaccination in a pediatric patient [^116v5Ts2]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

EN is a septal panniculitis thought to be a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction. EN may be accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fever, malaise, and arthralgias, though this is less common in pediatric patients. EN is often idiopathic but is also known to occur in the setting of infections, systemic inflammatory conditions, medication use, pregnancy, and malignancy, among other conditions. In the pediatric population, group A β -hemolytic streptococcal infection is the most common trigger. Regardless of etiology, the condition is generally self-limiting within 3–6 weeks and resolves without long-term sequelae such as scarring or atrophy. Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation, but if presentation is atypical, skin biopsy can be considered. We based our diagnosis of EN on the classic clinical presentation and discussion with an on-site pediatric dermatologist. Biopsy was deferred in our pediatric patient given the typical clinical findings and course, and following consideration that biopsy would not likely change management.

The workup involves evaluating for common underlying etiologies including tuberculosis (chest x-ray or interferon-gamma release assays), Streptococcus (antistreptolysin-O titers), and malignancy (complete blood count). In the case of our patient, none of these tests revealed an identifiable cause. Since vaccine-related reactions may occur up to 6 weeks following inoculation according to the Center for Disease Control's timeline for monitoring of COVID-19 vaccine safety, we considered our patient's recent COVID-19 vaccination to be the most likely underlying etiology of her EN. Furthermore, vaccine-associated EN has been described previously up to 30 days after the administration of other vaccines.

Although the majority of EN cases are idiopathic, EN has been described following several different vaccinations. EN has occurred following tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis; bacille Calmette-Guérin; hepatitis B; human papillomavirus; rabies; small pox; typhoid; and cholera vaccines. More recent reports have noted EN following COVID-19 vaccination in the adult population. Vaccine-related EN is generally assumed to represent a reaction to the infectious antigen present in the vaccine, but it could theoretically also represent a response to vaccine adjuvants. To the best of our knowledge, EN following COVID-19 vaccination has not yet been described in the pediatric population.

### Dose-dependent erythema nodosum after initiation of semaglutide [^117VeodY]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

EN classically presents as tender, warm, erythematous nodules on the anterior lower extremities. An estimated 30% to 50% of cases are idiopathic, but there are also a wide range of etiologies. It occurs more often in women between 25 and 40 yearsEN tends to resolve in 2 to 6 weeks without any scar or atrophy. The patient had no medical history to suggest a known etiology for EN.

We believe this case highlights a novel presentation of EN secondary to semaglutide. Evidence supports a hypersensitivity response to antigenic stimuli as the pathogenesis for EN. Semaglutide, a peptide molecule, may serve as the antigenic stimulus in the formation of immune complex depositions leading to EN lesions. Length of onset of EN following initiation of new medication can widely vary from days to months. Semaglutide is the only new medication that was started prior to onset of symptoms. Furthermore, there was a strong dose-dependent effect of semaglutide on the patient's lesions that suggests a correlation between initiation of semaglutide and development of EN. At the most recent visit, the patient remained on a 1 mg weekly dose and was still developing sporadic lesions despite being outside the window of the expected resolution of symptoms attributed to idiopathic causes. This dose is the same dose in which she first noticed the EN lesions, which suggests an ongoing trigger for development of EN lesions. As her semaglutide dose was further titrated down, the intensity, number, and duration of lesions significantly decreased. On her current low dose of semaglutide, she continues to have intermittent scattered lesions, though they are tolerable. We recommended possibly discussing alternative weight loss medications with her primary care physician if her symptoms become more bothersome. As semaglutide gains popularity for its effect on weight loss, providers must consider this potential trigger when investigating and managing EN cases.

With some authors postulating the pathogenesis as due to deposition of immune complexes in the venules of the septae of the subcutaneous fat.

### Can we change the natural course of inflammatory bowel disease? [^112wbWha]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 4.
Positive or negative impact of currently available therapies on SPIRIT disease progression outcomes.

Regarding mid-term complications, the presence of EIMs and the impact of therapies on it is the one that has been the most explored, with good response rates under anti-TNF for almost all EIMs. Using ustekinumab, dermatologic manifestations (psoriasis, pyoderma gangrenosum, erythema nodosum) and peripheral arthralgia and psoriatic arthritis are significantly improved, while no efficacy was found in axial spondyloarthritis. Promising results for aphthous stomatitis and uveitis have also been reported using ustekinumab but data are limited. Vedolizumab therapy is commonly associated with improvement in peripheric articular symptoms, as well as erythema nodosum, probably as a consequence of the concomitant control of gut inflammation, but has no effect on axial spondyloarthritisand pyoderma gangrenosumthat are independent of disease activity. Jak inhibitors, especially tofacitinib, demonstrated clinical efficacy in active ankylosing spondylitis, and may have a therapeutic effect on dermatologic manifestations (erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum), as well as uveitis.

### Erythema nodosum in Northern Finland between 1996 and 2019: a register-based study [^116aGQCV]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

In previous studies, the most common causative factor of EN in children has been bacterial infections and especially, β‐hemolytic Streptococcus. Our findings are consistent with those of other studies; however, in our study, gastroenteritis‐related EN was even more common. We also reported four cases with IBD in children. However, as reported previously, EN was not associated with any other chronic diseases, such as Bechet's disease or malignancies, in the children in our population.

In this study, the typical clinical feature of EN was multiple nodules (95%) seen in both lower limbs (64.8%). Nevertheless, those of advanced age also presented with single nodules (14.3%). We also found that systemic symptoms, especially fever and arthralgia, were common (81%). These findings are in line with the Turkish study (n = 100, mean age 37 years) by Mert et al. In their study, 99% of the cases presented with bilateral, pretibial nodules, 34% with fever, and 45% with arthralgia. An interesting finding of our study was that men presented more systemic symptoms in comparison to women and were more likely to have fever when examined. The oldest and youngest group also reported less arthralgia than the other age groups.

A strength of this study is that all patients were diagnosed in OUH, and diagnosis was based on the patient history and physical examination. However, a skin biopsy was taken in an atypical presentation of EN (i.e. if typical clinical findings, such as the acute onset of tender nodules or plaques, was lacking). Further, all the patient records were reviewed by a medical doctor and uncertain cases (miscoding/diagnoses were further confirmed to other than EN) were not included.

We admit some limitations to our study. As a retrospective study, it was not possible to standardize the diagnostic procedures. Further, not all the data, such as smoking status, were available. Because the study was conducted in hospital setting, some cases with less severe symptoms might be missing since they were treated in primary healthcare.

### Erythema nodosum after COVID-19 vaccination in a pediatric patient [^112Krb6R]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Case report

A previously healthy 17-year-old female presented to the pediatric urgent care clinic with multiple days of tender, erythematous nodules on her bilateral lower extremities. In the 2 days prior to presentation, she had noticed them enlarging and becoming increasingly painful. She denied any preceding traumatic events, including falls or direct trauma to the legs. She denied fevers or recent infections. There were no ill contacts reported in the home or at school. No known contacts had similar lesions.

Three weeks prior to presentation, the patient had received her second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. She reported a 1-day period of malaise the day after her vaccination, but since that time, she had been in her usual state of health. The patient had not experienced any side effects following her first dose of the vaccine. She had no known recent history of streptococcal pharyngitis or new drug exposures. Her past medical history was negative for known systemic infections or inflammatory conditions including tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, or inflammatory bowel disease.

On the physical examination, numerous tender, warm, erythematous nodules with a diameter of 2–3 centimeters were noted across the anterior tibial surfaces, bilaterally (Fig 1). There was also a single similar lesion on her left forearm. There were no other notable findings on physical examination. The patient's vital signs were within the normal limits.

Fig 1
Erythema nodosum (EN) on the anterior aspect of the bilateral lower extremities at the first clinic visit.

Laboratory testing was notable for an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 37 mm/hr (reference range, < 25 mm/hr) as well as elevated C-reactive protein at 1.7 mg/dL (reference range, < 0.8 mg/dL). Complete blood count with differential was within the normal ranges. Antistreptolysin-O titers were not elevated, and interferon-gamma release assay was negative. Given the high clinical suspicion for erythema nodosum (EN), a biopsy was not performed. With the temporal association and otherwise negative workup for common underlying etiologies of EN, the patient's recent COVID-19 vaccination was hypothesized as the likely trigger for the onset of EN. At the time of follow-up 1 week later, the patient's skin lesions had nearly resolved (Fig 2) with rest and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications; her erythrocyte sedimentation rate remained elevated at 56 mm/hr, though her C-reactive protein level had normalized.

### Atypical erythema nodosum in atypical tuberculosis presentation [^114aqLcj]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Erythema nodosum (EN) is an inflammatory disease of the skin and subcutaneous tissue that may be found in association with many systemic diseases such as infectious diseases, sarcoidosis, Behçet disease, inflammatory bowel diseases and tumours, in particular lymphoma. EN may be also induced by some drugs, including mainly estroprogestinics, salicylic acid, minocycline and sulfamidic acid. Due to the numerous possible causes, sometimes it may be very difficult to achieve a correct diagnostic interpretation, especially when an isolated EN represents the revealing feature, as in the following case. We describe the case of a patient, of young age and good clinical condition, who developed EN during the course of abdominal tuberculosis. The diagnosis was obtained by histologic examination of the abdominal formation since positron emission tomography and total body axial tomography were not useful in discriminating EN from malignancies.

### Cutaneous manifestations in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases: pathophysiology, clinical features, and therapy [^115QfTcL]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

The skin is one of the most common extraintestinal organ system affected in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The skin manifestations associated with IBD are polymorphic and can be classified into 4 categories according to their pathophysiology: (1) specific, (2) reactive, (3) associated, and (4) induced by IBD treatment. Cutaneous manifestations are regarded as specific if they share with IBD the same granulomatous histopathological pattern: perianal or metastatic Crohn's disease (commonly presenting with abscesses, fistulas or hidradenitis suppurativa-like features) is the prototype of this setting. Reactive cutaneous manifestations are different from IBD in the histopathology but have close physiopathological links: pyoderma gangrenosum, a neutrophil-mediated autoinflammatory skin disease typically manifesting as painful ulcers, is the paradigm of this group. Among the cutaneous diseases associated with IBD, the most commonly seen are erythema nodosum, a form of panniculitis most commonly involving bilateral pretibial areas, and psoriasis, a T helper 1/T helper 17-mediated erythematous squamous inflammatory disease. Finally, the number of cutaneous adverse reactions because of IBD therapies is progressively increasing. The most frequent drug-induced cutaneous manifestations are psoriasis-like, eczema-like, and lichenoid eruptions, as well as cutaneous lupus erythematosus for biologics, and nonmelanoma skin cancer, mainly basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas for thiopurines.

Indications for everolimus and other drugs within the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor class have recently expanded to include tuberous sclerosis complex. Everolimus is generally well tolerated, but it is important for physicians to identify and manage associated cutaneous adverse effects. We report the first case of a child developing erythema nodosum while undergoing everolimus therapy.

### FDG PET / CT showing erythema nodosum associated with tuberculous lymphadenitis [^112YkaWL]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Erythema nodosum (EN) is histopathologically an acute septal panniculitis of subcutaneous adipose lobule. It can be either idiopathic or secondary to various underlying conditions. A female patient with EN underwent FDG PET/CT to search underlying cause. The images showed enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum with moderately elevated FDG uptake and multifocal increased FDG uptake over her lower extremities. The patient's condition was subsequently diagnosed with EN associated with mediastinal tuberculous lymphadenitis based on skin biopsy, tuberculin skin test, and treatment response.

### Simultaneous erythema nodosum and erythema multiforme after local lidocaine injection [^1134RfNT]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of simultaneous erythema nodosum and erythema multiforme after local lidocaine injection.

Case Summary

A 33-year-old female experienced coexisting erythema nodosum and erythema multiforme after lidocaine spray was used for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The reaction was exacerbated after localized injection of 2% lidocaine for a skin biopsy. An objective causality assessment revealed that an adverse drug reaction was highly probable.

Discussion

Lidocaine is the most frequently used local anesthetic agent. The coexistence of erythema nodosum and erythema multiforme has been reported in lepromatous leprosy, Yersinia enterocolítica and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis gastrointestinal infection (both with diarrhea), histoplasmosis, hepatitis C, and milkeŕs nodule, but not with lidocaine.

Conclusions

If clinicians observe similar lesions after lidocaine exposure, they should suspect an adverse drug reaction and exercise caution in the administration of amide anesthetics to patients with a documented history of adverse reaction to lidocaine.

### Erythema nodosum in Northern Finland between 1996 and 2019: a register-based study [^115rkh5r]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

In 18.3% (n = 26) of cases a skin biopsy was taken to confirm the diagnosis, most commonly among those ≥ 40 years (p < 0.01). At the time of diagnosing EN, a chest X‐ray was performed in most cases (89.4%), but least often in the youngest age group (p = 0.039). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was analyzed in 127/142 (89.4%) of the cases, the mean (SD, min‐max) value being 39.3 mm/h (28.9, 2.0–104.0) in children (normal range, 1–15 mm/h) and 44.4 mm/h (28.0, 2.0–107.0) in adults (normal range, varying from < 10 to < 45 depending on age and sex).

### Dupilumab-induced erythema nodosum [^111KTAt3]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Dupilumab was first approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) and, more recently, for moderate-to-severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype or oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma. Clinical trials to date have shown that dupilumab therapy significantly improves lung function, reduces severe exacerbations of asthma, and improves quality of life in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma. Dupilumab was relatively well tolerated in asthma trials; the commonly observed adverse events were injection-site reactions, nasopharyngitis, and eosinophilia, without increased incidence of conjunctivitis, as seen in AD clinical trials. A similar safety profile has been observed in post–Food and Drug Administration approval observation studies. The dupilumab package insert warns that EN, among other hypersensitivity reactions, has occurred. We have identified a single reported case of EN in a cohort study of dupilumab therapy for AD, although the authors did not elaborate on the diagnosis or clinical course of the EN. Reports of EN in patients receiving dupilumab for the treatment of asthma are absent in the existing medical literature.

### Erythema nodosum-like rash in a COVID-19 patient: a case report [^115LUCqG]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral disease first described in Wuhan, China, which has quickly emerged as a global pandemic with a myriad of manifestations including dermatologic (Li My et al., n.d.; Gottlieb and Long, 2020 [1,2]). A variety of cutaneous symptoms have presented throughout various stages of the disease (Marzano, 2020; Recalcati, n.d.; Henry et al., n.d.; Fernandez-Nieto et al., n.d.; Quintana-Castanedo et al., n.d. [3–5,7,8]). We describe a case of a female patient who presented with an Erythema Nodosum-like exanthema likely secondary to COVID-19. The patient described tested positive for COVID-19 three days prior to presentation for the rash with minimal other symptoms of COVID-19. Given the high infectivity rate as well as multisystem presentation, it is important to continue to report on novel presentations of the virus for early identification and treatment of complications.

### Inflammatory bowel disease and immune-mediated inflammatory diseases: looking at the less frequent associations [^112SPWrD]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of chronic illnesses in which alterations of the innate and adaptive immune responses play a crucial role in starting and perpetuating intestinal inflammation. IBD includes mainly Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). These diseases present not only gastrointestinal symptoms, but also signs that refer to other body districts and, in severe cases, to systemic implication. The involvement of organs other than those of the gastrointestinal tract is called 'extraintestinal manifestations'. These extraintestinal manifestations occur in varying percentages in IBD patients, and often a single patient has more than one such manifestation. Some extraintestinal manifestations of IBD are related to intestinal inflammation, while others are independent of disease course.

Extraintestinal manifestations of IBD were defined at the sixth scientific workshop of the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation as any 'inflammatory pathology in a patient with IBD that is located outside the gut and for which the pathogenesis is either dependent on extension/translocation of immune responses from the intestine, or is an independent inflammatory event perpetuated by IBD or that shares a common environmental or genetic predisposition with IBD'. Extraintestinal manifestations more commonly involve the joints (peripheral and axial spondyloarthropathies), skin (erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum), eyes (uveitis, episcleritis, iridocyclitis), and hepatobiliary tract [primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)].

### Guidelines of care for the management of primary cutaneous melanoma [^1126XPHY]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

BRAFi and MEKi agents and common cutaneous adverse effects — FDA-approved BRAFi s include vemurafenib and dabrafenib; FDA-approved MEKIs include trametinib and cobimetinib. The most common cutaneous side effects for MAPK inhibitors include severe ultraviolet A — induced photosensitivity, hyperproliferative epidermal neoplasms (including cSCC [usually keratoacanthoma-type]), hypertrophic actinic keratosis, verrucal keratosis, keratosis pilaris — type eruption, hand-foot skin reaction (painful palmoplantar keratosis), and xerosis, which are frequently observed during BRAFi monotherapy. Less common BRAFi-associated skin findings include telogen effluvium and textural hair changes (course, brittle hair), eruptive nevi, panniculitis (namely, erythema nodosum), and BRAF wild-type new primary CM (generally superficial in nature). Many of these side effects are attenuated or even reversed with the addition of MEKIs.

### Erythema nodosum in Northern Finland between 1996 and 2019: a register-based study [^112chXRC]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

This study assessed the etiology and clinical characteristics in 142 patients with EN using OUH hospital records. Surprisingly, many children or adolescents with EN were seen in our study population (n = 29). EN is reported to be quite uncommon among children, and especially rare among those under 2 years. However, there were five cases diagnosed with EN aged ≤ 2 years in our study. In line with previous studies, females comprised the majority (78.9%) of our cases. Nevertheless, among children, especially in those under 12 years, no sex prevalence has been reported. In our study, there was a predominance of females, also in the youngest age group (0–19 years).

The etiology of EN varies depending on geographical area, sex and age. However, detailed data about etiological factors are scarce. In our study, infections, especially bacterial infections, were the most common known etiology. Oral contraceptives, IBD, and sarcoidosis were also notable factors. In contrast to many other studies, there were no cases with tuberculosis (TB), which is understandable since Finland is a country with a low TB incidence.COVID‐19 infection and vaccination have recently been discussed in the literature as etiological factors behind EN. However, this study did not include cases diagnosed after December 2019; the impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic is thus not seen. We also noticed some sex differences in etiology: gastroenteritis caused by 'Yersinia, Campylobacter and Salmonella' was significantly more common among males compared to females. In contrast, female predominance in EN diagnosis has been hypothesized to be related to sex hormones, supported by the higher occurrence of EN in pregnant women or those using oral contraceptive pills. In our study, hormonal contraceptives and pregnancy were considered a provoking factor in 16% and 4.5% of women's EN cases, respectively.

### Dupilumab-induced erythema nodosum [^112avsY7]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that functions as an interleukin (IL) 4α receptor antagonist, inhibiting the activity of both IL-4 and IL-13, drivers of T helper 2 mediated inflammation. Although injection-site reactions are the most reported side effect, there have been several reported cases of adverse dermatologic reactions, including facial and neck erythema. We present a case of a patient with severe eosinophilic asthma and chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps in whom drug-induced erythema nodosum (EN) developed after 8 weeks of dupilumab therapy.

### Erythema nodosum as key manifestation of histoplasmosis case [^116ymwjZ]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Histoplasmosis is a systemic infection caused by the fungus, Histoplasma capsulatum Infection of H. capsulatum frequently occurs by inhaling the spores of the fungus, which is found in bat and bird droppings, or soil enriched with their excrement. If not detected and treated, histoplasmosis can develop late, severe complications such as mediastinal fibrosis, or even develop into a disseminated infection. However, histoplasmosis infections are often asymptomatic, making its detection more difficult. Further, only 6% of histoplasmosis cases will present with erythema nodosum, with most cases associated with female patients. This case presents a woman in her 50s with a pertinent history of fibromyalgia and hypothyroidism secondary to Hashimoto's who initially sought medical care for painful nodules on her legs and was eventually diagnosed with histoplasmosis. This report clearly demonstrates the importance of maintaining a broad differential when working up inflammatory manifestations, such as erythema nodosum.

Further, we report on the first documented case of EN induced by Cryptococcus. This finding is not surprising given the variety of causes of EN including other fungal infections such as coccidioidomycosis and histoplasmosis, and now Cryptococcus can be added to the list.

### Atypical erythema nodosum triggered by COVID-19 infection [^114iv4zH]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

EN is characterized by the clinical and histopathologic findings of acute onset of erythematous, painful, subcutaneous nodules on the anterior "pretibial" area of the lower extremities with a biopsy showing septal panniculitis.EN is a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction that can be idiopathic or associated with underlying autoimmune conditions or infectious etiology, most commonly reported following streptococcal infection. EN has also been associated with various viral infections such as Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis B and C, HIV, and herpes simplex virus. Workup includes a chest x-ray to exclude pulmonary infections such as tuberculosis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, and sarcoidosis; antistreptolysin O titers; and complete blood counts to rule out malignancy. Our patient presented with the classic characteristics of EN but also had significant involvement of the posterior aspects of her lower extremities, which is atypical. Given the time course of the presentation and lack of other identifiable causes, her EN was likely secondary to her COVID-19 viral infection; however, it may have also been idiopathic. Of the 3 other reported cases of EN secondary to COVID-19, 1 also describes an atypical distribution involving the arms, face, and lower portion of the back. In the documented cases of EN associated with COVID-19 infection, 1 patient reported symptoms of painful tender nodules developing as early as 72 hours after being diagnosed with COVID-19, whereas the other 2 cases experienced symptoms of the lower portion of the leg such as pain, tenderness, swelling, and redness 1 to 2 weeks after their respiratory symptoms started. The pathophysiology leading to typical and atypical presentations of EN in the setting of COVID-19 remains unclear. However, Ordieres-Ortega et alhave postulated that the development of EN in COVID-19 may be due to the dysregulated immune response caused by the virus, specifically including the case of elevated interleukin (IL) 1, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-7 in predisposed patients with polymorphisms of IL-1 and IL-6 promoter genes. Future studies are required to investigate this further. Although there are only 3 other known reports of EN triggered by COVID-19 infection, cutaneous manifestations are estimated to occur at a rate of 20.4% and include erythematous papular, vascular, vesicular, and urticarial eruptions. Other atypical skin presentations following COVID-19 infection include generalized pruritis, Sweet syndrome, Kawasaki disease-like presentation, polymorphic patterns, and in our case, atypical EN. Our understanding of cutaneous reactions following COVID-19 infection continues to expand, and this case emphasizes that COVID-19 infection should be included among the list of triggers for EN.

### Papules developing in an old tattoo [^112yd6Qh]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Two months later, this patient suddenly developed a low-grade fever and 2- to 4-cm tender, erythematous swollen areas on the shins. There was no scarring or atrophy.

Question 3: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Erythema nodosum
B. Necrobiosis lipoidica
C. Nodular vasculitis
D. Pretibial myxedema
E. Factitial disease

Answers:

A. Erythema nodosum – Correct. Of the nonspecific manifestations of sarcoidosis, erythema nodosum is the most common. It is a hypersensitivity reaction in fat septae, but the pathophysiologic basis of this condition in sarcoidosis is unknown. It manifests as tender, erythematous subcutaneous nodules, most often on the anterior tibia. It can be accompanied by fever, malaise, and polyarthralgia.
B. Necrobiosis lipoidica – Incorrect. This condition is associated with diabetes mellitus and presents with atrophy, which was not seen in this patient.
C. Nodular vasculitis – Incorrect. Nodular vasculitis involves medium-sized arteries in the reticular dermis and can appear much like the nodular swellings of erythema nodosum. It is not associated with sarcoidosis.
D. Pretibial myxedema – Incorrect. Pretibial myxedema is the result of the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in the dermis. It is most commonly associated with Graves disease. It is typically asymptomatic and is characterized by swelling and induration of the lower legs. It is not associated with sarcoidosis.
E. Factitial disease – Incorrect. This would be a consideration if the nodules in the tattoo were thought to be of factitial origin. Histopathology for factitial disease would be nonspecific with acute inflammation and scattered erythrocytes.

### Concurrent Sweet's syndrome and erythema nodosum [^116dTwgp]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

A 29-year-old Mexican man was admitted to the hospital with fever, cough, sore throat, and red, tender leg nodules suggestive of erythema nodosum (Fig. 1). The white blood cell count was 35,000. Several days later, annular plaques and pustules developed on his face, neck, and forearms (Figs. 2 and 3). Facial skin biopsy showed neutrophilic dermatitis without evidence of infection or vasculitis consistent with Sweet's syndrome. Biopsy of the thigh was non-diagnostic, but showed a mixed neutrophilic and granulomatous dermatitis.

Figure 1
The patient's legs show red, tender nodules suggestive of erythema nodosum.

Figure 2
Annular plaques and pustules developed on the patient's face.

Figure 3
Annular plaques developed on the patient's hands.

Erythema nodosum (EN) is a form of panniculitis characterized by painful red nodules over the pretibial area. Sweet's syndrome (SS) is an acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis characterized by fever, leukocytosis, and erythematous plaques involving the arms, trunk, and neck. Vesiculopustules, nodules, and ulcers may also occur. Simultaneous occurrence of EN and SS has been increasingly reported, and both appear to be reactive dermatoses with overlapping clinical and histopathologic features. Although often idiopathic, both disorders have been associated with upper respiratory infections, medications, hematologic malignancies, and autoimmune disease (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease). Treatment includes corticosteroids, potassium iodide, or colchicine. SS generally responds well to therapy, but recurs in up to 25% of patients; 15% have a chronic relapsing course.

Extensive evaluation was unrevealing, including chest and abdominal imaging, bone marrow biopsy, endoscopy, and serologies for hepatitis, syphilis, recent Streptococcal infection, and rheumatologic disorders. He responded well to oral prednisone. The underlying cause was presumed to be an antecedent upper respiratory tract infection.

### Mucosal ulcers, extremity nodules, and fevers [^115FTjLU]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Sweet syndrome
B. Behçet's disease
C. Primary EBV infection
D. Erythema multiforme
E. Primary Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infection

Answers:

A. Sweet syndrome – Incorrect. Sweet syndrome presents with neutrophilia, fevers, and typically edematous plaques or vesiculobullous lesions. Histology would show a dense neutrophilic infiltrate and papillary dermal edema without evidence of leukocytoclastic vasculitis.
B. Behçet's disease – Correct. The oral and genital ulcers, neutrophilic vasculitis on histology of erythema nodosum-like skin lesions, as well as ocular, neurologic, gastrointestinal, and joint symptoms with an otherwise unremarkable infectious and inflammatory workup led to a diagnosis of Beçhet's disease.
C. Primary EBV infection – Incorrect. EBV infection may have been both an inciting trigger for Behçet's disease and the cause of her initial presentation consistent with infectious mononucleosis. Associations between EBV infection and Behçet's disease have been well demonstrated. While EBV itself can have dermatologic manifestations, EBV alone was improbable, particularly given evidence of neutrophilic vasculitis on biopsy and subsequent EBV viral load and IgM testing were negative.
D. Erythema multiforme – Incorrect. The rash associated with erythema multiforme typically consists of targetoid plaques on the distal extremities. Skin biopsy findings here are also not compatible with erythema multiforme, which would show a vacuolar interface dermatitis with a lymphocytic infiltrate, rather than a neutrophilic vasculitis as pictured.
E. Primary HSV infection – Incorrect. Erythema-nodosum like skin lesions would be highly unusual for primary HSV infection. HSV serologies and PCR were obtained and negative.

### Access to urgent care practices improves understanding and management of endemic coccidioidomycosis: maricopa county, Arizona, 2018–2023 [^111MyBa3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Coccidioidomycosis within endemic regions is often undiagnosed because appropriate testing is not performed. A dashboard was developed to provide information about the prevalence of coccidioidomycosis throughout the year.

Methods

Banner Urgent Care Service has many clinics within Maricopa County, Arizona, a highly endemic region for coccidioidomycosis. All clinic visits and subset analyses for patients with International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes for pneumonia (J18.*) or erythema nodosum (L52) during 2018–2024 were included. Tabulated were daily frequencies of visits, pneumonia and erythema nodosum coding, coccidioidal testing, and test results. Banner Urgent Care Services' counts of monthly coccidioidomycosis diagnoses were compared with those of confirmed coccidioidomycosis cases reported to Maricopa County Department of Public Health.

Results

Monthly frequencies of urgent care coccidioidomycosis diagnoses strongly correlated with public health coccidioidomycosis case counts (r = 0.86). Testing frequency for coccidioidomycosis correlated with overall pneumonia frequency (r = 0.52). The proportion of pneumonia due to coccidioidomycosis varied between < 5% and > 45% within and between years. Coccidioidomycosis was a common cause of erythema nodosum (65%; 95% confidence interval, 45%-67%) and independent of pneumonia. Over half of Banner Urgent Care Services' coccidioidomycosis diagnoses were coded for neither pneumonia nor erythema nodosum.

Conclusion

Data provided by the coccidioidomycosis dashboard can assist urgent care practitioners in knowing when coccidioidomycosis is prevalent in the community. Patients with exposure to endemic coccidioidomycosis who develop erythema nodosum or pneumonia should routinely be tested for coccidioidomycosis. Data from private health care organizations can augment surveillance of diseases important to public health.

### Panniculitis in childhood [^117QUsXH]. Dermatologic Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Panniculitis refers to disorders with inflammation of the subcutaneous fat. Such inflammation can be primary or can be a reaction pattern induced by a systemic process. Some types of panniculitis are seen more commonly or exclusively in children. These include erythema nodosum, subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn, sclerema neonatorum, poststeroid panniculitis, and cold panniculitis. The most typical clinical finding is tender, erythematous subcutaneous nodules. Clinical clues can aid in the diagnosis of the panniculitides, but pathology is often necessary to confirm the diagnosis. In general, the pediatric panniculitides are treated with supportive care and management of any underlying disorders, but certain types such as infectious panniculitis and malignancy-related panniculitis require more specific therapies.

### A female with subcutaneous nodules and livedo racemosa [^114cDy4q]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Which of the following is most commonly associated with this condition?
A. Levamisole
B. Coccidiomycosis
C. Mycobacterium tuberculosis
D. Group A Streptococcus
E. Irritable bowel syndrome

Answers:

A. Levamisole — Incorrect. Levamisole is a common adulterant in cocaine in the United States and can cause a vasculitic or vasculopathic syndrome with acral lesions involving the digits, ears, and nose. It is one of the few conditions that can cause both p- and c-ANCA positivity. Minocycline is a well-known trigger of c-PAN, and drug-induced vasculitis is often associated with p-ANCA positivity.
B. Coccidiomycosis — Incorrect. Coccidiomycosis is associated with erythema nodosum. However, there is no strong association of c-PAN with coccidiomycosis.
C. M tuberculosis — Incorrect. M tuberculosis is an associated trigger of erythema induratum, not c-PAN.
D. Group A Streptococcus — Correct. Group A Streptococcus is the most commonly associated entity, with many patients having a preceding Group A Streptococcus -induced upper respiratory infection. Other upper respiratory infections, such as parvovirus B19, have also been reported to cause c-PAN.
E. Irritable bowel syndrome — Incorrect. c-PAN has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease.

Takayasu's arteritis is a rare, systemic vasculitis with varied presentations across multiple medical specialities. Here, we present a young woman who had recurrent episodes of erythema nodosum on the background of a low-grade fever and no vascular manifestations. The presence of a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate generated a high index of suspicion for underlying vasculitis, and radioimaging confirmed the suspicion of Takayasu's arteritis. The patient was found to have type III diseases in the vasculitic stage and was managed with systemic corticosteroids.

Introduction: Back pain is a relatively common presenting symptom in children and adolescents. Typical causes include spinal deformities (such as scoliosis), spondylolysis, bulging or herniated intervertebral disks, functional pain (such as fibromyalgia), spondylodiscitis, post-traumatic injuries, benign or malignant tumors, osteomyelitis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Erythema nodosum (EN) is the most common panniculitis in childhood. EN lesions are localized at lower limbs in particular on the pretibial region, upper limbs and trunk are rarely involved. EN can be associated with general symptoms such as fever, weakness, sever pain, but skin lesions resolve without skin damage. EN can be associated with infectious diseases (beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, Chlamydia and Mycoplasma Pneumoniae, Epstein-Barr virus, Mycobacterium Tuberculosis), inflammatory bowel diseases, coeliac disease, rheumatologic diseases, malignant tumors.

Objectives: To report the case of a 9-year-old patient with back pain and erythema nodosum. To report the case of a 9-year-old patient with back pain.

Methods: A 9-year-old girl comes to our Department because of back pain and asthenia. Two weeks before the back pain onset the patient got a trauma due to a fall from a swing. Then the patient presented fever (with a temperature up to 38 ° Celsius) for 2–3 days, associated with epistaxis, asthenia and lumbar pain. At first these symptoms were treated with non steroidal antinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Since symptoms got worse she underwent to an orthopedic evaluation that found scoliosis in dorsal and lumbar column and bilateral valgus foot. For the persistence of both back pain and asthenia the patient came to our Department. Our clinical examination revealed: pain in lumbosacral column and on the pressure of the right sacroiliac joint; erythema nodosum on the pretibial region of the left lower limb.

### HLA-DRB1 associations in biopsy proven erythema nodosum [^116EjnxJ]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the HLA-DRB1 associations of patients with erythema nodosum (EN), establish HLA-DRB1 differences among patients with idiopathic and secondary EN, and identify the HLA-DRB1 associations with specific conditions presenting with EN.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study of 100 patients (83 women) with biopsy proven EN diagnosed for a defined population in Northwest Spain. Patients were classified into idiopathic or secondary if skin nodules occurred in the context of a well defined disease, or there was a precipitating event in close temporal relationship with the onset of EN. Patients and controls were HLA-DRB1 genotyped from DNA using molecular based methods.

Results

At the time of diagnosis no precipitating events or underlying diseases were identified in 35 cases and, due to this, they were considered to be idiopathic. Although strong associations do not appear to exist between HLA-DRB1 and unstratified EN, the idiopathic group showed a significantly lower frequency of HLA-DRB1✱04 phenotype compared with controls. Among the patients with secondary EN, the patient subgroup with sarcoidosis exhibited a significantly increased frequency of HLA-DRB1* 13 compared with healthy controls.

Conclusion

Idiopathic and some groups of secondary EN seem to have different HLA-DRB1 associations. These differences may have prognostic value in identifying patients with specific conditions associated with this syndrome.

### Ulceronecrotic rash in an immunocompetent individual [^113m5xqQ]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What condition is most often associated with this diagnosis?
A. Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)
B. Glucagonoma
C. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
D. HIV
E. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)

Answer:

A. EBV – Incorrect. The EBV causes infectious mononucleosis, which manifests as splenomegaly, pharyngitis, and bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy. A morbilliform rash can occur following the administration of an aminopenicillin.
B. Glucagonoma – Incorrect. Glucagon-secreting tumors are associated with NME, which is described above.
C. IBD – Incorrect. IBD can be associated with erythema nodosum (EN) and pyoderma gangrenosum (PG), neither of which is seen here. EN does not ulcerate, and the presentation of PG is notable for ulcers with characteristic undermined edges and surrounding violaceous borders. EN is characterized by a septal granulomatous panniculitis, while established lesions of PG demonstrate ulceration and diffuse neutrophilic infiltrates.
D. HIV – Correct. Malignant syphilis is often associated with HIV infection or immunosuppression. In a systematic review of 45 patients from 2014 to 2018, 75% were HIV-positive. Decreased cell-mediated immunity, defective macrophage function, and a blunted humoral response in immunosuppressed patients enable greater virulence in T pallidum and subsequent severe clinical manifestations. The case presented here is notable in that the patient was healthy, without comorbidities or immunosuppression. All patients diagnosed with syphilis, including malignant syphilis, should be screened for HIV. Additionally, it is recommended that HIV-negative patients with neurosyphilis, ocular syphilis, and otosyphilis are offered HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis, as syphilis is a significant risk factor for HIV infection.
E. SLE – Incorrect. Necrotic findings associated with SLE include antiphospholipid syndrome, which presents with retiform purpura and a thrombotic vasculopathy, and Rowell syndrome or cutaneous lupus with epidermal necrosis.

### Sex-specific manifestations of Löfgren's syndrome [^111RLYKF]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Motivation

It has been debated whether patients need to have erythema nodosum to be classified as having Löfgren's syndrome. In this study, we have therefore in detail evaluated and compared a large number of patients with an acute onset of sarcoidosis and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (BHL), with or without erythema nodosum (EN). This study is important because it may lead to a more accurate definition of Löfgren's syndrome, and an exact phenotype of patients is crucial in modern medical research.

Background

Löfgren's syndrome is commonly regarded as a distinct clinical entity.

Methods

We have in detail evaluated a large group of patients (n = 150) with an acute onset of sarcoidosis with BHL, in most cases with fever, EN, and/or bilateral ankle arthritis or periarticular inflammation. Within this group, 87 patients had EN (EN positive), whereas 63 were without EN (EN negative), though with distinct symmetric ankle inflammation.

Results

EN-positive and EN-negative patients were identical in every aspect except that there were significantly more women in the EN-positive group: 58 women (67%) in the EN-positive group compared with only 17 (27%) women in the EN-negative group (p < 0.0001). In all other aspects, such as age, smoking habits, seasonal clustering of disease onset, rate of positive biopsies, chest radiography, pulmonary function, bronchoalveolar lavage cell distributions including the typically increased CD4/CD8 ratio, and clinical development of the disease, the EN-positive and EN-negative groups were close to identical. The two groups were also identically strongly associated with HLA-DRB1✱0301/DQB1✱0201, with 60 (69.0%) and 44 (69.8%) patients having this particular HLA type in the EN-positive and EN-negative groups, respectively. Such patients recovered to the same degree-that is, at almost 100%.

Conclusions

We conclude that manifestations of Löfgren's syndrome differ between men and women, with EN found predominantly in women, whereas a marked periarticular inflammation of the ankles or ankle arthritis without EN is seen preferentially in men.

### The causal relationship between inflammatory bowel diseases and erythema nodosum: a bidirectional two-sample mendelian randomization study [^115tpwHF]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Causal effects of EN on IBD and its main subtypes

In the reverse stage, we used EN as exposure data to investigate the causal connection between EN and the danger of IBD and its subtypes. Researchers found no causal association of EN on IBD (OR = 0.970, 95% CI: 0.910 − 1.033, p = 0.341, Fig. 4 A) and CD (OR = 1.026, 95% CI: 0.951 − 1.107, p = 0.502, Fig. 4 B) by employing the IVW approach. The results of several additional complementary methods also support this conclusion (Fig. 5). Nonetheless, the IVW technique implied that EN may lower the risk of UC (OR = 0.927, 95% CI: 0.861 − 0.997, p = 0.041, Fig. 4 C). The MR-PRESSO analyses corroborated the IVW method's findings, but not MR-Egger regression, weighted median, and weighted mode (Fig. 5). Neither significant heterogeneity nor horizontal pleiotropy were shown by sensitivity analyses (Supplementary Table 9). Furthermore, the causative effect of EN on IBD and its subtypes did not significantly change with any individual SNP during the "leave-one-out" analysis (Supplementary Fig. 4). Scatter plots, forest plots, and funnel plots were shown in Supplementary Figs. 5–6.

### The association between erythema nodosum and pyoderma gangrenosum and pediatric inflammatory bowel disease [^116zgY6k]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The objectives of this study is to estimate rates and identify factors associated with erythema nodosum (EN) and pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

Methods

This cohort study examined longitudinal visits of patients aged ≤ 21 years from the ImproveCareNow (ICN) registry. We evaluated the association of factors at the patient-level (demographics and IBD diagnosis age) and visit-level (IBD severity scores, markers and phenotypes, comorbidities, and treatment) with the presence of EN and PG, using longitudinal logistic regression models adjusted for time and within-patient clustering.

Results

A total of 285,913 visits from 32,497 patients aged ≤ 21 years from the ICN registry were analyzed. The occurrence of EN was 1.57% (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.43%-1.71%) and the occurrence of PG was 0.90% (95% CI: 0.80%-1.00%). Co-occurrence of EN and PG was reported in 0.30% (95% CI: 0.25%-0.37%) patients. Both EN and PG were associated (p < 0.0001) with worse intestinal disease, lower remission, higher inflammatory markers, and extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) arthritis and uveitis.

Conclusions

EN and PG were associated with increased disease severity and other noncutaneous EIMs (arthritis and uveitis). A small subset of patients had developed both EN and PG.

### The causal relationship between inflammatory bowel diseases and erythema nodosum: a bidirectional two-sample mendelian randomization study [^112vwXkK]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) exhibit a heightened likelihood of developing erythema nodosum (EN), but the presence of causal link is unknown. The purpose of the present research was to investigate this connection using a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis.

Methods

Summarized statistics for EN were sourced from the FinnGen consortium of European ancestry. The International Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetic Consortium (IBDGC) was used to extract summary data for IBD. The inverse variance weighted (IVW) technique was the major method used to determine the causative link between them.

Results

The study evaluated the reciprocal causal link between IBD and EN. The IVW technique confirmed a positive causal link between IBD and EN (OR = 1.237, 95% CI: 1.109–1.37, p = 1.43 × 10 − 8), as well as a strong causality connection between Crohn's disease (CD) and EN (OR = 1.248, 95% CI: 1.156–1.348, p = 1.00 × 10 − 4). Nevertheless, a causal connection between ulcerative colitis (UC) and EN could not be established by the data. The reverse MR research findings indicated that analysis indicated that an increase in EN risks decreased the likelihood of UC (OR = 0.927, 95% CI: 0.861–0.997, p = 0.041), but the causal association of EN to IBD and CD could not be established.

Conclusion

This investigation confirmed that IBD and CD had a causal connection with EN, whereas UC did not. In addition, EN may decrease the likelihood of UC. Further study must be performed to uncover the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms producing that connection.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^1116rfu5]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) management and antiretroviral therapy (ART) use — Adults and adolescents with HIV: ART should not be withheld because of concerns for possible development of IRIS (AIII). Patients with paradoxical IRIS typically present with inflammatory manifestations that include erythematous or immunological skin lesions such as erythema nodosum, large and painful peripheral lymph nodes, and synovitis of small joints. Most symptoms can be managed by judicious use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and corticosteroids are reserved for synovitis that interferes with daily function. Although the IRIS events in the IVAP trial were managed effectively with continuation of ART and antifungal therapy, they were associated with higher morbidity, lower quality of life, increased diagnostic testing, duration of hospitalization, and cost.

### Panniculitis with fever of unknown origin [^1166zKwc]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

Based on aetiology, panniculitis is a relatively rare process in children and is among many diseases that cause panniculitis. Other forms of childhood panniculitis include, poststeroidal panniculitis, neonatal scleroderma, cold panniculitis, newborn subcutaneous fat necrosis among others. There are very few reports of panniculitis in children that are well described in adults. The most common type is erythema nodosum, a septal panniculitis without vasculitis, which is clinically defined as the appearance of painful and inflammatory cutaneous nodules that primarily affect the pretibial region of the lower limbs. These nodules typically resolve on their own in 1–6 weeks without ulceration or cutaneous atrophy. It is a pluriaetiological condition that usually develops because of a hypersensitivity response linked to paediatric enteric, tuberculosis or streptococcal infections, as well as beta-lactam and macrolide use. The patient in this instance had subcutaneous nodules, a fever and systemic symptoms, all of which were clinical signs of panniculitis and called for a thorough diagnostic evaluation. Clinically, panniculitis manifests as deep plaques or nodules, irrespective of the aetiology. To arrive at an accurate diagnosis, it is thus important to supplement its investigation with a histological study. Nevertheless, given the restricted capacity of adipose tissue to respond with various patterns, its histology is not easily interpreted. It is the physician's responsibility to decide when to do a skin biopsy, which is the most effective diagnostic tool. It is important to perform the biopsy early on to prevent the lesion from evolving into one with less specific histological changes.

### Painful nodules on the lower legs [^114xkAR2]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Answers:

A. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency panniculitis – Incorrect. This is a manifestation of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, which is an autosomal codominant condition that primarily affects the lungs and liver. Histologically, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency panniculitis is characterized by liquefactive necrosis of the dermis and subcutaneous septa, which is inconsistent with the histology in this case.
B. Lupus panniculitis – Incorrect. Lupus panniculitis is a form of chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Ten percent of lupus panniculitis patients have signs of systemic lupus erythematosus. The histology is incorrect for lupus panniculitis. Histologic findings of lupus panniculitis are characterized by hyaline necrosis and lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates.
C. Pancreatic panniculitis – Correct. Pancreatic panniculitis is a rare cutaneous manifestation of pancreatic disease characterized by painful, erythematous, subcutaneous nodules that can ulcerate and produce an oily substance. In this case, the patient had imaging findings and labs consistent with acute pancreatitis.
D. Poststeroid panniculitis – Incorrect. This occurs within 10 days of rapid tapering or withdrawal of systemic corticosteroid therapy, neither of which the patient experienced.
E. Erythema nodosum – Incorrect. This is one of the most common forms of panniculitis, most often idiopathic in nature, but can also be caused by sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel disease, drugs, and infectious etiologies, such as streptococcal infection. The histology is incorrect for erythema nodosum, which is characterized by septal panniculitis.

Regarding the two primary subtypes, there was a causal relationship discovered between CD and EN (OR = 0.927, 95% CI: 0.861–0.997, p = 0.041, Fig. 2 B). The Bonferroni correction test confirmed the causal effect of CD on EN. The results of additional complimentary techniques, in addition to MR-PRESSO, validated the IVW method's findings (Fig. 3). Sensitivity analyses indicated a lack of significant heterogeneity or horizontal pleiotropy effects in the causal estimates (Supplementary Table 7). The leave-one-out studies confirmed that none of the individual IVs singularly accounted for outcomes (Supplementary Fig. 1B).

However, no causality between UC and EN was identified (OR = 1.104, 95% CI: 0.995 − 1.224, p = 0.062, Fig. 2 C) and the outcomes of the MR-Egger, MR-PRESSO, Weighted Mode, and Weighted Median analyses agreed with the IVW technique results (Fig. 3). Cochran's Q statistics, MR-Egger regression, and MR-PRESSO analysis did not show horizontal pleiotropy or heterogeneity in either subgroup of analyses (Supplementary Table 9). A leave-one-out analysis was performed to further validate the results' stability and robustness (Supplementary Fig. 1C). Supplementary Figs. 2–3 show the forest plots and funnel plots of SNPs linked with IBD (CD and UC) and EN.

### Management of cutaneous disorders related to inflammatory bowel disease [^111bkZvi]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Generally, drug-induced side effects disappear on removing the drug, although sometimes specific treatment or no treatment at all is required. For example, to prevent the appearance of skin rash with infliximab, premedication with corticosteroids and antihistamines is recommended. When rash appears, the extent and, especially, the accompanying symptoms, will indicate the need to stop infliximab or not.

Anti-TNF agents have also been reported to induce the appearance of psoriasis or exacerbate a pre-existing disease, even though they are part of the treatment armamentarium for that same disorder. Wollina et al studied patients with rheumatoid arthritis, IBD, psoriasis, etc, who had pustular lesions during TNF-α inhibitor treatment. He observed that they most frequently had psoriasis which disappeared after removing the drug, sometimes by changing to a different anti-TNF, and occasionally just with topical treatment, but that other times cessation of the drug only achieved stabilization of the disease.

Some mild skin reactions such as local reddening of the skin at the injection site of methotrexate or adalimumab, do not require treatment. Other side effects like erythema multiforme, erythema nodosum etc, require specific treatment, in addition to removing the responsible drug, as is done in drug-unrelated cases. Case reports of specific drug desensitization have been described. Akahoshi et al reported the successful desensitization of a sulfasalazine-induced skin rash in a patient with UC.

In conclusion, dermatologic lesions are frequent in IBD patients, who should be examined for cutaneous alterations upon presentation and during the course of the diseas e, not only because of the large variety of associated skin disorders, but also because of the different type of medications that are used in the IBD treatment. The long-term toxicity and carcinogenicity of immunomodulators and biologic agents are still being investigated. The etiology of cutaneous disorders associated to IBD is quite diverse and, therefore, treatment should be individualized and directed to treating the underlying IBD as well as the specific dermatologic condition.

The intention of this review has been to offer the therapeutic recommendations for IBD-related skin disorders that are present in the literature. However, in the absence of prospective and randomized studies, treatment should always be individualized and include the multidisciplinary focus of both the Dermatologist and Gastroenterologist.

### Two cases of treatment-resistant erythema nodosum responding favorably to infliximab in the absence of gastrointestinal disease [^113yLpby]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

These favorable outcomes suggest that TNF-α inhibition may offer a valuable therapeutic option for managing EN outside of the setting of IBD, particularly in treatment-resistant cases. While paradoxical induction of EN has been reported, these instances have occurred exclusively in the setting of other systemic inflammatory conditions such as IBD, ankylosing spondylitis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Although further prospective studies are warranted, our findings support intravenous infliximab as a promising therapy for recalcitrant idiopathic EN.

### Erythema nodosum induced by the synergism of acupuncture therapy and flu-like infection [^116MUdJr]. The Journal of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

A 32-year-old female patient developed erythema nodosum-like lesions at needle prick sites after acupuncture therapy. Over the next few days, she developed similar new lesions over the extremities, trunk and face along with flu-like symptoms. There were neither genital ulcerations nor eye lesions. A skin biopsy specimen from an extremity lesion showed the characteristic findings of erythema nodosum. Treatment with oral potassium iodide at a dose of 750 mg/day was effective, and there has not been any recurrence to date. We diagnosed this case as erythema nodosum induced by a synergism between acupuncture therapy and a flu-like infection.

Materials and methods

Study design

For the MR investigation, several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were chosen as instrumental variables (IVs). Three key presumptions form the foundation of the MR method (Fig. 1). First, IVs should be strongly connected to the exposures. Second, confounders should not be associated with IVs. Third, rather than via other routes, IVs should impact outcome risk by exposures. The present MR analysis was built on summary data from ethically approved published studies, no additional approval is needed.

Data sources

The FinnGen Consortium provided summary statistics of EN, comprising 904 cases and 398,204 controls. EN was diagnosed using the ICD-10 (International Classification of diseases) criteria. The summary data of IBD were from the International Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics Consortium (IIBDGC) and contained 12,882 IBD cases and 21,770 controls, 6,968 UC cases and 20,464 controls, and 5,956 CD cases and 14,927 controls. IBD and its subgroups were diagnosed using established endoscopic, histological, and radiological criteria. There were no overlapped populations between the exposures and the results.

Selection of instrumental variables

A variety of inspection methods were applied for the screening of qualified IVs. IVs for IBD (CD or UC) were screened at a genome-wide significance level (p < 5 × 10 − 8). Furthermore, we established p < 5 × 10 − 6 as the screening requirement for IVs in EN. To guarantee the independence of SNPs for IBD, the SNPs with linkage disequilibrium (LD) value (r2 > 0.001) were removed. SNPs having a F value (F = β²/SE) greater than 10 were selected to reduce instrument bias. Then, selected SNPs linked to confounding factors were deleted by scanning PhenoScannerV2 for potential associations, such as smoking, celiac disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Both exposure and result data were harmonized to make sure that each IV had been matched to the same effect alleles. Moreover, outlier SNPs were removed based on MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) analysis to achieve a consistent outcome.

### Erythema nodosum leprosum after allergen immunotherapy as initial presentation of lepromatous leprosy treated with novel multidrug regimen [^116vW76T]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Although < 5% of the world's population is seemingly susceptible to Mycobacterium leprae infection, host genetics and environmental factors, including immunodeficient or immunosuppressed states, predispose toward the severe disease spectral state of the lepromatous (multibacillary) leprosy. We present a case of a patient undergoing allergen immunotherapy, who suddenly developed erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) as the initial manifestation of lepromatous leprosy (LL) and was treated with a novel monthly multidrug antibiotic regimen in combination with immunomodulatory therapy. This is a rare case report of a difficult-to-treat leprosy immune reaction that developed after a preceding immunologic event of allergen immunotherapy.

### Symptoms in blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, and histoplasmosis versus other respiratory illnesses in commercially insured adult outpatients-United States, 2016–2017 [^115AD8Bk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, and histoplasmosis cause various symptoms and syndromes, which may present similarly to other infections such as bacterial or viral community-acquired pneumonia, influenza, and tuberculosis.

Methods

We used the IBM MarketScan Research Databases to identify adult outpatients with International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), diagnosis codes during 2016–2017 for blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, pneumonia (viral, bacterial, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and unspecified pneumonia), influenza; tuberculosis, and other lower and upper respiratory infections. We compared symptoms on and in the 90 days before diagnosis between patients with these diagnosis codes.

Results

Fever was less common in blastomycosis (2.6%), histoplasmosis (5.3%), and coccidioidomycosis (9.4%) than in patients with influenza (18.5%) or pneumonia (12.6–16.3%). Fungal diseases resembled bacterial, viral, and unspecified pneumonias for many pulmonary symptoms. However, cough was more common with coccidioidomycosis (31.4%) and less common with histoplasmosis (14.0%) and blastomycosis (13.1%) versus influenza (20.2%). Although less frequent, solitary pulmonary nodule (5.2–14.4%), enlarged lymph nodes (3.7–9.0%), hyperhidrosis (< 2%), and erythema nodosum (< 2%) were particularly suggestive of fungal diseases.

Conclusions

Despite limitations inherent in administrative coding, this analysis of symptom codes across disease types suggests that fungal diseases may be difficult to clinically distinguish from other causes of pneumonia except when certain uncommon symptoms are present. Healthcare providers caring for patients with pneumonia, especially if nonresponsive to conventional treatment, should consider fungal diseases as possible etiologies.

### Fever and indurated subcutaneous plaques [^1162SBxX]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Lupus profundus
B. Subcutaneous panniculitislike T-cell lymphoma (SPTCL)
C. Erythema nodosum
D. Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN)
E. Erythema induratum
Answers:
A. Lupus profundus – Incorrect. Lupus profundus is more common in women and presents as subcutaneous nodules on arms, shoulders, buttocks, and face. It occurs in 2% to 5% of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. Conversely, 10% to 15% of patients with lupus panniculitis have SLE. Histopathology findings show lobular lymphocytic panniculitis with epidermal and dermal changes of lupus, such as thickened basement membrane, interface changes, and superficial and deep, perivascular, periadnexal, lymphocytic inflammation with increased dermal mucin. In less than half of the cases, biopsy findings show lobular lymphocytic panniculitis without epidermal and dermal lupus changes. There are increased plasma cells and B-cell aggregates, and are less likely to have Ki-67/MIB-1–positive T cells or monoclonal TCR gene rearrangement compared with SPTCL.
B. SPTCL – Correct. The infiltration of fat lobules by large lymphocytes with hyperchromatic irregular nuclei rimming the adipocytes with fat necrosis is consistent with a diagnosis of SPTCL. The World Health Organization criteria classify SPTCL to cases expressing αβ T-cell receptor, commonly CD8 +, with solely subcutis involvement, which often runs an indolent course. Primary cutaneous γδ T-cell lymphoma is commonly CD4 −, CD8 -, CD56 +, with infiltration into epidermis and dermis and portends a poor prognosis. Approximately 19% of SPTCL patients also have autoimmune disorders including SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjögren disease.
C. Erythema nodosum – Incorrect. There are tender erythematous subcutaneous nodules on the lower legs.
D. PAN – Incorrect. Livedo reticularis, Raynaud phenomenon, subcutaneous nodules, and ulceration often occur on legs.
E. Erythema induratum – Incorrect. It presents with tender nodules on calves, which may ulcerate, with septal and lobular granulomatous panniculitis and neutrophilic vasculitis on histology.

### Erythema nodosum-like panniculitis associated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: two cases reporting a rare cutaneous adverse event [^112QBV9g]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

ICPis enhance the immune system's antitumor activity but may also cause immune-related adverse events, of which dermatologic toxicities are among the most common ones. Dermatologic immune-related adverse events may manifest as vitiligo-like leukoderma and various inflammatory eruptions, including lichenoid, eczematous, immunobullous, exanthematous, psoriasiform, and granulomatous patterns, and, although uncommonly, severe cutaneous adverse reactions. To the best of our knowledge, only a few other cases of panniculitis associated with ICPis have been reported in the literature.,

EN-like panniculitis associated with ICPis clinically resembles EN with erythematous plaques favoring the anterior aspects of the lower extremities as seen in this report, consistent with other cases in the literature. Interestingly, 1 patient with ocular melanoma developed EN-like panniculitis while receiving nivolumab and later developed a sarcoidosis-like syndrome. Additionally, 2 other patients with ovarian cancer and melanoma developed EN-like panniculitis without sarcoidosis-like syndrome, mimicking disease recurrence while being treated with ipilimumab and nivolumab. Two additional cases of granulomatous lobular panniculitis have been reported in melanoma patients receiving ICPi therapy, 1 of whom had systemic symptoms, including fever and oligoarthritis, which resolved with systemic corticosteroid therapy. EN-like panniculitis may flare on ICPi rechallenge as seen in case 2, but several reported cases demonstrated clinical resolution without recurrence when immunotherapy was recommenced.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Pediatric tuberculosis — extra-thoracic manifestations in HIV-infected children: Approximately 25% of children with TB have extra-thoracic involvement, with disseminated forms more common in HIV-infected children. Peripheral lymphadenitis may show a matted mass of lymph nodes > 2x2 cm, and axillary adenitis ipsilateral to bacille calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccination is suggestive of BCG adenitis. TBM is most common in children aged < 3 years but, especially with HIV coinfection, can occur at any age. Additional patterns include vertebral osteo-articular disease with typical TB gibbus formation with/without para-vertebral abscess, cold abscesses often in association with bone or deep muscle (psoas) involvement, and hypersensitivity reactions such as erythema nodosum and phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis.

### Exploring the combination of SSKI and topical heparin in a case of erythema nodosum migrans [^114zPixg]. Dermatologic Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Erythema nodosum migrans (subacute nodular migratory panniculitis) is an uncommon type of panniculitis characterized by migrating subcutaneous nodules or plaque on the lower extremity. There are a very few cases of Erythema nodosum migrans reported and thus its appropriate treatment modality is not defined. We describe a case of a 30-year-old male with idiopathic erythema nodosum migrans which was manifest centrifugally spreading, slightly morpheaform erythematous plaque on the lower left leg. The patient was diagnosed initially and treated as a case of furunculosis with poor clinical response. The skin biopsy showed features consistent with subacute nodular panniculitis. Saturated Solution of Potassium Iodide along with topical Heparin successfully treated the patient, when the conventional treatment modalities failed. In a morpheaform centrifugally expanded plaque, erythema nodosum migrans should be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis, especially in the lower extremities in cases of unknown etiology.

### Diagnosis… [^116sQWEt]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

ERYTHEMA NODOSUM Erythema nodosum is the most common nonspecific cutaneous lesion of sarcoidosis. 4 It represents a hypersensitivity reaction to a number of possible stimuli, including medications, infections, and inflammatory diseases. Erythema nodosum usually manifests as extremely tender, subcutaneous erythematous nodules, often on the anterior tibia. Onset of the condition may be sudden, accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fever, malaise, and polyarthralgias. Lofgren's syndrome refers to the constellation of erythema nodosum, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and polyarthralgias, which represents an acute presentation of systemic sarcoidosis. 1 Biopsy of erythema nodosum reveals panniculitis with septal inflammation. The most common types of specific lesions are papules. 3 They commonly occur on the face but may occur anywhere on the body. While only a few papules may be noted, multiple scattered or confluent lesions are more common.

Papules of sarcoidosis may be of various colors, including red, reddish-brown, violaceous, translucent, or hyperpigmented. Most exhibit little surface change and are indurated on palpation. Lupus pernio is one of the few cutaneous manifestations that are characteristic of sarcoidosis. Lesions are chronic, indurated papules or plaques that affect the mid-face, particularly the alar rim of the nose. Even a few small papules in this location may be associated with granulomatous infiltration of the nasal mucosa and upper respiratory tract, resulting in masses, ulcerations, or even life-threatening airway obstruction.
5. 4 Clinically, the lesions are papular and may be mistaken for keloids. Multiple other cutaneous morphologies are possible; many are quite rare, although the incidence is difficult to determine. 6 Sarcoidosis of the scalp may result in scarring or nonscarring alopecia.

7 Ulcerative sarcoidosis can lead to ulcerated lesions of sarcoidosis or may even develop in de novo lower leg ulcers. 8 Other unusual manifestations include hypopigmented patches, 6 ichthyosis of the lower legs, 9 subcutaneous nodules, and erythroderma.

### Clinical characteristics of erythema nodosum and associations with chronicity and recurrence… [^116C7LDB]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Erythema nodosum, the most common panniculitis, classically presents as erythematous nodules in the bilateral pretibial areas. Literature characterizing EN is scarce — restricted to small cohorts outside of the US, with fewer data examining chronicity/recurrence. 1–5 In this retrospective cohort study, we characterize the presentation, causes, treatment, and disease course of EN, and identify associations with chronicity/recurrence. Patients with diagnoses of other panniculitides were excluded. Data were extracted on demographics, presentation, workup, triggers, comorbidities, treatments, and response. Patients were classified as having classic EN if symptoms resolved within 12 weeks and chronic/recurrent EN if symptoms persisted/recurred 12 weeks or longer following initial onset.

Patients with chronic/recurrent EN compared with classic EN underwent more extensive evaluation for underlying causes, including autoantibodies and colonoscopy/endoscopy. Underlying disease associations or triggers were identified in 256 patients, with no difference between groups. Patients with chronic/recurrent EN compared with classic EN more frequently required multiple therapies to achieve a clinical response, and nonsteroidal immunomodulatory therapies, intralesional or topical corticosteroids, and potassium iodide were used more frequently to treat chronic/recurrent EN. Systemic therapy was required in 64% of patients with chronic/recurrent EN vs 48% in patients with classic EN, and incomplete therapeutic response occurred in 26% and 1%, respectively.

To our knowledge, this cohort study is the largest to examine clinical characteristics of EN and the only US-based study examining chronicity/recurrence. This study highlights this topic's importance, as nearly half of all patients exhibited chronic/recurrent EN. Moreover, 26% of patients with chronic/recurrent EN demonstrated incomplete response to therapy despite EN's typical characterization as a self-resolving process. 4 Importantly, only 25% of cases in both groups were idiopathic, suggesting that evaluation for underlying triggers or comorbidities should be considered in all patients with EN, regardless of subtype.
