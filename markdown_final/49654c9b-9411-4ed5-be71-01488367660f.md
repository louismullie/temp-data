## Question

How is lactate dehydrogenase clinically relevant in a patient who presents with pancreatitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is clinically relevant in acute pancreatitis, including diagnostics, prognostication, limitations, and practical use. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what LDH measures and its intrinsic specificity. Then, I should confirm whether LDH is part of standard diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis. Next, I will evaluate LDH's prognostic role within validated severity scoring systems and contemporary evidence. After that, I need to place LDH within current guideline-endorsed risk stratification frameworks. I should also consider the pitfalls and confounders that can mislead interpretation. Finally, I will synthesize a practical bedside approach and close with the bottom-line clinical relevance, making sure each point is anchored to high-credibility guidance where possible [^113qSTBZ] [^111wfzKF] [^1155pwXc].

> Let me first confirm what LDH actually reflects and whether it helps me diagnose acute pancreatitis; LDH is a ubiquitous cytosolic enzyme released with cellular injury across many tissues, which makes it highly nonspecific as a standalone biomarker of pancreatic inflammation, so I need to be cautious about overinterpreting it in isolation [^113qSTBZ] [^11554ccX]. Hold on, I should verify whether LDH is included in diagnostic criteria; the American College of Gastroenterology 2024 guideline diagnosis requires any two of three: typical epigastric pain, serum amylase or lipase > 3× ULN, and characteristic imaging, and notably LDH is not part of this triad, so LDH plays no role in establishing the diagnosis itself [^111wfzKF]. Let me also keep in mind that classification systems such as the Revised Atlanta definition and determinant-based frameworks are used after diagnosis to stage severity and do not require LDH to confirm the disease, reinforcing its non-diagnostic status [^111wfLbS] [^1178xaaf].

> Next, I should review LDH's role in prognostication; historically and in some contemporary work, LDH contributes to early severity assessment rather than diagnosis, so I will examine validated scores and newer models that include it [^114pBMrn] [^115yKEXs]. Wait, let me verify the specific tools; the Glasgow-Imrie score explicitly includes LDH among eight variables assessed within 48 hours, where a total score ≥ 3 predicts severe disease and higher complication risk, confirming LDH's established prognostic usage in that context [^114pBMrn]. I also need to check simpler models; the BALI model uses LDH ≥ 300 IU/L at admission along with BUN, age, and IL-6 and performs comparably to Glasgow and APACHE II for mortality risk, which supports LDH's utility as one component of a parsimonious early risk tool [^115yKEXs]. Let me consider evolving complications; a 2023 derivation of a necrosis prediction score (NDS-48) identified 48-hour LDH alongside WBC, hematocrit, and CRP as independent predictors of progression to necrotizing pancreatitis, suggesting LDH may signal evolving local complications when measured in the early course, albeit from a lower-credibility source that requires external validation [^114XKkBS]. I should also recall older small studies where LDH, in combination with other acute-phase markers such as procalcitonin and calcium, showed prognostic signals for severe attacks, but these data are limited and best used as supportive evidence rather than definitive guidance [^115Uf6cb].

> Now, I need to place LDH within current guideline-endorsed risk stratification; modern practice generally emphasizes parameters other than LDH, so I must be careful not to overweigh LDH outside of scores that explicitly include it [^1155pwXc]. I should double-check what major guidelines prioritize; ACG 2024 highlights BUN, hematocrit, obesity, SIRS, and comorbidities as key risk factors for severe disease, and does not list LDH among the principal early predictors, which signals a shift away from LDH in routine severity assessment pathways [^1155pwXc]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost conflated BISAP variables with Glasgow; let me correct that to avoid confusion, because the BISAP score uses BUN and not LDH, and APACHE II relies on different physiologic variables, so neither contemporary, widely recommended tool requires LDH for calculation or accuracy in general use [^115d2Swf] [^116mXfA9]. I should confirm inflammation markers endorsed for timing; CRP at 48–72 hours (≥ 150 mg/L) is recognized as a useful prognostic factor for severe disease, again underscoring that LDH is not necessary for mainstream early risk assessment or monitoring in most patients [^113wAAUU] [^116jZKQF].

> I will now examine the major limitations and confounders; because LDH is so nonspecific, I need to ensure I do not misattribute an LDH rise to pancreatic severity when other etiologies are likely, especially in multisystem illness [^113qSTBZ]. Hold on, I should verify the breadth of differential; increases in LDH occur with hemolysis, hepatic injury, myocardial and skeletal muscle injury, pulmonary embolism, renal infarction, malignancies, shock states, and indeed many infections, and common medications can raise LDH, so a pancreatitis patient with organ dysfunction or polypharmacy may have elevated LDH for reasons unrelated to pancreatic necrosis or severity, which can easily mislead if taken out of context [^113qSTBZ]. Let me reconsider whether routine ordering helps; given this nonspecificity and low marginal management impact, some have argued LDH should be retired from routine order sets and used selectively, which should temper any inclination to trend LDH outside a defined prognostic score or a specific alternative-diagnosis workup [^11554ccX].

> Next, I should synthesize a practical approach that aligns with guidelines; first, during diagnosis, I need to ignore LDH and focus on two-of-three criteria with pain, enzymes, and imaging as recommended by ACG 2024, reserving LDH for later contextual use if at all [^111wfzKF]. Then, within the first 24–48 hours, I should calculate a guideline-endorsed severity score such as BISAP or APACHE II, examine SIRS, and track BUN and hematocrit because these are strongly associated with severe outcomes and are specifically prioritized by high-credibility guidance, whereas LDH is not necessary for this step unless I am using Glasgow-Imrie or a local protocol that explicitly incorporates LDH [^1155pwXc] [^115d2Swf] [^116mXfA9]. Let me verify the monitoring window; trending CRP around day 3 and reassessing BUN and clinical status are recommended, while serial LDH adds uncertain value and should not independently drive escalation without corroborating clinical or laboratory evidence, which aligns with the broader guidance to rely on more specific markers and clinical trajectory instead of nonspecific enzymes like LDH [^113wAAUU] [^116jZKQF]. But wait, what if LDH is markedly high at admission; in that case, I can include it in Glasgow-Imrie or BALI where appropriate, yet I should simultaneously search for non-pancreatic causes of elevated LDH so I do not overestimate pancreatic severity based solely on this nonspecific marker [^114pBMrn] [^115yKEXs] [^113qSTBZ].

> Finally, I should conclude with the bottom-line interpretation; LDH is not a diagnostic test for acute pancreatitis and it is absent from modern diagnostic criteria, but it retains a conditional prognostic role as one element in selected severity scores such as Glasgow-Imrie and BALI, and it may flag evolving complications in early observational work, though its nonspecificity and the availability of better-validated predictors have markedly reduced its centrality in current practice [^111wfzKF] [^114pBMrn] [^115yKEXs]. I need to ensure that whenever LDH is considered, it is interpreted within a validated scoring framework or as a nonspecific indicator of tissue injury, and that my management decisions are anchored to guideline-endorsed parameters like BUN, SIRS, hematocrit trends, and CRP rather than LDH alone, which aligns with contemporary ACG and WSES guidance and minimizes the risk of misattribution and overtreatment [^1155pwXc] [^113wAAUU] [^116jZKQF] [^11554ccX].

Elevated LDH in pancreatitis reflects **tissue injury and necrosis** and is a **nonspecific marker** of disease severity [^116E5z8K] [^113qSTBZ]. LDH is included in the **Glasgow-Imrie score** [^114pBMrn] and is associated with higher risk of severe disease, organ failure, and mortality, but it is **not specific to pancreatitis** [^113qSTBZ] and should be interpreted with other clinical and laboratory data. LDH is **not part of the diagnostic criteria** for acute pancreatitis [^111wfzKF] and is not recommended for routine monitoring; its main value is in **early risk stratification** [^115d2Swf] and identifying patients who may need intensive care or intervention [^1178xaaf].

---

## Pathophysiological basis of LDH elevation in pancreatitis

LDH is a cytoplasmic enzyme present in most tissues, including the pancreas, and is released into the bloodstream with cellular injury or necrosis [^116E5z8K]. In acute pancreatitis, **pancreatic acinar cell injury and necrosis** release LDH into the circulation [^1112MVtk]. Elevated LDH levels therefore reflect the extent of pancreatic tissue damage and necrosis, which are hallmarks of severe acute pancreatitis [^11431Lov].

---

## Clinical significance of LDH in pancreatitis

### Diagnostic utility

LDH elevation is **nonspecific** [^113qSTBZ] and can occur in various conditions, including pancreatitis, liver disease, hemolysis, malignancies, and infections. It is **not part of the diagnostic criteria** for acute pancreatitis [^111wfzKF], which rely on clinical presentation, elevated pancreatic enzymes (amylase or lipase), and imaging findings.

---

### Prognostic utility

- **Severity assessment**: Elevated LDH levels are associated with increased severity of pancreatitis, including higher risk of pancreatic necrosis, organ failure, and mortality.

- **Glasgow-Imrie score**: LDH is a component of the Glasgow-Imrie scoring system, which predicts severe acute pancreatitis. An LDH level > 600 IU/L within 48 hours of admission is considered a significant predictor of severe disease.

- **Organ failure prediction**: Elevated LDH levels correlate with the development of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and persistent organ failure, all of which are associated with poor outcomes in pancreatitis.

---

### Monitoring disease progression

LDH is **not routinely used** to monitor disease progression or response to therapy in pancreatitis because of its nonspecific nature. Serial measurements may provide **adjunctive information** regarding ongoing tissue injury or necrosis, but they should not be relied upon solely for clinical decision-making.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the use of **established scoring systems** (e.g. BISAP, APACHE II, Glasgow-Imrie) [^115d2Swf] and specific laboratory markers (e.g. CRP, procalcitonin, BUN, hematocrit) [^113wAAUU] for risk stratification and management of acute pancreatitis [^1155pwXc]. LDH is included in the **Glasgow-Imrie score** but is not highlighted as a standalone marker in recent guidelines.

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

- **Nonspecificity**: LDH elevation is nonspecific [^113qSTBZ] and can be influenced by various conditions unrelated to pancreatitis, such as hemolysis, liver disease, malignancies, and infections [^11554ccX].

- **Assay variability**: Variability in laboratory assays and lack of standardized cut-off values may limit the clinical utility of LDH measurements [^11554ccX].

- **Limited predictive accuracy**: LDH alone has limited predictive accuracy for severe pancreatitis and should be interpreted in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory parameters [^11431Lov].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

- **Early risk stratification**: Elevated LDH levels on admission may prompt early aggressive management, including intensive monitoring, fluid resuscitation, and consideration of ICU admission [^115yKEXs].

- **Adjunctive marker**: LDH can be used as an adjunctive marker to identify patients at higher risk of severe disease, pancreatic necrosis, and organ failure [^114pBMrn].

- **Not for routine monitoring**: LDH is not recommended for routine monitoring of disease progression or response to therapy due to its nonspecific nature.

---

Elevated LDH in pancreatitis reflects tissue injury and necrosis, serving as a **nonspecific marker of disease severity**. It is included in the Glasgow-Imrie score [^114pBMrn] and is associated with increased risk of severe disease, organ failure, and mortality. However, LDH is not specific to pancreatitis and should be interpreted alongside other clinical and laboratory findings. Its primary clinical utility lies in early risk stratification [^115d2Swf] and identifying patients who may require intensive monitoring and intervention [^1155pwXc].

### Comparison of existing clinical scoring systems to predict persistent organ failure in patients with acute pancreatitis [^114pBMrn]. Gastroenterology (2012). High credibility.

The Glasgow-Imrie Criteria, also known as the Imrie Scoring System or Glasgow Score, is a clinical calculator used to assess the severity of acute pancreatitis, including in the context of procedures like endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. This scoring system is applicable to patients diagnosed with acute pancreatitis and aids in predicting the prognosis and potential complications of the disease.

The Glasgow-Imrie Criteria evaluates eight parameters within 48 hours of admission. These parameters include age, white blood cell count, blood glucose, serum lactate dehydrogenase, serum aspartate transaminase, blood urea nitrogen, arterial partial pressure of oxygen, and albumin. Each parameter is scored as 0 or 1. A total score of 3 or more indicates severe pancreatitis with a higher risk of complications and mortality.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the Glasgow-Imrie Criteria. However, it should be noted that this scoring system is not intended to replace clinical judgment or guide treatment decisions in isolation. It should be used in conjunction with other clinical findings and diagnostic tests.

The Glasgow-Imrie Criteria is a clinical tool used to gauge the severity of acute pancreatitis by assessing various patient factors. To determine the total severity score, evaluate each of the following indicators, adding 1 point for each that is met:

- **Age greater than 55 years**
- **White blood cell count exceeding 15×10^3/mcL or 10^9/L**
- **Blood glucose level over 180 mg/dL or 10 mmol/L**

The description of blood urea nitrogen as an indicator was cut off, so no further details on that criterion can be provided.

### Interpretation of serum pancreatic enzymes in pancreatic and nonpancreatic conditions [^114UnGxW]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

The purpose of this review is to discuss the interpretation of serum pancreatic enzymes in various conditions. Serum levels of amylase and lipase can be elevated in nonpancreatic conditions, which may or may not be associated with abdominal pain. This often leads to patients being mistakenly diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. Consequently, this review aims to summarize the existing evidence on pancreatic enzyme elevation in multiple conditions and its practical implications in clinical settings.

- **Recent findings**: Serum amylase and lipase levels lack specificity for diagnosing pancreatitis. Recent efforts have been made to validate new biomarkers such as pancreatic elastase, serum trypsin, urinary trypsinogen-activated peptide, phospholipase A2, carboxypeptidase B, activated peptide of carboxypeptidase B, the trypsin 2 alpha 1 activation complex, and circulating cell-free DNA for acute pancreatitis diagnosis.

- **Summary**: Serum lipase levels, though more sensitive and specific than amylase, are insufficient for diagnosing acute pancreatitis in patients with abdominal pain. There is a pressing need to emphasize radiological evidence and consider higher enzyme elevation cut-off levels to achieve a more accurate diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.

### Elevated serum creatinine as a marker of pancreatic necrosis in acute pancreatitis [^115VvhUc]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Pancreatic necrosis is a serious complication of acute pancreatitis. The identification of simple laboratory tests to detect subjects at risk of pancreatic necrosis may direct management and improve outcomes. This study focuses on the association between routine laboratory tests and the development of pancreatic necrosis in patients with acute pancreatitis.

- **Methods**: In a cohort of 185 patients with acute pancreatitis prospectively enrolled in the Severity of Acute Pancreatitis Study, patients with contrast-enhanced computerized tomography performed were selected (n = 129). Serum hematocrit, creatinine, and urea nitrogen on admission and peak values within 48 hours of admission were analyzed. The volume of intravenous fluid resuscitation was calculated for each patient.

- **Results**: Of 129 patients, 35 (27%) had evidence of pancreatic necrosis. Receiver operating characteristic curves for pancreatic necrosis revealed an area under the curve of 0.79 for admission hematocrit, 0.77 for peak creatinine, and 0.72 for peak urea nitrogen. Binary logistic regression indicated that all three tests were significantly associated with pancreatic necrosis, and a creatinine level greater than 1.8 mg/dl within 48 hours yielded a positive predictive value of 93%.

- **Conclusions**: We confirm that a low admission hematocrit indicates a low risk of pancreatic necrosis.

### Metabolomics approaches in pancreatic adenocarcinoma: tumor metabolism profiling predicts clinical outcome of patients [^112JpPaY]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Our results about PA's metabolome show a higher level of lactate in patients who did not receive any neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Elevated expression of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) is highlighted in breast and colorectal cancers and has been recently identified in pancreatic cancers. Some studies have already shown the different steps where LDHA is involved, such as tumor initiation, maintenance, and progression. Given the elevated glycolysis in PA, leading to increased lactate production, the ability to utilize lactate could provide an additional advantage to PA cells. Indeed, the inhibition of glycolysis through suppressing LDHA expression by RNA interference decreased the growth of PA cells. Our study may provide new targets to treat PA.

When patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and patients who did not were compared, neoadjuvant chemotherapy seemed to have an inhibiting effect on LDHA expression. A higher level of lactate in patients who did not receive any neoadjuvant chemotherapy showed that survival of PA was highly dependent on LDHA activity in a hypoxic environment. This higher level of lactate could be linked to improved responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Indeed, lactate might be a predictive marker for assessing the response of tumor cells to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Finally, lactate could be correlated with tumor neoadjuvant chemotherapy in predicting responses to this therapy. Elevated levels of lactate are prognostic biomarkers for poor survival in several cancers. Our findings suggest that lactate could be an important marker for screening.

### Acute pancreatitis patient registry to examine novel therapies in clinical experience (APPRENTICE): An international, multicenter consortium for the study of acute pancreatitis [^113c3bLA]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Demographic information includes age, sex, race, weight, height, body mass index, and waist circumference measurement. Smoking history is classified as never smoker (6 months without smoking) and smoker (within the last 6 months). The total years of smoking and the average number of cigarettes per day are recorded. Alcohol consumption is classified as never (6 months without drinking) and current (within the last 6 months). The average number of drinks on a drinking day, the average drinking days per week, the total years of alcohol consumption, and the date of the last drink are obtained.

Information about personal history is recorded, including the prior history of acute pancreatitis (AP), the number of episodes, baseline triglyceride levels, and cholecystectomy status. The burden of comorbidities is measured using the Charlson Comorbidity Index. Information is sought regarding any first-degree relative with a history of AP, chronic pancreatitis, or cystic fibrosis. Any use of statins, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs within the last week, or other recently started medications is recorded. The dates of symptom onset and initial hospital admission are documented. If the patient is transferred from another hospital, the date of transfer is also registered. The primary etiology of AP is classified as biliary, alcoholic, idiopathic, hypertriglyceridemic, or subsequent to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.

### Classification of acute pancreatitis — 2012: Revision of the Atlanta classification and definitions by international consensus [^111wfLbS]. Gut (2013). High credibility.

The Revised Atlanta Classification for Acute Pancreatitis is a clinical scoring system used to classify the severity of acute pancreatitis. This classification system is applicable to patients who present with symptoms suggestive of acute pancreatitis, such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and elevated levels of pancreatic enzymes in the blood.

The Revised Atlanta Classification provides a standardized approach to stratify patients into different severity levels based on clinical and imaging findings. It categorizes acute pancreatitis into two phases: early (first week) and late (after the first week), and further classifies the disease into mild, moderately severe, and severe. This classification helps in predicting the clinical course, management, and prognosis of the disease.

The clinical utility of this calculator lies in its ability to guide clinicians in making decisions about the appropriate level of care, potential need for interventions, and to predict patient outcomes. It also aids in communication between healthcare providers and in research settings.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the Revised Atlanta Classification. However, it should be noted that it is not designed to diagnose acute pancreatitis but rather to classify the severity of the disease in patients in whom a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis has already been established based on clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings.

### Origin, presentation, and clinical course of nonpancreatic hyperlipasemia [^112DCcDD]. Pancreas (2016). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis (AP) is defined by a constellation of abnormal pancreatic enzymes, imaging, and characteristic pain. However, the origin and clinical significance of isolated hyperlipasemia remain unclear.

We prospectively evaluated patients with serum lipase levels greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) admitted to Los Angeles County Hospital from October 2014 to April 2015. Patients were identified by a daily laboratory query to support an ongoing randomized trial of goal-directed therapy for AP (NCT 01761539). Nonpancreatic hyperlipasemia (NPHL) was defined as a serum lipase level greater than three times the ULN without characteristic pain or imaging.

Among 221 patients with lipase levels exceeding three times the ULN, 170 met the criteria for AP, while 51 did not. The leading etiologies for NPHL included decompensated cirrhosis and renal failure. Patients with NPHL were significantly older, had more comorbidities, and possessed lower serum lipase levels (360 ± 36 vs. 1453 ± 135 IU/L, P < 0.001). No differences were observed in the length of hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, or mortality.

Elevated serum lipase levels have many nonpancreatic origins, with liver and renal failure being the most frequent. Distinct clinical features can aid in differentiating between AP and NPHL.

### Th1 and Th2 cytokine profiles as predictors of severity in acute pancreatitis [^11463aY5]. Pancreas (2018). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is severe in up to 20% of patients, with a high mortality rate. The quantification of serum TH1 and TH2 cytokines may provide objective evidence to assess the severity of AP and predict its course.

- **Methods**: One hundred seventeen patients were studied, measuring serum concentrations of interleukin (IL)1β, IL2, IL4, IL5, IL6, IL10, IL12p70, IL13, IL18, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon (IFN)-γ, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α.

- **Results**: Significant differences were found between patients with severe AP and those with mild or moderately severe AP in IFN-γ (P < 0.001), IL6 (P < 0.001), TNF-α (P = 0.002), GM-CSF (P < 0.001), IL4 (P = 0.002), IL1β (P = 0.017), and IL13 (P < 0.001) concentrations. Interferon-γ, IL6, and TNF-α were associated with severe AP, whereas GM-CSF, IL4, IL1β, and IL13 were associated with mild or moderately severe AP. The IL13/IFNγ ratio was significantly higher in patients with mild AP (P = 7.36 × 10).

- **Conclusions**: A TH1 profile was associated with severe AP and a TH2 profile with mild or moderately severe AP. We report an IL13/IFNγ ratio of potential value to predict the prognosis in AP.

### Accuracy of routine laboratory tests to predict mortality and deterioration to severe or critical COVID-19 in people with SARS-CoV-2 [^114sscBx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

LDH increase can be indicative of tissue damage or inflammation. LDH increase was assessed for the target conditions: mortality, deterioration, and the combined outcome.

- **Mortality (Figure 13)**: The cut-off values ranged from 5 to 629.50 U/L across 10 studies. One study reported a cut-off value of 5 U/L; without this study, cut-off values ranged from 225 to 629.50 U/L. One study reported different cut-off values for females and males, 225 and 241 U/L respectively. The sensitivity ranged from 55% to 95%, and specificity from 0% to 89%. The study with a cut-off value of 5 U/L reported a specificity of 0%. At a fixed specificity of 19% (Q1), 60% (median), and 80% (Q3), the meta-analysis found a sensitivity of 91% (95% CI 80% to 96%), 82% (95% CI 66% to 91%), and 74% (95% CI 53% to 88%), respectively.

- **Deterioration (Figure 14)**: The cut-off values ranged from 190 to 285 U/L across 12 studies. Sensitivity ranged from 53% to 97%, and specificity from 5% to 82%. At a fixed specificity of 51% (Q1), 66% (median), and 78% (Q3), the meta-analysis found a sensitivity of 80% (95% CI 76% to 83%), 79% (95% CI 76% to 82%), and 79% (95% CI 75% to 81%), respectively.

- **Combined outcome (4 studies)**: The cut-off values ranged between 250 and 400 U/L. Sensitivity ranged from 54% to 79%, and specificity from 45% to 82%. At a fixed specificity of 57% (Q1), 62% (median), and 68% (Q3), the meta-analysis found a sensitivity of 72% (95% CI 52% to 86%), 69% (95% CI 51% to 82%), and 64% (95% CI 45% to 80%), respectively.

### Utility of serum pancreatic enzyme levels in diagnosing blunt trauma to the pancreas: a prospective study with systematic review [^114FoFym]. Injury (2014). Low credibility.

The reliability of serum pancreatic enzyme levels in predicting pancreatic injuries has been a parameter of interest, with current recommendations based primarily on anecdotal observations. This study aimed to evaluate the utility of serum pancreatic enzyme assessment in predicting blunt pancreatic injury with imaging and surgical correlation, and to compare the results with a systematic review of the literature to date.

- **Methods**: A prospective cohort study was conducted over 4 years in a tertiary care referral center, involving 164 consecutive patients who presented to the emergency department with a history of blunt abdominal trauma. These patients had serum pancreatic enzyme assessments, ultrasonography, and subsequent diagnostic CECT. The CT findings and AAST grade of pancreatic injury, various intra-abdominal injuries, the time elapsed since injury, and other associated factors were correlated with serum pancreatic enzyme levels. For the systematic review of the literature, the MEDLINE database was searched between 1940 and 2012, and the related citations and bibliographies of relevant articles were analyzed, resulting in 40 articles being included for review. The results of this study were compared with the systematic critique of the literature to formulate recommendations.

- **Results**: Thirty-three (21%) patients had pancreatic injuries documented on CT and were graded according to AAST. Statistically significant elevated serum amylase levels were observed in patients with pancreatic and bowel injuries, while elevated serum lipase was specifically observed in patients with pancreatic injury.

### Does hyperlipasemia predict worse clinical outcomes in COVID-19? A multicenter retrospective cohort study [^114PRQ2c]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

We aim to perform a multicenter retrospective cohort study to determine if elevated serum lipase determines clinical outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Several cases of acute pancreatitis (AP) have recently been reported in association with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Most of the evidence is based on elevated serum lipase values without objective demonstration of pancreatic inflammation or necrosis.

A population-based, multicenter, retrospective cohort study utilizing TriNetX was performed to obtain aggregated health records of approximately 69 million patients from 49 health care organizations from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020. Adult patients (18 years and above) diagnosed with COVID-19 were identified using appropriate International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes and were stratified into two groups: those with elevated (≥ 180 U/L) and those with normal (≤ 80 U/L) serum lipase. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality; other outcomes included 30-day rehospitalization, need for mechanical ventilation, need for vasopressor use, and acute kidney injury.

A total of 435,731 adult patients with COVID-19 were identified, and 1,406 of them had elevated serum lipase, which was associated with higher 30-day mortality [risk ratio (RR) = 1.53, P < 0.001], risk of acute kidney injury (RR = 1.5, P = 0.003), and vasopressor use (RR = 1.69, P < 0.001), without any significant difference in 30-day rehospitalization (RR = 0.98, P = 0.54) or need for mechanical ventilation (RR = 1.20, P = 0.26).

### Lactate dehydrogenase levels predict coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity and mortality: A pooled analysis [^112hbMuZ]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection has now reached a pandemic state, affecting more than a million patients worldwide. Predictors of disease outcomes in these patients need to be urgently assessed to decrease morbidity and societal burden. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) has been associated with worse outcomes in patients with viral infections. In this pooled analysis of 9 published studies (n = 1532 COVID-19 patients), we evaluated the association between elevated LDH levels measured at the earliest time point in hospitalization and disease outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Elevated LDH levels were associated with a ~6-fold increase in odds of developing severe disease and a ~16-fold increase in odds of mortality in patients with COVID-19. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.

### Serum trypsin is a reliable biomarker of pancreas function [^1127mBXG]. Pancreas (2025). High credibility.

Pancreatic diseases pose significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges, necessitating robust biomarkers for accurate diagnosis, management, and monitoring of pancreas function. Pancreas function can be measured with direct (invasive) and indirect tests; however, neither approach allows for continuous disease monitoring to identify disease progression or therapeutic response.

We demonstrate literature evidence suggesting that trypsin, an important pancreatic digestive enzyme, holds promise as a continuous biomarker. Assessment of trypsin concentration in the serum sensitively and specifically detects pancreas inflammation, whereas declining trypsin levels in serum show good correlation with direct pancreatic function tests to identify exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.

With this comprehensive review, we aimed to evaluate the existing evidence on the utility of trypsin as a continuous biomarker. Our review spans acute to chronic pancreatitis and pancreas function, highlighting its potential in monitoring disease evolution on an individual patient level.

### Who's at risk? A prognostic model for severity prediction in pediatric acute pancreatitis [^1178UUkC]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). Low credibility.

Several adult studies have linked elevated BUN levels to increased severity in AP, whether as part of the bedside index for severity of AP scoring or as a stand-alone predictor of severity. The proposed mechanism is that the elevated BUN reflects intravascular volume depletion as opposed to renal involvement, given the lack of observed change in the creatinine between the two groups. There is also adult data to suggest that decreased albumin on admission is an independent predictor of disease severity in AP as a marker of persistent organ failure, both at admission and then again at 48 hours after admission, likely reflecting the underlying inflammatory state, although the precise mechanism remains unclear.

Persistent BUN elevation in our population was also predictive of severity, and BUN elevation at 24–48 hours was an independent predictor of severity in this population. This is a novel finding not previously reported in the pediatric literature. Although it showed similar trends from the adult literature, previous studies did not address the management effects on the BUN change. We have shown that persistent elevation of BUN was a predictor of SAP independent from rates and types of fluids the patient had received.

Multiple attempts have been made to develop prognostic models for severity in pediatric AP. DeBanto et al. developed the Pediatric Acute Pancreatitis Score, which was modeled after adult scoring metrics and involves demographic and biochemical data at admission and then again at 48 hours to calculate the score.

### Lysine-5 acetylation negatively regulates lactate dehydrogenase A and is decreased in pancreatic cancer [^116TUVkp]. Cancer Cell (2013). Low credibility.

Tumor cells commonly have increased glucose uptake and lactate accumulation. Lactate is produced from pyruvate by lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A), which is frequently overexpressed in tumor cells and is important for cell growth. Elevated transcription by c-Myc or HIF1α may contribute to increased LDH-A in some cancer types.

Here, we show that LDH-A is acetylated at lysine 5 (K5), and this acetylation inhibits LDH-A activity. Furthermore, the K5-acetylated LDH-A is recognized by the HSC70 chaperone and delivered to lysosomes for degradation. Replacement of endogenous LDH-A with an acetylation mimetic mutant decreases cell proliferation and migration.

Importantly, K5 acetylation of LDH-A is reduced in human pancreatic cancers, revealing a mechanism of LDH-A upregulation in pancreatic cancers.

### The utility of elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase in current clinical practice [^11554ccX]. Laboratory Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Because of its wide tissue distribution, elevation of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LD) is a nonspecific finding. Although serum LD is still included in the prognosis and staging of metastatic melanoma and germ cell tumors, its nonspecificity has led to decreased usefulness.

- **Methods**: In this study, we analyzed the serum LD assays performed in a 726-bed hospital during a 1-year period and reviewed charts of patients with serum LD of > 3 standard deviations (SD).

- **Results**: Of 312 patients with elevated serum LD, only 9 were patients with melanoma and germ cell tumors. The other 303 patients had other malignancies, chronic conditions, and sepsis.

- **Conclusion**: Elevated serum LD (even > 3 SD) is an extremely nonspecific finding that does not contribute to clinical management in a majority of patients. As such, serum LD testing should be retired from routine clinical order sets and restricted in use.

### Assessment of the prognostic value of certain acute-phase proteins and procalcitonin in the prognosis of acute pancreatitis [^115Uf6cb]. Pancreas (2008). Low credibility.

Of patients with acute pancreatitis (AP), 20% develop severe attacks that need early and intensive therapy. Yet, to administer such treatment, it is important to classify early on the patients with mild and severe pancreatitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of serum amyloid A, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and routinely measured parameters in the early prediction of the course of AP.

A total of 40 consecutive patients with AP confirmed by computed tomography were prospectively enrolled in the study; 29 were graded as mild and 11 were graded as severe. Blood samples were obtained on admission and 24 hours thereafter.

Procalcitonin concentration in both measurements was significantly higher in patients with severe pancreatitis, and the cutoff level was estimated at 0.5 ng/mL. Although serum amyloid A and C-reactive protein levels rose significantly during the period of observation, these were not differentiated between both groups. Among the routinely measured parameters, a prognostic value was found for total calcium concentration, lactic dehydrogenase activity, and glucose concentration.

The best efficiency in the early prediction of severe AP would be achieved with the measurement of procalcitonin, total calcium level, and lactic acid dehydrogenase activity immediately after admission to the ward.

### Clinical practice guideline: Management of acute pancreatitis [^113p99NM]. Canadian Journal of Surgery (2016). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis" is a useful tool for identifying and confirming acute pancreatitis in patients with relevant symptoms. The primary goal of these criteria is to enable accurate diagnosis, which facilitates timely and appropriate treatment.

The diagnostic criteria are based on three primary components: abdominal pain, elevated levels of lipase or amylase, and characteristic findings on imaging studies such as CT or MRI. The abdominal pain associated with acute pancreatitis is typically acute in onset, persistent, severe, and located in the epigastric region, often radiating to the back. The second component involves a significant increase in the levels of pancreatic enzymes, specifically lipase or amylase, to more than three times the upper limit of normal. The third component involves identifying characteristic findings indicative of acute pancreatitis on CT or MRI scans.

The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is confirmed if two of the three criteria are met. Acceptable combinations include the presence of abdominal pain and elevated enzyme levels, elevated enzyme levels and characteristic imaging findings, or abdominal pain and characteristic imaging findings. If these combinations are not met, the diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis are not fulfilled. This approach ensures a high degree of diagnostic accuracy.

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^115d2Swf]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Regarding the classification and risk stratification for acute pancreatitis, more specifically with respect to risk assessment, the WSES 2019 guidelines recommend considering the use of the BISAP score. The BISAP score is probably one of the most accurate and applicable in everyday clinical practice due to its simplicity and capability to predict severity, death, and organ failure. Additionally, the APACHE-II score, although very complex, is also recommended for predicting severe acute pancreatitis. Other scoring systems may also be utilized effectively.

### The pancreatitis outcome prediction (POP) score: A new prognostic index for patients with severe acute pancreatitis [^115Qa1pH]. Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Severe acute pancreatitis, defined as pancreatitis with distant organ dysfunction, is a condition that carries high mortality and morbidity. Outcome prediction scores are typically based on small populations, often from single specialist centers. Some scores cannot be applied until several days into hospital admission. Therefore, we sought to develop a new and more sensitive outcome prediction score, known as the pancreatitis outcome prediction (POP) score, for these high-risk patients.

This was a retrospective cohort study utilizing a large multicenter intensive care database from 159 U.K. intensive care units. A total of 2,462 patients admitted to intensive care units with severe acute pancreatitis participated in the study. No interventions were administered as part of this study.

- **Measurements and main results**: Demographic, physiologic, and biochemical data collected within the first 24 hours of intensive care unit admission were used to develop a risk prediction score using logistic regression. The six variables with the strongest relationship to hospital outcome — arterial pH, age, serum urea, mean arterial pressure, PaO2/FIO2 ratio, and total serum calcium (in order of decreasing impact) — produced a model with a prognostic discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.838) superior to other models. These six factors were used to develop an objectively weighted multivariate prognostic score ranging from 0 to 40 points.

Prognostic stratification of patients with severe acute pancreatitis requiring intensive care offers a useful audit tool to gauge unit performance.

### Correlation of serum and ascitic fluid soluble form urokinase plasminogen activator receptor levels with patient complications, disease severity, inflammatory markers, and prognosis in patients with severe acute pancreatitis [^113j6DC7]. Pancreas (2019). Low credibility.

As for the value of blood suPAR as a marker for disease severity in monitoring critical diseases, a previous study illuminates that a high level of suPAR (defined as > 11 ng/mL) is correlated with a higher possibility of hypotension and elevated SOFA score in patients with bacteremia. Another study exhibits that serum suPAR concentration on admission is closely and independently associated with levels of inflammatory markers (tumor necrosis factor, C-reactive protein), as well as hepatic and renal dysfunction in sepsis patients.

In a previous study from our research team, we observed that plasma suPAR level on the first therapeutical day was associated with a higher risk of MODS in patients with SIRS. Another previous study from our research team found that plasma suPAR level was positively correlated with disease severity, serum PCT level, APACHE II score, and SOFA score in patients with ARDS. These indicate that suPAR could serve as a marker for disease severity in critical diseases, especially inflammation-involved diseases.

However, little is known about the role of suPAR in monitoring disease severity in patients with SAP. In this present study, we discovered that serum suPAR level was positively correlated with APACHE II score, Balthazar index, and SOFA score in patients with SAP, and suPAR level was raised in patients with the presence of pancreatic necrosis, pancreatic infection, and MODS (these three conditions were severe complications related to SAP). The possible explanations are as follows: suPAR expression reflects coagulation, fibrinolysis, inflammation, and immune responses.

### Early prediction of organ failure by combined markers in patients with acute pancreatitis [^115paDQa]. The British Journal of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Several biological markers and clinical scoring systems have been used to predict the course of acute pancreatitis. Because organ failure is the most severe complication of the disease, prognostic markers and their combinations that would predict organ failure on hospital admission were sought.

- **Methods**: Some 351 consecutive patients with acute pancreatitis were studied. Blood samples were taken within 12 hours of admission. This case-control study included all 33 patients with organ failure and 99 matched controls without organ failure. Measurements included 19 prognostic markers and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score.

- **Results**: Plasma interleukin 10, serum glucose, and serum calcium were identified as independent predictors of organ failure by logistic regression analysis. Calcium level correlated with clinical onset of organ failure. The combination of interleukin 10 (more than 50 pg/ml) or calcium (less than 1.65 mmol/l) was a significantly better predictor than any single marker or APACHE II score, with a sensitivity of 88 percent, specificity 93 percent, and diagnostic odds ratio 94.

- **Conclusion**: Organ failure in acute pancreatitis can be predicted with high accuracy at hospital admission using a combination of plasma interleukin 10 and serum calcium measurements.

### Risk assessment in acute pancreatitis [^115xyXTy]. The British Journal of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis has a variable natural history and, in a proportion of patients, is associated with severe complications and a significant risk of death. The various tools available for risk assessment in acute pancreatitis are reviewed.

- **Methods**: Relevant medical literature from PubMed, Ovid, Embase, Web of Science, and The Cochrane Library websites up to May 2008 was reviewed.

- **Results and conclusion**: Over the past 30 years, several scoring systems have been developed to predict the severity of acute pancreatitis in the first 48–72 hours. Biochemical and immunological markers, imaging modalities, and novel predictive models may help identify patients at high risk of complications or death. Recently, there has been recognition of the importance of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome and organ dysfunction.

### Association between time in range 70–180 mg/dl in early stage and severity with in patients acute pancreatitis [^116zVvfE]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) was diagnosed if two of the following three criteria were met clinically: (1) acute, sudden, continuous, and severe upper abdominal pain, which can radiate to the back; (2) serum amylase and/or lipase activities were at least three times higher than the upper limit of normal; (3) enhanced CT/MRI showed typical imaging changes of AP, such as pancreatic edema or peripancreatic effusion.

Individuals were divided into two groups according to the severity of pancreatitis at discharge diagnosis: (1) mild group: patients who met the diagnostic criteria for AP without organ failure and local or systemic complications during hospitalization; (2) severe group, including moderately severe acute pancreatitis (MSAP) and severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), accompanied by transient organ failure, which can be recovered within 48 hours, or accompanied by single or multiple organ failure continuously for more than 48 hours.

### Factors predicting the development of necrosis in patients presenting with edematous acute pancreatitis [^114XKkBS]. Pancreas (2023). Low credibility.

There is no marker that can accurately predict the development of pancreatic necrosis in edematous acute pancreatitis (AP). This study aimed to investigate the factors associated with necrosis development in cases of edematous AP and to create an easy-to-use scoring system.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed patients diagnosed with edematous AP between 2010 and 2021. Among the patients, those found to have developed necrosis during follow-up were categorized as the necrotizing group, whereas the others constituted the edematous group.

- **Results**: With multivariate analysis, white blood cell, hematocrit, lactate dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein levels at the 48th hour were revealed to be independent risk factors for necrosis. Using these four independent predictors, the Necrosis Development Score 48 (NDS-48) was derived. While the cutoff value was 2.5, the sensitivity and specificity of the NDS-48 for necrosis were 92.5% and 85.9%, respectively. The area under the curve value of the NDS-48 for necrosis was 0.949 (95% confidence interval, 0.920–0.977).

- **Conclusions**: White blood cell, hematocrit, lactate dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein levels at the 48th hour are independent predictors of necrosis development. The NDS-48, a new scoring system created with these four predictors, satisfactorily predicted the development of necrosis.

### WSES project on decision support systems based on artificial neural networks in emergency surgery [^111cuZva]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

The first attempt to predict the severity of acute pancreatitis using an artificial neural network (ANN) was undertaken by Kazmierczak et al, who analyzed the serum concentration of pancreatic enzymes in blood serum. Pancreatic lipase was found to be the best predictor of the severity of acute pancreatitis, with an accuracy of 82% (95% confidence interval (CI): 77–87). In contrast, using the serum amylase value, the prediction accuracy was quite low — 76% (71–81). Meanwhile, the combination of indicators such as lipase and amylase did not significantly increase the accuracy of the created ANN, with a predictive accuracy of 84% (79–89).

Pofahl et al. used ANN to predict the hospital length of stay (LOS) for patients with acute pancreatitis (AP). In their study, they compared ANNs with the Ranson and APACHE II scoring systems in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and accuracy. The authors reported high sensitivity (75%), specificity (81%), and accuracy (79%) of ANN in identifying the severity of acute pancreatitis as measured by LOS.

In research by Keogan et al, a neural network model was used to predict a prolonged treatment duration for a patient with AP, beyond the average of 8.4 days. The ANN demonstrated the best predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.83 ± 0.05) compared to Ranson (AUC = 0.68 ± 0.06; P < 0.02) and Balthazar (AUC = 0.62 ± 0.06; P < 0.003). However, there were no significant differences in predicting the duration of treatment for acute pancreatitis (AUC = 0.82 ± 0.05; P = 0.53) when compared with the linear discriminant function.

### A critical evaluation of laboratory tests in acute pancreatitis [^113qnK58]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

An ideal laboratory test in the evaluation of a patient with acute pancreatitis (AP) should, in addition to accurately establishing the diagnosis of AP, provide early assessment of its severity and identify the etiology. None of the tests available today meet all these criteria, and presently there is no biochemical test that can be considered the "gold standard" for the diagnosis and assessment of severity of AP.

In the diagnosis of AP, serum amylase and lipase remain important tests. Advantages of amylase estimation are its technical simplicity, easy availability, and high sensitivity. However, its greatest disadvantage is its low specificity. A normal amylase would usually exclude the diagnosis of AP, with the exception of AP secondary to hyperlipidemia, acute exacerbation of chronic pancreatitis, and when the estimation of amylase is delayed in the course of the disease.

The major advantage of lipase is an increased sensitivity in acute alcoholic pancreatitis and in patients who initially present to the emergency room days after the onset of the disease, as lipase remains elevated longer than amylase. Although once considered to be specific for AP, nonspecific elevations of lipase have been reported in almost as many disorders as amylase, thus decreasing its specificity. Simultaneous estimation of amylase and lipase does not improve the accuracy.

Other enzymes for the diagnosis of AP — pancreatic isoamylase, immunoreactive trypsin, and elastase — are more cumbersome and expensive and have no clear role in the diagnosis of AP. No enzyme assay has a predictive role in determining the disease's course.

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^116wN9ax]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Over time, most scoring systems for severe acute pancreatitis were developed based on patient demographics, clinical features, laboratory parameters, or imaging modalities. These scores are typically assessed on admission or within 48 hours. The notable scoring systems include:

- **Historical scoring systems**: Ranson criteria (1974), Glasgow-Imrie score (1978)
- **Physiological scoring systems**: Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II), Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II) (1984), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)
- **Imaging-based scoring system**: CT severity index (CTSI)
- **Recent scoring systems**: Bedside Index of Severity in Acute Pancreatitis (BISAP) score (2008), Japanese Severity Score

Predictors, or potential predictors, present in almost all the scoring systems mentioned above include:

- **Patient demographics and history**: Age, organ failure or immunocompromise, previous history of chronic disease, body mass index
- **Vital signs and consciousness**: Temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, consciousness level
- **Clinical features**: Presence of peritonitis, presence of acute renal failure
- **Laboratory parameters**:
	- **Blood analysis**: Blood white cell count, blood hematocrit, blood platelet count, blood glucose, blood urea nitrogen
	- **Serum markers**: Serum creatinine, serum aspartate transaminase, serum lactate dehydrogenase, serum calcium, serum electrolytes, serum bilirubin
	- **Plasma components**: Plasma albumin
- **Oxygenation and acid-base balance**: Oxygen saturation, pH, base deficit
- **Imaging modalities**: Multiple imaging modalities, principally CT

The APACHE II score evaluates the chronic health score and 12 physiological measurements. However, it is not specific for acute pancreatitis and is not designed for day-to-day evaluation in any patient. The advantages of this score include being a widely validated instrument and its adaptability for use at any time. The disadvantages are that it is cumbersome, and not all parameters are routinely collected.

### Man with epigastric pain and persistently elevated serum lipase [^113hMxVS]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Serum lipase and amylase are commonly requested in individuals presenting with abdominal pain for the investigation of acute pancreatitis. Pancreatic hyperenzymaemia is not specific to acute pancreatitis, occurring in many other pancreatic and non-pancreatic conditions. When persistent elevation of serum lipase and amylase occurs in the absence of a diagnosed cause or evidence of laboratory assay interference, ongoing radiological assessment for pancreatic disease is required for 24 months before a diagnosis of benign pancreatic hyperenzymaemia can be made. We report a case of a 71-year-old man with epigastric pain and elevated serum lipase levels. He was extensively investigated, but no pancreatic disease was detected. He is asymptomatic, but serum lipase levels remain elevated 18 months after his initial presentation.

### Determinant-based classification of acute pancreatitis severity: An international multidisciplinary consultation [^1178xaaf]. Annals of Surgery (2012). High credibility.

The Determinant-Based Classification of Acute Pancreatitis Severity is a clinical tool designed to stratify the severity of acute pancreatitis (AP) in patients. This classification aids in predicting the clinical course and outcomes, thereby guiding appropriate management strategies.

The primary components of this classification system include the presence and nature of pancreatic or peripancreatic necrosis, and the presence and duration of organ failure. Necrosis can be absent, sterile, or infected, while organ failure can be absent, transient (lasting less than or equal to 48 hours), or persistent (lasting more than 48 hours).

The severity of acute pancreatitis is determined based on these components. A patient is classified as having mild AP if there is no necrosis and no organ failure. Moderate AP is diagnosed if sterile necrosis or transient organ failure is present. Severe AP is indicated by the presence of infected necrosis or persistent organ failure. Lastly, critical AP is diagnosed if both infected necrosis and persistent organ failure are present.

This classification system provides a comprehensive and nuanced approach to assessing the severity of acute pancreatitis, allowing for more precise prognostication and management of this potentially life-threatening condition.

### Serum C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and lactate dehydrogenase for the diagnosis of pancreatic necrosis [^11431Lov]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

The treatment of people with pancreatic necrosis differs from that of people with oedematous pancreatitis. It is important to know the diagnostic accuracy of serum C-reactive protein (CRP), serum procalcitonin, and serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as a triage test for the detection of pancreatic necrosis in people with acute pancreatitis, so that an informed decision can be made as to whether the person with pancreatic necrosis needs further investigations, such as a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, and treatment for pancreatic necrosis started.

There is currently no standard clinical practice, although CRP, particularly an increasing trend of CRP, is often used as a triage test to determine whether the person requires further imaging. There is also currently no systematic review of the diagnostic test accuracy of CRP, procalcitonin, and LDH for the diagnosis of pancreatic necrosis in people with acute pancreatitis.

- **Objectives**: To compare the diagnostic accuracy of CRP, procalcitonin, or LDH (index test), either alone or in combination, in the diagnosis of necrotising pancreatitis in people with acute pancreatitis and without organ failure.

- **Search methods**: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, National Institute for Health Research (NIHR HTA and DARE), and other databases until March 2017. We searched the references of the included studies to identify additional studies. We did not restrict studies based on language or publication status, or whether data were collected prospectively or retrospectively.

### Apache II: A severity of disease classification system [^116mXfA9]. Critical Care Medicine (1985). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "APACHE II" is utilized for assessing critical illness, mechanical ventilation, thyroid storm, disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute cholangitis, acute cholecystitis, acute diverticulitis, acute pancreatitis, acute appendicitis, intra-abdominal abscess, community-acquired pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, and sepsis and septic shock.

The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) is a severity-of-disease classification system specifically designed for critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). It is a composite score that incorporates 12 physiological variables, including vital signs, arterial blood gas measurements, and serum biochemical parameters, along with age and chronic health status. The score ranges from 0 to 71, with higher scores indicating a higher severity of illness and a higher risk of mortality.

The APACHE II score is primarily used to predict ICU mortality and can also provide an estimate of ICU length of stay. It is a valuable tool for risk stratification, enabling clinicians to identify patients who may require more intensive monitoring and intervention, and facilitating communication about patient prognosis.

However, the APACHE II score should not be used in isolation to guide clinical decision-making, as it does not account for all individual patient factors. It is also not applicable to pediatric patients or patients admitted to the ICU after cardiac surgery, as it was not validated in these populations.

### Definitions of pediatric pancreatitis and survey of present clinical practices [^114CFYBK]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2012). High credibility.

The INSPPIRE (International Study Group of Pediatric Pancreatitis: In Search for a Cure) diagnostic criteria is a clinical calculator specifically designed for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis in pediatric patients. This scoring system is used to identify children who are likely to have acute pancreatitis based on a combination of symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory results. The INSPPIRE criteria include abdominal pain characteristic of pancreatitis, serum amylase and/or lipase levels greater than three times the upper limit of normal, and imaging findings consistent with acute pancreatitis.

The clinical utility of this calculator is to provide a standardized method for diagnosing acute pancreatitis in children, which can help guide treatment decisions and predict prognosis. There are no specific exclusion criteria for its use, but it should be noted that it is not intended to replace clinical judgment or to be used in isolation. It should be used in conjunction with a comprehensive clinical assessment.

The INSPPIRE diagnostic criteria are used to evaluate the likelihood of pediatric acute pancreatitis by assessing three specific clinical factors. These factors are:

- **Whether abdominal pain suggestive of or compatible with acute pancreatitis is present**: Characterized by acute onset, especially in the epigastric region.
- **Serum amylase and/or lipase activity**: Must be at least more than three times the upper limit of normal.
- **Imaging findings**: Should be consistent with acute pancreatitis.

### Common and rare variants associating with serum levels of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase [^116E5z8K]. Nature Communications (2016). Low credibility.

The release of intracellular enzymes into the serum is an indicator of tissue damage and physiological cell turnover. Thus, measurements of intracellular enzymes in serum are widely used to diagnose tissue damage, monitor its course and severity, and gauge the effect of therapy.

Creatine kinase (CK) is an enzyme catalyzing the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of creatine, which is important for energy buffering in tissues with variable energy demands, most notably skeletal and cardiac muscle. Elevated serum CK levels can indicate tissue damage and are observed in numerous pathological conditions, including statin-induced myopathy. Monitoring changes in serum CK levels is therefore important in statin-treated patients who display muscle pain or weakness, and in patients deemed at risk of rhabdomyolysis for various reasons.

Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is an enzyme with ubiquitous expression. It is responsible for catalyzing the anaerobic, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent conversion of pyruvate to lactate, which is important during times of high muscular activity. Serum CK and LDH levels were previously used as biomarkers to diagnose myocardial infarction. However, because of low specificity, they have been replaced by troponin T and troponin I, measured through high-sensitivity assays.

The heritability of LDH levels has been estimated between 40 and 50%, and upwards of 38% for CK. Our own data indicates a 19.33% and 19.36% heritability for CK and LDH, respectively. A recently published genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 3,232,779 imp

### Abdominal pain and hyperamylasaemia — not always pancreatitis [^1168XaEd]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Low credibility.

A raised serum amylase concentration, at least four times the upper limit of normal (ULN), is used to support the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis in a patient presenting with abdominal pain. The authors report a case of toxic shock syndrome complicated by a raised serum amylase concentration that peaked at 50 times the ULN in a patient with recurrent abdominal pain. The most common cause of hyperamylasaemia is pancreatic; however, further investigation of serum lipase and amylase isoenzyme studies found this to be of salivary origin and attributable to soft tissue inflammation of the salivary gland. This case highlights the need to consider non-pancreatic causes of hyperamylasaemia.

### Laboratory diagnostic tests in acute pancreatitis [^111aMxBD]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis depends on a combination of clinical assessment and laboratory testing. Although serum amylase is the cornerstone laboratory test used in establishing the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, there are limitations in its sensitivity and specificity that clinicians should recognize. The serum lipase level may be especially useful in patients with alcohol-induced acute pancreatitis. A new urinary test strip that uses trypsinogen-2 may have a role in establishing the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. In addition, several new laboratory tests and new interpretations of existing laboratory tests may assist in determining the etiology and severity of acute pancreatitis. This review summarizes important aspects of standard laboratory tests and novel laboratory approaches in diagnosing, understanding the etiology, and assessing the severity of acute pancreatitis.

### Predictive factors for severe evolution in acute pancreatitis and a new score for predicting a severe outcome [^115TVgoZ]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

The study was retrospective and included 712 patients diagnosed with acute pancreatitis (AP) and admitted to our department during an almost six-year period (January 2006 - December 2011). AP was defined as the sudden onset of pain in the upper part of the abdomen, associated with increased serum lipase (more than three times the upper normal value). A total of 183 cases were excluded due to incomplete data, leaving 529 patients for the final analysis.

The 529 patients included in the study were divided into two categories:

- **Initial group**: This group consisted of 334 patients admitted between 2006–2009, used to develop the new algorithm for predicting severe outcomes in AP.

- **Validation group**: This group consisted of 195 patients admitted in 2010 and 2011, used for the validation of the new score.

AP was classified as mild or severe, according to the Atlanta criteria. Criteria for severity included organ failure (shock–systolic pressure < 90 mmHg), renal failure (creatinine levels > 2.0 mg/L after rehydration), or gastrointestinal bleeding > 500 cc/24 h; and/or local complications (especially pancreatic necrosis, but also including abscess and pseudocyst). Early predictors of severity within 48 hours of initial hospitalization included a Ranson score ≥ 3 and/or an APACHE-II score ≥ 8. Biological tests and imaging investigations [ultrasound examination, CT, and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans] were performed to classify patients according to the Atlanta criteria.

According to the etiology, AP was classified as: alcoholic, biliary, and non-alcoholic, non-biliary — nonA-nonB.

### New prognostic markers for outcome of acute pancreatitis: Overview of reporting in 184 studies [^112ttvYy]. Pancreas (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the reporting of studies on new prognostic markers of outcome in acute pancreatitis.

- **Methods**: We used MEDLINE searches complemented with perusal of review articles' references to identify eligible English-language studies. We included studies evaluating nonroutine markers for acute pancreatitis. Eligible outcomes included Atlanta criteria, Japanese criteria for severity, multiple/single organ failure, complications, interventional treatment, hospitalization length, and death. We generated a 47-item checklist on acute pancreatitis prognosis by adapting a previously constructed reporting guidance instrument for prognostic tumor markers (REMARK [Reporting Recommendations for Tumor Marker Prognostic Studies]). The checklist addresses the reporting of essential information in prognostic studies.

- **Results**: The 184 identified eligible studies reported on 196 different prognostic markers. One hundred forty-four studies (78.3%) found at least 1 prognostic marker to be nominally statistically significant. Significant improvements over time were seen in the reporting for 17 items, but major deficiencies were noted even in 2004–2009 studies. Particularly, 12 items were reported in less than 10% of studies overall and even within the most recent studies.

- **Conclusions**: Despite some improvements over time, the reporting of important aspects of prognostic studies in acute pancreatitis remains suboptimal. The proposed REMARK-based checklist may help improve the quality and reporting of research in this field.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for acute pancreatitis, specifically with respect to risk assessment, the BPIGS 2016 guidelines recommend diagnosing severe acute pancreatitis in patients meeting any of the following criteria:

- **CRP levels**: CRP ≥ 14,286 nmol/L (150 mg/dL) at baseline or in the first 72 hours.
- **APACHE II score**: APACHE II score ≥ 8 at baseline or in the first 72 hours.
- **Persistent organ failure**: Signs of persistent organ failure for more than 48 hours despite adequate IV fluid resuscitation.

### Hr-mas MRS of the pancreas reveals reduced lipid and elevated lactate and taurine associated with early pancreatic cancer [^111vTdWz]. NMR in Biomedicine (2014). Low credibility.

The prognosis for patients with pancreatic cancer is extremely poor, as evidenced by the disease's five-year survival rate of approximately 5%. New approaches are urgently needed to improve the detection, treatment, and monitoring of pancreatic cancer. MRS-detectable metabolic changes provide useful biomarkers for tumor detection and response-monitoring in other cancers. The goal of this study was to identify MRS-detectable biomarkers of pancreatic cancer that could enhance currently available imaging approaches.

We used H high-resolution magic angle spinning MRS to probe metabolite levels in pancreatic tissue samples from mouse models and patients. In mice, lipid levels dropped significantly in pancreata with lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation, pre-cancerous metaplasia (4-week-old p48-Cre; LSL-Kras(G12D) mice), and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia, which precedes invasive pancreatic cancer (8-week-old p48-Cre LSL-Kras(G12D) mice), to 26 ± 19% (p = 0.03), 19 ± 16% (p = 0.04), and 26 ± 10% (p = 0.05) of controls, respectively. Lactate and taurine levels remained unchanged in inflammation and pre-cancerous metaplasia but increased significantly in pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia to 266 ± 61% (p = 0.0001) and 999 ± 174% (p < 0.00001) of controls, respectively.

Importantly, analysis of patient biopsies was consistent with the mouse findings. Lipids dropped in pancreatitis and invasive cancer biopsies to 29 ± 15% (p = 0.01) and 26 ± 38% (p = 0.02) of normal tissue, respectively. Additionally, lactate and taurine levels remained unchanged in…

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^1112MVtk]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

- **Results**: Severe acute pancreatitis is associated with persistent organ failure (cardiovascular, respiratory, and/or renal) and high mortality. Both new classification systems, Revised Atlanta Classification and Determinant-based Classification of Acute Pancreatitis Severity, are similar in establishing the diagnosis and severity of acute pancreatitis. Patients with persistent organ failure and infected necrosis have the highest risk of death. It is recommended that patients with organ failures be admitted to an intensive care unit whenever possible.

- **Diagnosis**:

- **Questions**:
	1. What are the criteria to establish the diagnosis of severe acute pancreatitis?
	2. What is the appropriate imaging work-up in cases of suspected severe acute pancreatitis? What roles do magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scan, ultrasound (US), endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), and other ancillary tests play?
	3. Which laboratory parameters should be considered in the diagnostic process?
	4. How do different etiologies affect the diagnostic workup?
	5. Which scores are indicated for risk assessment?
	6. What is the timing and the most suitable test for early follow-up imaging?

- **Discussion**: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is characterized by acute inflammation of the pancreas and histologically acinar cell destruction. The diagnosis of AP requires at least the presence of two of the following three criteria: (i) abdominal pain consistent with the disease, (ii) biochemical evidence of pancreatitis, such as serum amylase and/or lipase levels greater than three times the upper limit.

### Diagnosing acute pancreatitis-clinical and radiological characterisation of patients without threefold increase of serum lipase [^115XRxDE]. European Journal of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Diagnosing acute pancreatitis (AP) may be challenging in patients with acute abdominal pain but missing threefold increased serum lipase levels (Lip-). This study aims both to characterize these patients using clinical, radiological, and mortality data, and to assess the group of patients who need contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT).

In this retrospective, IRB-approved study, 234 consecutive patients with AP were investigated. Inclusion criteria were single (SAP) and reattacks (RAP) of AP and CECT ≥ 72h after the onset of symptoms. The severity of AP was assessed by C-reactive protein at 48h after hospital admission and using three CT-based scores (CTSI, mCTSI, EPIC) by two observers. Mortality rates from pancreatic and non-pancreatic causes were noted with regard to lipase increase. Results were compared with paired t-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

In the findings, 64 out of 234 (27%) patients belonged to the Lip- group and 170 out of 234 (73%) patients were allocated to the Lip+ group. Significantly more male patients (78% in Lip- vs. 63% in Lip+, p < 0.05) with RAP (63% in Lip- vs. 21% in Lip+, p < 0.001) were observed in the Lip- group. EPIC was significantly lower in the Lip- group compared to the Lip+ group (3(IQR 2–5) vs. 2(IQR 1–3), p < 0.001). Mortality from pancreatic and non-pancreatic causes was comparable in Lip- and Lip+ groups (pancreatic causes: 9% vs. 6%, p = 0.60; non-pancreatic causes: 8% vs. 5%, p = 0.58).

In conclusion, 27% of all patients with AP presented without a threefold increase in lipase levels. Thus, they would be underdiagnosed without confirming CECT, which revealed significant differences.

### The harmless acute pancreatitis score: A clinical algorithm for rapid initial stratification of nonsevere disease [^111k8wNy]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2009). High credibility.

The Harmless Acute Pancreatitis Score (HAPS) is a clinical calculator used in the management of patients with acute pancreatitis. This scoring system is specifically designed to predict the likelihood of a benign course of acute pancreatitis within the first 24 hours of admission. The HAPS is calculated based on five parameters: hematocrit, age, pleural effusion, sex, and serum calcium levels.

The clinical utility of the HAPS is to assist clinicians in identifying patients who are likely to have a mild course of acute pancreatitis, thereby aiding in decision-making regarding hospital admission, level of care, and resource allocation.

The HAPS should not be used in patients with chronic pancreatitis or those with a known history of severe acute pancreatitis, as it is not designed to predict severity in these populations. Additionally, it may not be accurate in patients with conditions that can affect the parameters used in the score, such as chronic kidney disease, which can affect serum calcium levels, or lung disease, which can cause pleural effusion.

The Harmless Acute Pancreatitis Score (HAPS) is a tool used to evaluate the severity of acute pancreatitis based on three clinical criteria. Each criterion can contribute one point to a total score ranging from 0 to 3. The inputs evaluated are binary, with each input being true (affirmative) or false:

- **Peritonitis**: Rebound tenderness or guarding.
- **Elevated creatinine levels**: Greater than or equal to 2 mg/dL or 177 mcmol/L.

### Faster discharge with lactated ringers than normal saline in first 72 h of acute pancreatitis: A multicenter randomized trial [^11654Z9c]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

Data-driven strategies for acute pancreatitis (AP) in pediatrics are limited; adult data suggests lactated ringers (LR), compared to normal saline (NS), result in favorable outcomes but have not been studied in pediatrics. Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy of LR during the first 48 hours of an AP episode compared with NS.

A multisite randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted from 2015 to 2020 (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03242473). Patients were randomized to receive either exclusively LR or NS for the first 48 hours. The primary outcomes were serial C-reactive protein (CRP) values. Secondary outcomes included other lab values, time to feeds, length of stay (LOS), systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) development, and progression to severe AP (SAP).

We studied 76 patients (38 receiving LR and 38 NS). CRP values at 24 and 48 hours were not significantly different between the LR and NS groups. Additionally, there were no differences in trends of BUN, amylase, lipase, SIRS status, or SAP development between the LR and NS groups at 24 and 48 hours. A higher proportion of patients in the LR group (32%, 12/38) were discharged before 48 hours compared to the NS group (13%, 5/38). The LR group had a significantly higher rate of discharge within the first 72 hours compared to the NS group (p = 0.02).

Use of LR was associated with a faster rate of discharge during the intervention period and in the first 72 hours, but there were no other differences compared to NS. This reduction in the length of hospitalization has significant implications for patients and healthcare costs.

### Hemoconcentration and pancreatic necrosis: Further defining the relationship [^111o88Rs]. Pancreas (2006). Low credibility.

In the setting of acute pancreatitis, an admission hematocrit greater than or equal to 44% and/or a failure of hematocrit to drop at 24 hours have been reported as useful markers to predict subsequent necrosis. We aimed to validate the use of hemoconcentration as a marker to predict necrosis in adult patients presenting with acute pancreatitis.

- **Methods**: Patients admitted to our medical center from 1990 to 2003 with a first presentation of acute pancreatitis were identified. Charts were abstracted for baseline demographic and clinical information, including admission and 24-hour hematocrit, and subsequent hospital course. Necrosis was determined based on computed tomography scan. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (NPV) for different admissions, and 24-hour hematocrit levels in predicting the subsequent development of necrosis.

- **Results**: Two hundred thirty patients were identified. Admission hematocrit (greater than or equal to 44%) was a poor predictor of subsequent necrosis with a sensitivity of 52.9%. The absence of hemoconcentration at admission or a drop in the 24-hour hematocrit level was reliable in predicting that patients would not develop necrosis (NPV of 94.7% for hematocrit greater than or equal to 44%). Results were similar when we compared a range of admission and 24-hour hematocrit values.

- **Conclusions**: In a community setting with low rates of necrosis, admission and 24-hour hematocrit levels were not helpful in predicting subsequent necrosis. The absence of admission hemoconcentration had strong NPV for necrosis.

### Acute pancreatitis [^112pt1id]. Lancet (2008). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory disease of the pancreas. Acute abdominal pain is the most common symptom, and increased concentrations of serum amylase and lipase confirm the diagnosis. Pancreatic injury is mild in 80% of patients, who recover without complications. The remaining patients have a severe disease with local and systemic complications. Gallstone migration into the common bile duct and alcohol abuse are the most frequent causes of pancreatitis in adults. About 15–25% of pancreatitis episodes are of unknown origin.

Treatment of mild disease is supportive, but severe episodes need management by a multidisciplinary team including gastroenterologists, interventional radiologists, intensivists, and surgeons. Improved understanding of pathophysiology and better assessments of disease severity should ameliorate the management and outcome of this complex disease.

### Acute pancreatitis [^111SdqrS]. BMJ (2014). High credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is a disease associated with various symptoms and risk factors. Key indicators include elevated serum amylase and lipase levels, vomiting, fever, gallstones, and nausea. Patients may also experience epigastric abdominal pain, right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, and abdominal guarding. Alcohol use disorder, cigarette smoking, and recent surgery are recognized risk factors. Clinical signs can include Fox's sign, increased urine pancreatic amylase, ascites, elevated serum ALT, abnormal ECG findings, and increased serum immunoreactive trypsinogen. Other symptoms involve jaundice, tenderness to palpation, anorexia, and abdominal pain radiating to the back. The condition can worsen with certain factors like obesity, traumatic injury, cystic fibrosis, sinus tachycardia, shock, metabolic disorders, medications use, abdominal tympany, decreased bowel sounds, decreased serum calcium, hematemesis, inflammation, and abdominal rigidity.

### Applying Ockham's razor to pancreatitis prognostication: A four-variable predictive model [^115yKEXs]. Annals of Surgery (2006).

We sought to develop a simple yet accurate prognostic scoring system to determine the severity of acute pancreatitis at admission. Because acute pancreatitis has a variable and frequently unpredictable course, identifying individuals at greatest risk for significant, life-threatening complications and stratifying their care appropriately remain a concern. Previous prognostic scoring systems predict severity reasonably well but are limited by time constraints, are unwieldy to use, or both.

Data from the international phase III trial of the platelet-activating factor receptor-antagonist Lexipafant were used to develop a 4-variable prognostic model. We then compared the model's ability to predict the severity of acute pancreatitis with the Ranson, Glasgow, and APACHE II systems.

The model (BALI), which included BUN ≥ 25 mg/dL, Age ≥ 65 years, LDH ≥ 300 IU/L, and IL-6 ≥ 300 pg/mL, measured at admission, was similar to the Ranson, Glasgow, and APACHE II systems in its ability to identify increased mortality from acute pancreatitis. The receiver operating characteristic curve area for the BALI model was ≥ 0.82 ± 0.03 (mean ± SD) versus 0.75 ± 0.04 (Ranson), 0.80 ± 0.03 (Glasgow), and 0.79 ± 0.03 (APACHE II). Furthermore, at a prevalence of 15%, the positive and negative predictive values for increased mortality were similar for all systems.

The prognostic ability of the BALI 4-variable model was similar to the Ranson, Glasgow, and APACHE II systems but is unique in its simplicity and ability.

### Therapeutic strategies toward lactate dehydrogenase within the tumor microenvironment of pancreatic cancer [^112o8Ywc]. Pancreas (2020). Low credibility.

Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) play a key metabolic role within the tumor microenvironment (stroma) of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), being glycolytic and associated with protumorigenic acidification from excess lactate. This study investigates the clinical significance of the glycolytic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and determines the efficacy of the novel pan-LDH inhibitor, Galloflavin.

- **Methods**: An in vitro Transwell system was adopted for coculture of PSCs and three PDAC cell lines (MIA PaCa-2, PANC-1, and BxPC-3). Cells were treated with Galloflavin and outcomes were analyzed regarding proliferation, apoptosis, lactate production, and glycolytic enzyme protein expression. Immunohistochemical staining for lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) was performed on 59 resected PDAC tumors annotated for clinical outcome.

- **Results**: Galloflavin reduced PDAC proliferation in monoculture (P < 0.01); however, in coculture with PSCs, an antiproliferative effect was only evident in PANC-1 (P = 0.001). An apoptotic effect was observed in MIA PaCa-2 and BxPC-3 in coculture (P < 0.05). A reduction in media lactate was observed in coculture (P < 0.01) with PSCs. Immunohistochemistry revealed stromal and tumoral LDHB expression had no impact on survival.

- **Conclusions**: Galloflavin has the potential to neutralize the acidic PDAC microenvironment and thereby reduce tumor invasiveness and metastasis. Patients with lower LDHB expression are more likely to be beneficial responders.
