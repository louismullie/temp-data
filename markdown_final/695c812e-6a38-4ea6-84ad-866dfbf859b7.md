## Question

Sick sinus syndrome pharmacological treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about pharmacologic treatment of sick sinus syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical entity and its pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the overarching treatment principle of addressing reversible causes. Next, I will examine acute pharmacologic management for symptomatic bradycardia, followed by chronic pharmacologic strategies and their limitations. After that, I need to consider special scenarios like tachy-brady syndrome and medication-induced bradycardia. Finally, I should integrate nonpharmacologic definitive therapy and synthesize a practical, stepwise approach with safety checks and contraindications.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and its mechanisms so I don't anchor prematurely on pacing alone. Sick sinus syndrome, or sinus node dysfunction, reflects impaired impulse formation or conduction from the sinoatrial node, often due to age-related degenerative fibrosis, ion channel dysfunction, or extrinsic factors such as medications, ischemia, electrolyte disturbances, or autonomic imbalance, and it commonly coexists with atrial fibrillation in the tachy-brady phenotype, which complicates management decisions [^114kpYTX] [^115trHF2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about drugs before we address reversible causes, because that's foundational. I need to ensure we prioritize identifying and correcting extrinsic contributors such as beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, electrolyte derangements, hypothyroidism, sleep apnea, or acute ischemia, since removing or mitigating the offending factor can obviate the need for chronic pacing in some cases and is a Class I recommendation in guidelines [^1125cjW8] [^1112Tia9] [^112d93nF].

> Next, I should review acute pharmacologic management for symptomatic bradycardia or hemodynamic compromise, but I need to be careful not to overstate indications. Atropine is reasonable to try for SND-associated bradycardia with symptoms or instability, recognizing it may be less effective in denervated hearts or intrinsic SND, so I should be prepared to escalate promptly if there is no response [^112SWohe] [^116cKxJk]. If atropine fails or is contraindicated, catecholamines such as isoproterenol, dopamine, dobutamine, or epinephrine can be considered to increase heart rate, ideally when coronary ischemia is unlikely or adequately treated, while balancing pro-ischemic risk and tachyarrhythmia potential [^1144zhGd]. But wait, what if the bradycardia is medication-induced from beta-blocker or calcium channel blocker toxicity? Then I should consider antidotes like glucagon for beta-blocker overdose and high-dose insulin therapy for beta-blocker or calcium channel blocker toxicity, alongside IV calcium for calcium channel blocker poisoning, and I should remember that atropine may still be tried but often fails in toxicologic bradycardia, necessitating early pacing or vasoactive support [^11174wAT] [^112F8Kxt] [^116LzV2E] [^112v2Lnq] [^116m1nrS] [^1116shSh]. For digoxin toxicity with bradycardia, I should confirm the indication for digoxin immune Fab when there is hemodynamic compromise or life-threatening toxicity, as this can reverse bradyarrhythmias by neutralizing digoxin [^114n8eox].

> I will now examine chronic pharmacologic strategies, but I need to emphasize their limitations upfront. Oral theophylline or aminophylline can be considered as a temporizing measure to increase sinus rate and improve symptoms, and it may help predict symptomatic benefit from pacing in select patients; however, efficacy is modest, adverse effects are common, and this is not a substitute for pacing when symptoms persist or tachy-brady physiology is present [^114KgQCC]. Let me verify special contexts where methylxanthines are particularly mentioned: acute spinal cord injury with SND and post–heart transplant bradycardia, where denervation physiology limits atropine responsiveness and theophylline may be more useful, though again this is supportive rather than definitive therapy [^115CyNsK] [^114AzkqD] [^1133CMht]. I should double-check that no chronic antiarrhythmic or chronotropic agent reliably restores physiologic sinoatrial node function in degenerative SND, reinforcing that pharmacotherapy is adjunctive at best [^114jyhDD].

> But wait, what if the patient has tachy-brady syndrome with intermittent atrial tachyarrhythmias and pauses? I need to ensure I don't conflate rate-control strategies for AF with treatment of SND itself. In tachy-brady presentations, permanent pacing addresses the bradycardia and pause physiology, while antiarrhythmic therapy for AF must be used cautiously because many agents further depress sinus node function; thus, pacing is often required before or alongside antiarrhythmics, and rhythm-control strategies may improve sinoatrial node function in some cases, though evidence is limited [^116DkoQi] [^113gbWr8] [^114XtWNW].

> I should confirm medication safety and contraindications so we avoid iatrogenic harm. Agents that depress sinus node function or AV conduction are generally contraindicated or require extreme caution in SND without a pacemaker, including non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, adenosine, and amiodarone, and labels for esmolol, diltiazem, and adenosine explicitly list sick sinus syndrome without a pacemaker as a contraindication, underscoring the risk of precipitating severe bradycardia or asystole [^117GJMKM] [^115sgqmB] [^1121VaeU] [^111haywH] [^113Z7XiB]. Hold on, I should verify that even when these drugs are clinically necessary, pacing may be indicated to permit their safe use, which is a recognized scenario in guideline frameworks for device therapy in bradyarrhythmias [^113gbWr8].

> Let me consider the definitive therapy so I don't overpromise on drugs. Permanent pacing remains the only effective long-term treatment for chronic, symptomatic SND, improving symptoms and quality of life without consistently reducing mortality, and device decisions should follow shared decision-making that incorporates patient goals, comorbidities, and pacing mode selection to minimize unnecessary ventricular pacing and mitigate pacemaker syndrome [^114jyhDD] [^112nBy1P] [^111SAsid] [^116qq9r6]. I should confirm that in patients who no longer require pacing, de-escalation can be considered with monitored evaluation, but this is the exception rather than the rule in degenerative SND [^112kQFED].

> Next, I should review a practical, stepwise approach and make sure it aligns with guidelines. First, stabilize and treat reversible causes, including holding offending drugs, correcting electrolytes and thyroid dysfunction, and managing ischemia or sleep apnea; second, if symptomatic or unstable, use atropine and catecholamines as appropriate while preparing for temporary pacing if refractory; third, consider theophylline as a bridge in select cases or when pacing is deferred, recognizing limited efficacy; fourth, for persistent symptomatic SND or tachy-brady physiology, proceed to permanent pacing with shared decision-making and mode selection that minimizes ventricular pacing; fifth, manage tachyarrhythmias only after pacing support is in place to avoid worsening bradycardia [^1125cjW8] [^112SWohe] [^1144zhGd] [^114KgQCC] [^114jyhDD] [^111SAsid].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought ivabradine might have a role in SND because it modulates sinus node activity, but I should correct that assumption. Ivabradine slows sinus rate and is indicated for inappropriate sinus tachycardia and selected heart failure populations, and it is contraindicated in sick sinus syndrome without a pacemaker, so it has no therapeutic role for treating bradycardia due to SND and could worsen it [^113Dg47H] [^113DagMx].

> Finally, I need to ensure the synthesis is coherent and safety-focused. Pharmacologic therapy in sick sinus syndrome is largely acute and supportive, centered on atropine, catecholamines, and antidotes for drug toxicity, with limited chronic benefit from theophylline as a bridge; definitive management is permanent pacing, and all drug choices must be filtered through contraindications and the presence or absence of a pacemaker to avoid precipitating severe bradycardia or asystole [^112SWohe] [^1144zhGd] [^114KgQCC] [^114jyhDD] [^117GJMKM] [^115sgqmB] [^1121VaeU] [^111haywH].

---

Pharmacologic therapy for sick sinus syndrome (SSS) is **limited and mainly adjunctive**, with **permanent pacing as the definitive treatment** for symptomatic patients [^115NJp8b] [^114jyhDD]. The primary pharmacologic options are **atropine for acute bradycardia** [^112SWohe] and **theophylline for chronic symptom relief** [^114KgQCC]; however, both have modest efficacy and significant adverse effects, so they are reserved for select cases or as bridges to pacing [^114KgQCC]. Beta-agonists (isoproterenol, dopamine, epinephrine) may be used short-term in emergencies, but they are not suitable for chronic management due to proarrhythmic and ischemic risks [^1144zhGd]. Medications that slow sinus node function — such as beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, and antiarrhythmics — are contraindicated or require caution unless pacing is in place [^111haywH] [^117GJMKM] [^115sgqmB]. Overall, **pharmacologic therapy is not a substitute for pacing** and should be individualized with shared decision-making [^112nBy1P].

## Pharmacologic management strategies

### Acute pharmacologic interventions

- **Atropine**: Consider for acute symptomatic bradycardia or hemodynamic compromise in SSS; increases sinus rate via vagal blockade but may be ineffective in intrinsic sinus node disease and can cause anticholinergic effects (dry mouth, blurred vision, urinary retention) [^112SWohe].

- **Beta-adrenergic agonists (isoproterenol, dopamine, epinephrine)**: Short-term use for acute bradycardia with hemodynamic compromise; increase heart rate via direct sympathetic stimulation but carry proarrhythmic and ischemic risks and are not for chronic use [^1144zhGd].

- **Glucagon**: Consider for bradycardia due to beta-blocker overdose; increases intracellular cAMP and heart rate but may cause hyperglycemia, vomiting, and hypotension [^11174wAT].

---

### Chronic pharmacologic interventions

- **Theophylline**: Consider for chronic symptomatic SSS to increase heart rate and improve symptoms; also used to assess potential pacing benefit. Limited efficacy and adverse effects (insomnia, tremor, gastrointestinal upset, arrhythmias) limit use [^114KgQCC].

- **Aminophylline**: Consider in specific settings (e.g. post–heart transplant, acute spinal cord injury) to increase heart rate; similar limitations and adverse effects apply [^114AzkqD] [^115CyNsK].

---

## Limitations and risks of pharmacologic therapy

- **Limited efficacy**: Pharmacologic therapy provides only modest symptom relief and does not address the underlying sinus node dysfunction [^114jyhDD].

- **Adverse effects**: Atropine and beta-agonists can cause significant adverse effects, limiting their chronic use [^notfound].

- **Contraindications**: Many medications (e.g. beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, antiarrhythmics) are contraindicated or require caution in SSS due to risk of worsening bradycardia [^111haywH] [^117GJMKM] [^115sgqmB].

---

## Comparison with permanent pacing

Permanent pacing is the **definitive therapy** for symptomatic SSS, providing sustained symptom relief and improved quality of life, though it does not reduce mortality [^114jyhDD] [^116swYga]. Pharmacologic therapy is **adjunctive**, offering temporary relief or serving as a bridge to pacing, and is not a substitute [^116E6yaG].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines emphasize:

- **Permanent pacing**: Recommended for symptomatic SSS, especially with tachy-brady syndrome or significant bradycardia [^115NJp8b].

- **Pharmacologic therapy**: Adjunctive only, for temporary relief or as a bridge to pacing [^notfound].

- **Shared decision-making**: Essential to align treatment with patient preferences and goals [^112nBy1P].

---

## Emerging pharmacologic therapies and research

Research into novel pharmacologic therapies for SSS is limited; no **significant breakthroughs** have emerged. Continued investigation is needed to identify targeted therapies addressing the underlying pathophysiology [^114n3fNc].

---

Pharmacologic therapy for SSS is **limited and adjunctive**, with permanent pacing as the definitive treatment. Atropine and beta-agonists are for acute use; theophylline may be used chronically in select cases. Many medications are contraindicated or require caution in SSS, and treatment should be individualized with shared decision-making.

### Sick sinus syndrome: a review [^115trHF2]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Sick sinus syndrome refers to a collection of disorders marked by the heart's inability to perform its pacemaking function. Predominantly affecting older adults, sick sinus syndrome comprises various arrhythmias, including bradyarrhythmias with or without accompanying tachyarrhythmias. At least 50 percent of patients with sick sinus syndrome develop alternating bradycardia and tachycardia, also known as tachy-brady syndrome. Sick sinus syndrome results from intrinsic causes, or may be exacerbated or mimicked by extrinsic factors. Intrinsic causes include degenerative fibrosis, ion channel dysfunction, and remodeling of the sinoatrial node. Extrinsic factors can be pharmacologic, metabolic, or autonomic. Signs and symptoms are often subtle early on and become more obvious as the disease progresses. They are commonly related to end-organ hypoperfusion. Cerebral hypoperfusion is most common, with syncope or near-fainting occurring in about one-half of patients. Diagnosis may be challenging, and is ultimately made by electrocardiographic identification of the arrhythmia in conjunction with the presence of symptoms. If electrocardiography does not yield a diagnosis, inpatient telemetry monitoring, outpatient Holter monitoring, event monitoring, or loop monitoring may be used. Electrophysiologic studies also may be used but are not routinely needed. Treatment of sick sinus syndrome includes removing extrinsic factors, when possible, and pacemaker placement. Pacemakers do not reduce mortality, but they can decrease symptoms and improve quality of life.

### Diagnosis and treatment of sick sinus syndrome [^111mgTkn]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Sick sinus syndrome comprises a variety of conditions involving sinus node dysfunction and commonly affects elderly persons. While the syndrome can have many causes, it usually is idiopathic. Patients may experience syncope, pre-syncope, palpitations, or dizziness; however, they often are asymptomatic or have subtle or nonspecific symptoms. Sick sinus syndrome has multiple manifestations on electrocardiogram, including sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest, sinoatrial block, and alternating patterns of bradycardia and tachycardia (bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome). Diagnosis of sick sinus syndrome can be difficult because of its nonspecific symptoms and elusive findings on electrocardiogram or Holter monitor. The mainstay of treatment is atrial or dual-chamber pacemaker placement, which generally provides effective relief of symptoms and lowers the incidence of atrial fibrillation, thromboembolic events, heart failure, and mortality, compared with ventricular pacemakers.

### Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic options to maintain sinus rhythm: guideline-based and new approaches [^114SqaYv]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmia in patients with heart failure and is responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality. Restoration and preservation of sinus rhythm, therefore, has a premium. Of the numerous treatment options available, many must be avoided because of their potential for adverse effects or because of limited proof of efficacy in defined populations. Published guidelines provide help by synthesizing clinical trial data into a recommended approach. This article summarizes current information regarding the best methods applicable to patients with left ventricular dysfunction for rate control, sinus rhythm restoration and maintenance, and stroke prevention. New and evolving therapies and how they might fit into the evolving treatment paradigm are also briefly reviewed.

### Sick sinus syndrome associated with anti-programmed cell death-1 [^1173sDi2]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4, and programmed cell death protein (PD-1) are emerging as forceful weapons against various tumors, including melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, lung cancer, and bladder cancer. However, due to the immunomodulatory nature of immune checkpoint inhibitors, a new spectrum of immune-related adverse events (irAE) associated with checkpoint inhibitors, anti-CTLA4 antibody and anti-PD-1 antibody has been recognized.

Some types of irAE, such as pneumonitis, hepatitis, and cardiac toxicities, are life-threatening and need to be diagnosed immediately. Among these irAE, immune-related cardiac toxicities have been highlighted recently. Dysrhythmia, one form of cardiac toxicity, may present with myocarditis. However, sick sinus syndrome following anti-PD-1 treatment has not been reported.

The endocrine organs typically affected by irAE are the pituitary, thyroid and adrenal glands, and the manifestations are hypophysitis, isolated secondary adrenal insufficiency, hyper−/hypothyroidism and primary adrenal insufficiency. Overall incidence of irAE is approximately 10%, but this varies among different endocrinopathies and treatment agents. The irAE of adrenal insufficiency typically presents with fatigue and hypotension, but rarely with dysrhythmia. Here, we present the first reported case of sick sinus syndrome associated with anti-PD-1 treatment.

For patients needing atrial support, "Newly developed atrial-based minimal ventricular pacing modes are recommended as an alternative to conventional DDDR (dual chamber rate-adaptive pacemaker) pacing". Medication management is emphasized: "Elimination of drugs that may exacerbate or unmask underlying susceptibility to bradycardia is an important element", and "when substitution is not feasible, cardiac pacing may be necessary". Ablation for tachyarrhythmia control in sick sinus syndrome is noted but "only infrequently used primarily for prevention of syncope".

### Sick sinus syndrome associated with anti-programmed cell death-1 [^116scVsf]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Use of anti-programmed cell death-1 (anti-PD-1) has been successful in treating many types of cancers. Despite its promising efficacy, immune-related adverse events are still a major concern. Immune-related cardiotoxicity, which is rare but fatal, has recently become a focus of attention. Cardiotoxicities including myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, cardiac fibrosis, heart block and cardiac arrest have been reported. Of these toxicities, myocarditis is often accompanied by dysrhythmia. The presentation of sick sinus syndrome as an immune-related adverse event has not yet been reported. Here, we reported the first case of sick sinus syndrome, a rare toxicity induced by anti-PD-1.

Case presentation

A 42-year-old male patient who had metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma failed treatment with sorafenib. Pembrolizumab at a fixed dose of 100 mg every three weeks was given. His heart rate gradually slowed down and he presented sick sinus syndrome with a lowest heart rate of 38 bpm after six cycles of pembrolizumab. He denied chest tightness, cold sweating, palpitation and dyspnea. Lab data including cardiac enzyme, electrolytes and thyroid function were all within a normal range. Simultaneously, he complained of fatigue, dizziness and anorexia with hypotension. Lab data revealed low cortisol and ACTH levels. Anti-PD-1 induced adrenal insufficiency was suspected. Low-dose cortisone (12.5 mg) was prescribed, and the patient's symptoms, hypotension and sick sinus syndrome showed rapid improvement. Cortisone was gradually titrated and discontinued three weeks later. His sick sinus syndrome did not relapse and the cortisol and ACTH level returned to normal.

Conclusions

Sick sinus syndrome caused by anti-PD-1 treatment is a rare adverse event. With the development of sick sinus syndrome, myocarditis should be the first differential diagnosis because of its lethality. From this case, we learned that sick sinus syndrome may be a presentation of immune- or adrenal insufficiency-mediated sinus node dysfunction, both could be reversed with a glucocorticoid supplement.

Vasovagal syncope — natural history and treatment framing — is generally benign with clusters of syncopes interspersed with long quiescent periods without recurrences; younger and older individuals differ markedly, with the latter group more likely to have complicating comorbidities and medical therapies; despite the apparently benign profile, patients with frequent episodes occasionally need treatment, and when considering therapy it is important to weigh the natural history, potential for harm, and the marked reduction in syncope seen in all control arms of randomized trials against symptom severity and overall likelihood of treatment efficacy.

2.1. Bradycardia and Conduction Disorders — Bradycardia and conduction abnormalities are more commonly identified in the elderly. Sinus node dysfunction (SND), historically referred to as sick sinus syndrome, is most often related to age- dependent, progressive, degenerative fibrosis of the sinus nodal tissue and surrounding atrial myocardium, which can result in abnormalities of sinus node and atrial impulse formation and propagation and be associated with various bradycardia or pause-related syndromes. Data from permanent pacemaker studies and large cohorts suggest that SND is most common in individuals who are in their 70s or 80s.

### Sick sinus syndrome associated with anti-programmed cell death-1 [^1176BJwu]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Two important differential diagnosis of this patient include immune-mediated and adrenal insufficiency-induced sinus node dysfunction. The limitation is that it would be difficult to prove the autoimmunity of sinus node induced by anti-PD-1 treatment. Tracing his medical records, his sinus bradycardia gradually progressed, whereas hypotension and low cortisol level did not developed until six cycles of pembrolizumab. Hence, immune- mediated sick sinus syndrome may be more likely. On the other hand, ACTH stimulation test that is useful to establish the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency was not performed in this case.

Sick sinus syndrome is a rare toxicity caused by anti-PD-1. Cardiac toxicities such as myocarditis should always be considered first, due to the fatal outcome. Endocrine disorders including dysfunction of the pituitary, thyroid and adrenal glands should also be differentiated. Steroids could be the treatment choice based on the experience from this case.

Cholinesterase inhibitors — adverse effects and precautions in Alzheimer's disease include cholinergic symptoms such as nausea and vomiting that tend to be mild to moderate, with randomized clinical trials observing these side effects in approximately 10%–20% of patients, and cholinergic side effects tend to wane within 2–4 days. Additional effects include muscle cramps; bradycardia, decreased appetite and weight, and increased gastrointestinal acid; these side effects occur infrequently, but bradycardia should be considered a relative contraindication to their use. The main contraindication to use is hypersensitivity to the individual drugs. Considerations in limiting treatment include gastrointestinal disorders such as gastritis, ulcerative disease, or undiagnosed nausea and vomiting because these drugs will increase gastric acid secretions, and cholinesterase inhibitors should also be used with care in patients with sick sinus syndrome or conduction defects, cerebrovascular disease, or seizures, as well as in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

### Real-world evidence on disparities on the initiation of ticagrelor versus prasugrel in patients with acute coronary syndrome [^115prjCB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Findings from the recent ISAR‐REACT 5 (Intracoronary Stenting and Antithrombotic Regimen: Rapid Early Action for Coronary Treatment) trialshowed more effective reduction of incident myocardial infarction without an excess of major bleeding complications, stimulating a recommendation of the 2020 European Society of Cardiology guidelines on the management of non–ST‐segment–elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE‐ACS) favoring prasugrel over ticagrelor. However, shortcomings of this randomized open‐label trial stimulated a debate on the validity of this recommendation. Due to remaining uncertainties, the 2021 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guideline on myocardial revascularization did not adopt the preferential use of prasugrel but continues to recommend the preferential use of either a potent oral antiplatelet agent over clopidogrel and refrains to comment on the ISAR‐REACT 5 trial. Importantly, the differential use of either the reversible P 2 Y 12 inhibitor ticagrelor or the irreversible P 2 Y 12 inhibitor prasugrel has to consider warnings and label restrictions, which include age ≥ 75 years, body weight < 60 kg, or a history of transient ischemic attack (TIA)/stroke for prasugrel, and severe asthma, a history of sick sinus syndrome without pacemaker, or coadministration of a potent cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitor for ticagrelor. Although rates for exclusion from randomized controlled trials are at least 16%or 30%for prasugrel, sparse information is available for factors that disqualify ticagrelor, and there is sparse information from all‐comer registries represented in real‐world evidence. Our current analysis aims to identify numbers of patients who qualify for either aspirin plus ticagrelor or aspirin plus prasugrel, using an existing all‐comer registry on patients with confirmed acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

Accordingly, our primary objective was to compare the eligibility of patients with confirmed ACS for a dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) regimen with ticagrelor versus prasugrel, along with low‐dose aspirin, and to assess the reasons for noneligibility for the full dose and reduced dose of prasugrel or for ticagrelor in patients with either ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or NSTE‐ACS.

National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines — Diltiazem is a calcium channel blocker and antidysrhythmic type IV indicated for management of narrow complex tachycardias. Pharmacologic actions include inhibition of extracellular calcium ion influx across myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes, reducing cardiac and vascular smooth muscle contraction and dilating main coronary and systemic arteries; it has no effect on serum calcium concentrations and exerts substantial inhibitory effects on the cardiac conduction system acting principally at the AV node, with some effects at the sinus node. Contraindications include documented hypersensitivity, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, Lown-Ganong-Levine syndrome, symptomatic severe hypotension (systolic BP less than 90 mmHg), sick sinus syndrome (if no pacemaker), second- and third-degree heart block (if no pacemaker present), and complete heart block; for IV administration, contraindications include use in newborns (because of benzyl alcohol), concomitant beta-blocker therapy, cardiogenic shock, and ventricular tachycardia (must determine whether origin is supraventricular or ventricular).

Cardiovascular bradycardia — EMS key considerations include observing for decreased end-organ perfusion signs such as chest pain, shortness of breath, decreased level of consciousness, syncope, or other signs of shock/hypotension. Patients who have undergone cardiac transplant will not respond to atropine. Consider potential culprit medications including beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, sodium channel blockers/anti-depressants, digoxin, and clonidine, and consider hyperkalemia in the patient with wide complex bradycardia. The differential diagnosis includes myocardial infarction, hypoxia, pacemaker failure, hypothermia, sinus bradycardia, athletes, head injury with increased intracranial pressure, stroke, spinal cord lesion, sick sinus syndrome, AV blocks, overdose, and cholinergic nerve agents. Bradycardia should be managed via the least invasive manner possible, escalating care as needed. Third-degree heart block or the denervated heart (as in cardiac transplant) may not respond to atropine and in these cases, proceed quickly to chronotropic agents (such as epinephrine or dopamine) or transcutaneous pacing. Dopamine is not indicated for pediatric patients. Be aware of acute coronary syndrome as a cause of bradycardia in adult patients. When dosing medications for pediatric patients, dose should be weight-based for non-obese patients and based on ideal body weight for obese patients. Although dopamine is often recommended for the treatment of symptomatic bradycardia, recent research suggests that patients in cardiogenic or septic shock treated with norepinephrine have a lower mortality rate compared to those treated with dopamine. Caution: Norepinephrine can theoretically cause reflex bradycardia.

### Incidence of and risk factors for sick sinus syndrome in the general population [^116g16mT]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Little is known about the incidence of and risk factors for sick sinus syndrome (SSS), a common indication for pacemaker implantation.

Objectives

This study sought to describe the epidemiology of SSS.

Methods

This analysis included 20,572 participants (mean baseline age 59 years, 43% male) in the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities) study and the CHS (Cardiovascular Health Study), who at baseline were free of prevalent atrial fibrillation and pacemaker therapy, had a heart rate of ≥ 50 beats/min unless using beta blockers, and were identified as of white or black race. Incident SSS cases were identified by hospital discharge International Classification of Disease-revision 9-Clinical Modification code 427.81 and validated by medical record review.

Results

During an average 17 years of follow-up, 291 incident SSS cases were identified (unadjusted rate 0.8 per 1,000 person-years). Incidence increased with age (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.47 to 2.05 per 5-year increment), and blacks had a 41% lower risk of SSS than whites (HR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.37 to 0.98). Incident SSS was associated with greater baseline body mass index, height, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, and cystatin C, with longer QRS interval, with lower heart rate, and with prevalent hypertension, right bundle branch block, and cardiovascular disease. We project that the annual number of new SSS cases in the United States will increase from 78,000 in 2012 to 172,000 in 2060.

Conclusions

Blacks have a lower risk of SSS than whites, and several cardiovascular risk factors were associated with incident SSS. With the aging of the population, the number of Americans with SSS will increase dramatically over the next 50 years.

### Genetic insight into sick sinus syndrome [^114n3fNc]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sick sinus syndrome (SSS) is a complex cardiac arrhythmia and the leading indication for permanent pacemaker implantation worldwide. It is characterized by pathological sinus bradycardia, sinoatrial block, or alternating atrial brady- and tachyarrhythmias. Symptoms include fatigue, reduced exercise capacity, and syncope. Few studies have been conducted on the basic mechanisms of SSS and therapeutic limitations reflect an incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology. No specific treatment option is aimed at underlying pathways and trying to determine who benefits from cardiac pacing can be challenging. A better understanding of mechanisms leading to SSS is crucial for improvements in treatment and prevention and genetic studies provide an opportunity to gain such insight.

Coding variants in several genes, including HCN4, SCN5A, and GNB2, have been implicated in rare familial SSS through linkage analysis and candidate gene methods. In the only published genome-wide association study (GWAS) of SSS to date, we identified a strong association with a missense variant in MYH6, encoding the alpha-heavy chain subunit of cardiac myosin. This was the first GWAS discovery implicating a cardiac structural or contractile unit as a primary cause of arrhythmia.

Age is the strongest risk factor for SSS, potentially reflecting degenerative fibrosis and electrical remodelling of the SA node and the atria in general.SSS often coexists with the more common atrial fibrillation (AF)and the two arrhythmias are thought to predispose to each other. We have previously examined the role of AF in SSS development through Mendelian randomization, a method using sequence variants associated with a risk factor (AF) as unbiased proxy indicators to determine whether the risk factor can cause a disease (SSS). The study supported causality, likely mediated through atrial remodelling. Several other traits have been associated with SSS while the nature of the associations has not been ascertained. These include body mass index (BMI), height, heart rate, and cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke.

To gain insight into the pathogenesis of SSS, we performed a large GWAS of over 6000 cases and one million controls of European descent. We used polygenic scores (PGSs) and Mendelian randomization to determine the nature of the associations of risk factors with SSS and in particular whether they contribute to the cause of the disease.

Sinus node dysfunction (SND) epidemiology and pathophysiology — SND, historically referred to as sick sinus syndrome, is most often related to age-dependent, progressive, degenerative fibrosis of the sinus nodal tissue and surrounding atrial myocardium, leading to abnormalities of impulse formation/propagation and bradycardia or pause-related syndromes; atrial arrhythmias can coexist with sinus node disease in the "tachy-brady syndrome". There is evidence that heart block occurs in a portion of patients who have required permanent atrial pacing for SND, suggesting fibrotic involvement of the specialized atrioventricular conduction system. Data from permanent pacemaker studies and large cohorts suggest that SND is most common in individuals who are in their 70s or 80s, and common concurrent issues include ischemic heart disease, heart failure, valvular heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and atrial fibrillation. Intrinsic sinus or atrioventricular nodal disease can present similarly to extrinsic/secondary processes (e.g., myocardial ischemia or infarction, infiltrative diseases, collagen vascular disease, surgical trauma, endocrine abnormalities, autonomic effects, neuromuscular disorders) that compromise impulse initiation and propagation, and whether intrinsic or extrinsic, the clinical manifestations can be identical.

### 2015 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline for the management of adult patients with supraventricular tachycardia: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^113Dg47H]. Heart Rhythm (2016). Medium credibility.

Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) — pharmacologic considerations state that "lowering the heart rate may not alleviate symptoms", and "Therapy with beta blockers or calcium channel blockers is often ineffective or not well tolerated because of cardiovascular side effects, such as hypotension". Ivabradine, an inhibitor of the "If" channel that "reduces the sinus node pacemaker activity, which results in slowing of the heart rate", was "recently approved by the FDA for use in patients with systolic heart failure" based on "2 large, randomized, placebo-controlled trials", which included patients with "a left ventricular ejection fraction < 40%" or "a left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 35%", and in which "therapy with ivabradine resulted in additional heart rate reductions of 6 to 8 bpm" with "no other hemodynamic effects aside from lowering the heart rate"; it "has been investigated for use to reduce the sinus rate and improve symptomatic status related to IST".

### Heart rate reduction decreases central blood pressure in sick sinus syndrome patients with a permanent cardiac pacemaker [^111atkLK]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Increased resting heart rate (HR) contributes to higher cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in the healthy as well as in people with cardiovascular diseases, possibly due to elevated blood pressure (BP) among other mechanisms. Data on the relationship between HR and central (aortic) BP remains controversial, however, and concerning β-blockers, it has been proposed that pharmacological HR lowering is associated with augmentation of central BP. We aimed to study the role of pharmacologically unaffected HR on central BP indices in sick sinus syndrome patients with a permanent cardiac pacemaker in the HR range from 40 to 90 bpm. We included 27 subjects (mean age 65.8 ± 9.5 years, 12 men) with a dual-chamber pacemaker implanted due to sick sinus syndrome. We determined central hemodynamic indices noninvasively during an atrial pacing mode at low (40 bpm), middle (60 bpm), and high (90 bpm) HR levels with an oscillometric cuff-based device (Sphygmocor XCEL). There was no difference in central systolic BP at the middle versus the high HR level (mean 121.2 ± 13.0 and 121.2 ± 12.1mmHg, respectively, P = 0.9), but at the low HR level, it was significantly lower than at the middle HR level (mean 117.2 ± 13.1 and 121.2 ± 13.0mmHg, P < 0.01). Our acute study provides evidence to suggest that at a HR of < 60 bpm, sick sinus syndrome patients may have a lower central BP than at a higher HR, despite the proposed augmenting effects of low HR on central BP.

Fig. 2
Serial vital signs and hormone levels following anti-PD-1 treatment. Heart rate (HR) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) dropped after six cycles of pembrolizumab (P) treatment. Cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels declined, but thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free T4 (fT4) remained within a normal range. HR and SBP were reversed after prescription of cortisone. Cortisol and ACTH levels returned to a normal range about one month later

Backtracking his medical records, his HR gradually slowed down while the systolic pressure and cortisol level remained normal. Both immune-mediated sinoatrial node dysfunction and adrenal insufficiency were suspected. Since systemic steroids could treat both irAEs, a low dose of cortisone (12.5 mg) was prescribed orally once daily. His symptoms, bradycardia and hypotension improved immediately after one dose of cortisone. Three weeks later, cortisone was discontinued without symptoms relapse. Pembrolizumab was also discontinued due to the progressive status of his HCC.

### Cardiac pacing: the state of the art [^114jyhDD]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Permanent cardiac pacing remains the only effective treatment for chronic, symptomatic bradycardia. In recent years, the role of implantable pacing devices has expanded substantially. At the beginning of the 21st century, exciting developments in technology seem to happen at an exponential rate. Major advances have extended the use of pacing beyond the arrhythmia horizon. Such developments include dual-chamber pacers, rate-response algorithms, improved functionality of implantable cardioverter defibrillators, combinations of sensors for optimum physiological response, and advances in lead placement and extraction. Cardiac pacing is poised to help millions of patients worldwide to live better electrically. We review pacing studies of sick-sinus syndrome, neurocardiogenic syncope, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, and cardiac resynchronisation therapy, which are common or controversial indications for cardiac pacing. We also look at the benefits and complications of implantation in specific arrhythmias, suitability of different pacing modes, and the role of permanent pacing in the management of patients with heart failure.

### Profound bradycardia with lidocaine during anesthesia induction in a silent sick sinus syndrome patient [^112tJMJb]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

Sick sinus syndrome is caused by sinus node dysfunction that renders it unable to function as a pacemaker. Patients with sick sinus syndrome are often asymptomatic or have symptoms that are mild and nonspecific. Lidocaine (0.5 mg/kg) injection is used for reduction of pain associated with intravenous injection of propofol. Episodes of marked bradycardia with sinus arrest after prophylactic lidocaine injection are reported in a 69-y-old man with no apparent preoperative cardiac disease or electrocardiographic abnormality. Surgery was postponed, and he was later diagnosed with sick sinus syndrome.

Tachy-brady syndrome in symptomatic sinus node dysfunction (SND) — patients have periods of fast heart rates (usually atrial fibrillation) and slow sinus rates or pauses, with one of the most disabling symptoms being recurrent syncope or presyncope secondary to transient asystolic pause after termination of paroxysmal atrial tachyarrhythmia; no randomized trial has specifically examined permanent cardiac pacing in tachy-brady syndrome; permanent pacing can alleviate symptoms attributable to bradycardia or allow use of medications that might exacerbate bradycardia, and when bradycardia is associated with the atrial arrhythmia (AF with slow ventricular rates or post conversion pauses), ablation may obviate the requirement for permanent pacing.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Acute management of SND — reversible causes recommends that in symptomatic patients presenting with SND, evaluation and treatment of reversible causes is recommended. Most patients with SND present with chronic complaints that do not require acute treatment, and most causes of SND are chronic and irreversible, although sinus bradyarrhythmias are attributable to potentially reversible causes such as acute MI, atrial tachyarrhythmias, electrolyte abnormalities, hypothyroidism, medications, infections, and metabolic abnormalities. Because patients are typically stable and minimally symptomatic on presentation with SND, no acute therapy is usually required and evaluation of SND and assessment for potentially reversible causes can be performed in an outpatient setting. In some cases, although evaluation of reversible causes for SND should be undertaken, treatment may not be necessary, for example stopping a beta blocker in an asymptomatic patient with sinus bradycardia after ST-elevation MI, and some patients with tachy-brady syndrome may have improvement of sinoatrial node function after treatment aimed at maintaining sinus rhythm.

### Diltiazem hci [^117GJMKM]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

Injectable forms of diltiazem are contraindicated in:

Patients with sick sinus syndrome except in the presence of a functioning ventricular pacemaker.

Patients with second- or third-degree AV block except in the presence of a functioning ventricular pacemaker.

Patients with severe hypotension or cardiogenic shock.

Patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug.

Intravenous diltiazem and intravenous beta-blockers should not be administered together or in close proximity (within a few hours).

Patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter associated with an accessory bypass tract such as in WPW syndrome or short PR syndrome.

As with other agents which slow AV nodal conduction and do not prolong the refractoriness of the accessory pathway (e.g., verapamil, digoxin), in rare instances patients in atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter associated with an accessory bypass tract may experience a potentially life-threatening increase in heart rate accompanied by hypotension when treated with injectable forms of diltiazem. As such, the initial use of injectable forms of diltiazem should be, if possible, in a setting where monitoring and resuscitation capabilities, including DC cardioversion/defibrillation, are present (see OVERDOSAGE). Once familiarity of the patient's response is established, use in an office setting may be acceptable.

Patients with ventricular tachycardia. Administration of other calcium channel blockers to patients with wide complex tachycardia (QRS ≥ 0.12 seconds) has resulted in hemodynamic deterioration and ventricular fibrillation. It is important that an accurate pretreatment diagnosis distinguish wide complex QRS tachycardia of supraventricular origin from that of ventricular origin prior to administration of injectable forms of diltiazem.

### Dual-site atrial pacing for atrial fibrillation in patients without bradycardia [^115fBRiT]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Atrial pacing has been shown to delay the onset of atrial fibrillation (AF) when compared with ventricular pacing in patients with sick sinus syndrome. The role for pacing in the control of AF in patients without bradycardia is uncertain. We performed a randomized, crossover, single-blinded study in 22 patients (14 women, aged 63 ± 10 years) with paroxysmal AF refractory to treatment with oral sotalol (202 ± 68 mg/day) and no bradycardic indication for pacing. All patients received a dual-chamber pacemaker with 2 atrial pacing leads positioned at the high right atrium and coronary sinus ostium, respectively. Patients were randomized in a crossover fashion to be paced for 12 weeks, either with high right atrial (RA) pacing at 30 beats/min ("Off") or dual-site RA pacing with an overdrive algorithm that maintained atrial pacing at a rate slightly above the sinus rate ("On"). Treatment on resulted in a significantly higher percentage of atrial pacing and a reduction in atrial ectopic frequency than the treatment off period. The time to the first clinical AF recurrence was prolonged (15 ± 17 to 50 ± 35 days, p = 0.006), and total AF burden was reduced (45 ± 34% vs 22 ± 29%, p = 0.04) in the on-treatment phase. However, there was no difference in AF checklist symptom scores or overall quality-of-life measures. Dual-site RA pacing with continued sinus overdrive prolonged the time to AF recurrence and decreased AF burden in patients with paroxysmal AF. The absence of a major impact on symptom control suggests that pacing should be used as an adjunctive therapy with other treatment modalities for AF.
