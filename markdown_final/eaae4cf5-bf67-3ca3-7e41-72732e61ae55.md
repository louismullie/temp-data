## Question

When to consider heparin bridging on those warfarin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to consider heparin bridging in patients on warfarin who require temporary interruption for a procedure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's indication for warfarin and their thromboembolic risk category. Then, I should verify the procedural bleeding risk and whether warfarin truly needs to be interrupted. Next, I will review the highest-quality evidence, especially randomized trials and contemporary guidelines, to decide whether bridging reduces thrombosis without excess bleeding. Finally, I will outline practical dosing, timing, and exceptions where bridging may still be reasonable despite the general recommendation against it.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: most patients on warfarin who need a procedure fall into one of three indication groups — atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism, or mechanical heart valves — and the decision to bridge hinges on balancing thromboembolic risk against bleeding risk during the interruption window, which is typically 5 days for warfarin given its long half-life [^92179f97] [^385ce564].

> I will now examine atrial fibrillation, where the evidence is strongest. The BRIDGE randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial showed that forgoing LMWH bridging was noninferior to bridging for arterial thromboembolism and significantly reduced major bleeding, with thromboembolism 0.4% vs 0.3% and major bleeding 1.3% vs 3.2%, respectively [^9807dc2a]. Wait, let me verify guideline alignment: contemporary ACC/AHA/ACCP guidance issues a strong recommendation against bridging in AF patients undergoing elective procedures, except those with mechanical valves or recent stroke/TIA, reflecting this harm signal and lack of efficacy benefit [^e75b6b41] [^a5d512db]. Hold on, I should also note that meta-analyses corroborate increased bleeding without reduced thromboembolism when bridging is used in AF populations, reinforcing the practice change away from routine bridging [^29629f0d] [^fc8a9f6c].

> Next, I should review venous thromboembolism as the sole indication. The ACCP 2022 guideline suggests against therapeutic-dose heparin bridging for VTE patients requiring VKA interruption, citing observational data showing more bleeding and no reduction in recurrent VTE; for example, any bleeding 3.9% with bridging vs 0.4% without, and similar VTE recurrence rates, with the caveat that very high-risk VTE scenarios may warrant selective postoperative prophylaxis rather than full-dose bridging [^f41b518f]. Let me reconsider whether any subgroup benefits: the guideline allows that in selected high-risk VTE cases — recent event within 3 months, active cancer, or severe thrombophilia — pre- and/or post-operative heparin may be considered, but this is conditional and evidence is low quality, so I need to ensure we individualize and avoid reflex bridging [^f41b518f].

> For mechanical heart valves, I initially thought bridging was broadly indicated, but wait, I should double-check the nuance here. ACCP 2022 suggests against routine bridging even in many mechanical valve patients, reflecting evolving evidence and the lack of high-quality comparative data; exceptions include mitral mechanical valves, older-generation valves, or multiple risk factors where some guidelines still consider bridging reasonable, and this remains an area of controversy and shared decision-making with cardiology [^36aa1a32] [^a1b03dd0]. I need to ensure I communicate that bileaflet aortic valves without other risk factors are particularly low risk and often do not require bridging, whereas mitral-position valves carry higher thrombotic risk and may justify bridging in select cases after multidisciplinary review [^a1b03dd0] [^79f2eef0].

> Let me think about procedure-related factors that modify risk. Minor procedures with low bleeding risk — such as dental work, cataract surgery, many dermatologic procedures, and some endoscopies without polypectomy — generally do not require warfarin interruption, so bridging is moot in those scenarios; conversely, major surgeries with high bleeding risk may necessitate interruption, but that still does not automatically mandate bridging unless the thrombotic risk is very high [^36aa1a32] [^51f5ce31]. Hold on, I should verify device procedures: for pacemaker or ICD implantation, continued warfarin is preferred over interruption with bridging to reduce pocket hematoma, and this is a strong recommendation in ACCP 2022, which I should apply consistently [^36aa1a32].

> I need to check dosing and timing if bridging is actually indicated despite the general stance. Typical LMWH bridging uses therapeutic doses such as enoxaparin 1 mg/kg twice daily or dalteparin 100 IU/kg twice daily, with the last preoperative dose given about 24 hours before the procedure to mitigate bleeding risk; postoperatively, the first dose is generally delayed at least 24 hours after low-to-moderate bleeding risk procedures and 48–72 hours after high bleeding risk procedures, with resumption of warfarin within 24 hours once hemostasis is secure [^4b651739] [^2463f2b7] [^93746bde]. For UFH, I should confirm that infusions are stopped 4–6 hours pre-procedure and restarted postoperatively once hemostasis allows, with intensity targets individualized to renal function and bleeding risk [^a1b03dd0].

> But wait, what if the patient is starting warfarin rather than interrupting it? Observational data suggest that routine heparin bridging during VKA initiation in nonvalvular AF increases bleeding without reducing stroke, so I should avoid routine bridging in that context and reserve it for specific high-risk scenarios or alternative indications like acute VTE treatment starts where short-course parenteral therapy is standard [^e10f9e57] [^4fec9bd1] [^efc160e1]. I should double-check that this principle aligns with outpatient initiation practices, which increasingly favor no bridging unless a compelling indication exists [^e10f9e57].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. First, classify the thromboembolic risk: high risk includes mechanical mitral valves, recent VTE within 3 months, active cancer, severe thrombophilia, or AF with very high CHA2DS2-VASc and recent stroke/TIA; moderate risk includes AF with CHA2DS2-VASc 2–4 without recent events; low risk includes AF with CHA2DS2-VASc 0–1, remote VTE without ongoing drivers, or bileaflet aortic valves without other risk factors. Then, assess procedural bleeding risk and whether warfarin must be held. Finally, apply the evidence: avoid bridging for most AF and VTE patients, consider bridging selectively for mechanical valves in higher-risk configurations or for exceptional VTE scenarios after multidisciplinary review, and always tailor postoperative resumption to achieved hemostasis [^e75b6b41] [^f41b518f] [^a1b03dd0].

> In summary, I should confirm that routine heparin bridging during warfarin interruption is largely unsupported and often harmful across common indications, with strong recommendations against bridging in AF and conditional suggestions against bridging in VTE, while mechanical valves remain the most controversial area requiring individualized decisions and coordination with cardiology; when bridging is used, employ therapeutic-dose LMWH with careful pre- and postoperative timing to minimize bleeding, and default to no bridging in the absence of a compelling, high-risk indication [^e75b6b41] [^f41b518f] [^36aa1a32] [^4b651739].

Heparin bridging is **not routine** for warfarin interruption; it is reserved for patients at **high thromboembolic risk** [^2aaf2b13] (mechanical heart valves, recent VTE, or AF with very high stroke risk) [^46352142] when warfarin must be held for procedures. Bridging is **not recommended** for low-to-moderate risk patients [^c20951a9] because it increases bleeding without reducing thromboembolism [^9807dc2a] [^29629f0d]. If used, start LMWH when INR falls below therapeutic, stop 24 hours pre-procedure, and resume 24–72 hours post-procedure once hemostasis is secured [^2463f2b7] [^c2bc2c6a].

## Indications for heparin bridging

Heparin bridging is indicated for patients on warfarin who are at **high risk of thromboembolism** and require temporary interruption for procedures [^2aaf2b13]. High-risk conditions include:

- **Mechanical heart valves**: Especially mitral valves or older-generation valves [^a1b03dd0] [^79f2eef0].
- **Recent venous thromboembolism (VTE)**: Within 3 months [^f41b518f] [^c23db78a].
- **Atrial fibrillation (AF) with very high stroke risk**: CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 7 or recent stroke/TIA [^09cdfd2b] [^46352142].

---

## Situations where bridging is not recommended

Bridging is **not recommended** for patients at low-to-moderate thromboembolic risk because it increases bleeding without reducing thromboembolic events [^9807dc2a] [^29629f0d]. These include:

- **AF without mechanical valves**: Most patients with AF do not require bridging [^e75b6b41] [^a5d512db].
- **Stable VTE**: Remote VTE (> 3 months) without active cancer or thrombophilia [^f41b518f] [^c23db78a].
- **Low-risk procedures**: Minor procedures where warfarin can be continued [^36aa1a32] [^e83776f1].

---

## Risks and benefits of heparin bridging

### Benefits

Potential benefits include **reduced thromboembolism** in high-risk patients by maintaining anticoagulation during warfarin interruption [^2aaf2b13].

---

### Risks

Risks include **increased bleeding** [^9807dc2a], including major bleeding, which can delay surgery, prolong hospitalization, and increase morbidity [^29629f0d] [^4b651739].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **BRIDGE trial**: In AF patients, no bridging was noninferior to LMWH for thromboembolism and reduced major bleeding (1.3% vs 3.2%) [^9807dc2a].
- **ACCP 2022**: Recommends against routine bridging for AF and VTE; use only in high-risk patients [^36aa1a32] [^f41b518f].
- **ACC/AHA 2024**: Recommends no bridging for AF except with mechanical valves or recent stroke/TIA [^e75b6b41] [^a5d512db].

## Practical approach to heparin bridging

| **Step** | **Action** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Assess thromboembolic and bleeding risk [^92179f97] |
| 2 | Decide on bridging based on risk stratification [^2aaf2b13] |
| 3 | If bridging, start LMWH when INR < therapeutic [^c23db78a] |
| 4 | Stop LMWH 24 hours pre-procedure [^2463f2b7] |
| 5 | Resume LMWH 24–72 hours post-procedure once hemostasis is secured [^c2bc2c6a] |

---

## Special considerations

- **Mechanical heart valves**: Individualize bridging; mitral valves or older valves often need bridging [^a1b03dd0] [^79f2eef0].
- **Renal impairment**: Use UFH if CrCl < 30 mL/min [^4b651739].
- **Device procedures**: Continued warfarin is preferred over bridging to reduce pocket hematoma [^36aa1a32] [^82b180bc].

---

Heparin bridging is **selectively used** for high-risk patients who must interrupt warfarin, balancing thromboembolic benefit against bleeding risk. It is **not routine** and should be avoided in low-to-moderate risk patients.

### Bridging anticoagulation: primum non nocere [^0618a6c8]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic oral anticoagulation frequently requires interruption for various reasons and durations. Whether or not to bridge with heparin or other anticoagulants is a common clinical dilemma. The evidence to inform decision making is limited, making current guidelines equivocal and imprecise. Moreover, indications for anticoagulation interruption may be unclear. New observational studies and a recent large randomized trial have noted significant perioperative or periprocedural bleeding rates without reduction in thromboembolism when bridging is employed. Such bleeding may also increase morbidity and mortality. In light of these findings, physician preferences for routine bridging anticoagulation during chronic anticoagulation interruptions may be too aggressive. More randomized trials, such as PERIOP2 (A Double Blind Randomized Control Trial of Post-Operative Low Molecular Weight Heparin Bridging Therapy Versus Placebo Bridging Therapy for Patients Who Are at High Risk for Arterial Thromboembolism), will help guide periprocedural management of anticoagulation for indications such as venous thromboembolism and mechanical heart valves. In the meantime, physicians should carefully consider both the need for oral anticoagulation interruption and the practice of routine bridging when anticoagulation interruption is indicated.

### The BRIDGE trial: what the hospitalist should know [^ba276a84]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation patients often require warfarin interruption for an invasive procedure or surgery. Heparin bridging therapy has been frequently used during warfarin interruption under the premise of providing a theoretical mitigation against thromboembolism that overweighs expected higher rates of bleeding. Up until recently, little definite clinical evidence was available to guide the hospitalist on optimal perioperative anticoagulant management. The landmark BRIDGE (Perioperative Bridging Anticoagulation in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation) trial provided high-quality evidence that a simple interruption of warfarin in the average atrial fibrillation patient undergoing an elective procedure or surgery is noninferior to bridging therapy for efficacy and superior to bridging therapy in preventing major bleeding. To guide the hospitalist, we propose a treatment algorithm based on these recent data. We review the literature that led to the trial and highlight its practice-changing implications as a proof of concept that calls to question the premise of heparin bridging therapy beyond the atrial fibrillation population.

Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) bridging — postoperative resumption timing: We suggest waiting at least 24 hours before resuming LMWH bridging after a low-to-moderate-bleed-risk surgery/procedure and at least 48 to 72 hours after a high-bleed-risk surgery/procedure; when resumption is delayed for 48 to 72 hours in patients considered at high risk for postoperative VTE, low-dose LMWH can be administered for the initial 2 to 3 days before transition to LMWH bridging.

### A call to reduce the use of bridging anticoagulation [^b59711c4]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2016). Low credibility.

Because of the recent publication of several important studies, there has been a major change in how we think about perioperative management of anticoagulation. Because of these changes, existing consensus guidelines are suddenly out of date and can no longer be used as is, particularly the 2012 American College of Chest Physicians Antithrombotic Guidelines, version 9. We estimate that well over 90% of patients receiving warfarin therapy should not receive bridging anticoagulation during periprocedural interruptions of therapy, except under unusual circumstances and with appropriate justification. Accumulating evidence also suggests that bridging is not indicated among patients receiving direct-acting oral anticoagulant therapy. The large number of patients potentially affected represents an important safety concern and requires an immediate change in practice.

### How I treat anticoagulated patients undergoing an elective procedure or surgery [^04fb5c27]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

The periprocedural management of patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulant therapy remains a common but difficult clinical problem, with a lack of high-quality evidence to inform best practices. It is a patient's thromboembolic risk that drives the need for an aggressive periprocedural strategy, including the use of heparin bridging therapy, to minimize time off anticoagulant therapy, while the procedural bleed risk determines how and when postprocedural anticoagulant therapy should be resumed. Warfarin should be continued in patients undergoing selected minor procedures, whereas in major procedures that necessitate warfarin interruption, heparin bridging therapy should be considered in patients at high thromboembolic risk and in a minority of patients at moderate risk. Periprocedural data with the novel oral anticoagulants, such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, are emerging, but their relatively short half-life, rapid onset of action, and predictable pharmacokinetics should simplify periprocedural use. This review aims to provide a practical, clinician-focused approach to periprocedural anticoagulant management.

### Chronically anticoagulated patients who need surgery: can low-molecular-weight heparins really be used to "bridge" patients instead of intravenous unfractionated heparin? [^02e8b043]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2009). Low credibility.

Patients at high risk of arterial or venous thromboembolic events often receive chronic treatment with long-term oral anticoagulants such as warfarin. However, if these patients require an invasive procedure, they may require a temporary interruption of their warfarin therapy to minimize their bleeding risk during the procedure. As warfarin has a long half-life and an unpredictable pharmacokinetic profile, short-acting parenteral anticoagulants, such as unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), may be of benefit in protecting the patient from thromboemboli while their warfarin dose is withheld. Such "bridging therapy" has traditionally been provided in-hospital with intravenous UFH; however, recent data have suggested that LMWH may be an effective alternative, with potential cost-savings due to the ability to provide bridging therapy in the outpatient setting.

### The bridging conundrum: perioperative management of direct oral anticoagulants for venous thromboembolism [^003f316d]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2023). Medium credibility.

Most patients diagnosed with venous thromboembolism (VTE) are currently treated with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Before an invasive procedure or surgery, clinicians face the challenging decision of how to best manage DOACs. Should the DOAC be held, for how long, and are there instances where bridging with other anticoagulants should be considered? Although clinical trials indicate that most patients taking DOACs for atrial fibrillation do not require bridging anticoagulation, the optimal strategy for patients with a history of VTE is undefined. In this review, we present a case-based discussion for DOAC interruption perioperatively in patients receiving anticoagulation for management of VTE.

### Periprocedural antithrombotic management: a review of the literature and practical approach for the hospitalist physician [^11d93b48]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Many patients who are on long-term antithrombotic therapy (e.g. warfarin and/or antiplatelet agents) must be assessed for temporary discontinuation for a procedure or surgery, making this a salient topic for the hospitalist physician. Discontinuation of antithromhotic therapy can place patients at increased risk of thromboembolic complications while continuing antithrombotic therapy can increase procedure-related bleeding risk. Bridging anticoagulation with heparin or low molecular weight heparins is often used in the periprocedural period, but a great deal of uncertainty exists about how and when to use bridging anticoagulation. Because there is very little Level 1 evidence to define optimal care, both clinical practice and expert consensus guideline opinions vary. For the hospitalist, it is of critical importance to understand the available data, controversies, and management options in order to approach patient care rationally. This review provides a step-wise literature-based discussion addressing the following four questions: (1) What is the optimal management of antiplatelet therapy in the periprocedural period? (2) Are there very low bleeding risk procedures that do not require interruption of oral anticoagulation? (3) Are there low thromboembolic risk populations who do not require periprocedural bridging? (4) How do you manage patients who must discontinue anti-coagulants but are at an increased thrombotic risk?

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^4b651739]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Heparin bridging — management points should be considered when administering heparin bridging, including that bridging is most often done with a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) using a therapeutic-dose regimen (eg, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg bid, dalteparin 100 IU/kg bid); bridging with therapeutic-dose IV unfractionated heparin (UFH) is another treatment option, for example, in patients with severe renal insufficiency or who are dialysis-dependent; and other types of heparin bridging may include intermediate-dose regimens (eg, enoxaparin 40 mg bid). Heparin bridging should be administered in a manner to minimize the risk for bleeding that would require re-operation or another intervention, and avoidance of major bleeding is important because it typically requires a longer period of anticoagulant interruption that, in turn, exposes patients to an increased risk for thromboembolism.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) on VKA therapy — perioperative bridging: we suggest against heparin bridging for patients with VTE as the sole clinical indication who require VKA interruption for an elective surgery/procedure (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence), supported by evidence that there are no randomized trials and observational data show no benefit with more bleeding, including an observational cohort of 755 patients comparing bridging (n = 214) vs no bridging (n = 514) with no significant difference in recurrent VTE or bleeding, and a systematic review totaling 6,195 VKA-treated patients showing higher any bleeding with bridging 3.9% [95% CI: 2.0–7.4] vs 0.4% [95% CI: 0.1–1.7] and no effect on recurrent VTE 0.7% [95% CI: 0.4–1.2] vs 0.5% [95% CI: 0.3–0.8]; implementation notes clarify that suggesting against therapeutic-dose bridging does not preclude low-dose heparin, typically started within 24 hours after surgery and continued for up to 5 days while VKA is resumed, and that in selected high-risk VTE cases (e.g., recent (< 3 months) history of VTE, severe thrombophilia, selected active cancer) pre- and post-operative heparin bridging is suggested.

Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy interruption and heparin bridging — For patients classified as high risk for thromboembolism who require VKA interruption for an elective surgery/procedure, we suggest heparin bridging over no heparin bridging (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence). For patients classified as low-to-moderate-risk for thromboembolism who require VKA interruption for an elective surgery/procedure, we suggest against heparin bridging (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence). Stratification of perioperative thromboembolic risk is empiric with no validated clinical prediction models; a patient's individual risk profile may inform bridging decisions, and the type of surgery may also affect risk, with an anticipated higher risk in patients having open cardiac or major vascular surgery.

### Cost-effectiveness of bridging anticoagulation among patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^6b9d71fe]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Bridging anticoagulation is commonly prescribed to patients with atrial fibrillation during initiation and interruption of warfarin. Guidelines recommend bridging patients at high risk of stroke, while a recent randomized trial demonstrated overall harm in a population at comparatively low risk of ischemic stroke. Theory suggests that patients at high risk of stroke and low risk of hemorrhage may benefit from bridging, but data informing patient selection are scant.

Objective

To estimate the utility and cost-effectiveness of bridging anticoagulation among patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, stratified by thromboembolic and hemorrhagic risk DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis with lifelong time horizon, from the perspective of a third-party payer MAIN MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per bridged patient; US dollars per QALY gained KEY RESULTS: Unselected patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation may be harmed by bridging anticoagulation. Hospital admission for bridging is almost never cost-effective, and generally harmful. Among patients carefully selected by both thromboembolic and hemorrhagic risks, outpatient bridging can be beneficial and cost-effective. Results were sensitive to how effectively heparin products reduce stroke risk.

Conclusions

Outpatient bridging anticoagulation can be beneficial and cost-effective for a subset of patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation during interruption or initiation of warfarin. Admission for bridging should be avoided.

### Thromboembolic and bleeding risk of periprocedural bridging anticoagulation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^bb3858e4]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

An estimated 2.5 million patients use oral anticoagulants for the prevention of arterial thromboembolic events in North America, and one‐tenth of them require temporary interruption in preparation for an elective procedure or surgery. 1, 2 However, the safety and efficacy of bridging anticoagulation is not completely clarified for patients who need an anticoagulation interruption before invasive procedures. Two main concerns remain unsolved, the risk of thromboembolism, and the risk of bleeding. 1, 2

To reduce the bleeding risk for patients undergoing invasive procedures, oral anticoagulant is typically interrupted prior to the procedure, and then continued when hemostasis is achieved postprocedurally. 1, 2 Because the interruption of anticoagulation may expose patients to the risk of thromboembolism, heparin bridging (unfractionated heparin [UFH] or low‐molecular‐weight heparin [LMWH]) is administered to minimize the period of inadequate level of anticoagulation. 1, 2 It is of great importance to confirm whether bridging therapy reduces thromboembolic risk and to ascertain the safety of bridging therapy in relation to bleeding risk. 3

There have been many published articles related to bridging anticoagulation, 4, 5 but the quality of evidence with best practices is uneven across studies. Current guidelines from the 2019 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association suggest bridging anticoagulation used in patients with a high thrombosis risk, such as certain mechanical valve prostheses or recent pulmonary embolism during interruption of vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy. 3 However, these recommendations are primarily based on observational studies and experts' opinions. 3

Although Siegal and colleagues concluded that bridging anticoagulation increases bleeding risk and produces similar thromboembolic risk, their review included only one underpowered randomized trial together with some observational studies with no control arm to assess the safety and efficacy of bridging therapy. 6 To better clarify the risk and benefit of bridging therapy, we updated the current published data and conducted a meta‐analysis to compare the periprocedural thromboembolic and hemorrhagic risks between patients receiving interrupted anticoagulation with or without bridging therapy and continuous oral anticoagulation.

Regarding perioperative care for perioperative bleeding, more specifically with respect to management of antithrombotic therapy, VKAs, ACCP 2022 guidelines recommend to avoid administering heparin bridging in patients receiving VKA therapy deemed at low-to-moderate risk for thromboembolism and requiring VKA interruption for an elective surgery/procedure.

### Periprocedural management of patients receiving a vitamin K antagonist or a direct oral anticoagulant requiring an elective procedure or surgery [^d76a70fb]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2016). Low credibility.

The periprocedural management of patients receiving chronic therapy with oral anticoagulants (OACs), including vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin and direct OACs (DOACs), is a common clinical problem. The optimal perioperative management of patients receiving chronic OAC therapy is anchored on four key principles: (i) risk stratification of patient-related and procedure-related risks of thrombosis and bleeding; (ii) the clinical consequences of a thrombotic or bleeding event; (iii) discontinuation and reinitiation of OAC therapy on the basis of the pharmacokinetic properties of each agent; and (iv) whether aggressive management such as the use of periprocedural heparin bridging has advantages for the prevention of postoperative thromboembolism at the cost of a possible increase in bleeding risk. Recent data from randomized trials in patients receiving VKAs undergoing pacemaker/defibrillator implantation or using heparin bridging therapy for elective procedures or surgeries can now inform best practice. There are also emerging data on periprocedural outcomes in the DOAC trials for patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. This review summarizes the evidence for the periprocedural management of patients receiving chronic OAC therapy, focusing on recent randomized trials and large outcome studies, to address three key clinical scenarios: (i) can OAC therapy be safely continued for minor procedures or surgeries; (ii) if therapy with VKAs (especially warfarin) needs to be temporarily interrupted for an elective procedure/surgery, is heparin bridging necessary; and (iii) what is the optimal periprocedural management of the DOACs? In answering these questions, we aim to provide updated clinical guidance for the periprocedural management of patients receiving VKA or DOAC therapy, including the use of heparin bridging.

Introduction

Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), a treatable risk factor for ischemic stroke, is considered a worldwide epidemic predicted to increase in the coming decades. Indeed, in 2010, the estimated global prevalence of AF was 33.5 million. 1 Oral anticoagulation is the cornerstone treatment for NVAF patients with a moderate or high risk of thromboembolic complication. 2

Although direct oral anticoagulants (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban) have been on the market since 2010, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs: warfarin, acenocoumarol, fluindione) remain a standard treatment in the management of NVAF.

Recently, several studies have examined the risks of bleeding and of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism (IS/SE) associated with perioperative heparin bridging anticoagulation in patients with NVAF. 3, 4, 5, 6 However, no studies have investigated bridging risks during VKA initiation in outpatient settings.

It has been shown that the bleeding risk is highest during the first month of VKA initiation. 7 This risk may be greatest when a VKA is combined with another antithrombotic agent, particularly in patients for whom a bridging therapy is indicated. Bridging therapy at the initiation of VKA therapy consists of transitioning a bridging agent (low‐molecular‐weight heparin [LMWH] or other pentasaccharide, eg, fondaparinux and unfractionated heparin) to a VKA.

There is an overall consensus in favor of a bridging therapy prior to urgent cardioversion in patients with life‐threatening hemodynamic instability caused by new‐onset NVAF. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 The recommendation in guidelines 9, 10, 12 and summaries of product characteristics 14, 15 is less clear for those with stable NVAF who do not require rapid anticoagulation. In real‐life conditions, a bridging regimen is commonly used in those with a low stroke risk. 16, 17, 18, 19 This practice is not supported by evidence.

VKA use has declined recently in favor of direct oral anticoagulants; however, the latest available results have shown that they are still more widely used than direct oral anticoagulants. 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 Since millions of patients worldwide may be at risk of being unnecessarily exposed to bridging therapy, adverse health outcomes associated with management of VKA still warrant investigation.

Therefore, the purpose of this cohort study was to assess the safety and effectiveness of a bridging regimen during the initiation of VKA therapy in NVAF patients in outpatient care.

Perioperative antithrombotic management approach — individualized, patient-centric care aims to minimize perioperative thromboembolism and bleeding, is anchored on assessing patients' risk for thromboembolism and surgery/procedure-related bleeding, and uses empiric risk classification schemes that require prospective validation to help determine if perioperative anticoagulation interruption is needed and, among VKA-treated patients, if heparin bridging is needed.

Vitamin K antagonist maintenance — INR monitoring and isolated out-of-range results are addressed as follows: For patients taking VKA therapy with consistently stable INRs, we suggest an INR testing frequency of up to 12 weeks rather than every 4 weeks (Grade 2B). For patients taking VKAs with previously stable therapeutic INRs who present with a single out-of-range INR of ≤ 0.5 below or above therapeutic, we suggest continuing the current dose and testing the INR within 1 to 2 weeks (Grade 2C). For patients with stable therapeutic INRs presenting with a single subtherapeutic INR value, we suggest against routinely administering bridging with heparin (Grade 2C). For patients taking VKAs, we suggest against routine use of vitamin K supplementation (Grade 2C).

### Updated guidelines on outpatient anticoagulation [^efc160e1]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

The American College of Chest Physicians provides recommendations for the use of anticoagulant medications for several indications that are important in the primary care setting. Warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, is recommended for the treatment of venous thromboembolism and for the prevention of stroke in persons with atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or valvular heart disease. When warfarin therapy is initiated for venous thromboembolism, it should be given the first day, along with a heparin product or fondaparinux. The heparin product or fondaparinux should be continued for at least five days and until the patient's international normalized ratio is at least 2.0 for two consecutive days. The international normalized ratio goal and duration of treatment with warfarin vary depending on indication and risk. Warfarin therapy should be stopped five days before major surgery and restarted 12 to 24 hours postoperatively. Bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin or other agents is based on balancing the risk of thromboembolism with the risk of bleeding. Increasingly, self-testing is an option for selected patients on warfarin therapy. The ninth edition of the American College of Chest Physicians guidelines, published in 2012, includes a discussion of anticoagulants that have gained approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration since publication of the eighth edition in 2008. Dabigatran and apixaban are indicated for the prevention of systemic embolism and stroke in persons with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Rivaroxaban is indicated for the prevention of deep venous thrombosis in patients undergoing knee or hip replacement surgery, for treatment of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, for reducing the risk of recurrent deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism after initial treatment, and for prevention of systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.

### Perioperative management of vitamin K antagonists and direct oral anticoagulants: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c22b707b]. Chest (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The management of patients who are receiving chronic oral anticoagulation therapy and require an elective surgery or an invasive procedure is a common clinical scenario.

Research Question

What is the best available evidence to support the development of American College of Chest Physicians guidelines on the perioperative management of patients who are receiving long-term vitamin K agonist (VKA) or direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) and require elective surgery or procedures?

Study Design and Methods

A literature search including multiple databases from database inception through July 16, 2020, was performed. Meta-analyses were conducted when appropriate.

Results

In patients receiving VKA (warfarin) undergoing elective noncardiac surgery, shorter (< 3 days) VKA interruption is associated with an increased risk of major bleeding. In patients who required VKA interruption, heparin bridging (mostly with low-molecular-weight heparin [LMWH]) was associated with a statistically significant increased risk of major bleed, representing a very low certainty of evidence (COE). Compared with DOAC interruption 1 to 4 days before surgery, continuing DOACs may be associated with higher risk of bleeding demonstrated in some, but not all studies. In patients who needed DOAC interruption, bridging with LMWH may be associated with a statistically significant increased risk of bleeding, representing a low COE.

Interpretation

The certainty in the evidence supporting the perioperative management of anticoagulants remains limited. No high-quality evidence exists to support the practice of heparin bridging during the interruption of VKA or DOAC therapy for an elective surgery or procedure, or for the practice of interrupting VKA therapy for minor procedures, including cardiac device implantation, or continuation of a DOAC vs short-term interruption of a DOAC in the perioperative period.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^dbe6c101]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The American College of Chest Physicians Clinical Practice Guideline on the Perioperative Management of Antithrombotic Therapy addresses 43 Patients-Interventions-Comparators-Outcomes (PICO) questions related to the perioperative management of patients who are receiving long-term oral anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy and require an elective surgery/procedure. This guideline is separated into four broad categories, encompassing the management of patients who are receiving: (1) a vitamin K antagonist (VKA), mainly warfarin; (2) if receiving a VKA, the use of perioperative heparin bridging, typically with a low-molecular-weight heparin; (3) a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC); and (4) an antiplatelet drug.

Methods

Strong or conditional practice recommendations are generated based on high, moderate, low, and very low certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology for clinical practice guidelines.

Results

A multidisciplinary panel generated 44 guideline recommendations for the perioperative management of VKAs, heparin bridging, DOACs, and antiplatelet drugs, of which two are strong recommendations: (1) against the use of heparin bridging in patients with atrial fibrillation; and (2) continuation of VKA therapy in patients having a pacemaker or internal cardiac defibrillator implantation. There are separate recommendations on the perioperative management of patients who are undergoing minor procedures, comprising dental, dermatologic, ophthalmologic, pacemaker/internal cardiac defibrillator implantation, and GI (endoscopic) procedures.

Conclusions

Substantial new evidence has emerged since the 2012 iteration of these guidelines, especially to inform best practices for the perioperative management of patients who are receiving a VKA and may require heparin bridging, for the perioperative management of patients who are receiving a DOAC, and for patients who are receiving one or more antiplatelet drugs. Despite this new knowledge, uncertainty remains as to best practices for the majority of perioperative management questions.

Management of anticoagulation in elective cases

Three factors that need to be considered in the case of elective surgeries are (1) when to stop, (2) whether to bridge, and (3) when to restart.

Discontinuation prior to surgery: General recommendations are summarized in the table (table 8) below and are according to the American College of Chest Physician 2012 Guidelines published in Chest, the RE-LY trial published in Circulation 2012, the ROCKET AF trial, and the manufacturer's recommendations.

Table 8
Recommendations for timing of discontinuation of anticoagulation for elective surgery

Patients whose procedures are at low risk of bleeding may continue oral anticoagulation therapy. This is particularly true for high-risk patients such as those with mechanical heart values.

Indications for bridging: The need for perioperative bridging is decided on by taking into account the patient's thromboembolism and hemorrhage risk and stratifying them into low, medium and high risk. In the case of warfarin, recommendations are summarized in the flow chart below (figure 3), adapted from the 2012 American College of Chest Physicians Guidelines. Bridging may be achieved either with intravenous unfractionated heparin or with subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin. Temporary interruption of vitamin K antagonism agents, without bridging while the INR is subtherapeutic, is recommended for patients with bileaflet mechanical aortic valve replacements and no other risk factors. All other mechanical valve settings should undergo bridging.

Figure 3
Algorithm for perioperative bridging of warfarin. INR, International Normalized Ratio; LMWH, low-molecular-weight heparin; UFH, unfractionated heparin.

Efficacy of bridging: Whether or not outcomes are really better with bridging patients on vitamin K antagonists remains uncertain. A meta-analysis published by Siegal et al in 2012 found that the rate of thromboembolism was equivalent in patients who underwent periprocedural heparin bridging; however, there was a significantly higher number of patients who had major bleeding complications in those undergoing heparin bridging. These results were replicated in a randomized controlled trial by Douketis et al in 2015 demonstrating non-inferiority between patients undergoing no bridging versus those with low-molecular-weight heparin bridging and a significant reduction of major bleeding complications in those patients who did not undergo bridging.

### Surgeon's guide to anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications part two: antiplatelet agents and perioperative management of long-term anticoagulation [^8580c98a]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2016). Low credibility.

With the non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants, no strong evidence to support bridging exists currently. These anticoagulants have a shorter half-life and faster onset making the benefits of bridging less obvious. A study from the European Dresden registry from 2014 demonstrated that in patients taking nonvitamin K antagonists, heparin bridging did not reduce cardiovascular events, and major bleeding again was more frequent with bridging than without. Additionally, the HASBLED scoring system used to gauge the risk of hemorrhage can also be used to estimate risk of hemorrhage heparin bridging during warfarin cessation. Recommendations are unclear regarding the efficacy and need for bridging with DOACs.

Re-initiation of oral anticoagulation: The decision to restart anticoagulation after a procedure is again determined by weighing the risks for thromboembolism against that of hemorrhage. If hemostasis is assured after the procedure, vitamin K antagonists can be restarted 6–24 hours after surgery as therapeutic levels will take several days to reach. If periprocedural bridging is being used, patients at low risk of bleeding can resume bridging at 24 hours and those at higher bleed risk at 48–72 hours for all high-risk patients. Non-vitamin K antagonists could potentially be resumed after 6–24 hours in patients with low bleeding risk if hemostasis is assured, bearing in mind that these agents have a much faster time of onset. Those with higher bleeding risk should wait 48–72 hours prior to restarting and could be considered for bridging with heparin if the risk of thromboembolism is also high.

Periprocedural warfarin management and bridging — For patients at high thromboembolic risk (defined as a risk of arterial thrombosis of > 10% per year or venous thromboembolism [VTE] risk exceeding 10% per month), bridging therapy may be used, whereas the ACCP guidelines recommend against heparin bridging for patients at low-to-moderate thromboembolic risk. Warfarin is discontinued 5 days prior to the surgical date, and in high-risk patients low molecular weight heparin (LMWH; enoxaparin 1 mg/kg two times per day) is initiated once the PT INR has fallen below the lower end of the target range, ensuring creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 30 mL/min and platelet counts (≥ 100×10⁹/L); the last dose of LMWH is given in the morning on the day preceding the procedure. For VTE indications, bridging LMWH can be considered if the thrombotic event occurred within 3 months, if there is active cancer, or if documented severe thrombophilia is present; otherwise, warfarin can be stopped 5 days prior and restarted after the procedure, with appropriate DVT prophylaxis warranted during the periprocedural interval prior to therapeutic warfarin resumption.

### A systematic update on the state of novel anticoagulants and a primer on reversal and bridging [^c3b1d194]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Current prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) includes familiar agents that have been in use for many years, including unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). A number of novel oral anticoagulants are currently developed or are in stages of development to either replace VKAs in concert with initial heparin or LMWH, or to replace both heparin/LMWH and VKAs totally as monotherapy. These agents hold the promise of not requiring monitoring, being safer in terms of bleeding risk than current agents, and being of equal or improved efficacy compared with established anticoagulants.

Methods

In the following report, we systematically review the oral agents currently approved or closest to approval for both VTE and atrial fibrillation treatment, focusing on the treatment of VTE: dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban.

Results

Findings of clinical use and comparisons to standard care of these agents are summarized in depth, by succinctly reviewing all major randomized controlled trials. Mechanistic and functional differences are reviewed, as Dabigatran targets activated factor II (factor IIa), while rivaroxaban and apixaban target activated factor X (factor Xa). We also discuss the inability at the present time to reliably reverse the anticoagulant effects of these agents, provide a suggested strategy for reversal, and finally discuss an approach to bridging these agents when other procedures are required while currently taking one of these three agents.

Conclusions

These agents, while still with many unanswered questions, demonstrate great promise in the prevention and treatment of VTE.

Anticoagulation bridging — who and how to bridge — should be used selectively for high thrombotic risk. If an individual is particularly high risk (e.g., pulmonary embolus within the last 3 months, severe thrombophilia, or artificial heart valve), bridging anticoagulation in the form of intravenous or low molecular weight heparin can be employed only after multidisciplinary discussion. Bridging is advised when the INR is down to 2, unfractionated heparin should be stopped 6 hours before the procedure and low molecular weight heparin should be held on the morning of the procedure, and both can be restarted 6–12 hours after the procedure unless hemostasis intervention is needed.

### Who are we bridging? Description of warfarin patients receiving injectable bridging therapy [^b478c0f7]. Thrombosis Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The evidence guiding the decision to provide injectable anticoagulant bridging therapy during periods of subtherapeutic warfarin anticoagulation is sparse. This study aims to identify the types of patients currently bridged within an academic medical center's Thrombosis Service, to highlight patient populations for future study of bridging outcomes.

Methods

This descriptive cohort study included patients taking warfarin managed by University of Utah Health Thrombosis Service who received outpatient enoxaparin bridging between January 1 and December 31, 2022. Anticoagulation indication, reason for bridging, and type of procedure were validated via manual chart review.

Results

During the one-year study period, 181 unique patients (9.4% of the service's total warfarin population) experienced 244 bridging episodes, mostlyin the periprocedural setting (67.6%) for gastrointestinal-type procedures (39.4%). The most common anticoagulation indications in all bridged patients were antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) (23.2%), venous thromboembolism (VTE) (21.5%), or a mechanical mitral valve plus another indication (13.3%). Most bridging episodes for VTE occurred > 3 months from the acute event, with the rationale for bridging including breakthrough VTE (31%) or APS (23%). Just over one-half of bridged patients fit the guideline-recommended criteria for high thrombotic risk, and just over one-third were low-moderate thrombotic risk.

Conclusions

In this one-year outpatient study, warfarin patients received enoxaparin bridging most commonly due to a gastrointestinal procedural interruption in the setting of APS, VTE with a prior breakthrough thrombotic event, or mechanical mitral valve. Just over one-third of bridged patients were guideline-classified as low-moderate thrombotic risk, indicating these populations may warrant further investigation or bridging de-escalation.

### LMWH as bridge anticoagulation during warfarin… [^3dfb5459]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Temporary interruption of warfarin treatment is sometimes necessary when patients who require anticoagulant therapy need surgery or other invasive procedures. Interruption of anticoagulant therapy can result in a significant increased risk for thromboembolic morbidity and mortality. Many different strategies for bridge therapy use short-acting anticoagulants in patients taking warfarin. One strategy is to hospitalize patients and stop warfarin therapy four to five days before surgery, using intravenous unfractionated heparin as the bridge anticoagulation. Another strategy uses low-molecular-weight heparin as the bridging anticoagulant. Despite these suggestions and the frequency of this problem before surgery or an invasive procedure, these strategies have not been studied vigorously. Douketis and colleagues evaluated the safety and efficacy of a standardized periprocedural anticoagulation regimen using LMWH.

The study included consecutive adult patients who were on warfarin therapy for thromboembolism prevention and had scheduled an elective surgery or invasive procedure that required the normalization of the International Normalized Ratio. All patients received a standard anticoagulation regimen. Warfarin was stopped five to six days before the procedure. Three days before the procedure, LMWH at a dosage of 100 IU per kg twice daily was started. The last dose of dalteparin was given no less than 12 hours before the procedure. On the day of the procedure, if hemostasis was adequate, warfarin was restarted, usually in the evening. If patients had a low risk for bleeding, dalteparin was restarted the following day at the preprocedural dosage and continued until the INR was at least 2.
0. If the patient was at high risk for bleeding, no dalteparin was used, and the warfarin was continued.

The major outcomes measured during the study included thromboembolic events, major bleeding problems, and death. A secondary outcome was increased wound-related blood loss in patients who were not at high risk for bleeding. The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. The authors conclude that patients who receive chronic warfarin therapy and require temporary interruption of treatment can be managed with LMWH. They note that this management strategy can be used with a low risk for thromboembolic and major bleeding complications.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^541aba5d]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Perioperative antithrombotic management — scope and PICO framework include the following: Approximately 15% to 20% of patients who are receiving anticoagulant therapy will require a surgery/procedure annually, and 10% to 15% of patients with coronary stents will require surgery within 2 years of implantation, highlighting the clinical burden. The current American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) guidelines have expanded to address 43 Patients-Interventions-Comparators-Outcomes (PICO) questions, and the aims are (1) to provide evidence-based recommendations for the perioperative management of patients who are receiving antithrombotic therapy; and (2) to provide practical guidance to clinicians for managing such patients in the perioperative period. The PICO questions and guideline statements are separated into four broad categories: patients receiving a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) focused on warfarin, among patients receiving a VKA the use of perioperative heparin bridging, patients receiving a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC), and patients receiving an antiplatelet drug.

The perioperative management of patients with atrial fibrillation who require an elective surgical or other invasive procedure is an area of ongoing uncertainty. Accumulating evidence from observational studies suggests that the use of bridging anticoagulation with heparin, although well-intentioned, might not reduce perioperative thromboembolism and can increase bleeding.

### Personalizing bridging anticoagulation in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation-a microsimulation analysis [^547a0e3b]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Bridging anticoagulation is commonly prescribed to patients with atrial fibrillation who are initiating warfarin or require interruption of anticoagulation. Current guidelines recommend bridging for patients at high risk of stroke. Among patients with atrial fibrillation and one or more risk factors for ischemic stroke, the recently published BRIDGE trial found forgoing bridging during interruption to be, on average, noninferior to bridging with respect to ischemic complications, with significantly fewer hemorrhagic complications.

Objective

We sought to examine the benefits and harms of bridging anticoagulation across the spectrum of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke risk and thereby enable more nuanced, risk-stratified decision-making when bridging is considered during initiation or interruption of vitamin K antagonists.

Design

A Monte Carlo simulation, using a combination of literature-derived estimates, registry data, and trial data.

Main Measures

Net clinical benefit, weighting for ischemic strokes, intracranial hemorrhages, and extracranial major hemorrhages.

Key Results

The benefits and harms of bridging anticoagulation vary according to underlying patient risk profiles for both thromboembolic stroke and major intracranial bleeding. Patients at high risk of ischemic stroke and low risk of hemorrhage derive benefit from bridging during initiation or interruption of warfarin therapy. Patients at similarly high or low risk of both outcomes may receive benefit from bridging during initiation and bridging during interruption, but this was sensitive to underlying assumptions. The need for stratification along both axes of risk was robust to a wide range of parameters.

Conclusions

Bridging anticoagulation may provide benefit to patients at high risk of ischemic stroke and low risk of intracranial hemorrhage who are initiating or interrupting warfarin therapy, while patients at high or low risk of both complications may be harmed. The use of bridging anticoagulation in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation should be considered only after stratification by risk of ischemic and hemorrhagic complications.

### Low-molecular-weight heparin as bridging anticoagulation during interruption of warfarin… [^58296929]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

In 108 patients who underwent a high-bleeding-risk procedure, there were 2 deaths possibly due to thromboembolism and 2 major bleeding episodes. Conclusions In patients at increased risk for arterial thromboembolism who require temporary interruption of warfarin therapy, a standardized periprocedural anticoagulant regimen with low-molecular-weight heparin is associated with a low risk of thromboembolic and major bleeding complications. The rationale for bridging anticoagulation is to minimize the time before and after a procedure that patients are not receiving therapeutic anticoagulation and, thereby, minimize the risk of thromboembolism. The conventional periprocedural anticoagulation approach is to hospitalize patients 4 to 5 days before surgery to stop warfarin and administer intravenous unfractionated heparin while the anticoagulant effect of warfarin recedes.

15, 16 Intravenous heparin is stopped 3 to 4 hours before the procedure to avoid a residual anticoagulant effect at the time of the procedure. Dalteparin was continued until the INR was 2. 0 or more. In patients undergoing a non–high-bleeding-risk procedure who had inadequate postprocedural hemostasis, the resumption of warfarin was delayed until the first postprocedural day, and dalteparin was delayed until the second or third postprocedural day when hemostasis was secured. In all patients, the initial postprocedural dose of warfarin corresponded to the patient's usual dose for that day of the week, and antiplatelet therapy was resumed on the same day as dalteparin.

In this registry of 650 patients at increased risk for arterial thromboembolism who required temporary interruption of warfarin therapy for an elective procedure, a standardized bridging anticoagulation regimen with LMWH was associated with a low risk of thromboembolic and major bleeding complications in the immediate periprocedural period, and was feasible for out-of-hospital administration. This was done because in patients who receive LMWH after a surgical procedure, more than 90% of major bleeding episodes occur at the surgical wound site, 44–46 and such bleeding is more likely to occur with early postprocedural initiation of anticoagulant therapy, 4 to 12 hours after surgery, than.

### Heparin bridging in warfarin anticoagulation therapy initiation could increase bleeding in non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients: a multicenter propensity-matched analysis [^e10f9e57]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The efficacy of heparin-bridging therapy during the initiation of oral anticoagulation therapy (OAC) in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) is unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and the safety of heparin-bridging therapy during OAC initiation in NVAF patients.

Patients/Methods

This study included 5327 consecutive warfarin-naïve NVAF patients who received OAC that was initiated with (n = 1053) or without (n = 4274) heparin bridging at four tertiary hospitals. Stroke and bleeding events within 30 days of OAC were evaluated.

Results

While there was no difference in the incidence of stroke (0.5% vs. 0.3%, P = 0.381), major bleeding rate (0.9% vs. 0.3%, P = 0.004) was higher in heparin-bridged than in non-bridged patients. This trend remained in the propensity score-matched population (stroke 0.5% vs. 0.6%, P = 0.762; major bleeding 0.8% vs. 0.1%, P = 0.019). A high CHA2 DS2 -VASc score was an independent predictor for stroke, whereas bridging therapy had no beneficial effect in preventing stroke regardless of CHADS2 or CHA2 DS2 -VASc scores. The HAS-BLED score had a predictive value for major bleeding (odds ratio 1.80, 95% confidence interval 1.11–2.92, P = 0.018), and heparin-bridging therapy was associated with a higher major bleeding rate (odds ratio 4.44, 95% confidence interval 1.68–11.72, P = 0.003), especially in patients with a HAS-BLED score of ≥ 1.

Conclusions

The heparin-bridging therapy increased bleeding without the benefit of preventing stroke at the initiation of OAC in NVAF. Our data suggest that heparin bridging should not be considered at the initiation of OAC in NVAF patients.

1 INTRODUCTION

Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) have a 4‐ to 5‐fold increased risk of ischemic stroke compared to patients in sinus rhythm. 1 The annual risk of stroke is 1.69% to 4.2% in patients with AF, with 15% of strokes in the United States attributed to AF. 2 To mitigate this risk, hospitalized patients are often treated with parenteral anticoagulation during perioperative interruption of oral anticoagulation or while oral anticoagulation is sub‐therapeutic.

Recent studies suggest perioperative bridging in patients with AF provides limited benefit in terms of preventing thromboembolic events, but increases bleeding rates. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 Most studies, including the BRIDGE trial, 3 the only randomized placebo‐controlled trial, evaluated perioperative bridging strategies for elective surgeries, whereas the data for bridging hospitalized patients with acute issues has until recently not been addressed. 5 These studies enrolled predominantly low to moderate thromboembolic risk patients (mean CHADS 2 = 2.1‐2.4 and CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc = 3.6‐4.1) and limited patients at higher thromboembolic risk. Studies have also shown that perioperative bridging in AF is associated with a 4‐fold risk of bleeding compared to non‐bridging strategies (any bleed rates: 5%‐34% and major bleed rates: 3%‐9%) with undifferentiated thromboembolic events (0%‐4%). 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 Current guidelines and expert consensus support perioperative bridging with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin or intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) for patients taking oral vitamin K antagonists who are at high risk for thromboembolism, indicated by a CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score greater than 5 to 6 or a prior thromboembolic event. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 However, there is currently limited data and differing consensus within guidelines and literature regarding UFH dosing intensity for bridging in AF. The perioperative antithrombotic CHEST guidelines recommend targeting an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 1.5 to 2.0 times the control aPTT value (considered low intensity), while the antithrombotic therapy in AF CHEST guidelines recommend targeting an anti‐Xa of 0.3 to 0.7 units/mL (considered high intensity). 10, 11 Furthermore, many major guidelines do not provide any recommendations on anticoagulation targets for bridging in AF. 8, 13, 14 Comparing the safety and efficacy of high vs low intensity UFH infusion regimens has not been addressed.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic medications… [^51f5ce31]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Management of Vitamin K Antagonist Medications For patients taking the vitamin K antagonist warfarin, continue the medication if bleeding risk is minimal. With low to moderate or high bleeding risk, stop warfarin; patients with high thrombosis risk should receive heparin before and after surgery. In patients who are at low to moderate risk for thromboembolism, no bridging with heparin is recommended. For atrial fibrillation, the benefits of bridging are less certain because the stroke risk over a few days is low. Warfarin should be stopped at least five days before the procedure and restarted 12 to 24 hours after the procedure if hemostasis has been obtained. Heparin bridging can occur with unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin. If intravenous unfractionated heparin is used, heparin should be stopped at least four hours before the procedure and restarted at least 24 hours after the procedure.

If low-molecular-weight heparin is used, give one-half the daily dosage 24 hours before the procedure, and wait at least 24 hours after surgery to give the first postoperative dose of low-molecular-weight heparin. If the surgery has a high bleeding risk, wait 48 to 72 hours before restarting heparin to ensure hemostasis. Management of Antiplatelet Medications Continuing aspirin is recommended for all noncardiac surgery. If stopping aspirin, the American College of Chest Physicians recommends stopping within seven days of surgery. P2Y. 12 platelet receptor inhibitors should be stopped before surgery. Stop clopidogrel five days before surgery, ticagrelor three to five days before surgery, and prasugrel seven to 10 days before surgery. All P2Y 12 inhibitors can be restarted within 24 hours of surgery if hemostasis has been obtained. 12 inhibitor and continue aspirin therapy.

Bridging these gaps with antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications does not improve outcomes. Because these medications can be held one to two days before surgery and restarted one to two days after surgery, bridging with heparin is not recommended, unlike with warfarin. The other interesting recommendation is to continue aspirin through the surgery because of little, if any, increase in bleeding. — Michael J. Arnold, MD, Assistant Medical Editor.

Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy — atrial fibrillation requiring elective surgery/procedure: we recommend against heparin bridging (Strong Recommendation, Moderate Certainty of Evidence). Evidence cited shows no reduction in arterial thromboembolism (ATE) but higher bleeding with bridging, including ATE 0.3% vs 0.4% (OR = 0.80; 95% CI: 0.42–1.54) and major bleeding 3.2% vs 1.3% (OR = 3.60; 95% CI: 1.52–8.50); in the PERIOP-2 atrial fibrillation subgroup, bridging (n = 670) vs no bridging (n = 497) had major thromboembolism 0.75% vs 1.41% and major bleeding 1.64% vs 2.62%; further analyses found higher bleeding with heparin bridging, such as major bleeding 6.8% vs 1.6% (OR = 4.4; 95% CI: 2.4–8.1) and clinically important bleeding 5.0% vs 1.3% (OR = 3.84; 95% CI: 2.07–7.14), with cardiovascular events 4.6% vs 2.5% (OR = 1.62; 95% CI: 0.95–2.78); a meta-analysis noted no significant difference in ATE but increased bleeding, in a mixed population of whom 44% had atrial fibrillation; in implementation considerations, in selected patients considered at high risk for thromboembolism (Table 1), including those with a CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 7 or CHADS2 score of 5 or 6, pre- and post-operative heparin bridging is suggested.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^a1b03dd0]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Valvular heart disease — planned interruption of VKA and bridging — When interruption of oral VKA therapy is deemed necessary, the agent is usually stopped 3 to 4 days before the procedure and restarted postoperatively as soon as bleeding risk allows; bridging with intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) or subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is started when the INR falls below the therapeutic threshold (ie, 2.0 or 2.5), usually 36 to 48 hours before surgery, and is stopped 4 to 6 hours (intravenous UFH) or 12 hours (subcutaneous LMWH) before the procedure. There are no randomized comparative-effectiveness trials in adequate numbers of prosthetic heart valve patients, evidence derives mostly from cohort studies with poor or no comparator groups, and in other patient groups bridging therapy exposes patients to higher bleeding risks without reducing thromboembolism; accordingly, decisions about bridging should be individualized and account for the tradeoffs between thrombosis and bleeding.

### Perioperative bridging anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation [^9807dc2a]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

It is uncertain whether bridging anticoagulation is necessary for patients with atrial fibrillation who need an interruption in warfarin treatment for an elective operation or other elective invasive procedure. We hypothesized that forgoing bridging anticoagulation would be noninferior to bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin for the prevention of perioperative arterial thromboembolism and would be superior to bridging with respect to major bleeding.

Methods

We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which, after perioperative interruption of warfarin therapy, patients were randomly assigned to receive bridging anticoagulation therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin (100 IU of dalteparin per kilogram of body weight) or matching placebo administered subcutaneously twice daily, from 3 days before the procedure until 24 hours before the procedure and then for 5 to 10 days after the procedure. Warfarin treatment was stopped 5 days before the procedure and was resumed within 24 hours after the procedure. Follow-up of patients continued for 30 days after the procedure. The primary outcomes were arterial thromboembolism (stroke, systemic embolism, or transient ischemic attack) and major bleeding.

Results

In total, 1884 patients were enrolled, with 950 assigned to receive no bridging therapy and 934 assigned to receive bridging therapy. The incidence of arterial thromboembolism was 0.4% in the no-bridging group and 0.3% in the bridging group (risk difference, 0.1 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.6 to 0.8; P = 0.01 for noninferiority). The incidence of major bleeding was 1.3% in the no-bridging group and 3.2% in the bridging group (relative risk, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.78; P = 0.005 for superiority).

Conclusions

In patients with atrial fibrillation who had warfarin treatment interrupted for an elective operation or other elective invasive procedure, forgoing bridging anticoagulation was noninferior to perioperative bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin for the prevention of arterial thromboembolism and decreased the risk of major bleeding.

### Peri-procedural management of oral anticoagulants in the DOAC era [^784041c7]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Peri-procedural management of oral anticoagulants can be complex and confusing for many providers. It involves a careful balance of a patient's thromboembolic risk and bleeding risk. For every patient chronically taking an oral anticoagulant who will be undergoing an elective procedure, a four step approach may be considered when creating a plan for the oral anticoagulant. (1) Does the oral anticoagulant need to stop for the procedure? (2) If yes, when should the oral anticoagulant be stopped pre-procedure? (3) Does the patient require a "bridging" parenteral anticoagulant? (4) When should anticoagulation be re-started post procedure? Based on the unique features of warfarin versus the direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC), a unique, personalized plan should be developed and tailored to the individual patient. Anticoagulant specialists, such as anticoagulation clinic pharmacists, may help facilitate this process.

Warfarin

Warfarin has a half‐life of approximately 36 h and so should therefore be stopped 5 days before elective surgery to ensure haemostasis has returned to normal. The INR should be measured the day prior to surgery. If the risk of thrombosis is high, bridging can be used to reduce the thrombotic risk, although it is worth noting there is little proven benefit and a possible risk of increased peri‐operative bleeding in patients taking warfarin for atrial fibrillation.

Individualised decisions are recommended whether bridging is necessary in certain situations; in particular, those patients taking warfarin for mechanical heart valves require special consideration. The type of valve (bileaflet vs. caged ball and tilting disc), valve position (aortic vs. mitral) and patient risk factors (such as previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack, atrial fibrillation) should be considered; however, in general all patients with mechanical heart valves (with the exception of bileaflet aortic valve with no other risk factors) should have bridging anticoagulation.

For patients with acute VTE the risk of recurrence without anticoagulation is very high in the first 3 months, and surgery will increase the risk further; therefore, bridging should be considered (Table 6). When a patient is more than 3 months from an acute event the risk of recurrence is much lower and postoperative prophylactic dose LMWH should be sufficient. For patients with AF, the CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASC score may be used to predict stroke risk and help select those who would benefit from bridging. Patients with AF who have a score of ≤ 4 and who have not had a stroke or TIA in the last 3 months should not receive bridging. Patients who have had a stroke or TIA within the last 3 months, or who have a previous stroke/TIA with three or more risk factors (hypertension, age > 75 years, diabetes or congestive cardiac failure), should be considered for bridging.

Peri‐operative bridging warfarin anticoagulation for major surgery with high thrombotic risk.

Emergency surgery

If surgery can wait for 6–8 h, then 5 mg of intravenous phytomenadione (vitamin K) can restore coagulation factors although this may preclude warfarinisation for a few days subsequently; if this is not possible, anticoagulation can be reversed with 25–50 iu.kg ‐1 of PCC.

Conclusions

Bridging therapy was widely used at the initiation of oral anticoagulation in a stable NVAF population. This practice did not decrease the IS/SE risk but increased the bleeding risk. These findings do not support the use of routine bridging in this population.

### Heparin bridge is associated with more post-polypectomy bleeding and emergency department visits among anticoagulated patients [^f60be260]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Colonoscopy remains the preferred method for prevention of colorectal cancer, serving as both a screening and a therapeutic modality. With an estimated 22.4 million colonoscopies performed annually in the United States and another 11 million individuals estimated to be taking anticoagulant therapy, gastroenterologists will increasingly need to be familiar with these medications and understand the associated adverse events. It is essential for clinicians to understand, and more importantly reduce, procedure-associated adverse events, including the most common post-polypectomy bleeding. Reported to occur in approximately 0.3–10% of cases overall, the incidence of post-polypectomy bleeding related specifically to a population of patients on anticoagulants is less well defined.

Patients using anticoagulation therapy present a unique and common clinical dilemma for the gastroenterologist: balancing the risk of anticoagulation cessation against the risk of procedure-associated hemorrhage. Additional concerns that must be factored into this decision include the risk of thromboembolic events, reported to be as high as 3% when anticoagulation is withheld. To reduce this risk of thromboembolic events, high-risk patients have traditionally been switched from warfarin to a shorter-acting bridge anticoagulation therapy (i.e. unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin [LMWH]). Despite current guidelines from national societies regarding the management of periprocedural anticoagulants, it remains unclear whether stopping anticoagulants temporarily and substituting them with LMWH as a temporary anticoagulant bridge therapy will result in more post-colonoscopy bleeding and a smaller number of thromboembolic events compared to complete anticoagulant interruption.

Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate both the bleeding adverse events and thromboembolic events in patients undergoing colonoscopy who usually take anticoagulants, comparing those using a heparin bridge (hep-bridge) with those who temporarily stop all anticoagulation medications.

### Perioperative management of patients on chronic antithrombotic therapy [^9530d69b]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy is a situation that occurs frequently and requires consideration of the patient, the procedure, and an expanding array of anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents. Preoperative assessment must address each patient's risk for thromboembolic events balanced against the risk for perioperative bleeding. Procedures can be separated into those with a low bleeding risk, which generally do not require complete reversal of the antithrombotic therapy, and those associated with an intermediate or high bleeding risk. For patients who are receiving warfarin who need interruption of the anticoagulant, consideration must be given to whether simply withholding the anticoagulant is the optimal approach or whether a perioperative "bridge" with an alternative agent, typically a low-molecular-weight heparin, should be used. The new oral anticoagulants dabigatran and rivaroxaban have shorter effective half-lives, but they introduce other concerns for perioperative management, including prolonged drug effect in patients with renal insufficiency, limited experience with clinical laboratory testing to confirm lack of residual anticoagulant effect, and lack of a reversal agent. Antiplatelet agents must also be considered in the perioperative setting, with particular consideration given to the potential risk for thrombotic complications in patients with coronary artery stents who have antiplatelet therapy withheld.

### The current status of bridging anticoagulation [^53644f56]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). Low credibility.

For patients prescribed chronic vitamin K antagonist therapy requiring a surgical or invasive procedure, the question of whether or not to bridge and how to bridge is commonly encountered in clinical practice. Bridging anticoagulation has evolved over the years and the evidence base for current practice is deficient in many areas. Clinical trials currently being completed with conventional anticoagulants should help strengthen the evidence base for future practice. The availability of novel oral anticoagulants is a welcome addition, though their optimal management peri-procedure is yet to be determined. Prospective multi-centre controlled studies that can provide the evidence base for novel oral anticoagulant peri-procedural management are required.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^a5d512db]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) periprocedural anticoagulation management — In patients with AF (excluding those with recent stroke or TIA, or a mechanical valve) on warfarin or a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) undergoing an invasive procedure or surgery, temporary cessation of oral anticoagulation without bridging anticoagulation is recommended. In patients with AF on warfarin anticoagulation and an annual predicted risk of thromboembolism of ≥ 5% undergoing pacemaker or defibrillator implantation or generator change, continued anticoagulation is recommended in preference to interruption of warfarin and bridging anticoagulation with heparin to reduce the risk of pocket hematoma. In patients with AF with CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2 or equivalent risk of stroke on DOAC anticoagulation and undergoing pacemaker or defibrillator implantation or generator change, either uninterrupted or interrupted DOAC is reasonable. If an invasive procedure or surgery cannot be performed safely on uninterrupted DOAC, the timing of DOAC interruption should be guided by the specific agent, renal function, and the bleeding risk of the procedure. After DOAC interruption for a procedure or surgery, resumption of anticoagulation the day after low bleeding risk surgery and between the evening of the second day and the evening of the third day after high bleeding risk surgery is reasonable, as long as hemostasis has been achieved and further bleeding is not anticipated. For patients with AF on warfarin who are holding warfarin for a surgery or procedure, except in patients with mechanical valve or recent stroke or TIA, bridging anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin should not be administered.

### Periprocedural thromboprophylaxis in patients receiving chronic anticoagulation therapy [^10d22ff0]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Patients receiving chronic anticoagulation therapy pose a clinical challenge when therapy needs to be interrupted for surgical or invasive procedures. Maintaining anticoagulation places them at risk for serious bleeding complications, whereas discontinuing anticoagulation puts them at risk of thromboembolic complications. Most patients can undergo dental procedures, cataract surgery, and diagnostic endoscopy without discontinuing anticoagulation. The main patient groups that may require a periprocedural alternative to oral anticoagulation (periprocedural thromboprophylaxis or bridging) include patients with prosthetic heart valves, atrial fibrillation, and hypercoagulable states and patients with chronic venous thrombosis who are undergoing surgery. Currently, there is little consensus on the appropriate perioperative treatment of patients on long-term warfarin therapy. There are an increasing number of studies that evaluate the benefits of periprocedural bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in place of unfractionated heparin (UFH). An advantage of LMWH over UFH is that perioperative conversion from warfarin therapy with LMWH can be carried out in the outpatient setting, which is more convenient for patients and is cost effective. As with the use of UFH, there are reports of maternal thromboembolic complications with LMWHs in pregnant women with mechanical heart valves. This review brings together the available data on periprocedural bridging to assess the available options for patients on long-term warfarin therapy who are undergoing surgical procedures. It provides a rationale for using LMWHs while individualizing the risks versus benefits in a given patient population.

A causal relationship between bridging anticoagulation and studied outcomes cannot be confirmed as these findings are based on an observational study. Lastly, although as many confounding factors as possible were taken into account, such as comorbidities and concomitant medications, the confounding effect of unmeasured and/or unknown factors cannot be ruled out. However, our results should not be affected by diagnostic biases since databases to define bridging status and end points are completely independent.

### The effect of heparin infusion intensity on outcomes for bridging hospitalized patients with atrial fibrillation [^0451dd7d]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Perioperative bridging in atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with low thromboembolic rates but high bleeding rates. Recent guidance cautions the practice of bridging except in high risk patients. However, the practice of bridging varies widely and little data exist regarding appropriate anticoagulation intensity when using intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH).

Hypothesis

To determine if high intensity UFH infusion regimens are associated with increased bleeding rates compared to low intensity regimens for bridging patients with AF.

Methods

We conducted a single center retrospective cohort study of admitted patients with non‐valvular AF receiving UFH for ≥ 24 hours. UFH intensities were chosen at the providers' discretion. The primary endpoint was the rate of bleeding defined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis during UFH infusion or within 24 hours of discontinuation. The secondary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular events, arterial thromboembolism, venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarctions and death during UFH infusion.

Results

A total of 497 patients were included in this analysis. Warfarin was used in 82.1% and direct acting oral anticoagulants in 14.1% of patients. The rate of any bleed was higher among high intensity compared to low intensity UFH regimens (10.5% vs 4.9%, odds ratio = 2.29, 95% confidence interval = 1.07‐4.90). Major bleeding was significantly higher among high intensity compared to low intensity UFH regimens. There was no difference in composite thrombotic events or death.

Conclusions

Low intensity UFH infusions, targeting lower anticoagulation targets, were associated with decreased bleeding rates without a signal of increased thromboembolic events in hospitalized AF patients.

Clinical Question Is bridging warfarin before screening colonoscopy in patients with atrial fibrillation beneficial for reducing the risk of stroke. Evidence-Based Answer A limited number of trials that examined the risk of temporary interruption of anticoagulation before a variety of procedures did not find a reduction in the risk of stroke, but they did show an increased risk of bleeding events and venous thromboembolism in patients who were bridged during warfarin interruption. Consensus guidelines recommend bridging based on individual patient risk of VTE.

Evidence Summary A 2016 meta-analysis investigated the risks and benefits of bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin during temporary interruption of warfarin therapy in 13, 810 patients with atrial fibrillation. A 2017 prospective cohort study using a database of Swedish residents receiving anticoagulation examined differences in outcomes between those who were and were not bridged with LMWH during temporary interruption of therapy. 2 The duration of warfarin interruption differed between the groups; the average duration for the bridged group was 5. 4 days vs.
7. 5 days for the non-bridged group. A subset of patients included in the study were receiving anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation; within this subset, there was an increased risk of VTE among those who received LMWH bridging.

3 Rates of postpolypectomy bleeding were higher among patients who received heparin bridging during the procedure compared with those who did not. Four of the five studies independently demonstrated the same finding. In 2017, the American College of Cardiology published an expert consensus decision pathway for periprocedural management of anticoagulation in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. 4 For patients receiving a vitamin K antagonist, the recommendation for bridging is stratified by VTE risk.

Periprocedural anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation when uninterrupted therapy is not feasible — interruption and resumption: If a procedure cannot be performed safely on uninterrupted anticoagulation, temporary cessation of oral anticoagulation without bridging is recommended (1) excluding those with recent stroke or TIA or a mechanical valve; the timing of interruption of direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) should be guided by the specific agent, renal function, and the bleeding risk (1); bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin should not be administered except in patients with a mechanical valve or recent stroke or TIA (3: Harm); and resumption of anticoagulation is the day after low bleeding risk surgery and between the evening of the second day and the evening of the third day after high bleeding risk surgery (2a).

Perioperative bridging of anticoagulation management (Table 4) specifies timing for medication holds, resumption, and bridging with low–molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH). For high thromboembolic risk on warfarin, "Give last dose 6 d before operation, bridge with LMWH or UFH, resume 24 h postoperatively"; for direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), use "Give last dose 3 d before operation, * resume 2–3 d postoperatively" for high bleeding risk procedures and "Give last dose 2 d before operation, * resume 24 h postoperatively" for low bleeding risk procedures. For intermediate thromboembolic risk on warfarin, "determine need for bridging by clinician judgment and current evidence" with "Give last dose 6 d before operation" and "resume 24 h postoperatively"; DOAC timing mirrors these high- and low-bleeding risk schedules. For low thromboembolic risk on warfarin, "bridging not recommended" with "Give last dose 6 d before operation" and "resume 24 h postoperatively"; DOAC timing is the same as above. For dabigatran with creatinine clearance (CrCl) " ≤ 50 mL/min", the footnote directs that "the last dose should be given 3 days before the procedure for low bleeding risk surgery, and 4 to 5 days before the procedure for high bleeding risk operation".

### The effect of heparin infusion intensity on outcomes for bridging hospitalized patients with atrial fibrillation [^fe33ad46]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Perioperative bridging in atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with low thromboembolic rates but high bleeding rates. Recent guidance cautions the practice of bridging except in high risk patients. However, the practice of bridging varies widely and little data exist regarding appropriate anticoagulation intensity when using intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH).

Hypothesis

To determine if high intensity UFH infusion regimens are associated with increased bleeding rates compared to low intensity regimens for bridging patients with AF.

Methods

We conducted a single center retrospective cohort study of admitted patients with non-valvular AF receiving UFH for ≥ 24hours. UFH intensities were chosen at the providers' discretion. The primary endpoint was the rate of bleeding defined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis during UFH infusion or within 24hours of discontinuation. The secondary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular events, arterial thromboembolism, venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarctions and death during UFH infusion.

Results

A total of 497 patients were included in this analysis. Warfarin was used in 82.1% and direct acting oral anticoagulants in 14.1% of patients. The rate of any bleed was higher among high intensity compared to low intensity UFH regimens (10.5% vs 4.9%, odds ratio = 2.29, 95% confidence interval = 1.07–4.90). Major bleeding was significantly higher among high intensity compared to low intensity UFH regimens. There was no difference in composite thrombotic events or death.

Conclusions

Low intensity UFH infusions, targeting lower anticoagulation targets, were associated with decreased bleeding rates without a signal of increased thromboembolic events in hospitalized AF patients.

In patients receiving VKA therapy for VTE as the sole clinical indication who require VKA interruption for an elective surgery/procedure, we suggest against heparin bridging (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence). In patients receiving VKA therapy who require a pacemaker or ICD implantation, we recommend continuation of VKA over VKA interruption and heparin bridging (Strong Recommendation, Moderate Certainty of Evidence). For colonoscopy with anticipated polypectomy that requires VKA interruption, we suggest against heparin bridging during the period of VKA interruption (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence).

Perioperative antithrombotic management — patients on warfarin: Preoperatively, discontinue warfarin at least 5 days before elective procedure; assess international normalized ratio (INR) 1–2 d prior to surgery and, if > 1.5, consider 1–2 mg oral vitamin K; for urgent surgery/procedure, consider 2.5–5 mg oral or IV vitamin K, and for immediate reversal consider prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) and fresh frozen plasma. For high thromboembolic risk, bridge with therapeutic subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) (preferred) or intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH); the last dose of preoperative LMWH is administered 24 h before surgery with half of the daily dose and intravenous heparin is discontinued 4–6 h before surgery; no bridging is necessary for patients at low risk of thromboembolism. Postoperatively, patients at low risk resume warfarin on POD; for high-risk patients who received preoperative bridging, resume therapeutic LMWH 24 h after minor procedures or, after major procedures, resume therapeutic LMWH 48–72 h postoperatively or administer low-dose LMWH, and assess bleeding risk and adequacy of hemostasis when considering timing of resumption of LMWH or UFH.

### Single-arm study of bridging therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin for patients at risk of arterial embolism who require temporary interruption of warfarin [^2507492b]. Circulation (2004). Low credibility.

Background

When warfarin is interrupted for surgery, low-molecular-weight heparin is often used as bridging therapy. However, this practice has never been evaluated in a large prospective study. This study was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of bridging therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin initiated out of hospital.

Methods and Results

This was a prospective, multicenter, single-arm cohort study of patients at high risk of arterial embolism (prosthetic valves and atrial fibrillation with a major risk factor). Warfarin was held for 5 days preoperatively. Low-molecular-weight heparin was given 3 days preoperatively and at least 4 days postoperatively. Patients were followed up for 3 months for thromboembolism and bleeding. Eleven Canadian tertiary care academic centers participated; 224 patients were enrolled. Eight patients (3.6%; 95% CI, 1.8 to 6.9) had an episode of thromboembolism, of which 2 (0.9%; 95% CI, 0.2 to 3.2) were judged to be due to cardioembolism. Of these 8 episodes of thromboembolism, 6 occurred in patients who had warfarin deferred or withdrawn because of bleeding. There were 15 episodes of major bleeding (6.7%; 95% CI, 4.1 to 10.8): 8 occurred intraoperatively or early postoperatively before low-molecular-weight heparin was restarted, 5 occurred in the first postoperative week after low-molecular-weight heparin was restarted, and 2 occurred well after low-molecular-weight heparin was stopped. There were no deaths.

Conclusions

Bridging therapy with subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin is feasible; however, the optimal approach for the management of patients who require temporary interruption of warfarin to have invasive procedures is uncertain.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^93da3229]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Role of low-dose LMWH as VTE prophylaxis in perioperative management — In patients who require perioperative interruption of a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) or a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) and are considered at high risk for post-operative venous thromboembolism (VTE), the need to administer low-dose low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) as VTE prophylaxis may be obviated once the VKA or DOAC is resumed. There may be circumstances when low-dose LMWH can be used in patients at high VTE risk; for example, those having abdominopelvic cancer surgery or hip or knee replacement surgery, and in such hospitalized patients, low-dose LMWH would be started, typically, 12 to 24 hours post-operatively and continued for 2 to 3 days while the VKA takes effect or until resumption of DOAC therapy. The administration of heparin bridging, particularly if only used pre-operatively, does not preclude the administration of post-operative low-dose LMWH (eg, enoxaparin 40 mg daily), including in patients at high risk for bleeding in whom post-operative therapeutic-dose LMWH bridging might be avoided. In patients who resume antiplatelet therapy after a surgery, the addition of low-dose LMWH can be justified in high VTE risk situations but is empiric and should consider the risk of bleeding.

"Alternatively, a direct thrombin or Factor Xa inhibitor can be administered following ablation". "If warfarin was not interrupted before ablation, use of LMWH can be avoided; continue warfarin maintaining INR 2.0–3.0". A "consensus recommendation" states that systemic anticoagulation "is recommended for all patients for at least two months following an AF ablation procedure".

Abstract

The risk and benefit of periprocedural heparin bridging is not completely clarified. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of bridging anticoagulation prior to invasive procedures or surgery. Heparin bridging was associated with lower risks of thromboembolism and bleeding compared to non‐bridging. PubMed, Ovid and Elsevier, and Cochrane Library (2000‐2016) were searched for English‐language studies. Studies comparing interrupted anticoagulation with or without bridging and continuous oral anticoagulation in patients at moderate‐to‐high thromboembolic risk before invasive procedures were included. Primary outcomes were thromboembolic events and bleeding events. Mantel‐Haenszel method and random‐effects models were used to analyze the pooled risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for thromboembolic and bleeding risks. Eighteen studies (six randomized controlled trials and 12 cohort studies) were included (N = 23 364). There was no difference in thromboembolic risk between bridged and non‐bridged patients (RR: 1.26, 95% CI: 0.61‐2.58; RCTs: RR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.23‐2.24; cohorts: RR: 1.45, 95% CI: 0.63‐3.37). However, bridging anticoagulation was associated with higher risk of overall bleeding (RR: 2.83, 95% CI: 2.00‐4.01; RCTs: RR: 2.24, 95% CI: 0.99‐5.09; cohorts: RR: 3.09, 95% CI: 2.07‐4.62) and major bleeding (RR: 3.00, 95% CI: 1.78‐5.06; RCTs: RR: 2.48, 95% CI: 1.29‐4.76; cohorts: RR: 3.22, 95% CI: 1.65‐6.32). Bridging anticoagulation was associated with increased bleeding risk compared to non‐bridging. Thromboembolism risk was similar between two strategies. Our results do not support routine use of bridging during anticoagulation interruption.

### Outcomes in patients undergoing periprocedural interruption of warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants [^cde608f9]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), which include apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban, are now first‐line therapy for treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF). Many patients taking chronic anticoagulant therapy will require temporary interruption for a surgical procedure. Management of the anticoagulant in the perioperative period can be complicated because the pharmacokinetic properties of each agent differ, most significantly as compared with warfarin.

Because of its long half‐life, warfarin is often interrupted several days before the procedure. For patients with a high risk of thrombotic complications, "bridging" therapy with low molecular weight heparin or other short‐acting parenteral anticoagulants are frequently used while the anticoagulant activity of warfarin wanes or returns to therapeutic range. This practice, however, is associated with higher risk of bleeding compared with those in whom bridging therapy was not initiated. In contrast to warfarin, DOACs have both a short half‐life and rapid onset of action, which make them ideal for perioperative use and removes the necessity of bridging anticoagulation. Prior studies have compared postoperative outcomes of patients following the perioperative interruption of DOACs vs. warfarin and found no major differences in postoperative rates of major bleeding or thromboembolic events. However, because these were post hoc analyses of clinical trials, the patient samples include a more selective population that is commonly seen in routine clinical practice. Therefore, we aimed to compare 30‐day postoperative bleeding and thromboembolic events associated with DOAC versus warfarin management in the perioperative period in a practice‐based cohort of patients.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline: reconstruction after skin cancer resection [^0123b637]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Perioperative anticoagulation management during reconstruction after skin cancer resection should be individualized because risks vary by indication. The risks involved in cessation of anticoagulants may differ significantly according to the indications for which they are prescribed; in some cases, continuation is essential (i.e., recent placement of drug-eluting cardiac stent), and cessation can have serious or fatal consequences, whereas for other indications a brief perioperative interruption may not have negative effects. A large cohort study of atrial fibrillation patients on warfarin found no increase in thromboembolism in those undergoing surgery without anticoagulation compared with heparin bridging. Decision-making should involve the surgeon, the physician managing the anticoagulation, and the patient; reversible agents used in bridging provide flexibility when bleeding events occur and may be a safer alternative, although some patients at significant thromboembolism risk may need to continue therapy. Consultation with the primary physician, cardiologist, or other prescribing clinician is helpful, and evidence outside aspirin and warfarin is limited; the irreversibility and risks of newer agents are difficult to evaluate due to a lack of available data.

Bridging of anticoagulant therapy

Unfractionated heparin (UFH) and LMWH (LMWH) have short half lives compared with warfarin and can be employed as an anticoagulation 'bridge' while warfarin is temporarily discontinued for endoscopic procedures considered to have a significant risk of haemorrhage. UFH is administered by continuous intravenous infusion and LMWH by subcutaneous injection once or two times a day. The former requires an inpatient stay in hospital while warfarin is discontinued, and then re-introduced, and also requires frequent monitoring of aPTT; the latter can often be managed in an outpatient setting without monitoring of anticoagulation levels. Some cardiologists have a preference for UFH for bridging warfarin in patients with metal heart valves. A meta-analysis demonstrated higher rates of bleeding in patients with mechanical heart valves bridged with LMWH versus UFH, but numbers were small in the LMWH studies. A small multicentre registry study found no difference in adverse events between patients bridged with UFH or LMWH in this context, and bridging with LMWH is now commonplace. Guidelines from the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology do not recommend one strategy over the other. Prosthetic metal heart valves in the mitral position are at particularly high risk of thrombosis if warfarin is temporarily discontinued for 5–7 days. Heparin bridging for patients with a bileaflet mechanical aortic valve replacement in the absence of AF is considered unnecessary in guidelines from the British Society of Haematologyand from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, but it is recommended in guidelines from the ESC and the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery. There are no high quality studies to inform us, and consequently levels of evidence are low quality in all three guidelines. We have now placed mechanical aortic valve replacement in the high-risk category requiring bridging, in line with European guidelines, but this should be decided in conjunction with local cardiology or cardiothoracic surgery services given the uncertainty. This should always be discussed with the consultant cardiologist responsible for the patient's care.

### The perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^e83776f1]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

This article discusses the perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy and is part of the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). The primary objectives of this article are the following: (1) to address the perioperative management of patients who are receiving vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or antiplatelet drugs, such as aspirin and clopidogrel, and require an elective surgical or other invasive procedures; and (2) to address the perioperative use of bridging anticoagulation, typically with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH). A secondary objective is to address the perioperative management of such patients who require urgent surgery. The recommendations in this article incorporate the grading system that is discussed in this supplement (Guyatt G et al, CHEST 2008; 133:123S-131S). Briefly, Grade 1 recommendations are considered strong and indicate that the benefits do (or do not) outweigh risks, burden, and costs, whereas Grade 2 recommendations are referred to as suggestions and imply that individual patient values may lead to different management choices. The key recommendations in this article include the following: in patients with a mechanical heart valve or atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism (VTE) at high risk for thromboembolism, we recommend bridging anticoagulation with therapeutic-dose subcutaneous (SC) LMWH or IV UFH over no bridging during temporary interruption of VKA therapy (Grade 1C); in patients with a mechanical heart valve or atrial fibrillation or VTE at moderate risk for thromboembolism, we suggest bridging anticoagulation with therapeutic-dose SC LMWH, therapeutic-dose IV UFH, or low-dose SC LMWH over no bridging during temporary interruption of VKA therapy (Grade 2C); in patients with a mechanical heart valve or atrial fibrillation or VTE at low risk for thromboembolism, we suggest low-dose SC LMWH or no bridging over bridging with therapeutic-dose SC LMWH or IV UFH (Grade 2C). In patients with a bare metal coronary stent who require surgery within 6 weeks of stent placement, we recommend continuing aspirin and clopidogrel in the perioperative period (Grade 1C); in patients with a drug-eluting coronary stent who require surgery within 12 months of stent placement, we recommend continuing aspirin and clopidogrel in the perioperative period (Grade 1C). In patients who are undergoing minor dental procedures and are receiving VKAs, we recommend continuing VKAs around the time of the procedure and co-administering an oral prohemostatic agent (Grade 1B); in patients who are undergoing minor dermatologic procedures and are receiving VKAs, we recommend continuing VKAs around the time of the procedure (Grade 1C); in patients who are undergoing cataract removal and are receiving VKAs, we recommend continuing VKAs around the time of the procedure (Grade 1C).

### Anticoagulation of patients on chronic warfarin undergoing arrhythmia device surgery: wide variability of perioperative bridging in Canada [^053dd4f2]. Heart Rhythm (2009). Low credibility.

Background

In patients undergoing cardiac rhythm device surgery, it is common practice to discontinue oral anticoagulation and to perform heparin bridging in order to reduce the risk of bleeding and minimize the risk of thromboembolic events.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine the perioperative anticoagulation strategies currently in use.

Methods

A survey presented four clinical scenarios of patients on oral anticoagulation undergoing cardiac rhythm device surgery. The scenarios represented a gradient of perceived thromboembolic risk based on the presence of atrial fibrillation, a mechanical heart valve, previous stroke, and the remainder of the CHADS(2) risk factors (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age > 75 years, diabetes, previous stroke or transient ischemic attack). Respondents were offered six options that included discontinuing oral anticoagulation without heparin, three different heparin bridging protocols, and ongoing oral anticoagulation with reduced or therapeutic dose warfarin.

Results

Based on responses from 38 (61%) of 62 electrophysiologists surveyed across Canada, 83% of respondents held warfarin without bridging in a low-risk, 78-year-old patient with atrial fibrillation (CHADS(2) score 1). In three higher-risk patient scenarios, 67% to 100% of respondents chose heparin bridging or ongoing warfarin; 38% to 72% of respondents chose heparin bridging, with 23% to 36% choosing variable use of ongoing warfarin. In all three cases where respondents indicated that they would bridge, each of the three heparin regimens was chosen by at least 20% of respondents.

Conclusion

There is a wide range of approaches to perioperative management in patients on oral anticoagulation undergoing cardiac rhythm device surgery. Clinical equipoise is evident and supports the need for comparative studies.

### LMWH for perioperative anticoagulation in patients on chronic warfarin therapy [^382b0e30]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To review current data regarding low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) use for perioperative anticoagulation in patients receiving chronic warfarin therapy.

Data Sources

Data were obtained from the Sixth American College of Chest Physicians Consensus Conference on Antithrombotic Therapy guidelines and a MEDLINE search (1996-January 2003). Search terms included heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, warfarin, perioperative care, and anticoagulants.

Data Synthesis

Heparin is the most common agent used as bridge therapy for perioperative anticoagulation in patients on chronic warfarin therapy; LMWHs are also used. Studies that evaluated enoxaparin and/or dalteparin were reviewed.

Conclusions

Although published studies demonstrate efficacy and safety of LMWHs, more data are needed to support their use as bridge therapy.

### Postoperative low molecular weight heparin bridging treatment for patients at high risk of arterial thromboembolism (PERIOP2): double blind randomised controlled trial [^aae348b4]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Uncertainty remains as to whether patients with atrial fibrillation or mechanical heart valves who require interruption of vitamin K antagonists for invasive procedures benefit from bridging with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) after the procedure. Many published and diverse protocols and guidelines have sought to address this common clinical problem, and the concern has always been that these patients are at high risk of thrombotic complications caused by a procoagulable state while off vitamin K antagonists.

In the typical bridging strategy, warfarin is held for four or five days before the procedure and is resumed after the procedure, on the same day or one or two days later.LMWH is given once or twice a day at a therapeutic dose for three to five days before the procedure and for a minimum of four days after the procedure until the international normalised ratio (INR) is therapeutic. The goal of bridging with LMWH is to reduce the risk of perioperative thromboembolism by minimising the time without anticoagulation while reducing bleeding risks with a short acting anticoagulant that allows for minimal or no anticoagulant effect at the time of interruption.

Bridging has been most studied in patients with atrial fibrillation in several observational or single armed studies. A recently completed double blind placebo controlled trial suggested that LMWH bridging is not necessary before or after the procedure for patients on warfarin. However, patients with mechanical heart valves were usually excluded from such studies and patients with atrial fibrillation at high risk of stroke were not well represented. In a previous single arm, multicentre pilot study of dalteparin bridging given once daily to 224 patients with atrial fibrillation or mechanical heart valves, we found that the rate of thrombosis after the procedure was 3.1%; 75% of the events occurred in patients who had anticoagulation held due to a bleeding event after the procedure. These findings suggest that bridging after the procedure caused harm potentially because of a longer period without anticoagulation due to bleeding, which then led to thrombotic events.

Based on this information we performed a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial to assess the necessity of postoperative bridging with the LMWH dalteparin in patients with atrial fibrillation or prosthetic mechanical valves who required warfarin to be held for a procedure. We hypothesised that patients who would receive placebo after the procedure would have fewer bleeding events and a lower rate of thromboembolism because of the association of thromboembolism with bleeding in our pilot study. We chose to only study the LMWH dose after the procedure because the dose before the procedure was unlikely to be causing harm and might be of benefit.

Several reasons may explain this. First, recommendations in guidelines 9, 10, 12 and summaries of product characteristics 14, 15 do not strongly advise against bridging therapy. Indeed, several health professionals have criticized the lack of clarity of these guidelines. 17, 18, 19, 42, 43

Second, it may be possible that some physicians continue to believe in the theoretical possibility of a transient hypercoagulable state when starting VKA therapy due to the difference in plasma half‐life between vitamin K–dependent coagulation factors (II, VII, IX, and X) and proteins C and S, which are important components in coagulation inhibition. A rapid decrease in protein C and S levels may lead to thrombotic occlusions of the microvasculature resulting in necrosis, particularly of the skin. 44 Unlike our study, results from a nested case–control study conducted on AF patients using the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink supported this theory, since Azoulay et al found a 71% increased risk of stroke in the first 30 days of warfarin use compared with nonuse, whereas a decreased risk was observed after 30 days of use. 45 However, this theory does not justify the routine use of bridging therapy since VKA‐induced skin necrosis occurs mostly in patients with inherited or acquired thrombophilia, such as protein C or S deficiencies, 44 and several case studies have also reported that LMWH can also lead to skin necrosis. 46, 47 Lastly, there is insufficient evidence justifying systematic use of bridging therapy. This study showed that bridging therapy was associated with an increased risk of bleeding without any beneficial effect, and only 1 study conducted on 5327 patients in hospital settings was found that could put our results into perspective. 16 Kim et al reported bleeding and stroke rates of 1.0% and 0.3%, while in our study they were 0.35% to 0.17%, respectively. The lower rates here may lie in the difference between the study settings, (ie, our analytic sample managed in outpatient care may be healthier than hospitalized patients). Despite the different incidence rates, Kim et al 16 found results similar to ours for bleeding and stroke risks: they observed an increased bleeding risk associated with bridging therapy (odds ratio 4.44, 95% CI 1.68–11.72) and a comparable stroke risk between bridged and nonbridged groups.
