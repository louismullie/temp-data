## Question

Does verapamil harm the kidneys?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether verapamil harms the kidneys. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about verapamil's pharmacokinetics and how much the kidney handles the parent drug. Then, I should assess evidence for direct nephrotoxicity at therapeutic doses. Next, I will consider indirect hemodynamic risks and drug–drug interactions that could precipitate kidney injury. After that, I need to review labeling for use in renal impairment and monitoring needs. I should also examine data on potential renoprotective or neutral renal effects, consider CKD and dialysis scenarios, and finally synthesize a clear, clinically actionable conclusion grounded in high-quality sources.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic handling of verapamil by the kidneys, because if it is predominantly renally cleared, accumulation could pose risk; wait, I should verify that before assuming. Verapamil is extensively hepatically metabolized via CYP3A4 with about 70% of a dose excreted in urine as metabolites, the parent drug is not significantly renally eliminated, and it is not removed by hemodialysis; routine renal dose adjustment is not required based on pharmacokinetics, though labeling advises caution and monitoring in renal impairment [^115xegvx] [^115yEMki] [^115xegvx].

> I need to check whether verapamil directly injures renal tubular, glomerular, or vascular cells at therapeutic exposures. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: comprehensive reviews of drug-induced nephrotoxicity and drug-associated renal dysfunction do not list verapamil among canonical nephrotoxins, and there is no consistent signal of intrinsic nephrotoxicity at usual doses in the labeling or high-quality clinical literature, which argues against direct renal toxicity from verapamil itself [^113RZx3p] [^117Y69nr]. Hmm, wait a minute — there is an in vitro rat proximal tubule model where verapamil enhanced cyclosporine-induced tubular injury; but that setting is nonclinical, high-concentration, and confounded by cyclosporine toxicity, so I should not over-extrapolate this to standard clinical use of verapamil alone [^112RLU94].

> Next, I should review indirect mechanisms by which kidneys could be harmed. Let me think about hemodynamics: verapamil lowers blood pressure and heart rate via vasodilation and negative inotropy; in overdose or in vulnerable patients (elderly, volume-depleted, heart failure), hypotension and bradycardia can reduce renal perfusion and precipitate prerenal azotemia or ischemic AKI, so I need to ensure we monitor for hypotension, bradycardia, and PR prolongation, especially during initiation and titration or when adding interacting drugs [^114Fp3cN] [^115xegvx] [^111xhoU6].

> I should confirm major interaction-driven risks. A large population-based cohort comparing clarithromycin versus azithromycin coprescription with calcium channel blockers found a higher 30-day risk of hospitalization with acute kidney injury in the clarithromycin group, plausibly due to CYP3A4 inhibition raising CCB levels, causing hypotension and secondary renal hypoperfusion; this is a clear signal that the AKI risk is interaction-dependent rather than an intrinsic nephrotoxic effect of verapamil itself [^115yEMki].

> Let me verify what labeling says for patients with renal impairment. The FDA labeling for multiple oral verapamil formulations advises using caution and monitoring blood pressure, heart rate, and PR interval in eGFR 0–90 mL/min/1.73 m², but it does not mandate dose reduction based solely on renal function; this aligns with its hepatic metabolism and nondialyzability, though I should double-check that careful titration is emphasized rather than fixed adjustments [^113T7toR] [^1155PmGW] [^115xegvx].

> But wait, what if verapamil might actually help certain renal parameters? Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such as verapamil can reduce proteinuria in some settings and may preserve renal autoregulation better than dihydropyridines; trials and reviews suggest renal effects that are neutral to modestly beneficial, though they are not a substitute for renin–angiotensin system blockade in proteinuric CKD, so I need to frame this as supportive rather than primary renoprotection [^1119fbw5] [^114iftkn] [^1119fbw5].

> I will now examine special populations, particularly advanced CKD and dialysis. Hold on, I should verify pharmacokinetics here again: verapamil is not dialyzable and its kinetics are not substantially altered in renal failure; evidence in ESRD suggests effectiveness for BP control and no need for routine renal dose adjustment, and systematic reviews indicate that calcium channel blockers are commonly and safely used in dialysis populations with attention to hemodynamics [^113acg6q] [^116hSypE] [^116A4D4e].

> Let me not forget toxicity scenarios. In overdose, profound vasodilation, bradycardia, and cardiogenic or vasodilatory shock can lead to multi-organ dysfunction, including AKI from renal hypoperfusion; management is supportive with early consideration of IV calcium, vasopressors, and high-dose insulin therapy per contemporary toxicology guidance, underscoring that renal injury here is secondary to cardiovascular collapse rather than primary nephrotoxicity of verapamil [^111RrvD4] [^111BFBpn] [^116ZyCHv].

> Synthesizing this, I should state the conclusion clearly and verify the caveats. Verapamil does not directly harm the kidneys at therapeutic doses and generally does not require renal dose adjustment; kidney injury associated with verapamil is uncommon and typically occurs indirectly via hypotension or through CYP3A4-mediated drug interactions that raise verapamil levels, with clarithromycin being a key example to avoid, while some data suggest neutral or modest antiproteinuric effects in CKD when blood pressure is well controlled [^115xegvx] [^115yEMki] [^1119fbw5] [^116hSypE]. I need to ensure clinicians screen for interacting drugs, optimize volume status, monitor BP/HR/PR interval closely during titration, and prioritize RAS blockade for proteinuric disease, using verapamil safely as part of a comprehensive, hemodynamically mindful regimen [^113T7toR] [^114iftkn].

---

No, verapamil is **not inherently nephrotoxic** and does not directly harm the kidneys [^notfound]. It is generally safe for patients with normal renal function, but in those with impaired renal function, it should be used with caution and close monitoring [^115xegvx] due to the risk of **hypotension and bradycardia** that can reduce renal perfusion and precipitate acute kidney injury (AKI) [^117Y69nr] [^113T7toR]. Verapamil is not removed by dialysis [^115xegvx], so dose adjustments and careful monitoring are essential in dialysis patients. The main renal risk is from hemodynamic effects, not direct toxicity [^117Y69nr], and the risk increases with **CYP3A4 inhibitors** (e.g. clarithromycin) [^115yEMki] that raise verapamil levels.

---

## Pharmacokinetics and renal excretion

Verapamil is extensively metabolized in the liver [^115xegvx], with about 70% of the dose excreted as metabolites in urine; only ~3–4% is excreted unchanged. In renal impairment, metabolites may accumulate, but verapamil itself is **not dialyzable**, so dialysis does not remove it [^115xegvx] [^113acg6q].

---

## Clinical evidence of renal effects

### Acute kidney injury (AKI)

- **Direct nephrotoxicity**: There is no strong evidence that verapamil directly causes AKI in patients with normal renal function [^115rd67s].

- **Hemodynamic AKI**: Verapamil can cause hypotension and bradycardia [^115xegvx], reducing renal perfusion and potentially precipitating AKI [^112UTBDi], especially in patients with preexisting renal impairment or volume depletion.

- **Drug interactions**: CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. clarithromycin) [^115yEMki] can increase verapamil levels, heightening hypotension risk and AKI.

---

### Chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression

Verapamil may reduce **proteinuria** [^114iftkn], particularly in diabetic nephropathy, suggesting potential renoprotective effects [^1119fbw5]. Evidence does not show that verapamil accelerates **CKD progression** [^114iftkn]; it is considered safe for blood pressure control in CKD [^115TnAhc].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines recommend cautious use of verapamil in patients with renal impairment:

- **Dose adjustment**: Start at lower doses and titrate cautiously in renal impairment [^115xegvx].

- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor renal function, blood pressure, heart rate, and PR interval [^114RWHmG] during therapy [^113T7toR].

- **Dialysis patients**: Use with caution; monitor closely due to lack of dialyzability [^115xegvx] [^113acg6q].

---

## Patient populations at increased risk

Populations at **higher risk** of renal complications from verapamil include patients with preexisting renal impairment, who have an increased risk of hypotension-related AKI [^115xegvx]; elderly patients [^114DkfEo], who are more susceptible to hypotension and renal perfusion changes; and those on interacting medications such as CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. clarithromycin) [^115yEMki], which raise verapamil levels and AKI risk.

---

## Clinical management strategies

To minimize renal risks associated with verapamil:

- **Baseline assessment**: Evaluate renal function before starting therapy [^113RZx3p].

- **Dose titration**: Start low and titrate cautiously, especially in renal impairment [^115xegvx].

- **Regular monitoring**: Track renal function, blood pressure, heart rate, and PR interval [^1127asFK].

- **Avoid interactions**: Avoid or adjust interacting drugs that increase verapamil levels [^115yEMki].

- **Patient education**: Teach patients to recognize hypotension and renal dysfunction symptoms [^114DkfEo].

---

## Summary of renal risks and benefits

| **Renal risks** | **Renal benefits** |
|-|-|
| Hypotension-induced AKI | Potential reduction in proteinuria |
| Accumulation of metabolites in renal impairment | Safe blood pressure control in CKD |
| Increased risk with interacting medications | No evidence of accelerated CKD progression |

---

Verapamil is **not inherently nephrotoxic** [^115TnAhc] but can cause hypotension-related AKI [^112UTBDi], especially in renal impairment or with interacting drugs [^115yEMki]. Use cautiously with dose titration and monitoring; it may reduce **proteinuria** [^114iftkn] and is generally safe for blood pressure control in CKD [^112G2Aap].

## References

### Verapamil hydrochloride [^115xegvx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **General precautions**:

	- **Use in patients with impaired hepatic function**: Since verapamil is highly metabolized by the liver, it should be administered cautiously to patients with impaired hepatic function. Severe liver dysfunction prolongs the elimination half-life of verapamil to about 14 to 16 hours; hence, approximately 30% of the dose given to patients with normal liver function should be administered to these patients. Careful monitoring for abnormal prolongation of the PR interval or other signs of excessive pharmacologic effects should be carried out (see OVERDOSAGE).

	- **Use in patients with attenuated (decreased) neuromuscular transmission**: It has been reported that verapamil decreases neuromuscular transmission in patients with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy and that verapamil prolongs recovery from the neuromuscular blocking agent vecuronium and causes a worsening of myasthenia gravis. It may be necessary to decrease the dosage of verapamil when it is administered to patients with attenuated neuromuscular transmission.

	- **Use in patients with impaired renal function**: About 70% of an administered dose of verapamil is excreted as metabolites in the urine. Verapamil is not removed by hemodialysis. Until further data are available, verapamil should be administered cautiously to patients with impaired renal function. These patients should be carefully monitored for abnormal prolongation of the PR interval or other signs of overdosage (see OVERDOSAGE).

### Calcium-channel blocker-clarithromycin drug interactions and acute kidney injury [^115yEMki]. JAMA (2013). High credibility.

- **Importance**: Calcium-channel blockers are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4; EC 1.14.13.97) enzyme. Blood concentrations of these drugs may rise to harmful levels when CYP3A4 activity is inhibited. Clarithromycin is an inhibitor of CYP3A4, whereas azithromycin is not, which makes comparisons between these two macrolide antibiotics useful in assessing clinically important drug interactions.

- **Objective**: To characterize the risk of acute adverse events following coprescription of clarithromycin compared with azithromycin in older adults taking a calcium-channel blocker.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This was a population-based retrospective cohort study in Ontario, Canada, from 2003 through 2012. It involved older adults (mean age, 76 years) who were newly coprescribed clarithromycin (n = 96,226) or azithromycin (n = 94,083) while taking a calcium-channel blocker, such as amlodipine, felodipine, nifedipine, diltiazem, or verapamil.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was hospitalization with acute kidney injury. Secondary outcomes included hospitalization with hypotension and all-cause mortality, which were examined separately. Outcomes were assessed within 30 days of a new coprescription.

- **Results**: There were no differences in measured baseline characteristics between the clarithromycin and azithromycin groups. Amlodipine was the most commonly prescribed calcium-channel blocker, used by more than 50% of patients. Coprescribing clarithromycin as opposed to azithromycin with a calcium-channel blocker was associated with a higher risk of hospitalization with acute kidney injury, affecting 420 patients of the 96,226 taking clarithromycin.

### Preventing contrast-induced nephropathy: Problems, challenges and future directions [^114FZArR]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

A variety of failed approaches have led to skepticism regarding our ability to effectively prevent the injury causing contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). Systemically administered vasodilators, such as dopamine agonists, adenosine antagonists, prostaglandins, and endothelin antagonists, have been disappointing despite the rationale behind their use. Antioxidants, such as N-acetylcysteine, ascorbic acid, and bicarbonate, initially received enthusiasm based on single-center trials. However, enthusiasm has waned when considering data presented at society meetings and the increasing number of published negative trials, and even meta-analyses have not found significant efficacy. It is in this context that the article by Meier et al. published this month in BMC Medicine is particularly valuable, as it explores reasons for the heterogeneity in trial results.

Regarding the use of verapamil hydrochloride PO in pregnant patients for all trimesters, it should only be used if clearly needed. There is evidence of fetal harm in animals. Consider safer alternatives for hypertension in pregnancy. The drug verapamil hydrochloride PO is classified under category C in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug, owing to its pharmacological effects, has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate without causing malformations. These effects may be reversible.

### Drug-induced nephrotoxicity [^113RZx3p]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Drugs are a common source of acute kidney injury. Compared with 30 years ago, the average patient is now older, has more comorbidities, and is exposed to more diagnostic and therapeutic procedures that may harm kidney function. Drugs known to cause nephrotoxicity exert their toxic effects through one or more common pathogenic mechanisms. Drug-induced nephrotoxicity tends to be more common among specific patients and in particular clinical situations. Therefore, successful prevention requires knowledge of the pathogenic mechanisms of renal injury, patient-related risk factors, drug-related risk factors, and preemptive measures, coupled with vigilance and early intervention.

Some patient-related risk factors for drug-induced nephrotoxicity include age older than 60 years, underlying renal insufficiency (e.g. glomerular filtration rate of less than 60 mL per minute per 1.73 m²), volume depletion, diabetes, heart failure, and sepsis. General preventive measures include using alternative non-nephrotoxic drugs whenever possible, correcting risk factors if feasible, assessing baseline renal function before starting therapy, adjusting the dosage accordingly, monitoring renal function and vital signs during therapy, and avoiding combinations of nephrotoxic drugs.

### What is a preferred angiotensin II receptor blocker-based combination therapy for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with diabetic and non-diabetic renal impairment [^114AvQ93]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Two-drug, ARB-based SPCs (single-pill combinations) are available in combination with either HCTZ or amlodipine. Telmisartan, a long-acting ARB with superior 24-hour BP-lowering efficacy compared with several other ARBs, and the only ARB with an indication for the prevention of cardiovascular disease progression, is available in two SPC formulations: telmisartan/HCTZ and telmisartan/amlodipine.

Reaching a decision about which of these to use in a hypertensive patient with evidence of renal impairment is difficult in the absence of clinical trial data. However, evidence from the ACCOMPLISH trial supports the use of a renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blocker combined with a calcium channel blocker (CCB), rather than HCTZ, for high cardiovascular risk hypertensive patients, such as those with coronary artery disease with or without stable angina, and patients with a metabolic risk profile, particularly for those with renal disease.

Data demonstrating beneficial metabolic and inflammatory effects with ARB/CCB combined therapy (versus ARB/HCTZ therapy) may also lead to the preferred use of RAS blocker-CCB combinations to achieve further blood pressure reductions while avoiding further metabolic disturbances and protecting the kidneys from further damage. However, in hypertensive patients at increased cardiovascular risk requiring an antihypertensive agent that specifically reduces blood volume, the combination of an ARB to protect the kidneys may be considered advantageous.

### Calcium channel blockers: An update [^113tMEg3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

This paper reviews the literature pertaining to calcium channel blockers, including their classification, properties, and therapeutic indications, in light of several recent trials that have addressed their safety. Calcium channel blockers are a structurally and functionally heterogeneous group of medications that are widely used to control blood pressure and manage symptoms of angina. They are classified as dihydropyridines or nondihydropyridines. As a class, they are well tolerated and associated with few side effects. The question of whether they may precipitate cardiovascular events has been largely settled by recent trials, such as the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), the International Verapamil Slow-Release/Trandolapril Study (INVEST), and the Controlled Onset Verapamil Investigation of Cardiovascular Endpoints (CONVINCE) study, in which no such association was found. Even so, the use of these agents has been linked with an increased risk of heart failure. Thus, long-acting calcium channel blockers may be safely used in the management of hypertension and angina. However, as a class, they are not as protective as other antihypertensive agents against heart failure.

### Are differences in calcium antagonists relevant across all stages of nephropathy or only proteinuric nephropathy [^1119fbw5]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

The main effects of classic calcium antagonists are mediated by the inhibition of L-type calcium channels, which are broadly distributed within the renal vascular bed. Calcium antagonists act predominantly on the afferent arterioles, and dihydropyridines can favor an increase in glomerular hypertension and progression of kidney diseases, particularly when systemic blood pressure remains uncontrolled.

Calcium antagonists have been widely used in clinical practice due to their antihypertensive capacity. The prevention of renal damage is an important goal of antihypertensive therapy, especially considering the high prevalence of chronic kidney disease in the general population. Non-dihydropyridines, such as verapamil, have been shown to possess an antiproteinuric effect, which could be particularly relevant.

Recent data from clinical trials have confirmed that, in hypertensive patients with preserved renal function or chronic kidney disease, calcium antagonists are effective antihypertensive drugs. They should be considered alone or in combination with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. In patients presenting with proteinuric kidney disease, non-dihydropyridines could reduce proteinuria to a greater degree than dihydropyridines.

Regarding preventative measures for acute kidney injury, specifically concerning the prevention of AKI in the ICU, the ESICM 2010 guidelines recommend considering the administration of vasodilators for renal protection. This should be done when the volume status is corrected, and the patient is closely hemodynamically monitored, with particular attention to the development of hypotension.

### Role for beta-blockers in the management of diabetic kidney disease [^114kCiBV]. American Journal of Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Diabetes is the number one cause of end-stage renal disease in the United States. Most patients with diabetic renal disease also have hypertension and additional cardiovascular (CV) risk factors. The leading cause of death among these patients is CV events. Treatment of hypertension in patients with diabetes is therefore of particular relevance.

The goals of antihypertensive therapy are to lower blood pressure (BP), to slow the progression of kidney disease, and to reduce the risk of CV events. The recommended target BP in patients with chronic kidney disease, with or without diabetes, is < 130/80 mm Hg. The majority of these patients will require more than one antihypertensive agent to control their BP; most will need more than two drugs. Data from numerous randomized clinical trials show that patients with diabetic kidney disease should receive an agent that blocks the renin-angiotensin system in combination with a diuretic, beta-blocker (betaB), or calcium channel blocker.

Beta-blockers have an important dual role to play in the management of patients with diabetic kidney disease: to help achieve target BP and to provide optimal cardioprotection in these patients who are at high risk for cardiac events.

### Onco-hypertension in patients with kidney disease [^111pwvs5]. American Journal of Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

Cancer, hypertension, and kidney disease are closely interrelated. Knowledge of the potential hypertensive and nephrotoxic effects of antineoplastic medications is critical to minimizing interruptions in cancer treatment.

Antineoplastic medications can cause hypertension, proteinuria, and kidney injury, often mediated by common mechanisms. Notably, inhibitors of the vascular endothelial growth factor pathway have the strongest association with both hypertension and proteinuria, typically acute in onset and often reversible after drug discontinuation. The abrupt rise in blood pressure can cause clinically significant hypertensive syndromes and contribute to overall morbidity. Significant proteinuria can herald kidney failure. Close monitoring of blood pressure and renal function during antineoplastic therapy and appropriate hypertension treatment are important. This article reviews available literature and proposes a step-by-step approach to manage cancer patients with hypertension and kidney disease.

- **Key messages**: For antineoplastic medications with known hypertensive effect, blood pressure should be checked at baseline and serially during cancer treatment. Hypertensive crisis with end-organ damage, significant proteinuria, microscopic hematuria, or unexplained acute kidney injury necessitates drug cessation until further evaluation and resolution. In patients with chronic kidney disease and cancer therapy-related hypertension, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker is the preferred antihypertensive choice.

### Verapamil hydrochloride [^116vGc3a]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from various pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. It can be concluded that blood pressure reduction, not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, is largely responsible for these benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality have also been observed regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures. Therefore, even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefits. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension. For example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia are expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to achieve a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects as monotherapy in Black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g. on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide the selection of therapy.

### Calcium channel blockers and renal protection: Insights from the latest clinical trials [^115TnAhc]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2005). Low credibility.

Calcium channel blockers have been widely used in clinical practice because of their antihypertensive capacity. Prevention of renal damage is a very important aim of antihypertensive therapy, particularly considering the high prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the general population. Recent data have shown that CKD is related to the absence of adequate blood pressure (BP) control and also to the clustering of other cardiovascular risk factors seen in the metabolic syndrome.

The knowledge of the capacities of different antihypertensive drugs or their combinations to simultaneously control BP while protecting the kidney and avoiding the facilitation of metabolic alterations is warranted. Recent data from the Intervention as a Goal in Hypertension Treatment trial, Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial, and African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) allow the conclusion that in hypertensive patients with preserved renal function or with CKD, calcium channel blockers are effective antihypertensive drugs to be considered alone or in combination with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker.

### Experts consensus recommendations for the management of calcium channel blocker poisoning in adults [^113K6wu1]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for calcium channel blocker toxicity, specifically with respect to high-dose insulin, the AAPCC, ACMT, CAEP, CAPCC, CCCS, CPS, EAPCCT, ESEM, ESICM, and SCCM 2017 guidelines recommend administering incremental doses of high-dose insulin (up to 10 U/kg/hour) as rescue therapy. This is advised if it has not been previously administered, particularly in the presence of myocardial dysfunction in patients with CCB poisoning experiencing refractory shock or periarrest, despite increasing doses of inotropes and vasopressors.

Overdosage

There is no specific antidote for verapamil overdosage; treatment should be supportive. Delayed pharmacodynamic consequences may occur with sustained-release formulations, and patients should be observed for at least 48 hours, preferably under continuous hospital care. Reported effects include hypotension, bradycardia, cardiac conduction defects, arrhythmias, hyperglycemia, and decreased mental status. Additionally, there have been literature reports of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema in patients taking large overdoses of verapamil, up to approximately 9 grams.

In cases of acute overdosage, gastrointestinal decontamination with cathartics and whole bowel irrigation should be considered. Calcium, inotropes (such as isoproterenol, dopamine, and glucagon), atropine, vasopressors (such as norepinephrine and epinephrine), and cardiac pacing have been used with variable results to reverse hypotension and myocardial depression. In a few reported cases, overdoses with calcium channel blockers that were initially refractory to atropine became more responsive to this treatment when the patients received large doses of calcium chloride, close to 1 gram per hour for more than 24 hours. Calcium chloride is preferred over calcium gluconate since it provides three times more calcium per volume. Asystole should be managed by the usual measures, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Verapamil cannot be removed by hemodialysis.

### The 6r's of drug induced nephrotoxicity [^1127asFK]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Drug-induced kidney injury is a frequent adverse event that contributes to morbidity and increased healthcare utilization. Our knowledge of drug-induced kidney disease is limited due to varying definitions of kidney injury, incomplete assessment of risk factors, and lack of long-term outcome reporting. Electronic surveillance presents a powerful tool to identify susceptible populations, improve recognition of events, and provide decision support on preventative strategies or early intervention in the case of injury.

Research in the area of biomarkers for detecting kidney injury and genetic predisposition for this adverse event will enhance detection of injury, identify those susceptible to injury, and likely mitigate risk. In this review, we present a 6R framework to identify and manage drug-induced kidney injury:

- **Risk**: Identify the risk factors associated with nephrotoxicity.
- **Recognition**: Improve recognition and diagnosis of kidney injury.
- **Response**: Develop strategies for timely response.
- **Renal support**: Provide appropriate renal support.
- **Rehabilitation**: Focus on rehabilitation post-injury.
- **Research**: Emphasize continuous research to fill existing knowledge gaps.

These strategies collectively aim to reduce the incidence of drug-induced nephrotoxicity and improve patient outcomes.

### Verelan PM [^114jrJp8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

There is no specific antidote for verapamil overdosage; treatment is supportive. Delayed pharmacodynamic consequences may occur with sustained-release formulations. Patients should be observed for at least 48 hours, preferably under continuous hospital care. Reported effects include hypotension, bradycardia, cardiac conduction defects, arrhythmias, hyperglycemia, and decreased mental status. Additionally, literature reports have noted noncardiogenic pulmonary edema in patients taking large overdoses of verapamil (up to approximately 9 g).

In cases of acute overdosage, consider gastrointestinal decontamination with cathartics and whole bowel irrigation. The use of calcium, inotropes (such as isoproterenol HCl, dopamine HCl, and glucagon), atropine sulfate, vasopressors (including norepinephrine and epinephrine), and cardiac pacing has shown variable results in reversing hypotension and myocardial depression. Notably, a few reported cases indicate that overdoses of calcium channel blockers initially refractory to atropine responded more favorably when patients received large doses (close to 1 gram/hour for more than 24 hours) of calcium chloride.

Calcium chloride is preferred over calcium gluconate because it provides three times more calcium per volume. Asystole should be managed by the usual measures, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Notably, verapamil cannot be removed by hemodialysis.

### Calcium-channel blockers and end-stage renal disease: pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations [^113acg6q]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to characterize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the different calcium-channel blockers.

Recent findings indicate that calcium-channel blockers, which have been used for some time in the end-stage renal disease population, are primarily effective as antihypertensive and antianginal therapies. It has been recently noted that dialysis-related hypotension occurs less frequently in patients treated with calcium-channel blockers, and there is an improvement in access patency and overall patient survival with their use.

In summary, calcium-channel blockers are effective agents for controlling hypertension in end-stage renal disease patients and appear to favorably influence survival in this population. These agents are not dialyzable, and their pharmacokinetics do not substantially change with renal failure, thus they do not require dose adjustment based on the level of renal function. However, too few studies exist to determine if individual calcium-channel blockers differ in their effects. Prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trials are needed to better understand the role of calcium-channel blockers in the excess cardiovascular disease burden of the end-stage renal disease population.

### Verapamil hydrochloride [^111xhoU6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: Intravenous verapamil HCl has been used concomitantly with other cardioactive drugs, especially digitalis, without evidence of serious negative drug interactions. In rare instances, serious adverse effects have occurred when patients with severe cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, or recent myocardial infarction were given intravenous beta-adrenergic blocking agents or disopyramide concomitantly with intravenous verapamil. The concomitant use of verapamil hydrochloride with β-adrenergic blockers may result in an exaggerated hypotensive response, as observed in one study following the administration of verapamil and prazosin. It may be necessary to decrease the dose of verapamil and/or the dose of the neuromuscular blocking agent when these drugs are used together. Because verapamil is highly bound to plasma proteins, it should be administered cautiously to patients receiving other highly protein-bound drugs.

- **Other interactions**:
	- **Cimetidine**: The interaction between cimetidine and chronically administered verapamil has not been studied. In acute studies of healthy volunteers, the clearance of verapamil was either reduced or unchanged.
	- **Lithium**: Increased sensitivity to the effects of lithium (neurotoxicity) has been reported during concomitant verapamil-lithium therapy, with either no change or an increase in serum lithium levels. However, the addition of verapamil has also resulted in the lowering of serum lithium levels in patients receiving chronic stable oral lithium.

### Verapamil hydrochloride [^112XYVaR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Pregnancy:

- **Teratogenic effects**: Pregnancy Category C. Reproduction studies have been performed in rabbits and rats at oral verapamil doses up to 1.5 (15 mg/kg/day) and 6 (60 mg/kg/day) times the human oral daily dose, respectively, and have revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. In the rat, this multiple of the human dose was embryocidal and retarded fetal growth and development, probably because of adverse maternal effects reflected in reduced weight gains of the dams. This oral dose has also been shown to cause hypotension in rats. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

- **Labor and delivery**: There have been few controlled studies to determine whether the use of verapamil during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus, or whether it prolongs the duration of labor or increases the need for forceps delivery or other obstetric intervention. Such adverse experiences have not been reported in the literature, despite a long history of use of intravenous verapamil HCl in Europe in the treatment of cardiac side effects of beta-adrenergic agonist agents used to treat premature labor.

Nursing mothers:

Verapamil crosses the placental barrier and can be detected in umbilical vein blood at delivery. Additionally, verapamil is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants from verapamil, nursing should be discontinued while verapamil is administered.

### Using Mendelian randomization study to assess the renal effects of antihypertensive drugs [^111Wuqbw]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

From the perspective of clinical practice, our findings, together with previous RCTs, add support to guidelines recommending the use of ACE inhibitors or ACE inhibitor plus CCB in people with hypertension and kidney dysfunction. Our findings also suggest these reno-protective associations are generalizable to the general population. Genetic proxies for BBs were associated with lower eGFR; however, given the cardiovascular benefit of BBs, this concern should not outweigh its benefits, especially for patients with cardiovascular disease and without other renal comorbidities.

### What is a preferred angiotensin II receptor blocker-based combination therapy for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with diabetic and non-diabetic renal impairment [^115WstSF]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

A range of mostly two-drug antihypertensive SPCs is available. Preferred drug classes for combination regimens target the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), such as ARBs and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and diuretics. Selection depends on individual patient factors, including additional cardiovascular (CV) risk factors and comorbidities.

In patients with diabetes and high-normal blood pressure (BP) or overt hypertension, which together confer a greater risk of renal damage, combination therapy with a RAS blocker is preferred because these agents offer a superior protective effect against the initiation and progression of nephropathy. For patients with renal disease, antihypertensive therapy should aim to target a range of markers of renal (and CV) risk, such as serum creatinine, urine albumin:creatinine ratio, microalbuminuria, and proteinuria, usually through RAS blockade, with a view to reducing and slowing progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and CV events. Microalbuminuria, in particular, is a marker of global CV risk and is very common in patients with hypertension.

Several position statements also recommend combined therapy that includes RAS blockers. The American Society of Hypertension indicates a preference for RAS blockers in combination with either a diuretic or CCB, with SPCs rather than separate agents preferred when convenience outweighs all other considerations. Additionally, the International Society on Hypertension in Blacks (ISHB) recommends a RAS blocker-diuretic or CCB combination in patients with hypertension.

Regarding medical management for calcium channel blocker toxicity, specifically with respect to high-dose insulin, the 2017 guidelines from AAPCC/ACMT/CAEP/CAPCC/CCCS/CPS/EAPCCT/ESEM/ESICM/SCCM recommend considering the administration of incremental doses of high-dose insulin (up to 10 U/kg/hour) as rescue therapy. This is advised even if high-dose insulin has not been previously administered and in the absence of myocardial dysfunction in patients with CCB poisoning presenting with refractory shock or periarrest.

### Cyclosporin A tubular effects contribute to nephrotoxicity: Role for Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions [^112RLU94]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2003). Low credibility.

Cyclosporin A (CsA) nephrotoxicity has been attributed primarily to renal hemodynamic alterations caused by afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction. However, CsA nephropathy is also characterized by CsA-induced pre-glomerular disturbances and interstitial injury that may occur independently of hemodynamic changes. Given the high lipophilic activity of CsA, we hypothesized that direct tubular injury is likely to contribute to nephrotoxicity.

- **Methods**: To investigate the tubular toxicity of CsA, increasing concentrations of CsA (1, 2.5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 µg/ml) and its vehicle (cremophor) were added to isolated rat proximal tubules (PT). Cell injury was assessed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. The role of Ca²⁺ ions in tubular toxicity and the effect of calcium channel blockers on CsA toxicity were evaluated by measuring intracellular calcium using the fluorescent dye Fura-2 AM. The role of Mg²⁺ ions was assessed using a high extracellular Mg²⁺ medium (2 mM).

- **Results**: Whereas cremophor alone was not toxic to PT, CsA caused PT injury but only at the highest concentration (100 µg/ml). After 90 minutes of incubation, LDH was 22.5% in control PT and 41.9% in PT treated with 100 µg/ml CsA (P < 0.001, n = 11). There was a transient increase in intracellular calcium ([Ca²⁺]ᵢ) after CsA administration. A low calcium medium (100 nM) prevented CsA injury to renal tubules. However, verapamil, but not nifedipine, enhanced cell damage. Only nifedipine completely prevented [Ca²⁺]ᵢ increases following CsA. Finally, a high Mg(2+) medium attenuated CsA-induced injury.

Studies in female rats at daily dietary doses up to 5.5 times (55 mg/kg/day) the maximum recommended human dose did not show impaired fertility. Effects on male fertility have not been determined.

- **Pregnancy**: Pregnancy Category C. Reproduction studies have been performed in rabbits and rats at oral doses up to 1.5 (15 mg/kg/day) and 6 (60 mg/kg/day) times the human oral daily dose, respectively, and have revealed no evidence of teratogenicity.

### Drug-associated renal dysfunction and injury [^117Y69nr]. Nature Clinical Practice Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Renal dysfunction and injury secondary to medications are common and can present as subtle injury and/or overt renal failure. Some drugs disturb renal perfusion and induce a loss of filtration capacity. Others directly injure vascular, tubular, glomerular, and interstitial cells in such a way that specific loss of renal function leads to clinical findings, including microangiopathy, Fanconi syndrome, acute tubular necrosis, acute interstitial nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, obstruction, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, electrolyte abnormalities, and chronic renal failure. Understanding the mechanisms involved and recognizing the clinical presentations of renal dysfunction arising from the use of commonly prescribed medications are important if injury is to be detected early and prevented. This article reviews the clinical features and basic processes underlying renal injury related to the use of common drugs.

### Verelan [^117FDoE8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Verapamil administered concomitantly with oral antihypertensive agents such as vasodilators, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, and beta blockers will usually have an additive effect on lowering blood pressure. Patients receiving these combinations should be appropriately monitored. Concomitant use of agents that attenuate alpha-adrenergic function with verapamil may result in a reduction in blood pressure that is excessive in some patients. Such an effect was observed in one study following the concomitant administration of verapamil and prazosin.

- **Antiarrhythmic agents**:

	- **Disopyramide**: Until data on possible interactions between verapamil and disopyramide phosphate are obtained, disopyramide should not be administered within 48 hours before or 24 hours after verapamil administration.

	- **Flecainide**: A study in healthy volunteers showed that the concomitant administration of flecainide and verapamil may have additive effects on myocardial contractility, AV conduction, and repolarization. Concomitant therapy with flecainide and verapamil may result in an additive negative inotropic effect and prolongation of atrioventricular conduction.

	- **Quinidine**: In a small number of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (IHSS), concomitant use of verapamil and quinidine resulted in significant hypotension. Until further data are obtained, combined therapy of verapamil and quinidine in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy should probably be avoided. The electrophysiological effects of quinidine and verapamil on AV conduction were studied in eight patients.

### Calcium channel blockers for people with chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis [^116hSypE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are used to manage hypertension, which is highly prevalent among people with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The treatment for hypertension is particularly challenging in people undergoing dialysis.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of calcium channel blockers in patients with chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 27 April 2020 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Specialised Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared any type of CCB with other CCBs, different doses of the same CCB, other antihypertensives, control, or placebo were included. The minimum study duration was 12 weeks.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD), or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

- **Main results**: This review included 13 studies (24 reports) randomizing 1,459 participants treated with long-term hemodialysis. Nine studies were included in the meta-analysis (622 participants). No studies were performed in children or in those undergoing peritoneal dialysis.

### Initial single-pill blood pressure-lowering therapy: Should it be for most people [^113sYPvG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The importance of lowering blood pressure (BP) to reduce cardiovascular risk and progression of chronic kidney disease is well established. Furthermore, clinical trials that randomized various monotherapies to evaluate outcomes ultimately required an average of two or more medications to achieve BP goals. This was also true in trials involving elderly people.

### Pharmacology behind common drug nephrotoxicities [^115rd67s]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients are exposed to numerous prescribed and over-the-counter medications, which remain a relatively common cause of acute and chronic kidney injury. A combination of factors, including the innate nephrotoxicity of drugs, underlying patient characteristics that increase their risk for kidney injury, and the metabolism and pathway of excretion by the kidneys of the various agents administered, enhances the risk for drug-induced nephrotoxicity. This paper reviews these clinically relevant aspects of drug-induced nephrotoxicity for the clinical nephrologist.

### The role of calcium antagonists in chronic kidney disease [^114iftkn]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to examine the goals of antihypertensive treatment in chronic kidney disease, specifically focusing on the role that calcium antagonists play in reducing the progression of the disease.

Recent findings indicate that all newly published guidelines recommend a blood pressure target of less than 130/80 mmHg for patients with chronic kidney disease. However, the use of calcium antagonists is not recommended as part of the initial treatment approach. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), when used together with diuretics, effectively reduce blood pressure, proteinuria, and the rate of decline in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The effectiveness of calcium antagonists in these areas is more varied.

- **Dihydropyridine calcium antagonists**: Examples include amlodipine and felodipine, which help achieve blood pressure targets and reduce the risk of stroke. When used with a renin-angiotensin system blocker, they do not negate the beneficial effects of the blocker in slowing the progression of kidney disease.

- **Non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists**: Examples include verapamil and diltiazem. These decrease proteinuria and, in studies with five to six years of follow-up, preserve kidney function similarly to ACE inhibitors. The reason for the different outcomes between calcium antagonist subclasses is the partial preservation of renal autoregulation by non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, compared to the obliteration of this regulation by the dihydropyridine subclass.

In summary, the use of calcium antagonists is both safe and necessary to achieve blood pressure goals in individuals with chronic kidney disease. While both subclasses are effective in reaching these goals, dihydropyridine subclass antagonists particularly aid in maintaining renal function and overall blood pressure reduction.

### Verapamil hydrochloride [^1133KeJc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Treat all verapamil overdoses as serious and maintain observation for at least 48 hours, especially with Verapamil Hydrochloride Tablets SR, preferably under continuous hospital care. Delayed pharmacodynamic consequences may occur with the sustained-release formulation since verapamil is known to decrease gastrointestinal transit time.

Treatment of overdosage should be supportive. Beta-adrenergic stimulation or parenteral administration of calcium solutions may increase calcium ion flux across the slow channel and have been used effectively in the treatment of deliberate overdosage with verapamil. In a few reported cases, overdose with calcium channel blockers has been associated with hypotension and bradycardia. These conditions are initially refractory to atropine but become more responsive with the administration of large doses (close to 1 gram per hour for more than 24 hours) of calcium chloride.

Verapamil cannot be removed by hemodialysis. Clinically significant hypotensive reactions or high-degree AV block should be treated with vasopressor agents or cardiac pacing, respectively. Asystole should be handled by the usual measures, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

### Update on calcium antagonists and the kidney [^112G2Aap]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

The treatment of hypertension has been proven to reduce cardiovascular and renal risk. The role of long-acting calcium channel antagonists in the management of hypertension has been confused in the past due to a lack of controlled clinical trials involving people with hypertension, as well as subpopulations including those with diabetes and renal disease. In 2002, the results of the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial were published, marking the largest ever prospective drug-treatment trial. This trial involved 33,357 people with hypertension and included a calcium-antagonist group of 9,048 individuals. Major studies on blood pressure control in people with kidney disease include the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension, and publications related to people with diabetes include the results of the normotensive arm of the Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes trial.

- **Recent findings**: The main finding from the studies reported in the last year is that blood pressure control can be achieved using one or more of the first-line agents, including diuretics, calcium antagonists, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Based on the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial, diuretics make clinical and economic sense as initial therapy for those with hypertension. Calcium antagonists are well tolerated and effective and should be considered as the initial drug therapy when diuretics are not tolerated or when multiple drug therapy is indicated.

### Fda drug information for verapamil hydrochloride COER [^112wrkWX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of verapamil hydrochloride COER PO (also known as Covera-HS):

- **Increased serum ALP, increased serum transaminases, increased serum TBIL**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as verapamil hydrochloride COER is associated with a higher risk of these adverse events.

- **Myasthenia gravis**: Maintain a high level of suspicion in patients with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy. Verapamil prolongs recovery from the neuromuscular blocking agent vecuronium and worsens myasthenia gravis. It may be necessary to decrease the dosage of verapamil when administered to patients with attenuated neuromuscular transmission.

- **Pulmonary edema**: Use caution in patients with HCM or idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis.

### Multi-organ dysfunction as a presentation of calcium channel blocker intoxication [^112ydmnh]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB) which is commonly used in the management of essential hypertension and angina pectoris. It has a low metabolic clearance, unlike other CCBs, with the advantage of a once-daily dosage to maintain a near-constant plasma concentration.

CCBs are widely prescribed cardiovascular medications with potentially lethal adverse effects even at mild overdoses. The management of CCB overdose is mainly supportive, with various measures including gastrointestinal decontamination, fluid resuscitation, intravenous calcium, vasopressor agents, atropine, high-dose insulin euglycaemic therapy (HIET), and cardiac pacing.

Recently, intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) therapy has emerged as a promising measure in the management of CCB toxicity. ILE has been used previously in local anaesthetic toxicity, and recently, multiple case reports have been published using ILE as an antidote for a wide range of lipophilic xenobiotic poisonings. ILE used in CCB toxicity has demonstrated mixed results, showing some efficacy and a unique complication by preventing the use of renal replacement therapy.

We review the literature and discuss the need for further research into CCB intoxication and its fatal consequences.

### Verapamil hydrochloride [^115Vg4Wy]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Verapamil is an antihypertensive agent that, when administered concomitantly with oral antihypertensive agents such as vasodilators, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, and beta-blockers, usually yields an additive effect in lowering blood pressure. Patients on these combinations should be appropriately monitored. Notably, the concurrent use of agents that attenuate alpha-adrenergic function with verapamil may lead to an excessive reduction in blood pressure in some patients. Such an effect was observed in a study involving the concomitant administration of verapamil and prazosin.

- **Antiarrhythmic agents**:

	- **Disopyramide**: Until interactions between verapamil and disopyramide are fully understood, disopyramide should not be administered within 48 hours before or 24 hours after verapamil.

	- **Flecainide**: A study in healthy volunteers indicated that the concomitant use of flecainide and verapamil may have additive effects on myocardial contractility, AV conduction, and repolarization. This combination may result in an additive negative inotropic effect and prolongation of atrioventricular conduction.

	- **Quinidine**: In a few patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (IHSS), the combined use of verapamil and quinidine caused significant hypotension. Until further data is available, this combined therapy in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy should likely be avoided. The electrophysiologic effects of quinidine and verapamil on AV conduction were studied in eight patients.

### Cardiovascular and renal protection in type 2 diabetes mellitus: the role of calcium channel blockers [^114LY5iB]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2002). Low credibility.

The most important factor that prevents the progression of renal damage in diabetes mellitus, besides the improvement of blood glucose control, is tight blood pressure (BP) control. The tenet of tight BP control can be defined as achieving the lowest BP level possible using antihypertensive therapy, while avoiding untoward side effects. Both the Framingham Heart Study in nondiabetic normal subjects and the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study in type 2 diabetic patients have shown that systolic values as low as 108 to 111 mmHg and diastolic values as low as 70 to 71 mmHg are significantly associated with decreased cardiovascular mortality and morbidity.

However, 45 to 50% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension have systolic BP levels above 140 mmHg during antihypertensive therapy, particularly when using monotherapy. Thus, the choice of drugs to treat hypertension has become critical from a clinical perspective. Pharmaceutical compounds that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system have become the first-choice treatment in patients with diabetes mellitus and incipient and advanced renal complications.

This brief review analyzes the effects of calcium channel blockers (CCB) on cardiovascular and renal complications in diabetes mellitus. The review discusses studies that directly and blindly compared CCB with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and with angiotensin II AT(1) receptor blockers (ARB). Furthermore, the size of the population recruited in each trial was a consideration.

### Verapamil hydrochloride [^1161pVUz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Nitrates**: Verapamil has been administered alongside short- and long-acting nitrates without any undesirable drug interactions. The pharmacologic profile of both drugs and clinical experience suggest beneficial interactions.

- **Cimetidine**: The interaction between cimetidine and chronically administered verapamil has not been studied. Variable results on clearance have been obtained in acute studies of healthy volunteers; clearance of verapamil was either reduced or unchanged.

- **Lithium**: Increased sensitivity to the effects of lithium (neurotoxicity) has been reported during concomitant verapamil-lithium therapy; lithium levels have been observed to sometimes increase, sometimes decrease, and sometimes remain unchanged. Patients receiving both drugs must be monitored carefully.

- **Carbamazepine**: Verapamil therapy may increase carbamazepine concentrations during combined therapy. This may produce carbamazepine side effects such as diplopia, headache, ataxia, or dizziness.

- **Rifampin**: Therapy with rifampin may markedly reduce oral verapamil bioavailability.

- **Phenobarbital**: Phenobarbital therapy may increase verapamil clearance.

- **Cyclosporine**: Verapamil therapy may increase serum levels of cyclosporine.

- **Theophylline**: Verapamil may inhibit the clearance and increase the plasma levels of theophylline.

- **Inhalation anesthetics**: Animal experiments have shown that inhalation anesthetics depress cardiovascular activity by decreasing the inward movement of calcium ions. When used concomitantly, inhalation anesthetics and calcium antagonists, such as verapamil, should each be administered with caution to prevent adverse effects.

### Tiadylt ER [^116j5EQQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Diltiazem hydrochloride is extensively metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys and in bile. As with any drug given over prolonged periods, laboratory parameters of renal and hepatic function should be monitored at regular intervals. The drug should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. In subacute and chronic dog and rat studies designed to produce toxicity, high doses of diltiazem were associated with hepatic damage. In special subacute hepatic studies, oral doses of 125 mg/kg and higher in rats were associated with histological changes in the liver which were reversible when the drug was discontinued. In dogs, doses of 20 mg/kg were also associated with hepatic changes; however, these changes were reversible with continued dosing.

Dermatological events, including skin eruptions progressing to erythema multiforme and/or exfoliative dermatitis, have also been infrequently reported. Should a dermatologic reaction persist, the drug should be discontinued.

- **Drug interactions**: Due to the potential for additive effects, caution and careful titration are warranted in patients receiving diltiazem hydrochloride concomitantly with other agents known to affect cardiac contractility and/or conduction. Pharmacologic studies indicate that there may be additive effects in prolonging AV conduction when using beta-blockers or digitalis concomitantly with Tiadylt.

### Renal vulnerability to drug toxicity [^114DkfEo]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Drug-induced kidney disease occurs primarily in patients with underlying risk factors. A number of factors enhance the vulnerability of the kidney to the nephrotoxic effects of drugs and toxins. They are broadly categorized as patient-specific, kidney-related, and drug-related factors. One, two, or all three of these categories can act to promote various forms of renal injury. Importantly, all compartments of the kidney can be affected, resulting in one or more classic clinical renal syndromes, such as acute kidney injury, various tubulopathies, proteinuric renal disease, and chronic kidney disease. Recognizing risk factors that increase renal vulnerability to drug-induced kidney disease is the first step in reducing the renal complications of drugs and toxins.

### Verapamil hydrochloride [^111dgmyA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Verapamil hydrochloride is a calcium ion influx inhibitor (slow-channel blocker or calcium ion antagonist) that exerts its pharmacologic effects by modulating the influx of ionic calcium across the cell membrane of the arterial smooth muscle as well as in conductile and contractile myocardial cells.

- **Mechanism of action**: The precise mechanism of action of verapamil hydrochloride as an antianginal agent remains to be fully determined but includes the following two mechanisms:

	- **Relaxation and prevention of coronary artery spasm**: Verapamil hydrochloride dilates the main coronary arteries and coronary arterioles, both in normal and ischemic regions, and is a potent inhibitor of coronary artery spasm, whether spontaneous or ergonovine-induced. This property increases myocardial oxygen delivery in patients with coronary artery spasm and is responsible for the effectiveness of verapamil hydrochloride in vasospastic (Prinzmetal's or variant) as well as unstable angina at rest. Whether this effect plays any role in classical effort angina is not clear, but studies of exercise tolerance have not shown an increase in the maximum exercise rate-pressure product, a widely accepted measure of oxygen utilization. This suggests that, in general, relief of spasm or dilation of coronary arteries is not an important factor in classical angina.

	- **Reduction of oxygen utilization**: Verapamil hydrochloride regularly reduces the total peripheral resistance (afterload) against which the heart works both at rest and at a given level of exercise by dilating peripheral arteries.

### T/l-type calcium channel blocker reduces the composite ranking of relative risk according to new KDIGO guidelines in patients with chronic kidney disease [^111aiYi7]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) progressively increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in line with its severity. In 2002, the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) organization published a guideline providing diagnosis and classification of CKD into five stages according to severity, using the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as the main criterion. Recent studies have shown that individuals with a GFR ≤ 45 ml/min/1.73 m² are at increased risk compared with those with a higher GFR. The presence of proteinuria also significantly increases cardio-renal events. As a result, in 2009, the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) group recommended that individuals be classified according to proteinuria stage as well as GFR stage. The diagnostic criteria for CKD remained unchanged, but the new KDIGO guideline divided stage 3 (30 < GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m²) into the following two substages: 3a (GFR, 45 to < 60) and 3b (GFR, 30 to < 45). In addition, clinicians and researchers were advised to categorize patients using a "heat map" generated by the composite ranking of relative risk.

Renin-angiotensin system blockade with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II type-1 receptor blockers (ARBs) are respectively considered the most effective pharmacological approaches for renoprotection, reducing proteinuria more effectively than other antihypertensive drugs. Guidelines recommend blood pressure (BP) levels < 130/80 mmHg in patients with CKD. However, this reduction is difficult to achieve.

### Renoprotective effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists in experimental chronic renal failure [^114SFQAC]. American Journal of Nephrology (2001). Low credibility.

We compared the antihypertensive and renoprotective effects of the angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan and the calcium channel blocker verapamil in rats with chronic renal failure. One month after five-sixths nephrectomy, male WKY rats were treated for 2 months with either losartan or verapamil. Both treatments resulted in a similar reduction in blood pressure, from 147.1 to 112 mm Hg in losartan-treated rats and from 155 to 118 mm Hg in verapamil-treated rats (p = NS).

Losartan improved creatinine clearance, with a difference of +17.1% compared to +6.6% for verapamil (p = 0.039). It also prevented the increase in proteinuria, from 12.26 ± 2.33 mg/day before to 18.48 ± 2.19 mg/day after therapy in the losartan-treated group (p = NS), whereas in the verapamil-treated group, proteinuria increased from 17.27 ± 2.73 mg/day before to 32.27 ± 10.29 mg/day after therapy (p = 0.0484).

In addition, losartan resulted in minimal mesangial proliferation and significantly less glomerular sclerosis and less thickening of the small arterial and arteriolar walls. However, the changes in interstitial fibrosis and tubular hypertrophy were similar in both the verapamil- and losartan-treated groups.

Treatment with losartan one month after five-sixths nephrectomy in male WKY rats resulted in a reduction in blood pressure similar to that of the verapamil-treated group. Despite these similar antihypertensive properties, losartan improved creatinine clearance and reduced proteinuria. The losartan-treated group also demonstrated a marked reduction in mesangial proliferation, less glomerular sclerosis, and reduced vascular wall thickness in the kidneys.

### Using Mendelian randomization study to assess the renal effects of antihypertensive drugs [^111oHDPt]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a leading contributor to global years of life lost due to its role in cardiovascular disease. It is also a key risk factor for impaired kidney function, which might be affected by the kidney function itself. Different classes of antihypertensive drugs, acting via different targets, may exhibit varied renal effects. Most guidelines recommend the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as the first-line antihypertensive therapy for hypertension treatment in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

The European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines advocate combining an ACE inhibitor with a calcium channel blocker (CCB) as the first-line therapy in patients with proteinuria. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that treatment with ACE inhibitors can slow the decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and the progression to end-stage renal failure, independent of blood pressure reduction.

Network meta-analysis of RCTs comparing different antihypertensive classes suggests that the ACE inhibitor-CCB combination therapy is the most efficacious in reducing albuminuria in patients with diabetes and microalbuminuric kidney disease. However, whether these findings can be generalized to individuals without these comorbidities remains unclear. Given the limited number of often small-scale RCTs, the evidence may not be sufficient to support the use of ACE inhibitors as the first-line antihypertensive drug. Further evidence from large RCTs comprehensively comparing different classes of antihypertensives is needed to clarify these findings.
