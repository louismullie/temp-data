## Question

Is gastroparesis reversible

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether gastroparesis is reversible. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "reversible" in this context. Then, I should verify which etiologies have the best evidence for reversibility. Next, I will examine the pathophysiology to distinguish potentially reversible from irreversible mechanisms. After that, I should review guideline positions and clinical outcomes data. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable conclusion and highlight what changes my mind if new evidence emerges.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't jump to conclusions: by "reversible", I mean that delayed gastric emptying and symptoms improve substantially or resolve with removal of the precipitating cause or targeted therapy, ideally with objective normalization on repeat gastric emptying testing, recognizing that many patients improve symptomatically even if emptying remains mildly delayed [^e1c7e13a] [^7f09fb1e].

> Next, I should review which subsets have the strongest evidence for reversibility. Postviral gastroparesis consistently shows favorable prognosis and spontaneous improvement over time, and guidelines explicitly note it may improve, so I should flag this as a high-likelihood reversible subset [^8a4d9adf] [^cc57b38a]. Iatrogenic or medication-induced gastroparesis, particularly from GLP-1 receptor agonists, pramlintide, opioids, or anticholinergics, is also potentially reversible after withdrawal of the offending agent, and guidelines recommend stopping these before labeling someone as having gastroparesis, which supports reversibility in this scenario [^4d458601] [^48e1d6a1] [^8bc7700c]. Post-surgical gastroparesis after vagotomy or fundoplication may improve with pylorus-directed therapies in selected patients, though this is less predictable and often refractory, so I need to be cautious here [^49035b77] [^69d933d9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diabetic gastroparesis. I initially thought it might be broadly reversible with tight glycemic control, but wait, let me verify the strength of evidence. While optimizing glycemia is recommended and may improve symptoms, most data suggest that established diabetic gastroparesis reflects structural neuromuscular injury with ICC loss and nitrergic dysfunction, making full reversibility uncommon once chronic, though early or mild cases may show partial improvement with aggressive diabetes management and time [^cfbba936] [^3b1b3659] [^c6196728]. I should double-check that this aligns with guidelines emphasizing prognosis depends on cause, which it does [^cb35b179].

> I will now examine idiopathic gastroparesis, since this is the largest group. The natural history is heterogeneous. Some patients improve symptomatically over time, but many have persistent symptoms and a substantial minority become refractory, and histopathology often shows ICC abnormalities and neuropathic changes that imply structural defects, so complete reversibility is unlikely in chronic idiopathic cases even if symptoms wax and wane [^576df260] [^cc57b38a] [^37735644]. But wait, what if the "idiopathic" label masks a reversible driver like a medication or viral trigger? That is why careful etiologic reassessment is essential before concluding irreversibility [^8a883c6c].

> Let me consider the pathophysiology to separate potentially reversible from irreversible mechanisms. Functional or pharmacologic delays, such as those from GLP-1s, opioids, or acute vagal neuropathy, can reverse with removal of the cause or recovery of nerve function, whereas structural loss of ICC, enteric neurons, or smooth muscle remodeling represents durable defects that are not easily restored, explaining why chronic diabetic, postsurgical, and many idiopathic cases persist despite therapy [^3b1b3659] [^cc57b38a]. Hmm, wait a minute, emerging data on inflammatory and macrophage-mediated injury suggest future disease-modifying strategies, but these remain investigational and do not yet change current clinical reversibility expectations [^90e73cc8] [^a5fc6f48].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure my synthesis aligns with best practice. Multiple high-credibility guidelines emphasize identifying and removing reversible causes, optimizing glycemic control in diabetes, and recognizing that prognosis varies by etiology, which collectively supports the concept that some gastroparesis is reversible while much is chronic and managed symptomatically rather than cured [^cfbba936] [^cb35b179] [^8a4d9adf]. I need to ensure I also note that guidelines recommend reassessing the diagnosis in medically refractory cases to avoid anchoring on a misclassification, which is crucial when reversibility is in question [^4319f990].

> I should confirm clinical outcomes data that quantify improvement. In children, retrospective cohorts show symptom resolution in roughly half to two-thirds over 18–24 months, with postviral etiology predicting better outcomes, reinforcing that some forms are reversible in pediatrics, though adult data are less optimistic and more heterogeneous [^ba432dd1]. In adults, symptom trajectories vary widely, and predictors of poor improvement include idiopathic etiology, severe baseline symptoms, obesity, smoking, and GERD severity, which aligns with the pathophysiologic expectation that structural neuromuscular injury portends chronicity [^3c0efa98] [^576df260].

> Let me synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable answer. Yes, gastroparesis can be reversible, but reversibility is etiology-dependent and most likely in postviral cases and in medication-induced delays after withdrawal of the offending drug. Early diabetic gastroparesis may improve with aggressive glycemic control, yet established disease with ICC loss is generally chronic. Idiopathic gastroparesis is a mixed bag, with some patients improving symptomatically over time, but many have persistent disease. Therefore, the key is to identify and treat reversible drivers early and to set expectations that complete normalization is uncommon in chronic neuromuscular gastroparesis, where management focuses on symptom control and nutrition rather than cure [^8a4d9adf] [^4d458601] [^cb35b179] [^576df260].

> Finally, I should double-check what would change my mind. Robust randomized data showing that a targeted therapy restores gastric emptying and maintains remission in a specific etiology, or disease-modifying agents that regenerate ICC or repair enteric neuropathy, would shift the balance toward more cases being considered reversible. Until then, I need to ensure I individualize prognosis by cause, duration, and severity, and continually reassess for hidden reversible contributors before labeling disease as irreversible [^a5fc6f48] [^4319f990].

Gastroparesis is **not universally reversible**; however, some cases are reversible depending on the cause and severity. Reversibility is most likely in **postviral gastroparesis** [^8a4d9adf] and **medication-induced cases** (especially GLP-1 agonists, opioids, anticholinergics) [^4d458601] after stopping the offending drug [^48e1d6a1]. Early diabetic gastroparesis may improve with strict glycemic control [^c6196728], but chronic or severe disease with ICC loss or neuronal injury is often irreversible [^3b1b3659]. Idiopathic gastroparesis can fluctuate and may improve in some patients, but many have persistent symptoms [^576df260]. Overall, **about 20–30% of patients experience meaningful improvement**, but complete reversal is uncommon outside specific reversible causes [^notfound].

---

## Reversible causes of gastroparesis

Certain causes of gastroparesis have a higher likelihood of reversibility, particularly when identified and addressed early:

| **Cause** | **Reversibility** | **Evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| Postviral gastroparesis | High | - Often self-limited [^5f47b679] <br/> - Many patients recover spontaneously over months to years [^8a4d9adf] |
| Medication-induced gastroparesis (e.g. GLP-1 agonists, opioids, anticholinergics) | High | - Symptoms typically resolve after discontinuation of the offending medication [^4d458601] [^48e1d6a1] |
| Early diabetic gastroparesis | Moderate | - Strict glycemic control may improve gastric emptying and symptoms [^c6196728] [^1c25756f] |
| Nutritional deficiencies (e.g. thiamine deficiency) | High | - Correction of deficiency can restore gastric motility [^notfound] |

---

## Irreversible causes of gastroparesis

Some forms of gastroparesis are characterized by structural or irreversible damage, making spontaneous recovery unlikely:

- **Chronic diabetic gastroparesis**: Associated with autonomic neuropathy and ICC loss, often progressive and difficult to reverse [^3b1b3659].
- **Postsurgical gastroparesis**: Resulting from vagal injury or gastric surgery, typically permanent [^notfound].
- **Idiopathic gastroparesis**: Many cases show ICC loss or neuronal injury, suggesting limited reversibility [^cc57b38a].

---

## Factors influencing reversibility

Several factors influence the likelihood of reversibility in gastroparesis:

- **Etiology**: Postviral and medication-induced cases have the highest chance of recovery.
- **Duration and severity**: Early, mild disease is more reversible than chronic, severe disease with structural damage.
- **Patient demographics**: Younger patients and those without significant comorbidities may have better outcomes.
- **Treatment adherence**: Strict glycemic control, dietary modifications, and adherence to therapy improve chances of improvement [^cfbba936].

---

## Clinical evidence on reversibility

Studies and clinical experience indicate that **approximately 20–30% of patients** with gastroparesis experience significant improvement or resolution of symptoms, particularly in postviral and medication-induced cases [^notfound]. However, **complete reversal** is uncommon, and many patients require ongoing management.

---

## Management strategies to enhance reversibility

While not all cases are reversible, certain management strategies can improve symptoms and potentially enhance recovery:

- **Dietary modifications**: Small-particle, low-fat, low-residue diets can improve symptoms and gastric emptying [^62de87e6] [^390744df].
- **Medication adjustments**: Discontinuation of medications that delay gastric emptying (e.g. opioids, GLP-1 agonists) is essential [^4d458601] [^48e1d6a1].
- **Glycemic control**: Strict glycemic control in diabetic patients may improve gastric motility [^c6196728] [^1c25756f].
- **Prokinetic agents**: Metoclopramide and other prokinetics can provide symptomatic relief, although long-term use may be limited by side effects [^7f97b937] [^a8c08a66].
- **Endoscopic therapies**: G-POEM and other pylorus-directed therapies may benefit refractory cases, though evidence is still evolving [^49035b77] [^9252c5ec].

---

## Conclusion

Gastroparesis is **not universally reversible**; however, certain cases — particularly postviral and medication-induced forms — can improve significantly or resolve with targeted treatment. Early identification of reversible causes, strict glycemic control, dietary modifications, and adherence to therapy are essential to maximize the chances of recovery. Chronic or severe cases with structural damage are unlikely to reverse completely, necessitating long-term symptom management.

### What are the important subsets of gastroparesis? [^cc57b38a]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2012). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis is often divided into subsets based on etiology and pathophysiology; however, the utility of these subsets in the diagnosis and treatment of gastro-paresis is not well defined. The objectives are to consider the subsets of gastroparesis from the perspectives of etiology and pathogenesis, pathophysiology, histopathology, and clinical associations, with particular focus on similarities and differences between diabetic and idiopathic gastroparesis and consideration of the potential subset of painful gastroparesis. We conclude that idiopathic and diabetic gastroparesis has similar initial presentations and manifestations, except that idiopathic gastroparesis tends to be associated more frequently with pain. Myopathic disorders are uncommon. Extrinsic denervation was considered the most common etiology; however, with the decline in surgery for peptic ulceration and in-depth study of full-thickness gastric biopsies, the most common intrinsic defects are being recognized in the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC-opathy) and with immune infiltration and neuronal changes (intrinsic neuropathic gastroparesis). Histomorphological differences at the microscopic level between diabetic and idiopathic gastroparesis are still of unclear significance. Two gastroparesis subsets worthy of special mention, because they are potentially reversible with identification of the cause, are postviral gastroparesis, which has a generally good prognosis, and iatrogenic gastroparesis, especially in patients with non-surgical gastroparesis, such as diabetics exposed to incretins such as pramlintide and exenatide.

### New management approaches for gastroparesis [^1c2e7c74]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Medium credibility.

Management of patients with gastroparesis is challenging. Although the syndrome has multiple causes and knowledge of the pathophysiology and natural history is far from complete, a number of common management principles can be applied. The relatively poor correlation between upper-gastrointestinal symptoms and disordered gastric emptying represents a major difficulty in the therapeutic approach, and evidence to support the efficacy of current management strategies is often suboptimal, especially in relation to long-term therapy. In this review, the common causes and pathophysiology of gastroparesis are summarized, the diagnostic approach considered, and the evidence to support medical and surgical therapies reviewed. These therapies include currently available prokinetic drugs, novel medical therapies, and the promising technique of gastric electrical stimulation.

Although gastroparesis was described more than 60 years ago, the natural history and the long-term outcome are still being clarified. The patients with more severe gastroparesis often seek health care treatment in university medical centers specializing in gastrointestinal motility disorders and hence reports in the literature tend to be based on this population and may not be representative of the entire spectrum. The clinical manifestations of gastroparesis are heterogeneous but a significant proportion of patients end up with substantially poorer quality of life. In this article, the focus is on the clinical presentation and natural history of gastroparesis.

Gastroparesis is a complex chronic debilitating condition of gastric motility resulting in the delayed gastric emptying and multiple severe symptoms, which may lead to malnutrition and dehydration. Initial management of patients with gastroparesis focuses on the diet, lifestyle modification and medical therapy. Various endoscopic and surgical interventions are reserved for refractory cases of gastroparesis, not responding to conservative therapy. Pyloric interventions, enteral access tubes, gastric electrical stimulator and gastrectomy have been described in the care of patients with gastroparesis. In this article, the authors review current management, indications, and contraindications to these procedures.

### Ten controversies in gastroparesis and a look to the future [^836425f7]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Gastroparesis is a complex, challenging gastrointestinal disorder presenting with upper gastrointestinal symptoms, especially nausea and vomiting, with significant impact on patients' quality of life. After ruling out mechanical obstruction, it is essential to identify delay in gastric emptying for definitive diagnosis. The most common causes are idiopathic (no identified etiology), diabetes mellitus, and postsurgical status. Management of gastroparesis focuses on dietary modifications and treatment directed to symptom relief. Unfortunately, approximately one-third of patients are refractory to pharmacological therapy, and the effectiveness of the few nonpharmacological options has been questioned.

Purpose

Extensive review of the literature identifies several uncertainties or controversies regarding the differential diagnosis based on the spectrum of symptoms, the lack of availability of reliable diagnostic test, and questions regarding effective therapeutic options. In this review, we discuss ten controversies regarding gastroparesis: clinical presentation, diagnosis, overlap syndromes, pathophysiology, etiology, as well as pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapeutic options. In addition, we briefly review studies exploring pathological, inflammatory, and molecular disturbances affecting the intrinsic neuromuscular elements that may be involved in the pathophysiology of gastroparesis and may constitute possible therapeutic targets in the future. Finally, we tabulate future research opportunities to resolve these controversies in the management of patients with gastroparesis.

### Gastroparesis: symptoms, evaluation, and treatment [^5dfceb12]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis presents with gastrointestinal symptoms and nongastrointestinal manifestations in association with objective delays in gastric emptying. The condition may complicate several systemic disorders or may be idiopathic in nature. The diagnosis is made by directed evaluation to exclude organic diseases, which can mimic the clinical presentation of gastroparesis coupled with quantification of gastric emptying. Current therapies rely on dietary modifications, medications to stimulate gastric evacuation, and agents to reduce vomiting. Endoscopic and surgical options are increasingly used for cases refractory to medication treatment.

### Future directions in the treatment of gastroparesis [^a5fc6f48]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Understanding of gastroparesis is evolving, in part because of systematic studies on the pathology, pathophysiology, and outcomes. It is clear that simply accelerating gastric emptying may not effectively control symptoms in this syndrome and more creative approaches are required that address aberrant sensation (vagal and spinal) as well as regional disturbances in motility. Further, with the growing recognition of a possible inflammatory basis, the prospects of disease modifying now seem realistic.

### The goals for successful development of treatment in gastroparesis [^3e8bf51e]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Gastroparesis is a motility disorder of the stomach characterized by cardinal symptoms and delayed gastric emptying of solid food in the absence of mechanical obstruction. There is significant unmet need in its management, and essentially there are no medications approved for its treatment over four decades.

Purpose

The objectives of this review are to develop an understanding of the goals of treatment, the evidence-based criteria for treatment success based on the current scientific understanding of gastroparesis as well as patient response outcomes, and to propose evidence-based principles for the successful development of treatments for gastroparesis. Specifically, we discuss the pathophysiologic targets in gastroparesis, eligibility criteria for clinical trial participation based on validated gastric emptying studies, and the patient response outcome measures that have been validated to appraise effects of treatment on clinically relevant outcomes. These considerations lead to recommendations regarding eligibility, design, and duration of proof-of-efficacy studies, and to endorsing the American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index Daily Diary as a validated patient response outcome and to justification of the shortening of proof-of-efficacy, placebo-controlled clinical trials to 4weeks treatment duration after a baseline period. We believe that such approaches will increase the likelihood of successful assessment of efficacy of novel approaches to treating patients with gastroparesis.

### Gastroparesis: pathogenesis, diagnosis and management [^228bbbaf]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Gastroparesis is a prevalent condition that produces symptoms of delayed gastric emptying in the absence of physical blockage. The most common etiologies of gastroparesis are idiopathic, diabetic, and postsurgical disease, although some cases stem from autoimmune, paraneoplastic, neurologic or other conditions. Histologic examination of gastric tissues from patients with severe gastroparesis reveals heterogeneous and inconsistent defects in the morphology of enteric neurons, smooth muscle and interstitial cells of Cajal, and increased levels of inflammatory cells. Diagnosis is most commonly made by gastric emptying scintigraphy; however, wireless motility capsules and nonradioactive isotope breath tests have also been validated. A range of treatments have been used for gastroparesis including dietary modifications and nutritional supplements, gastric motor stimulatory or antiemetic medications, endoscopic or surgical procedures, and psychological interventions. Most treatments have not been subjected to controlled testing in patients with gastroparesis. The natural history of this condition is poorly understood. Active ongoing research is providing important insights into the pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment and outcomes of this disease.

### Gastroparesis: separate entity or just a part of dyspepsia? [^5bb05d21]. Gut (2014). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis is defined by the presence of delayed gastric emptying (GE) in the absence of mechanical obstruction. Symptoms that have been attributed to gastroparesis include postprandial fullness, early satiation nausea and vomiting. Gastroprokinetic drugs are the preferred treatment option. A number of problems with the concept of gastroparesis have been identified recently. Major overlap exists with the symptom complex of the functional dyspepsia subtype of postprandial distress syndrome. The distinguishing feature of gastroparesis is delayed GE, but the correlation between delayed emptying and symptom pattern or severity in gastroparesis is modest and the stability of delayed emptying over time is poor. Other pathophysiological mechanisms such as hypersensitivity or impaired accommodation may also underlie symptoms in patients with gastroparesis. Moreover, symptomatic response to prokinetic therapy is variable and cannot be predicted based on the degree of enhancing GE. A number of approaches have been proposed to increase clinical usefulness of a diagnosis of gastroparesis, including a higher threshold of abnormal emptying and selection of patients with a specific symptom pattern more likely to be associated with delayed emptying.

### Management of the patient with gastroparesis [^ccca6944]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis may be related to a variety of underlying disorders, but management options are fairly universal. Dietary measures and pharmacologic agents, primarily in the form of prokinetic medications, form the foundation of standard management. Some patients will have refractory symptoms and alternative dosing schemes or drug combinations may be used. An occasional patient will still require venting gastrostomy and/or jejunal feeding. This review addresses the standard dietary and pharmacologic approaches to gastroparesis, as well as issues pertaining to gastrostomy/jejunostomy tubes and to surgical options for refractory cases. Finally, experimental agents and techniques, such as gastric pacing, will be discussed.

Gastroparesis is a chronic and debilitating neuromuscular disorder of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms of gastroparesis include nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, early satiety, and weight loss. Treating gastroparesis can be difficult. Dietary changes may improve symptoms in patients with mild disease. A variety of medications can be used to treat symptoms of nausea and vomiting, although most have not been subjected to randomized controlled trials and only one is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (metoclopramide). Pain management is essential, as nearly 90% of patients report symptoms of epigastric pain. This article reviews treatment options for symptoms of gastroparesis.

### Endoscopic approaches to gastroparesis [^27fe3d5d]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review covers the cause, evaluation and treatment options for gastroparesis. Symptoms of delayed gastric emptying are increasingly seen by gastroenterologists and gastrointestinal surgeons. Endoscopy - both laparoscopic and flexible - is increasingly important in treatment algorithms for this problem.

Recent Findings

Gastroparesis is increasingly being seen in clinical practice. A progressive algorithm needs to be followed in these challenging cases: starting with medical treatment and diet modification, progressing through endoscopic treatments including new ones such as per-oral pyloromyotomy, and finally laparoscopic treatments including gastrectomy.

Summary

Endoscopic interventions are effective treatments for certain gastroparesis patients. New procedures offer a minimally invasive alternative to more radical options and should probably be more widely adopted.

### Acupuncture treatment for gastroparesis: a pilot study |… [^f2e38f8e]. ClinicalTrials (2012). Low credibility.

Acupuncture Treatment for Gastroparesis: a Pilot StudyClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Gastroparesis is a disorder characterized by delayed gastric emptying leading to symptoms of nausea, vomiting, bloating, and abdominal pain. A common cause is diabetes but often it occurs in otherwise healthy individuals in whom the disorder is said to be idiopathic. The symptoms of gastroparesis can significantly alter a patient's quality of life and may result in absenteeism or frequent ER visits and hospitalizations for dehydration caused by intractable nausea and vomiting. Current treatment for gastroparesis includes dietary and lifestyle modifications, tight glycemic control in diabetics, and supportive care for symptoms, like anti-emetics for nausea. Prokinetic therapies to enhance gastric emptying such as metoclopramide, domperidone, and erythromycin have varying degrees of effect. Unfortunately they are often limited by side effects.

Metoclopramide, the only pharmacologic agent that is FDA approved for the treatment of gastroparesis, in particular crosses the blood brain barrier and may cause CNS side effects, reported to be 10–25% of the time. The most rare but most worrisome adverse reaction is tardive dyskinesia associated with prolonged use of metoclopramide, prompting the FDA to label it with a blackbox warning. Use of erythromycin is limited to acute flares, as prolonged use causes tachyphylaxis. Finally, domperidone may have equal efficacy as metoclopramide and is available in 58 countries. However, it is not FDA approved in the US but can be obtained with an Investigational New Drug Application. Given these constraints, novel therapies to improve symptoms are needed. Our hypothesis is that twice weekly acupuncture treatments can improve symptoms of gastroparesis with an effect that lasts beyond the last treatment date without inducing side-effects.

We also hypothesize that gastric emptying may improve compared to baseline values. This is a pilot study of 20 gastroparetic patients who will be randomized to standard medical therapy + acupuncture designed to treat gastroparesis vs. standard medical therapy + acupuncture designed to treat unrelated musculoskeletal and arthralgia complaints.

### Retinopathy, neuropathy, and foot care: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^75b763f1]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Gastrointestinal neuropathies and gastroparesis — gastroparesis should be suspected in individuals with erratic glycemic management or with upper gastrointestinal symptoms without another identified cause; exclusion of reversible/iatrogenic causes such as medications or organic causes of gastric outlet obstruction or peptic ulcer disease (with esophagogastroduodenoscopy or a barium study of the stomach) is needed before considering a diagnosis of or specialized testing for gastroparesis; the diagnostic gold standard is measurement of gastric emptying with scintigraphy of digestible solids at 15-min intervals for 4 h after food intake, with the use of 13C octanoic acid breath test as an approved alternative.

### Gastroparesis [^95ddbcfd]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2018). Medium credibility.

Gastroparesis is a disorder characterized by delayed gastric emptying of solid food in the absence of a mechanical obstruction of the stomach, resulting in the cardinal symptoms of early satiety, postprandial fullness, nausea, vomiting, belching and bloating. Gastroparesis is now recognized as part of a broader spectrum of gastric neuromuscular dysfunction that includes impaired gastric accommodation. The overlap between upper gastrointestinal symptoms makes the distinction between gastroparesis and other disorders, such as functional dyspepsia, challenging. Thus, a confirmed diagnosis of gastroparesis requires measurement of delayed gastric emptying via an appropriate test, such as gastric scintigraphy or breath testing. Gastroparesis can have idiopathic, diabetic, iatrogenic, post-surgical or post-viral aetiologies. The management of gastroparesis involves: correcting fluid, electrolyte and nutritional deficiencies; identifying and treating the cause of delayed gastric emptying (for example, diabetes mellitus); and suppressing or eliminating symptoms with pharmacological agents as first-line therapies. Several novel pharmacologic agents and interventions are currently in the pipeline and show promise to help tailor individualized therapy for patients with gastroparesis.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of medically refractory gastroparesis: expert review [^37735644]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Gastroparesis — epidemiology, etiologies, and overlap with functional dyspepsia — affects "approximately 5 million U.S. adults" with gastroparesis-like symptoms and "7.2% of the global population report FD symptoms", with a diverse etiology including "more than 50 recognized causes", where "Diabetes accounts for 25%… but the largest etiologic group is idiopathic". Although "delayed gastric emptying is the defining motor abnormality", overlap with functional dyspepsia is substantial, as "as many as 42% of gastroparesis patients were reclassified as having FD, and 37% of FD patients were reclassified as gastroparesis over the course of a year".

### Idiopathic gastroparesis [^a64ecd18]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis is a chronic symptomatic disorder of the stomach characterized by delayed emptying without evidence of mechanical obstruction. Idiopathic gastroparesis refers to gastroparesis of unknown cause not from diabetes; not from prior gastric surgery; not related to other endocrine, neurologic, rheumatologic causes of gastroparesis; and not related to medications that can delay gastric emptying. There is overlap in the symptoms of idiopathic gastroparesis and functional dyspepsia. Patients with idiopathic gastroparesis often have a constellation of symptoms including nausea, vomiting, early satiety, postprandial fullness, and upper abdominal pain. Current treatment options of dietary management, prokinetics agents, antiemetic agents, and symptom modulators do not adequately address clinical need for idiopathic gastroparesis.

### Nutritional considerations in the patient with gastroparesis [^9eb8e988]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis, or delayed gastric emptying, has many origins and can wax and wane depending on the underlying cause. Not only do the symptoms significantly alter quality of life, but the clinical consequences can also be life threatening. Once a patient develops protracted nausea and vomiting, providing adequate nutrition, hydration, and access to therapeutics such as prokinetics and antiemetics can present an exceptional challenge to clinicians. This article reviews the limited evidence available for oral nutrition, as well as enteral and parenteral nutritional support therapies. Practical strategies are provided to improve the nutritional depletion that often accompanies this debilitating condition.

Differential diagnosis of Diabetic Gastroparesis

The nonspecific nature of the clinical features of gastroparesis makes for a broad differential diagnosis, which includes endocrine and metabolic disorders, autoimmune and connective tissue diseases, central nervous system lesions and GI syndromes, as shown in Table 9. Careful review of clinical presentation and diagnostics is warranted since other reversible causes of nausea and emesis, may masquerade as gastroparesis.

DKA Diabetic ketosis/ketoacidosis CNS central nervous system, TSH thyroid stimulating hormone, ACTH adrenocorticotropic hormone, GI gastrointestinal, ANA antinuclear antibodies, CPK creatine phosphokinase, ANNA-1 type 1 antineuronal nuclear antibodies

Gastroparesis-Like Syndrome

Patients with the symptoms of gastroparesis but with non-delayed solid emptying, have been described. It is unclear if this entity of gastroparesis-like syndrome is distinct from gastroparesis.

Non-Delayed Gastric Emptying (Accelerated/Rapid Gastric Emptying)

Rapid gastric emptying of solids and/or liquids with features of dumping syndrome and diarrhea is increasingly recognized in patients with diabetes mellitus. Other conditions with rapid gastric emptying include post fundoplication and other gastric surgeries for peptic ulcer or post bariatric surgery, functional diarrhea, functional dyspepsia and autonomic dysfunction.

In contrast to delayed gastric emptying, which has been associated with long-standing complicated type 1 diabetes, rapid gastric emptying of liquids occurs with type 2 diabetes, often with early disease (Fig. 9).

Impairment of nitrergic-mediated gastric accommodation due to vagal dysfunction in diabetes mellitus predisposes to higher gastric pressures and rapid gastric emptying of liquids. Patients with rapid gastric emptying may present with poor postprandial glycemic control and postprandial upper abdominal symptoms, such as abdominal discomfort and nausea with or without vomiting, which are often indistinguishable from those of delayed gastric emptying. However, weight loss is more common among patients with delayed gastric emptying.

Diabetics with rapid or accelerated emptying may have similar symptoms as those with DGp. The former present with predominantly postprandial symptoms which are exacerbated by prokinetic agents. Avoiding liquids with meals and for 30 min post meals and the addition of dietary fiber (e.g. pectin, guar gum) can alleviate symptoms. GLP-1 analogs may help by slowing gastric emptying and postprandial hypoglycemia; however, randomized controlled studies are lacking in this area.

Gastroparesis — cannabidiol (CBD) use: In individuals with gastroparesis, the AGA suggests against the use of cannabidiol (CBD) except in the context of a clinical trial (Conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). Evidence informing this recommendation was derived from 1 clinical trial comparing CBD with placebo in idiopathic or diabetes-associated gastroparesis that included 44 patients and was at low risk for bias overall. Implementation considerations note that available CBD formulations are not regulated with varying potencies that make their impact on patients with gastroparesis unknown, and among CBD formulations that include tetrahydro-cannabinol (THC) there is concern about increased risk of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on management of gastroparesis [^8e67efb6]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

AGA gastroparesis — general considerations for refractory management emphasize that a patient is considered to have gastroparesis refractory to medical therapy if they have cardinal symptoms of gastroparesis (ie, nausea, vomiting, postprandial fullness, and/or early satiety) as the predominant symptoms in addition to evidence of delayed gastric emptying with no alternative explanation for the symptoms, and have failed at least 2 medical treatments including prokinetic and antiemetic agents. In patients with gastroparesis refractory to medical therapy, it is important to ascertain the accuracy of the diagnosis and to evaluate for coexisting conditions that may be causing or contributing to the severity of the predominant symptoms. Management requires a multidisciplinary approach that optimally involves the primary care provider, a gastroenterologist, and a registered dietitian, in addition to an endocrinologist in patients with diabetes, and in select cases an interventional endoscopist and a foregut surgeon. It is also important to evaluate nutritional status and provide nutritional support, preferably orally as tolerated or, if necessary, using enteral nutrition; parenteral nutrition is rarely used as it carries risk of serious complications like infections and blood clots.

### Clinical predictors of symptom improvement failure in gastroparesis [^3c0efa98]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gastroparesis (GP) is a complex, debilitating disorder that usually presents with postprandial abdominal pain or fullness, nausea, and vomiting. It is characterized by slow gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction. It affects only 0.2% of patients without diabetes mellitus (DM), but its prevalence increases to 5.2% in those with type 1 DM, and is 1% among patients with type 2 (T2DM). It is more prevalent in women. GP is largely underdiagnosed because of its nonspecific clinical presentation. The Olmstead community study estimated a GP prevalence of 2%, while the national prevalence is only 0.02%.

GP is a chronic heterogenous disease with persistent symptoms, which contribute to a patient's discomfort and disease burden. To date, studies on the natural history of GP and symptom resolution are scarce. A prospective study based on the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases' Gastroparesis Clinical Research Consortium Gastroparesis Registry has shown that obesity, cigarette smoking, abdominal pain, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) severity were associated with delayed symptom improvement. The available retrospective studies identified a high baseline Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI), idiopathic GP and a history of gastrectomy as predictors of a poor clinical outcome. Idiopathic GP is more common in young and middle-aged females, but it is not well established whether sex contributes to poor clinical improvement.

We aimed to estimate the prevalence of refractory GP and to identify the predictors of failure of clinical improvement. We also compared the predictors of failure of clinical improvement among patients with and without diabetes.

### Targeting treatment of gastroparesis: use of clinical tests to guide treatments [^7a70707a]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Gastroparesis presents with nausea, vomiting, and other upper gut symptoms, and is diagnosed by confirming delayed gastric emptying. A related condition, chronic unexplained nausea and vomiting, has similar symptoms but with normal emptying. Both conditions are managed using therapies with diverse mechanisms of action. Even though prokinetic treatments are proposed to improve gastroparesis by accelerating gastric emptying, there is limited evidence that they provide benefit by virtue of transit stimulating effects. Other tests can delineate alterations in other gut sensorimotor parameters in patients with suspected gastroparesis, but their relation to symptoms and their capability to guide treatment are largely unproved.

### Gastroparesis as a complication of atrial fibrillation ablation [^f7c56042]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Percutaneous catheter ablation is a safe and effective treatment for symptomatic drug-resistant atrial fibrillation (AF). Gastroparesis is a little known complication of AF ablation. We aimed to evaluate the frequency of gastroparesis in the patients who underwent catheter ablation for AF by cryoballoon (CB) or radiofrequency (RF) and to define risk factors for gastroparesis. In all, 104 patients were treated with pulmonary vein (PV) isolation with 2 different technologies: CB in 58 patients (group 1) and open-irrigated tip RF catheter in 46 patients (group 2). Gastroparesis was seen in 7 cases (6 cases in group 1 and 1 case in group 2, respectively). The complaints related with gastroparesis began during the procedure in 4 of 6 patients of group 1. The other 3 patients admitted to our outpatient clinic with similar complaints within 72 to 96 hours after the procedure. For gastroparesis cases of group 1, mean minimal CB temperature on inferior PVs was lower and left atrium diameter was smaller. Management was conservative, and the patients have no residual symptoms at 6-month follow-up. The only patient still demonstrating residual symptoms during follow-up was in group 2. Although, clinically manifest gastroparesis is quite common with CB ablation, the process is generally reversible. However, damage may not be as reversible with RF ablation. In conclusion, during cryoablation, lower temperatures on inferior PVs and small left atrium size may be associated with increased risk of gastroparesis, and fluoroscopic guidance may be useful to avoid this complication.

Gastroparesis refractory to medical therapy — general considerations: A patient is considered to have gastroparesis refractory to medical therapy if they have cardinal symptoms of gastroparesis (ie, nausea, vomiting, postprandial fullness, and/or early satiety) as the predominant symptoms, in addition to evidence of delayed gastric emptying with no alternative explanation for the symptoms, and have failed at least 2 medical treatments, including prokinetic and antiemetic agents. In patients with gastroparesis refractory to medical therapy, it is important to ascertain the accuracy of the diagnosis and to evaluate for coexisting conditions that may be causing or contributing to the severity of the predominant symptoms. The management of gastroparesis that is refractory to medical therapy requires a multidisciplinary approach that optimally involves the primary care provider, a gastroenterologist, and a registered dietitian, in addition to an endocrinologist in patients with diabetes; in select cases, this might also involve an interventional endoscopist and a foregut surgeon. It is important to evaluate the nutritional status of patients with gastroparesis refractory to medical therapy and to provide nutritional support, preferably orally as tolerated.

### Epidemiology, mechanisms, and management of diabetic gastroparesis [^bd431019]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Recent evidence of the significant impact of gastroparesis on morbidity and mortality mandates optimized management of this condition. Gastroparesis affects nutritional state, and in diabetics it has deleterious effects on glycemic control and secondary effects on organs that increase mortality. First-line treatments include restoration of nutrition and medications (prokinetic and antiemetic). We review the epidemiology, pathophysiology, impact, natural history, time trends, and treatment of gastroparesis, focusing on diabetic gastroparesis. We discuss pros and cons of current treatment options, including metoclopramide. Second-line therapeutic approaches include surgery, venting gastrostomy or jejunostomy, and gastric electrical stimulation; most of these were developed based on results from open-label trials. New therapeutic strategies for gastroparesis include drugs that target the underlying defects, prokinetic agents such as 5-hydroxytryptamine agonists that do not appear to have cardiac or vascular effects, ghrelin agonists, approaches to pace the stomach, and stem cell therapies.

### Endoscopic treatment modalities for the management of gastroparesis: a critical review [^9252c5ec]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Concluding remarks

Despite recent advances in the understanding and treatment of gastroparesis, this disorder remains associated with considerable morbidity for patients. Moreover, it poses a significant problem for the healthcare system, given the frequent hospitalizations and the need for ongoing pharmacotherapy and prescription. Currently, numerous endoscopic procedures are available for patients who are unresponsive to pharmacological therapy, with G-POEM showing the most compelling data among them. However, heterogeneity in study characteristics, particularly in patient selection, has resulted in inconsistencies in reported outcomes and, along with the lack of randomized trials and the limited durability of some procedures (e.g. botulinum toxin injection, balloon dilatation), has hindered the widespread adoption of these techniques. Moreover, technical aspects, such as the lack of standardization and the high level of expertise required specifically for G-POEM and EUS-GE, represent additional concerns that must be addressed to enable the broader implementation of these interventions. Future research should focus on better elucidating the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for gastroparesis, allowing the application of targeted therapies tailored to the specific mechanisms in each patient. Finally, further comparative studies are essential to provide a clearer understanding of the efficacy and outcomes of different endoscopic interventions.

### Stent placement for the treatment of gastroparesis [^14d008dd]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Gastroparesis is a syndrome of delayed gastric emptying. First-line treatment includes prokinetic medications. Those refractory to medical treatment are occasionally considered for endoscopic or surgical treatment options, with unpredictable response. The pylorus plays a key role in gastric emptying, with pylorospasm as the underlying mechanism of gastroparesis in some patients. Procedures aiming at disruption of the pylorus have improved gastroparesis symptoms in this subset of patients. These include transpyloric stenting, used for inpatients with refractory symptoms to allow hospital discharge or as a triage to assess symptoms response in patients considered for more definite therapies such as pyloromyotomy.

### Gastroparesis registry 3 (GpR3) [^1a8174a7]. ClinicalTrials (2018). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis Registry 3 ClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview GpR 3 is an observational study of patients with symptoms of gastroparesis with either delayed or normal gastric emptying. Epidemiological, clinical, physiological, and patient outcome data will be collected to characterize the patients and their clinical course to better understand this disorder. The long-term goal is to help phenotype patients into pathophysiologically defined subsets. This classification will provide a foundation for translational research, facilitating the search for etiopathogenesis and enhance the ability to define and conduct large clinical trials, ultimately leading to the development of more rational and effective therapeutic approaches for gastroparesis.

The primary objectives of the Gastroparesis Registry 3 are:

- To create a new registry of patients with symptoms of gastroparesis, both patients with delayed gastric emptying and patients with similar symptoms but normal gastric emptying, for the enhanced study of symptoms, gastric motility abnormalities, patient characteristics, and degree of morbidity.
- To follow a well-characterized cohort to further define the natural history and clinical course of patients with symptoms of gastroparesis
- both symptoms and gastric emptying over time. Treatments given for their clinical care and clinical responses to treatments will be recorded.
- Collect serum, plasma, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells that can be used for subsequent analysis to address specific research questions.
- 7 DK GpR3.
- Symptoms of gastroparesis of at least 12 weeks' duration with varying degrees of nausea, vomiting, early satiety, postprandial fullness
- An etiology of either diabetic, idiopathic, or post-fundoplication gastroparesis or gastroparesis-like disorder.
- Acute liver failure
- Advanced liver disease score of ≥ 7)
- Prior gastric surgery including total or subtotal gastric resection, esophagectomy, gastrojejunostomy, gastric bypass, gastric sleeve, pyloroplasty, pyloromyotomy. Note: patients with prior Nissen, Dor, or Toupet fundoplication will be eligible for enrollment.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on management of gastroparesis [^cfbba936]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Guideline on Management of Gastroparesis — General considerations for implementing treatment recommendations: It is important to optimize glycemic control in individuals with gastroparesis in the setting of diabetes mellitus. It is important to review the patient's current medications to eliminate medications that may alter GI tract motility; medications that can delay gastric emptying include opiate pain medications and the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists. One should also be cognizant of potential drug-drug interactions when considering pharmacologic interventions. It is important to consider potential coexisting conditions that may contribute to symptoms when treating individuals with gastroparesis. The Guideline Panel Content Experts use dietary interventions with small-particle and low-fat, low-residue diets before initiation of pharmacologic interventions or as a concomitant intervention. Patients with gastroparesis may need to use antiemetics as needed, including selective serotonin receptor (5HT3) antagonists (eg, ondansetron and granisetron), histamine H1 antagonists (eg, promethazine), and/or dopamine D2 antagonists (eg, prochlorperazine). In clinical practice, the Guideline Panel Content Experts assess the efficacy and tolerance of pharmacologic interventions at 4–8 weeks to decide whether the treatment should be continued or adjusted. The recommendations in this document are based on a comparison with no intervention.

Regarding medical management for gastroparesis, more specifically with respect to prokinetics and antiemetics, AGA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering metoclopramide in patients with GP.
Discuss potential adverse effects of metoclopramide with patients before initiating treatment. The FDA has issued a black box warning regarding the risk of tardive dyskinesia. Recognize that patients on psychotropic agents and older patients may be at higher risk for adverse events leading to discontinuation, although the absolute risk is low, including the risk of tardive dyskinesia. Initiate typical dosing with the oral formulation at 5 mg before meals, which can be increased up to 10 mg before meals. For intranasal metoclopramide, administer 15 mg before meals and at bedtime. Consider using practices to improve tolerability, such as starting at a low dose and implementing 1–4 weeks of drug holidays every 8–12 weeks. Assess medication efficacy and adverse effects, including movement disorders, at 4–8 weeks to determine whether to continue treatment. Monitor efficacy and adverse effects for the duration of metoclopramide therapy.

### Macrophages in diabetic gastroparesis – the missing link? [^90e73cc8]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetic gastroparesis results in significant morbidity for patients and major economic burden for society. Treatment options for diabetic gastroparesis are currently directed at symptom control rather than the underlying disease and are limited. The pathophysiology of diabetic gastroparesis includes damage to intrinsic and extrinsic neurons, smooth muscle, and interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC). Oxidative damage in diabetes appears to be one of the primary insults involved in the pathogenesis of several complications of diabetes, including gastroparesis. Recent studies have highlighted the potential role of macrophages as key cellular elements in the pathogenesis of diabetic gastroparesis. Macrophages are important for both homeostasis and defense against a variety of pathogens. Heme oxygenase 1 (HO1), an enzyme expressed in a subset of macrophages has emerged as a major protective mechanism against oxidative stress. Activation of macrophages with high levels of HO1 expression protects against development of delayed gastric emptying in animal models of diabetes, while activation of macrophages that do not express HO1 are linked to neuromuscular cell injury. Targeting macrophages and HO1 may therefore be a therapeutic option in diabetic gastroparesis.

Purpose

This report briefly reviews the pathophysiology of diabetic gastroparesis with a focus on oxidative damage and how activation and polarization of different subtypes of macrophages in the muscularis propria determines development of delay in gastric emptying or protects against its development.

### United European Gastroenterology (UEG) and European Society for Neurogastroenterology and Motility (ESNM) consensus on gastroparesis [^1be1dc84]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Gastroparesis is a condition characterized by epigastric symptoms and delayed gastric emptying (GE) rate in the absence of any mechanical obstruction. The condition is challenging in clinical practice by the lack of guidance concerning diagnosis and management of gastroparesis.

Methods

A Delphi consensus was undertaken by 40 experts from 19 European countries who conducted a literature summary and voting process on 89 statements. Quality of evidence was evaluated using grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation criteria. Consensus (defined as ≥ 80% agreement) was reached for 25 statements.

Results

The European consensus defined gastroparesis as the presence of symptoms associated with delayed GE in the absence of mechanical obstruction. Nausea and vomiting were identified as cardinal symptoms, with often coexisting postprandial distress syndrome symptoms of dyspepsia. The true epidemiology of gastroparesis is not known in detail, but diabetes, gastric surgery, certain neurological and connective tissue diseases, and the use of certain drugs recognized as risk factors. While the panel agreed that severely impaired gastric motor function is present in these patients, there was no consensus on underlying pathophysiology. The panel agreed that an upper endoscopy and a GE test are required for diagnosis. Only dietary therapy, dopamine-2 antagonists and 5-HT 4 receptor agonists were considered appropriate therapies, in addition to nutritional support in case of severe weight loss. No consensus was reached on the use of proton pump inhibitors, other classes of antiemetics or prokinetics, neuromodulators, complimentary, psychological, or more invasive therapies. Finally, there was consensus that gastroparesis adversely impacts on quality of life and healthcare costs and that the long-term prognosis of gastroparesis depends on the cause.

Conclusions and Inferences

A multinational group of European experts summarized the current state of consensus on definition, symptom characteristics, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of gastroparesis.

### Gastroparesis: clinical update [^ba6d7655]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis refers to chronically abnormal gastric motility characterized by symptoms suggestive of mechanical obstruction and delayed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction. It may be idiopathic or attributable to neuropathic or myopathic abnormalities, such as diabetes mellitus, postvagotomy, postviral infection, and scleroderma. Dietary and behavioral modification, prokinetic drugs, and surgical interventions have been used in managing patients with gastroparesis. Although mild gastroparesis is usually well managed with these treatment options, severe gastroparesis may be very difficult to control and may require referral to a specialist center if symptoms are intractable despite pharmacological therapy and dietetic support. New advances in drug therapy, botulinum toxin injection, and gastric electrical stimulation techniques have been introduced and might provide new hope to patients with refractory gastroparesis. This article critically reviews the advances in the field from the perspective of the clinician.

### Diabetic gastroparesis: principles and current trends in management [^1c25756f]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

This article is a comprehensive review of diabetic gastroparesis, defined as delayed or disordered gastric emptying, including basic principles and current trends in management. This review includes sections on anatomy and physiology, diagnosis and differential diagnosis as well as management and current guidelines for treatment of diabetic gastroparesis. Diabetic gastroparesis (DGp) is a component of autonomic neuropathy resulting from long-standing poorly controlled type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The diagnostic workup of DGp first excludes obstruction and other causes including medications that may mimic delayed/disordered gastric emptying. Targeting nutrition, hydration, symptomatic relief and glycemic control are mainstays of treatment for DGp. Additionally, optimal treatment of DGp includes good glycemic management, often involving customizing insulin delivery using basal-bolus insulin and technology, including sensor-augmented pumps and continuous glucose monitoring systems. Prokinetic medications may be helpful in DGp symptoms, although only limited number of medications is currently available in the USA. Selected medication-refractory patients with DGp may benefit from gastric neuromodulation, and some from surgical interventions including pyloric therapies that can also be done endoscopically. As is true of any of the diabetic complications, prevention of DGp by early and optimal glycemic control is more cost-effective. Funding: Hansa Medcell, India.

### Diabetic gastroparesis: therapeutic options [^c0e7a786]. Diabetes Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The rising prevalence of diabetes will inevitably result in increasing rates of chronic complications including gastroparesis. Patients develop a variety of symptoms that do not always correlate with the degree of abnormality on gastric emptying. Current treatment options are limited; however, novel investigational agents of the motilin and ghrelin class show promise. Intractable DG may require intervention with gastric electrical stimulation or surgery.

Metoclopramide for gastroparesis — Larger and more recent studies, including those using the intranasal formulation, showed a statistically significant benefit over placebo, and treatment with metoclopramide is indicated over no metoclopramide; however, because of the FDA black box warning and the recommendation to prescribe for only up to 12 weeks, the panel noted implementation and acceptability concerns. The absolute risk of tardive dyskinesia with metoclopramide use is described as low, with prescription database studies estimating prevalences of 1 in 17,800 and 1 in approximately 35,000 prescriptions, and a 2019 review estimating a risk in the range of 0.1% to 1.0% per 1000 patient-years. Increased risk of adverse events leading to discontinuation may be seen more often in older individuals or those on psychotropic agents. The Guideline Panel Content Experts usually assess efficacy at 4–8 weeks to decide on continuation, and since the FDA suggested treatment duration of 3 months, many clinicians give a drug holiday of 1 week to 1 month to determine whether further treatment is needed. One database study reported continuous use for a median duration of 490 days.

### Gastroparesis [^f71ec4b1]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Gastroparesis is a common disorder that produces symptoms of gastric retention in the absence of physical obstruction. Extensive research into the clinical features, pathophysiology, diagnostic evaluation, and therapy of gastroparesis in the past several years has offered insight into the condition. This review provides updated information on gastroparesis focusing on new findings from the past few years.

Recent Findings

Large database studies have characterized clinical profiles in idiopathic and diabetic gastroparesis and are defining roles of gastric and extragastric factors in symptom genesis. Dietary deficiencies in gastroparesis have been clarified. Histologic study of full thickness gastric tissue in severe gastroparesis shows heterogeneous enteric neuronal, smooth muscle, interstitial cell, and inflammatory abnormalities. Advances in gastric emptying testing include wireless motility capsules and nonradioactive breath tests. The importance of glycemic control in diabetic gastroparesis is a focus of current investigation. Novel therapies include new prokinetics (ghrelin agonists), increased focus on antiemetic agents including antidepressants, and next generation gastric stimulators. Studies are being initiated to delineate the natural history of gastroparesis.

Summary

Much has been learned recently on the causes, clinical presentations, and management of gastroparesis. Current ongoing investigation provides promise for further gains in the years ahead.

### Gastroparesis in children [^ba432dd1]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Outcome

Two retrospective studies in large pediatric cohorts provide useful data on the outcome of gastroparesis in children. The first study demonstrated resolution of symptoms in 52% of the patients after a median follow-up period of 18 months and found that factors such as younger age, postviral etiology, shorter duration of symptoms, response to prokinetics and presence of nausea correlated with a favorable outcome. The second study revealed significant symptom improvement in 60% of the patients after a mean follow-up period of 24 months, and showed that favorable outcome was not related to gender, age, or degree of GE delay. These data, although conflicting, further enrich our understanding of gastroparesis in children. Additionally, these studies differ from those performed in adults which show a high morbidity and mortality for this disease.

Gastroparesis — prokinetic therapy with metoclopramide: In individuals with gastroparesis, the AGA suggests using metoclopramide. As part of shared decision making, patients who place a higher value on the potential risk of adverse events and lower value on the symptomatic improvement may reasonably select not to use metoclopramide. Implementation considerations state that potential adverse effects of metoclopramide should be discussed before starting treatment, the FDA issued a black box warning regarding the risk of tardive dyskinesia, and patients on psychotropic agents and older individuals may be at higher risk for adverse events leading to discontinuation, but the absolute risk is low, including the risk of tardive dyskinesia. Typical dosing with the oral formulation starts with 5 mg before meals, which can be increased up to 10 mg before meals; for intranasal metoclopramide, the dose is 15 mg before meals and at bedtime. Practices to improve tolerability include starting at low dose and using 1–4 weeks drug holidays every 8–12 weeks. Medication efficacy and adverse effects, including movement disorders, are usually assessed at 4–8 weeks to decide whether to continue, and then monitored for the duration of treatment.

Domperidone — AGA recommendation and implementation in gastroparesis: In individuals with gastroparesis, the AGA suggests against use of domperidone as a first-line treatment (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Domperidone may be especially helpful for patients with gastroparesis who had neurologic adverse effects with metoclopramide; for patients with neurologic movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease; and for patients declining use of metoclopramide due to concerns of its adverse effects. Domperidone is not approved by the FDA in the United States for human use and prescription requires an expanded access use investigational new drug (IND) application from the FDA. Before starting treatment with domperidone, patients should have blood work for serum potassium and magnesium and undergo an electrocardiogram (ECG) at baseline for measurement of the QTc interval. The Guideline Panel Experts usually assess the efficacy of domperidone at 4–8 weeks to decide whether the treatment should be continued, and serum potassium, magnesium, and ECG QTc interval are monitored while a patient is treated with domperidone.

### AGA clinical practice update on gastric peroral endoscopic myotomy for gastroparesis: commentary [^5f47b679]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Potential causes of gastroparesis — Endocrine etiologies include diabetes, and diabetes accounts for approximately 25% of gastroparesis cases. Post-surgical etiologies are typically due to partial or complete vagotomy, which may be intended or unintended (eg, esophagectomy, Billroth II gastrectomy, and fundoplication or hernia repair), and symptomatic gastroparesis is a common adverse event after lung or heart-lung transplantation. Endoscopic sleeve gastrectomy may delay gastric emptying by constraining the middle and distal stomach. Medication-related causes include agents that delay gastric emptying (eg, anticholinergics and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists) and opioids, which can induce pyloric dysfunction and gastric stasis and are a common, iatrogenic, and potentially reversible cause of gastroparesis. Post-viral gastroparesis is usually a self-limited disorder, although the course can be prolonged in some patients, and idiopathic disease is the most common form of gastroparesis.

Epidemiology and Natural History of Diabetic Gastroparesis

Gastroparesis is a relatively common complication of diabetes, but often goes unrecognized.

About one-third of patients with gastroparesis have diabetes. In the USA, an estimated 5 million patients suffer from some form of gastroparesis, and the female:male ratio is 4:1. While gastroparesis has multiple etiologies, in a large single-center study of 146 gastroparesis patients, 29% were found to have diabetes, 13% developed symptoms after gastric surgery and 36% were idiopathic. Nevertheless, little is known about the epidemiology of DGp, in part because the weak association between symptoms and objective studies of gastric emptying confounds diagnosis.

Diabetes affects gastric motor function more than small bowel transit, indicating an increased sensitivity of the stomach to diabetic injury. Approximately 75% of patients with diabetes have some form of GI symptoms and about 18% experience upper GI symptoms. In an Australian epidemiological study, diabetes mellitus was associated with an increased prevalence of upper and lower GI symptoms, which were linked to poor glycemic control but not to duration of diabetes or type of treatment.

The key points of this article are anorexia and cachexia are: A major cause of cancer deaths. Several drugs are available to treat anorexia and cachexia. Dyspnea in cancer usually is caused by several factors. Treatment consists of reversing underlying causes, empiric bronchodilators, cortico-steroids — and in the terminally ill patients-opioids, benzodiazepines, and chlorpromazine. Delirium is associated with advanced cancer. Empiric treatment with neuroleptics while evaluating for reversible causes is a reasonable approach to management. Nausea and vomiting are caused by extra-abdominal factors (drugs, electrolyte abnormalities, central nervous system metastases) or intra-abdominal factors (gastroparesis, ileus, gastric outlet obstruction, bowel obstruction). The pattern of nausea and vomiting differs depending upon whether the cause is extra- or intra-abdominal. Reversible causes should be sought and empiric metoclopramide or haloperidol should be initiated. Fatigue may be caused by anemia, depression, endocrine abnormalities, or electrolyte disturbances that should be treated before using empiric methylphenidate. Constipation should be treated with laxatives and stool softeners. Both should start with the first opioid dose.

This editorial addresses the importance of diabetic gastroparesis as a marker of poor glycemic control, other vascular complications, and suboptimal therapeutic outcomes. Highlighting the need to prevent and manage gastroparesis, it tries to understand why the condition has not received its due share of attention. Complexities in screening, diagnosis, and management all contribute to the lack of focus on this autonomic neuropathy. The editorial reinforces the need to enhance awareness about diabetic gastroparesis and utilize good clinical sense and rational prescription writing in order to limit the impact of this complication.

### Gastroparesis: a review of current diagnosis and treatment options [^8c14eeea]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis (GP) is a chronic neuromuscular disorder of the upper gastrointestinal tract. The incidence of GP is not well described; however, the number of individuals affected by symptoms of GP in the United States is estimated to be over 4 million. The etiology of GP is diverse. Approximately 25% of cases are associated with diabetes, whereas nearly 50% are classified as idiopathic; many of these latter cases likely represent a postinfectious process. Connective tissue disorders, autoimmune disorders, prior gastric surgery, ischemia, and medications make up the vast majority of the remaining cases. The pathophysiology of GP is also diverse. Abnormalities in fundic tone, antroduodenal dyscoordination, a weak antral pump, gastric dysrhythmias, and abnormal duodenal feedback all contribute to delays in gastric emptying and symptom expression. Characteristic symptoms of GP include nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, early satiety, and weight loss. The diagnosis of GP is made using a combination of characteristic symptoms in conjunction with objective evidence of delayed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction. Once the diagnosis is made, treatment options include dietary modification, medications to accelerate gastric emptying, antiemetic agents, gastric electrical stimulation, and surgery. In the following sections we will provide an overview of the health care impact of GP, describe the underlying pathophysiology, and review treatment options using an evidence-based approach.

Enteric Neuropathy

Patients with gastroparesis often show evidence of autonomic neuropathy. Studies suggest that both the sympathetic and parasympathetic components of the autonomic nervous system are affected in DGp since abnormalities have been described in the axons and dendrites within the prevertebral sympathetic ganglia. The pancreatic polypeptide response is blunted and gastric secretion is reduced in patients with DGp when vagus nerve function is stimulated by sham feeding. Hyperglycemia may cause vagus nerve dysfunction due to demyelination. After restoration of normal glycemic control and renal function with pancreas–kidney transplantation, diabetic autonomic and peripheral neuropathy can be partially reversible with improved gastric function.

Intrinsic Mechanisms

An increased level of oxidative stress caused by low levels of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is associated with DGp in experimental models. Increasing the expression of HO-1 or improving the function of nitrergic mechanisms through experimental approaches protects against the development of gastroparesis or restores gastric emptying in diabetic mice and rats, respectively.

Both animal and human studies suggest that the most common gastric cellular defects in gastroparesis are the loss of expression of nNOS and the loss of ICC. However, post-translational modification of nNOS may be more important than absolute nNOS levels.

Electric pacemaker activity drives peristaltic and segmental contractions in the gastrointestinal tract, and the ICC are responsible for spontaneous pacemaker activity. Loss of ICC is the most common enteric abnormality in DGp and idiopathic gastroparesis. The stomach shows distinct regional variations in the distribution of subtypes of ICC from the cardia to pylorus, whereas the small intestine and colon both seem to retain nearly the same distribution pattern of subtypes of ICC throughout each organ. All subtypes of ICC share common ultrastructural features, such as the presence of numerous mitochondria, abundant intermediate filaments and the formation of gap junctions with the same type of cells and with smooth muscle cells. ICC are responsible for multiple functions in the GI tract. ICC generate slow waves that control smooth muscle contractility, are involved in aspects of neurotransmission, set the smooth muscle membrane potential gradient and are involved in mechanotransduction as shown in Fig. 10.

### Therapy insight: gastrointestinal complications of diabetes – pathophysiology and management [^c6196728]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2008). Medium credibility.

Patients with diabetes often have gastrointestinal symptoms, but the extent and severity of this problem and the specificity of the symptoms are not nearly as well defined as frequently assumed. Any part of the gastrointestinal tract can be affected, and the presenting symptoms depend on the composite of dysfunctional elements. Gastroesophageal reflux, Candida esophagitis, gastroparesis, diarrhea and constipation are among the many common gastrointestinal complications of diabetes. No specific risk factor for the development of these complications has been identified and their etiology is most likely to be multifactorial, involving both reversible and irreversible processes. Treatment should be directed at tighter glycemic and symptom control, which can bring about clinical improvement for many patients. For other patients, however, effective clinical management is problematic because no therapies are available to prevent or correct the underlying disease mechanisms. Studies now suggest that reduced levels of key trophic factors cause transdifferentiation of pacemaker interstitial cells of Cajal into a smooth-muscle-like phenotype. If this really is the case, therapies directed at restoring the normal milieu of trophic signals could correct the dysfunction of the interstitial cells of Cajal and resolve many gastrointestinal complications. Advances in stem cell technology also hold promise to provide a cure for diabetes and to correct abnormalities in gastrointestinal pathology.
