## Question

Young woman with a resolving febrile viral upper respiratory illness; question asks which hypothalamic region with warm-sensitive neurons mediates fever changes.

A 20-year-old woman reports to student health complaining of 5 days of viral symptoms including sneezing and a runny nose. She started coughing 2 days ago and is seeking cough medication. She additionally mentions that she developed a fever 2 days ago, but this has resolved. On exam, her temperature is 99.0°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 118/76 mmHg, pulse is 86/min, and respirations are 12/min. Changes in the activity of warm-sensitive neurons in which part of her hypothalamus likely contributed to the development and resolution of her fever?

Answer Choices:
A. Anterior hypothalamus
B. Lateral area
C. Paraventricular nucleus
D. Suprachiasmatic nucleus

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which hypothalamic region contains warm-sensitive neurons that mediate the development and resolution of fever in a young woman recovering from a viral URI. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core thermoregulatory circuitry in the hypothalamus. Then, I should verify which nucleus houses warm-sensitive neurons that detect deviations from set-point and trigger heat-dissipation responses. Next, I will examine the other options (lateral area, paraventricular nucleus, suprachiasmatic nucleus) to ensure they do not better fit the question. Finally, I will reconcile any apparent contradictions between anterior versus preoptic terminology and confirm the best answer choice based on contemporary evidence.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental neurophysiology. Fever arises when prostaglandin E2 shifts the thermoregulatory set-point upward; warm-sensitive neurons in the hypothalamus detect when core temperature exceeds the new set-point and activate heat-loss mechanisms to return temperature toward the set-point, thereby contributing to both the rise and fall of fever as the set-point normalizes [^ae65ccaa].

> Now, I need to check the exact anatomical locus of these warm-sensitive neurons. Wait, let me verify the terminology. Classic teaching places warm-sensitive neurons in the anterior hypothalamus, but more recent mechanistic work pinpoints the preoptic area as the critical node for thermoregulatory control, including a negative feedback circuit that counters fever. Given that the preoptic area is part of the anterior hypothalamic region, the most precise and evidence-aligned answer here is the anterior hypothalamus/preoptic area, which contains the warm-sensitive neurons that mediate heat-dissipation responses during fever resolution [^ae65ccaa] [^d3a30ff2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review the distractors. The lateral hypothalamic area is important for arousal and energy balance but is not the primary site of warm-sensitive thermoregulatory neurons. The paraventricular nucleus integrates neuroendocrine and autonomic outputs but is not the thermosensitive controller. The suprachiasmatic nucleus is the master circadian clock and influences diurnal temperature rhythms, but it does not house the warm-sensitive neurons that execute acute thermoregulatory responses to fever, so these alternatives do not fit the question's mechanism [^7fc10b0a] [^4bf3a268] [^b5d08297].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "preoptic area" might be offered as a separate option; since it is not, I should confirm that "anterior hypothalamus" is the closest and correct choice among the listed answers. Contemporary work explicitly identifies the preoptic area as the thermoregulatory hub, and anatomically the preoptic area lies within the anterior hypothalamic region, so selecting anterior hypothalamus is appropriate and consistent with current circuit-level understanding of fever control [^ae65ccaa] [^d3a30ff2].

> Putting this together, the warm-sensitive neurons that detect elevation above the fever set-point and drive heat-loss responses reside in the anterior hypothalamus (preoptic area), making Option A the correct answer. The other options correspond to different hypothalamic functions and do not house the thermosensitive neurons responsible for fever mediation and resolution [^ae65ccaa] [^d3a30ff2].

---

The correct answer is **anterior hypothalamus** (preoptic area), where warm-sensitive neurons detect elevated core temperature and trigger heat-dissipation responses that mediate fever resolution [^ae65ccaa]. The suprachiasmatic nucleus regulates circadian rhythms, the paraventricular nucleus controls neuroendocrine and autonomic outputs, and the lateral hypothalamus is involved in arousal and feeding — none of these regions house the warm-sensitive neurons central to fever control [^4bf3a268] [^7fc10b0a] [^254faf7a].

---

## Hypothalamic regulation of body temperature

The hypothalamus is the **primary control center** for thermoregulation, integrating peripheral and central temperature signals to maintain a stable core temperature [^48679aeb]. Within the hypothalamus, the **preoptic area of the anterior hypothalamus** contains warm-sensitive neurons that detect increases in core temperature and initiate heat-dissipation responses, such as vasodilation, sweating, and reduced metabolic heat production [^ae65ccaa].

---

## Role of warm-sensitive neurons in fever

During infection, pyrogens (e.g. prostaglandin E2) raise the hypothalamic set-point, triggering fever. Warm-sensitive neurons in the anterior hypothalamus detect when core temperature exceeds this new set-point and activate heat-loss mechanisms to return temperature to the set-point, thereby mediating **fever resolution** [^ae65ccaa].

---

## Anatomical location of warm-sensitive neurons

Warm-sensitive neurons are concentrated in the **preoptic area of the anterior hypothalamus**, which receives direct input from peripheral thermoreceptors and integrates this information to coordinate thermoregulatory responses [^ae65ccaa].

---

## Alternative options analysis

| **Option** | **Hypothalamic region** | **Function** | **Relevance to fever** |
|-|-|-|-|
| A | Anterior hypothalamus | Thermoregulation, including warm-sensitive neurons | Directly mediates fever development and resolution |
| B | Lateral hypothalamus | Arousal, feeding, reward | Not directly involved in fever regulation |
| C | Paraventricular nucleus | Neuroendocrine and autonomic control | Indirectly involved, but not primary thermoregulatory center |
| D | Suprachiasmatic nucleus | Circadian rhythm regulation | Not directly involved in fever regulation |

---

## Conclusion

The **anterior hypothalamus** (preoptic area) contains warm-sensitive neurons that detect elevated core temperature and initiate heat-dissipation responses, thereby mediating fever development and resolution. The other options are not primarily involved in thermoregulation.

Context

It has long been recognized that a "biological clock" residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus controls circadian or daily variations in physiological processes. Old observations are now being revisited after the discovery of the cellular mechanism of timekeeping, the molecular clock, an autoregulatory feedback loop of transcription factors that cycles over a period of approximately 24 h. Its functioning or breakdown impinges upon the physiology and pathophysiology of numerous systems, including the endocrine system and metabolism. Here we provide an introduction to those aspects of the clock most relevant to the endocrinologist.

Evidence Acquisition

Articles were identified by searching PubMed using the search terms "circadian" and "clock" and refining results to include articles relating to endocrinology and metabolism.

Evidence Synthesis

We discuss current understanding of the mechanisms through which hormonal and metabolic axes fall under the influence of the circadian clock. Of particular interest is the complex interaction of genetic and environmental factors in determining health or disease states.

Conclusions

Research into the molecular clock provides a novel window onto endocrine and metabolic disease. These advances present new avenues for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

RESULTS

Effect of D/L exposure on gene expression in the clock pathway in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of 6- and 18-month-old 3×Tg-AD and Non-Tg mice

Since the major circadian pacemaker in mammals is located in the SCN, we first determined whether the variations in clock gene expressions occurring after a 12 h D/L cycle was observed in the 6- and 18-month-old 3×Tg-AD and Non-Tg mice littermates, referred as the mild and severe pathology group, respectively (Fig. 1). To this aim, animals were sacrificed at CT 07:00 h (after exposure to D) or at CT 19:00 h (after exposure to L) and the variability of core clock gene expressions was analyzed. The results obtained by the statistical analysis aimed to test the main effects of D/L, G, A and the interactions D/L×G, D/L×A, G×A, and D/L×A×G are shown in Table 1.

### Circadian rhythm sleep disorders [^91ea5dd0]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Humans exhibit endogenous circadian rhythms that are regulated by the master circadian clock of the body, the suprachiasmatic nucleus. These endogenous circadian rhythms are aligned to the outside world by social and environmental cues. Circadian rhythm sleep disorders (CRSD) occur when there is an alteration of the internal timing mechanism or a misalignment between sleep and the 24-h social and physical environment. CRSD are often underrecognized yet should be considered in the differential of patients presenting with symptoms of insomnia and/or hypersomnia. Because behavioral and environmental factors often are involved in the development and maintenance of these conditions, a multimodal treatment approach of behavioral and/or pharmacologic approaches is usually required to synchronize a patient's circadian rhythm to the 24-h environment, consolidate sleep, and improve alertness. Rapid advances in our understanding of the physiologic, cellular, and molecular basis of circadian rhythm and sleep regulation will likely lead to improved diagnostic tools and treatments for CRSD.

II. The Circadian System

A. The suprachiasmatic nuclei

The two suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the anterior hypothalamus primarily coordinate the oscillator systems that temporally regulate physiology and behavior (Figure 1). The preeminent roles of the SCN in locomotor, hormonal, and feeding circadian rhythms were demonstrated by early ablation studies. SCN transplantation into SCN-ablated hamsters confirmed their control of circadian rhythm period and by encasing the SCN in semipermeable membranes that prevented synaptogenesis, the SCN were shown to produce diffusible signals sufficient to restore circadian activity rhythms. Several of these SCN secretions have since been identified.

Figure 1.
Temporal control of physiology. Light exposure provides the primary time cue for the central clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus and suppresses melatonin synthesis by the pineal gland. Artificial light exposure at night can therefore disrupt the SCN clock and melatonin rhythm. As a diurnal species, melatonin is hypnogenic in humans, although a recent prospective study of pinealectomy demonstrated that endogenous melatonin may not have a strong regulatory role in sleep. The sleep/wake cycle has been effectively simulated by a two-process model in which a circadian process (C) influences wakefulness and interacts with a sleep-promoting process (S) that accumulates during wakefulness. Within the hypothalamus — a nodal point of body temperature regulation — the SCN influences the circadian rhythm of body temperature, a key synchronizer of clocks in peripheral tissues. The use of thermostats can obviate daily oscillations in temperature, which could perhaps influence some circadian rhythms. In addition to temperature mechanisms, the SCN influences clocks in peripheral tissues through neural signals communicated via the autonomic nervous system (ANS), as well as the timely secretion of signaling factors such as prokineticin 2. Hypothalamic-pituitary-peripheral organ axes are important to hormonal regulation of the circadian system. For example, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) enters the portal system through the median eminence (ME) of the hypothalamus and stimulates the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by the anterior pituitary gland. ACTH then regulates adrenal cortex production of cortisol, a hormone with a robust circadian oscillation and important synchronizing effects in many peripheral clocks. The timing of metabolic processes in peripheral clocks is also modified by nutritional status, and peripheral clocks relay metabolic information back to the hypothalamus through the ME. Today, around-the-clock access to food can distort the clear feeding/fasting cycles that typified much of our history.

### Measuring seasonal time within the circadian system: regulation of the suprachiasmatic nuclei by photoperiod [^461976aa]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2005). Low credibility.

Day-length (photoperiod) is the primary environmental signal used to synchronise endogenous rhythms of physiology and behaviour. In mammals, the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus house the master circadian clock. The SCN incorporate photoperiodic information and therefore measure both daily and seasonal time. Over the past decade, there have been significant advances in the understanding of the molecular basis of circadian clocks. It is now becoming apparent that the core molecular clock mechanism is itself regulated by photoperiod, although there is currently debate as to how this occurs. One recent model proposes that distinct groups of core 'clock genes' are associated with either morning or evening phases of the daily light/dark cycle. However, the validity of associating particular genes to morning and evening has been questioned. This article reviews the evidence for photoperiodic regulation of circadian clock function and then discusses alternative models that may explain the available data.

### Changes in circadian rhythm in chronically-starved mice are associated with glial cell density reduction in the suprachiasmatic nucleus [^097dd77c]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

3.5 Starvation Induces a Reduction in + and + Cell Densities in the

Next, we analyzed the influence of starvation on glial cells in the SCN of the hypothalamus (Figure 6), as changes in circadian rhythm may be induced by cellular alterations in the SCN.

FIGURE 6
Chronic starvation leads to decreased astrocyte and oligodendrocyte cell density in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. After refeeding, glial cell densities in the suprachiasmatic nucleus remain unaltered. Cell densities of (A) GFAP +, (B) IBA1 +, and (C) OLIG2 + in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of SIH and control mice after chronic starvation. The arrows mark (A) GFAP +, (B) IBA1 +, and (C) OLIG2 + cells. Scale bar = 100 μm. Two‐sided Student's t ‐test for GFAP + and OLIG2 + cells, Mann–Whitney test for IBA1 + cells. (D) Cell densities of GFAP +, IBA1 +, and OLIG2 + in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of SIH and control mice after refeeding. Two‐sided Student's t ‐test. ✱✱ p ≤ 0.01, ✱✱ p ≤ 0.001 (Control_chronic: n = 4; SIH_chronic: n = 8; Control_refeeding: n = 10; SIH_refeeding: n = 9).

Chronic starvation induced a decrease in GFAP + cells in this region (Figures 6A and S3). Additionally, although not significantly different, starvation led to a reduction in the density of IBA1 + microglial cells. Further, chronic starvation led to a reduction of OLIG2 + cells in SIH mice compared to controls (Figures 6C and S3). After refeeding, no alteration in glial cell densities was observed in SIH mice compared to controls (Figures 6D and S4). In summary, while chronic starvation led to reduced densities of GFAP + and OLIG2 + cells in the SCN, the density of IBA1 + cells remained unchanged.

### Discrete photoentrainment of mammalian central clock is regulated by bi-stable dynamic network in the suprachiasmatic nucleus [^6e2eba75]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

In summary, our methodological approach, employing two-photon excitation for spatial analysis, offers a minimally perturbative tool for studying SCN networks longitudinally. This advancement opens doors to exploring the fine-grained spatial organization of the SCN at single cell level in vivo and its implications for circadian photoentrainment. The identification of distinct neuronal groups that are responsive to light at different circadian times provides new insights beyond the traditional hierarchical model of circadian photoentrainment. This discovery lays the groundwork for future research into the identification of molecular markers and functional roles of the SCN neuronal subtypes, illuminating the underlying mechanisms for matching the endogenous clock with the external light-dark cycle in mammals.

### Discrete photoentrainment of mammalian central clock is regulated by bi-stable dynamic network in the suprachiasmatic nucleus [^b046445b]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

To determine whether this network is driven by local connections, we identified neurons with high connectivity based on their correlation coefficients (r > 0.5). We found three distinct functional connectivity maps corresponding to ZT 8, ZT 16, and ZT 22, with no clear spatial clustering among the highly connected neurons (Fig. 5e and Supplementary Fig. 10). We then mapped the correlation coefficients against the inter-neuronal distances during the light exposure period across all three time points. A locally driven network would typically exhibit a negative correlation between neuronal distance and correlation coefficient. Contrary to this expectation, the relationship between the neurons' connectivity and their physical proximity was negligible, with an average r-squared value of only 0.04 (Fig. 5f). Collectively, these observations suggest that SCN neuronal light responses are orchestrated by a complex network architecture in 3-dimensional space rather than simple local circuits.

### Suprachiasmatic nucleus-arcuate nucleus axis: interaction between time and metabolism essential for health [^06db01ee]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

In mammals, time and metabolism are tightly coupled variables; this relationship can be illustrated by numerous examples, such as the circadian variation in food intake or the circadian response to a glucose bolus. We review evidence that the interaction between the suprachiasmatic nucleus and the arcuate nucleus plays a key role in the execution of these functions. The nuclei are reciprocally connected via different projections, and this interaction provides an ideal anatomical framework to modify the temporal output of the hypothalamus to metabolic organs as a consequence of the feedback from the periphery. The suprachiasmatic nucleus-arcuate nucleus relationship is essential to integrate metabolic information into the circadian system and thus adapt circadian rhythms in core body temperature, locomotor activity, food intake, and circulating molecules such as glucose and corticosterone. With the rise in obesity-associated diseases in the world population, gaining knowledge about this relationship, and the consequences of disturbing this liaison, is essential to understand the pathogenesis of obesity.

### The brain's master circadian clock: implications and opportunities for therapy of sleep disorders [^b5d08297]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

The suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) residing in the anterior hypothalamus maintains a near-24-h rhythm of electrical activity, even in the absence of environmental cues. This circadian rhythm is generated by intrinsic molecular mechanisms in the neurons of the SCN; however, the circadian clock is modulated by a wide variety of influences, including glutamate and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) from the retinohypothalamic tract, melatonin from the pineal gland, and neuropeptide Y from the intergeniculate leaflet. By virtue of these and other inputs, the SCN responds to environmental cues such as light, social and physical activities. In turn, the SCN controls or influences a wide variety of physiologic and behavioral functions, including attention, endocrine cycles, body temperature, melatonin secretion, and the sleep-wake cycle. Regulation of the sleep-wake cycle by the SCN has important implications for development of therapies for sleep disorders, including those involving desynchronization of circadian rhythms and insomnia.

### The suprachiasmatic nucleus, circadian clocks, and the liver [^a30a7675]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

The circadian clock system adapts phasic physiological activities, such as sleeping and eating, to environmental cycles. The "master clock" is in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and the principal cue (Zeitgeber) is the light–dark cycle, around which most mammalian (and those of all living organisms) functions have evolved. In our society, with activity 24 h per day, the clock is frequently overridden or does not match the activity schedule, with increased susceptibility to disease (obesity, type 2 diabetes, and their cardiovascular sequelae) resulting.

### Discrete photoentrainment of mammalian central clock is regulated by bi-stable dynamic network in the suprachiasmatic nucleus [^76bf08fc]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The biological clock synchronizes with the environmental light-dark cycle through circadian photoentrainment. While intracellular pathways regulating clock gene expression after light exposure in the suprachiasmatic nucleus are well studied in mammals, the neuronal circuits driving phase shifts remain unclear. Here, using a mouse model, we show that chemogenetic activation of early-night light-responsive neurons induces phase delays at any circadian time, potentially breaking the photoentrainment dead zone. In contrast, activating late-night light-responsive neurons mimics light-induced phase shifts. Using in vivo two-photon microscopy, we found that most neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus exhibit stochastic light responses, while a small subset is consistently activated in the early subjective night and another is inhibited in the late subjective night. Our findings suggest a dynamic bi-stable network model for circadian photoentrainment, where phase shifts arise from a functional circuit integrating signals to groups of outcome neurons, rather than a labeled-line principle seen in sensory systems.

### Circadian regulation of intracellular G-protein signalling mediates intercellular synchrony and rhythmicity in the suprachiasmatic nucleus [^d760cc93]. Nature Communications (2011). Medium credibility.

Synchronous oscillations of thousands of cellular clocks in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the circadian centre, are coordinated by precisely timed cell–cell communication, the principle of which is largely unknown. Here we show that the amount of RGS16 (regulator of G protein signalling 16), a protein known to inactivate Gαi, increases at a selective circadian time to allow time-dependent activation of intracellular cyclic AMP signalling in the SCN. Gene ablation of Rgs16 leads to the loss of circadian production of cAMP and as a result lengthens circadian period of behavioural rhythm. The temporally precise regulation of the cAMP signal by clock-controlled RGS16 is needed for the dorsomedial SCN to maintain a normal phase-relationship to the ventrolateral SCN. Thus, RGS16-dependent temporal regulation of intracellular G protein signalling coordinates the intercellular synchrony of SCN pacemaker neurons and thereby defines the 24 h rhythm in behaviour.

### Suprachiasmatic VIP neurons are required for normal circadian rhythmicity and comprised of molecularly distinct subpopulations [^72c36a9d]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The hypothalamic suprachiasmatic (SCN) clock contains several neurochemically defined cell groups that contribute to the genesis of circadian rhythms. Using cell-specific and genetically targeted approaches we have confirmed an indispensable role for vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-expressing SCN (SCN VIP) neurons, including their molecular clock, in generating the mammalian locomotor activity (LMA) circadian rhythm. Optogenetic-assisted circuit mapping revealed functional, di-synaptic connectivity between SCN VIP neurons and dorsomedial hypothalamic neurons, providing a circuit substrate by which SCN VIP neurons may regulate LMA rhythms. In vivo photometry revealed that while SCN VIP neurons are acutely responsive to light, their activity is otherwise behavioral state invariant. Single-nuclei RNA-sequencing revealed that SCN VIP neurons comprise two transcriptionally distinct subtypes, including putative pacemaker and non-pacemaker populations. Altogether, our work establishes necessity of SCN VIP neurons for the LMA circadian rhythm, elucidates organization of circadian outflow from and modulatory input to SCN VIP cells, and demonstrates a subpopulation-level molecular heterogeneity that suggests distinct functions for specific SCN VIP subtypes.

### Sleep States alter activity of suprachiasmatic nucleus neurons [^a42f136b]. Nature Neuroscience (2003). Medium credibility.

The timing of sleep and wakefulness in mammals is governed by a sleep homeostatic process and by the circadian clock of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which has a molecular basis for rhythm generation. By combining SCN electrical activity recordings with electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings in the same animal (the Wistar rat), we discovered that changes in vigilance states are paralleled by strong changes in SCN electrophysiological activity. During rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, neuronal activity in the SCN was elevated, and during non-REM (NREM) sleep, it was lowered. We also carried out selective sleep deprivation experiments to confirm that changes in SCN electrical activity are caused by changes in vigilance state. Our results indicate that the 24-hour pattern in electrical activity that is controlled by the molecular machinery of the SCN is substantially modified by afferent information from the central nervous system.

### Circadian VIPergic neurons of the suprachiasmatic nuclei sculpt the sleep-wake cycle [^3fa01b3e]. Neuron (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Almost all organisms have internal circadian clocks that consolidate sleep to night in diurnal organisms or day in nocturnal ones. Sleep duration and intensity are additionally regulated by a homeostatic mechanism dependent upon prior waking experience. Within this two-process model, it remains unclear to what extent the circadian clock acts as a "metronome" — indicating day and night — versus acting as an "orchestral conductor" — specifically shaping features of the sleep-wake cycle. Most animal species and all human cultures consolidate the majority of sleep to either day or night. Many also exhibit an additional period of sleep — a "siesta" — during the second half of the wake phase, followed by a period of increased alertness — the "wake maintenance zone" (WMZ) — thought to depend on sleep pressure. How the mammalian circadian oscillator shapes this complex pattern is unknown.

### The suprachiasmatic nucleus, circadian clocks, and the liver [^f74a37cd]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

The disruptions of circadian rhythms are maintained across the spectrum of lesions that were applied. Only the effects on the fat mass and on the liver are altered, suggesting a differential mechanism for this effect of SCNx. The extent to which this effect might be dependent on the clock function of the SCN therefore remains to be determined. However, evidence is presented here indicating that control of liver metabolism at the level of the SCN is modifiable.

### Two decades of circadian time [^a3732cfa]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2008). Low credibility.

Circadian rhythms coordinate our physiology at a fundamental level. Over the last 20 years, we have witnessed a paradigm shift in our perception of what the clocks driving such rhythms actually are, moving from 'black boxes' to talking about autoregulatory transcriptional/post-translational feedback loops with identified molecular components. We also now know that the pacemaker of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) is not our only clock but quite the opposite because circadian clocks abound in our bodies, driving local rhythms of cellular metabolism, and synchronised to each other and to solar time, by cues from the SCN. This discovery of dispersed local clocks has far-reaching implications for understanding our physiology and the pathological consequences of clock dysfunction, revealing that clocks are critical in a variety of metabolic and neurological conditions, all of which have long-term morbidity attributable to them. Without the currently available molecular framework, these insights would have not have been possible. In the circadian future, a growing appreciation of the systems-level functioning of these clocks and their various cerebral and visceral outputs, will likely stimulate the development of novel therapies for major illnesses.

### Circadian VIPergic neurons of the suprachiasmatic nuclei sculpt the sleep-wake cycle [^3acfcf74]. Neuron (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary

Although the mammalian rest-activity cycle is controlled by a "master clock" in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, it is unclear how firing of individual SCN neurons gates individual features of daily activity. Here, we demonstrate that a specific transcriptomically identified population of mouse VIP+ SCN neurons is active at the "wrong" time of day — nighttime — when most SCN neurons are silent. Using chemogenetic and optogenetic strategies, we show that these neurons and their cellular clocks are necessary and sufficient to gate and time nighttime sleep but have no effect upon daytime sleep. We propose that mouse nighttime sleep, analogous to the human siesta, is a "hard-wired" property gated by specific neurons of the master clock to favor subsequent alertness prior to dawn (a circadian "wake maintenance zone"). Thus, the SCN is not simply a 24-h metronome: specific populations sculpt critical features of the sleep-wake cycle.

### Suprachiasmatic neuron numbers and rest-activity circadian rhythms in older humans [^31a87897]. Annals of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, the master mammalian circadian pacemaker, synchronizes endogenous rhythms with the external day-night cycle. Older humans, particularly those with Alzheimer disease (AD), often have difficulty maintaining normal circadian rhythms compared to younger adults, but the basis of this change is unknown. We report that the circadian rhythm amplitude of motor activity in both AD subjects and age-matched controls is correlated with the number of vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing SCN neurons. AD was additionally associated with delayed circadian phase compared to cognitively healthy subjects, suggesting distinct pathologies and strategies for treating aging- and AD-related circadian disturbances.

### Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock [^c8faf4c9]. Human Molecular Genetics (2006). Low credibility.

Circadian rhythms are approximately 24-h oscillations in behavior and physiology, which are internally generated and function to anticipate the environmental changes associated with the solar day. A conserved transcriptional-translational autoregulatory loop generates molecular oscillations of 'clock genes' at the cellular level. In mammals, the circadian system is organized in a hierarchical manner, in which a master pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) regulates downstream oscillators in peripheral tissues. Recent findings have revealed that the clock is cell-autonomous and self-sustained not only in a central pacemaker, the SCN, but also in peripheral tissues and in dissociated cultured cells. It is becoming evident that specific contribution of each clock component and interactions among the components vary in a tissue-specific manner. Here, we review the general mechanisms of the circadian clockwork, describe recent findings that elucidate tissue-specific expression patterns of the clock genes and address the importance of circadian regulation in peripheral tissues for an organism's overall well-being.

### Circadian timekeeping and multiple timescale neuroendocrine rhythms [^142499a2]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

The hormones secreted by the anterior pituitary gland regulate major functions such as reproduction, as well as body growth and metabolism. Their efficiency of action highly depends on their temporal profile of release in the blood stream. This review summarises the recent evidence suggesting that the circadian clock genes that pace our daily rhythms may also contribute to the regulation of pituitary pulsatility, even in the non 24-h range. This inter-relation between molecular circadian oscillators and endocrine rhythmicities is discussed in light of the longstanding literature that has considered the involvement of the central circadian pacemaker located within the suprachiasmatic nuclei. Other arguments that suggest a role for circadian clock genes outside the suprachiasmatic nuclei are also presented, with a special emphasis on endocrine pituitary cells and hypothalamic neuroendocrine neurones that directly pace pituitary secretion rates.

### Astrocytes control circadian timekeeping in the suprachiasmatic nucleus via glutamatergic signaling [^535c04aa]. Neuron (2017). Low credibility.

Summary

The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus orchestrates daily rhythms of physiology and behavior in mammals. Its circadian (∼24 hr) oscillations of gene expression and electrical activity are generated intrinsically and can persist indefinitely in temporal isolation. This robust and resilient timekeeping is generally regarded as a product of the intrinsic connectivity of its neurons. Here we show that neurons constitute only one "half" of the SCN clock, the one metabolically active during circadian daytime. In contrast, SCN astrocytes are active during circadian nighttime, when they suppress the activity of SCN neurons by regulating extracellular glutamate levels. This glutamatergic gliotransmission is sensed by neurons of the dorsal SCN via specific pre-synaptic NMDA receptor assemblies containing NR2C subunits. Remarkably, somatic genetic re-programming of intracellular clocks in SCN astrocytes was capable of remodeling circadian behavioral rhythms in adult mice. Thus, SCN circuit-level timekeeping arises from interdependent and mutually supportive astrocytic-neuronal signaling.

### Circadian VIPergic neurons of the suprachiasmatic nuclei sculpt the sleep-wake cycle [^3fe4bb8c]. Neuron (2020). Medium credibility.

Although the mammalian rest-activity cycle is controlled by a "master clock" in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, it is unclear how firing of individual SCN neurons gates individual features of daily activity. Here, we demonstrate that a specific transcriptomically identified population of mouse VIP+ SCN neurons is active at the "wrong" time of day-nighttime-when most SCN neurons are silent. Using chemogenetic and optogenetic strategies, we show that these neurons and their cellular clocks are necessary and sufficient to gate and time nighttime sleep but have no effect upon daytime sleep. We propose that mouse nighttime sleep, analogous to the human siesta, is a "hard-wired" property gated by specific neurons of the master clock to favor subsequent alertness prior to dawn (a circadian "wake maintenance zone"). Thus, the SCN is not simply a 24-h metronome: specific populations sculpt critical features of the sleep-wake cycle.

### Sleep-wake pattern following gunshot suprachiasmatic damage [^850cfdb5]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) plays a critical role in maintaining melatonin and sleep-wake cycles.

Methods/Patient

We report a case of 38-year-old woman who, after gunshot wound to the right temple, developed a sleep complaint of multiple nocturnal awakenings and several naps throughout the day.

Results

Computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral optic nerve and optic chiasm damage. Diagnostic polysomnography and actigraphy revealed an irregular sleep wake rhythm.

Conclusions

We speculate concurrent damage of the SCN and optic nerves bilaterally resulted in the posttraumatic irregular sleep-wake rhythm.

Keeping time

Coordination of mammalian circadian timekeeping involves an integrated system composed of a central clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, and peripheral clocks in virtually all other cells and tissues. The coordinated integration of central and peripheral molecular clocks ensures that functions in different tissues occur at an appropriate time of day, such as sleeping at night and metabolising ingested nutrients during the day in the case of diurnal animals. Without these molecular clocks, there would be no temporal framework for daily processes. Although circadian clocks continue to tick indefinitely, they require careful adjusting to keep in time. The central clock in the SCN fulfils a key role in this, as it integrates input from external cues, known as Zeitgebers, to synchronise with the planetary light/dark cycle. Whereas light, perceived through the eye, is the strongest Zeitgeber for daily clock resetting (photoentrainment), other cues include temperature, feeding, exercise and social interaction. In turn, the SCN maintains synchrony of peripheral clocks through humoral and neural stimuli. Resetting the circadian clocks to alterations in Zeitgebers scheduling takes time and sudden environmental changes result in cellular rhythms being temporarily out of step with demands imposed by the environment (external desynchronisation). This phase shift is experienced as jet lag when we rapidly cross longitudes and it takes approximately 1 day to adapt to each hour time zone crossed. Clocks in different tissues adapt to disturbance at different rates, leading to internal desynchrony, like the individual instruments of an orchestra playing independently. The hormone melatonin appears to play a role in both external and internal synchronisation. Its secretion from the pineal gland is inhibited by bright light (detected by non-visual photosensitive retinal ganglion cells), hence circulating melatonin levels are very low during the day. Melatonin was previously thought to regulate the sleep/wake cycle, but its secretion follows a similar pattern in nocturnally active animals (i.e. increasing melatonin levels at the beginning of the dark period) and may be more accurately considered the "hormone of the dark".

### Reciprocal interaction between the suprachiasmatic nucleus and the immune system tunes down the inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide [^04974c8b]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2014). Low credibility.

Several studies have shown circadian variations in the response of the immune system suggesting a role of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Here we show that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration in the beginning of the active period induced more severe responses in temperature and cytokines than LPS given in the rest period. Moreover night administered LPS increased SCN basal neuronal activity indicating a direct influence of inflammation on the SCN. Bilateral lesions of the SCN resulted in an increased inflammatory response to LPS demonstrating that an interaction between the SCN and the immune system modulates the intensity of the inflammatory response.

### Surgical anatomy of the subcallosal artery: implications for transcranial and endoscopic endonasal surgery in the suprachiasmatic region [^7596e78c]. Operative Neurosurgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Suprachiasmatic subcallosal lesions may have an intimate relationship with the anterior communicating artery (AcomA); injury to AcomA branches can result in basal forebrain infarction and cognitive dysfunction.

Objective

To evaluate anatomic variations of the AcomA basal perforating branches, especially the subcallosal artery (ScA), for clinical implications when approaching the suprachiasmatic subcallosal region from endonasal and transcranial routes.

Methods

The origin, course, diameter, and branching pattern of the AcomA's perforating branches were studied in 33 specimens from transcranial and endonasal perspectives.

Results

The ScA was present in 79% of the specimens as a single dominant artery arising from the posterior/posterosuperior surface of the AcomA, along with hypothalamic arteries (55%), or as a single artery (24%). It coursed posteriorly towards the lamina terminalis region, curving superiorly to the subcallosal area. The ScA gave off many branches to provide the main blood supply to the subcallosal region. Importantly, it supplies the septal/subcallosal region bilaterally. The ScA can be found posterior, superior, or inferior to the AcomA when using a transylvian, interhemispheric, or endonasal approach, respectively. In specimens with no ScA (21%), the median callosal artery (MdCA) was the dominant artery arising from the AcomA. It followed an identical course to the ScA, providing supply to the same structures bilaterally, but its distal extension reached the body/splenium of the corpus callosum. The MdCA is a ScA variant.

Conclusion

The ScA is a unique vessel because it supplies the septal/subcallosal region bilaterally; preservation of this vessel during surgery is crucial for successful outcomes.

### Identification of the suprachiasmatic nucleus venous portal system in the mammalian brain [^b8a35de2]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

There is only one known portal system in the mammalian brain - that of the pituitary gland, first identified in 1933 by Popa and Fielding. Here we describe a second portal pathway in the mouse linking the capillary vessels of the brain's clock suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) to those of the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT), a circumventricular organ. The localized blood vessels of portal pathways enable small amounts of important secretions to reach their specialized targets in high concentrations without dilution in the general circulatory system. These brain clock portal vessels point to an entirely new route and targets for secreted SCN signals, and potentially restructures our understanding of brain communication pathways.

### The neurobiology of circadian rhythms [^a376b7f9]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

There is a growing recognition that the coordinated timing of behavioral, physiologic, and metabolic circadian rhythms is a requirement for a healthy body and mind. In mammals, the primary circadian oscillator is the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which is responsible for circadian coordination throughout the organism. Temporal homeostasis is recognized as a complex interplay between rhythmic clock gene expression in brain regions outside the SCN and in peripheral organs. Abnormalities in this intricate circadian orchestration may alter sleep patterns and contribute to the pathophysiology of affective disorders.

### Chronic inflammation affects the photic response of the suprachiasmatic nucleus [^9710860f]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2008). Low credibility.

Environmental light entrains activity of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the mammalian circadian pacemaker. Using Fos as marker of neuronal activation, we investigated whether chronic systemic endotoxin administration can alter SCN responsiveness to light after different time intervals. Mice were treated i.p. with lipopolysaccharide for 60 days, and exposed to photic stimulation 7 or 30 days later. Light-induced Fos immunosignal in the SCN was highly significantly decreased versus controls at 7 days, and returned to control levels at 30 days. The data show that SCN function is altered by chronic inflammation and that this effect is reversible over time.

### The functional and clinical significance of the 24-hour rhythm of circulating glucocorticoids [^98cb34b2]. Endocrine Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Adrenal glucocorticoids are major modulators of multiple functions, including energy metabolism, stress responses, immunity, and cognition. The endogenous secretion of glucocorticoids is normally characterized by a prominent and robust circadian (around 24 hours) oscillation, with a daily peak around the time of the habitual sleep-wake transition and minimal levels in the evening and early part of the night. It has long been recognized that this 24-hour rhythm partly reflects the activity of a master circadian pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. In the past decade, secondary circadian clocks based on the same molecular machinery as the central master pacemaker were found in other brain areas as well as in most peripheral tissues, including the adrenal glands. Evidence is rapidly accumulating to indicate that misalignment between central and peripheral clocks has a host of adverse effects. The robust rhythm in circulating glucocorticoid levels has been recognized as a major internal synchronizer of the circadian system. The present review examines the scientific foundation of these novel advances and their implications for health and disease prevention and treatment.

### Sleep, circadian rhythms, and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease [^6753a774]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Part II: circadian dysfunction in ad pathogenesis

Although accumulating evidence points to a strong relationship between the sleep–wake cycle and AD pathogenesis, it is important to consider the potential role of the circadian system in mediating some of the observed effects. In the next section, we will discuss how the circadian clock system regulates the sleep–wake cycle and many other aspects of physiology. Although the circadian clock and the sleep–wake cycle are intimately linked, the circadian system is an independent entity with unique therapeutic targets and considerations.

Circadian rhythms are critical to human health

Circadian rhythms, defined as oscillations with a period of 24 h, are a fundamental component of mammalian physiology. Nearly all terrestrial organisms have circadian clock systems that serve to coordinate physiology with external cues such as the light–dark cycle. The circadian oscillation of the sleep–wake cycle is just one of many circadian processes in the body, and it is directly controlled by the circadian clock in mice and humans. Systemic circadian rhythms, such as those observed in the sleep–wake cycle, hormone secretion, and blood pressure, are controlled by the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN signals via multiple mechanisms, including the autonomic nervous and hormone release, to synchronize cell-autonomous peripheral clocks throughout the body. The SCN controls circadian secretion of melatonin, the 'dark' hormone which promotes sleep onset, and SCN lesions lead to loss of circadian rhythms and an arrhythmic sleep–wake cycle in mice.

This study aimed to investigate whether suprachiasmatic nucleus dysfunction induced anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. First, we stereotaxically injected AAV1-hSyn-eGFP into the SCN to observe the neural projections. Moreover, we performed bilateral SCN lesions in C57BL/6 J mice and injected AAV2/5-hSyn-Cre-GFP adeno-associated virus into the SCN of Bmal1 flox/flox mice to construct circadian rhythm disorder model, and evaluated the anxiety- and depression-like behaviors of them using temperature monitoring and behavioral testing. Finally, we explored the effects of the clock protein genes and BDNF-TrkB pathway using molecular biology.

### Potential bidirectional communication between the liver and the central circadian clock in MASLD [^28a57a2d]. Npj Metabolic Health and Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Most aspects of physiology and behaviour fluctuate every 24 h in mammals. These circadian rhythms are orchestrated by an autonomous central clock located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei that coordinates the timing of cellular clocks in tissues throughout the body. The critical role of this circadian system is emphasized by increasing evidence associating disruption of circadian rhythms with diverse pathologies. Accordingly, mounting evidence suggests a bidirectional relationship where disruption of rhythms by circadian misalignment may contribute to liver diseases while liver diseases alter the central clock and circadian rhythms in other tissues. Therefore, liver pathophysiology may broadly impact the circadian system and may provide a mechanistic framework for understanding and targeting metabolic diseases and adjust metabolic setpoints.

### Circadian gene clock regulates psoriasis-like skin inflammation in mice [^12b006a7]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Psoriasis is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by increased proliferation, altered differentiation of the epidermis, and infiltration of inflammatory cells such as neutrophils into the dermis. Recent studies suggest that IL-23 has a critical role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis by inducing pathological T helper type 17 (Th17) cells that release IL-17 and IL-22. However, it is not fully understood how the IL-23 pathway in psoriasis is regulated.

The circadian clock is an essential timing system driving daily oscillations of behavior and physiology, such as sleep–wake cycles and hormonal secretions. The mammalian circadian clock system consists of the central oscillator, located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, and peripheral oscillators present in virtually all cell types including the skin. The central suprachiasmatic nucleus clock can receive light input from the retina that synchronizes internal clock timing to the external solar day, which it passes on to peripheral clocks via neural and endocrine pathways. The molecular mechanisms of rhythm generation are highly conserved in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and peripheral cells, and created and maintained by interlocked transcriptional–translational feedback loops. The core loop is driven by two activators (CLOCK and BMAL1) and two repressors (PERIOD (PER) and CRYPTOCHROME (CRY)). Briefly, CLOCK and BMAL1 heterodimerize and activate transcription of the Per1/2 and Cry1/2 genes, as well as other clock output genes, via the E-box (or E-box-like) elements in the promoter region of the genes. The PER and CRY proteins heterodimerize and, in turn, suppress CLOCK/BMAL1 activity, thereby inhibiting their own transcription.

### The roles of melatonin and light in the pathophysiology and treatment of circadian rhythm sleep disorders [^12d1db5d]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Normal circadian rhythms are synchronized to a regular 24 h environmental light-dark cycle, and the suprachiasmatic nucleus and the hormone melatonin have important roles in this process. Desynchronization of circadian rhythms, as occurs in chronobiological disorders, can produce severe disturbances in sleep patterns. According to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, circadian rhythm sleep disorders (CRSDs) include delayed sleep phase syndrome, advanced sleep phase syndrome, non-24 h sleep-wake disorder, jet lag and shift-work sleep disorder. Disturbances in the circadian phase position of plasma melatonin levels have been documented in all of these disorders. There is compelling evidence to implicate endogenous melatonin as an important mediator in CRSD pathophysiology, although further research involving large numbers of patients will be required to clarify whether the disruption of melatonin secretion is a causal factor in CRSDs. In this Review, we focus on the use of exogenous melatonin and light therapy to treat the disturbed sleep-wake rhythms seen in CRSDs.

### Pathophysiology of cluster headache: from the trigeminovascular system to the cerebral networks [^69bc79cb]. Cephalalgia (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite advances in neuroimaging and electrophysiology, cluster headache's pathogenesis remains unclear. This review will examine clinical neurophysiology studies, including electrophysiological and functional neuroimaging, to determine if they might help us construct a neurophysiological model of cluster headache.

Results

Clinical, biochemical, and electrophysiological research have implicated the trigeminal-parasympathetic system in cluster headache pain generation, although the order in which these two systems are activated, which may be somewhat independent, is unknown. Electrophysiology and neuroimaging have found one or more central factors that may cause seasonal and circadian attacks. The well-known posterior hypothalamus, with its primary circadian pacemaker suprachiasmatic nucleus, the brainstem monoaminergic systems, the midbrain, with an emphasis on the dopaminergic system, especially when cluster headache is chronic, and the descending pain control systems appear to be involved. Functional connection investigations have verified electrophysiological evidence of functional changes in distant brain regions connecting to wide cerebral networks other than pain.

Conclusion

We propose that under the impact of external time, an inherited misalignment between the primary circadian pacemaker suprachiasmatic nucleus and other secondary extra- suprachiasmatic nucleus clocks may promote disturbance of the body's internal physiological clock, lowering the threshold for bout recurrence.

### The development of circadian rhythms in the fetus and neonate [^02450a3a]. Seminars in Perinatology (2001). Low credibility.

The circadian time-keeping system is the neural system that allows predictive adaptation of individuals to the reproducible 24-hour day/night alternations of our planet. A biological clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, receives environmental information and imposes a circadian pattern to physiological functions. Since the suprachiasmatic nucleus develops early in gestation and circadian rhythms are present in the fetus and newborn, the circadian system seems to be functional in fetal life and can receive circadian inputs through the mother. The neonate moves to an environment in which the main time giving signal is the light:dark cycle. Teleologically, a term newborn should be fit to face this challenge. But this may be quite different for a preterm infant that trades the circadian environment to which it was previously exposed for the timeless environment of the Neonatal Intensive Care Nursery. Scientists and physicians should seek new experimental and clinical approaches to answer the challenging questions of perinatal chronomedicine.

### Circadian rhythms in resting metabolic rate account for apparent daily rhythms in the thermic effect of food [^b0cb4657]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Research in murine and human models highlights the importance of circadian rhythms in the regulation of energy metabolism, and the role of circadian disruption in poor health outcomes. The mammalian circadian system is composed of the central hypothalamic clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei and peripheral clocks found throughout the body. The suprachiasmatic nuclei receives photic input from the retina and relays temporal information throughout the brain and peripheral tissues. Both central and peripheral rhythms are evident in many key metabolic processes involved in the regulation of energy balance, occurring at the most basic cellular level, through to whole-body energy metabolism. Various hormones involved in energy metabolism display circadian oscillations, and circadian variations have been observed in human resting metabolic rate (RMR), peaking around 1700 to 1800 hours, and with a trough at approximately 0500 hours.

### Suprachiasmatic nucleus dysfunction induces anxiety-and depression-like behaviors via activating the BDNF-trkB pathway of the striatum [^21f82c82]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

The circadian rhythm system consists of a master clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus and peripheral clocks dispersed throughout other brain areas (including striatum, Str) as well as various tissues and organs. Circadian rhythm disturbance is a major risk factor and common comorbidity for mood disorders, especially anxiety and depression. Bmal1 is one of the fundamental clock protein genes that is required to maintain circadian rhythm. Recent research has revealed a link between suprachiasmatic nucleus dysfunction and anxiety and depression, but the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. This study aimed to investigate how circadian rhythm disturbance may lead to anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. Through behavioral tests, virus tracing, molecular biology and other techniques, we found neural connection from the suprachiasmatic nucleus to the striatum. SCN lesions and Bmal1 flox/flox +pAAV-hSyn-Cre-GFP (conditional knockout, cKO) mice exhibited disruptions in core body temperature rhythm, as well as anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. Importantly, these mice displayed altered expression patterns of clock protein genes and an upregulation of the Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) - Tyrosine Kinase receptor B (TrkB) signaling pathway within the striatum. Microinjection of the TrkB inhibitor ANA-12 can effectively reverse anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. These findings indicate that suprachiasmatic nucleus dysfunction may contribute to the pathogenesis of anxiety and depression through upregulation of the BDNF-TrkB pathway in the striatum, potentially mediated by neural projections from the SCN. Bmal1 gene within SCN may represent a novel therapeutic target for mood disorders.

### Transient short free running circadian rhythm in a case of aneurysm near the suprachiasmatic nuclei [^c13d6fd8]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

A free running circadian rest-activity cycle is rare in sighted individuals living in a normal environment. Even more rare is a periodicity shorter than 24 hours, as observed in actigraphic recordings in a female patient during convalescence after a whiplash injury in a car accident. The documented free running period was 22.5 hours for 19 days. During the subsequent weeks re-entrainment occurred following re-establishment by a social zeitgeber, with a slightly early circadian phase of nocturnal melatonin onset relative to a late sleep period. Magnetic resonance imaging and cerebral angiography showed an aneurysm at the bifurcation of the right internal carotid artery, close to the circadian pacemaker structure (the suprachiasmatic nuclei), which was later occluded.

### Suprachiasmatic nucleus dysfunction induces anxiety-and depression-like behaviors via activating the BDNF-trkB pathway of the striatum [^2a37bbfc]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Circadian rhythms significantly influence human mood fluctuations, as established in prior studies. This research elucidates how dysfunctions in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the master regulator of circadian rhythms, impact mood disorders such as anxiety and depression. Our findings highlight the critical role of the BDNF-TrkB pathway in the striatum, influenced by SCN dysfunction, in the manifestation of these disorders. In this study, we developed a mouse model with SCN lesions and observed disturbances in the 24-h circadian regulation of core body temperature, along with behaviors indicative of anxiety and depression. These alterations were accompanied by activation of neural connection from the SCN to the striatum, disruption in circadian clock genes expression, and upregulation of BDNF-TrkB pathway in the striatum. Moreover, we obtained similar results in a mouse model with conditional knockout of the Bmal1 gene in the SCN (cKO). These demonstrate the potential mechanism by which SCN dysfunction may contribute to occurrence of behaviors of anxiety and depression.

### The choroid plexus is an important circadian clock component [^e9a5e4ed]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Mammalian circadian clocks have a hierarchical organization, governed by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus. The brain itself contains multiple loci that maintain autonomous circadian rhythmicity, but the contribution of the non-SCN clocks to this hierarchy remains unclear. We examine circadian oscillations of clock gene expression in various brain loci and discovered that in mouse, robust, higher amplitude, relatively faster oscillations occur in the choroid plexus (CP) compared to the SCN. Our computational analysis and modeling show that the CP achieves these properties by synchronization of "twist" circadian oscillators via gap-junctional connections. Using an in vitro tissue coculture model and in vivo targeted deletion of the Bmal1 gene to silence the CP circadian clock, we demonstrate that the CP clock adjusts the SCN clock likely via circulation of cerebrospinal fluid, thus finely tuning behavioral circadian rhythms.

Brain Regions and Circuits Associated with Photoanalgesia

Retinal projections of rods and cones to the brain constitute imaging and nonimaging pathways. Images are formed primarily by activation of corn RGCs, and the functions of the nonimaging pathway are all mediated by a specialized pathway originating from ipRGCs, whose axons project via the optic nerve to the ventral suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), intergeniculate leaflet (IGL)/lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), and olivary pretectal nucleus (OPN). These brain regions, which may be involved in photoanalgesia, are introduced below (Figure 2).

Suprachiasmatic Nucleus

The suprachiasmatic nucleus is a compact, bilaterally paired cell group in the anterior–ventral hypothalamus. It was first identified as a hypothalamic retinal target in rodents, and by implication it was considered as a potential circadian control point following autoradiographic visualization of its dedicated route of retinal innervation — the retina hypothalamic tract. In mammals, it is the site of an endogenous pacemaker that regulates circadian rhythmicity and plays an indispensable role in behavioral, physiological, and hormonal rhythms in response to the environmental light–dark cycle. Suprachiasmatic nucleus also appears to function as a seasonal clock underlying the measurement of daylength. In summary, the SCN is the clock and calendar of vertebrates.

Suprachiasmatic nucleus participates in photoanalgesia probably by projecting to the pineal gland (PG), and the paraventricular nucleus (PVN).

### Changing the dosing schedule minimizes the disruptive effects of interferon on clock function [^43a8fad2]. Nature Medicine (2001). Excellent credibility.

The effectiveness and toxicity of many drugs vary depending on the relationship between the dosing schedule and the 24-hour rhythms of biochemical, physiological and behavioral processes. In addition, several drugs can cause alterations to the 24-hour rhythms leading to illness and altered homeostatic regulation. However, the mechanisms of this drug-based disruption of circadian 'clock' genes remain unclear. Here, we show the disruptive effect of interferon-alpha on the rhythm of locomotor activity, body temperature and clock-gene mRNA expression in the periphery and suprachiasmatic nuclei, a primary circadian pacemaker. The rhythmicity of clock genes and the photic induction of the Per gene in suprachiasmatic nuclei were disturbed by the repetitive administration of interferon-alpha. Moreover, alteration of clock function, a new concept of adverse effects, can be overcome by optimizing the dosing schedule to minimize adverse drug effects.

### ABM clinical protocol # 37: physiological infant care-managing nighttime breastfeeding in young infants [^6d35207f]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Normal infant sleep patterns and circadian development indicate that newborns are born without a functional circadian clock, and melatonin in maternal breast milk is passed to the infant in a circadian manner helping establish the infant's circadian rhythm. After 12 to 16 weeks, the infant will spend more time awake as the suprachiasmatic nucleus begins to establish a circadian rhythm, yet the longest sleep periods may not markedly lengthen between 3 and 12 months whether room sharing or sleeping solitarily; mothers may take daytime naps to compensate for nighttime sleep loss, although naps may not provide the same restorative value as nighttime sleep.

### Plasticity of circadian clocks and consequences for metabolism [^f35ef3e8]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

The increased prevalence of metabolic disorders and obesity in modern society, together with the widespread use of artificial light at night, have led researchers to investigate whether altered patterns of light exposure contribute to metabolic disorders. This article discusses the experimental evidence that perturbed environmental cycles induce rhythm disorders in the circadian system, thus leading to metabolic disorders. This notion is generally supported by animal studies. Distorted environmental cycles, including continuous exposure to light, affect the neuronal organization of the central circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), its waveform and amplitude of the rhythm in electrical activity. Moreover, repeated exposure to a shifted light cycle or the application of dim light at night are environmental cues that cause a change in SCN function. The effects on the SCN waveform are the result of changes in synchronization among the SCN's neuronal cell population, which lead consistently to metabolic disturbances. Furthermore, we discuss the effects of sleep deprivation and the time of feeding on metabolism, as these factors are associated with exposure to disturbed environmental cycles. Finally, we suggest that these experimental studies reveal a causal relationship between the rhythm disorders and the metabolic disorders observed in epidemiological studies performed in humans.

### About influenza | Influenza (flu) [^72272072]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Symptoms Flu can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. Flu symptoms usually come on suddenly. People who have flu often feel some or all of these signs and symptoms:

- fever or feeling feverish/chills
- cough
- sore throat
- runny or stuffy nose
- muscle or body aches
- headaches
- fatigue
- some people may have vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children than adults. It's important to note that not everyone with flu will have a fever. Not everyone with flu has symptoms Some people with influenza virus infections do not develop any symptoms at all. A household study conducted during the 2017–2023 flu seasons found that 8 percent of people who tested positive for flu did not have symptoms. Onset of Symptoms The time from when a person is exposed and infected with influenza virus to when symptoms begin is about two days but can range from about one to four days.

How it spreads Most experts believe that flu viruses spread mainly by tiny droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze, or talk. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby. Less often, a person might get flu by touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose or possibly their eyes. Testing and diagnosis It is very difficult to distinguish flu from other viral or bacterial respiratory illnesses based on symptoms alone. There are tests available to diagnose flu. Keep ReadingDiagnosis for Flu Treating Flu There are flu antiviral drugs that can be used to treat flu illness. Keep ReadingInformation for the Flu Season. Resources Flu A viruses can be broken down into sub-types depending on the genes that make up the surface proteins. Over the course of a flu season, different types and subtypes of flu circulate and cause illness.
- Types of Flu Viruses Flu A and B viruses are responsible for seasonal flu epidemics more commonly known as the flu season.
- How Flu Viruses Can Change Flu viruses can change in two different ways — antigenic drift and antigenic shift.
- Transmission of Flu Viruses from Animals to People Flu A viruses also are found in many different animals, including ducks, chickens, pigs, horses, whales, and seals.

### Suprachiasmatic translamina terminalis corridor used in endoscopic endonasal approach for resecting third ventricular craniopharyngioma [^a8579da2]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2015). Low credibility.

Object

The translamina terminalis corridor was used in the transcranial anterior route to treat third ventricular craniopharyngioma (TVC), which presents a challenge to neurosurgeons. The endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) has recently been used to treat craniopharyngiomas. However, there are few reports of the EEA being used to treat TVC. The authors' novel surgical approach of treating selected TVC by the endoscopic endonasal route via the suprachiasmatic translamina terminalis (STLT) corridor is described.

Methods

In this single-center study, the EEA via the STLT corridor was used to resect TVC with great upper and anterior extension causing bulged lamina terminalis, and TVC with a residual upper compartment, after routine infrachiasmatic transmetastalk corridor resection.

Results

The STLT corridor was used in 3 patients. Gross-total resection was achieved in all cases. One patient achieved visual improvement, and the other 2 patients showed partial visual improvement. Leakage of CSF occurred in 1 patient. Postoperative hormone replacement therapy was required in all patients.

Conclusions

The STLT corridor is a complementary minimally invasive corridor used in the EEA for treating selected TVC. The STLT alone or combined with infrachiasmatic transmetastalk corridors should be selected depending on the size of suprachiasmatic and infrachiasmatic space.

Dietary supplements — melatonin — is reported as common and physiologically tied to sleep regulation, as "Melatonin is another commonly cited dietary supplement in the NHIS in children", is "primarily produced by the pineal gland and is closely regulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which regulates the sleep-wake cycle", and "is used for functional sleep disorders to decrease sleep latency and in some children with neurodevelopmental disorders who have associated sleep disturbances". The page cautions that "Despite wide use, long-term studies on the safety and efficacy of pediatric melatonin use are lacking".

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^7db47d99]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Sleep disturbances in dementia — prevalence, contributors, and goals: Sleep problems have been reported in 25%–50% of patients with dementia, and provisional criteria for sleep disturbances associated with Alzheimer's disease have been proposed. Major causes include physiological changes associated with aging (fragmented nocturnal sleep, multiple and prolonged awakenings, relative decrease in slow-wave sleep percentage, and increased daytime napping), pathological involvement of the suprachiasmatic nucleus, co-occurring medical or psychiatric disorders or medications, untreated pain, and poor sleep hygiene. Cholinesterase inhibitors can also cause insomnia, and some over-the-counter sleep medications (e.g., diphenhydramine) can contribute to delirium and paradoxically worsen sleep, so it is important to ask about over-the-counter diphenhydramine or other over-the-counter or herbal preparations. Treatment aims are to decrease the frequency and severity of insomnia, interrupted sleep, and nocturnal confusion, increase patient comfort, decrease disruption to families and caregivers, and decrease nocturnal wandering and nighttime accidents. Available data do not support the recommendation of a specific course of action for treating sleep disturbances in patients with dementia.

### Antagonistic interplay between hypocretin and leptin in the lateral hypothalamus regulates stress responses [^254faf7a]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, there is an inverse correlation between the circadian rhythms of plasma leptin and HPA axis activity, which also correlates with the circadian regulation of Hcrt neuronal activity and Hcrt messenger RNA levels. Indeed, the link between circadian oscillation and Hcrt activity may be direct, as a recent report shows that Hcrt can suppress activity of suprachiasmatic nucleus neurons. However, it is unclear whether the firing rate of LHA LepRb neurons is subject to circadian and/or behavioural state control. Some LHA non-Hcrt/non-MCH GABAergic neurons show a state-dependent pattern of activity with maximal firing during sleep but these neurons also remain active during the wake state. Another population of non-Hcrt/non-MCH GABAergic neurons has been shown to fire in a non-state-dependent manner. Although plasma leptin exhibits a circadian profile, LepRb neurons in the LHA appear to be regulated in a different manner, independent of circadian control by the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Our results are consistent with the notion that a balance between the activity of Hcrt and leptin-sensitive neurons participates in the circadian regulation of HPA axis activity, but this hypothesis should be examined further with regard to the activity of LepRb neurons across the light–dark cycle in vivo and possible interactions downstream of the suprachiasmatic nucleus.

In summary, we describe a link between arousal, metabolism and stress responses at the cellular and circuit levels. Collectively, our study reveals an important role for Hcrt and leptin, acting through hypothalamic leptin-sensitive GABAergic neurons, and suggests that an imbalance between the activity of LepRb-expressing neurons and Hcrt neurons in the LHA could lead to disruptions in HPA axis activity, which may depend on behavioural context and energy balance.

### American diabetes association research symposium: diabetes and the brain [^7fc10b0a]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

The theme of hypothalamic/brain/periphery networking was further emphasized in the presentation by Joseph Bass, MD, PhD, from Northwestern University, that focused on circadian regulation of energy homeostasis. Dr. Bass reviewed the discovery of clock proteins in the 1990s, which set the stage for research on circadian function and its regulation in the subsequent years. In mammals, including humans, the CNS "master clock" has been identified as the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), and circadian rhythms are encoded by the sequential and reciprocal expression of transcription activators, CLOCK/BMAL1, that induce expression of the transcription repressors, PER1–3/CRY1–3, that inhibit CLOCK/BMAL1 expression. The cycle of expression takes approximately 24 h and is entrained by light. The SCN has connections with key homeostatic nuclei in the hypothalamus, including the arcuate, paraventricular nucleus, ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), lateral hypothalamus, and dorsal medial hypothalamus (DMH). Thus, there is direct input on behavior, activity, metabolism, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which in turn is a key diurnal regulator of activity and metabolism. Importantly, it is now appreciated that "clock proteins" are expressed in nearly all cells. Peripheral tissue clocks are entrained to food availability, adrenal glucocorticoids, and temperature, all of which can reset peripheral clocks. Although research is only beginning to uncover the complex crosstalk between stimuli and peripheral clocks, molecules that reflect metabolic status such as NAD and the nutrient sensor AMP kinase, relay information to the clocks and connectivity is bidirectional. A current line of investigation is examining the coupling of metabolic processes and CNS clock function. A high-fat diet in an animal model has been shown to increase period length of the daily activity rhythm and to phase-shift metabolic gene expression in the liver and adipose as well as in the hypothalamus. The CNS locus of this effect (SCN per se, or SCN projections) remains to be determined but clearly demonstrates metabolite/CNS clock interaction. Finally, sleep and activity abnormalities such as narcolepsy and genetic evidence in humans with altered sleep patterns suggest that pursuit of this research and links between clock activities and metabolic disease will reveal the importance of clock/environmental coordination to human metabolic health.

### A hypothalamic circuit for the circadian control of aggression [^b42a2f38]. Nature Neuroscience (2018). Medium credibility.

'Sundowning' in dementia and Alzheimer's disease is characterized by early-evening agitation and aggression. While such periodicity suggests a circadian origin, whether the circadian clock directly regulates aggressive behavior is unknown. We demonstrate that a daily rhythm in aggression propensity in male mice is gated by GABAergic subparaventricular zone (SPZ GABA) neurons, the major postsynaptic targets of the central circadian clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Optogenetic mapping revealed that SPZ GABA neurons receive input from vasoactive intestinal polypeptide suprachiasmatic nucleus neurons and innervate neurons in the ventrolateral part of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), which is known to regulate aggression. Additionally, VMH-projecting dorsal SPZ neurons are more active during early day than early night, and acute chemogenetic inhibition of SPZ GABA transmission phase-dependently increases aggression. Finally, SPZ GABA -recipient central VMH neurons directly innervate ventrolateral VMH neurons, and activation of this intra-VMH circuit drove attack behavior. Altogether, we reveal a functional polysynaptic circuit by which the suprachiasmatic nucleus clock regulates aggression.

### Practice parameter on gay, lesbian, or bisexual sexual orientation, gender nonconformity, and gender discordance in children and adolescents [^ff6fde3b]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2012). Medium credibility.

Biological influences on sexual orientation — neuroendocrine, genetic, and neuroanatomical findings are outlined. The neurohormonal theory posits that prenatal sex hormone levels influence development of gender role behavior in childhood and sexual orientation in adulthood, and neither homosexuality nor gender variance is an indication for endocrine, genetic, or any other special medical evaluation. Genetic studies report that, among gay adult males, 52% of monozygotic co-twins were homosexual, 22% of dizygotic co-twins and 11% of adoptive brothers were homosexual; among adult lesbians, 48% of monozygotic co-twins, 16% of dizygotic co-twins, and 6% of adoptive sisters were also lesbian, with the authors stating these data suggest a substantial heritable influence on sexual orientation. Limited evidence indicates correlations between sexual orientation and neuroanatomical features in males, including the third anterior interstitial nucleus of the hypothalamus (INAH-3) and the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), with further research needed to confirm significance.

### Paraventricular hypothalamus mediates diurnal rhythm of metabolism [^6dd2b818]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Through evolutionary adaptation to light–dark cycles, animals have developed diurnal rhythms in metabolism, feeding, and locomotion. As a typical nocturnal species, mice exhibit higher levels of energy expenditure, feeding, and locomotion during periods of dark, compared to light. Similarly, individual cells also exhibit diurnal expression patterns of functionally important genes. One such a group of genes are clock genes, which, through rhythmic regulation of numerous downstream targets, control the cyclical function of cells. Previous studies on circadian biology with a focus on diurnal patterns of locomotion have identified the clock gene expression in the superachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) as a major mechanism underlying light entrainment of diurnal patterns in both locomotion and clock gene expression –. Notably, mice with dysfunctional clock genes also exhibit defects in diurnal patterns in feeding and metabolism –, suggesting an important role for clock genes in mediating diurnal rhythms in metabolism, in addition to diurnal locomotion. Recent studies suggest that ageing and high-caloric diet (HFD)-induced obesity (DIO) is associated with diminished diurnal rhythms in metabolism and feeding, and importantly, scheduled feeding, i.e. limiting feeding only within dark periods, greatly improves metabolism despite similar energy intake. Together, these findings reveal a critical function for clock gene-related diurnal rhythms in metabolism and health. However, despite extensive studies on circadian biology, the neural basis governing diurnal patterns in metabolism remains elusive.

Schematic overview of the nuclei within the human hypothalamus, the satiety hormones, and its connection to the pituitary gland. The hypothalamic nuclei are interconnected through neural pathways; the connection between the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN) is highlighted. Hypothalamic-releasing hormones (including thyrotropin-releasing hormone [TRH], corticotropin-releasing hormone [CRH], gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH], and growth hormone–releasing hormone [GHRH]) are released into efferent blood vessels and stimulate the anterior pituitary gland to produce thyrotropin (TSH), adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), luteinizing hormone (LH)/follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and growth hormone (GH), respectively. Hunger and satiety hormones (such as ghrelin, leptin, insulin, and glucagon-like peptide-1 [GLP1]) stimulate the so-called orexigenic and anorexigenic responses, respectively, in hypothalamic neurons through afferent blood vessels. ADH, antidiuretic hormone; AgRP, agouti-related peptide; CCK, cholecystokinin; NPY, neuropeptide Y; POMC, pro-opiomelanocortin; PYY, polypeptide-Y.

### Sudden bilateral vision loss due to third ventricular cavernous angioma with intratumoral hemorrhage-case report [^ccaf9143]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Cavernous angioma (CA) of the central nervous system accounts for 8 to 15% of cerebrovascular malformations in postmortem studies. Third ventricle cavernous angioma is a most unusual variant of CA, with only 39 cases in the literature. According to this review, these patients presented at a median age of 38 years and the most common symptom was headaches (26 patients; 66.7%). Of these patients, 24 were female (61.5%) and 15 were male (38.5%). In terms of specific location within the third ventricle, 18 patients (46.2%) had CA at the Foramen of Monro (FoM), 7 (17.9%) had CA in the lateral wall of the third ventricle, 3 (7.7%) had CA in the floor of the third ventricle, 3 (7.7%) had CA in the suprachiasmatic region, 5 (12.8%) had CA in the pineal region/posterior third ventricle, and 3 (7.7%) had CA at an unspecified location.

CAs located at the FoM were the most likely to cause hydrocephalus (83.3%) followed by CAs located at the pineal region/posterior third ventricle (80%). On the other hand, CAs located in the suprachiasmatic region were most likely to cause endocrine dysfunction (33%), because of the close to the hypothalamus. Visual disturbances were also seen in CAs located in the suprachiasmatic region (100%).

Our patient also developed headaches and presented increasing TSH. As mentioned, suprachiasmatic CAs sometimes cause endocrine dysfunction, because they are closed to hypothalamus which controls the pituitary gland. Further, the hemorrhage in the CA had compressed the chiasm and caused sudden bilateral vision loss in this case. The hemorrhage was absorbed, which may explain the spontaneous improvement in visual function before the surgery. A important issue with CAs is their potential to bleed. CA may have an autosomal dominant inheritance, and not all lesions require surgery. However, surgery is advocated for those with severe vision loss or recurrent hemorrhage.

### Amygdala and hypothalamus: historical overview with focus on aggression [^d3a30ff2]. Neurosurgery (2019). Medium credibility.

HYPOTHALAMUS

The hypothalamus is a small diencephalic structure located under the thalamus. It lies on the wall and floor of the third ventricle, extends a few millimeters laterally, and is positioned above the optic chiasm anteriorly and adjacent to the mammillary bodies posteriorly. It is composed of several distinct nuclei with widespread connections throughout the nervous system. The hypothalamus is largely known for its role in controlling homeostasis and motivated behaviors.

Based on nuclear landmarks, the hypothalamus can be divided into 3 areas along its rostro-caudal axis: anterior, medial, and posterior. Alternatively, based on the anatomical localization of cells projecting to the pituitary gland, it can be subdivided along its medial-lateral axis into periventricular, medial, and lateral areas. The anterior region is primarily responsible for producing oxytocin and vasopressin and for controlling the circadian cycle; the medial region is associated with producing hypothalamic-releasing hormones and controlling numerous motivated behaviors; and the posterior region is involved in thermoregulation, memory, and emotions. Figure 4 shows the main hypothalamic connections based on functions.

### Chapter 6: influenza… [^73468c49]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Disease Description Influenza is an acute respiratory disease caused by infection with influenza viruses. The incubation period ranges from 1 to 4 days. Peak virus shedding usually occurs from 1 day before onset of symptoms to 3 days after. Typical features of influenza include abrupt onset of fever and respiratory symptoms such as cough, sore throat, and coryza, as well as systemic symptoms such as headache, muscle aches, and fatigue. Influenza A and B viruses both undergo gradual, continuous change in the HA and NA proteins, known as antigenic drift. As a result of these antigenic changes, antibodies produced to influenza viruses as a result of infection or vaccination with earlier strains may not be protective against viruses circulating in later years. Consequently, yearly epidemics usually occur in populations, and multiple infections can occur over a person's lifetime.

The majority of recently circulating influenza viruses are susceptible to the neuraminidase inhibitor antiviral medications, oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir; however, rare sporadic instances of resistant viruses have been detected worldwide. It is also possible that some influenza viruses become resistant to oseltamivir and peramivir during antiviral treatment with 1 of these agents and remain susceptible to zanamivir; this has been reported most often for influenza A viruses. [. Knowledge of the prevalent circulating virus type/subtype can also assist healthcare providers in making treatment decisions. For example, if influenza activity has been confirmed in a community, antiviral drugs may be used to treat patients with ILI within 48 hours of onset of symptoms to reduce the length and severity of illness.

With the increased use of antiviral drugs, virologic surveillance also is important to determine the level of drug-resistance among circulating influenza viruses. Finally, disease surveillance allows for identification of high-risk persons, determination of the effectiveness of current prevention strategies, and refinement of vaccine and antiviral recommendations each year. Case Definitions Definitive diagnosis of influenza requires laboratory confirmation in addition to signs and symptoms. Case definitions for influenza-like illness are nonspecific for influenza and vary depending on the purpose for which they are used. A case definition of fever 100°F or greater, oral or equivalent, and cough and/or sore throat is used by CDC in its U. S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network, in which healthcare providers report the total number of patient visits and the number of patients seen for ILI each week.

### Hypothalamic subunit volumes in schizophrenia and bipolar spectrum disorders [^bea5dde9]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2024). Medium credibility.

Morphological deficits in the hypothalamus have been reported in severe mental disorders, including in schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SCZ) and bipolar spectrum disorder (BPD). However, previous neuroimaging studies of total hypothalamus volumes in SCZ and BPD have yielded conflicting results, where most studies have relied on small samples. In SCZ studies both largerand smallervolumes compared to healthy controls have been reported, whereas other studies have reported no differences. In BPD, larger total hypothalamus volume in patients compared to healthy controls has been reported; however, this contrasts with findings of smaller volumes from postmortem studies.

Within the hypothalamus, individual nuclei exert different endocrine and autonomic functions. The main nuclei are the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), ventromedial nucleus (VMN); paraventricular nucleus (PVN), preoptic nucleus, supraoptic nucleus (SON), arcuate nucleus (ARC), and the mammillary bodies. The SCN, regulates the circadian rhythm and sleep; both processes which are disrupted in SCZ and BPD disorders. The VMN is important for the regulation of female sexual behavior, satiety and caloric intake, energy balance, and cardiovascular rhythm. Metabolic abnormalities have been observed among individuals with SCZ. Production of the peptides oxytocin and vasopressin occurs in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei (SON). Oxytocin plays a critical role in social cognition and several studies have examined the potential clinical benefits of oxytocin for improvement of psychopathology in SCZ. The preoptic nucleus is involved in the regulation of sleep, body temperature, and modulates food intake in response to temperature change. The ARC is an important site for the integration of peripheral signals with other sensory information and for the syntheses of dopamine and growth-releasing hormone, as well as for relaying leptin signals to other parts of the hypothalamus. Dopamine is a modulatory neurotransmitter involved in the pathology of SCZ, and in the control of prolactin release from the anterior pituitary. Disrupted homoeostasis between the dopamine transporter and dopamine receptors has also been reported in depressive phases of BPD. Mammillary bodies are part of the Papez Circuit, and are involved in memory recollection, including spatial and episodic memory consolidation. Impaired memory recollection constitutes a potential cognitive endophenotype in SCZand in subsyndromal individuals with BPD.

### Locked nucleic acid-based in situ hybridisation reveals miR-7a as a hypothalamus-enriched microRNA with a distinct expression pattern [^9e5a2030]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2012). Low credibility.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short (∼22 nucleotides) noncoding RNA molecules that post-transcriptionally repress the expression of protein-coding genes by binding to 3'-untranslated regions of the target mRNAs. To identify miRNAs selectively expressed within the hypothalamus, a part of the brain that controls vital bodily functions, we employed locked nucleic acid (LNA)-fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH). The expression pattern of the mature miRNAs miR-7a, miR-7b, miR-137 and miR-153 in mouse brain tissue sections was investigated. Although all studied miRNAs were present in the hypothalamus, miR-7a, was the only miRNA found to be enriched in the hypothalamus, with low or no expression in other parts of the central nervous system (CNS). Within the hypothalamus, strong miR-7a expression was distinct and restricted to some hypothalamic nuclei and adjacent areas. miR-7a expression was particularly prominent in the subfornical organ, as well as the suprachiasmatic, paraventricular, periventricular, supraoptic, dorsomedial and arcuate nuclei. Identical expression patterns for miR-7a were seen in mouse and rat hypothalamus. By combining LNA-FISH with immunohistochemistry, it was shown that miR-7a was preferentially present in small orexigenic neuropeptide Y/agouti-related protein-containing-neurones located in the ventromedial aspect of the arcuate nucleus but not in large pro-opiomelanocortin/cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript-containing anorexigenic neurones of the ventrolateral part of the arcuate nucleus. The limited and distinct expression of miR-7a in the CNS suggests that miR-7a has a role in post-transcriptional regulation in hypothalamic neurones. Particularly strong expression of miR-7a in neurones located in the ventromedial division of the arcuate nucleus, a subregion with a weak blood-brain barrier, raises the possibility that miR-7a is influenced by circulating hormones and is a regulator of the genes involved in body weight control.

1 THE ADULT HYPOTHALAMUS: FUNCTION AND ORGANISATION

The hypothalamus is an evolutionarily‐ancient part of the ventral forebrain. Its overall organisation and resident cell types have been highly conserved in eukaryotes, 1 reflecting the crucial role of the hypothalamus to life. It is the central autonomic regulator of homeostatic mechanisms, including energy balance, growth, stress regulation, sleep and reproduction. It integrates numerous inputs, including those from sensory afferents and circulating peripheral systems, compares these with ideal basic set‐points for features such as hormone and metabolite levels, temperature and electrolyte balance, and then initiates feedback systems to restore optimal physiology. In addition, the hypothalamus mediates allostasis, that is, the ability to re‐evaluate optimal set‐points to anticipate the organism's changing environment. The adaptive responses of homeostasis and allostasis operate through autonomic, endocrine and behavioural systems and over different durations of time to maximise the chance of individual and species survival. In this way, hypothalamic cells enable the body to respond, anticipate and adapt to changing physiological conditions over life.

Classically, the adult hypothalamus is divided into four domains: pre‐optic, anterior, tuberal and mammillary. Each domain harbours cell clusters, termed nuclei, and less well‐defined territories, all arranged in a patchwork manner. Early reports, based on lesion studies, led to the idea that a particular nucleus, or territory, might centrally control a particular behaviour; however, sophisticated new approaches, including cell‐specific and conditional knockouts, chemogenetic and optogenetic studies, now suggest that activation of a particular neurone increases the likelihood of an event or a behaviour, such that homeostasis of a particular physiological state is mediated by complex interactions of multiple nuclei/neurones. 2

### Normal physiology of hypothalamic pituitary regulation [^f43ceb51]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

The anterior pituitary is a complex heterogeneous gland that exerts a central role in the integration of several regulatory systems. Its six key hormones affect peripheral glands or target tissues and are essential for reproduction, growth and development, metabolism, adaptation to external environmental changes, and stress. Each of the pituitary hormones is regulated by the central nervous system through neuroendocrine pathways involving the hypothalamus, by feedback effects from peripheral target gland hormones, and by intrapituitary mechanisms. The hormones are secreted in a pulsatile manner, which is distinct for each hormone and reflects the influence of its individual neuroendocrine control mechanisms.

### Nuclei-specific hypothalamus networks predict a dimensional marker of stress in humans [^ddcd6d0b]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Characterising hypothalamus networks predictive of stress

The network between hypothalamus nuclei and a priori subcortical ROIs included here contains less than 2% of all brain ordinates (1.38%: 1262 of 91,282) and 0.0015% of all edges (105 edges of 91,282 × 91,282). Nevertheless, we were able to generate significant out-of-sample stress predictions. Figure 3B already suggested that specific edges of the network may be especially relevant for stress. Thus, in our next step, we tested whether an even smaller network might improve stress predictions.

To carry out this test, we iteratively added one edge at a time, from 1 to 105, based on their order of importance (absolute regression coefficient) in the training group. As before, we then applied training weights to the functional connectivity of the test group to compute out-of-sample stress predictions, only this time predictions were based on a smaller number of edges (Fig. 4A). Neighbouring predictions only differ by the inclusion of one additional edge, so rather than establishing statistical significance at each step (amounting to a total of 105 tests), we used this analysis to identify the smallest significant network and the overall best prediction, as established in prior work (see Methods and ref.).

### Nuclei-specific hypothalamus networks predict a dimensional marker of stress in humans [^34d046c5]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Having established that our data provide reliable markers of resting-state coupling, we next sought to identify putative subnuclei within the hypothalamus. We performed hierarchical clustering using our previously established procedure. We computed a similarity matrix that summarises, for all pairs of hypothalamus voxels, the similarity of their absolute functional connectivity pattern with all other brain ordinates. Thus, if two hypothalamus voxels share a similar connectivity profile to the rest of the brain, their similarity is large, and they are more likely to be assigned to the same cluster. Clustering of the similarity matrix was performed using the group average hypothalamus connectome and thus blind to any variability present across participants relevant for later analyses. Cluster solutions with increasing numbers of clusters from 2 to 14 were evaluated with reference to previous parcellations in terms of their anatomical plausibility and symmetry (Supplementary Fig. 2A; see Methods). Using these criteria, we chose a detailed and anatomically plausible parcellation that contained seven nuclei per hemisphere (Fig. 1B, C). It identified subdivisions between anterior and posterior as well as dorsal and ventral parts of the hypothalamus. However, it did not distinguish between medial and lateral hypothalamus nuclei, possibly because our 2 mm resolution was insufficient for separating clusters in the medial-lateral axis. Note that the clustering algorithm was not constrained to induce hemispheric symmetry, any aspect of cluster size, or spatial contiguity of the voxels assigned to a given cluster. Nevertheless, the clusters we obtained differed in size and were spatially contiguous and relatively symmetrical between hemispheres. Thus, these anatomically realistic features emerged naturally. Once again, at this point in the analysis, we checked to ensure that it was possible to replicate our results. We closely replicated the hypothalamus parcellation derived from the first 200 participants in two additional datasets (3 T: n = 200; 7 T: n = 98; Supplementary Fig. 3) but used the original parcellation throughout the manuscript.

Hypothalamic control of basal metabolism

As mentioned above, basal metabolism accounts for the largest proportion of total energy expenditure. Approximately 70% of the respiration rate in the basal state is mitochondrial ATP production, ~20% is a mitochondria process to counteract mitochondrial proton leakage, and ~10% is a nonmitochondrial process. Various factors are found to affect and determine resting energy expenditure, including body mass, age, sex, and the levels of several hormones, which have been primarily documented in human studies. The hypothalamus exerts its effect through humoral and neuronal mechanisms, and the sections below illustrate the relevant hypothalamic regulatory mechanisms of basal metabolism.

### An updated view of hypothalamic-vascular-pituitary unit function and plasticity [^2c6aa417]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2017). Medium credibility.

The discoveries of novel functional adaptations of the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary gland for physiological regulation have transformed our understanding of their interaction. The activity of a small proportion of hypothalamic neurons can control complex hormonal signalling, which is disconnected from a simple stimulus and the subsequent hormone secretion relationship and is dependent on physiological status. The interrelationship of the terminals of hypothalamic neurons and pituitary cells with the vasculature has an important role in determining the pattern of neurohormone exposure. Cells in the pituitary gland form networks with distinct organizational motifs that are related to the duration and pattern of output, and modifications of these networks occur in different physiological states, can persist after cessation of demand and result in enhanced function. Consequently, the hypothalamus and pituitary can no longer be considered as having a simple stratified relationship: with the vasculature they form a tripartite system, which must function in concert for appropriate hypothalamic regulation of physiological processes, such as reproduction. An improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying these regulatory features has implications for current and future therapies that correct defects in hypothalamic-pituitary axes. In addition, recapitulating proper network organization will be an important challenge for regenerative stem cell treatment.

4 BRAIN GLUCOSE‐SENSING REGIONS

It is now recognised that glucose‐sensing neurons are found within a number of areas of the brain as well as in the periphery. The most well studied of these brain regions is the hypothalamus where glucose‐responsive neurons have been identified in the VMH, arcuate, lateral hypothalamus, paraventricular hypothalamus and supraoptic nucleus. Glucose‐sensing neurons have also documented in brain regions involved in motivation and reward such as the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, paraventricular thalamus, hippocampus and pre‐frontal cortex, and in the hindbrain (e.g. nucleus tractus solitarius) which coordinates functions that are fundamental to survival. As glucose is the primary fuel for all cells, the cardinal feature of glucose‐responsive neurons (as we will discuss below) is their ability to detect changes in glucose and then use that information to produce the appropriate counterregulatory response. As this response involves physiological, symptomatic and behavioural elements it has to be co‐ordinated. Watts and Donovan, have argued that discrete populations of glucose‐responsive neurons are organised in a classical sensori‐motor integrative network encompassing peripheral, hindbrain and hypothalamic components. In this hierarchical system, the forebrain is able to modulate the 'reflex loops' that exist in the hindbrain. This model is yet to be proven, and there remains much about the nature and detailed arrangements of its components parts that are still unknown. It did, however, provide the theoretical basis for interventions designed to recover defective glucose sensing such as 'Dishabituation' as I will describe later.

### Nuclei-specific hypothalamus networks predict a dimensional marker of stress in humans [^b574fe68]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In summary, we examined whether a subcortical brain network is associated with stress scores in a large healthy human population. Rather than identifying an extensive network for maximal prediction accuracy, we focused on a small network centred on the hypothalamus which involved less than 2% of brain ordinates and 0.0015% of brain edges. We characterised hypothalamus connectivity at the scale of its individual subnuclei. Using this nucleus-specific functional connectivity, we were able to significantly predict stress scores in an independent cohort. Predictions were behaviourally specific, improved by nucleus level resolution (as opposed to whole hypothalamus level resolution) and were consistent with a large body of work in animal models. Future interventional studies should explore whether inducing changes in precise hypothalamus networks may alter an individual's experience of stress. Exploring this in both healthy and clinical populations could have implications for treating a range of mental health disorders whose onset is often preceded by a prolonged experience of stress.

### Appetite-and weight-regulating neuroendocrine circuitry in hypothalamic obesity [^d6a137bf]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Hypothalamic Obesity: A Historical Perspective

Hypothalamic obesity (HyOb) has been defined loosely as a "syndrome of intractable weight gain after any hypothalamic damage". Despite only measuring about 0.7 cm 3 on either side of the third ventricle, the hypothalamus is a critical region of the brain responsible for regulating 7 endocrine axes via its intimate connections to the pituitary gland, as well as appetite, metabolism, thirst, circadian rhythms, arousal, temperature, memory, and behavior. Therefore, damage or maldevelopment of this area can have widespread consequences on a variety of homeostatic mechanisms and unsurprisingly cause, in addition to obesity and appetite dysregulation (classically hyperphagia), panhypopituitarism, sleep disturbances, temperature dysregulation, and behavioral disorders (often termed as the "hypothalamic syndrome" when present in combination). The dense congregation of neurons in this area, the poor definition of the various hypothalamic nuclei, and the limited resolution of current neuroradiological techniques, however, has meant that our current understanding of the circuitry underlying these clinical manifestations remains incompletely understood. Experiments manipulating the various hypothalamic genes involved also often result in effects on multiple neuronal subtypes or even lethality, further complicating the task of deciphering their role in the development of this region.

### Central diabetes insipidus secondary to COVID-19 infection: a case report [^6368f590]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

ADH is a nanopeptide, which is constructed in the magnocellular neurons of supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei in the hypothalamus. ADH is released into the general circulation via posterior hypophysis. Diabetes insipidus is usually caused due to degeneration of hypothalamic neurons. Brain trauma, surgery, primary or metastatic tumors, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, and genetic defects are recognized etiologies of these lesions. Nevertheless, many cases are considered to be idiopathic.

Previous research proposed that SARS-CoV-2 can involve the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. The SARS-CoV genome sequence was found in an autopsy study of the hypothalamus along with edematous and degenerated neurons. According to preliminary findings, tanycytes and median eminence capillaries, which are other parts of the highly permeable blood–brain barrier, express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine (TMPRSS) may enable SARS-CoV-2 viral entry into the hypothalamus. Another hypothesis is that SARS-CoV-2 could induce a delayed immune-mediated response, which may involve the central nervous system after the acute clinical phase of the disease.

Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea — primary drivers and energy thresholds: The guideline recognizes three main underlying causes of FHA — weight loss, vigorous exercise, and stress — and characterizes FHA by abnormalities in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion or dynamics. An energy deficit appears critical for weight loss– and exercise-induced FHA, with an acute energy availability threshold of 30 kcal/kg below which luteinizing hormone (LH) pulsatility is disrupted; experimental reductions of 470 and 810 kcal per day increased menstrual disturbance.

### Nuclei-specific hypothalamus networks predict a dimensional marker of stress in humans [^dad4ac2c]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Mental disorders present a huge global burden. Currently, treatments are typically chosen based on broad symptom-based diagnoses, rather than a mechanistic understanding of an individual's behavioural and brain changes. A growing body of work has therefore focused on analysing the brain changes that accompany, predict, or result from mental illness. Recently, in addition, this type of work has increasingly shifted towards a dimensional or transdiagnostic perspective. In line with this, we have shown that a dimensional approach that focuses on interpretable functions such as sleep problems or negative emotions, as opposed to broad classifications or classes of symptoms, aids the characterisation of the underlying brain networks.

Prolonged periods of stress are associated with several common psychiatric disorders including depression and anxiety. Yet, the brain changes that accompany stress are insufficiently understood. Stress can be defined as an actual or anticipated disruption of homoeostasis or an anticipated threat to well-being. Physiological and behavioural responses to acute stress are adaptive, spatially and temporally specific, and regulated by a distributed network of regions including the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus –. When these circuits trigger autonomic and endocrine stress responses, brainstem centres as well as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) are activated. Despite the various contributions made by this diverse set of regions, in this study, we focus on the hypothalamus. As part of the HPA axis, the hypothalamus is one of the key brain regions mediating the balance of hormones in response to acute stress –. For instance, the hypothalamus can directly activate the anterior pituitary and, via the adrenal cortex, trigger the release of cortisol. However, when stress turns into a prolonged state, it becomes maladaptive – and is frequently associated with compromised well-being. Currently, it remains unclear how human hypothalamus networks are affected by stress, in particular prolonged periods of stress. This might partly be because it is challenging to study the hypothalamus in vivo in humans.

### Management of acquired hypothalamic dysfunction and the hypothalamic syndrome; It is more than obesity [^b44049cf]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypothalamus and Its Functions

The hypothalamus is a small, ancient neuroendocrine organ in the brain that contains several nuclei responsible for regulating the body's balance (Fig. 1). The hypothalamus may be regarded as a "control center" with outputs to the pituitary gland (hormones), to the autonomic nervous system, and to other areas in the brain such as the frontal lobe, through its connective circuits (behavior). Hypothalamic dysfunction leads to (morbid) obesity or cachexia, but may have many more clinical consequences such as hypopituitarism, adipsia, disruption of the circadian rhythm, decreased energy expenditure, disturbed regulation of core body temperature, and behavioral changes (Fig. 2). Many patients with hypothalamic dysfunction experience chronic fatigue, increased daytime sleepiness, headaches, inactivity, and mood disorders, all of which may contribute to the development of obesity. Patients with hypothalamic dysfunction experience that their symptoms are not always adequately recognized or addressed, which may be due to the nonspecificity of its signs and symptoms as well as the rareness of hypothalamic dysfunction. Improvement of care is needed, to decrease the diagnostic delay of hypothalamic dysfunction as well as to improve the consequences of hypothalamic dysfunction such as (morbid) obesity and (chronic) fatigue. Adipsic arginine vasopressin (AVP) deficiency, severe hypothermia and/or hyperthermia, uncontrollable hyperphagia and severe mood disorders may require 24/7 management.

Parcellation of the hypothalamus

Hierarchical clustering (function nets_hierarchy.m part of FSLnets) was then performed on the similarity matrix. As hierarchical clustering is an agglomerative approach related to similarity values, voxels with similar connectivity profiles should end up in the same cluster, while voxels with different connectivity profiles should end up in separate clusters. We chose the most anatomically plausible parcellation by comparing each higher-order clustering step with the previous clustering step (see Supplementary Fig. 2) and by comparing the location and size of the clusters obtained at increasing levels of depths to known anatomical subdivisions of the hypothalamus. In other words, while the clustering itself was fully automated, the depth of clustering at which we decided to stop was subjective and based on anatomical considerations. We expected reasonable symmetry across hemispheres and focused on identifying divisions between anterior-posterior and medial-lateral clusters within the hypothalamus. We therefore stopped at the clustering depth where these criteria started to break down. To evaluate the quality of the clustering, we compared clusters with existing post-mortem images, and MRI work, as well as with atlases, to identify similarities in their anatomy. Supplementary Fig. 9 and Supplementary Table 3 summarise similarities and differences between our and other existing parcellations.

### Neurodevelopmental programming of adiposity: contributions to obesity risk [^a6d02cde]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Mechanisms Mediating the Developmental Programming of Adiposity

Hypothalamic Development

The arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARH) is adjacent to the third ventricle and median eminence, a circumventricular organ, all located within the mediobasal hypothalamus with a "permissive" blood–brain barrier access. The 2 best characterized populations of leptin-responsive neurons — POMC and neuropeptide Y (NPY)/agouti-related protein (AgRP) — reside in the ARH and are therefore well positioned to relay circulating peripheral signals of energy homeostasis to other parts of the hypothalamus and CNS. Hypothalamic cells and circuits are sensitive to the impact of obesity and HFD-feeding during development. In rodent models, these effects are conveyed in part by circulating molecules such as leptin, insulin, ghrelin, and amylin. Perturbations in the concentrations of these molecules affect neurogenesis of feeding-critical neurons generated during gestation, axonal outgrowth of neurons participating in feeding circuits during early postnatal period, and/or epigenetic modifications to genes involved in energy homeostasis. The pathways predicted to be primarily affected by such perinatal programming are those critical in energy homeostasis, such as those involving leptin- and insulin-responsive POMC and AgRP neurons.

### Neuropathological spectrum of anti-IgLON5 disease and stages of brainstem tau pathology: updated neuropathological research criteria of the disease-related tauopathy [^f091c325]. Acta Neuropathologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Due to the consistent involvement of the brainstem and the hypothalamus as observed in the pathology burden map, we suggest that the neuropathological assessment could be performed in a minimal set of brain regions that represent the "high interest areas" of the disease. These areas partly overlap with other samplings protocols, e.g. as suggested for PSP and should be easily applicable by other investigators. They should include at least the perirolandic region, striatum and/or lenticular nucleus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, midbrain, pons, medulla oblongata, and cerebellum. If a broad sampling is locally possible, it should include further brain regions (see " Materials and methods "), and the spinal cord.

### Hypothalamic obesity: from basic mechanisms to clinical perspectives [^aa4a000c]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Despite the diverse nature of obesity, there is compelling genetic, clinical, and experimental evidence that endorses the important contribution of brain circuits to this condition. The hypothalamus contains major regulatory circuits for bodyweight homoeostasis, the deregulation of which can lead to obesity. Although functional perturbation of hypothalamic pathways could lie at the basis of common forms of obesity, the term hypothalamic obesity has been created to define those rare forms of severe obesity where a clear hypothalamic substrate can be identified, either of genetic or acquired origin. An in-depth understanding of the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and therapeutic targets of hypothalamic obesity relies on the comprehension of the physiological basis of hypothalamic pathways governing bodyweight control, the mechanisms (either genetic or acquired) whereby they are perturbed, and the consequences of such perturbation. In this Review, we provide a synoptic overview of hypothalamic obesity, from basic mechanisms to clinical perspectives, with a major focus on current developments and new avenues for the diagnosis and precise treatment of these rare forms of obesity.

### Hypothalamic neuronal cellular and subcellular abnormalities in experimental obesity [^4b21cbbb]. International Journal of Obesity (2019). Medium credibility.

The characterization of the hypothalamic neuronal network, that controls food intake and energy expenditure, has provided great advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of obesity. Most of the advances in this field were obtained thanks to the development of a number of genetic and nongenetic animal models that, at least in part, overtook the anatomical constraints that impair the study of the human hypothalamus. Despite the undisputed differences between human and rodent physiology, most seminal studies undertaken in rodents that have unveiled details of the neural regulation of energy homeostasis were eventually confirmed in humans; thus, placing experimental studies in the forefront of obesity research. During the last 15 years, researchers have provided extensive experimental proof that supports the existence of hypothalamic dysfunction, which leads to a progressive whole-body positive energy balance, and thus, to obesity. Here, we review the experimental work that unveiled the mechanisms behind hypothalamic dysfunction in obesity.

### Migraine and the hypothalamus [^c7695fa4]. Cephalalgia (2009). Low credibility.

Migraine is a complex brain disorder where several neuronal pathways and neurotransmitters are involved in the pathophysiology. To search for a specific anatomical or physiological defect in migraine may be futile, but the hypothalamus, with its widespread connections with other parts of the central nervous system and its paramount control of the hypophysis and the autonomic nervous system, is a suspected locus in quo. Several lines of evidence support involvement of this small brain structure in migraine. However, whether it plays a major or minor role is unclear. The most convincing support for a pivotal role so far is the activation of the hypothalamus shown by positron emission tomography (PET) scanning during spontaneous migraine attacks. A well-known theory is that the joint effect of several triggers may cause temporary hypothalamic dysfunction, resulting in a migraine attack. If PET scanning had consistently confirmed hypothalamic activation prior to migraine headache, this hypothesis would have been supported. However, such evidence has not been provided, and the role of the hypothalamus in migraine remains puzzling. This review summarizes and discusses some of the clues.

### Neuronal regulation of energy homeostasis: beyond the hypothalamus and feeding [^7a52178e]. Cell Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

The essential role of the brain in maintaining energy homeostasis has motivated the drive to define the neural circuitry that integrates external and internal stimuli to enact appropriate and consequential metabolic and behavioral responses. The hypothalamus has received significant attention in this regard given its ability to influence feeding behavior, yet organisms rely on a much broader diversity and distribution of neuronal networks to regulate both energy intake and expenditure. Because energy balance is a fundamental determinant of survival and success of an organism, it is not surprising that emerging data connect circuits controlling feeding and energy balance with higher brain functions and degenerative processes. In this review, we will highlight both classically defined and emerging aspects of brain control of energy homeostasis.

### Neuroendocrine control of appetite and metabolism [^584a0135]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Body homeostasis is predominantly controlled by hormones secreted by endocrine organs. The central nervous system contains several important endocrine structures, including the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Conventionally, neurohormones released by the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland (hypophysis) have received much attention owing to the unique functions of the end hormones released by their target peripheral organs (e.g. glucocorticoids released by the adrenal glands). Recent advances in mouse genetics have revealed several important metabolic functions of hypothalamic neurohormone-expressing cells, many of which are not readily explained by the action of the corresponding classical downstream hormones. Notably, the newly identified functions are better explained by the action of conventional neurotransmitters (e.g. glutamate and GABA) that constitute a neuronal circuit. In this review, we discuss the regulation of appetite and metabolism by hypothalamic neurohormone-expressing cells, with a focus on the distinct contributions of neurohormones and neurotransmitters released by these neurons.

### Clinical overview… [^7f7e6190]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Symptoms and Illnesses The incubation period, the time from getting infected with HPIV to onset of symptoms, is generally 2 to 6 days. HPIV-1and HPIV-2are most often associated with croup, with HPIV-1 most often identified as the cause in children. Both can also cause upper and lower respiratory illness, and cold-like symptoms. HPIV-3is more often associated with bronchiolitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia. HPIV-4is recognized less often but may cause mild to severe respiratory tract illnesses. Upper respiratory illness from any HPIV is generally common cold symptoms. Signs and symptoms may include:

- fever
- runny nose
- cough
- sneezing
- **sore throat Other symptoms of HPIV illness may include**:
- ear pain
- irritability
- decreased appetite HPIVs can also cause more serious illness. Clinical syndromes in children include:

- croup, windpipe and sometimes into the bronchial tubes
- bronchitis
- bronchiolitis.
- **pneumonia Symptoms of more serious illness may include**:
- barking cough
- hoarseness
- stridor
- wheezing In adults, upper respiratory infections and bronchitis are the most common illnesses caused by HPIVs; signs and symptoms may include fever, runny nose, cough, and sore throat. Pneumonia may occur, especially in older adults and people with weakened immune systems. Reinfection People can get multiple HPIV infections in their lifetime. These reinfections usually cause mild upper respiratory tract illness with cold-like symptoms.

However, reinfections can cause serious lower respiratory tract illness, such as pneumonia, bronchitis, and bronchiolitis in some people. Older adults and people with weakened immune systems have a higher risk for severe infections. Most children 5 years of age and older have antibodies against HPIV-3 and approximately 75% have antibodies against HPIV-1 and HPIV-2.
