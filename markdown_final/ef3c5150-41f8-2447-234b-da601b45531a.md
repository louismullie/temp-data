## Question

10th Chinese 1995 Problem B1 Four solid balls radii 3, 3, 2, 2 touch each other. What is the radius of the solid ball which touches all four balls?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the radius of a solid ball that touches four given solid balls with radii 3, 3, 2, and 2, which are already mutually tangent. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the geometric configuration and whether the four given balls are arranged tetrahedrally. Then, I should verify the algebraic setup using Descartes' Theorem for mutually tangent spheres. Next, I will solve the resulting quadratic equation for the curvature of the fifth sphere and interpret both roots. Finally, I will convert curvature back to radius and double-check the arithmetic and geometric meaning of each solution.

> Let me first confirm the configuration. When four spheres are mutually tangent in 3D, they typically occupy the vertices of a tetrahedron, and there exist two spheres tangent to all four: one enclosing them (externally tangent) and one nestled in the void among them (internally tangent). This is the standard setup for Descartes' Theorem in three dimensions, which relates the curvatures of mutually tangent spheres [^notfound].

> I need to check the algebraic framework. Descartes' Theorem in 3D states that for five mutually tangent spheres with curvatures k_i = 1/r_i, the curvatures satisfy (k_1 + k_2 + k_3 + k_4 + k_5)^2 = 3(k_1^2 + k_2^2 + k_3^2 + k_4^2 + k_5^2). Here, the given curvatures are k_1 = 1/3, k_2 = 1/3, k_3 = 1/2, and k_4 = 1/2, and I need to solve for k_5, the curvature of the fifth sphere [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the equation setup before proceeding. Plugging the known curvatures into Descartes' Theorem gives (1/3 + 1/3 + 1/2 + 1/2 + k_5)^2 = 3[(1/3)^2 + (1/3)^2 + (1/2)^2 + (1/2)^2 + k_5^2]. Simplifying the left side, the sum inside the square is 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 2/3 + 1 = 5/3, so the left side becomes (5/3 + k_5)^2. The right side is 3[1/9 + 1/9 + 1/4 + 1/4 + k_5^2] = 3[2/9 + 1/2 + k_5^2] = 3[4/18 + 9/18 + k_5^2] = 3[13/18 + k_5^2] = 13/6 + 3k_5^2. Thus, the equation is (5/3 + k_5)^2 = 13/6 + 3k_5^2 [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify the expansion and rearrangement. Expanding the left side gives 25/9 + 10k_5/3 + k_5^2, so 25/9 + 10k_5/3 + k_5^2 = 13/6 + 3k_5^2. Bringing all terms to one side yields 25/9 − 13/6 + 10k_5/3 + k_5^2 − 3k_5^2 = 0, which simplifies to 25/9 − 13/6 + 10k_5/3 − 2k_5^2 = 0. Converting to a common denominator, 25/9 − 13/6 = 50/18 − 39/18 = 11/18, so the equation is −2k_5^2 + 10k_5/3 + 11/18 = 0, or equivalently 2k_5^2 − 10k_5/3 − 11/18 = 0 [^notfound].

> I will now examine the quadratic coefficients to ensure I'm using the quadratic formula correctly. The equation is 2k_5^2 − (10/3)k_5 − 11/18 = 0, so a = 2, b = −10/3, and c = −11/18. The discriminant is b^2 − 4ac = (−10/3)^2 − 4(2)(−11/18) = 100/9 + 88/18 = 100/9 + 44/9 = 144/9 = 16, which is a perfect square, so the roots are rational [^notfound].

> Let me calculate the roots carefully. Using the quadratic formula, k_5 = [10/3 ± √16] / (2·2) = [10/3 ± 4] / 4. This gives two solutions: k_5 = (10/3 + 4)/4 = (10/3 + 12/3)/4 = 22/3 / 4 = 22/12 = 11/6, and k_5 = (10/3 − 4)/4 = (10/3 − 12/3)/4 = (−2/3)/4 = −2/12 = −1/6 [^notfound].

> I should confirm the geometric interpretation of the signs. Positive curvature corresponds to a sphere externally tangent to the cluster, while negative curvature corresponds to a sphere internally tangent that encloses the void among the four spheres. Thus, k_5 = 11/6 gives the radius r = 1/k_5 = 6/11, and k_5 = −1/6 gives r = 1/|k_5| = 6, with the negative sign indicating internal tangency [^notfound].

> But wait, what if I misapplied the theorem or made an arithmetic slip? Let me double-check the smaller radius solution. If r = 6/11, then k = 11/6, and plugging back into the original equation: left side (5/3 + 11/6)^2 = (10/6 + 11/6)^2 = (21/6)^2 = (7/2)^2 = 49/4; right side 13/6 + 3(11/6)^2 = 13/6 + 3(121/36) = 13/6 + 363/36 = 78/36 + 363/36 = 441/36 = 49/4. The equality holds, so the smaller radius solution is correct [^notfound].

> I should also verify the larger radius solution. If r = 6, then k = −1/6, and the left side is (5/3 − 1/6)^2 = (10/6 − 1/6)^2 = (9/6)^2 = (3/2)^2 = 9/4; the right side is 13/6 + 3(−1/6)^2 = 13/6 + 3(1/36) = 13/6 + 1/12 = 26/12 + 1/12 = 27/12 = 9/4. Again, the equality holds, confirming the larger radius solution as well [^notfound].

> Final answer: There are two valid spheres tangent to all four given spheres. The smaller sphere has radius 6/11, and the larger sphere has radius 6. The problem does not specify which to choose, so both are mathematically correct; typically, the smaller internally tangent sphere is the intended answer in such geometry problems unless otherwise specified [^notfound].

---

The radius of the solid ball that touches all four given balls is **6/11**. This is found by treating the problem as a 3D extension of Descartes' Circle Theorem, where the curvatures (1/r) of mutually tangent spheres satisfy (k₁ + k₂ + k₃ + k₄ + k₅)² = 3(k₁² + k₂² + k₃² + k₄² + k₅²). With curvatures (1/3, 1/3, 1/2, 1/2) for the given balls, solving for the fifth curvature yields k₅ = 11/6, so the radius is r = 1/k₅ = 6/11.

---

## Geometric setup

We have four mutually tangent solid balls with radii 3, 3, 2, and 2. We seek the radius of a fifth ball that is tangent to all four. This is a 3D analog of the 2D Descartes' Circle Theorem, extended to spheres using **curvatures** (reciprocals of radii).

---

## Descartes' theorem for spheres

The 3D version states that for five mutually tangent spheres with curvatures (k_i = 1/r_i), the following holds:

(k₁ + k₂ + k₃ + k₄ + k₅)² = 3(k₁² + k₂² + k₃² + k₄² + k₅²)

---

## Applying the theorem

Given curvatures:

- (k_1 = 1/3)
- (k_2 = 1/3)
- (k_3 = 1/2)
- (k_4 = 1/2)

Let (k_5) be the curvature of the unknown sphere. Substitute into the theorem:

(1/3 + 1/3 + 1/2 + 1/2 + k₅)² = 3[(1/3)² + (1/3)² + (1/2)² + (1/2)² + k₅²]

Simplify the left side:

(2/3 + 1 + k₅)² = (5/3 + k₅)²

Simplify the right side:

3(1/9 + 1/9 + 1/4 + 1/4 + k₅²) = 3(2/9 + 1/2 + k₅²) = 3(13/18 + k₅²) = 13/6 + 3k₅²

So the equation becomes:

(5/3 + k₅)² = 13/6 + 3k₅²

---

## Solving for (k_5)

Expand the left side:

25/9 + (10/3)k₅ + k₅² = 13/6 + 3k₅²

Rearrange:

25/9 − 13/6 + (10/3)k₅ + k₅² − 3k₅² = 0

11/18 + (10/3)k₅ − 2k₅² = 0

Multiply by 18 to clear denominators:

11 + 60k₅ − 36k₅² = 0

Rearrange:

36k₅² − 60k₅ − 11 = 0

Solve the quadratic:

k₅ = [60 ± √(3600 + 1584)]/72 = [60 ± √5184]/72 = [60 ± 72]/72

This gives two solutions:

- k₅ = 132/72 = 11/6
- k₅ = −12/72 = −1/6

---

## Interpreting the solutions

Positive curvature corresponds to a sphere externally tangent to the cluster, while negative curvature corresponds to a sphere internally tangent (enclosing the cluster). The problem asks for the solid ball that touches all four, which is the **externally tangent sphere**, so we take the positive curvature.

---

## Final answer

The curvature is (k_5 = 11/6), so the radius is:

r = 1/k₅ = 6/11

---

The radius of the solid ball that touches all four given balls is **6/11**.

### Solid-body trajectoids shaped to roll along desired pathways [^14d17a08]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

In everyday life, rolling motion is typically associated with cylindrical (for example, car wheels) or spherical (for example, billiard balls) bodies tracing linear paths. However, mathematicians have, for decades, been interested in more exotically shaped solids such as the famous oloids 1, sphericons 2, polycons 3, platonicons 4 and two-circle rollers 5 that roll downhill in curvilinear paths (in contrast to cylinders or spheres) yet indefinitely (in contrast to cones, Supplementary Video 1). The trajectories traced by such bodies have been studied in detail 6–9, and can be useful in the context of efficient mixing 10,11 and robotics, for example, in magnetically actuated, millimetre-sized sphericon-shaped robots 12,13, or larger sphericon- and oloid-shaped robots translocating by shifting their centre of mass 14,15. However, the rolling paths of these shapes are all sinusoid-like and their diversity ends there. Accordingly, we were intrigued whether a more general problem is solvable: given an infinite periodic trajectory, find the shape that would trace this trajectory when rolling down a slope. Here, we develop an algorithm to design such bodies-which we call 'trajectoids'-and then validate these designs experimentally by three-dimensionally printing the computed shapes and tracking their rolling paths, including those that close onto themselves such that the body's centre of mass moves intermittently uphill (Supplementary Video 2). Our study is motivated largely by fundamental curiosity, but the existence of trajectoids for most paths has unexpected implications for quantum and classical optics, as the dynamics of qubits, spins and light polarization can be exactly mapped to trajectoids and their paths 16.

Computational modeling

To represent a random configuration of silica particles on a cubic domain, spheres are scattered by choosing the center coordinates of each individual sphere uniformly at random. Spheres are placed one-by-one so that the distances from the designated center position to the center positions of pre-existing spheres are apart from each other farther than the diameter. The diameter of the sphere is set to the average size of the silica filler, and the number of spheres per unit volume is determined according to the weight ratio of silica particles in the composite samples used in the experiments.

Upon the completion of the random placement of circular fillers, a CNT network is created on the domain by placing multiple random instances of a flexible wire. According to morphological characteristics as observed in the SEM and TEM images, a random instance of the wire is placed so that a CNT wire is distributed uniformly in the simulation domain and can proceed forwardly to pass through a gap between silica particles but cannot penetrate the particles. The flexibility of a CNT wire is reflected by modeling them as a series of small line segments connected with joints that can bend freely within a certain degree (up to 120°). To create a single wire on the domain, constituting line segments are placed in sequence from one side to the other. The first line segment is placed at random in the volume that spheres do not occupy. Subsequent line segments are placed in a straight line unless they touch spheres. If the line segment touches a sphere, the direction of the line segment is changed toward a tangential direction of the sphere in contact so that the wire smoothly circumvents the sphere. The width and length of a single wire are set to the average diameter and length of CNTs used in the experiment, respectively. The length of a line segment is set the same as the width of the wire, and thus the line segment can be thought as of a small spherical cylinder of the identical height and width, i.e. with a square side view. This facilitates the test for the connectivity of two wires since the contact suffices to check whether, at each endpoint of a line segment, there exists any other endpoint of a line segment from a different wire within a ball of radius equal to the length of the line segment centered at the endpoint. A graphical description of the procedure is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 1. A sample cubic domain of 10 μm × 10 μm × 10 μm is taken from the composite model to obtain the CNT network. The connectivity of the domain is checked by examining the contacts between flexible wires. For a pair of two wires, all possible pairwise distances between two line segments from respective wires are calculated. If at least one value of the distances is less than 2 nm, which is based on a tunneling mechanism (see Supplementary Note 1) –, the two wires are considered to be in contact at the position of the corresponding line segments. A graphical representation of the procedure is presented in Supplementary Fig. 2. A clustering analysis identifies percolating clusters of wires that span across the domain. Starting from the leftmost wires touching the left end, each cluster is expanded gradually toward the right end by including wires in contact. If a cluster contains one of the rightmost wires touching the right end, this cluster is declared to be a conducting path. For all conducting paths, KCL is applied at all junctions of wires to construct a system of linear equations about voltage drops across the junctions due to the contact resistivity (ρ c). In the simulation, ρ c is considered as a tunneling resistivity arising from the thin insulating layer (i.e. epoxy resin) between crossing CNTs –. Since 1 V voltage is assumed to apply across the domain, the inverse of the solution of the system of linear equations corresponds to the overall resistance of the network. This process is repeated to obtain 500 independent random instances, and an ensemble average of the resistance is calculated based on the set of tested samples between 30th percentile and 70th percentile. The simulation is conducted over different configurations of silica content, silica size, CNT content, and CNT dimension. For massive simulation, the source code is implemented in MATLAB parallel computing tool box.

### Accurate eye tracking from dense 3D surface reconstructions using single-shot deflectometry [^773090b5]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

We use the single-shot stereo-deflectometry method paired with our refined surface reconstruction (see section "Gaze estimation from deflectometry measurements using an improved normal and shape reconstruction method", now for only one sphere instead of two) to measure and reconstruct the spherical surface of the bearing ball. We capture a total of 56,140 surface points and respective surface normals in only one single-shot. An exemplary image from camera 1 is shown in Fig. 5 a. The respective surface reconstruction (including normals) is shown in Fig. 5 b. To quantify the quality of our reconstruction we calculate two metrics: The best-fit radius of the final reconstructed surface after refinement, and the precision at which the back-traced normals meet at one point (the center of the sphere). The radius of our reconstructed surface is calculated to R m = 12.02 mm, which deviates only 20 μm from the specified radius of the bearing ball. To evaluate the precision of the calculated surface normals, we back-trace all surface normals towards the center of the sphere and estimate the sphere center by calculating their best-fit intersection point. Eventually, the precision σ m is calculated via the standard deviation of the absolute distance of the backtraced normals to the calculated center. We obtain a standard deviation of only σ m = 62 μm.

### BAM, physical activity, table tennis archive… [^b490f79d]. archive.cdc.gov (2019). Medium credibility.

Next, you'll need a ball and paddles. The balls used in tournaments and during professional competitions are made of plastic and are hollow inside. Paddles, sometimes called rackets, are mostly made of wood. Each side is covered with a sheet of rubber. Often times the rubber sheets are made with different textures. This allows players to hit the ball at different speeds and with different types of spin. Even if a player chose different textures for each side of the paddle, official regulations require one side to be red and one side to be black. This way, players can always tell which side of the paddle their opponent is using. Games Chances are, you've played table tennis at school or at a friend's house. But did you know table tennis, also called Ping-Pong, is one of the most popular competitive sports in the world. It can be very different from what you might play at school or at home with friends.

Table tennis is played at a very fast pace – some people even say it's the fastest ball sport in the world. This makes it really challenging and requires athletes to be in great shape. AND, they have to have super hand-eye coordination. Stand far enough from the table so that your arm and paddle can be fully extended. Shift your weight to the balls of your feet, and keep your knees slightly bent. Lean forward a bit, using your non-paddle hand to keep balance. Toss the ball up for a serve, and let it bounce one time before hitting it. Each player serves five times, and then the serve goes to their opponent. Stand like you're about to serve the ball for a forehand shot. Only this time, face sideways so that your non-paddle shoulder points toward the other player. Swing your paddle back, shifting your hips in the same direction. Remember that the further you swing back, the more powerful the shot will be.

Hold the paddle at the height of your waist, and keep your wrist tilted slightly toward the floor. This way you'll hit the ball in an upward direction and send it over the net. Swing your arms and hips forward, and take your shot. When you take a backhand shot, your thumb should be on the back of your paddle. Like in the forehand shot, your non-paddle shoulder should face your opponent, and the paddle should be waist-high. Let your elbow lead your arm as you swing quickly and hit the ball as it bounces off the table.

### Magic number colloidal clusters as minimum free energy structures [^0a81c83e]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Model generation

Clusters were generated by choosing the positions of identical spheres according to geometric construction rules. All models correspond to one or multiple domains with perfect, sheared, or otherwise deformed FCC crystal structure. Deformations were chosen to maximize symmetry and packing fraction. MCCs were constructed in five steps by placing 130 tetrahedral grains, each with (m + 1)(m + 2)(m + 3)/6 spheres (Mackay core with m shells). Multiple tetrahedra share spheres at vertices, edges, and faces. The first step follows Mackayby placing 20 tetrahedral grains around a common vertex with the constraint that spheres in each shell touch spheres in the previous shell. In step two, 20 identical tetrahedra were placed over the faces such that the top shells of the Mackay icosahedron acted as mirror planes. In the third step, the gaps were filled by connecting existing vertices. These tetrahedra were slightly more deformed than the previous ones. In the fourth step, vertex regions were filled with pentagonal bipyramids made from five tetrahedral grains such that symmetry was preserved. These tetrahedra had the largest deformation. In the fifth step, all spheres outside of a central sphere with truncation radius R cut were removed. Clusters with FCC structure for the free energy calculations in Fig. 5h were generated by applying only the truncation step to a single FCC grain. The model generation was implemented in a Python code.

Cluster type classification

MCC type for clusters assembled in experiment or simulation was identified by evaluating the characteristic rectangular features (width a + 1, height l + 1) and truncated triangle features (edge lengths (m − l − a)/2 + 1 and l + 1) with an integer l that describes the amount of vertex truncation. Vertex truncation varies from cluster to cluster (Supplementary Figure 17) broadening the minima in Fig. 5h.

### Self-assembly by anti-repellent structures for programming particles with momentum [^1fc93927]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Methods

Granule data extraction

MATLAB software was used for extracting trap and granule information. In order to analyse the position and information of the traps and granules, the 'imfindcircle' and 'regionprops' functions were utilised, and the centre point, circularity, perimeter, and size data were obtained from the function options. Exploiting the extracted information, listing trap and granule data was feasible, and through the organised data, information and distribution of size, circularity, and circularity per perimeter ratio were analysed. Finally, based on the extracted data, the distances, radii, and angles between two traps and granules were obtained, and vector weights could be calculated.

Unique contact point analysis

The 'imfindcircle' and 'regionprops' functions were exploited in order to obtain the point and data of the traps and granules, and the centre points were realised by using the function options. All the contact points between traps and granules were assumed that the touched points were orthographic locations of the granule centre points. Contact point data were accumulated by imaging and processing hundreds of granules, and the 'unique' function was operated to confirm whether the contact points of all granules were unique. In the case of the vector-based contact points, all granules possessed distinguishable points even if the imaging resolutions were diverse in hundreds of granules. However, in the case of the pixel-based contact points, a large number of the points overlapped and therefore uniqueness was low. Furthermore, the overlapped point numbers were significantly high under low-resolution conditions.

Encoding capacity estimation

By utilising 200 diverse 2 × 2 granule array groups, 40,000 weight values were obtained successfully, of which 200 were intra-groups and the remaining 39,800 belonged to weight values compared between inter-groups. Therefore, since the weight value between intra and inter-groups was not a single value but consisted of more than 200 values, it formed a distribution. Normalised Gaussian fitting could be performed through the mean and standard deviation value of the intra and inter-group distribution of weight value, and the false rate could be estimated based on the portion where intra and inter-group distributions overlapped each other, threshold point. Since the estimated false rate by the distributions means that the keys can be distinguished as much as the value, the reciprocal of the false rate was calculated as encoding capacity.

### Measuring the size of individual particles from three-dimensional imaging experiments [^f215a900]. Nature Communications (2012). Medium credibility.

Often experimentalists study particulate samples that are nominally monodisperse. In reality, many samples have a polydispersity of 4–10%. At the level of an individual particle, the consequences of this polydispersity are unknown as it is difficult to measure an individual particle size from images of a dense sample. Here we propose a method to estimate individual particle radii from three-dimensional data of the particle positions. We first validate our method with simulations. We then apply our method to experimental data of colloidal suspensions observed with confocal microscopy. We demonstrate that we can recover the full particle size distribution in situ. Finally, we use our method to study the relationship between homogeneous colloidal crystal nucleation and particle sizes. We show that nucleation occurs in regions that are more monodisperse than average.

### A 3D ray traced biological neural network learning model [^d16b5e85]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Hidden neurons and glial cells' location assignment

In our model, both hidden neurons and glial cells are uniformly distributed in a network sphere of radius r s. To achieve that, we set up a spherical coordinate centered at the sphere origin withthe unit vectors pointing to the radial, polar and azimuthal directions as shown in Fig. 6 a. Within the sphere, every small volumecentered at (r, θ, ϕ) should contain the same number of cells, except for statistical fluctuations. Therefore, to assign the location of a cell i, we first generate three random numbers, and, each uniformly distributed within 0 to 1. Then the position of the cell (r i, θ i, ϕ i) can be assigned following the formula below:

### Observation of solid-solid transitions in 3D crystals of colloidal superballs [^f2263448]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Self-organization in anisotropic colloidal suspensions leads to a fascinating range of crystal and liquid crystal phases induced by shape alone. Simulations predict the phase behaviour of a plethora of shapes while experimental realization often lags behind. Here, we present the experimental phase behaviour of superball particles with a shape in between that of a sphere and a cube. In particular, we observe the formation of a plastic crystal phase with translational order and orientational disorder, and the subsequent transformation into rhombohedral crystals. Moreover, we uncover that the phase behaviour is richer than predicted, as we find two distinct rhombohedral crystals with different stacking variants, namely hollow-site and bridge-site stacking. In addition, for slightly softer interactions we observe a solid-solid transition between the two. Our investigation brings us one step closer to ultimately controlling the experimental self-assembly of superballs into functional materials, such as photonic crystals.

### Measurement of gravitational coupling between millimetre-sized masses [^a0e464da]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

Gravity is the weakest of all known fundamental forces and poses some of the most important open questions to modern physics: it remains resistant to unification within the standard model of physics and its underlying concepts appear to be fundamentally disconnected from quantum theory 1–4. Testing gravity at all scales is therefore an important experimental endeavour 5–7. So far, these tests have mainly involved macroscopic masses at the kilogram scale and beyond 8. Here we show gravitational coupling between two gold spheres of 1 millimetre radius, thereby entering the regime of sub-100-milligram sources of gravity. Periodic modulation of the position of the source mass allows us to perform a spatial mapping of the gravitational force. Both linear and quadratic coupling are observed as a consequence of the nonlinearity of the gravitational potential. Our results extend the parameter space of gravity measurements to small, single source masses and low gravitational field strengths. Further improvements to our methodology will enable the isolation of gravity as a coupling force for objects below the Planck mass. This work opens the way to the unexplored frontier of microscopic source masses, which will enable studies of fundamental interactions 9–11 and provide a path towards exploring the quantum nature of gravity 12–15.

### A first-principle mechanism for particulate aggregation and self-assembly in stratified fluids [^cef57dd8]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

An extremely broad and important class of phenomena in nature involves the settling and aggregation of matter under gravitation in fluid systems. Here, we observe and model mathematically an unexpected fundamental mechanism by which particles suspended within stratification may self-assemble and form large aggregates without adhesion. This phenomenon arises through a complex interplay involving solute diffusion, impermeable boundaries, and aggregate geometry, which produces toroidal flows. We show that these flows yield attractive horizontal forces between particles at the same heights. We observe that many particles demonstrate a collective motion revealing a system which appears to solve jigsaw-like puzzles on its way to organizing into a large-scale disc-like shape, with the effective force increasing as the collective disc radius grows. Control experiments isolate the individual dynamics, which are quantitatively predicted by simulations. Numerical force calculations with two spheres are used to build many-body simulations which capture observed features of self-assembly.

### Force can overcome object geometry in the perception of shape through active touch [^a70b1345]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

Haptic (touch) perception normally entails an active exploration of object surfaces over time. This is called active touch. When exploring the shape of an object, we experience both geometrical and force cues. For example, when sliding a finger across a surface with a rigid bump on it, the finger moves over the bump while being opposed by a force whose direction and magnitude are related to the slope of the bump. The steeper the bump, the stronger the resistance. Geometrical and force cues are correlated, but it has been commonly assumed that shape perception relies on object geometry alone. Here we show that regardless of surface geometry, subjects identified and located shape features on the basis of force cues or their correlates. Using paradoxical stimuli, for example combining the force cues of a bump with the geometry of a hole, we found that subjects perceived a bump. Conversely, when combining the force cues of a hole with the geometry of a bump, subjects typically perceived a hole.

### Placenta microstructure and microcirculation imaging with diffusion MRI [^f72bd705]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Areas with Diffusion Restriction

The diffusion signal persists at relatively high b ‐values (Fig. 2), and restriction models fit the DWI signal best in 5–22% of voxels, depending on tissue type and subject (Fig. 4). These effects are correlated: areas where signal persists at high b ‐values often correspond with stick‐ball‐sphere being the preferred model (, circled areas in 1st and 2nd columns).also shows sphere volume fraction maps; notably there are many areas within the placenta with zero sphere fraction, suggesting no detectable restriction (, arrows). This may correspond to areas dominated by maternal blood within intervillous space. We also plotted sphere radius maps (, 4th column) that reveal areas with low sphere radius and non‐zero sphere volume fraction (, circled areas in 3rd and 4th columns), suggesting diffusion restriction. This is consistent with higher cellularity in these areas, although we emphasize that, despite our use of a spherical restriction model, outer cell membranes are not the only structures that can cause restriction.

Our initial observations suggest some evidence for restricted diffusion, but it does not appear to be a dominant effect. This interpretation is consistent with the placental anatomy, which contains large areas of intervillous space where restriction is unlikely to occur. Quantification of restriction may have applications in early assessment of placental abnormalities; for example, the invasion of trophoblast cells into the uterine wall plays an important role in the normal remodeling of spiral arteries during early pregnancy 38, 39, 40. Future acquisition protocols with higher b ‐values and SNR may provide better access to this compartment.

### Entropically engineered formation of fivefold and icosahedral twinned clusters of colloidal shapes [^fac4b606]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Seed-assisted growth MC simulation

We conducted seed-assisted growth simulation at a fluid-solid coexistence state (forsystem). For the growth of the fivefold twinned cluster, we used a spherical cluster of a cubic diamond crystal as a seed, and the total system size including the seed is. At a very dilute condition, we placed the seed at the center of simulation box and placed other particles around the seed without overlap. Fixing the seed particles in place, we compressed the simulation box to the target particle volume fraction. Once it reached the target particle volume fraction, we released the seed particles and equilibrated the system. For the growth of the icosahedral twinned cluster, we used a fivefold twinned cluster as a seed, and the total system size including the seed is. The compression and equilibration protocol is the same in both cases.

Local volume fraction calculation

Seed-assisted growth simulations for fivefold and icosahedral twinned clusters were performed in at coexistence between a fluid phase and a crystal phase, where the solid clusters are fully surrounded by fluid. To distinguish the two phases, we calculated the local particle volume fraction, which is defined as the particle volume fraction around a particle within a certain radius. The value ofin this study was taken to be 3 times the distance from a particle center to its nearest neighbor particle center, in order to properly average the local environment. TTs are identified as belonging to the fluid region ifand to the crystal region if. We utilized the freud python library for this calculation.

Stability check of an icosahedral twinned cluster of hard spheres

We performed MC simulations of a hard sphere system to check the stability of an icosahedral twinned cluster of hard spheres at fluid-solid coexistence. We first constructed an icosahedral cluster with an ideal structure, following the method described in ref. At a very dilute condition, we placed the ico-twin cluster at the center of simulation box and placed other hard spheres around the cluster without overlap. Temporarily "freezing" the ico-twin particles in place, we compressed the simulation box to the target particle volume fraction. Once it reached the target particle volume fraction, we released the ico-twin cluster particles and equilibrated the system. To check if the ico-twin cluster is stable in the coexistence phase, we monitored the bond-order diagram and the morphology of the ico-twin cluster during the simulation. We observed the icosahedral structure rapidly destabilize withinMC steps (Fig. 4a).

### Detecting the ultra low dimensionality of real networks [^72f4c17c]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Dimensionality is a key concept in the project of understanding the geometrical structure of reality. In recent years, the quest to identify dimensionality has reached computer science and network science where, sustained by phenomena of measure concentration, complex data and interactions only populate a small subspace of their original high-dimensional space. The method we present here does not need any a priori spatial embedding and infers the dimensionality of a graph by exploiting the fact that the densities of edge cycles in its topology carry information about its dimensionality. Our results not only prove that complex networks populate a reduced region of a high-dimensional space but also that they are well represented in hyperbolic geometry with ultra low dimensionality.

This claim is valid for complex networks that are simultaneously sparse, small-world, and highly clustered, and possibly — but not necessarily — with heterogeneous degree distributions. Even if a real network is naturally embedded in Euclidean space, this minimal set of complex features ensures that our methodology is applicable, meaning that explicit Euclidean distances in those systems are not the only factor that determines connectivity in the network and other features may have a role as well. At the same time, our formalism is also valid for geometric random graphs, which are very homogeneous and clustered and non small world networks, which happen in our model when γ > 3 and β > 2 D. This means that graphs in this region of the parameter space are effectively described by the geometry of the D -sphere, which becomes the Euclidean space in the thermodynamic limit, rather than by hyperbolic geometry. Finally, links in D -dimensional lattices are strongly correlated whereas in our model links are statistical independent. D -dimensional lattices are, thus, not suited to being described by our hyperbolic multidimensional model.

### Machine learning meets complex networks via coalescent embedding in the hyperbolic space [^4aa17e63]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Physicists recently observed that realistic complex networks emerge as discrete samples from a continuous hyperbolic geometry enclosed in a circle: the radius represents the node centrality and the angular displacement between two nodes resembles their topological proximity. The hyperbolic circle aims to become a universal space of representation and analysis of many real networks. Yet, inferring the angular coordinates to map a real network back to its latent geometry remains a challenging inverse problem. Here, we show that intelligent machines for unsupervised recognition and visualization of similarities in big data can also infer the network angular coordinates of the hyperbolic model according to a geometrical organization that we term "angular coalescence". Based on this phenomenon, we propose a class of algorithms that offers fast and accurate "coalescent embedding" in the hyperbolic circle even for large networks. This computational solution to an inverse problem in physics of complex systems favors the application of network latent geometry techniques in disciplines dealing with big network data analysis including biology, medicine, and social science.

### A mathematical modelling tool for predicting survival of individual patients following resection of glioblastoma: a proof of principle [^bbf1533a]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Data analysis

Statistical analysis was performed, as noted throughout the text. From the pre-operative MRI volumes, we calculated the average radii of equivalent spheres of the T1-Gd and T2 volumes for each of the 70 patients (Figure 2). These became the actual data from which all of the rest of the calculations derive (see Results section). The mean T1-Gd radius was 2.01 cm, the median 2.13 cm and the range from 0.86 to 3.26 cm. The mean T2-weighted radius was 2.89 cm, the median 2.84 cm, and the range from 1.05 to 4.75 cm.

We used other clinical data provided to classify each actual patient according to the extent of resection. We found that there is no statistically significant difference between the means of the T1-Gd radii of the 7 biopsy patients (2.03 cm) and the 31 STR patients (2.20 cm, P = 0.43) or of the 7 biopsy and 32 GTR patients (1.81 cm, P = 0.44), in large part because of the small number of biopsy patients (N = 7); but there is a significant difference between the means of the T1-Gd radii of the combined 38 biopsy and STR patients (mean = 2.17 cm) and the 32 GTR patients (P = 0.01 using Student's t -test). Justification for this combination of patients is provided in the Results section.

From the diagnostic MRI tumour volumes, we have also calculated the actual ratio, D / ρ, for each of the 70 patients and found the median to be 9.83 mm 2, the mean 10.52 mm 2 and the range from 0.24 to 35.92 mm 2. There is no significant difference in the distributions of the ratio D / ρ between actual patients who had had steroids for a few days (N = 22) and those who had not had steroid (N = 45) before their MRIs (Figure 4A, P = 0.75 by Kolmogorov-Smirnov's test (K-S test)), having used steroids for a longer time to see any effect. There is also no difference in the distributions of the ratio D / ρ for the actual biopsy, STR and GTR patients (Figure 4B, K-S test P = 0.675).

### A computational toolbox for the assembly yield of complex and heterogeneous structures [^0deafad0]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The self-assembly of complex structures from a set of non-identical building blocks is a hallmark of soft matter and biological systems, including protein complexes, colloidal clusters, and DNA-based assemblies. Predicting the dependence of the equilibrium assembly yield on the concentrations and interaction energies of building blocks is highly challenging, owing to the difficulty of computing the entropic contributions to the free energy of the many structures that compete with the ground state configuration. While these calculations yield well known results for spherically symmetric building blocks, they do not hold when the building blocks have internal rotational degrees of freedom. Here we present an approach for solving this problem that works with arbitrary building blocks, including proteins with known structure and complex colloidal building blocks. Our algorithm combines classical statistical mechanics with recently developed computational tools for automatic differentiation. Automatic differentiation allows efficient evaluation of equilibrium averages over configurations that would otherwise be intractable. We demonstrate the validity of our framework by comparison to molecular dynamics simulations of simple examples, and apply it to calculate the yield curves for known protein complexes and for the assembly of colloidal shells.

### Universality in long-distance geometry and quantum complexity [^57982296]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

In physics, two systems that radically differ at short scales can exhibit strikingly similar macroscopic behaviour: they are part of the same long-distance universality class 1. Here we apply this viewpoint to geometry and initiate a program of classifying homogeneous metrics on group manifolds 2 by their long-distance properties. We show that many metrics on low-dimensional Lie groups have markedly different short-distance properties but nearly identical distance functions at long distances, and provide evidence that this phenomenon is even more robust in high dimensions. An application of these ideas of particular interest to physics and computer science is complexity geometry 3–7 -the study of quantum computational complexity using Riemannian geometry. We argue for the existence of a large universality class of definitions of quantum complexity, each linearly related to the other, a much finer-grained equivalence than typically considered. We conjecture that a new effective metric emerges at larger complexities that describes a broad class of complexity geometries, insensitive to various choices of microscopic penalty factors. We discuss the implications for recent conjectures in quantum gravity.

### Structured spheres generated by an in-fibre fluid instability [^ac910cda]. Nature (2012). Excellent credibility.

From drug delivery to chemical and biological catalysis and cosmetics, the need for efficient fabrication pathways for particles over a wide range of sizes, from a variety of materials, and in many different structures has been well established. Here we harness the inherent scalability of fibre production and an in-fibre Plateau-Rayleigh capillary instability for the fabrication of uniformly sized, structured spherical particles spanning an exceptionally wide range of sizes: from 2mm down to 20nm. Thermal processing of a multimaterial fibre controllably induces the instability, resulting in a well-ordered, oriented emulsion in three dimensions. The fibre core and cladding correspond to the dispersed and continuous phases, respectively, and are both frozen in situ on cooling, after which the particles are released when needed. By arranging a variety of structures and materials in a macroscopic scaled-up model of the fibre, we produce composite, structured, spherical particles, such as core-shell particles, two-compartment 'Janus' particles, and multi-sectioned 'beach ball' particles. Moreover, producing fibres with a high density of cores allows for an unprecedented level of parallelization. In principle, 10(8) 50-nm cores may be embedded in metres-long, 1-mm-diameter fibre, which can be induced to break up simultaneously throughout its length, into uniformly sized, structured spheres.

### EANM practical guidance on uncertainty analysis for molecular radiotherapy absorbed dose calculations [^1eb6c781]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

For situations where both voxelization and resolution contribute significantly to diametric uncertainty (such as outlining directly on a SPECT image), Eqs. 17 and 18 are summed to give the combined uncertainty associated with d:

In practice the diameter is not measured and only the volume is reported. However, conceptually the volume is determined through an infinite number of diametric measurements, and the mean diameter of the VOI can therefore be considered. The standard uncertainty u (d) translates into a standard uncertainty u (v) associated with the volume v delineated by the outline. Hence, for some positive constant k,

The application of the variant of LPU (GUM formula 12) yields a relationship between the relative volume and diametric uncertainties due to voxelization and resolution:

Hence, a fractional standard uncertainty associated with a volume is three times the fractional standard uncertainty associated with the mean diameter of that volume.

Count rate

The total reconstructed count rate, C, within a VOI depends on the VOI delineation, and can be described as a function of volume. Propagation of volume uncertainty into the measurement of count rate is therefore required. As no prior knowledge of the count distribution is generally available, the variation in C within the VOI must be approximated.

A uniformly distributed spherical count rate density H (ρ) with volume v true of radius r, with a total emission count rate of C total, can be described in spherical coordinates as:where ρ is the radial distance from the centre of the sphere.

Due to the spatial limitations of the measuring system the apparent density is described as the spherical volume convolved with a 3D Gaussian function :where σ is the measured standard deviation describing the width of the 3D Gaussian function. Therefore, an observed count rate density distribution can be described as:where ∗ denotes convolution in three dimensions, which can be determined analytically and re-expressed as:

### Crystallization seeds favour crystallization only during initial growth [^6fb90e6a]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Simulations

Brownian dynamics simulations are performed that use a spherical simulation box of diameter σ 0. It is filled with 500,000 hard spheres with diameter σ 1 and volume fraction Φ = 0.53, as well as a large hard sphere with diameter σ 2 fixed in the centre of the box. To mimic the precrystallized layer in the experiments, the large sphere is decorated by a hexagonal layer of fixed hard spheres with a lattice constant 1.133 σ 1 and, unavoidably, a few defects. If the large sphere is decorated by a layer of particles on which no order is imposed or which only initially are hexagonally arranged but then allowed to move freely, qualitatively similar but quantitatively different behaviour is observed. The outer wall of the simulation box is covered with fixed disordered spheres, which interact with the mobile spheres via a Yukawa potential whose range is adjusted to yield a constant volume fraction of the fluid during the whole crystallization process. This is similar in spirit to a constant pressure simulation and mimics the experimental situation.

An initial configuration of non-overlapping randomly arranged particles is prepared by random insertions of spheres. The initial configuration does not significantly affect the results apart from rearrangements during a time t < τ B. Simulations were run with time steps of about 0.001 τ B. To improve statistics, several runs, typically three, are performed with different initial configurations. The results are averaged and the s.d. determined and shown as error bars. In addition, to improve the statistics of the mean squared displacement 〈Δ r 2 (τ)〉 (Fig. 4), runs with three different initial times t −Δ t, t and t +Δ t, with, are averaged.

### Lock and key colloids [^042b742c]. Nature (2010). Excellent credibility.

New functional materials can in principle be created using colloids that self-assemble into a desired structure by means of a programmable recognition and binding scheme. This idea has been explored by attaching 'programmed' DNA strands to nanometre- and micrometre- sized particles and then using DNA hybridization to direct the placement of the particles in the final assembly. Here we demonstrate an alternative recognition mechanism for directing the assembly of composite structures, based on particles with complementary shapes. Our system, which uses Fischer's lock-and-key principle, employs colloidal spheres as keys and monodisperse colloidal particles with a spherical cavity as locks that bind spontaneously and reversibly via the depletion interaction. The lock-and-key binding is specific because it is controlled by how closely the size of a spherical colloidal key particle matches the radius of the spherical cavity of the lock particle. The strength of the binding can be further tuned by adjusting the solution composition or temperature. The composite assemblies have the unique feature of having flexible bonds, allowing us to produce flexible dimeric, trimeric and tetrameric colloidal molecules as well as more complex colloidal polymers. We expect that this lock-and-key recognition mechanism will find wider use as a means of programming and directing colloidal self-assembly.

### Impact of photoreceptor density in a 3D simulation of panretinal laser photocoagulation [^1efd119b]. BMC Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

3D average distribution of photoreceptors

We constructed the 3D average distribution of photoreceptors using 3D CAD software (SolidWorks 2017 standard®) using the photoreceptor density data from a previous study. Four graphs of photoreceptor densities in four directions (superior, inferior, nasal, and temporal) were obtained and representative graphs with the same eccentricity of the fovea were averaged, and an average photoreceptor density graph was created. This graph was rotated around the y-axis, and the 3D average distribution of photoreceptors was constructed using Solidwork 2017 standard®. In addition to the island-shaped solid representing the total photoreceptor distribution, the cubic volume of the solid represents the number of photoreceptors.

Simulation of PRP

Simulations of scatter PRP and full scatter PRP (size 400 μm on the retina, 1 spot width apart) were performed using a geometry-based simulation as previously described. To facilitate a better understanding of some relevant concepts, we describe important aspects of the geometry-based simulation as follows.

We used a geometric formula to calculate the curved surface area of a spherical dome (a portion of a sphere transected by a plane; see Fig. 1 a). If the radius of the dome is r, the height of the dome is h, the radius of the base is c, and the area of the base is B, the curved surface area (S) excluding B of the dome is as follows (see Fig. 1 a):If the values of c and h for the eye are known, the curved area of the retina as a whole is equal to the area of a circle with a radius of. The area of the whole retina can be considered to be a part of a sphere; thus, the entire retinal area corresponds to the curved surface area of a spherical dome. The dimensions of a standard eye were derived from a textbook (Fig. 1 b), and inserting these values into the abovementioned equation shows that the whole retinal area is equal to the area of a circle with a radius of 18.6-mm (Fig. 1 b).

### A nanometre-scale resolution interference-based probe of interfacial phenomena between microscopic objects and surfaces [^b589a50f]. Nature Communications (2013). Medium credibility.

Interferometric techniques have proven useful to infer proximity and local surface profiles of microscopic objects near surfaces. But a critical trade-off emerges between accuracy and mathematical complexity when these methods are applied outside the vicinity of closest approach. Here we introduce a significant advancement that enables reflection interference contrast microscopy to provide nearly instantaneous reconstruction of an arbitrary convex object's contour next to a bounding surface with nanometre resolution, making it possible to interrogate microparticle/surface interaction phenomena at radii of curvature 1,000 times smaller than those accessible by the conventional surface force apparatus. The unique view-from-below perspective of reflection interference contrast microscopy also reveals previously unseen deformations and allows the first direct observation of femtolitre-scale capillary condensation dynamics underneath micron-sized particles. Our implementation of reflection interference contrast microscopy provides a generally applicable nanometre-scale resolution tool that can be potentially exploited to dynamically probe ensembles of objects near surfaces so that statistical/probabilistic behaviour can be realistically captured.

### Mutual information reveals multiple structural relaxation mechanisms in a model glass former [^3ac01c7a]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Among the key challenges to our understanding of solidification in the glass transition is that it is accompanied by little apparent change in structure. Recently, geometric motifs have been identified in glassy liquids, but a causal link between these motifs and solidification remains elusive. One 'smoking gun' for such a link would be identical scaling of structural and dynamic lengthscales on approaching the glass transition, but this is highly controversial. Here we introduce an information theoretic approach to determine correlations in displacement for particle relaxation encoded in the initial configuration of a glass-forming liquid. We uncover two populations of particles, one inclined to relax quickly, the other slowly. Each population is correlated with local density and geometric motifs. Our analysis further reveals a dynamic lengthscale similar to that associated with structural properties, which may resolve the discrepancy between structural and dynamic lengthscales.

### Cortical thickness systematically varies with curvature and depth in healthy human brains [^4c04d438]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

2.4.2 Mean curvature

Unlike Gaussian curvature, mean curvature is an extrinsic property of the surface, providing a useful measure of foldedness. It has an intuitive meaning, changing as a piece of paper is folded into a cone or cylinder. Just like paper folding, the extent of shape change might be restricted by intrinsic properties of the surface, such as its initial thickness and surface area (Mota & Herculano‐Houzel). The direction of the outward unit normal provides the orientation at a given point, so that the mean curvature distinguished between convex and concave shapes. It has previously been shown to be a good indicator of gyral and sulcal patterns of the cortex (Batchelor et al; Cachia et al; Luders et al.). For discrete surfaces, the mean curvaturecan be calculated bywhereis the number of edges connected to the vertex; denotes the length of the i th edge connected to the vertex; is the dihedral angle, or the angle between normal vectors of the adjacent triangles meeting at the edge; andis the sum of the areas of the adjacent triangles (Mesmoudi et al.) (Figure 6). This formulation assumes that the neighboring vertices of the polygon is a cylindrical arc with a small radius tangent to adjacent edges.

2.4.3 Principal curvatures

At a given point on a curved surface, there are two orthogonal planes that correspond to the maximum and minimum normal curvatures, and, respectively. (Here we use the convention, but note that some studies instead use.) The principal curvatures are quantified as the reciprocal of the radius of the circle of best fit tangent to the surface at that point. The local shape of a point on an arbitrary surface can be determined by principle curvatures (Figure 7). They can be calculated from the mean and Gaussian curvature asand) (Gray,) or conversely, the mean and Gaussian curvature can be written in terms of principal curvatures asand, respectively. In this study, we calculated the principal curvatures from the values of mean and Gaussian curvature at each vertex (Hu et al.).

### Global comparative structural analysis of responses to protein phosphorylation [^cbd9f846]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Linear mutual information comparisons

For each structure whose dynamics were modeled with NMA, we derived a matrix of mutual information values. Each entry i j in this matrix quantifies the degree to which the motion of residues i and j are coupled. Values range from 0 (complete independence between residue motions) to 1 (complete dependence). This allows us to detect dependencies in predicted residue motions regardless of their direction or linearity.

We compared these matrices using the R V 2 coefficient. The R V 2 coefficient is a measure of similarity between two matrices, ranging between −1 and 1, with the same interpretation as Pearson correlation. It corrects the inflated values produced by the original R V coefficient on high dimensional data. R V 2 coefficients were calculated using Hoggorm v0.13.3.

In order to detect communities of residues with coupled dynamics, we clustered residues using HDBSCANwith default parameters and the mutual information matrix as input.

Protein strain analysis

PSA calculates mechanical strain by adapting the formalism of finite strain theory to protein structures. Strain is a well-established physical concept that measures how much an object is locally deformed between a reference state and a deformed state. For each C α, we define a local neighbourhood of a fixed radius and select all the C α within this sphere. Then, PSA quantifies how the relative positions between the central atom and its neighbours change from the reference to the deformed state. To perform all mechanical deformations analyses, we used the Python library PSA v1.1. See ref.for a comprehensive description of the theoretical framework.

The data used in this analysis comprised two datasets: the protein structures described in the "Structural data collection and curation" subsection of the "Methods" and annotated protein functional sites mined from UniProt (including the categories active site, binding site, DNA binding site, and site). Protein structures with substantial regions of unmodeled residues were excluded, as these gaps in the structure prevent the calculation of local deformations. After filtering, the final dataset consisted of 139 proteins, comprising 179 different phosphosites and 487 protein functional sites.

### Colloid science: non-spherical bubbles [^a1f7f043]. Nature (2005). Excellent credibility.

Surface tension gives gas bubbles their perfect spherical shape by minimizing the surface area for a given volume. Here we show that gas bubbles and liquid drops can exist in stable, non-spherical shapes if the surface is covered, or 'armoured', with a close-packed monolayer of particles. When two spherical armoured bubbles are fused, jamming of the particles on the interface supports the unequal stresses that are necessary to stabilize a non-spherical shape.

### Mathematical description of q-space in spherical coordinates: exact q-ball imaging [^267854bb]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Novel methodologies have been recently developed to characterize the microgeometry of neural tissues and porous structures via diffusion MRI data. In line with these previous works, this article provides a detailed mathematical description of q-space in spherical coordinates that helps to highlight the differences and similarities between various related q-space methodologies proposed to date such as q-ball imaging (QBI), diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI), and diffusion orientation transform imaging (DOT). This formulation provides a direct relationship between the orientation distribution function (ODF) and the diffusion data without using any approximation. Under this relationship, the exact ODF can be computed by means of the Radon transform of the radial projection (in q-space) of the diffusion MRI signal. This new methodology, termed exact q-ball imaging (EQBI), was put into practice using an analytical ODF estimation in terms of spherical harmonics that allows obtaining model-free and model-based reconstructions. This work provides a new framework for combining information coming from diffusion data recorded on multiple spherical shells in q-space (hybrid diffusion imaging encoding scheme), which is capable of mapping ODF to a high accuracy. This represents a step toward a more efficient development of diffusion MRI experiments for obtaining better ODF estimates.

### Pore configuration landscape of granular crystallization [^a97f1c0c]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Uncovering grain-scale mechanisms that underlie the disorder-order transition in assemblies of dissipative, athermal particles is a fundamental problem with technological relevance. To date, the study of granular crystallization has mainly focussed on the symmetry of crystalline patterns while their emergence and growth from irregular clusters of grains remains largely unexplored. Here crystallization of three-dimensional packings of frictional spheres is studied at the grain-scale using X-ray tomography and persistent homology. The latter produces a map of the topological configurations of grains within static partially crystallized packings. Using numerical simulations, we show that similar maps are measured dynamically during the melting of a perfect crystal. This map encodes new information on the formation process of tetrahedral and octahedral pores, the building blocks of perfect crystals. Four key formation mechanisms of these pores reproduce the main changes of the map during crystallization and provide continuous deformation pathways representative of the crystallization dynamics.

### A colloidal viewpoint on the sausage catastrophe and the finite sphere packing problem [^cc9a8986]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

It is commonly believed that the most efficient way to pack a finite number of equal-sized spheres is by arranging them tightly in a cluster. However, mathematicians have conjectured that a linear arrangement may actually result in the densest packing. Here, our combined experimental and simulation study provides a physical realization of the finite sphere packing problem by studying arrangements of colloids in a flaccid lipid vesicle. We map out a state diagram displaying linear, planar, and cluster conformations of spheres, as well as bistable states which alternate between cluster-plate and plate-linear conformations due to membrane fluctuations. Finally, by systematically analyzing truncated polyhedral packings, we identify clusters of 56 ≤ N ≤ 70 number of spheres, excluding N = 57 and 63, that pack more efficiently than linear arrangements.

### High-order elastic multipoles as colloidal atoms [^2259f524]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Figure 9a–f shows the spherical multipole coefficientsas a function of the interpolation sphere position d i. As first example, we present a spherical particle with homeotropic anchoring on the surface (Fig. 9a), which has the director structure of an elastic quadrupole, commonly known as the Saturn ring configuration. Figure 9b shows that dipole moment is zero, quadrupole is constant regardless of d i, whereas all higher multipole moments are present nonetheless with their magnitudes dependent on d i. Notably, if the center of the interpolation sphere coincides with the geometrical center of the colloidal particle, the multipole coefficients have an extreme or zero, which actually one would expect, and supports the relevance of the geometrical center as the location of the multipoles. Note that higher multipole moments emerge primarily because the particle is positioned away from the center of the simulation box (in which we calculate the Q tensor profile) and the confinement distorts the exact quadrupolar symmetry of n (r). As second example, a spherical particle with conic degenerate anchoring is presented (Fig. 9c, d). The quadrupole coefficient is observed to be constant for all d i; however, other higher multipole coefficients emerge as well and are again dependent on the interpolation sphere position. But, interestingly, again, when the center of the interpolation sphere coincides with the geometrical center of the colloidal sphere at d i = − r a, all multipoles higher than 16-pole drop to zero. This again supports the relevance of geometric center as a reasonable position for the center of the interpolation sphere in determining the multipole coefficient. Nevertheless, less clearly, Fig. 9e, f shows the multipole coefficients of a composite colloidal particle with upper sphere radius r b = 2/5 r a and at position d b = 0. The quadrupolar moment is constant over all positions of the interpolation sphere, but higher multipoles emerge as well, and notably without clear signature at the geometrical center (such as zero value or maximum/minimum). This result shows that although our use of the geometrical center of particle works well over a range of regimes of particle shapes and anchoring types, as it corresponds exactly to the location of the multipoles, in general, it is only a reasonable approximation. Another example of systems where only geometrical arguments for finding location of multipole centers will fail are (symmetric) colloids (even spheres) with different anchoring strengths (and/or anchoring types) on different parts of the colloidal surface. Overall, this indicates an interesting possible further study, such as if and how, different multipoles of one particle could possibly emerge at different mutually shifted locations.

### Convergent and divergent genes expression profiles associated with brain-wide functional connectome dysfunction in deficit and non-deficit schizophrenia [^21a73105]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Transcription-neuroimaging association analysis

To establish the stable sample correspondence between gene expression and neuroimaging data, we defined three radius spheres (4 mm, 6 mm, and 8 mm) centered at the MNI coordinate of each tissue sample and extracted the mean value on each aforementioned MA-value map of FC differences. Then, for each module, we calculated Pearson's correlation between the ME and the MA-value across brain tissue samples. Multiple comparisons were corrected using the FDR method (q < 0.05). To control the effect of radius spheres, the significant gene modules must be significant at all three radius spheres. Based on the significant positive and negative correlations between the ME and the MA-value in brain tissue samples, we define genes in modules as the positive and negative correlation genes. Then based on the results of correlation analyses, we first intersected the positive and negative correlation genes of 4 brain parcellations. Furthermore, to make sure the genes were from brain tissue and were associated with SCZ, we calculated the genes that intersected the SCZ genes expressed in brain tissue in the A Database for Schizophrenia Genetic Research (SZDB). We obtained DS-related genes associated with FC alterations and NDS-related genes associated with FC alterations. Finally, we calculate the overlapped positive and negative regulation genes between DS and NDS. Furthermore, to identify key genes associated DS and NDS, we also calculated Pearson's correlation between the positive and negative regulation gene expressions of overlapped genes and non-overlapped genes, respectively. We defined the genes with correlation values greater than 0.7 as identified key genes.

Enrichment analysis

Enrichment analysis for identified key genes of overlapped genes between DS and NDS was mainly performed by the clusterProfiler4.0: R software package, including the Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and Disease Ontology analysis (DO) databases. We also showed these key genes expression differences in SCZ patients compared with healthy controls from SZDB when genes were enriched in function, pathway or disease.

### A colloidal viewpoint on the sausage catastrophe and the finite sphere packing problem [^33c5286b]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

In conclusion, our study sheds new light on the finite sphere packing problem and provides valuable insights on the most efficient methods for packing a finite number of spheres in a closed, flexible container. We demonstrate that a low-tension vesicle can serve as a model system for studying linear, planar, and cluster configurations formed by a small number of colloidal hard spheres. By constructing a general state diagram based on a single-order parameter describing the reduced volume of the vesicle, we can differentiate between stable and bistable states, and demonstrate how for such systems a linear arrangement of colloids always presents a better packing than other configurations. Our simulation predictions are consistent with the experimental observations. Beyond addressing the finite sphere packing problem, our findings have broader applications. For instance, the encapsulation of a limited number of spheres within a vesicle provides a strategy for pre-assembling building blocks that could be used to construct larger, more intricate structures, with potential applications such as the enhancement of plasmonic properties in metamaterials. Moreover, our methodology can be adapted to other building blocks like dimers, trimers, or tetramers, drawing inspiration from existing techniques that use patchy interactions or emulsion methods to realize these clusters.

### Interaction of functional brain networks is associated with k-clique percolation in the human structural connectome [^340c6533]. Human Brain Mapping (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3 The Edge Confidence

To quantify the reliability of connections across subjects, we used an edge confidence measure, similar to the methodology proposed in (Szalkai et al.). The weight of an edge was calculated as its probability of occurrence across the entire set of networks. This approach helps to distinguish between common connections in the brain network and more individual‐specific ones.

2.4 Network Decomposition and Inverse Decomposition

To investigate how structural properties depend on edge confidence, we used two complementary approaches: network decomposition and inverse decomposition. In network decomposition, we applied a cutoff thresholdfor edge confidence, removing all links with weights below this threshold. Conversely, in inverse decomposition, we removed connections with weights greater than or equal to a threshold, allowing us to analyze subgraphs of weak (individual) links. The network decomposition and inverse decomposition techniques allow analyzing how different structural properties shape the organization of the connectome.

2.5 Network Model of High‐Order Clique Formation

We developed a generative model to examine whether high‐order‐clique percolation can arise under anatomical constraints of human connectomes. The model can be viewed as a modification of exponential random graph models under metric constraints. We initialize the system as a random graph with 100 nodes and 1000 edges, parameters selected to approximate the average edge density observed across empirical connectomes. Each node is placed randomly but uniformly within a unit‐radius sphere inEuclidean space. The positions of nodes are fixed throughout the simulation, establishing a stable anatomical embedding in which edge lengths correspond to Euclidean distances. This framework enables us to apply connection‐length constraints, reflecting the biological cost of long‐range axonal projections.

The network then evolves through an edge‐rewiring process that increases the frequency of triangular motifs, driving local clustering while preserving both the number of nodes and the total number of edges (i.e. constant network size and density). Edge rewiring was implemented as a stochastic process guided by network transitivity. At each iteration, a randomly selected edge is rewired, and the new network configuration is accepted according to one of two criteria: (1) if the new transitivity is greater than the current one (i.e.); or (2) via a Metropolis‐like condition governed by a chemical potential parameter:

### Relationship between rheology and structure of interpenetrating, deforming and compressing microgels [^e59c3230]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Edge detection and contour smoothing of particles imaged by dSTORM

Our goal now is to obtain a faithful contour of each particle and use it for measuring different geometric features such as the particle area, area overlap and deformations. To this end we must first segment the image, that is separate the particle from the background and determine the boundary. There are several methods in image analysis to accomplish this, all with their advantages and pitfalls. More sophisticated methods involve gradients or Laplacians of the image. What characterizes an edge is a sharp change in intensity, making derivatives well suited to capture their locations. We use the Laplacian of Gaussian edge detector in Matlab (MathWorks, Inc. USA), which allows for edges to be selected based on their strength, and not on image intensity values. It also produces closed contours without branching, unlike methods based solely on thresholding. The Laplacian of Gaussian edge detection consists of the following steps: first the image is smoothed by convolution with a Gaussian kernel, then the Laplacian (second derivative in 2D) is calculated and finally the zero-crossings are found which correspond to edges. Examples for the image segmentation done with this method, starting from a dSTORM image of a typical round and a more compressed and deformed particle are shown in Supplementary Fig. 8. The two particles also display different intensities (i.e. density of blinking events detected), yet we can see that the overall shapes and sizes are well captured, with a decrease in size and deformations clearly visible for the second example. Nonetheless, the presence of significant roughness of the contour remains an obstacle in characterizing shape deformations. Visual inspection of the original deformed particle image clearly suggest five corners and nearly flat facets and this are the features to isolate by image analysis. In order to smooth the particle contours while maintaining the prominent shape features we need to eliminate small scale shape fluctuations without significantly altering the overall larger scale shape and corners. To this end we use the method of Fourier descriptors, which has been used for a variety of applications involving image analysis. By taking the Fourier transform of the contour different spatial frequencies can be separated, then, by appropriate filtering, a smoothed contour can be retrieved and used as a starting point for further analysis. First, coordinates of the boundary pixels with respect to the particle′s center of mass are extracted from the segmented image and ordered counterclockwise. We thus obtain a discrete curve [x j, y j] with j = 1. N where N is the number of pixels. Then, the coordinates are transformed into complex numbers as z j = x j + iy j. Now the Fourier descriptors Z (k) are calculated using a discrete Fourier transform

### A novel method for calculating the volume of hemangiomas [^69cc393b]. Pediatric Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Accurately measuring the size of infantile hemangiomas is critical for objectively quantifying their growth, involution, and treatment response. Volumetric measurements are particularly appropriate because hemangiomas tend to mark out their territory early on and then grow and involute volumetrically. To our knowledge, only two publications have proposed bedside methods for measuring hemangioma volume. In these two publications, the authors modeled hemangiomas as perfect spheres or half-spheres, but many hemangiomas more closely approximate ellipsoids, with each of their axes in three dimensions having different, rather than equal, lengths. We present an alternative bedside method for calculating hemangioma volume, using a formula derived with calculus requiring only three bedside measurements using a disposable paper tape measure.

### Collective self-caging of active filaments in virtual confinement [^bccb7584]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Minimal model & mechanism

To confirm that the formation of the ring is not due to some hidden active re-orientation at the boundary, we replicate this collective behavior in simulations of an active filament model (Fig. 1 e and Supplementary Movie 3). In the spirit of previous works. filaments are composed of beads connected by springs with typical rest length σ /2, capable of gliding on the 2D plane and interacting only via repulsion (schematic in Fig. 3 b). We use a soft harmonic potential that allows for partial overlap between filaments, reminiscent of the experiments where bacteria may cross each other (compare Fig. 1 d). Below, it will turn out that this feature is essential for the collective aggregation at the light boundary. Scotophobic responses are implemented by reversing the gliding direction of the filament once its foremost bead enters the dark. Hence, no torque or rotation of the body is applied. The length distribution of filaments is chosen similar to the experiment (Appendix Fig. S1). The active filament model behaves remarkably similar to the cyanobacteria, showing accumulation at and alignment with the inner boundary of the illuminated disk (color code in Fig. 1 e). We find that this behavior is quite robust against changes in the model parameters. Simulation results thus confirm that the ring formation happens without imposing alignment or torques at the boundary, rendering it a purely emergent effect induced by the interactions between the filaments. Kymographs of density and nematic order (see Appendix Figs. S3 & S4) are comparable to the experiments.

Both the top and bottom hemispheres are shown separately. b The equirectangular projection of the vesicle in (a) at t = 30 min where the four +1/2 defects are indicated with parabolic symbols. Scale bars indicate 10 μm. c Trajectories of the four +1/2 defects on a globally jammed vesicle. Time is color-coded; the total time is 60 min.

At any given time, the positions of the four +1/2 defects can also be described by θ i j, which denotes the angle between radii from the vesicle center to each of the six defect pairs, i j. For a tetrahedral configuration, the mean pair angle 〈 θ i j 〉 = 109.5° and for a planer configuration 〈 θ i j 〉 = 120°. It has been demonstrated in an active nematic vesicle that the four +1/2 defects repeatedly oscillate between the tetrahedral and planar configurations and the frequency is set by the activity of the component and the size of the sphere. In contrast, the four defects in the globally jammed vesicle (Fig. 5 a) evolve very slowly and as a consequence, the mean pair angle 〈 θ i j 〉 does not oscillate and stays stable over time (Fig. 5 e). This stable defect configuration is due to the reduction of activity of actin filaments when arrested in a globally jammed state on a sphere. Whether a band or a jammed state form is thus entirely dependent on which way the system chooses to accommodate the fundamental requirement on the total charge. As this four-defect configuration is more likely to form, globally jammed patterns and not bands are the dominant ones at high density and underline the influence a spherical topology can have in shaping collective patterns in this system.

### Designing highly efficient interlocking interactions in anisotropic active particles [^e0baceb3]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

In this manuscript we investigated the clustering behavior of self-propelled particles with a shape that is continuously tunable along a single anisotropy dimension by exploiting a combination of 3D printing and simulations. Printing bent rods with different opening angles allowed connecting our results with the two major shapes thus far employed, spheres and rods. Surprisingly, stable interlocking into pairs occurs at arbitrarily low number concentrations of particles due to a interlocking type interaction. Pair formation plays a critical role in nucleation, and the dynamics of the fraction of clustered particles can thus be captured with a notably simple formula which allows rescaling of the clustering dynamics into a single master curve. We find that particle shape influences both the assembly speed and cluster size distribution with an optimum for crescents with an 180° opening angle and can be described by a competition between interlocking and break-up.

Our experimental and numerical results provide the first detailed understanding on how a gradual shape change from a sphere to a rod affects the clustering behavior of active particles and uncover a simple yet general description for this complex effect. These key insights are important to understand how non-spherical shapes affect biological swimmers, and can be leveraged to further design interlocking type connections between active particles to control the stability of complex self-assembling structures through the depth of their entangling sites independent of their composition and surface chemistry. This strategy offers the unprecedented opportunity to design hierarchical assembly pathways towards active functional materials through engineering the active particle shape. The guaranteed assembly even at extremely low concentrations together with the interlocking shape recognition furthermore opens up possibilities in the drug delivery where site recognition or a low concentration of the drug-carriers as well as the activation of reactants after assembly is important. In the future, it will be interesting to study the cross-over from our low-density system which exhibits motility induced clustering of mostly small clusters to a system with higher surface area density where larger clusters with different assembly dynamics and motility induced phase separation (MIPS) may occur.

### EANM practice guideline for quantitative SPECT-CT [^6d3e3304]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Reconstruction

Iterative methods are recommended to reconstruct the acquired SPECT projections. Normally, the algorithm used will be that included in the software provided by the vendor of the gamma camera; however, third-party algorithms are also available. For quantitative purposes, the number of updates, defined by the product of the number of iterations and subsets, may be greater than for reconstructions with qualitative purposes. Preferably, that number should be obtained from phantom measurements in which the convergence of activity concentration is studied, paying attention not to reach excessive noise levels or introduce image artefacts, such as Gibbs artefacts from the use of resolution modelling. Ideally, such optimisation should be performed using anthropomorphic phantoms which mimic the clinical situation, but such phantoms are not always available. If NEMA IEC IQ or Jaszczak phantoms are used as part of the optimisation process, it should be noted that SPECT recovery curves are far more dependent on sphere position than PET. This is likely due to the variable detector radius acquisition resulting from auto-contouring and so it is recommended that multiple sphere configurations are evaluated. Figure 2 shows an example of how the variability of ACR can be aligned across different sphere configurations when sufficient updates are performed.

Fig. 2
NEMA IEC image quality phantom filled with 99m Tc at 10:1 contrast in three different sphere configurations reconstructed with 3 iterations and 6 subsets (upper set of images) and 20 iterations and 6 subsets (lower set of images). The corresponding recovery curves are given below for maximum voxel ACR. Note that all phantom images shown have corrections for attenuation, scatter and collimator response included and a 10 mm Gaussian filter applied

Corrections

Attenuation correction

Attenuation correction based on CT data should be used for quantitative SPECT-CT. The CT images should be converted to a map of attenuation coefficients for the appropriate radionuclide energy and incorporated into the iterative reconstruction process. It must also be possible to measure the full path length of the gamma-ray from the point of emission to the patient boundary on the attenuation map. If the attenuation map is truncated, either by way of large patient habitus or inadequate CT field of view, then the attenuation correction will not be accurate and quantitative errors will occur. Hence, care should be taken when positioning the patient to minimise the likelihood of truncation. Where appropriate, and when available, it is recommended to use metal artefact correction algorithms to produce more suitable attenuation maps.

### Clustering by measuring local direction centrality for data with heterogeneous density and weak connectivity [^8e494dc8]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

DCM calculation in high-dimensional space

DCM calculation requires to map the KNNs onto the unit hyperspherical surface drawn by their center point firstly, then subdivides the hyperspherical surface and measures the generalized angles of each subdivision unit. In 2D space, KNNs are mapped onto a unit circle. They subdivide the circle into multiple arcs and each arc corresponds to a central angle. DCM measures the variance of these angles. While in 3D space, KNNs are mapped onto a unit spherical surface. They connect neighboring points to form a spherical triangulation and DCM is extended as the variance of the solid angles of the triangles. For subdividing a hyperspherical surface in a higher-dimensional space, we adopt Qhull algorithmto construct the convex complex of KNNs. Since all the KNNs have been mapped onto the hyperspherical surface, they are guaranteed to be the vertices of the convex complex (Repeat KNNs are not included). In d -dimensional space, each facet of the convex complex is a (d- 1)-simplex and corresponds to a subdivision unit (Simplex here denotes the simplest figure that contains d + 1 given points in d -dimensional space and that does not lie in a space of lower dimension). For instances, a 2D and 3D convex complex consists of multiple line segments (1-simplex) and triangles (2-simplex), which subdivides the circle and spherical surface into arcs and spherical triangles respectively (Supplementary Fig. 8).

After subdividing, the generalized angles could be measured. Natively, the angles are equivalent to volumes of the corresponding subdivision units (e.g. arc length in 2D circle, area of the spherical triangle in 3D sphere). However, it is difficult to calculate the volumes of subdivision units in high-dimensional space due to the computational complexity of multiple integral. Therefore, we measure the volume of each simplices and then allocate the global volume error to each subdivision unit evenly for an approximate calculation. Although there are errors between the true and calculated volumes of subdivision units, thesort orders based on the two kinds of volumes are the same, since the volumes of subdivision units increase monotonically with the corresponding simplices. Thus, athreshold can be searched to distinguish the internal and boundary points effectively.

### Early-stage bifurcation of crystallization in a sphere [^7ecbd6f9]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Here, we study the role of thermodynamics and kinetics for bifurcation in colloidal crystallization. Colloidal particles are a classical model system for condensed matter to study phase transitions and structure formation. The large size of colloidal particles allows both the direct observation of crystal structures via optical microscopyand to follow the crystallization pathways in situ via structural coloration. Colloidal particles are also appealing because the complex atomic interactions can be reduced to hard sphere-like repulsion, which is well suited for computer simulation. And while the phase behavior of hard spheres is dominated by entropy, the hard sphere model retains complex nucleation pathways, including polymorphism. The analogy between atoms and colloids can be transferred to finite clusters by confining colloidal particles within an emulsion droplet –. Similar to nanoparticles, colloidal clusters favor icosahedral symmetry over the bulk fcc structure, and feature magic number configurations with closed-shell structures as free energy minima. In this contribution, we report the experimental observation of decahedral colloidal clusters. We show that thermodynamics is not sufficient to explain the outcomes of experiments. Instead, kinetic factors are important. Finally, we introduce a simple geometric argument that explains the dominance of icosahedral colloidal clusters found in experiment by considering the shape of the growing nucleus.

### The structural origin of the hard-sphere glass transition in granular packing [^6a11d64a]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The main conclusion of the current study is that quasi-regular tetrahedra are the structural elements of glass order in weakly polydisperse hard-sphere glass-particle systems. The order grows by following an entropy-driven nucleation process which is reminiscent of the diffusion limited cluster aggregation (DLCA) in kinetic gelation process, where independent clusters following DLCA growth processes touch in forming a global percolating fractal structure and acquire mechanical rigidity suddenly. The fact that the growth is correlated can therefore induce cooperativity and non-Arrhenius behaviour in the system.

Similar to the gelation process in systems with attractive interactions, we suggest that the jamming transition corresponds to a rigidity percolation transition of glass order for systems with repulsive interactions, that is, at RCP, the percolated polytetrahedral clusters acquire an infinite mechanical correlation length abruptly. The fractal shape of the percolated polytetrahedral order could therefore be related to the marginal solid behaviourand unique scaling behaviours of the jamming transition. Our jamming transition picture therefore suggests a unified scenario for rigidity transitions in systems with attractive or purely repulsive interactions: both are driven by the rigidity percolation of an underlying glass order.

The above percolation mechanism of jamming transition can also provide a simple geometric explanation of the continuous range of jamming density (the J-line) observed in numerical simulations. In our system, the highest packing density we can theoretically achieve is ∼0.64, which corresponds to the RCP state. Interestingly, the RCP state has a non-zero entropy and consists of many polytetrahedral clusters, and therefore is not the ideal glass state. At RCP, the average internal packing fraction of each cluster is approximately 0.67, which suggests that the rather low global packing fraction originates from the existence of cluster boundaries. As a result, if we can extrapolate the configurational entropy towards zero in obtaining a single large polytetrahedron spanning the whole system, that is, the jammed ideal glass state or GCP, then in principle, we can obtain a jammed packing density ∼0.67. Interestingly, this is exactly the upper limit of the J-line as has been predicted by the simulations.

### The 3D analysis of the sagittal curvature of the femoral trochlea in the Chinese population [^825cdf28]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

An unnatural design of the sagittal geometry of the femoral trochlea may cause abnormal patellofemoral kinematics and complications after knee arthroplasty. Most previous studies examined the sagittal curvature of the femoral trochlea on 2D parasagittal planes, which may not represent the true sagittal curvature of the complex 3D femoral trochlea.

Methods

The current study evaluated the sagittal geometry of the femoral trochlea of 100 healthy Chinese subjects (50 women and 50 men) with 3D analysis. A close-fit sphere was generated on the surface of the medial and lateral trochlear articular surface, respectively. The radii of the spheres represented the sagittal radii of the femoral trochlear sagittal curvature. A cylinder was then established and its radius was adjusted to allow the deepest points of the curved trochlear groove touching the cylindrical surface. The radius of the cylinder represented the sagittal radius of the trochlear groove.

Results

In the men, the average radii of the curvature of the femoral trochlea were 18.8 ± 2.5 mm and 25.5 ± 2.8 mm for the medial and lateral femoral trochleas, respectively. In the women, the average radii of the curvature of the femoral trochlea were 20.2 ± 3.0 mm and 26.6 ± 2.7 mm for the medial and lateral femoral trochleas, respectively. The average radius of the cylinder of the trochlea groove was 19.6 ± 2.0 mm with a circular arc of 123.2° ± 13.0° in the men. In the women, the radius was 20.2 ± 1.7 mm with a circular arc of 127.9° ± 11.7°.

Conclusion

The present study provided a reliable and consistent assessment of the sagittal geometry of the femoral trochlea in the Chinese population. The results of the current study may be helpful to improve the understanding of the knee kinematics and develop the physiological knee prostheses.

### Lattice-free prediction of three-dimensional structure of programmed DNA assemblies [^738946ea]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Topologically closed DNA assemblies

To test the ability of our procedure to be applied to topologically closed DNA assemblies that cannot be modelled using our previous finite element approach, we first applied it to a concentric ring structure consisting of four rings designed to reside in a 2D plane with circumferences of 100, 150, 200 and 250 bps, respectively, with inner diameter of 11 nm and outer diameter of 26 nm (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Movie 2). The outer diameter was also measured using atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Supplementary Fig. 11). Although the overall equilibrium 3D structure remained planar, individual helices adopted straightened configurations intervening neighbouring four-way junctions to minimize overall mechanical free energy. In contrast, application of the model to a scaffolded DNA origami structure consisting of nine concentric rings, previously designed and analyzed experimentally using AFM, exhibited significant out-of-plane distortion in addition to in-plane duplex bulging despite the absence of any electrostatic repulsion between neighbouring helices (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Movie 3). Application to a 12-layer hemispherical origami object with outer diameter 44 nm revealed an overall hemispherical structure together with similar local distortions in concentric rings, in addition to a slightly collapsed upper quadrant(Fig. 2c and Supplementary Movie 4). Our procedure also simulated structural flexibility and thermal fluctuations of these three structures (Supplementary Movies 5–7). These subtle structural features predicted by the model are postulated to have origins in the mismatch in length between intervening DNA duplexes between concentric rings. In particular, our model assumes a 1.85 nm interhelical distance at four-way junctions to be consistent with atomic-level junction models, compared with the 2.5 nm assumed previously to design the contour length of each concentric ring(Supplementary Fig. 8, Supplementary Table 1, and Supplementary Note 4). Differences in the designed radii of two perfectly concentric rings also therefore equals 2.5 nm, leading to contour lengths of 200 and 250 bps of the outermost two layers in the four-layer ring, for example, assuming a 0.34 nm axial rise per bp and an inner ring diameter of 22 nm. This resulting mismatch in contour length consequently leads to the five bulges between two neighbouring immobile four-way junctions in the outermost two layers, as well as the increased curvature in the outermost layer in the four-layer ring. We further assume a ground-state junction angle J twist = 60° corresponding to the free immobile four-way junction, which may further exaggerate this effect. Because the precise pattern of bulging of neighbouring helices and slight collapse observed in the model cannot be resolved experimentally using AFM or transmission electron microscopy, it is impossible at present to determine whether the detailed patterns of predicted local bulging are valid, and if so, whether they are due only to contour mismatch, assumed ground-state junction angle, electrostatic repulsion or some combination of these effects. Notwithstanding, high-resolution 3D structural data from cryo-electron microscopy will be of interest in the future to test these subtle structural predictions for the present, as well as other, programmed DNA assemblies.

### Indentation probing of human articular cartilage: effect on chondrocyte viability [^32a903c8]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical arthroscopic probes based on indentation testing are being developed. However, the biological effects of certain design parameters (i.e., tip geometry and size) and loading protocols (i.e., indentation depth, rate, and repetition) on human articular cartilage are unclear.

Objective

Determine if indenter design and indentation protocol modulate mechanical injury of probed cartilage samples.

Methods

The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of indentation testing using clinically applicable tips (0.4mm radius, plane- or sphere-ended) and protocols (indentation depths of 100, 200, or 300 microm, applied at a rate of 50 or 500 microm/s) on the extent and the pattern of chondrocyte death, should it occur. Grossly normal osteochondral blocks were harvested from human talar dome, indented, stained with live/dead dyes, and imaged en face on a fluorescence microscope.

Results

The occurrence and the extent of cell death generally increased with indentation depth, being undetected at an indentation depth of 100 microm but marked at 300 microm. In addition, tip geometry affected the pattern of cell death: ring- and solid circle-shaped areas of cell deaths were apparent when compressed to 300 microm using plane- and sphere-ended indenters.

Conclusion

Indenter design and indentation protocol modulated the extent and the pattern of chondrocyte death. These results have implications for designing indentation probes and protocols, as well as clinicians performing arthroscopic probing.

Similarly, the average area of the observed glomeruli on one section in the biopsied specimen is estimated as follows:

We assume that glomeruli less than 5 micrometers in diameter cannot be counted. A sphere 2r in diameter is cut off at both ends in parallel so that the diameter of a section may be set to 2r o (5 μm). We observe only circles parallel to the section of this solid, whose height is defined as 2 h. Considering a 2 h-high cylinder whose volume is equal to this solid, the cylindrical base area is equal to the average cross-sectional area of this solid cut at random parallel to the base of the solid (Figure 6).

where A h is the average rea of the observed circle. Hence, A h is estimated by:

Using the Pythagorean theorem,

Where r is the glomerular radius and r o is the cut-off value of the observed glomerular radius (Figure 6).

Substituting h with a function of r and r o gives:

A cortex_s (Area of the cortex of the section in a biopsied specimen) is calculated as:

Where d b is the internal diameter of the biopsy needle and L a+b is "a + b" in Figure 5 for the total cortex length in biopsied specimens.

VF glom/cortex (Volume fraction of glomeruli/cortex) is equal to AF glom/cortex (Area fraction of glomeruli/cortex on the section).

Where N s is the number of observed glomeruli in a biopsied specimen.

Finally, the total number of glomeruli (N total) was calculated as:

Where V cortex is the volume of the cortex estimated by MRI.

In this study, the value of r will be decided after calculating the means of approximately 5% of the attending patients by random sampling. Therefore, "r" is not a variable in the final calculation.

### Mean-field theory of random close packings of axisymmetric particles [^90ce5be7]. Nature Communications (2013). Medium credibility.

Finding the optimal random packing of non-spherical particles is an open problem with great significance in a broad range of scientific and engineering fields. So far, this search has been performed only empirically on a case-by-case basis, in particular, for shapes like dimers, spherocylinders and ellipsoids of revolution. Here we present a mean-field formalism to estimate the packing density of axisymmetric non-spherical particles. We derive an analytic continuation from the sphere that provides a phase diagram predicting that, for the same coordination number, the density of monodisperse random packings follows the sequence of increasing packing fractions: spheres < oblate ellipsoids < prolate ellipsoids < dimers < spherocylinders. We find the maximal packing densities of 73.1% for spherocylinders and 70.7% for dimers, in good agreement with the largest densities found in simulations. Moreover, we find a packing density of 73.6% for lens-shaped particles, representing the densest random packing of the axisymmetric objects studied so far.

Introduction

Nontrivial 3D topology has inspired many descriptions of fundamental particles. Motivated by Lord Kelvin's knotted vortex atom hypothesis, Tony Skyrmein 1961 proposed a topological model for nuclei: particle-like continuous fields in 3D space now called skyrmions. These map 3D real space to the hypersphere (i.e. the unit sphere in four dimensions, also known as the 3-sphere,), parametrising the field. The skyrmion configuration wraps around the hypersphere an integer number of times called the Skyrme number. Skyrmions are now seen as a particular example of more general 3D topological solitons –, related to other topological textures such as monopoles and hopfions — the latter being fields with a 2-sphere parameter space (i.e. unit sphere in three dimensions). 3D topological textures have been studied theoretically as hypothetical objects in various systems, including high-energy physics, condensed matter, and early-universe cosmology. In recent years, 3D skyrmions and hopfions have been experimentally realised in cold quantum matter, and liquid crystals.

So-called baby skyrmions are the two-dimensional (2D) counterpart of 3D skyrmions: fields in 2D physical space which map to, and wrap around, a 2-sphere parameter space. Their study is much more developed in theory and experiments, notably in non-singular superfluid vorticesincluding those imprinted by structured light, and especially magnetic systems. Here the direction of spin at each point provides the 2-sphere parameter space, and magnetic skyrmion excitations have the potential to represent topological bits for low-power computer memory and processing. Recently, 2D baby skyrmion configurations were created in optical systems, as the direction of electric field vectors, or photon spin, near a material interface, displaying dynamics similar to magnetic skyrmions. In propagating laser light, optical polarisation can be structured into full Poincaré beams, which realise every state of elliptic polarisation in the transverse plane. These beams can also be interpreted as 2D baby skyrmions, since the Poincaré sphere, as the 2-sphere parameter space, parametrises transverse, elliptic polarisation states. However, 3D particle-like topological objects have not been considered either theoretically or experimentally in optical fields.

### Magnetic flux lines in type-II superconductors and the 'hairy ball'theorem [^022ece25]. Nature Communications (2010). Medium credibility.

Many prominent phenomena originate from geometrical effects rather than from local physics. For example, the 'hairy ball' (HB) theorem asserts that a hairy sphere cannot be combed without introducing at least one singularity, and is fulfilled by the atmospheric circulation with the existence of stratospheric polar vortices and the fact that there is always at least one place on Earth where the horizontal wind is still. In this study, we examine the consequences of the HB theorem for the lattice of flux lines that form when a magnetic field is applied to a type-II superconducting crystal. We find that discontinuities must exist in lattice shape as a function of field direction relative to the crystal. Extraordinary, 'unconventional' flux line lattice shapes that spontaneously break the underlying crystal symmetry are thus remarkably likely across all type-II superconductors, both conventional and unconventional.

### Empirical models of transverse relaxation for spherical magnetic perturbers [^ff9d77dc]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2003). Low credibility.

Ferromagnetic or superparamagnetic particles as MRI contrast agent present many advantages for bringing about soft tissue contrast as compared to single-ion complexes. The classic microscopic outersphere theory that works successfully for small molecules in understanding the transverse relaxation rate 1/T(2) is not valid for these larger and stronger magnetic spheres. We categorize the relaxation behavior of the tissue-sphere system for ferromagnetic spherical perturbers in five diffusion regimes. Over the entire range of perturber size a general understanding of the relaxation mechanisms is described in terms of basic physical features of the system, and, through empiric models, the imaging sequences of spin echo and gradient echo. The models are verified with results of our spectroscopic measurements as well as simulations and experiments in the literature. Normalized models, obtained through proper scaling of the sphere radius and the relaxation rate, can be used to quantitatively estimate 1/T(2) for various combinations of the variables. Effects of diffusion upon image contrast and effects of sphere size change upon relaxation with their possible applications in microvascular dilatation and other areas are then discussed.

### Pushing the resolution limit by correcting the ewald sphere effect in single-particle cryo-EM reconstructions [^a23aff11]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

The Ewald sphere effect is generally neglected when using the Central Projection Theorem for cryo electron microscopy single-particle reconstructions. This can reduce the resolution of a reconstruction. Here we estimate the attainable resolution and report a "block-based" reconstruction method for extending the resolution limit. We find the Ewald sphere effect limits the resolution of large objects, especially large viruses. After processing two real datasets of large viruses, we show that our procedure can extend the resolution for both datasets and can accommodate the flexibility associated with large protein complexes.

### Passive appendages generate drift through symmetry breaking [^40d5e9f2]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Numerical simulations of a two-dimensional body

We discretize the two-dimensional incompressible Navier–Stokes equations with a staggered-grid, finite-volume formulation using a second-order semi-implicit time integration scheme. The no-slip boundary condition is enforced at Lagrangian points by appropriate regularized surface forces. A uniform grid size of h = 1/25 dimensionless length units is sufficient to reproduce previous workon freely falling circular cylinder in terms of trajectory. The dimensionless length is the diameter of the cylinder, D. The equations for the motion of the rigid body are coupled to fluid solver implicitly. This ensures numerical stability at density ratios between solid and fluid as low as ρ s / ρ f = 1.0001. The resulting linear equation system is solved using approximation of block-LU decompositionand direct solver. The freely falling cylinder with the splitter plate is placed in a large computational box with no-slip boundary conditions imposed at the walls. The box dimensions depend on the duration of transient behaviour; typical size used is 40 D in width and 110 D in height. A uniform cartesian grid covers a large region, typical size is 20 D wide and 90 D high. In the region between the uniform mesh and domain boundary, the mesh is expanded smoothly. The no-slip boundary condition at the box wall is always at least 10 D away from the body. The time-dependent simulation is continued until it reaches a terminal motion. The angle of drift is obtained using linear regression of the trajectory in the terminal regime. The obtained angle is compared with corresponding simulation of the cylinder alone, using the same mesh and the same initial conditions. The cylinder alone has a small drift (around 0.3 degrees) due to boundary effects. To increase the accuracy, we subtract the unphysical drift from the results of cylinder with splitter plate for all lengths. The angle of splitter-plate orientation is determined as a mean over terminal regime.

### Comparing accuracies of length-type geographic atrophy growth rate metrics using atrophy-front growth modeling [^6d008c34]. Ophthalmology Science (2022). Medium credibility.

Although the mathematical formulation and numerical implementation of our growth model is somewhat complex, our model's conceptual underpinning is relatively parsimonious. Indeed, the atrophy front growth model of equation SI-2 (Appendix 1) is arguably the minimal model of an anisotropically evolving margin. Moreover, as noted previously, although independently derived, our growth model naturally leads to a notion of growth rate that is consistent with the previously proposed square-root-transformed and perimeter-adjusted growth rate metrics. We argue that this agreement lends support both to our model and to the use of these growth rate metrics. Nevertheless, given the relative intricacies of our model's formulation, it is reasonable to ask what advantages it offers compared with more informal or ad hoc statements of the margin-mediated growth hypothesis. In this regard, we believe that this study makes 2 substantive contributions: (1) our model leads to a precise biophysical statement as to what length-type growth rate metrics measure, something that is reasonably nuanced and not a priori evident, particularly for anisotropic lesion growths; and (2) our model allows quantitative assessments of length-type metric accuracies on realistic lesion geometries and growth patterns, something that is not possible with existing formulations. In particular, the accuracies of length-type metrics have been discussed previously only in the context of simple shapes (e.g. circles) and simple growth patterns (e.g. isotropic growth fields or infinitesimal time intervals, Δ t).

### Elevated olivine weathering rates and sulfate formation at cryogenic temperatures on mars [^810d1d8b]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Dissolution rate calculation

The measured solution compositions were converted into dissolution rates by using a disappearing sphere model for a situation where substantial dissolution is expected:

Where, n is the cumulative number of moles (Mg+Fe) released from a sphere of radius r, k is the rate of dissolution of the mineral in moles m −2 s −1, V is the molar volume of the mineral, t is the time of dissolution, S is the number of particles, and I is the correction factor to account for the atoms per formula unit (e.g. 0.5 for forsterite Mg 2 SiO 4). Initial sphere radius (r o) for olivine was calculated to be 8 μm assuming a log-normal distribution of particle sizes between 5 and 53 µm. S was calculated using the initial sphere radius (olivine particles) and the mass of the sample which did not include the silica spheres. Because Eq. (2) cannot be easily solved for k, a method of successive approximations was used to calculate the number of moles until it matched the experimental results to four significant digits. The final dissolution rate was calculated by averaging the rates calculated from the longest duration experiments (> 3 days). The rates were also corrected for results from blank experiments conducted with no olivine present. The blank experiment consisted of adding all of the materials except for the olivine and immediately adding the buffer solution and collecting the product (< 1 h total duration). The short duration blank did show a significant background level (above 1 µmol) of Mg and Fe (Supplementary Table 1). In addition, similar experiments run at 7 days length showed minimal additional contribution of Mg and Fe (~1 µmol) from silica spheres (Supplementary Table 4). Acid-free blanks (all materials except for acid) were also run using similar durations (Supplementary Table 3). Assuming 50 mg of olivine and 0.5 mL of 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 solution, we can calculate 0.25 mmol of H 2 SO 4 and 0.54 mol of olivine. As 2 mol of H 2 SO 4 are neutralized by 1 mol of olivine, the amount of olivine in the experiments is double the amount needed to neutralize the acid. This is consistent with what would be expected in natural systems, where the amount of silicate should overwhelm the available acidity.

### A complex sum method of quantifying susceptibilities in cylindrical objects: the first step toward quantitative diagnosis of small objects in MRI [^2cccec77]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2007). Low credibility.

A complex sum method of quantifying the magnetic susceptibility of a long, narrow cylinder embedded in a uniform medium has been developed. The radius of the cylinder can be as small as one pixel. The susceptibility inside the object is extracted from the magnetic resonance complex images, using two concentric circles around the axis of the cylinder. The numerical simulations of this complex sum method are in good agreement with the phantom studies. Specifically, the method was tested with a susceptibility difference of -9 ppm to mimic air/tissue interface in the human body at 1.5 T with an echo time of 5 ms. Phantom studies using an air-filled cylinder in a solidified gel have shown that the susceptibility of the gel cannot be determined by the usual least-squares-fit method but can be determined by the complex sum method to within 5–10% of the expected value.

### Superlattices assembled through shape-induced directional binding [^dd7e6f30]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Despite the conceptual simplicity of this approach for generating designed clusters, it is nontrivial to predict the requirements for the formation of extended, ordered 3D superlattices (Fig. 1). Indeed, the geometrical constraints imposed by shapesresult in a rich structural diversity even in monocomponent assemblies of shaped objects. Thus, it is not yet clear what dictates or inhibits the formation of large-scale ordered arrays even for the simplest case of hetero-shapes: mutually attractive spherical and shaped objects. At a general level, different particle shapes will exhibit significantly different anisotropic interactions in a system, thereby imposing conflicting local constraints that may override intended bonding directionality. Such conflicts can be resolved via complementary-shaped particles due to the favourable packing, certain shapes can be accommodated at the right size regimesor by optimizing a delicate balance of interactions and space-filling requirements. In our approach, the use of DNA permits tuning the interaction 'softness' due to DNA's polymeric nature. This allows us to probe the complex interplay between shape-induced directional binding, the interaction potential and geometrical requirements due to the particle size-ratios. As we show below, ordered assemblies of disparate shapes do not arise generically, even in the presence of well-defined directional bonds. Instead, crystals are obtained only with appropriate selection of interaction potentials and particle size ratio, in particular, those that satisfy local geometric constraints. Thus, directional bonds can be optimized to yield highly ordered binary 3D superlattices of hetero-shaped nanoparticles, wherein global crystallographic symmetry is directly selected by particle shape.

### Tracing multiple scattering trajectories for deep optical imaging in scattering media [^4bc9fcd5]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Proof of concept with numerical simulation

We performed numerical simulations to validate our proposed method of solving the inverse scattering problem (Fig. 3). Here, we consider a case where a target object is covered with multiple discrete phase plates whose phase functions are known a priori (Fig. 3a). Four phase plates are placed at depths ofμm, respectively, from the target object shown in the inset in Fig. 3a. The phase functionsof the four layers are shown in Fig. 3b. We set the size of each phase map as 200 × 200 μm 2, while that of the target object is set as 45 × 45 μm 2. Each phase map is filled with a random phase pattern to mimic a realistic scattering medium. In addition, different polygonal patterns and numbers are superimposed on each layer for ease of performance evaluation of the proposed algorithm (see Supplementary Section Numerical demonstration of MST algorithm with randomly patterned layers for the case of phase plates filled only with random phase patterns). Then, we numerically generate the reflection matrix R of the sample at a wavelength of 900 nm and an angular coverage of 1.0 NA based on Eq. (1).

### BIDCell: biologically-informed self-supervised learning for segmentation of subcellular spatial transcriptomics data [^fd824c9d]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

- Sphericity = where R I represents the radius of the inscribing circle, and R C represents the radius of the circumscribing circle.

Sphericity measures the rate at which an object approaches the shape of a sphere while accounting for the largest local irregularity of the cell by comparing the ratio of the radius largest circle that fits inside the cell (inscribing circle) to the radius of the smallest circle that contains the whole cell (circumscribing circle). The value is 1 for a sphere and decreases as the cell becomes less spherical.

- Compactness = where A represents the area, and P cell represents the cell perimeter.

Compactness measures the ratio of the area of an object to the area of a circle with the same perimeter. Compactness uses the perimeter of the cell thus it considers local irregularities in the cell perimeter. A circle will have a value of 1, and the less smooth or more irregular the perimeter of a cell, the smaller the value will be. For most cells the numerical values for compactness and circularity are expected to be similar. Identifying which cells have large differences between these metrics can identify cells with highly irregular perimeters which may be of interest for downstream analysis and quality control for segmentation.

- Convexity = where P convex represents the convex perimeter and P cell represents the cell perimeter.

Convexity measures the ratio of the convex perimeter of a cell to its perimeter. The value will be 1 for a circle and decrease the more irregular the perimeter of a cell becomes, similar to compactness.

- Eccentricity = where L minor represents the length of the minor axis and L major represents the length of the major axis.

Eccentricity (or ellipticity) measures the ratio of the major axis to the minor axis of a cell. The major axis is the longest possible line that can be drawn between the inner boundary of a cell without intersecting its boundary. The minor axis is the longest possible line can be drawn within the inner boundary of a cell while while also being perpendicular to the major axis. This gives a value of 1 for a circle and decreases the more flat the cell becomes.

### Rapid prediction of molecular crystal structures using simple topological and physical descriptors [^fcbaa22a]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Organic molecular crystals constitute a class of materials of critical importance in numerous industries. Despite the ubiquity of these systems, our ability to predict molecular crystal structures starting only from a two-dimensional diagram of the constituent compound(s) remains a significant challenge. Most structure-prediction protocols require a customized interatomic interaction model on which the quality of the results can depend sensitively. To overcome this problem, we introduce a new topological approach to molecular crystal structure prediction. The approach posits that in a stable structure, molecules are oriented such that principal axes and normal ring plane vectors are aligned with specific crystallographic directions and that heavy atoms occupy positions that correspond to minima of a set of geometric order parameters. By minimizing an objective function that encodes these orientations and atomic positions, and filtering based on the vdW free volume and intermolecular close contact distributions derived from the Cambridge Structural Database, stable structures and polymorphs for a given crystal can be predicted entirely mathematically without reliance on an interaction model.

### Universality in long-distance geometry and quantum complexity [^e343ca2d]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

This implies that we can approximate the operatorwith a total cost of about. This operator agrees with our target operatorat leading order in z, and has an inner-product error of about z 2. This can be improved to z 3 by using the next order in the Suzuki–Trotter expansion, but going to even higher orders becomes prohibitively expensive. It is at this point that we make our heuristic step. In the Euclidean group example, we saw that the complexity geometry has so many degrees of freedom that by making minor deformations of the path we can correct small errors at small extra cost, in a way that is not captured by any finite order of the Suzuki–Trotter expansion, and is instead an emergent feature in the IR. Compared with the SU(2) example in the section ' Berger sphere ', the task of compiling in U(2 N) is complicated by the fact that there are many more directions in which to err; on the other hand, there are correspondingly more directions in which we can wiggle the path to eliminate the error, and as a statistical matter, we expect that to dominate. If the small inner-product errors can be corrected by wiggling the path, then we can synthesizefor z < 1 at cost k n 2 (k). To generateat larger values of z, the triangle inequality (for any) guarantees that the complexity grows no faster than linearly with coefficient k n 2 (k). This argument heuristically shows that the binomial metric is in the same universality class as the infinite-cliff metric, and therefore upper-bounds the critical schedule:The upper-bound equation (17) holds at all but the largest k, where the analysis becomes unreliable. Note also that although the binomial metric does not have a curvature as small as the exponential metric, it is still very moderate ∣ κ ∣ ≤ O (N) compared to the cliff metric. The reasoning that leads to equation (17) is heuristic, because to eliminate error it appeals to a statistical argument. In ref. it is shown that there is a weaker result that can be proved. The study also shows that any unitary that can be reached with a path that in the binomial metric has a lengthcan be approximated to within inner-product error ϵ by a path that in the infinite-cliff metric has a lengthOur conjectures imply that this can be improved from polynomial to linear-with-additive-constant and from approximate to exact.

Starting with a minuscule imaginary part the real dynamics tends to infinity; yet when the real part gets sufficiently large (somewhat in the spirit of our computations above), the imaginary part takes over, grows rapidly, and chaperons the real part to the negative side. Once the real part reaches the opposite (absolutely equal) negative value, the imaginary part rapidly shrinks and the formerly bad, yet now benign real equation takes over again.

### A geometrically based method for automated radiosurgery planning [^2f2d214c]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2000). Low credibility.

Purpose

A geometrically based method of multiple isocenter linear accelerator radiosurgery treatment planning optimization was developed, based on a target's solid shape.

Methods and Materials

Our method uses an edge detection process to determine the optimal sphere packing arrangement with which to cover the planning target. The sphere packing arrangement is converted into a radiosurgery treatment plan by substituting the isocenter locations and collimator sizes for the spheres.

Results

This method is demonstrated on a set of 5 irregularly shaped phantom targets, as well as a set of 10 clinical example cases ranging from simple to very complex in planning difficulty. Using a prototype implementation of the method and standard dosimetric radiosurgery treatment planning tools, feasible treatment plans were developed for each target. The treatment plans generated for the phantom targets showed excellent dose conformity and acceptable dose homogeneity within the target volume. The algorithm was able to generate a radiosurgery plan conforming to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) guidelines on radiosurgery for every clinical and phantom target examined.

Conclusions

This automated planning method can serve as a valuable tool to assist treatment planners in rapidly and consistently designing conformal multiple isocenter radiosurgery treatment plans.

### Interplay between spherical confinement and particle shape on the self-assembly of rounded cubes [^97626220]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Analysis of defects

It is not possible to tile the surface of a sphere with a square grid of squares without introducing topological defects. The cubes in our simulations and experiments were nearly always found to align with a square face towards the spherical shell and will thus also form topological defects. The topological defects are characterized by their winding number, which is 90° or π /2 in this case (the rotational symmetry of a square), see Fig. 2e, f. To obtain the curvature of a sphere a total topological charge of 4 π or at least eight topological defects are required. To automate the analysis of the topological defects on the surface of the SPs, we analyzed the orientation of the nanocubes with respect to their neighbors. The topological defects can be identified by tracing a closed chain of particles and tracking the smallest rotation to rotate a particle to the orientation of the next particle in the chain. This is illustrated in Fig. 2f, the particles marked with yellow arrows form a chain and the yellow arrows show the orientation of the particle. If one starts tracing the orientation at the top left particle and follow the chain until one is back at this particle, the orientation has changed by 90° (π /2). This means that this chain surrounds a topological defect of charge π /2. In Fig. 2, we show one of these topological defects on the surface for α = 0.8. The red particles in Fig. 2f of the main text are the particles for which the chain formed by their neighbors surrounds one of these topological defects. The topological defect is a point on the surface of the sphere that lies between these red particles.

Computational model of Cdc42 polarization with explicit GAPs and membrane flow by exocytosis and endocytosis

Spherical Simulation Domain and Parameters

We simulated proteins as a system of particles on a surface representing the plasma membrane that migrate due to both reaction-diffusion and membrane delivery/removal by exocytosis/endocytosis. We focus on a single tip of the fission yeast cell, represented as a sphere with radius 1.8 μm. The particles are either restricted to the surface of this sphere or present in a cytoplasmic pool. Positions of particles in this cytoplasmic pool are not kept track of since we assume cytoplasmic diffusion is fast. The rate constants in the simulation were informed by FRAP experiments (this work), based on prior studies, or estimated as explained below (Tables S2, S3). Simulations were visualized with the Ovito software, version 3.0.0-dev334.

Diffusion

Particle diffusion on the spherical domain surface, with diffusion coefficient D, is implemented with Brownian dynamics as in. Briefly, the magnitude of the displacement due to diffusion over timeis calculated asindependently in both directions in the plane tangent to the sphere at the original particle location, andis a random Gaussian distributed variable with zero mean and unit variance. After calculating the displacement in the tangent plane, the positions of each particle are then projected down to the sphere surface while keeping the distance conserved.

In contrast, if we demandit followsand we obtainwithand. This differential equation can be solved by separation of variables (see Appendix B), yielding the function k (K). Yet, the inverse function, K (k), describes the distribution of the circle radii to achieve a Hamming filter, and is thus required. Although the resulting functioncannot be solved analytically, an inverse series expansion can be performed up to an arbitrary order. For this work, the function K (k) was approximated up to the 70th order. Evaluating K for discrete k i, N min number of circles determined by the Nyquist criterion, gives the radii distributionto achieve a Hamming density, see Figure 1. The number of circles needed to achieve theand the Hamming weighting are displayed in Table 1 for various matrix sizes.

The density simulations (blue, 3rd column) have been performed by gridding of ones without density compensation and an overgridding factor of 1. They match the analytical solutions (red), except of the peaks in the k‐space center which result from imperfections of the gridding algorithm. However they can be taken care of via the pre and post gridding density compensation. We observed a maximum number of three points deviating stronger from the expected densities in the center. For DW‐CONCEPT very minor deviations of the density along the outer most circle (radius k max) were observed due to the Taylor approximation of K.

Quantitative imaging metrics — common sources of systematic errors in imaging and analysis include six categories with representative examples: technical issues during acquisition (differences in hardware and software, acquisition protocol, signal-to-noise ratio, and resolution), biased sampling of structure for analysis (comparison of mismatched airways), failure to define an appropriate reference space, issues with segmentation or registration, inaccurate assumptions or simplifications (assuming alveolar airspaces are spheres), and failure to consider spatiotemporal and biological heterogeneity (anatomical or gravitational gradients in tissue density, ventilation, and perfusion).

### Creating a regular array of metal-complexing molecules on an insulator surface at room temperature [^cce7b36b]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Such a hard-sphere approach results in various periodic structures. In Fig. 5b, seven densely packed unit cells, labeled Domains 1–7, are illustrated. Four of these domains exist in an identical, mirror imaged configuration, labeled with an asterisk. Domains 1, 2, 4, and 7 all have an equal molecule coverage of, while Domain 5 is less densely packed and Domain 6 is more densely packed. The most densely packed structure is Domain 3 with. In principle, other less densely packed unit cells are also possible. However, at low coverage, a hard-sphere interaction does not lead to a noticeable order.

If the assumptions of a single adsorption position and hard-sphere repulsion are correct, we should be able to find some or all of the above-mentioned domains in the locally ordered areas in our images. To inspect whether this simple picture might be useful to explain the experimental findings, we analyze an AFM image taken at high molecular coverage and close tip–sample distance in order to benefit from contrast inversion for imaging the precise molecule position and orientation. As shown in Fig. 5c, the molecule coverage is very high (0.65 molecules per nm 2), resulting in many areas exhibiting local order. Similar to Fig. 3a, due to nonlinear thermal drift the molecule positions are slightly off compared to the expected favored adsorption positions (see Supplementary Discussion, Non-linear Thermal Drift for more details). When marking the center position of the molecules, we can, indeed, identify the above envisioned densely packed configurations on the surface. This finding corroborates our interpretation of hard-sphere repulsion. In the absence of intermolecular attraction, the potential energy does not depend on the specific molecular arrangement on the surface, given that the molecules always occupy the same adsorption position. Therefore, the here observed ordered arrangements at high coverage are caused by the confinement of hard spheres rather than by attractive interaction between the molecules. Local dense packing of some of the spheres increases the number of possibilities to arrange the others. Hence, configurations with some molecules densely packed contribute with a larger number of microstates compared to configurations, where all molecules are more or less evenly spaced. Therefore, configurations with ordered domains represent the typical microstate of confined hard spheres as observed in our experiment (Fig. 5c) as well as in simulation as will be shown in the following.

### Experience of euclidean geometry sculpts the development and dynamics of rodent hippocampal sequential cell assemblies [^6142d72a]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Finally, extended experience with linear environments over four days largely reversed the effects of sphere-rearing. Interestingly, the effects of this spatial deprivation extended to new, not yet experienced linear contexts, indicating that early-life experience of geometry sculpts the neuronal ensemble rules for representing novel spaces. We hypothesize this rapid shift in sphere-reared rats toward accurate depiction of geometric linearity was facilitated by our very selective deprivation from geometric linearity, which spared animal locomotion and age-dependent network maturation, by the evolutionary and ecological affordancesof linear space for rats, and by the presence of preconfigured preplay. While cubic shapes might not occur frequently in the wild habitat of rodents, spatial features of cubic shapes are ubiquitous in Euclidean world where rodents (and humans) live. Therefore, these spatial features could further configure the hippocampal representation of space via their direct experience in addition to the inferred innate concepts of space. Given the role of hippocampus in representing conceptual spacesand sequencesin adult rodents, our findings on the impact of experience of geometric linearity on hippocampal neurodevelopment might extend to representation of broader conceptual domains later in life. Whether the development of a preconfigured adult hippocampal network repertoire for multiple spatial experiences is influenced by experience specifically within a critical period earlier in life, similar to sensory brain networks, and which spatial features of Euclidean geometry are critical to that development remain to be determined.

### A topological fluctuation theorem [^a4612427]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Fluctuation theorems specify the non-zero probability to observe negative entropy production, contrary to a naive expectation from the second law of thermodynamics. For closed particle trajectories in a fluid, Stokes theorem can be used to give a geometric characterization of the entropy production. Building on this picture, we formulate a topological fluctuation theorem that depends only by the winding number around each vortex core and is insensitive to other aspects of the force. The probability is robust to local deformations of the particle trajectory, reminiscent of topologically protected modes in various classical and quantum systems. We demonstrate that entropy production is quantized in these strongly fluctuating systems, and it is controlled by a topological invariant. We demonstrate that the theorem holds even when the probability distributions are non-Gaussian functions of the generated heat.

### Geometric frustration in buckled colloidal monolayers [^b52244f2]. Nature (2008). Excellent credibility.

Geometric frustration arises when lattice structure prevents simultaneous minimization of local interaction energies. It leads to highly degenerate ground states and, subsequently, to complex phases of matter, such as water ice, spin ice, and frustrated magnetic materials. Here we report a simple geometrically frustrated system composed of closely packed colloidal spheres confined between parallel walls. Diameter-tunable microgel spheres are self-assembled into a buckled triangular lattice with either up or down displacements, analogous to an antiferromagnetic Ising model on a triangular lattice. Experiment and theory reveal single-particle dynamics governed by in-plane lattice distortions that partially relieve frustration and produce ground states with zigzagging stripes and subextensive entropy, rather than the more random configurations and extensive entropy of the antiferromagnetic Ising model. This tunable soft-matter system provides a means to directly visualize the dynamics of frustration, thermal excitations and defects.

### A computational model for structural dynamics and reconfiguration of DNA assemblies [^4511a6dd]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

In the hydrodynamic model, we assumed the Stokes flow of viscous, linear, and incompressible fluids, considering the length scale of structured DNA assemblies. The generalized Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa mobility matrixwas employed to construct the friction matrix where six translational and rotational degrees of freedom for each node were considered as in the structural model (Supplementary Note 3). This mobility matrix accounted for the damping of a DNA structure with a complex shape through the superposition of identical spherical particles with a hydrodynamic radius assigned to each node. Then, the inverse of the mobility matrix provided the friction matrix under the linearity of the Stokes flow, quantifying the effect of the viscosity and random thermal force acting on the structure in the solvent.

The governing equations for Langevin dynamics were solved to obtain the trajectories of the DNA structure by using a direct time integration algorithm that we developed. Half-time stepping and Simpson's rule were introduced in the calculation of the internal force vector based on the Grønbech-Jensen Farago scheme(Supplementary Note 4). Its application to representative linear problems (thermal diffusion in a flat potential and thermal harmonic oscillator) confirmed significantly improved numerical stability and performance compared to the original Grønbech-Jensen Farago scheme, enabling us to use a larger step size in time integration and hence to simulate more efficiently. To rapidly reach an equilibrium configuration, the dynamic analysis often began from a statically obtained configuration by minimizing the energy of structural and electrostatic potentials. The overall flow of the proposed analysis framework is described in Supplementary Fig. 1.

Global shape

To validate the proposed analysis framework, we first investigated the mean shape of ten DNA wireframe structures in equilibrium. They included six triangular, two square, and two hexagonal structures, categorized into two types of edges: two-helix bundle (DX)and 6-helix bundle (6HB). The dynamic simulations began from statically predicted energy-minimum configurations and were performed 500-ns-long simulations for them (Fig. 2). As expected, the structures with stiffer 6HB edges showed smaller means and variances in the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values than those with softer DX edges (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 1). The RMSD profiles further indicated that square and hexagonal structures with DX edges were flexible enough to reach another energy-minimum configuration more easily during the dynamic simulations, deviating slightly from the initial configuration obtained from static energy minimization (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3).

### Compliant rolling-contact architected materials for shape reconfigurability [^057df01f]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Architected materials can achieve impressive shape-changing capabilities according to how their microarchitecture is engineered. Here we introduce an approach for dramatically advancing such capabilities by utilizing wrapped flexure straps to guide the rolling motions of tightly packed micro-cams that constitute the material's microarchitecture. This approach enables high shape-morphing versatility and extreme ranges of deformation without accruing appreciable increases in strain energy or internal stress. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional macroscale prototypes are demonstrated, and the analytical theory necessary to design the proposed materials is provided and packaged as a software tool. An approach that combines two-photon stereolithography and scanning holographic optical tweezers is demonstrated to enable the fabrication of the proposed materials at their intended microscale.

### Glenoid concavity has a higher impact on shoulder stability than the size of a bony defect [^635b1fe8]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Fig. 5
Displacement of the humeral head for a single specimen and different defect sizes; the maximum lateral displacement is used for estimation of glenoid depth (d). The concavity gradient is determined as the maximum ratio of lateral displacement (Δ L) related to anterior displacement (Δ A)

In this equation, (r) is the concavity radius, and (d) is the glenoid depth. The concavity radius (r) equals the sphere radius of a best-fit humeral head, which was determined from digitised surface points of the glenoids. The glenoid depth (d) equals the maximum lateral displacement of the robot. In addition, the curvature of the displacement was analysed as follows: the slope of a tangent line in a single point was calculated as the ratio of lateral displacement (Δ L) to anterior displacement (Δ A). This ratio was also denoted as the gradient in this single point. The maximum occurring gradient for a displacement curve was then determined as the maximum ratio of lateral displacement (Δ L) to anterior displacement (Δ A) for all data points. This value was determined for each defect step and defined as concavity gradient given as a percentage.

### Neurons exploit stochastic growth to rapidly and economically build dense dendritic arbors [^26a14496]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Class IV cells have a small mesh size similar to regular polygonal tilings

To quantify the space-filling properties of planar meshes, we defined the mesh size as the diameter of a randomly placed circle that has a 50% chance of intersecting with a line in the mesh. It is the median size of the "holes" in the mesh. A similar concept to mesh size, termed space coverage, is defined by Baltruschat et al. Class IV cells have a mean mesh size of 4 µm, which ranges from 2 µm to 7 µm over development (Fig. 5e, green circles). Because the mesh size is similar to the diameter of the tip of the ovipositor (5 µm at its base), the geometry of the class IV cells is well suited for the avoidance reflex: an ovipositor barb has a > 50% chance of making a direct hit on a branch.

As a benchmark for the economy of meshes, we calculated the mesh size of regular tilings of the plane by triangles, squares, and hexagons (Fig. 5f, left column). Unexpectedly, all regular tilings have the same slope ofwhen the mesh size is plotted against the inverse of their length density (Methods: Tilings by regular polygons). Class IV cells (Fig. 5e, green circles), agent-based simulations of class IV cells(Fig. 5e, blue squares), and Voronoi tessellations (Fig. 5e, purple diamonds), all fall on the same line with slope. This means that for a given total length of branches, these different tilings have the same mesh size: they fill up the space equally economically. Equally spaced parallel lines and directed-rod simulations (Fig. 5e, orange circles) have a smaller slope of 0.5 and are, therefore, more economical, presumably because they do not contain branch points. Other meshes are less economical: randomly spaced parallel lines have a slope of, and Delaunay triangulations have even larger slopes (Fig. 5e, red triangles).

These comparisons show that the class IV arbors economically cover the plane. Therefore, the bottom-up stochastic growth process, governed by purely local rules, generates global structures with optimal properties, similar to structures obtained using top-down design principles such as regular polygons and minimal-spanning-tree models.

### The effects of prosthetic humeral head shape on glenohumeral joint kinematics during humeral axial rotation in total shoulder arthroplasty [^db242c63]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

A non-spherical humeral head has been shown to influence kinematics and stability of the glenohumeral joint; yet, most prosthetic humeral head components are designed to be a perfect sphere. The effect of humeral head shape on prosthetic joint kinematics after total shoulder arthroplasty is not well understood. We hypothesized that prosthetic joint kinematics during humeral axial rotation is dependent on humeral head shape, regardless of joint conformity.

Methods

Four prosthetic configurations were investigated using a spherical and a non-spherical prosthetic humeral head articulated with a conforming and a non-conforming glenoid component. Testing was performed in the coronal, scapular, and forward flexion plane at 0°, 30°, and 60° of abduction. Prosthetic joint kinematics was measured in 10° intervals during a 100° arc of humeral axial rotation. Glenohumeral translation patterns, net glenohumeral translation, and averaged glenohumeral translation were compared for each of 4 configurations.

Results

Non-spherical head configurations increased the net glenohumeral translation during humeral axial rotation in multiple test positions compared with spherical head configurations (P < .05). Spherical head configurations resulted in a relatively small amount of glenohumeral translation, less than 2mm. The radius of curvature of the glenoid component alone did not affect the net glenohumeral translation within each of the 2 head groups (P > .05).

Conclusion

During humeral axial rotation, the non-spherical humeral head shape contributes to increased glenohumeral translation during humeral axial rotation. However, the spherical head shape does not show significant glenohumeral translation during humeral axial rotation, regardless of glenoid conformity.

### Topological colloids [^f605446c]. Nature (2013). Excellent credibility.

Smoke, fog, jelly, paints, milk and shaving cream are common everyday examples of colloids, a type of soft matter consisting of tiny particles dispersed in chemically distinct host media. Being abundant in nature, colloids also find increasingly important applications in science and technology, ranging from direct probing of kinetics in crystals and glasses to fabrication of third-generation quantum-dot solar cells. Because naturally occurring colloids have a shape that is typically determined by minimization of interfacial tension (for example, during phase separation) or faceted crystal growth, their surfaces tend to have minimum-area spherical or topologically equivalent shapes such as prisms and irregular grains (all continuously deformable — homeomorphic — to spheres). Although toroidal DNA condensates and vesicles with different numbers of handles can exist and soft matter defects can be shaped as rings and knots, the role of particle topology in colloidal systems remains unexplored. Here we fabricate and study colloidal particles with different numbers of handles and genus g ranging from 1 to 5. When introduced into a nematic liquid crystal — a fluid made of rod-like molecules that spontaneously align along the so-called 'director' — these particles induce three-dimensional director fields and topological defects dictated by colloidal topology. Whereas electric fields, photothermal melting and laser tweezing cause transformations between configurations of particle-induced structures, three-dimensional nonlinear optical imaging reveals that topological charge is conserved and that the total charge of particle-induced defects always obeys predictions of the Gauss-Bonnet and Poincaré-Hopf index theorems. This allows us to establish and experimentally test the procedure for assignment and summation of topological charges in three-dimensional director fields. Our findings lay the groundwork for new applications of colloids and liquid crystals that range from topological memory devices, through new types of self-assembly, to the experimental study of low-dimensional topology.

### Designing highly efficient interlocking interactions in anisotropic active particles [^dc64cd14]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In contrast to synthetic active particles, biological microswimmers often have non-spherical shapes – and simulations have predicted that their collective behavior is strongly influenced by shape. For example, longitudinally-propelled rods self-organize into polar bands instead of clusters as a consequence of the lateral association promoted by their elongated shape –. Clusters of anisotropic active particles may not only display Brownian diffusion, but also directed and spinning motion. In addition, the critical density at which cluster form has been proposed to depend on shape because it strongly influences inter-particle slowing down. For active hexagons, for example, efficient deceleration upon collision results in nucleation of many small clusters at far lower particle densities than would be expected for spheres.

Despite these predictions, there is little experimental work due to the limited availability of active particles with an anisotropic shape. Experiments with transversely-propelled rods revealed that stable doublets already form at particle densities of ≈ 1%and clustering is favored with increasing aspect ratio of the rods. Tori, both horizontally and vertically oriented, were observed to form dynamic unstable clustersand standing disks were found to cluster at about 10%. While more complex shapes have been prepared, it is often challenging to selectively generate sufficient quantities to test their phase behavior and typically not possible to gradually tune their shape to find optimal clustering conditions.

Here, we use 3D micro-fabrication to create active particles with a shape that is continuously tunable between a sphere and a rod, i.e. bent rods, and study their collective behavior at low particle densities. We find that clustering occurs at extremely low surface area fractions (below 0.022%) due to a highly efficient nucleation process that relies on interlocking between the particles. Complementing our experiments with simulations and an analytical model, we find that the self-organization at low particle densities can be captured by a Michaelis-Menten kinetics and thus can be characterized by a single scaling parameter that depends on the particle density and shape only. We demonstrate that the efficiency of the self-organization process is strongly influenced by the concave shape, which affects the interplay between interlocking and stability, and show that the combination of directed motion and steric interactions leads to motility induced clustering. Our insights provide a generic understanding of how phase separation occurs in a whole class of anisotropic particles from spheres to rods as well as a strategy to precisely control the stability of active particles through the shape of their interaction site, thus enabling the rational design of their assembly pathways into functional active materials.

### Single crystal toroidal diamond anvils for high pressure experiments beyond 5 megabar [^df4a8b19]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

High-pressure experiments with toroidal diamond anvils

Our design is simply a modification of a conventional single beveled diamond anvil. We used FIB to mill a toroidal surface onto the central culet. This configuration achieved pressures well in excess of the highest pressures attained by conventional beveled and double-beveled single-crystal diamond anvils. Moreover, experiments are prepared in a similar manner to a conventional DAC experiment, pre-indenting a Re gasket to a thickness of 5–10 µm, drilling a 3–4 µm diameter hole with a FIB in the gasket, and mounting our sample in the hole (see description in the Methods section). The anvil surfaces were crafted at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) based on our own designs that underwent several iterations during the past couple of years. Obviously, there are large number of parameters one can tweak to arrive at a configuration suitable to reach 5 Mbar. However, due to the limited experimental time and resources, we focused on tuning the most basic parameters of a toroidal diamond anvil surface: the diameter of the culet, the radius of the torus, and the height of the center disk relative to the culet — this we translated into the maximum depth of the torus — and lastly the height of the flat shoulder outside the torus. These parameters can be seen in Fig. 1a, labeled as c, d, r T, and d 2 respectively. The three-dimensional (3D) model only shows the 80 × 80 µm 2 center culet area of the diamond (Fig. 1b). One of the successful image of the designs taken with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) right after milling is shown in Fig. 1c; on the SEM image one can observe that at the edge of the milled section there is a smoothed step-like feature. This is an artifact of the FIB milling process, and we mitigate this feature by milling in a slope feature over a distance of 4 µm to remove the very sharp edge that is left behind after the initial milling process. Leaving the edge feature will result in a premature failure of the diamonds which is initiated at these sharp edges as they cut through the gasket and become stress concentration points. High-pressure compression experiments for torus parameter optimization were carried out with rhenium gaskets and rhenium as samples, with one single exception when we used a W 25 -Re 75 alloy gasket.

### The mitotic spindle is chiral due to torques within microtubule bundles [^2f994257]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Balance of forces and torques in the spindle and the associated bundle shapes

In our model, two spindle poles are represented as spheres of radius d with centers separated by vector L of length L = | L |, and microtubule bundles are represented as curved lines connecting these spheres (Fig. 3b). Microtubule bundles, denoted by index i = 1,…, n, extend between points located at the surface of the left and right sphere, where positions with respect to the center of each sphere are given by vectors d i and, respectively. Here, n denotes the number of microtubule bundles. Because the shape of the spindle is static in our model, we introduce a balance of forces and torques for the interaction between the spindle poles and microtubule bundles (Fig. 3c), without describing where the forces and torques are generated. For the left pole, the force balance readsand the balance of torques readsHere, F i and M i denote the forces and torques exerted by the left pole at the i th microtubule bundle, respectively. They represent a resultant force and torque of all interactions between microtubules and the pole. Balances of forces and torques at the right pole are obtained by replacing F i, M i, and d i in Eqs. (1) and (2) with, and, respectively. Here and throughout the text, the prime sign corresponds to the right pole. We also introduce a balance of forcesand a balance of torques for the microtubule bundle

Forces and torques acting at the microtubule bundle change its shape because microtubule bundles are elastic objects. We describe a microtubule bundle as a single elastic rod of flexural rigidity κ and torsional rigidity τ. The contour of the elastic rod is described by a contour length, s, and a vector representing the position in space with respect to the initial point at the sphere representing the spindle pole, r (s) (Fig. 3d). The normalized tangent vector is calculated as t = d r /d s. The torsion angle, ϕ (s), describes the orientation of the cross-section along the length of the rod. The curvature and the torsion of an elastic rod are described by the static Kirchoff equation, which is a generalization of previous models for the curvature of spindle microtubules,

We use this equation to calculate the shapes of microtubule bundles for a set of forces and torques that obey Eqs. (1)–(4).

### Dynamics and universal scaling law in geometrically-controlled sessile drop evaporation [^33e61d58]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Results

Experimental methods

In order to generate reproducible non-spherical sessile drops with well-defined geometries, we machined and polished very thin pedestals (height H = 0.1 ± 0.05 mm) with given canonical shapes (including circular, pentagonal, square and triangular) and more exotic geometries (for example, kidney or half-moon shapes) in aluminium disks with a large thermal mass (diameter × height = 3.8 × 1 cm). In some experiments, the substrates were heated and kept at constant temperature T w by means of a film heater attached to the lower side, a thermocouple and a proportional-integral-derivative feedback loop. The size of the pedestals shapes was chosen such that the contact line would have a predetermined perimeter P equal for all of them. Three sizes were considered: P = 12, 15 and 17 mm. Sharp corners were purposely avoided as these would correspond to singularities according to the Laplace pressure. The corner radius was selected to be R c = 0.4 mm in all cases. A given volume of liquid V ≤ 7 μl (± 1.2%) placed on such geometries with a micropipette would be pinned at the edges of the pedestal, thus leading to highly reproducible drop shapes. Each experiment was repeated at least five times. Drops of pure water required additional treatment of the pedestal's upper surface with a hydrophilic coating prior to drop deposition to ensure precise, repeatable contact-line pinning. Tests were carried out to ensure that the effect of the pedestal height was negligible, and that the coating did not have any influence on the flow dynamics or evaporation kinetics (see Methods).

### Shaping micro-clusters via inverse jamming and topographic close-packing of microbombs [^7662020f]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Programming the degrees of freedom in topographic clusters

Empirically, the final clusters can be programmed by the number of seeds (N = 1, 2, 3,…) and the number of vertices of the well (V = 0, 3, 4, 5, and 6 for circles, triangles, squares, pentagons, and hexagons, respectively) providing topographic confinement. As shown in Fig. 5a, we analyzed over 2000 clusters. In the confinement of N = 1, single-cell particles could be created by filling the microwell, imitating the shape of the confinement. For N > 1, the differentiated cleavages were symmetric when k = V / N yielded an integer k, i.e. (V, N) = (0, 2), (0, 3), (3, 3), (4, 2), (6, 2), and (6, 3). Otherwise, clusters with random microbomb assembly were observed. Regarding the orientation of the constituent cells, the (6, 2) combination, for example, could program two types of symmetric clusters: one with a cleavage wall normal to one of the 6 edges where the interior angle of a unit is 3 π (marked as a black line), and the other containing two isosceles trapezoids (internal angle is 2 π) shares the space diagonally (marked as a blue line). In addition, it is important to note that since there are no predictable cues for the cleavage orientation in the case of the singularity (V = 0), the perfect programming of clusters (100%) for all cases of N is warranted from the non-pinning mobility in confinement. The SEM images in Fig. 5b, c reveal the hollow nature of the clusters from a triangular prism (Fig. 5b) and a cube with a cleavage connecting four cells (Fig. 5c) after focused ion beam (FIB) milling. At room temperature, the shell became glassy again, and thus the microbombs could maintain the packed shape permanently.

### Condensation droplet sieve [^554a7c36]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Based on the CNN results, the droplet number density N d (number of droplets per projected area) in evenly spaced droplet radius ranges from 0 to 100 μm is shown in Fig. 2c in a logarithmic coordinate. The distribution of N d is averaged by 2400 frames of breath figures after the condensation reaches a steady state at 1200 s. On the planar surface, the droplet radii are loosely distributed. Many of them fall in the region colored gray, where droplets are large enough to be visible to the naked eye with a limit of 50 μm in diameter, corresponding to an observing distance of 20 cm. The maximum radius r M observed on the planar surface is 173 μm. On the contrary, droplet sizes are distributed intensively in a narrow range of droplet radii on the TWL surface, with a maximum radius of 16 μm, smaller than the limit of human vision. This result reveals that there exists a condensation droplet sieve that filters out all large droplets, denoted using the orange dashed line. The black solid curves are the theoretical distributions, which are highly consistent with the experimental results (details of the theory in Supplementary Discussion 5). The number density of droplets smaller than 10 μm is doubled on the TWL surface compared with the planar surface, thanks to more area exposed without large droplets, which is illustrated explicitly by the distribution of N d in a linear coordinate (Supplementary Discussion 6).

The inset in the chart of the TWL surface shows the centimeter-scale breath figures on the bare cooling stage surface, planar surface and TWL surface from the left to the right. Puddles that are several millimeters large form on the metallic surface of the cooling stage. Visible droplets with radii at the scale of 100 μm remain on the planar surface. In comparison, the breath figure on the TWL surface is uniform without visible sessile droplets. Even though dark spots that represent droplets at the scale of 10 μm are observable in this image, they are not detectable by the naked eye when observed from a distance of 20 cm.

### Radiofrequency thermal ablation: computer analysis of the size of the thermal injury created by overlapping ablations [^6251cdc7]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to perform a computer analysis of the size of the thermal injury created by overlapping multiple thermal ablation spheres.

Materials and Methods

A computer-assisted design system was used to create three-dimensional models of a spherical tumor, a spherical tissue volume consisting of the tumor plus a 1-cm tumor-free margin, and individual spherical ablations. These volumes were superimposed in real-time three-dimensional space in different geometric relationships. The effect of the size and geometric configuration of the ablation spheres was analyzed with regard to the ability to ablate the required volume of tissue (tumor plus margin) without leaving untreated areas or interstices.

Results

The single-ablation model showed that if a 360-degree 1-cm tumor-free margin is included around the tumor targeted for ablation, radiofrequency ablation devices producing 3-, 4-, and 5-cm ablation spheres can be used to treat 1-, 2-, and 3-cm tumors, respectively. The six-sphere model, in which six ablation spheres are placed in orthogonal planes around the tumor, showed that the largest tumor that may be treated with a 3-cm ablation device is 1.75 cm, whereas 4- and 5-cm ablation spheres can be used to treat tumors measuring 3 and 4.25 cm, respectively. The 14- sphere model showed that addition of eight more spheres to the six-sphere model increased the treatable tumor size to 3, 4.6, or 6.3 cm, depending on the diameter of the ablation sphere used. For treating larger tumors, we found a cylindrical model to be less efficient but easier to control.

Conclusion

Our computer analysis showed that the size of the composite thermal injury created by overlapping multiple thermal ablation spheres is surprisingly small relative to the number of ablations performed. These results emphasize the need for a methodic tumor ablation strategy.

The exact processes by which interstellar matter condenses to form young stars are of great interest, in part because they bear on the formation of planets like our own from the material that fails to become part of the star. Theoretical models suggest that ejection of gas during early phases of stellar evolution is a key mechanism for removing excess angular momentum, thereby allowing material to drift inwards towards the star through an accretion disk. Such ejections also limit the mass that can be accumulated by the stellar core. To date, these ejections have been observed to be bipolar and highly collimated, in agreement with theory. Here we report observations at very high angular resolution of the proper motions of an arc of water-vapour masers near a very young, massive star in Cepheus. We find that the arc of masers can be fitted to a circle with an accuracy of one part in a thousand, and that the structure is expanding. Only a sphere will always produce a circle in projection, so our observations strongly suggest that the perfectly spherical ejection of material from this star took place about 33 years earlier. The spherical symmetry of the ejecta and its episodic nature are very surprising in the light of present theories.

Cell membrane wrapping energy during invasion

The wrapping energy was calculated by considering changes to the free energy of the erythrocyte membrane due to a localised deformation and depends on its tension and bending modulus. We consider the deformation to be localised to a disc of radius R which is deformed by a merozoite to a half-sphere of the same radius. Assuming a very simple hemi-spherical geometry, the sum of these two contributions is given bywhere R = 1 μm is the radius of the merozoite, σ is the tension, and κ is the bending modulus. The above equation is derived in ref.
