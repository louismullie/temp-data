## Question

corneal abrasion management?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a step-by-step management plan for corneal abrasion. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding sight-threatening mimics. Then, I should classify the abrasion and identify high-risk features. Next, I will outline core treatment principles, including pain control, infection prophylaxis, and supportive care. After that, I need to address special populations such as contact lens wearers and children. Then, I should set follow-up and referral triggers. Finally, I will consider prevention counseling and reconcile any conflicting guidance, especially around topical anesthetics and patching, to ensure the plan is evidence-based and safe [^117KxVfQ] [^115URB5m].

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and exclude emergencies. I need to check visual acuity, perform a focused history for trauma, contact lens use, chemicals, and foreign body, and then stain with fluorescein to visualize the epithelial defect under cobalt blue light; I should also sweep for a retained foreign body and evert the lids to look for hidden material, while keeping a low threshold to suspect open globe if there is a deep laceration, irregular pupil, or significant vision loss, in which case I should avoid manipulation and arrange urgent ophthalmology [^117KxVfQ] [^1149bgFP].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should classify the abrasion and identify high-risk features. Small, uncomplicated abrasions under about 4 mm in otherwise healthy corneas tend to heal quickly, whereas large abrasions, contact lens–associated injuries, retained foreign material, immunocompromised hosts, or those with delayed presentation carry higher risk of infection or delayed healing and merit closer follow-up and broader antibiotic coverage [^117KxVfQ] [^115HiSHQ].

> Next, I should review core treatment principles. Pain control, infection prophylaxis, and supportive care are the pillars; I need to ensure I tailor choices to abrasion size, mechanism, and patient risk, and I should remember that most abrasions heal within 24–72 hours, so my plan should be safe, practical, and time-limited with clear stop criteria [^117KxVfQ].

> For pain control, let me consider topical NSAIDs first because they have the strongest evidence for reducing pain and oral analgesic use in the first 24–48 hours; options include ketorolac 0.5% or diclofenac 0.1% with dosing every 6–8 hours, and I should pair this with oral acetaminophen or ibuprofen as needed, while avoiding opioids when possible due to sedation and nausea risks [^1151F6x3] [^113a1F3T] [^115RT9S7].

> Wait, I should verify the role of cycloplegics. Initially, I thought cycloplegics don't help uncomplicated abrasions, and AAFP guidance discourages routine use; but hold on, I should double-check because wilderness and ophthalmology sources support cycloplegics for ciliary spasm and photophobia, especially with larger defects or iritis, so a balanced approach is to avoid routine cycloplegia for small, simple abrasions and consider cyclopentolate 1% twice daily for larger abrasions or when there is significant photophobia or spasm, reassessing at 24 hours [^112ESrny] [^111hSGJw] [^111Z5jen].

> I need to ensure infection prophylaxis is appropriate. For low-risk, small abrasions, a broad-spectrum topical antibiotic such as erythromycin ointment or chloramphenicol drops is reasonable; for contact lens wearers or higher-risk scenarios, I should use an antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone like moxifloxacin or levofloxacin, and I should advise no contact lens wear during treatment; evidence for routine antibiotics is mixed, but given low risk and potential benefit, many guidelines still recommend prophylaxis, especially in higher-risk groups [^114psjwz] [^115Dz9G4] [^111Amomi] [^115hFczy].

> Let me consider supportive care. Frequent preservative-free artificial tears during the day and a lubricating ointment at bedtime reduce lid friction and discomfort; sunglasses help with photophobia; and I should explicitly instruct no eye rubbing to avoid worsening the defect or causing recurrent erosion [^111eGzb1] [^111ctqst] [^117H55N6].

> But wait, what about patching? I should confirm that modern guidance advises against routine patching because it does not improve pain and may delay healing; I will avoid pressure patching for simple abrasions and reserve bandage contact lens use for select large abrasions with ophthalmology oversight, ensuring no retained foreign body and using concurrent antibiotics with planned early removal [^116vTb33] [^112kJEFP] [^11785W4r].

> Now, I will address special populations. For contact lens wearers, I must treat with an antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone, forbid lens wear until fully healed, and avoid patching or therapeutic lenses early due to keratitis risk; for children, I should avoid patching because it interferes with activities and does not improve outcomes; for perioperative or sedation-related abrasions, I should anticipate symptoms 1–3 hours post-procedure and initiate treatment promptly using the same principles, recognizing risk factors like lateral/prone positioning and longer procedures [^115Dz9G4] [^112TfJFK] [^112BzxJW] [^116p12Mb].

> Next, I should review follow-up and safety netting. For small, uncomplicated abrasions with improving symptoms and normal vision, strict follow-up may not be necessary, but I should arrange re-evaluation in 24 hours for larger defects, contact lens wearers, immunocompromised patients, or if symptoms persist; red flags requiring urgent ophthalmology include worsening pain after 48 hours, vision decline, corneal infiltrate or ulcer, purulent discharge, or any concern for infection or penetrating injury [^117KxVfQ] [^112BU6vo].

> I will now examine prevention counseling. I need to ensure patients understand protective eyewear during risky activities, proper contact lens hygiene, and avoidance of eye rubbing; in occupational or procedural settings, emphasizing eye protection and moisture preservation reduces recurrence and severity, aligning with public health models that show early treatment and prevention messaging reduce ulceration and costs [^116EDHrW] [^114jf4aV].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should reconcile conflicting guidance on topical anesthetics. ACEP 2024 suggests that limited home use of topical anesthetics may be acceptable in strictly selected simple abrasions with tight quantity limits and short duration, but Cochrane reviews and ophthalmology sources conclude evidence is insufficient and highlight risks of abuse, delayed healing, and corneal toxicity; given very low certainty and potential harm, I should avoid prescribing topical anesthetics for home use outside of a protocolized, closely supervised setting and reserve them, if at all, for diagnostic aid only [^112vBqST] [^114yiuCv] [^113cuxwL] [^115ehWzi].

> Let me reconsider the overall flow to ensure internal consistency. Confirm diagnosis and exclude emergencies, classify risk, provide NSAID-based analgesia with oral backup, use antibiotics tailored to risk with special attention to contact lens wearers, avoid routine patching, deliver supportive lubrication and photophobia mitigation, set clear 24-hour follow-up triggers, and counsel on prevention; this approach aligns with AAFP, AAO, WMS, and contemporary systematic reviews while transparently noting areas of low-certainty evidence and practice variation [^117KxVfQ] [^115HiSHQ] [^11785W4r] [^1151F6x3].

Corneal abrasion management centers on **pain control, infection prevention, and close follow-up** [^117KxVfQ]. Topical NSAIDs [^113a1F3T] and oral acetaminophen or ibuprofen are first-line for pain; **avoid topical anesthetics outside the clinic** due to toxicity and delayed healing risks [^113cuxwL] [^114yiuCv]. Use a **broad-spectrum topical antibiotic** (erythromycin or bacitracin) for all abrasions, and a fluoroquinolone for contact lens wearers or high-risk cases [^111Amomi] [^115Dz9G4]. Do not patch [^116vTb33]; instead, use lubricating drops and sunglasses for comfort [^117H55N6] [^111ctqst]. Arrange re-evaluation in 24–48 hours, and refer urgently for large defects, contact lens–related injury, immunocompromise, or worsening symptoms [^117KxVfQ].

---

## Clinical evaluation and diagnosis

- **History**: Mechanism, contact lens use, foreign body, chemicals, prior eye disease, and systemic conditions (e.g. diabetes, immunocompromise) [^117KxVfQ].

- **Examination**: Visual acuity, slit-lamp with fluorescein, assess size/depth, and check for foreign body or rust ring [^117KxVfQ].

- **Imaging**: Not routine; consider CT if globe injury is suspected [^notfound].

---

## Pain management

- **Topical NSAIDs**: Ketorolac or diclofenac reduce pain and oral analgesic use without delaying healing [^117Jxk2f] [^1151F6x3].

- **Oral analgesics**: Acetaminophen or ibuprofen for moderate pain [^115RT9S7].

- **Avoid topical anesthetics**: Do not prescribe for home use due to epithelial toxicity and delayed healing [^113cuxwL] [^112iP8rA].

---

## Infection prevention

- **Topical antibiotics**: Erythromycin or bacitracin for all abrasions; fluoroquinolones (e.g. moxifloxacin) for contact lens wearers or high-risk cases [^11785W4r] [^115Dz9G4].

- **Contact lens wearers**: Use antipseudomonal coverage and advise no lens wear until healed [^115Dz9G4].

- **Evidence**: Antibiotics may reduce infection risk, though data are limited; still standard practice [^115HiSHQ] [^115hFczy] [^117KxVfQ].

---

## Supportive care and patient education

Avoid **eye patching**, as it does not improve pain or healing and may delay recovery [^116vTb33]. Provide **lubricating drops** for comfort and photophobia relief [^111eGzb1]. Advise wearing **sunglasses** to reduce photophobia [^111ctqst]. Educate patients not to rub the eye, to use medications as prescribed, and to recognize red flags for urgent care [^1149bgFP].

---

## Follow-up and referral

Arrange **re-evaluation in 24–48 hours** to confirm healing and detect complications [^117KxVfQ]. Refer urgently for large defects, contact lens–related injury, immunocompromise, or worsening pain, vision loss, or corneal infiltrate [^117KxVfQ]. Most abrasions heal in 24–72 hours; persistent symptoms warrant ophthalmology referral [^117KxVfQ].

---

## Complications and prognosis

Complications include **infection, recurrent erosion, and vision loss** if not managed properly [^114T8LpU]. Prognosis is excellent with appropriate care; early treatment reduces ulceration and preserves vision [^114jf4aV].

---

## Special considerations

In **contact lens wearers**, use fluoroquinolones and avoid patching or therapeutic lenses due to keratitis risk [^115BdaDc]. In **immunocompromised patients**, use aggressive prophylaxis and close follow-up. For **large abrasions (> 10 mm²)**, consider cycloplegics and arrange early ophthalmology follow-up [^111Z5jen].

---

Corneal abrasion management emphasizes **pain control, infection prevention, and close follow-up**; most heal quickly with appropriate care, and complications are minimized by avoiding topical anesthetics and patching while using antibiotics and timely follow-up [^117KxVfQ].

### Use of topical anesthetics in the management of patients with simple corneal abrasions: consensus guidelines from the American College of Emergency Physicians [^112vBqST]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The management of corneal abrasions has largely excluded dispensing topical local anesthetics for home use due to concern for corneal toxicity. We have reviewed and critically appraised the available literature evidence regarding the use of topical anesthetics in patients with simple corneal abrasions. Using sequential Delphi review, we have developed these clinical guidelines. Herein are evidentiary summaries and consensus recommendations for 8 specific relevant questions. Our key observation is that for only simple corneal abrasions, as diagnosed and treated in accordance with the full protocol described herein, it appears safe to prescribe or otherwise provide a commercial topical anesthetic (ie, proparacaine, tetracaine, oxybuprocaine) for use up to every 30 minutes as needed during the first 24 hours after presentation, as long as no more than 1.5 to 2 mL total (an expected 24-hour supply) is dispensed and any remainder is discarded after 24 hours. Importantly, although published findings suggest absent harm for short courses, more rigorous studies with a greater cumulative sample size and ophthalmologic follow-up are needed.

### Evaluation and management of corneal abrasions [^117KxVfQ]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Corneal abrasions are commonly encountered in primary care. Patients typically present with a history of trauma and symptoms of foreign body sensation, tearing, and sensitivity to light. History and physical examination should exclude serious causes of eye pain, including penetrating injury, infective keratitis, and corneal ulcers. After fluorescein staining of the cornea, an abrasion will appear yellow under normal light and green in cobalt blue light. Physicians should carefully examine for foreign bodies and remove them, if present. The goals of treatment include pain control, prevention of infection, and healing. Pain relief may be achieved with topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or oral analgesics. Evidence does not support the use of topical cycloplegics for uncomplicated corneal abrasions. Patching is not recommended because it does not improve pain and has the potential to delay healing. Although evidence is lacking, topical antibiotics are commonly prescribed to prevent bacterial superinfection. Contact lens-related abrasions should be treated with antipseudomonal topical antibiotics. Follow-up may not be necessary for patients with small (4 mm or less), uncomplicated abrasions; normal vision; and resolving symptoms. All other patients should be reevaluated in 24 hours. Referral is indicated for any patient with symptoms that do not improve or that worsen, a corneal infiltrate or ulcer, significant vision loss, or a penetrating eye injury.

### A department-of-anesthesiology-based management protocol for perioperative corneal abrasions [^11114msJ]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, our data support the concept that anesthesiologists, with minimal training in examining the cornea, can safely and effectively manage simple CAs in the perioperative period, so long as they use proper selection criteria to refer difficult problems early and employ persistent follow-up. In an operative setting where ophthalmologists are generally not immediately available, the anesthesiology-led protocol we devised provides for early diagnosis and initiation of treatment. Having our protocol in place also obviates the need to have an ophthalmologist see the patients, reducing cost of care. Hence, this program, in conjunction with ophthalmology support, has allowed for timely and effective care to the small portion of individuals exhibiting symptoms of CA within our institution.

### A department-of-anesthesiology-based management protocol for perioperative corneal abrasions [^116p12Mb]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Corneal abrasions (CAs) are the most common ocular injuries in the perioperative period, occurring at an incidence typically between 0.013% and 0.17% of non-ocular surgeries.–Although most are minor and involve only the surface epithelium, they still produce considerable discomfort. Generally, symptoms of CA are recognized between 1 hour and 3 hours following the conclusion of anesthesia, at which point an ophthalmologist is consulted to care for the injury. At community hospitals where ophthalmologists are not readily available, patients have to wait before receiving treatment. Undoubtedly, this prolonged waiting period may lead to unnecessary suffering and dissatisfaction.

For most patients, a combination of eye drops is the most effective method for healing CAs. Given this regimen's simplicity, requiring that patients wait to see a specialist for the care of CAs seems especially unnecessary. Hence, to lessen the time between symptom onset and treatment – and in turn patient suffering and dissatisfaction – an anesthesiology-based protocol for the management of minor CAs identified in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) was developed with input from ophthalmology (Figure 1). This protocol became the standard approach at our institution. The current study sought to assess the effectiveness of this anesthesiology-based protocol, as well as clarify the incidence of CA and examine some of its associated risk factors.

### An audit of corneal abrasion management following the introduction of local guidelines in an accident and emergency department [^116ekUui]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Corneal abrasions are a common presentation to accident and emergency (A&E) departments. Patients can be treated and discharged by A&E staff without the need for an ophthalmologist's attention; complicated cases, however, should be recognised and referred. Inexperience and limited training in ophthalmology may lead to suboptimal patient care and inappropriate use of ophthalmology outpatient clinics. Issues of poor documentation may also arise. The purpose of this audit was to assess the effect of guidelines on the management of corneal abrasion by A&E staff.

Methods

A retrospective case note audit was performed to assess current management of corneal abrasions. Guidelines for management of corneal abrasions were formulated following a literature search and collaboration between A&E and ophthalmology staff. A prospective case note audit was undertaken to assess management after introduction of the guidelines.

Results

A total of 51 cases were audited before the introduction of the guidelines and 57 cases after. Following the introduction of the guidelines documentation of visual acuity increased to 93% and specific enquiry into contact lens wear rose from 35.3% to 71.9%. A&E staff stopped giving out local anaesthetic eye drops. The follow up profile also improved; appropriate patient discharges increased by 40% whereas inappropriate referrals to eye clinic dropped by 75%. More patients were given abrasion advice (a 101% increase).

Conclusions

A&E staff members are capable of managing corneal abrasions if they are given guidance and some training. This audit identified shortcomings in current management and showed that guidelines can significantly improve clinical practice.

Discussion

The current study demonstrates the effectiveness of an anesthesiology-led protocol for the identification and treatment of minor eye injuries identified in the recovery room. In hospitals where an ophthalmologist is not readily available, this eliminates the needs for the patient to wait before the diagnosis and treatment are initiated in the majority of patients exhibiting symptoms of perioperative CA.

Between March 2007 and December 2011, there were 91,064 patients undergoing surgeries in our hospital, with 171 presenting with eye complaints in the PACU. With the use of fluorescein staining and cobalt light, the Department of Anesthesiology diagnosed 118 of these patients with CAs. Subsequently, by following protocol guidelines, Anesthesiology alone successfully managed 110 (93.22%). Importantly, all patients diagnosed with CA experienced resolution of symptoms within 24 hours of treatment. Hence, our study demonstrates continued success with this anesthesiology-led protocol seeking to expedite the diagnosis and treatment of intraoperative CAs, evincing that anesthesiologists are capable of effectively managing these simple ocular injuries.

The main motivation for initiating an anesthesiologist-driven protocol was to reduce the amount of time between the patient experiencing eye pain or discomfort and the time of initiation of the appropriate treatment. In our study, the median time to treatment for patients exhibiting symptoms of CA perioperatively was 2.6 hours, with a range of 2 minutes to 8.82 hours. Further, the overwhelming majority of these patients (92.0%) received treatment in less than 5.25 hours. Importantly, it should be noted that the measure of time to treatment in our study is the most conservative estimate of the time patients had to consciously wait to receive treatment for their ocular injuries, as it includes both the time it takes for symptoms to surface and the time between symptom onset and treatment initiation. Given that 1) it typically takes between 1 hour and 3 hours just for the symptoms of CAs to become apparent,–and 2) the mean time to treatment for CAs in our study (which includes this symptom onset period) is less than 3 hours, our study demonstrates that anesthesiologists trained under our protocol are attentive and quick to effectively manage CAs once symptoms arise. By reducing the time between symptom onset and treatment, our anesthesiology-led protocol may increase patient satisfaction.

Conclusions

Early treatment of corneal abrasions is crucial in prevention of ulceration and thereby the cascade of the management of the corneal ulcer in patients and the cost borne by them, as proven by both prospective and retrospective analysis as well as scenario modelling. Increasing awareness with campaigns so that patients will act promptly when they develop corneal abrasions by accessing the local healthcare with early treatment, may help in prevention of ulcerations and improve clinical outcome at low cost and will avoid complex and expensive treatment thus preserving sight and reducing corneal blindness.

Methods

This was a medical record review approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board. The University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board has full Association for the Accreditation of Human Research Protection Program, Inc Accreditation and has approved this research examining perioperative CAs for the Department of Anesthesiology.

Each case of perioperative eye complaint was documented as it arose. Patients presenting with such complaints were treated in accordance with the guidelines of an anesthesiology-led protocol. The efficacy of this protocol is what we sought to evaluate in this study. After obtaining Institutional Review Board approval from the University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, for research protocol: Perioperative Corneal Abrasions: A Systematic Approach to Diagnosis and Management (University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board # PRO14030717), medical records were examined from March 1, 2007 to December 31, 2011 of all patients who complained of eye pain or discomfort following non-ocular surgery (barring pediatric and obstetric). Additionally, medical records of patients diagnosed with perioperative CA between 2002 and 2006 were reviewed to determine the amount of time these patients waited to receive treatment.

### Management of corneal abrasions [^115N6v4o]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Corneal abrasions result from cutting, scratching, or abrading the thin, protective, clear coat of the exposed anterior portion of the ocular epithelium. These injuries cause pain, tearing, photophobia, foreign body sensation, and a gritty feeling. Symptoms can be worsened by exposure to light, blinking, and rubbing the injured surface against the inside of the eyelid. Visualizing the cornea under cobalt-blue filtered light after the application of fluorescein can confirm the diagnosis. Most corneal abrasions heal in 24 to 72 hours and rarely progress to corneal erosion or infection. Although eye patching traditionally has been recommended in the treatment of corneal abrasions, multiple well-designed studies show that patching does not help and may hinder healing. Topical mydriatics also are not beneficial. Initial treatment should be symptomatic, consisting of foreign body removal and analgesia with topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or oral analgesics; topical antibiotics also may be used. Corneal abrasions can be avoided through the use of protective eyewear.

### A department-of-anesthesiology-based management protocol for perioperative corneal abrasions [^113ULyjw]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Corneal abrasions (CAs) are the most prevalent ocular injuries in the perioperative period. Previously, patients at our community hospital would wait for an ophthalmologist to be available to manage these minor injuries. To decrease this waiting period – and thereby increase patient satisfaction – we developed an anesthesiology-based protocol to manage minor CAs arising in the recovery room. The current study sought to assess this protocol's efficacy as well as further establish the incidence and some risk factors of CA.

Methods

This was a hospital-based, observational study. As per protocol, anesthesiologists saw and diagnosed any patient exhibiting symptoms of CA, after which they initiated a preestablished treatment regimen. To examine the efficacy of this protocol between March 2007 and December 2011, the number of CAs anesthesiologists managed and time to treatment were recorded. Additionally, the frequency of CAs was established along with some of their risk factors.

Results

Throughout the study period, there were 91,064 surgical cases, with 118 CAs (0.13% incidence). Anesthesiology alone managed 110 (93.22%) of these cases. The median time between the end of anesthesia to the time of prescribed ophthalmic medication was 156 minutes (first–third interquartile range: 108–219). All patients experienced resolution of symptoms by the morning following their complaint. Compared to the general surgical population, CA patients were older (P < 0.01) and underwent longer surgeries (P < 0.01).

Conclusion

Minor CAs can be safely and effectively managed using an anesthesiology-based approach. Advanced age and longer surgery are confirmed as risk factors for these injuries.

### Early treatment of corneal abrasions and ulcers-estimating clinical and economic outcomes [^114T8LpU]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Corneal ulceration, which is easily countered by early diagnosis and treatment in the Western world, is considered a "silent epidemic" in low-and-middle income countries (LMICs). The main cause of corneal ulcers varies with geographical locations: in developed countries it is typically associated with contact lens wear while in developing countries, corneal ulcers are often due to injury which primarily afflicts labourers involved in agriculture, manufacturing and domestic sectors.,

There is a growing body of published literature showing that treatment of early-stage corneal abrasions leads to good clinical results. If treatment is delayed, the abrasion can be infected (by bacteria, fungi, or parasites) and lead to corneal ulceration. Once the cornea is ulcerated, it develops corneal opacity that adversely affects vision. Delayed presentation of corneal ulcers can result in extensive damage to corneas with consequent loss of vision or loss of the eye.

Patients in LMIC face significant barriers in accessing eye care and infections are often treated only after severe delays, with unintended consequences. The health infrastructure is often poor or entirely lacking, and patients resort to using homemade remedies or traditional healers, thereby delaying the appropriate treatment, As a result, simple corneal abrasions rapidly progress into corneal infections. The patients affected suffer from pain, red and watery eyes and are therefore unable to work resulting in huge financial implications due to lost livelihood and treatment costs.

The LVPEI model of eye care comprises of a centre of excellence in Hyderabad located at the apex of a treatment pyramid. The next level has three tertiary eye care centres (TCs), each serving a population of 5m people (Figure 1). The third tier has twenty-two secondary centres (SCs) located in towns and smaller cities (within 350 km of a TC) predominantly providing basic surgical and diagnostic care, each serving a population of approximately 500,000 patients. A fourth layer of the pyramid consists of 217 primary vision centres (VCs) managed by a 'vision technician' and these are located in the village clusters, each serving approximately 50,000 people. These VCs are supported by the fifth layer, a network of 'vision guardians' (trained eye care volunteers who monitor the eye health of their community members).

### Early treatment of corneal abrasions and ulcers-estimating clinical and economic outcomes [^111p4NSs]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2022). High credibility.

Corneal ulceration is a disease that begins as a simple minor trauma or abrasion but can finally end up with unnecessary and often prolonged physical and financial suffering and is of concern in the population that has limited resources to take care of this problem. Corneal infection in developing nations is estimated to be 10 times more than in developed nations. This being a major and large unmet global health need, WHO has estimated 1.5–2.0 million new cases of unilateral blindness each year worldwide. Despite the high incidence and the poor outcomes, preventative strategies are not common. Whilst use of eye protection during labour is recommended, it is typically not used in India and LMICs, so early diagnosis and treatment is currently the most effective strategy. The underlying objective is to prevent corneal abrasions becoming ulcers, identifying abrasions and initiating appropriate treatment can prevent infection and further referrals to distant higher centres. Also, liberal use of antibiotics is known to cause the rise of anti-microbial resistance and may make future treatment challenging.

With the extensive patient population managed through the LVPEI pyramidal model which has invested in training of village-based eye care workers then the cost is spread across a large patient population. This improves affordability, whereas the costs would be higher in sparsely populated settings or if the incidence of corneal abrasions were lower. In other words, this model of investing in training of low-skilled technical staff distributed to be village based, developed in response to perceived clinical need, is working both clinically and economically.

The LVPEI pyramidal model suggests that patients being treated at the early abrasion stage minimises the costs and achieves good health outcomes. However, delayed treatment, due to some not seeking health care until abrasions become ulcers, results in substantial financial implications with potentially serious health consequences. As the VCs are equipped with teleconsultations facilities, unnecessary travel and loss of income for patients and their families is prevented. The important role played by vision guardians and community health workers with relatively little training is highlighted in this study. They can also play a crucial role to increase awareness among such patients, where the incidence of corneal abrasions in the population is high, other LMICs can follow the LVPEI model and reach out to patients in their local settings.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for corneal abrasion [^115hFczy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Corneal abrasion is a common disorder frequently faced by ophthalmologists, emergency physicians, and primary care physicians. Ocular antibiotics are one of the management options for corneal abrasion. A comprehensive summary and synthesis of the evidence on antibiotic prophylaxis in traumatic corneal abrasion is thus far unavailable, therefore we conducted this review to evaluate the current evidence regarding this important issue.

Objectives

To assess the safety and efficacy of topical antibiotic prophylaxis following corneal abrasion. Our objectives were 1) to investigate the incidence of infection with antibiotics versus placebo or alternative antibiotics in people with corneal abrasion; and 2) to investigate time to clinical cure, defined as complete healing (re-epithelialization) of the epithelium, with antibiotics versus placebo or alternative antibiotics in people with corneal abrasion.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; 2021, Issue 4), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase.com, PubMed, the Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature database (LILACS), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 25 April 2021.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotic with another antibiotic or placebo in children and adults with corneal abrasion due to any cause.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodology and assessed the certainty of the body of evidence for the prespecified outcomes using the GRADE classification.

Main Results

Our search of the electronic databases yielded 8661 records. We screened 7690 titles and abstracts after removal of duplicates. We retrieved 32 full-text reports for further review. We included two studies that randomized a total of 527 eyes of 527 participants in the review. One study was conducted in Denmark, and one was conducted in India. The two studies did not examine most of our prespecified primary and secondary outcomes. The first study was a parallel-group RCT comparing chloramphenicol ocular ointment with fusidic acid ocular gels (frequency was not clearly reported). This study enrolled 153 participants older than 5 years of age with corneal abrasion in Denmark with a one-day follow-up duration. No participants had secondary infection in the fusidic acid group, whereas three (4.1%) participants in the chloramphenicol group had a slight reaction (risk ratio [RR] 0.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01 to 2.79; 144 participants; very low certainty evidence). Thirty-one (44.3%) participants in the fusidic acid arm and 34 (46.6%) participants in the chloramphenicol arm were cured (defined as the area of abrasion zero and no infection) at day 1 (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.34; 144 participants; very low certainty evidence). Without providing specific data, the study reported that the degree of pain was not affected by the interventions received. The most common adverse events reported were itching and discomfort of the eye, which occurred in approximately one-third of participants in each group (low certainty evidence). A second multicenter, two-arm RCT conducted in India enrolled 374 participants older than 5 years of age with corneal abrasion who presented within 48 hours after injury. This study investigated the effect of a three-day course of either ocular ointment combinations of chloramphenicol-clotrimazole or chloramphenicol-placebo (all three times daily). At day 3, 169 (100%) participants in the chloramphenicol-clotrimazole arm and 203 (99%) out of 205 participants in the chloramphenicol-placebo arm were cured without any complication, defined as complete epithelialization of the cornea without evidence of infection (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.03; 374 participants; very low certainty evidence). Four participants assigned to the chloramphenicol-placebo arm experienced mild adverse events: two participants (1%) had mild chemosis and irritation, and two (1%) had small single sterile corneal infiltrates (low certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Given the low to very low certainty of the available evidence, any beneficial effects of antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing ocular infection or accelerating epithelial healing following a corneal abrasion remain unclear. Moreover, the current evidence is insufficient to support any antibiotic regimen being superior to another. There is a need for a well-designed RCT assessing the efficacy and safety of ocular antibiotics in the treatment of corneal abrasion with a particular focus on high-risk populations and formulation of interventions.

### A department-of-anesthesiology-based management protocol for perioperative corneal abrasions [^11541AN2]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

During the study period, patients diagnosed with perioperative CAs were significantly older (P < 0.01) than those in the general surgical population (Figure 3A). The average age of patients diagnosed with CAs was 64.49 years (95% CI: 62.28–66.7), compared to 58.1 years (95% CI: 57.99–58.21) for patients who did not develop these injuries. The median age was 66 years (IQR: 58.75–73) and 59 years (IQR: 48–70) for CA patients and non-CA patients, respectively.

Likewise, patients diagnosed with CA underwent surgeries of significantly longer duration (P < 0.01) than those who were not diagnosed with these injuries (Figure 3B). Compared to patients who were not diagnosed with CA, who had a mean surgical duration of 132.73 minutes (95% CI: 132.04–133.42), the average surgical duration of patients diagnosed with CAs was 207.93 minutes (95% CI: 192.24–223.62). The median surgical duration was 202 minutes (IQR: 149.5–253) and 105 minutes (IQR: 61–166.5) for CA patients and non-CA patients, respectively.

### Early treatment of corneal abrasions and ulcers-estimating clinical and economic outcomes [^112sNeC2]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2022). High credibility.

Methods and data

Corneal abrasion and ulcer pathway

Pathways for management of corneal abrasions and corneal ulcers were developed to identify the key outcomes and cost data that needed to be captured from LVPEI. A detailed pathway for disease progression of corneal abrasion was developed in consultation with clinical experts and this detailed pathway was then consolidated to streamline the outcomes and treatment regimens. Figure 2 shows a simplified overview of outcomes identified in the management of corneal abrasions and ulcers.

Figure 2
Corneal abrasion and ulcer pathway. Healing of corneal abrasion with medical management only, on worsening to corneal ulcer which either heals with medical management only or may need in addition to the medical management, Tissue adhesive and bandage contact lens application (TABCL), or therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty (TPK), or evisceration.

All patients with abrasions could either heal with topical treatment or worsen to corneal ulcers, which could also heal with topical treatment. The current practice for management of patients presenting with abrasion is to use topical antibiotics and with corneal ulcers is to use topical antibiotics and antifungal treatments (which include topical ciprofloxacin, fortified cefazolin, atropine, natamycin and oral ketoconazole), with the dosage and duration depending on the stage of the disease as outlined in the Appendix. Patients with corneal ulcers which do not heal need surgical procedures such as tissue adhesive and bandage contact lenses (TABCL) for treating thinning of the cornea or small perforations, therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty (TPK) for treating large perforations or larger ulcers, or even evisceration if the infection is too widespread in the eye and the eye is not salvageable.

### Early treatment of corneal abrasions and ulcers-estimating clinical and economic outcomes [^113zw9Rs]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2022). High credibility.

Background

In low-and-middle income countries, corneal abrasions and ulcers are common and not always well managed. Previous studies showed better clinical outcomes with early presentation and treatment of minor abrasions, however, there have been no formal studies estimating the financial impact of early treatment of abrasions and ulcers compared to delayed treatment.

Methods

We used the LV Prasad Eye Institute's (LVPEI's) electronic health record system (eyeSmart) to estimate the impact of early presentation on clinical outcomes associated with abrasions and ulcers. 861 patients with corneal abrasion and 1821 patients with corneal ulcers were studied retrospectively, and 134 patients with corneal abrasion prospectively. A health economic model was constructed based on LVPEI cost data for a range of patient scenarios (from early presentation with abrasion to late presentation with ulcer).

Findings

Our findings suggest that delayed presentation of corneal abrasion results in poor clinical and economic outcomes due to increased risk of ulceration requiring more extensive surgical management, increasing associated costs to patients and the healthcare system. However, excellent results at low cost can be achieved by treatment of patients with early presentation of abrasions at village level health care centres.

Interpretation

Treatment of early minor corneal abrasions, particularly using local delivery of treatment, is effective clinically and economically. Future investment in making patients aware of the need to react promptly to corneal abrasions by accessing local healthcare resources (coupled with a campaign to prevent ulcerations occurring) will continue to improve clinical outcomes for patients at low cost and avoid complex and more expensive treatment to preserve sight.

### A department-of-anesthesiology-based management protocol for perioperative corneal abrasions [^112HZuKa]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

CAs occurring perioperatively can arise from multiple factors, including trauma, chemical injury, and corneal edema. Although there is still debate on the frequency with which patients develop CAs, the American Society of Anesthesiologists closed-claims analysis found that CA was the most common ocular injury, accounting for 35% of all such injuries. At our hospital, the overall incidence of CA over the study period was 0.13%, which falls within the range of that observed in other studies.–Year-to-year incidence over the study period was fairly constant, ranging from 0.12% to 0.15%.

In addition to evaluating the efficacy of an anesthesiology-led protocol for managing perioperative CAs and determining their incidence at our hospital, our study sought to further explore the risk factors associated with these injuries. Consistent with previous studies, we confirmed corneal injury to be associated with advanced age and longer surgeries.

Limitations and future studies

Despite collecting the data on CAs in a prospective fashion, this study is observational and faces all of the same limitations associated with a retrospective design. Consequently, findings from this study do not have the strength of those resulting from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, and certain data – such as the specific treatment prescribed and the time to treatment – were unavailable for a handful of patients. Furthermore, the study's retrospective design did not allow for certain data to be readily examined, such as the exact time patients exhibited symptoms of CA. To more accurately determine the time between symptom onset and treatment initiation under an anesthesiology-led protocol for the management of CAs, future studies could document the time patients complain of eye pain prospectively. Having patient complaint serve as the primary mechanism by which perioperative CAs are identified can in itself be somewhat of a limitation, as those patients who do indeed develop CAs but do not experience acute pain in the recovery room will have their treatment delayed. Additionally, because this study was conducted only at one institution without an ophthalmologist readily available, some of its findings may not be generalizable to other sites. Finally, despite the fact that our database included over 90,000 patients, the number of CAs recorded was too small to perform more complex etiology-based analysis.

### Management of corneal abrasion in children: a randomized clinical trial [^112TfJFK]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We compare percentage of healing, comfort, and complications in children with corneal abrasions treated with an eye patch versus no eye patch.

Methods

We performed a randomized clinical trial of patients aged 3 to 17 years who were diagnosed with isolated corneal abrasion. Patients were randomly assigned to an eye patch or no patch group. Abrasion size was documented with digital photographs and/or an eye template diagram at presentation and at 20- to 24-hour follow-up examination. A reviewer masked to treatment group determined percent healing by measuring presentation and follow-up abrasion sizes on the photographs/template. At follow-up, interference with activities of daily living (ADL) was measured with a visual analog scale and the number of pain medication doses taken since presentation was recorded.

Results

A total of 37 patients were enrolled: 17 with an eye patch and 18 with no eye patch. The mean patient age was 10 years, and two thirds of the patients were male. The majority (86%) of patients had 95% or more healing at follow-up, and there was no significant difference in percent healing between the 2 groups, even when adjusted for age and initial abrasion size (95% confidence interval [CI] for the difference in means -11 to 8 and -13 to 5, respectively). There was no difference between groups for number of pain medication doses required. Among measurements of interference with ADL, only the difficulty walking score was found to be significantly different between groups (patch mean 1.7 cm [SD 2.1 cm] versus no patch mean 0.3 cm [SD 0.7 cm]; 95% CI for the difference in means 0.3 to 2.5).

Conclusion

This study suggests that eye patching in children with corneal abrasions makes no difference in the rate of healing. There was no difference in discomfort and interference with ADL, other than greater difficulty walking in the patch group, and there were no complications in either group.

### A department-of-anesthesiology-based management protocol for perioperative corneal abrasions [^112pZiUB]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Except for two patients who were referred to an ophthalmologist by the Department of Anesthesiology, all patients managed by Anesthesiology improved with conservative management, and were followed until symptoms abated. Out of the 110 patients seen exclusively by Anesthesiology, 85 experienced resolution of symptoms with artificial tears alone, nine with artificial tears followed by 0.5% erythromycin ophthalmic ointment, and eight with artificial tears followed by an alternative treatment (Table 2). Treatment information was not available for eight of the patients diagnosed with CA.

Using the anesthesiology-led protocol algorithm to identify symptoms of perioperative CA within the recovery room, anesthesiologists managed the care of 117 out of the 118 patients who presented with CAs within a few hours of their surgeries. Because the one patient who was identified outside of this window did not present with symptoms of CA until after she was extubated 2 days following her surgery, she was excluded from our calculation of time to treatment. Out of the remaining 117 cases of perioperative CA, data on time to treatment were available for 100 (84.55%). Mean time to treatment for these 100 patients was 177.84 (95% CI: 158.1–197.58), with a median time to treatment of 156 minutes (IQR: 108–219). The distribution of time to treatment for patients with CA is represented by the density histogram with the overlaying probability density function in Figure 2. Time to treatment was within 135 minutes for 39.0% of patients, within 180 minutes for 63.0% of patients, and within 225 minutes for 77.0% of patients. For only eight out of these 100 patients (8.0%) was the time to treatment greater than 315 minutes, and for only two (2.0%) was this interval greater than 495 minutes.

### Early treatment of corneal abrasions and ulcers-estimating clinical and economic outcomes [^112xxMTs]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show the costs and outcomes of early management of corneal abrasions and to show the increasing cost and the complexity of the management as the delay increases. We developed a de novo model to estimate the costs and clinical outcomes of different scenarios for diagnosis and treatment of corneal ulcer. The model is based on robust prospective and retrospective data from a large representative sample of LVPEI patients in different treatment settings. Furthermore, cost data was based on bottom-up costing for the different health care and patient costs, based on the type of treatment and the treatment setting. Data analysis suggested that the clinical outcomes are better when patients present early, and when the ulcers are small. Scenario modelling showed clearly that the best outcomes and lowest costs are when patients present early at the abrasion stage and the costs when patients present with ulcers are substantially higher along with poorer outcomes, especially when presenting late with large ulcers at TCs.

Our study confirms previous findings that patients who present early with small abrasions experience a better clinical outcome than those presenting late with infected ulcers. Upadhyay et al. performed a two-year study on 34,902 individuals in Nepal and reported that prophylactic antibiotics after corneal abrasion can help avoid corneal ulceration (with only 4% of the patients developing ulcers which is similar to the rates observed in our study), with earlier treatment associated with better clinical outcomes similar to the findings in our study. Getshen et al. have reported no cases of ulceration in Bhutan, when the abrasions were treated within 48 hours with antibiotics. Similar findings were reported from Burma when topical antifungal and antibacterial were combined and no ulcers were reported. Srinivasan et al. have reported a similar regimen used in South India looking at topical antibiotics and a placebo group and compared with topical antibiotics and antifungals and reported healing in 98.5% of patients with few having adverse events and two developed infiltrates in the placebo group which were microbiologically sterile and managed with Natamycin eye drops. Recent studies by Srinivasan et al. and O'Brien et al. did not find any difference in the reduction of the incidence of corneal ulceration in community-based corneal ulcer prevention programme. Whilst our study was not randomized, given the sample size in our study and the broad catchment area (LVPEI covers fours states of India and has patients reporting from all over the country), we believe LVPEI is representative of the general population in India.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for corneal abrasion [^113b32d2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Corneal abrasion is a condition frequently treated by eye care professionals, emergency physicians, and primary care physicians. Topical ophthalmic antibiotics are the most common therapy for corneal abrasion. However, there has been no comprehensive summary and synthesis of the evidence regarding antibiotic prophylaxis in traumatic corneal abrasion. In this review update, we evaluated the current evidence regarding the benefits and harms of antibiotic treatment for this relatively common emergency condition. This is an update of a review published in 2022.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of topical antibiotic prophylaxis for corneal abrasion.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase.com, two other databases, and two trials registries together with reference checking to identify studies that are included in the review. The latest search date was 28 March 2025.

Eligibility Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing an antibiotic with another antibiotic or with placebo in children and adults with corneal abrasion(s).

Outcomes

Outcomes included the following: risk of any ocular infection up to one month following corneal abrasion, proportion of eyes healed within 48 hours, participant-reported pain intensity reduction of 50% or more at 24 hours, loss of one or more lines of best-corrected visual acuity at one month, change in pain interference from baseline to 24 hours, complications of corneal abrasion, and treatment-related adverse events at the longest follow-up.

Risk Of Bias

Using the Cochrane risk of bias (RoB) 2 tool, we assessed the RoB for the three reported outcomes.

Synthesis Methods

We synthesized results for each outcome using meta-analysis by calculating risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes where possible; otherwise, we summarized the results narratively. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for prespecified outcomes.

Included Studies

We included four RCTs enrolling a total of 998 participants, ranging from 20 to 437 participants. The included studies were published from 1975 to 1998, and conducted in Denmark (1), the Republic of Korea (1), and the UK (2). The length of follow-up was 24 hours to four weeks, or unspecified in two studies. Two studies had industry support. Participants had a mean age of 35 years (range 5 to 80 years) in one study, while the other three studies reported age ranges from 15 to 64 years. Most participants had traumatic corneal abrasions, commonly following foreign body removal. Two studies compared topical antibiotics with placebo (vehicle ointment or sodium hyaluronic acid drops), while three studies compared chloramphenicol ointment with antibiotics from other classes. One study was a three-arm study that compared two antibiotic regimens and one vehicle control. We judged the risk of bias from one study as raising some concerns about two efficacy outcomes, and three studies as having a high risk of overall bias across three outcomes.

Synthesis Of Results

We classified study interventions into two comparisons: 1) antibiotics versus placebo, and 2) chloramphenicol versus other classes of antibiotics. Overall, we judged the certainty of evidence as very low for all outcomes due to imprecision, indirectness, and risk of bias. Two studies compared antibiotics with placebo. For one study, we combined the data for the sulfacetamide sodium and chloramphenicol ointment groups and compared them with a vehicle control group in a three-arm study. This study suggested that antibiotics may increase the risk of ocular infection (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.70; 1 study, 320 participants). The same study found little to no difference in healing within 48 hours (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.00). Another study compared tobramycin with sodium hyaluronic acid and reported complete healing in most eyes by 48 hours, with no incidence of infection; however, the study was not included in the meta-analysis because of unit-of-analysis issues. One study reported severe allergic reactions to medication or other adverse events leading to participant withdrawal. The analysis showed no evidence of a difference in treatment-related adverse events between antibiotics and placebo (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.47; 1 study, 437 participants). Another study reported no adverse events in both arms but was not included in the analysis because it was unclear how the outcomes were measured. Three studies compared chloramphenicol with other classes of antibiotics (fusidic acid or sulfacetamide sodium). The pooled analysis showed little to no difference in the risk of ocular infection within one month (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.31; 3 studies, 651 participants). One study reported no positive cultures in either group, although minor inflammatory signs (e.g. conjunctival hyperemia) were noted in the chloramphenicol arm. For corneal healing within 48 hours, three studies assessed cure rates within 24 hours using slightly different definitions, but the pooled analysis again showed no clinically meaningful difference between groups (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.06; 3 studies, 651 participants). Two studies found no evidence of a difference in the incidence of treatment-related adverse events between groups (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.17; 2 studies, 677 participants). Another study reported that one-third of participants in both groups experienced discomfort or itching, although these outcomes were not reported separately by each treatment arm. For both comparisons, none of the included studies reported the following prespecified outcomes: participant-reported pain intensity reduction of 50% or more at 24 hours, loss of one or more lines of best-corrected visual acuity at one month, change in pain interference from baseline to 24 hours, and complications of corneal abrasion up to the longest follow-up.

Authors' Conclusions

Given that the evidence supporting antibiotic use in corneal abrasion is of very low certainty, we are not able to support a specific antibiotic regimen or draw conclusions about the effects of antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing ocular infection or accelerating epithelial healing. Future research could explore adequately powered RCTs or alternative approaches, such as target trial emulation, while focusing on high-risk populations and antibiotic formulations.

### Topical pain control for corneal abrasions: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1151F6x3]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Corneal abrasions are common ophthalmic presentations to emergency departments. Among emergency physicians and ophthalmologists, there are highly variable practice patterns with regard to management of resultant pain and discomfort. The goal of this study was to review and analyze the efficacy and safety of topical pain therapies for corneal abrasions, including topical anesthetics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), cycloplegics, steroids, pressure patching, and the use of a bandage contact lens (BCL).

Methods

The review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. The protocol was established a priori and published on PROSPERO (CRD42020201288). MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and Web of Science were searched until December 31, 2020. Primary studies comparing topical pain therapies to another therapy or control were included. Primary outcomes included percentage of corneal abrasions healed at 24, 48, and 72 hours, as well as pain control at 24 and 48 hours. Secondary outcomes included use of oral analgesia and incidence of complications. Risk of bias was assessed using validated tools. Quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE methodology.

Results

Overall, 33 studies (31 randomized controlled trials [RCTs], two cohort studies) comprising 4,167 patients with corneal abrasions were analyzed. Only the data for topical NSAIDs were of adequate evidence from which to draw conclusions; topical NSAIDs demonstrated significantly reduced pain scores at 24 hours (standardized mean differences [SMD] -0.69, 95% CI = -0.98 to -0.41) and 48 hours (SMD = -0.56, 95% CI = -1.02 to -0.10) as well as 53% (95% CI = 34% to 67%) lower oral analgesia use compared to control. Based on available data, topical anesthetics, cycloplegics, patching, and the use of a BCL did not result in any significant difference in pain scores or use of oral analgesia, while no studies examined topical steroids. No interventions resulted in healing delays or significantly higher rates of complications compared to controls.

Conclusions

There was strong evidence to support that topical NSAIDs reduce pain associated with corneal abrasions in the first 48 hours and the need for oral analgesia. The existing evidence was insufficient to support or refute the use of topical anesthetics, cycloplegics, steroids, or BCL for pain control in corneal abrasions. Pressure patching was ineffective at pain reduction and may increase the risk of complications. Delays in healing or other complications were not significantly different between any intervention or control for simple, uncomplicated corneal abrasions; however, larger RCTs are required to identify any differences in rare complications.

### Emergency management of corneal injuries [^116V2brL]. Injury (2007). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Corneal injuries account for a significant proportion of the ophthalmic workload of most emergency departments. Although the vast majority of cases are relatively minor, accurate diagnosis and appropriate management are vital to prevent potentially sight-threatening sequelae. We present a survey of corneal injury cases at a general emergency department.

Introduction

Corneal injuries are very common in both the adult and paediatric population and account for a significant proportion of the workload of most emergency departments. This survey assesses management of corneal injury cases at a general emergency department.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective case study was performed of 100 patients consecutively diagnosed with a corneal abrasion by slit lamp examination at the emergency department of the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London. Each case was assessed to determine documentation of set criteria including visual acuity (VA), treatment and grade of examiner.

Results

The commonest cause of injury was direct minor trauma (64% of cases) with contact lens related problems accounting for 12% of presentations. VA was documented correctly in 85 adult patients (90.4% of adults), incorrectly in 2 cases, and not documented at all in 7 adults (7.4%). VA was not recorded in paediatric cases. All cases were treated with topical chloramphenicol drops although frequency of treatment ranged from 2 to 5 times daily and duration of treatment ranged between 3 and 5 days and for 7 days. 6 cases (6%) were assessed by an emergency nurse practitioner and the remaining number were seen by a casualty officer.

Discussion

VA must be accurately documented in all adult cases and should be documented in children of school age. A pinhole test should be performed in cases where VA is below 6/9. For analgesia, the use of topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, lubricants and bandage contact lens should be considered. Emergency nurse practitioners and general practitioners are ideally placed to follow-up uncomplicated cases.

### Bacterial keratitis preferred practice pattern ® [^112BzxJW]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Corneal abrasion prophylaxis — Topical antibiotics should be prescribed to prevent acute infection in patients with a corneal abrasion who wear contact lenses or suffered trauma, and in these patients, patching the eye early on is not advised because these increase the risk of secondary bacterial keratitis.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for treatment of eye injuries and illnesses in the wilderness: 2024 update [^11785W4r]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Corneal abrasion — field management emphasizes topical therapy, pain control, and avoiding patching, with graded recommendations provided. Corneal abrasions in the wilderness should be treated with topical antibiotics (such as erythromycin ophthalmic 0.5% ointment 1 cm every 8 h), cycloplegics (such as atropine 1%, 1 drop every 8 h), NSAIDs (such as ketorolac 0.5%, 1 drop every 6 h), and frequent use of artificial tears; sunglasses may help reduce photophobia, but there is no evidence to support eye patching, and bandage soft contact lenses should be used only if there is no retained corneal foreign body, they are used with a prophylactic topical antibiotic drop, and they are removed within 24 to 48 h. Topical anesthetic eye drops provide acute relief but prolonged use should be avoided because they are potentially toxic to the corneal epithelium; a recent randomized trial of tetracaine versus saline for uncomplicated abrasions concluded there was no significant difference in corneal healing with an overall patient perception of improved pain control. Recommendation grades include: Topical antibiotics — Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence; Cycloplegics — Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence; NSAIDs — Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence; Artificial tears — Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence; Sunglasses — Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence; Avoidance of patching — Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence; Emergent evacuation for open globe or deep epithelial defects — Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.

### Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for analgesia in traumatic corneal abrasions [^117Jxk2f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Traumatic corneal abrasions are relatively common and there is a lack of consensus about analgesia in their management. It is therefore important to document the clinical efficacy and safety profile of topical ophthalmic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the management of traumatic corneal abrasions.

Objectives

To identify and evaluate all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the use of topical NSAIDs with placebo or any alternative analgesic interventions in adults with traumatic corneal abrasions (including corneal abrasions arising from foreign body removal), to reduce pain, and its effects on healing time.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2017, Issue 2), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 30 March 2017), Embase Ovid (1947 to 30 March 2017), LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database) (1982 to 30 March 2017), OpenGrey (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe) (www.opengrey.eu/); searched 30 March 2017, ZETOC (1993 to 30 March 2017), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch); searched 30 March 2017, ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov); searched 30 March 2017 and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en); searched 30 March 2017. We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We checked the reference lists of identified trials to search for further potentially relevant studies.

Selection Criteria

RCTs comparing topical NSAIDs to placebo or any alternative analgesic interventions in adults with traumatic corneal abrasions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed data extraction and assessed risks of bias in the included studies. We rated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included nine studies that met the inclusion criteria, reporting data on 637 participants. The studies took place in the UK, USA, Israel, Italy, France and Portugal. These studies compared five types of topical NSAIDs (0.1% indomethacin, 0.03% flurbiprofen, 0.5% ketorolac, 1% indomethacin, 0.1% diclofenac) to control (consisting of standard care and in four studies used placebo eye drops). Overall, the studies were at an unclear or high risk of bias (particularly selection and reporting bias). None of the included studies reported the primary outcome measures of this review, namely participant-reported pain intensity reduction of 30% or more or 50% or more at 24 hours. Four trials, that included data on 481 participants receiving NSAIDs or control (placebo/standard care), reported on the use of 'rescue' analgesia at 24 hours as a proxy measure of pain control. Topical NSAIDs were associated with a reduction in the need for oral analgesia compared with control (risk ratio (RR) 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 0.61; low-certainty evidence). Approximately 4 out of 10 people in the control group used rescue analgesia at 24 hours. No data were available on the use of analgesia at 48 or 72 hours. One trial (28 participants) reported on the proportion of abrasions healed after 24 and 48 hours. These outcomes were similar in both arms of the trial. (at 24 hours RR 1.00 (0.81 to 1.23); at 48 hours RR 1.00 (0.88 to 1.14); low-certainty evidence). In the control group nine out of 10 abrasions were healed within 24 hours and all were healed by 48 hours. Complications of corneal abrasions were reported in 6 studies (609 participants) and were infrequently reported (4 complications, 1 in NSAID groups (recurrent corneal erosion) and 3 in control groups (2 recurrent corneal erosions and 1 corneal abscess), very low-certainty evidence). Possible drug-related adverse events (AEs) were reported in two trials (163 participants), with the number of adverse events low (4 AEs, 3 in NSAID group, including discomfort/photophobia on instillation, conjunctival hyperaemia and urticaria, and 1 in the control group, corneal abscess) very low-certainty evidence.

Authors' Conclusions

The findings of the included studies do not provide strong evidence to support the use of topical NSAIDs in traumatic corneal abrasions. This is important, since NSAIDs are associated with a higher cost compared to oral analgesics. None of the trials addressed our primary outcome measure of participant-reported pain intensity reduction of 30% or more or 50% or more at 24 hours.

### Cochrane corner: topical anaesthetics for pain control following corneal abrasions [^116omwNB]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Topical anaesthetics had little or no effect in reducing self-reported pain for traumatic or surgically created abrasions from baseline to 24 h compared to an inactive control. However, based on low certainty evidence from one trial of participants with traumatic abrasions, anaesthetics may lower pain scores at 24–48 h. Only one post-surgical RCT reported on pain control up to 72 h and found that the intervention had little or no effect on post-surgical pain. Overall, for the trials included in the quantitative analysis, there was no significant reduction in resolution of epithelial defects between anaesthetic and control groups, nor in the proportion of eyes with complications, although the certainty of the evidence is very low for all safety outcomes mostly because of risk of bias and small sample sizes.

In recent years, Cochrane Eyes and Vision have produced a suite of reviews that have examined the management of corneal abrasions. The findings of this latest review are unlikely to change practice and convince the eye care community of the safety of supplying topical anaesthetics for pain relief, even if provided in limited dose-vials and used for short periods. The review authors acknowledge that they had very low confidence in the efficacy data. Furthermore, the effect sizes for pain reduction were generally small and typically less than two units lower with anaesthetic on a 10-point VAS pain scale. Studies in emergency settings have attempted to define the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) for acute pain severity by measuring the change in VAS score associated with adequate pain control. A mean reduction in VAS of at least 30% was found to represent a clinically important difference in pain severity that corresponded to patients' perception of adequate pain control.

Although there were no safety concerns arising from the included trials, the review authors do not discount the potential for ocular morbidity, particularly in a 'real world' setting where patients are not as closely monitored as in the experimental studies. The growing opioid crisis in the United States has created an impetus for opioid-sparing pain management and this may explain the desire to seek alternative methods to control pain arising from corneal-abrasion associated pain in the emergency department. However, further research is still needed, with larger, better-quality trials and longer follow up times to provide the evidence base needed to justify a change in practice.

### Wilderness Medical Society practice guidelines for treatment of eye injuries and illnesses in the wilderness [^1116vYAa]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Corneal abrasion — treatment and indications for evacuation: Prompt removal of evident corneal foreign body is recommended, and if open globe is suspected or deep corneal epithelial defects are apparent, then evacuation is emergent. Treatment includes topical antibiotics (erythromycin ophthalmic 0.5% ointment 1 cm every 8 hours), cycloplegics (atropine 1%, 1 drop every 8 hours), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; ketorolac 0.5%, 1 drop every 8 hours), and frequent artificial tears. Sunglasses may help photophobia, but there is no evidence to support eye patching. Bandage soft contact lenses should be used only when no retained corneal foreign body is present, they are paired with a prophylactic topical antibiotic drop, and they are removed within 24 to 48 hours. Topical anesthetic eye drops provide diagnostic and acute pain relief but should not be used chronically due to corneal epithelial toxicity. Recommendation categories are Topical antibiotics: 1A; Cycloplegics: 1A; NSAIDs: 1A; Artificial tears: 1C; Sunglasses: 1C.

### A department-of-anesthesiology-based management protocol for perioperative corneal abrasions [^116Lfj5s]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Results

Over the study period, a total of 91,064 non-ocular surgical patients (except pediatric and obstetric) were followed. A total of 171 eye complaints were recorded and investigated. Table 1 represents the number of eye complaints, CAs, patients treated by an anesthesiologist, patients treated by an ophthalmologist, and associated event frequency. Out of the total number of surgical patients in this time period, 118 stained positive for a CA for an incidence of 0.13% (or 1.3 per 1,000 surgeries). Out of these 118 patients, 110 were seen only by an anesthesiologist, while eight received an ophthalmology consult, including six referred to an ophthalmologist at the request of either the patient (two) or the surgeon (four). Therefore, the anesthesia department successfully managed 93.22% of the perioperative CAs. The annual frequency of CA is also presented in Table 1. Incidence was consistent over the 5-year observational period, ranging between 0.12% and 0.15%.

### Safety and effectiveness of topical anesthetics in corneal abrasions: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112iP8rA]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Topical anesthetics are used in the emergency department (ED) to relieve eye pain and allow eye examinations in patients with corneal abrasions. There is concern for delayed corneal healing, which is associated with the long-term use of topical anesthetics, so outpatient use is not recommended.

Objectives

We sought to systematically study the effectiveness and complications associated with the short-term use of topical anesthetics (≤ 72 hours) in the management of patients presenting to EDs with corneal abrasions.

Methods

Four electronic databases were searched from inception of the database until April 2014. We included studies of patients > 16 years of age who were using topical anesthetics for < 72 hours. Postoperative cases were not included.

Results

A total of 140 patients (68 in the intervention group and 72 in the control group) from 2 randomized trials were included in the analysis. Comparing control patients who did not use topical anesthetics to study patients who did use topical anesthetics, this meta-analysis found no significant difference in pain scores (standardized mean difference -1.01 [95% confidence interval {CI} -2.39 to 0.38), corneal healing (OR 1.31 [95% CI 0.53–3.27), or persistent symptoms (OR 0.98 [95% CI 0.06–16.69). The 2 trials reported no adverse effects.

Conclusion

There were no differences regarding pain, persistent symptoms, or corneal healing when comparing short-term use of topical anesthetics to placebo in the treatment of corneal abrasion. Data on safety are sparse, and the use of this treatment is currently not supported by evidence.

### Management of the red eye for the primary care physician [^114ebvtV]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

For the primary care physician, the occurrence of a red eye is a frequent and prominent finding of a disease process in patients. A careful history and simple examination with the observation of typical clinical signs are important for the management of this common disorder. The causes can be classified as painful red eye, trauma, and other common conditions. The most frequent causes of a red eye, such as dry eye, conjunctivitis, keratitis, iritis, acute glaucoma, subconjunctival hematoma, foreign bodies, corneal abrasion, and blunt or penetrating trauma, are described in this article. Simple diagnostic methods and an emergency management with some useful topical ophthalmic preparations are included. Although several conditions can be treated by the primary care physician the clinical signs that require an urgent ophthalmic consultation are chemical burns, intraocular infections, globe ruptures or perforations, and acute glaucoma.

### Corneal injury after routine gastrointestinal endoscopy with moderate sedation [^116RLwPh]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, corneal abrasion is a painful and potentially serious complication of moderate sedation during GI endoscopy. We suspect this complication is an under-recognized and underreported complication of GI endoscopy. It is important for endoscopists and staff to be aware of its possible occurrence, so that effective prevention, diagnosis and management of this potentially serious complication may be achieved.

### Patching for corneal abrasion [^116vTb33]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Published audits have demonstrated that corneal abrasions are a common presenting eye complaint. Eye patches are often recommended for treating corneal abrasions despite the lack of evidence for their use. This systematic review was conducted to determine the effects of the eye patch when used to treat corneal abrasions.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of patching for corneal abrasion on healing and pain relief.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2016, Issue 4), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to May 2016), EMBASE (January 1980 to May 2016), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (January 1982 to May 2016), System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (OpenGrey) (January 1995 to May 2016), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 9 May 2016. We also searched the reference lists of included studies, unpublished 'grey' literature and conference proceedings and contacted pharmaceutical companies for details of unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared patching the eye with no patching to treat simple corneal abrasions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. Investigators were contacted for further information regarding the quality of trials. The primary outcome was healing at 24, 48 and 72 hours while secondary outcomes included measures of pain, quality of life and adverse effects. We graded the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 12 trials which randomised a total of 1080 participants in the review. Four trials were conducted in the United Kingdom, another four in the United States of America, two in Canada, one in Brazil and one in Switzerland. Seven trials were at high risk of bias in one or more domains and one trial was judged to be low risk of bias in all domains. The rest were a combination of low risk or unclear. People receiving a patch may be less likely to have a healed corneal abrasion after 24 hours compared to those not receiving a patch (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 1.00, 7 trials, 531 participants, low certainty evidence). Similar numbers of people in the patch and no-patch groups were healed by 48 hours (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.02, 6 trials, 497 participants, moderate certainty evidence) and 72 hours (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.05, 4 trials, 430 participants, moderate certainty evidence). Participants receiving a patch took slightly longer to heal but the difference was small and probably unimportant (mean difference (MD) 0.14 days longer, 95% CI 0 to 0.27 days longer, 6 trials, 642 participants, moderate certainty evidence). Ten trials reported pain scores. Most studies reported pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS). It was not possible to pool the data because it was skewed. In general, similar pain ratings were seen between patch and no-patch groups. Data from two trials reporting presence or absence of pain at 24 hours was inconclusive. There was a higher risk of reported pain in the patch group but wide confidence intervals compatible with higher or lower risk of pain (RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.86 to 2.65, 2 trials, 193 participants, low certainty evidence). Five trials compared analgesic use between the patch and no-patch groups. Data from three of these trials could be combined and suggested similar analgesic use in the patch and no-patch groups but with some uncertainty (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.32, 256 participants, low certainty evidence). Frequently reported symptoms included photophobia, lacrimation, foreign body sensation and blurred vision but there was little evidence to suggest any difference in these symptoms in people with or without a patch. Activities of daily living (ADL) were assessed in one study involving children. There was little difference in ADL with the exception of walking which was reported to be more difficult with a patch on: VAS 1.7 cm (SD 2.1) versus 0.3 cm (SD 0.7). Complication rates were low across studies and there is uncertainty about the relative effects of patching or not patching with respect to these (RR 3.24, 95% CI 0.87 to 12.05, 8 trials, 660 participants, low certainty evidence). Three trials reporting rates of compliance to treatment found that 22% of participants did not have their eye patches during follow-up. No-patch groups generally received more adjuvant treatment with antibiotics or cycloplegics, or both, than the patch group. There were limited data on the effect of patching on abrasions greater than 10 mm² in size.

Authors' Conclusions

Trials included in this review suggest that treating simple corneal abrasions with a patch may not improve healing or reduce pain. It must be noted that, in these trials, participants who did not receive a patch were more likely to receive additional treatment, for example with antibiotics. Overall we judged the certainty of evidence to be moderate to low. Further research should focus on designing and implementing better quality trials and examining the effectiveness of patching for large abrasions.

### Topical ophthalmic anesthetics for corneal abrasions: findings from a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis [^113mMCin]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

A smaller systematic review of topical anesthetics for traumatic abrasions that includes 2 trials in this current review similarly concludes that topical anesthetic use is "currently not supported by evidence". One summary (not a systematic review) of interventions for post-PRK pain recommends against the long-term use of topical anesthetics. Authors of another summary (not a systematic review) state topical anesthetics do not delay epithelial healing. A third highlights the need for careful monitoring. The small reviewexcludes a trial we had included, and all three exclude two non-English language trials that we had included. The American Academy of Ophthalmology's 2022 Refractive Surgery Preferred Practice Pattern ® states "small quantities of dilute topical anesthetic are sometimes used but warrant close supervision". Treatment guidelines and point-of-care resources generally cite case reports and series when recommending against the use of topical anesthetics for pain control. In the United Kingdom, authors of the Clinical Knowledge Summary by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) state that topical anesthetic can be used to aid examination but "repeat doses should be avoided as they can cause corneal epithelium toxicity and impair healing". The indications approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration do not include pain for corneal abrasion. Instead, labeling for proparacaine and tetracaine specify they are approved for diagnostic and surgical indications, can cause permanent corneal damage, and are not intended for patient self-administration.

### Topical ophthalmic anesthetics for corneal abrasions: findings from a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis [^116qSei8]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Data collection and risk of bias

Authors independently extracted the following data from included studies: trial characteristics, methods, participants, interventions, outcomes, and source of funding. Two review authors independently applied the Cochrane's Risk of Bias version 2 (RoB2) toolto assess risk of bias in the efficacy outcome (pain control by 48 h) and the safety outcome (complications at the longest follow-up time). We judged each study that reported either outcome to have been at "low risk", "high risk" or raising some concerns for risk of bias. An overall Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) assessment of the certainty level of evidence was performed based on four main criteria: risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, and imprecision. We judged the certainty of evidence to be "high", "moderate", "low", or "very low" for the review outcomes. Disagreements were resolved by discussion within the author team.

Data analysis and synthesis

For the continuous outcome of pain assessment, we estimated the mean difference i (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For dichotomous outcomes, we estimated the risk ratios (RR) with 95% CI. We estimated the risk difference (RD) with 95% CI for trials reporting no events in either treatment group.

To determine whether results could be combined in meta-analyses, we assessed the trials for clinical and methodological heterogeneity in trial design, eligibility of trial participants, intervention and comparator differences, and outcome definitions. We evaluated the amount of statistical heterogeneity using the I² statistic outlined in the Cochrane Handbook.

Institutional review board approval was not required for this systematic review.

### Corneal abrasions in total joint arthroplasty [^111aGzq6]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Corneal abrasion (CA) is a condition where the epithelial layer of the cornea is removed from the underlying basement membrane, leading to a defect in the corneal epithelial surface. Although most corneal abrasions heal without significant long-term complications, the patient can experience intense discomfort, tearing, photophobia, and blurred vision in the affected eye. Although rare, CA may result in ocular complications such as persistent corneal defect, corneal infection, and recurrent erosions.CA is the most common ophthalmic complication to occur under general anesthesia (GA). - In a time where enhanced recovery after anesthesia (ERAS) protocols are employed to expedite recovery, this can potentially limit early mobilization. Current literature reports the incidence of CA to range between 0.013% and 0.17% for nonocular surgeries.- The American Society of Anesthesiologists closed-claims analysis found that perioperative CA was the single most common of all perioperative ophthalmic injuries. While relatively benign, injuries such as this may lead to delays in discharge from the hospital due to the need for ophthalmology consultation and management and a halt in ERAS protocols and increased treatment costs. It can also result in a decrease in patient satisfaction surrounding the hospital stay.

Lateral and prone positioning in surgery have been previously implicated in corneal abrasion events. The literature reports incidents of corneal abrasions in nonocular surgeries, specifically spine and cardiac surgeries. There is a paucity of literature on the incidence of CA in orthopedic surgery, specifically total joint arthroplasty (TJA). Here, we present a report of two patients who sustained perioperative CA injury during TJA surgeries performed in the lateral decubitus position. We also sought to review the literature on eye CA and other important injuries during joint replacement to give surgeons guidance to prevent these injuries.

### Patching for corneal abrasion [^1174HynG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Recent audits show that corneal abrasion is a common presenting eye complaint. Eye patches are often recommended for treating corneal abrasions despite the lack of evidence for their use. This systematic review was conducted to determine the effects of the eye patch when used to treat corneal abrasions.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to test the hypothesis that patching an eye following a corneal abrasion improves healing or provides pain relief.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) on The Cochrane Library (2005, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2005), EMBASE (1980 to April 2005), LILACS (13 April 2005), NRR (2005, Issue 2) and SIGLE (December 2004). There were no language or date restrictions in the searches. We also searched the reference lists of included studies, unpublished 'grey' literature and conference proceedings and contacted pharmaceutical companies for details of unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared patching the eye with no patching to treat simple corneal abrasions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted investigators for further information regarding quality of trials. The primary outcome was healing of the corneal epithelium and secondary outcomes were related to pain.

Main Results

Eleven trials, which randomised a total of 1014 participants, were included in the review. Meta-analysis of seven studies with dichotomous healing outcomes favoured no patching on the first day of healing (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.79 to 0.99). For days two and three there was no significant difference between the two groups. Of the nine trials that measured pain scores two favoured no patching and none favoured patching. Complication rates were low and no differences were noted in these between the two groups. No-patch groups generally received more adjuvant treatment with antibiotics and/or cycloplegics than the patch group which is an important confounding factor.

Authors' Conclusions

Treating simple corneal abrasions with a patch does not improve healing rates on the first day post-injury and does not reduce pain. In addition, use of patches results in a loss of binocular vision. Therefore it is recommended that patches should not be used for simple corneal abrasions. Further research should focus on large (greater than 10 mm²) abrasions.

### Fingernail-induced corneal abrasions: case series from an ophthalmology emergency department [^114Zen4H]. Cornea (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Fingernail-induced corneal abrasions are one of the most common eye injuries that present to the emergency department, and yet there is little literature available to offer guidelines for management. We analyzed the treatment used in cases of fingernail-induced corneal abrasions that presented to the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary Emergency Department and studied its relationship to the development of complications such as recurrent erosion syndrome and infection.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of 99 patients who presented to the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary Emergency Department with fingernail-induced corneal abrasions between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2009. We followed the patients for 12 months and documented demographics, nature of the injury, treatment, and complications.

Results

The average age was 29.4 (range, 2–89) years. Forty-four percent (n = 44) were female and 56% (n = 55) were male. Of the 99 subjects, 39 had a full 12 month follow-up, and 7 developed a complication from the injury. Compared with the 32 subjects without complications, there was no difference in age or gender. However, there was a significant difference in that adults scratched by another adult were more highly represented in the group with complications (43%, n = 3/7 vs. 3%, n = 1/32; P = 0.0017). There was no significant difference in outcome by treatment used.

Conclusions

This is the largest fingernail-induced corneal abrasion study completed to date. Patients are at risk of developing complications, but there is scant evidenced-based literature available for treating this common injury. Prospective trials should be performed to better optimize and standardize treatments.

### Pain care for patients with epidermolysis bullosa: best care practice guidelines [^113Y9gjr]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Back pain

Older patients with EB can have back pain. Beyond osteopenia-related issues, biomechanical causes can be involved. Foot blisters and painful hyperkeratosis can cause abnormal gait and compensatory postures. Further, impaired mobility can add a myofascial component to pain. Management of back pain includes optimal foot care, assessment of primary and secondary mechanical factors, evaluation and treatment of osteopenia and fractures, physical therapy, standard analgesics and CBT interventions. Back pain treatment in the EB population is extrapolated from basic principles recommended for the general population, for lack of EB-specific evidence (see Box 6).

NSAIDs are routinely used for bone and joint pain of a variety of types and are appropriate for these types of pain in EB. Care should be taken to monitor for side effects, and the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors may be useful in those patients who experience improved pain control but note increasing blood loss from wounds, or who have gastrointestinal upset with standard NSAIDs. Acetaminophen does not affect bleeding and can be useful. Tramadol and opioids are also useful for more severe pain. Some prefer use of long-acting opioid preparations, with methadone being the only one available in liquid form. Limitations in methadone use are discussed in sub-section on systemic approaches under Skin and Wound Pain.

Good practice points

Bone health should be optimized with calcium and vitamin D supplements as needed, maintenance of maximum mobility, minimization of joint deformity and monitoring for/treatment of pubertal delay. Routine screening for bone mineral density may be useful to ascertain cases of osteopenia before they progress to osteoporosis and fractures. Care must be taken not to overlook inflammatory joint disease, as pain secondary to this will respond to disease modifying therapy. Multidisciplinary treatment modalities are helpful in addressing back pain and apply to such pain in the EB population as well.

Eye pain

Ophthalmologic involvement is pervasive in EB. Eye pain is often caused by corneal abrasions. Comfort measures such as avoiding bright light (a natural reaction to the photophobia that results from the trauma), lubricating eye drops, NSAIDs and antibiotic drops have been used. Evidence for these treatments for recurrent corneal abrasions of other etiologies is modest. The use of eye patches in non-EB patients does not aid pain relief and, therefore, is not recommended for use in EB patients either. There is some evidence that topical NSAIDs provide analgesia for acute, traumatic corneal abrasions (see Box 7).

Good practice points

Corneal abrasions are painful and common in EB; prevention and supportive care are appropriate.

Bacterial keratitis prophylaxis in corneal abrasion — Topical antibiotics should be prescribed for contact lens wearers with corneal abrasion, and a broad-spectrum topical antibiotic is recommended after traumatic abrasion; prophylactic topical antibiotics following abrasion have been shown to prevent ulceration when started within 24 hours of the abrasion (A+, Moderate, Strong). Prophylactic antibiotics can be considered for chronic epithelial defects but routine use is described as controversial given that efficacy has not been established and chronic use may promote resistant organisms. In contact-lens associated abrasion, patching the eye or using a therapeutic contact lens is not advised due to increased risk of secondary bacterial keratitis.

Data

LVPEI has an established electronic record-keeping system (eyeSmart) that tracks patients with unique identifiers through the different tiers, allowing a wealth of data to be extracted retrospectively about treatment regimens and outcomes. For patients with corneal abrasions, retrospective data (861 patients) was supplemented with a small prospective study (134 patients) on patients with corneal abrasions attending VCs and SCs. Retrospective data also included 1821 patients with corneal ulcers (644 from SCs, 1177 from TCs). Institutional approval was sought from LVPEI (Ethics Ref No: Retrospective study: LEC BHR-R-04–21–603, Prospective study: LEC BHR-P-04–21–621). The months for prospective data collection were chosen at the start of the project for convenience. For retrospective data, we wanted to use the most recent data, and data that was not affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and hence we decided to use the 2019 data. Data for retrospective and prospective patients were extracted from electronic medical records using the electronic record-keeping system. Please see Appendix 1 for full details on the recruitment and data collection process. The prospective study had complete follow up and the retrospective study included only cases with full follow up.

Data on patients with corneal abrasion

Prospective data on new patients seen at VCs with the diagnosis of corneal abrasions or injury were collected for two months (May and June 2021) at 18 VCs and two SCs. The centres were selected based on having high volume of corneal patients and being geographically accessible. Patients gave informed consent. Teleconsultations for patients at VCs were performed with cornea specialists and appropriate treatment was provided. In the case of eyes worsening over the follow-up period, the patients were referred to the SCs. The same protocol was used at Secondary centres. Cornea specialists followed up the patients of corneal abrasions at SCs and worsening to corneal ulceration was noted.

Retrospective data for patients with corneal abrasions were captured from 19 SCs between January 2019 and December 2019, spread across four states in India, including the two SCs where the prospective arm of the study was done. All new patients with a first diagnosis of corneal abrasions were included, and the development of corneal ulceration in these patients was captured.

### Impact of first healthcare provider onKeratitis course: how to overcome poor prognosis inKeratitis treatment? A single tertiary center, observational study [^113qjjB5]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK) is one of the most severe ocular infections with poor treatment outcomes. Nearly half of all patients with AK will be severely visually impaired (defined as final visual acuity of 20/80 or less). Several risk factors for Acanthamoeba keratitis have been described, with contact lenses being the most prominent, followed by corneal trauma and abrasion with other foreign bodies. Additionally, there are well-known risk factors for poor final visual outcomes including delayed diagnosis, prior steroid treatment, epithelial defect on presentation and inappropriate primary treatment that does not target Acanthamoeba sp. This supports the promotion of early recognition as a crucial factor for both being able to initiate the correct treatment and also for restoring vision.

Considering the non-specific signs and symptoms that can present in the early stages of the disease, prompt diagnosis remains challenging. There is no single 100% sensitive and specific test for AK, but corneal scraping, microbiological testing, PCR, and in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) are the mainstay of the diagnostic process. Incorrect and late diagnoses often result in visual loss and significant healthcare costs due to the burden of treatment and clinical appointments as well as surgical intervention.

This condition has many masquerades and a delayed diagnosis makes it harder to treat. Delayed diagnosis is an undesirable issue in whole medicine. Several factors for late diagnosis include human error, late referrals, no or limited access to ancillary tests and their expense. Human error is a most prominent issue in rare disorders with non-specific symptoms, like AK. Up to 16–40% of patients with AK require surgical intervention, evisceration included, also due to late or incorrect diagnosis. However, contrary to many other specialties within medicine, ocular health is managed by both doctors (Ophthalmologists and General Practitioners) and other Allied Healthcare Professionals: optometrists, orthoptists, or opticians. Thus, potentially patients suffering from keratitis might be primarily assessed by a non-ophthalmologist, who may not necessarily have AK as one of their diagnostic differentials. The question raised is whether this model of ophthalmic care impacts the management of patients with AK.

Therefore, our aim was to evaluate whether the success of treatment, defined by the visual outcome, was dependent on the type of healthcare provider to first assess the patient (GP, opticians, optometrists and ophthalmologists-residents and consultants).

### Early treatment of corneal abrasions and ulcers-estimating clinical and economic outcomes [^114xTAbQ]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2022). High credibility.

Results

Data on patients with corneal abrasions

Prospective data included 134 patients with corneal abrasions (88 from VCs, 46 from SCs) while retrospective data comprised of 861 patients with corneal abrasions managed in SCs. Figure 3 shows the comparison of prospective and retrospective data for patients with corneal abrasions, and more detailed results are presented in the Appendix 1.

Figure 3
Outcomes of patients presenting with corneal abrasions presented as prospective and retrospective data, and early vs late presenters.

Early presenters in both prospective and retrospective study had lesser number of patients developing corneal ulcer compared to delayed presentation in both prospective and retrospective study. (SC – Secondary Centre, TC Tertiary Centre, CI: Confidence Interval).

Results of the prospective data analysis suggested that of the total 134 patients who had corneal abrasions, five of those patients receiving treatment at VCs/SCs developed ulceration 3.7% (5/134; CI 1.222, 8.493). However, only 2.2% (2/91; CI 0.267, 7.715) of early presenters (who presented within two days of getting injured) developed ulcers but 7% (3/43; CI, 1.463, 19.061) of late presenters (who presented after two days of injury) developed ulcers. The P value was statistically significant (P value < 0.001).

Results of the retrospective data analysis substantiated these findings. Corneal ulcers developed in 27/861 patients (3.7%), with corneal ulcers developing in 2.2% (9/409; CI 1.011, 4.136) of those who presented early within two days and in 4.2% (19/452; CI, 2.549. 6.487) of the late presenters who presented after two days. The P value was statistically significant (P value < 0.001).

### Early treatment of corneal abrasions and ulcers-estimating clinical and economic outcomes [^1122mgrz]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2022). High credibility.

Data on patients with corneal ulceration

Retrospective data for patients with corneal ulcers were captured from 19 SCs as mentioned above and a TC between January 2019 and December 2019. The outcomes included healing of the ulcers with medical management only (either the ulcer healed or was in the healing stage at the last follow up), healing of the ulcer after tissue adhesive and bandage contact lens (TABCL) application, those patients who needed therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty (TPK) and those patients whose eyes were eviscerated.

Key variables

Two key aspects were studied: time of the presentation with abrasion and size of the ulcer. Data on patients with corneal abrasions was analysed to assess the impact of time of presentation on the clinical outcomes. Early presentation was defined as presenting within two days of abrasion while late presentation was defined as those presenting later than two days after abrasion. This analysis was performed separately on retrospective and prospective data to allow comparison of findings.

Data on patients with corneal ulcers was analysed to assess the impact of size of ulcer on the clinical outcomes. Size of corneal ulcers was measured as the product of the length at the widest dimension and at the perpendicular dimension. Small ulcers were defined as being less than 16 mm² while large ulcers were defined as being greater than 16 mm². This analysis was performed separately for SCs and TC, as it was suggested by clinical experts that TCs typically receive more complex cases than SCs.

Statistical analysis

We assessed the incidence of corneal ulcers among patients with corneal abrasion, and we also estimated the incidence separately among those presented within two days and later than two days. The incidence parameters were estimated as proportion of corneal abrasion patients who developed ulcers and proportion of corneal ulcer patients experiencing different outcomes. A Chi square test was used to analyse association between categorical data – proportions of abrasions that healed when presented early versus late (after two days). We also assessed the proportions that healed with medical management and surgical procedures in relation to the size of the ulcer and location of the patients. Univariate and multivariate analysis of risk factors was done for healing versus surgical management of corneal ulcers. Data was collected in a spreadsheet (MS Excel 2013) and statistical analysis was done using the Stata Software version 14.1 (StataCorp, Texas). A P value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

### Evidence-based emergency medicine. update: do ophthalmic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs reduce the pain associated with simple corneal abrasion without delaying healing? [^116zYjxq]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Introduction

Some studies have suggested that ophthalmic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) decrease the pain associated with corneal abrasions without impairing healing. This evidence-based emergency medicine (EBEM) critical appraisal reviews the literature, including additional studies appearing since the publication of an earlier EBEM review in 1999.

Methods

The updated search for randomized controlled trials from 1999 to 2002 complemented the previous 1966 to 1999 search. The methodologic quality of the studies was assessed. Qualitative methods were used to summarize the study results.

Results

The search identified 3 studies not included in the previously published review of ophthalmic NSAIDs, yielding a total of 5 blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trials involving NSAIDs for corneal abrasions. The methodologic quality of the new studies was somewhat higher than that of the 2 original studies and was rated as "good" to "strong". The qualitative summary indicates that NSAIDs provide greater pain relief and improvement of other subjective symptoms when compared with placebo. However, whether the reduction of pain, as measured by visual analog pain scales, exceeds the minimal clinically significant difference is equivocal. The use of ophthalmic NSAIDs may decrease the need for sedating analgesics.

Conclusion

Ophthalmic NSAIDs appear to be useful for decreasing pain in patients with corneal abrasions who can afford the medication and who must return to work immediately, particularly where potential opioid-induced sedation is intolerable.

### The evaluation and management of corneal penetrating and perforating injuries during long-duration spaceflight [^114beHjy]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Risk factors

Corneal penetrating and perforating injuries can result from traumatic impact or conditions that cause corneal melting (e.g. microbial keratitis). Severe or poorly managed corneal abrasions, ulcers, and thermal burns are subject to infections that can progress to corneal perforations. In the setting of microgravity, airborne particulates remain suspended (rather than falling to the floor on Earth) and can enter crewmembers' eyes. With NASA's aim to return to the Moon and to travel to Mars, celestial debris will be an additional risk to ocular health. Lunar and Martian windstorms increase the likelihood of higher-velocity particles causing severe penetrating corneal injuries. Recent literature has described 70 corneal abrasions, 6 chemical burns and 5 ocular infections in a review of NASA Space Shuttle and ISS missions. These were superficial corneal injuries that were successfully treated with topical antibiotics. In contrast, future longer-duration crewed missions to Mars and beyond might require more innovative and novel technology-driven platforms to address the risks for corneal perforation. We review the literature and propose potential countermeasures to prepare for such contingencies for future long term space exploration.

### Topical ophthalmic anesthetics for corneal abrasions: findings from a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis [^1163zNrw]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Corneal abrasions from trauma or epithelial defects created during ophthalmic surgery occur commonly. In this review of nine RCTs in which a total of 556 participants with corneal abrasions are analyzed, we compare the safety and efficacy of topical ophthalmic anesthetic with or without NSAID versus placebo or NSAID. The evidence is of very low certainty for any difference between topical anesthetic and placebo in pain control, healing, or outcomes suggestive of anesthetic abuse. The main reasons for this level of certainty are small sample sizes and an overall high risk of bias. Use of anesthetic eye drops without close monitoring or attention to the amount dispensed (in one trial, 40 mL was prescribed for outpatient use)creates a potential for serious ocular complications. Such sequelae may not be observed in trials with short follow-up or with high participant drop-out, characteristics of several trials in this review.

Given the number of abrasions evaluated in emergency departments (EDs) each year, investigators should plan for larger sample sizes and a longer duration of follow-up, perhaps having a follow-up ophthalmic examination to confirm lack of recurrent erosion or contact lens-related keratitis. These two conditions also present with disruption of the corneal epithelium but require ophthalmic care. Because most abrasions heal within a few days with just a topical antibiotic, high participant attrition in any such trial is anticipated, yet the dangers of anesthetic use increase with lack of monitoring, longer duration of use, higher concentration, or more frequent dosing than prescribed. For a self-limited condition, the risk of blindness from corneal melt, infection, or perforation — all findings of topical anesthetic abuse — must be weighed against any possible benefit.

### Interventions for recurrent corneal erosions [^115pp2st]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Recurrent corneal erosion is a common cause of disabling ocular symptoms and predisposes the cornea to infection. It may follow corneal trauma. Measures to prevent the development of recurrent corneal erosion following corneal trauma have not been firmly established. Once recurrent corneal erosion develops simple medical therapy (standard treatment) may lead to resolution of the episode. However some patients continue to suffer when such therapy fails and once resolved further episodes of recurrent erosion may occur. A number of treatment and prophylactic options are then available but there is no agreement as to the best option.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of prophylactic and treatment regimens for recurrent corneal erosion.

Search Strategy

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and LILACS in June 2007. The NRR was searched in April 2005. We also contacted researchers in the field.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised trials that compared a prophylactic or treatment regimen with another prophylaxis/ treatment or no prophylaxis/ treatment for patients with recurrent corneal erosion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. We contacted study authors for additional information.

Main Results

Five randomised and one quasi-randomised controlled trial were included in the review. The trials were heterogenous and of poor quality. Safety data presented were incomplete. For the treatment of recurrent corneal erosion there was limited evidence that oral tetracycline 250 mg twice daily for 12 weeks or topical prednisolone 0.5% four times daily for one week or both in addition to standard treatment; and excimer laser ablation in addition to mechanical debridement may be effective. Therapeutic contact lens wear was inferior to lubricant drops and ointment in abolishing the symptoms of recurrent corneal erosion and had a high complication rate. For prophylaxis of further episodes of recurrent corneal erosion there was no difference in the occurrence of objective signs of recurrent erosion between hypertonic saline ointment versus tetracycline ointment or lubricating ointment. Lubricating ointment at night in addition to standard treatment following traumatic corneal abrasion (erosion) caused by fingernail injury to prevent recurrence led to increased symptoms of recurrent corneal erosion compared to standard therapy alone.

Authors' Conclusions

Well-designed masked randomised controlled trials using standardised methods are needed to establish the benefits of new and existing prophylactic and treatment regimes for recurrent corneal erosion.

### Topical ophthalmic anesthetics for corneal abrasions: findings from a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis [^112PbETQ]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

A few years ago, the American Academy of Ophthalmology invited the American College of Emergency Physicians to issue joint guidelines regarding use of topical anesthetics for corneal abrasions because of concerns of potential harm. A joint working group from both organizations convened and reviewed the peer-reviewed literature. Unfortunately, the ophthalmologists and emergency room physicians could not find consensus on clinical recommendations, and the final report had no ophthalmologists as authors. The emergency physician guidelines endorse dispensing 1.5–2 mL topical anesthetics (q30 minutes for 24 h) for corneal abrasions in the emergency department setting. This amount (60–80 drops) actually would last 30–40 h, although the guidelines state patients would be asked to discard drops after 24 h. Guideline authors question the emphasis our Cochrane Systematic Review places on RCTs although clinicians, methodologists, and biostatisticians identify, appraise, and synthesize the empirical evidence in a methodologically rigorous process. Therefore, our review is not written "written solely" by ophthalmologists. The authors also claim an "existing practice pattern of ophthalmologists prescribing topical anesthetics for photorefractive keratectomy postoperative analgesia". In truth, topical anesthetic use is exceedingly rare after PRK. At least three papers the emergency physician authors cite to support post-PRK anesthetic use actually describe complications or increased postoperative pain.

### Topical ophthalmic anesthetics for corneal abrasions: findings from a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis [^113AMHRk]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Only four trials in the current review report specific adverse events; most do not report events beyond 1 week. This short follow-up may lead to an inaccurately low estimate of adverse event rates. Topical anesthetic abuse is usually described in the literature at time points well beyond those of the trials in this review. In Turkey, where topical anesthetics were sold over the counter until 2012, one study found that median duration of use was 28 days (range, 10–112 days; 7 patients) before amniotic membrane transplantation was needed for corneal melt. In a case series of patients with toxic keratopathy from topical anesthetic abuse, epithelial healing took a median of 17 days (range, 6–50 days; 19 patients).

The time from trauma to participant randomization is longer than for surgical participants by 24–36 h. Post-trauma trials vary in whether patients with rust rings are included, which has implications for potential risk of bias and applicability of findings. In one post-trauma abrasion trial, abrasion size was not assessed; two trials excluded participants with large abrasions, referring them to ophthalmology. With enough participants, trial investigators could consider stratifying traumatic abrasions by size or only enrolling abrasions of a prespecified size range. Abrasion size in post-trauma trials varies, whereas the epithelial defect is more uniformly created in surgical procedures. Therefore, the baseline risk for slow epithelial healing and adverse events such as infection may differ systematically by setting. Because of different baseline risks, combining post-trauma and post-surgical subgroups when examining for complications does not make clinical sense and therefore is not done.

In conclusion, there is insufficient evidence that topical anesthetics are more safe or effective than placebo for pain or healing of corneal abrasions of either surgical or traumatic origin. Trials with larger sample sizes, means to minimize attrition of trial participants, efficacy outcomes that reflect a better understanding and measurement of pain, and differentiation of abrasions (e.g. uncomplicated abrasions vs. ones with retained foreign material [or rust rings]) would reduce bias and increase certainty of evidence. Future trials and systematic reviews should include core outcome sets, comprised of multistakeholder consensus of measurable, reported standardized outcomes to improve consistency across studies and facilitate comparison of interventions –. Given that most abrasions are self-limited, trial participants should receive appropriate quantities of topical anesthetic to reduce the risk of complication and vision loss. Lessons learned from the opioid epidemic can apply to analgesia for corneal abrasion.

### Corneal injury after routine gastrointestinal endoscopy with moderate sedation [^113cSqzu]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Corneal abrasion has been reported as the most common ocular complication of non-ocular surgery under general anesthesia and deep sedation. Symptoms of corneal injury include ocular burning, scratchy sensation, redness, and pain. Pain associated with the cornea can be intense, as it contains a high density of sensory nerve endings. Diagnosis is made by ophthalmological examination and treatment includes pain management, antimicrobial prophylaxis, pressure patch and close monitoring. Perioperative corneal abrasions under general anesthesia may be attributed to direct chemical or mechanical trauma to the cornea, or to exposure and drying due to lagophthalmos (incomplete eyelid closure). Additional risk factors include lateral or prone positioning, advanced patient age, longer procedure times (especially those > 1 h), supplemental oxygen en route to or in the post-anesthesia care unit, and trauma due to direct contact with the cornea. A single case of this complication associated with endoscopy was reported 24 years ago, in a 75-year-old male undergoing advanced endoscopy (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram) in the prone position under moderate sedation. In recovery the patient complained of blurred vision and ophthalmological consultation diagnosed a left corneal abrasion. We now report a case series of 4 patients who developed corneal injuries while undergoing standard upper and lower gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy under moderate sedation.

Methods

Eligibility criteria for studies and outcomes of interest

We examined only randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Eligible trials compare topical ophthalmic anesthetics (amide or ester class) with a control group (placebo, non-treatment, or alternative treatment). Trials in which topical anesthetics with an NSAID were compared with a control group were eligible. We considered trials that enrolled participants of all ages with corneal abrasions within 48 h of presentation from accidental trauma or ophthalmic surgery.

The primary review outcomes were (1) mean reduction in self-reported pain on a visual analog scale (VAS), where smaller numbers represent less pain, at 24, 48, and 72 h after treatment initiation; (2) the proportion of participants without complete resolution of epithelial defects by 24–72 h; and (3) the proportion of participants with adverse events (e.g. microbial keratitis or stromal infiltration, corneal stromal thinning, corneal perforation, surgical interventions) reported at the longest follow-up time of the study. For secondary outcomes, we considered treatment failure (the proportion of participants who required rescue oral analgesics by 72 h after treatment initiation) and quality of life assessed by a validated instrument at the longest follow-up time of the study. Trials were not excluded on the basis of outcome reporting.

Search methods for identifying studies

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE Ovid, Embase.com, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) to identify potentially eligible RCTs for this review. We did not impose restrictions on the search date or language of publication. The last date of search was February 10, 2023.

Study selection

Pairs of review authors worked independently to review titles and abstracts as well as full-text records against the eligibility criteria; disagreements were resolved by discussion.

### Topical ophthalmic anesthetics for corneal abrasions: findings from a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis [^114yiuCv]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite potential benefit, outpatient use of topical ophthalmic anesthetics can result in poor healing, infection, scar, and blindness. An unbiased analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is needed to examine their effectiveness and safety compared with placebo or other treatments for corneal abrasions.

Methods

Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase.com, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched on February 10, 2023, without restriction on language or publication date. The published review protocol served as registration.

Results

Systematic review and meta-analysis of nine RCTs describing 314 participants with post-traumatic abrasions and 242 participants with post-surgical abrasions, with a median study length of 7 days (interquartile range, 7–14), show no evidence of a difference in pain control between anesthetics and placebo at 24 h in post-trauma cases. Self-reported pain at 24 h is reduced with anesthetics plus topical nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drug in post-surgical participants (mean difference [MD], −5.72 on a 10-point scale; 95% CI, −7.35 to −4.09; 1 RCT; 30 participants) and at 48 h with anesthetics alone in post-trauma participants (MD, −5.68; 95% CI, −6.38 to −4.98; 1 RCT; 111 participants). Anesthetics are associated with 37% increased risk of non-healing defects (risk ratio, 1.37; 95% CI, 0.78 to 2.42; 3 RCTs; 221 post-trauma participants). All evidence is of very low certainty. Over 50% of trials have an overall high risk of bias.

Conclusions

Available evidence is insufficient to support outpatient use of topical anesthetics for corneal abrasions with respect to pain, re-epithelialization, and complication risk.

### What is causing the corneal ulcer? Management strategies for unresponsive corneal ulceration [^114QmMoF]. Eye (2012). Low credibility.

Infectious keratitis represents a significant cause of ocular morbidity in the United States. The work-up and treatment of presumed infectious keratitis (PIK) has changed in the past two decades. The development of newer topical antibiotics has enabled broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage with good tissue penetration. The majority of PIK cases respond well to this strategy. The small numbers of cases that do not respond to the treatment are the cases that offer a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. This review will describe different algorithms that can be followed for the successful management of patients with difficult or progressive PIK. These algorithms are based on scientific work and on our empirical clinical experience. The review will also present three different clinical cases of PIK that were managed according to the algorithms presented in this review.

### Topical ophthalmic anesthetics for corneal abrasions: findings from a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis [^1128Sczb]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Corneal abrasions, loss of the corneal epithelium, can occur from trauma, ocular surgery, dryness, and exposure. They account for 13% of eye-related emergency department visits in the US, with an annual incidence of 3 per 1000 persons and a higher male prevalence –. Traumatic abrasions present with symptoms like pain, photophobia, redness, and tearing. As the cornea is one of the most highly innervated tissues in the body, corneal nociceptors, especially mechanoreceptors, contribute to intense eye pain until healing occurs. Although most small to medium-sized corneal abrasions heal within a few days, complications like corneal erosions and infection may require medical or surgical intervention. In contrast, post-surgical corneal epithelial defects benefit from a sterile field and controlled wound construction.

In medicine, topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and anesthetic drugs are used for localized analgesia with limited systemic effects. However, numerous case reports describe ophthalmic complications from use of high concentrations of topical anesthetics, at excessive frequency, or for prolonged periods of time, including corneal infiltrate, stromal keratolysis ("melt"), endothelial injury, and perforation – – all of which can lead to vision loss. Recent emergency department studies have deemed outpatient use of prescribed topical anesthetics as safe and effective for corneal abrasions –. This assessment contrasts with the experience of ophthalmologists –, leading to renewed questions about outpatient anesthetic use. The lack of consensus guidelines may account for variations in practice within and across specialties –.

The main objective of this summary of our Cochrane systematic review is to report the comparative effectiveness and safety of topical ophthalmic anesthetics compared with placebo or other treatments for corneal abrasions of any etiology, based on the best available evidence. The published review protocol served as registration (Available at: 10.1002/14651858.CD015091).

In nine eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) describing 556 participants with corneal abrasions from traumatic or surgical origin, we find insufficient evidence to support outpatient use of topical ophthalmic anesthetics compared with placebo for reducing pain, improving re-epithelialization, or reducing complication risk in corneal abrasions.

### Clinical practice guidelines for sustained neuromuscular blockade in the adult critically ill patient [^1135nEX3]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Ocular surface complications during neuromuscular blockade — pathophysiology and pediatric RCT data: Because NMBAs impair ocular protective mechanisms (incomplete eyelid closure and absence of corneal reflex), the exposed cornea is at risk of developing ulcerations, infections, and scarring; ocular surface disorders occur in 20–60% of patients who are heavily sedated or receiving NMBAs. In a randomized controlled trial in three PICUs, 7% of subjects (17 of 237) had a corneal abrasion prior to receiving NMBAs, and an additional 10% (n = 21) developed a corneal abrasion within 2 days; one eye received ophthalmic ointment every 6 hours with the eyelid secured closed with tape if needed.

### Corneal injury after routine gastrointestinal endoscopy with moderate sedation [^112mcPgE]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

We report a case series of 4 patients who underwent routine gastrointestinal endoscopy under moderate sedation and developed corneal injuries. Although corneal abrasion has been reported as the most common ocular complication during non-ocular surgery under general anesthesia, the risk for corneal abrasion during routine endoscopic procedures using moderate sedation has not been previously reported. Symptoms reported included ocular burning, scratchy sensation, redness, and pain reported post-procedure. Endoscopists and staff should be alert to the occurrence of this potentially serious complication, as this is paramount for its prevention, diagnosis, and management. Treatment of corneal abrasion includes referral to ophthalmology for close monitoring, pain management, pressure patch, and antimicrobial prophylaxis.
