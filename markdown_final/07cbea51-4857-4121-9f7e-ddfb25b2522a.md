## Question

For a 74-year-old woman who completed 18 months of Tymlos and now has a new DXA showing osteopenia with a lowest T-score of -2.4 at the femoral neck, and FRAX estimates of 18% for major osteoporotic fracture and 4.6% for hip fracture, would alendronate or ibandronate be the better current treatment? Which has the strongest evidence for preventing fractures at the femoral neck, spine, and wrist?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antiresorptive — alendronate or ibandronate — is the better current treatment after 18 months of abaloparatide for a 74-year-old woman with a femoral neck T-score of −2.4 and FRAX 18% major/4.6% hip, and which option has the strongest evidence for preventing fractures at the femoral neck, spine, and wrist. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether immediate antiresorptive therapy is required after stopping an anabolic agent. Then, I should verify fracture efficacy by skeletal site for alendronate versus ibandronate using high-quality RCTs and regulatory labels. Next, I should review guideline hierarchies and site-specific recommendations. After that, I will apply these findings to the patient's specific risks at the femoral neck, spine, and wrist. Finally, I'll recommend a concrete regimen, monitoring plan, and safety considerations, while double-checking for any exceptions or alternative pathways that could change the choice here.

> Let me first confirm the therapeutic imperative after an anabolic course. Discontinuation of anabolics without subsequent antiresorptive coverage can lead to loss of gains, so I need to check whether follow-on antiresorptive therapy consolidates and maintains BMD and fracture benefits. In ACTIVExtend, patients who completed abaloparatide were switched to open-label alendronate 70 mg weekly, which maintained and further translated gains into reduced fractures compared with placebo-to-alendronate, supporting the principle of prompt antiresorptive consolidation after anabolic therapy [^11725Jgo]. Hold on, I should also verify whether other anabolic sequences use alendronate similarly; in ARCH, romosozumab was followed by alendronate for consolidation, and the FDA label for romosozumab reflects fracture risk reduction across endpoints with subsequent alendronate, reinforcing the sequencing model that uses alendronate as the consolidating agent [^1118XQgG] [^115ZKstH].

> Next, I will examine alendronate's fracture efficacy by site, because the patient explicitly needs hip, spine, and wrist protection. In the FIT program and subsequent analyses, alendronate reduced hip fractures by about 53% (RR 0.47), vertebral fractures by approximately 45%, and wrist fractures by about 31%, with benefits consistent across older age strata, which directly addresses the femoral neck and wrist priorities in this case [^113edm3R]. Wait, let me verify consistency across evidence layers; the FDA Binosto/Fosamax labeling summarizes robust vertebral risk reductions across large FIT cohorts, and updated Cochrane reviews corroborate vertebral and nonvertebral benefits, supporting skeletal-wide antifracture efficacy for alendronate in typical osteoporosis populations [^111GVbH3] [^1117ccbw] [^113sLeJg].

> I will now examine ibandronate's profile and limitations. The FDA labeling for oral ibandronate demonstrates significant vertebral fracture reduction but explicitly states no reduction in nonvertebral fractures, including hip and wrist, versus placebo, which is a critical limitation for this patient's goals [^115FWCcx] [^115Yy4Gg] [^113tpCk6]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially wondered whether the once-monthly 150 mg regimen improves nonvertebral outcomes; however, MOBILE confirms BMD gains without demonstrating nonvertebral or hip fracture risk reduction, so I should not infer fracture efficacy at those sites from densitometric improvements alone, especially in the face of FDA-negative nonvertebral outcomes on the daily oral regimen [^114XoLbx] [^115FWCcx] [^115Yy4Gg].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without checking guideline hierarchies. The AACE/ACE 2020 guideline recommends alendronate, risedronate, or zoledronic acid as initial pharmacotherapy for most high-risk patients to reduce hip, nonvertebral, and spine fractures, while noting ibandronate has spine-specific efficacy and may be considered only for selected patients where spine-only protection is acceptable, which is not the case here [^114wUxoj] [^111wqC79]. I should confirm alignment with other major guidelines; ACP and Endocrine Society similarly prioritize bisphosphonates with broad antifracture efficacy as first-line, reinforcing alendronate's suitability over ibandronate when hip and nonvertebral protection are required [^11725Jgo].

> Applying this to the patient's risk profile, I need to ensure we target the femoral neck and wrist in addition to the spine. With a femoral neck T-score of −2.4 (borderline osteoporosis) and FRAX hip probability of 4.6%, hip fracture prevention is paramount at age 74, and wrist fracture prevention is also clinically meaningful in this demographic; alendronate has demonstrated reductions at hip and wrist, whereas ibandronate has not, making ibandronate an inadequate match for the patient's risk distribution and stated goals [^113edm3R] [^113WfNAn]. Let me reconsider whether FRAX calibration changes this conclusion; even if there is some FRAX underestimation in certain cohorts, guideline thresholds and the patient's age still favor an agent with proven hip and nonvertebral efficacy, which again points toward alendronate rather than ibandronate [^113WfNAn] [^115Fc9G6].

> I should double-check that alendronate is the evidence-based consolidator after abaloparatide specifically, not just after other anabolics. ACTIVExtend operationalized alendronate as the follow-on therapy for all entrants from ACTIVE, demonstrating fracture risk reduction and maintenance of BMD gains over the combined period, which provides direct, trial-based support for choosing alendronate immediately after abaloparatide in this clinical scenario [^116GUSne]. For completeness, the romosozumab-to-alendronate sequence in ARCH offers convergent support for this consolidation strategy after an anabolic phase, strengthening external validity for selecting alendronate as the post-anabolic antiresorptive here [^1118XQgG] [^115ZKstH].

> Based on this, my recommended therapy is alendronate, but let me verify dosing and administration. The standard treatment dose is 70 mg orally once weekly with strict empty-stomach administration and upright posture to mitigate esophageal irritation, and weekly regimens are established as therapeutically equivalent to daily administration paradigms with improved convenience, which supports adherence in older adults [^112grdfc] [^114vmkcz]. I need to ensure safety caveats are considered; if the patient has significant esophageal disease, severe GERD, or cannot comply with oral dosing instructions, an IV bisphosphonate such as zoledronic acid would be a better alternative to preserve hip and nonvertebral protection rather than choosing ibandronate, which lacks hip and wrist efficacy in oral form and has no proven hip or broad nonvertebral benefit even when administered orally on extended intervals [^113WfNAn] [^115FWCcx].

> Next, I should review monitoring and duration. For most patients, continuing oral alendronate for 3 to 5 years with reassessment of fracture risk is appropriate; drug holidays can be considered in lower-risk, stable patients after this interval while high-risk patients may continue longer, consistent with ACOG and general practice guidance, and benefits are often retained after discontinuation due to skeletal binding of bisphosphonates [^111PiSAs] [^113WfNAn] [^114T8vf9]. Wait, let me verify early monitoring pitfalls; routine DXA monitoring in the first 3 years after starting a potent bisphosphonate is generally unnecessary and may mislead due to measurement variability, so I would focus on adherence, adverse effects, and clinical events early on, and re-image at about 2 to 3 years or sooner only if there is a compelling clinical reason, recognizing that time-to-benefit for nonvertebral fracture reduction typically accrues within the first 1 to 2 years [^111kaYxj] [^115o8Ate].

> I should confirm supportive measures because antiresorptive therapy depends on adequate substrate. Ensuring daily calcium intake of roughly 1000–1200 mg and vitamin D 800–1000 IU is standard, and these supplements were co-administered in pivotal trials and labels; I also need to check for secondary causes of osteoporosis and falls risk, and to counsel on administration to minimize GI adverse effects, which together optimize the net antifracture benefit of alendronate in practice [^111GVbH3] [^113WfNAn].

> But wait, what if adherence to weekly oral therapy is doubtful or GI intolerance emerges despite precautions? In that scenario, I would avoid defaulting to oral ibandronate because it will not address hip and wrist risk; instead, I would pivot to an agent with proven hip and nonvertebral efficacy such as zoledronic acid or denosumab, guided by the same risk-based guideline framework and patient-specific comorbidities, while keeping a clear plan for consolidation if denosumab is ever discontinued to prevent rebound bone loss [^114wUxoj] [^11725Jgo].

> In summary, after checking the sequence evidence, site-specific efficacy, and guideline hierarchies, alendronate is the appropriate follow-on therapy after abaloparatide for this 74-year-old, because it provides proven reductions in hip, spine, and wrist fractures and is the trial-validated consolidator after anabolic therapy, whereas ibandronate is vertebral-specific and insufficient for this patient's femoral neck and wrist risks; I will implement alendronate 70 mg weekly with supplementation and adherence safeguards, reassess risk at 3 to 5 years, and avoid routine early DXA monitoring unless clinically indicated [^113edm3R] [^116GUSne] [^111wqC79] [^111kaYxj].

Alendronate is the preferred choice for this 74-year-old woman with femoral neck osteopenia and elevated FRAX because it has **proven hip, vertebral, and wrist fracture reduction** [^113edm3R] [^111GVbH3] [^113sLeJg] in large randomized trials, whereas ibandronate only reduces vertebral fractures and does not reduce hip or wrist fractures [^115Yy4Gg] [^115FWCcx] [^113tpCk6]. Alendronate is first-line in guidelines for high-risk patients, and ibandronate is reserved for spine-specific needs [^114wUxoj] [^111wqC79]. Given her femoral neck T-score and FRAX risk, alendronate is the **evidence-based option to reduce overall fracture risk** [^113WfNAn] [^116GUSne].

## Comparative efficacy of alendronate and ibandronate

### Alendronate

- **Vertebral fractures**: Reduces risk by ~45% (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.45–0.67) [^1175NWyT] [^1117ccbw].
- **Nonvertebral fractures**: Reduces risk by ~16% (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74–0.96) [^1175NWyT] [^113sLeJg].
- **Hip fractures**: Reduces risk by ~53% (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81) [^113edm3R] [^111GVbH3].
- **Wrist fractures**: Reduces risk by ~31% (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.50–0.98) [^113edm3R].

---

### Ibandronate

- **Vertebral fractures**: Reduces risk by ~50% (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.34–0.74) [^113tpCk6] [^115NigNj].
- **Nonvertebral fractures**: No significant reduction (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.73–1.11) [^113tpCk6] [^115Yy4Gg].
- **Hip fractures**: No significant reduction (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.60–1.38) [^113tpCk6] [^115FWCcx].
- **Wrist fractures**: No significant reduction (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.60–1.38) [^113tpCk6] [^115Yy4Gg].

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines prioritize bisphosphonates with **broad antifracture efficacy** [^113WfNAn] [^113SUafC]. The **AACE/ACE 2020 guidelines** recommend alendronate, risedronate, or zoledronate as initial therapy to reduce hip, nonvertebral, and spine fractures in high-risk patients [^114wUxoj], whereas **Ibandronate** is reserved for patients needing spine-specific efficacy [^111wqC79].

---

## Patient-specific considerations

- **Femoral neck T-score**: -2.4 (osteopenia).
- **FRAX major osteoporotic fracture risk**: 18%.
- **FRAX hip fracture risk**: 4.6%.

Given her elevated hip fracture risk and femoral neck osteopenia, a bisphosphonate with **proven hip and nonvertebral fracture reduction** is indicated [^114ivmQr].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Alendronate is the preferred therapy because it has **proven efficacy** [^1117ccbw] [^113edm3R] in reducing hip, vertebral, and wrist fractures, whereas ibandronate is limited to vertebral fracture reduction and lacks hip or wrist benefit [^115Yy4Gg] [^115FWCcx]. This aligns with guidelines and the patient's risk profile, making alendronate the evidence-based choice [^114wUxoj] [^113WfNAn].

### Ibandronate sodium [^115FWCcx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The effect on nonvertebral fractures was measured in a study where ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg (ibandronate) taken daily did not reduce the incidence of nonvertebral fractures, which was a secondary efficacy measure. At the 3-year mark, women treated with the daily oral tablet showed a similar number of nonvertebral osteoporotic fractures [9.1%, (95% CI: 7.1%, 11.1%)] compared to those receiving a placebo [8.2%, (95% CI: 6.3%, 10.2%)]. The occurrence of fractures at individual non-vertebral sites, including the pelvis, femur, wrist, forearm, rib, and hip, was similar between the two groups.

- **Effect on BMD**: Ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg taken daily significantly increased bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine and hip compared to a placebo. In a 3-year osteoporosis treatment study, those who received the daily dosage showed progressive and statistically significant increases in lumbar spine BMD at 6 months and all subsequent time points. After 3 years, lumbar spine BMD increased by 6.4% in the treatment group compared to a 1.4% increase in the placebo group (p < 0.0001). Table 4 illustrates significant increases in BMD observed at the lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck, and trochanter relative to placebo.

- **Bone histology**: The effects of ibandronate sodium on bone histology were assessed through iliac crest biopsies after 22 months of treatment in 16 women, and the analysis continued with 20 women after an unspecified period.

### Binosto [^111GVbH3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The **Fracture Intervention Trial: Four-Year Study** involved patients with low bone mass but without a baseline radiographic vertebral fracture. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study included 4,432 patients (alendronate, n = 2,214; placebo, n = 2,218) and further investigated the reduction in fracture incidence due to alendronate sodium. The study aimed to recruit women with osteoporosis, defined as a baseline femoral neck BMD at least two standard deviations below the mean for young adult women. However, following revisions to the normative values for femoral neck BMD, 31% of patients did not meet this entry criterion, resulting in the study including both osteoporotic and non-osteoporotic women. The results are shown in Table 5 for patients with osteoporosis.

- **Fracture results across studies**: In the Three-Year Study of FIT, alendronate sodium reduced the percentage of women experiencing at least one new radiographic vertebral fracture from 15.0% to 7.9% (47% relative risk reduction, p < 0.001); in the Four-Year Study of FIT, the percentage decreased from 3.8% to 2.1% (44% relative risk reduction, p = 0.001); and in the combined U.S./Multinational studies, from 6.2% to 3.2% (48% relative risk reduction, p = 0.034).

Alendronate sodium reduced the percentage of women experiencing multiple (two or more) new vertebral fractures from 4.2% to 0.6% (87% relative risk reduction, p < 0.001) in the combined U.S./Multinational studies and from 4.9% to 0.5% (90% relative risk reduction, p < 0.001) in the Three-Year Study of FIT. In the Four-Year Study of FIT, alendronate sodium…

### Effect of alendronate on the age-specific incidence of symptomatic osteoporotic fractures [^113edm3R]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2005). High credibility.

Analyses of data from 3,658 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis enrolled in the Fracture Intervention Trial showed that alendronate is effective in reducing the risk of symptomatic osteoporotic fractures across a spectrum of ages.

Most osteoporosis studies examine the relative risk of fracture based on the entire duration of treatment. Because older patients tend to be at higher risk for osteoporosis-related fractures, this analysis examined the effect of alendronate treatment on the relative risk of fracture in terms of the age that patients attained during the study.

We studied 3,658 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, aged 55–80 years at baseline, enrolled in the Fracture Intervention Trial, a large randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients were treated with placebo or with alendronate at a daily dose of 5 mg for 2 years, followed by 10 mg for an additional 1–2.5 years, and monitored for clinical fractures. Age, rather than study time, was the dynamic variable in our analysis.

The relative risk reductions for hip, clinical spine, and wrist fractures were constant across age groups, without evidence of a decline at older ages. Specifically, alendronate reduced the risk of clinical fracture by 53% at the hip (relative risk [RR] = 0.47; 95% CI = 0.27–0.81; p < 0.01), 45% at the spine (RR = 0.55; 95% CI = 0.37–0.83; p < 0.01), and 31% at the wrist (RR = 0.69; 95% CI = 0.50–0.98; p = 0.038). In addition, alendronate produced a significant risk reduction of 40% (RR = 0.60; 95% CI = 0.47–0.77; p < 0.05).

### Alendronate for the primary and secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women [^113sLeJg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is an abnormal reduction in bone mass and bone deterioration leading to increased fracture risk. Alendronate belongs to the bisphosphonate class of drugs, which act to inhibit bone resorption by interfering with the activity of osteoclasts.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy of alendronate in the primary and secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women.

- **Search strategy**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE for relevant randomized controlled trials published between 1966 to 2007.

- **Selection criteria**: Women receiving at least one year of alendronate for postmenopausal osteoporosis were compared to those receiving placebo and/or concomitant calcium/vitamin D. The outcome was fracture incidence.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We undertook study selection and data abstraction in duplicate. We performed meta-analysis of fracture outcomes using relative risks, and a greater than 15% relative change was considered clinically important. We assessed study quality through reporting of allocation concealment, blinding, and withdrawals.

- **Main results**: Eleven trials representing 12,068 women were included in the review. Relative (RRR) and absolute (ARR) risk reductions for the 10 mg dose were as follows: For vertebral fractures, a significant 45% RRR was found (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.67). This was significant for both primary prevention, with a 45% RRR (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.80) and a 2% ARR, and secondary prevention with a 45% RRR (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.69) and a 6% ARR. For non-vertebral fractures, a significant 16% RRR was found (RR 0.84).

Regarding medical management for postmenopausal osteoporosis, specifically with respect to antiresorptive and anabolic therapy, the AACE/ACE 2020 guidelines recommend initiating alendronate, risedronate, or zoledronate as initial therapy to reduce hip, non-vertebral, and spine fractures in most patients with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture.

### Therapeutic equivalence of alendronate 35 milligrams once weekly and 5 milligrams daily in the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis [^114vmkcz]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of alendronate 35 mg once weekly compared with alendronate 5 mg daily in the prevention of osteoporosis, we conducted a 1-year, double-blind, multicenter study with postmenopausal women. Participants, aged 40–70 years, had lumbar spine and femoral neck bone mineral density T-scores between -2.5 and 1.

- **Methods**: We compared the efficacy and safety of treatment with alendronate 35 mg once weekly (n = 362) and alendronate 5 mg daily (n = 361). The primary efficacy endpoint was the comparability of lumbar spine bone mineral density increases, defined by strict prespecified criteria.

- **Results**: Mean increases in lumbar spine bone mineral density at 12 months were equivalent. The difference between the alendronate 35-mg once-weekly group and the alendronate 5-mg daily group at month 12 was -0.3% (-0.6, 0.1), well within the prespecified bounds of ± 1.0%. Bone mineral density increases at other skeletal sites and effects on bone turnover were also virtually identical for the two dosing regimens. Both treatment regimens were well tolerated, and the larger weekly unit dose was not associated with an increased frequency of upper gastrointestinal events.

Alendronate 35 mg once weekly is therapeutically equivalent to alendronate 5 mg daily. It provides patients with greater dosing convenience, in addition to the proven efficacy of alendronate and good tolerability.

### Alendronate for fracture prevention in postmenopause [^116Cnbh6]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is an abnormal reduction in bone mass and deterioration, leading to an increased risk of fractures. Alendronate (Fosamax) is part of the bisphosphonate class of drugs, which inhibit bone resorption by interfering with osteoclast activity.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of alendronate in the primary and secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women.

- **Search strategy**: The authors searched Central, Medline, and EMBASE for relevant randomized controlled trials published from 1966 to 2007.

- **Data collection and analysis**: The authors undertook study selection and data abstraction in duplicate. They performed a meta-analysis of fracture outcomes using relative risks, considering a relative change greater than 15 percent clinically important. Study quality was assessed through reporting of allocation concealment, blinding, and withdrawals.

- **Main results**: Eleven trials representing 12,068 women were included in the review. Relative and absolute risk reductions for the 10-mg dose were as follows. For vertebral fractures, a 45 percent relative risk reduction was found (relative risk [RR] = 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.45 to 0.67). This was significant for primary prevention, with a 45 percent relative risk reduction (RR = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.80) and a 2 percent absolute risk reduction; and for secondary prevention, with a 45 percent relative risk reduction (RR = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.69) and a 6 percent absolute risk reduction. For nonvertebral fractures, a 16 percent relative risk reduction was observed.

### T-score as an indicator of fracture risk during treatment with romosozumab or alendronate in the ARCH trial [^1118XQgG]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2020). High credibility.

In the Active-Controlled Fracture Study in Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis at High Risk (ARCH) clinical trial (NCT01631214), one year of romosozumab followed by alendronate reduced the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures compared to alendronate alone in women with prevalent fracture. We performed post hoc analyses of data from patients in ARCH (romosozumab, n = 1739; alendronate, n = 1726) who had a baseline BMD measurement and received at least one open-label alendronate dose. We evaluated 1-year mean BMD and corresponding T-score changes: proportions of patients achieving T-scores > -2.5 at the total hip (TH), femoral neck (FN), and lumbar spine (LS); and group differences in fracture rates after 12 months, while all participants were on alendronate. Subsequently, we investigated the relationship between T-scores achieved at the TH, FN, and LS at 12 months and subsequent fracture incidence.

At one year, the mean change from baseline in TH BMD was 6.3% (T-score change 0.31) with romosozumab versus 2.9% (T-score change 0.15) with alendronate. The proportion of patients with TH T-scores > -2.5 increased from 34% at baseline to 55% after one year of romosozumab and from 32% at baseline to 44% after one year of alendronate. Compared with patients receiving alendronate in year one, those receiving romosozumab had a 75% reduction in new or worsening vertebral fracture (p < .001) in year two, a 19% reduction in nonvertebral fracture (p = .120), and a 40% reduction in hip fracture (p = .041) during the open-label period. TH and FN T-scores achieved at month 12 were associated with subsequent fracture incidence.

### Efficacy and tolerability of once-monthly oral ibandronate in postmenopausal osteoporosis: 2 year results from the MOBILE study [^114XoLbx]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Reducing bisphosphonate dosing frequency may improve suboptimal adherence to treatment and therefore therapeutic outcomes in postmenopausal osteoporosis. Once-monthly oral ibandronate has been developed to overcome this problem.

- **Objective**: To confirm the 1-year results and provide more extensive safety and tolerability information for once-monthly dosing by a 2-year analysis.

- **Methods**: MOBILE, a randomized, phase III, non-inferiority study, compared the efficacy and safety of once-monthly ibandronate with daily ibandronate, which has previously been shown to reduce vertebral fracture risk in comparison with placebo.

- **Results**: 1,609 postmenopausal women were randomized. Substantial increases in lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) were seen in all treatment arms: 5.0%, 5.3%, 5.6%, and 6.6% in the daily and once-monthly groups (50 + 50 mg, 100 mg, and 150 mg), respectively. It was confirmed that all once-monthly regimens were at least as effective as daily treatment, and in addition, 150 mg was found to be better (p < 0.001). Substantial increases in proximal femur (total hip, femoral neck, trochanter) BMD were seen; 150 mg produced the most pronounced effect (p < 0.05 versus daily treatment). Independent of the regimen, most participants (70.5–93.5%) achieved increases above baseline in lumbar spine or total hip BMD, or both. Pronounced decreases in the biochemical marker of bone resorption, sCTX, were observed in all arms after 3 months and maintained throughout. The 150 mg regimen consistently produced greater increases in BMD and sCTX suppression than the 100 mg regimen.

### Meta-analyses of therapies for postmenopausal osteoporosis. II. Meta-analysis of alendronate for the treatment of postmenopausal women [^1175NWyT]. Endocrine Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

The objective was to review the effect of alendronate on bone density and fractures in postmenopausal women.

- **Data source**: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Contents, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry from 1980 to 1999, examining citations of relevant articles and proceedings of international meetings.

- **Study selection**: We included 11 trials that randomized women to alendronate or placebo and measured bone density for at least 1 year.

- **Data extraction**: For each trial, three independent reviewers assessed the methodological quality and abstracted data.

- **Data synthesis**: The pooled relative risk (RR) for vertebral fractures in patients given 5 mg or more of alendronate was 0.52 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.43–0.65]. The RR of nonvertebral fractures in patients given 10 mg or more of alendronate was 0.51 (95% CI 0.38–0.69), indicating an appreciably greater effect than the 5 mg dose. We found a similar reduction in RR across nonvertebral fracture types. In particular, RR reductions for fractures traditionally thought to be "osteoporotic", such as hip and forearm, were very similar to RR reductions for "nonosteoporotic" fractures. Individual studies showed similar results, reflected in the P values of the test of heterogeneity (P = 0.99 for vertebral and 0.88 for nonvertebral fractures). Alendronate produced positive effects on the percentage change in bone density, which increased with both dose and time. After 3 years of treatment with 10 mg of alendronate or more, the pooled estimate of the difference in percentage change between alendronate and placebo was 7.48% (95% CI).

### Treatment of low bone density or osteoporosis to prevent fractures in men and women: A clinical practice guideline update from the American College of Physicians [^114ivmQr]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

This guideline updates the 2008 American College of Physicians (ACP) recommendations on treatment of low bone density and osteoporosis to prevent fractures in both men and women. It is endorsed by the American Academy of Family Physicians.

- **Methods**: The ACP Clinical Guidelines Committee based these recommendations on a systematic review of randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, large observational studies (for adverse events), and case reports (for rare events) that were published between 2 January 2005 and 3 June 2011. The review was updated to July 2016 using a machine-learning method, and a limited update to October 2016 was completed. Clinical outcomes evaluated were fractures and adverse events. This guideline focuses on the comparative benefits and risks of short- and long-term pharmacologic treatments for low bone density, including pharmaceutical prescriptions, calcium, vitamin D, and estrogen. Evidence was graded according to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system.

- **Target audience and patient population**: The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians. The target patient population includes men and women with low bone density and osteoporosis.

- **Recommendation 1**: ACP recommends that clinicians offer pharmacologic treatment with alendronate, risedronate, zoledronic acid, or denosumab to reduce the risk for hip and vertebral fractures in women who have known osteoporosis. (Grade: strong recommendation; high-quality evidence).

### Guideline no. 422g: Menopause and osteoporosis [^114T8vf9]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for postmenopausal osteoporosis, specifically in relation to antiresorptive and anabolic therapy:

- **Bisphosphonates**: According to the SOGC 2022 guidelines, it is recommended to consider initiating bisphosphonates, ideally for up to 5 years, in patients with osteoporosis at intermediate risk of fracture, unless contraindicated.

- **Fracture risk re-evaluation**: It is advised to re-evaluate fracture risk after 3–5 years of treatment and consider prescribing a drug holiday.

### Randomized trial of effect of alendronate continuation versus discontinuation in women with low BMD: Results from the Fracture Intervention Trial long-term extension [^116LuYtv]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2004). Low credibility.

To determine the effects of continuation versus discontinuation of alendronate on bone mineral density (BMD) and markers of bone turnover, an extension trial was conducted. In this trial, 1099 older women who had received alendronate in the Fracture Intervention Trial (FIT) were re-randomized to receive either alendronate or a placebo. Compared to women who discontinued alendronate, those who continued its use for 3 years maintained a higher BMD and experienced a greater reduction in bone turnover, indicating the benefits of ongoing treatment. However, among women who discontinued alendronate and took a placebo in the extension, BMD remained higher, and the reduction in bone turnover was greater than the values at the FIT baseline, showing the persistence of alendronate's effects on bone.

Prior trials, including the FIT, have demonstrated that therapy with alendronate increases BMD and decreases fracture risk for up to 4 years in postmenopausal women with low BMD. However, it is uncertain whether further therapy with alendronate results in preservation or further gains in BMD and whether the skeletal effects of alendronate continue after treatment is stopped.

- **Materials and methods**: A follow-up placebo-controlled extension trial to FIT called FIT long-term extension (FLEX) was conducted, involving 1099 women aged 60–86 years who had been assigned to alendronate in FIT with an average duration of use of 5 years. These women were re-randomized for an additional 5 years to receive either alendronate or a placebo. This document reports the results of a preplanned interim analysis at 3 years. Participants were re-randomized to receive alendronate 10 mg/day (30%), alendronate 5 mg/day (30%), or placebo (40%).

### Alendronate with calcium and vitamin D supplementation is safe and effective for the treatment of decreased bone mineral density in HIV [^115qva34]. AIDS (2007). High credibility.

Decreased bone mineral density (BMD) is prevalent in HIV-infected patients. Bisphosphonates are currently the mainstay of treatment for postmenopausal and male osteoporosis in HIV-uninfected individuals; however, their efficacy and safety in HIV-infected patients remain unclear.

- **Methods**: In this prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter trial, we studied the effectiveness of calcium and vitamin D supplementation with or without alendronate in improving BMD in HIV-infected subjects receiving stable antiretroviral therapy. Subjects with secondary causes of osteoporosis were excluded. The study was powered to detect differences of 3.5% between arms and to detect a moderate sex effect in percentage change in lumbar spine BMD. All dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans were analyzed centrally, blinded by arm.

- **Results**: The 82 subjects enrolled were 71% men and 77% white, with a baseline median age of 48 years, CD4 cell count of 469 cells/μl, and lumbar spine t-score of less than 2.1. Furthermore, 91% had HIV-RNA levels less than 400 copies/ml, and 99% were taking antiretroviral drugs. Compared with calcium/vitamin D alone, alendronate plus calcium/vitamin D resulted in significant improvements in BMD at the lumbar spine, total hip, and trochanter, but not at the femoral neck, compared with baseline. There were trends towards significant increases in BMD values in the calcium/vitamin D group at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck. There were no apparent sex differences in the responses to therapy. Alendronate was well tolerated, without significant adverse effects.

### Time to benefit of bisphosphonate therapy for the prevention of fractures among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis: A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^115o8Ate]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

The clinical decision to initiate bisphosphonate therapy for the treatment of osteoporosis requires balancing shorter-term harms and burdens, such as gastroesophageal irritation or severe musculoskeletal pain, with longer-term benefits in reducing potential fractures.

- **Objective**: To assess the time to benefit (TTB) of bisphosphonate therapy for the prevention of nonvertebral and other fractures among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.

- **Data sources**: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were identified from systematic reviews commissioned by the US Preventive Services Task Force (1 review), the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (1 review), the Cochrane Library (2 reviews), and the Endocrine Society (1 review).

- **Study selection**: Studies selected were RCTs involving postmenopausal women with a diagnosis of osteoporosis based on existing vertebral fractures or bone mineral density T scores of -2.5 or lower. The selection process focused on studies of alendronate, risedronate, and zoledronic acid because they are guideline-recommended first-line agents for reducing nonvertebral fractures. Studies were excluded if they did not focus on women with a primary diagnosis of osteoporosis, had no placebo arm, or had a lack of data on time to fracture.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Random-effects Weibull survival curves were fitted, and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods were used to estimate the absolute risk reduction (ARR) and TTB for each study. These estimates were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis model.

### Treatment of osteoporosis: All the questions we still cannot answer [^111ELoiJ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Many questions remain with regard to the treatment of osteoporosis. The increase in bone mineral density due to bisphosphonates accounts for only a quarter of their antifracture action. The studies of bone mineral density equivalences that have validated certain modes of administration are therefore not relevant. No comparative study on the same patient cohort has been carried out, and the inclusion criteria of the pilot studies on the drugs currently available are all different. This makes any comparison impossible, and thus, the choice of treatment is subjective.

Certain combinations of antiresorptive drugs and anabolic agents are logical, but no major study is available to validate them. Drugs with a long latency period could interfere with later treatments or allow therapeutic windows, but the data in the literature supporting these hypotheses are scarce. The osteoporotic patient will require treatment for 10 to 30 years, depending on the age at diagnosis. However, the available data on the efficacy and nontoxicity of the drugs are based on studies of only 3 or 5 years.

### Ibandronate sodium [^115Yy4Gg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Effect on vertebral fracture incidence**: Ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg as ibandronic acid daily did not reduce the incidence of nonvertebral fractures, which was a secondary efficacy measure. There was a similar number of nonvertebral osteoporotic fractures at three years reported in women treated with ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg as ibandronic acid daily [9.1% (95% CI: 7.1%, 11.1%)] compared to placebo [8.2% (95% CI: 6.3%, 10.2%)]. The two treatment groups were also similar regarding the number of fractures reported at individual nonvertebral sites, including the pelvis, femur, wrist, forearm, rib, and hip [p = 0.0003 vs. placebo].

- **Bone mineral density (BMD)**: Ibandronate sodium significantly increased BMD at the lumbar spine and hip relative to treatment with placebo. In the three-year osteoporosis treatment study, ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg as ibandronic acid daily produced increases in lumbar spine BMD that were progressive over three years and were statistically significant relative to placebo at six months and all subsequent time points. Lumbar spine BMD increased by 6.4% after three years of treatment with 2.5 mg daily ibandronate sodium as ibandronic acid compared with 1.4% in the placebo group. Table 4 demonstrates the significant increases in BMD seen at the lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck, and trochanter.

### Ibandronate sodium [^111b7RU8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

The action of ibandronate on bone tissue is based on its affinity for hydroxyapatite, which is part of the mineral matrix of bone. Ibandronate inhibits osteoclast activity, reducing bone resorption and turnover. In postmenopausal women, it reduces the elevated rate of bone turnover, leading to, on average, a net gain in bone mass.

- **Mechanism of action**: Osteoporosis is characterized by decreased bone mass and increased fracture risk, most commonly at the spine, hip, and wrist. The diagnosis can be confirmed by a finding of low bone mass, evidence of fracture on x-ray, a history of osteoporotic fracture, or height loss or kyphosis indicative of vertebral fracture. While osteoporosis occurs in both men and women, it is most common among women following menopause. In healthy humans, bone formation and resorption are closely linked; old bone is resorbed and replaced by newly formed bone. In postmenopausal osteoporosis, bone resorption exceeds bone formation, leading to bone loss and increased risk of fracture. After menopause, the risk of fractures of the spine and hip increases; approximately 40% of 50-year-old women will experience an osteoporosis-related fracture during their remaining lifetimes.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Ibandronate sodium produced biochemical changes indicative of dose-dependent inhibition of bone resorption, including decreases of biochemical markers of bone collagen degradation (such as deoxypyridinoline, and cross-linked C-telopeptide of Type I collagen) in once-monthly doses from 100 mg to 150 mg in postmenopausal women.

### T-score as an indicator of fracture risk during treatment with romosozumab or alendronate in the ARCH trial [^113iHhXN]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2020). Low credibility.

This post hoc analysis was based on the ARCH (Clinical Trial NCT01631214), a phase 3, multicenter, international, randomized, active-controlled, double-blind study in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Details of the ARCH study have been previously published. Briefly, patients were randomized 1:1 to receive monthly subcutaneous romosozumab 210 mg or weekly oral alendronate 70 mg for 12 months. After completion of the double-blind study period, all patients received open-label weekly oral alendronate 70 mg through the end of the study, blinded to initial treatment assignment. Patients also received daily calcium and vitamin D as previously described.

Primary endpoints for ARCH were the incidence of new vertebral fracture through 24 months and clinical fracture at primary analysis, which was event-driven upon ≥ 330 clinical fractures, with all patients having completed the month 24 visit. Secondary endpoints included the incidence of nonvertebral and hip fractures at primary analysis, results of which have been previously published. This report focuses on results from the post hoc analyses that evaluated mean BMD and corresponding mean T-score changes, as well as the relationships between T-scores after 1 year of romosozumab or alendronate and subsequent fracture incidence.

### Impact of UK national guidelines based on FRAX® — comparison with current clinical practice [^112Mxos2]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

To assess whether clinician-determined treatment intervention thresholds align with the assessment of fracture risk provided by FRAX® and the treatment recommendations by UK guidelines from the National Osteoporosis Guidelines Group (NOGG), a study was conducted.

This retrospective cohort analysis included 288 patients consecutively referred for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanning from primary care immediately prior to the introduction of the FRAX® algorithm. In addition to DXA assessments, patients completed a clinical risk factor questionnaire that included risk factors used in the FRAX® algorithm. Initial risk assessments and treatment decisions were performed after DXA. Retrospectively, FRAX® was used with femoral neck T-scores to estimate fracture risk and applied to NOGG guidelines to generate treatment intervention guidance. Clinician- and NOGG-determined outcomes were audited for concordance.

There was concordance between clinician and NOGG treatment decisions in 215 subjects (74.6%). Discordance was observed in 73 subjects (25.3%). In the discordant group, seven subjects were given lifestyle advice when NOGG recommended treatment. Forty-two were given treatment when NOGG recommended lifestyle advice only, and 24 were referred to a metabolic bone clinic for further evaluation. The reasons for treatment differences in subjects recommended treatment by clinicians but not by NOGG were largely (90.2%) attributed to the use of lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD).

In conclusion, there is a high concordance between clinician-determined treatment interventions and UK national guidelines based on FRAX®.

### Comparative effectiveness of denosumab vs alendronate among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis [^1117j29x]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2024). High credibility.

Patients newly treated with denosumab compared to those treated with alendronate experienced significant reductions in fracture risk over the follow-up period. Specifically, there was a 39% decrease in the risk of major osteoporotic (MOP) fracture (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.48–0.74), a 36% decrease in the risk of hip fracture (RR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.39–0.90), a 43% decrease in the risk of nonvertebral (NV) fracture (RR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.42–0.71), a 50% decrease in the risk of non-hip NV (NHNV) fracture (RR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.35–0.64), and a 30% decrease in the risk of hospitalized vertebral (HV) fracture (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.40–1.01). The magnitude of MOP fracture risk reduction increased over time, with reductions of 9% (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.85–0.97), 12% (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.83–0.93), 18% (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.77–0.87), and 31% (RR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.62–0.76) over 1, 2, 3, and 5 years of follow-up, respectively. Similar patterns of risk reduction over time were observed for hip, NV, and NHNV fractures.

- **Cumulative incidence of fracture outcomes**: The figures illustrate the cumulative incidence of fracture outcomes comparing patients initiating denosumab vs. alendronate:
	- (A) Major osteoporotic (MOP) fracture
	- (B) Hip fracture
	- (C) Nonvertebral (NV) fracture
	- (D) Non-hip NV (NHNV) fracture
	- (E) Hospitalized vertebral (HV) fracture. ✱ p < 0.05 indicates statistical significance. Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; RR, risk ratio.

The results comparing denosumab with oral bisphosphonate (BP) users were consistent with these findings, with alendronate comprising a majority (72%) of the oral BP use. These findings were also consistent across subgroups of patients aged 80 years and older, as well as those with and without a history of fracture over a 5-year follow-up period.

### Ibandronate sodium [^113tpCk6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Ibandronate Sodium Tablets are a bisphosphonate indicated for the treatment and prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

- **Treatment and prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis**: Ibandronate Sodium Tablets are specifically indicated for postmenopausal women to increase bone mineral density (BMD) and reduce the incidence of vertebral fractures.

- **Important limitations of use**: The optimal duration of use has not been determined. The safety and effectiveness of Ibandronate Sodium Tablets for osteoporosis treatment are based on clinical data of three years in duration. All patients on bisphosphonate therapy should have the need for continued therapy re-evaluated periodically. Patients at low risk for fracture should be considered for drug discontinuation after 3 to 5 years of use. Patients who discontinue therapy should have their risk for fracture re-evaluated periodically.

### Alendronate reduces the risk of multiple symptomatic fractures: Results from the fracture intervention trial [^117AoZJ2]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2002). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of alendronate on the occurrence rate of multiple symptomatic fractures. The focus was on the risk of having more than one fracture diagnosed due to the symptoms caused by the fractures over the study period among women with osteoporosis.

- **Design**: A primary analysis of data from a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial.

- **Setting**: Conducted at eleven community-based clinical research centers.

- **Participants**: Participants were a subset of women enrolled in the Fracture Intervention Trial. These women were aged 55 to 81. They either had at least one morphometric vertebral fracture at baseline (n = 2,027) or had no vertebral fracture but met the prevailing World Health Organization bone mineral density criteria for osteoporosis (T-score ≤ 2.5 at the femoral neck) (n = 1,631).

- **Intervention**: All participants reporting a calcium intake of 1,000 mg/day or less received a supplement of 500 mg calcium and 250 IU cholecalciferol. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or alendronate sodium (5 mg/day for 2 years and 10 mg/day for the remainder of the study). The average total follow-up period was 4.3 years.

- **Measurements**: Symptomatic fractures were diagnosed by personal physicians and confirmed by a review of radiological data by an expert committee blinded to treatment assignments.

- **Results**: During the follow-up period, 86 of 1,817 women receiving placebo experienced multiple symptomatic fractures compared to 51 of 1,841 receiving alendronate. The reduction of risk for multiple symptomatic fractures combined was 42% (relative risk (RR) = 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI]).

This study demonstrates the efficacy of alendronate in reducing the risk of multiple symptomatic fractures among women with osteoporosis.

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: An Endocrine Society guideline update [^113SUafC]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hip fracture, specifically concerning osteoporosis, the ES 2020 guidelines recommend initiating bisphosphonates — such as alendronate, risedronate, zoledronic acid, or ibandronate — as initial therapy. This approach aims to reduce fracture risk in postmenopausal patients with osteoporosis who are at high risk of fractures.

### Prevention of postmenopausal bone loss: Six-year results from the Early Postmenopausal Intervention Cohort Study [^113g7qfB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

We report the effect of continuous treatment with alendronate for six years versus placebo in the Early Postmenopausal Intervention Cohort Study. A total of 1,609 healthy, early postmenopausal women were recruited; we describe results for the 585 women who received continuous placebo or alendronate (2.5 or 5 mg) daily for six years. Bone mineral density (BMD) was evaluated at the lumbar spine, hip, forearm, and total body at baseline and annually thereafter. Bone turnover markers were measured every six months from baseline to year two and annually thereafter. Adverse experiences, including upper gastrointestinal events and fractures, were recorded throughout the study.

Women receiving placebo experienced progressive decreases in BMD at all skeletal sites. Patients receiving alendronate experienced significant gains in spine and hip BMD that were maintained through year six. Significantly greater, dose-related decreases in bone turnover markers in the alendronate groups versus placebo occurred within the first year and were sustained through year six. Women receiving alendronate had adverse experience incidences similar to those receiving placebo. Fractures occurred in 11.5%, 10.3%, and 8.9% of women taking placebo, 2.5 mg alendronate, or 5 mg alendronate daily, respectively. Therapy with alendronate is an effective and promising strategy for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

### Management of postmenopausal osteoporosis: ACOG clinical practice guideline No. 2 [^111PiSAs]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for postmenopausal osteoporosis, particularly in relation to antiresorptive and anabolic therapy, the ACOG 2022 guidelines recommend considering the discontinuation of bisphosphonates to allow a drug holiday for low-to-moderate risk patients who have been stable after five years of treatment with oral bisphosphonates or after three years of therapy with IV zoledronic acid. It is advised to consider continuing treatment for longer durations — up to ten years for oral bisphosphonates or up to six years for IV zoledronic acid — in patients who are at high risk of fracture.

### Comparative effectiveness of denosumab vs alendronate among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis [^111V4GqG]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2024). High credibility.

Based on subject-matter expertise, a total of 118 different patient characteristics were selected a priori that represent potential confounders. These characteristics include demographics, comorbidities, comedications, and healthcare service utilization captured during the baseline period. The history of fractures and prior treatment was assessed using all available data prior to treatment initiation.

In order to examine the potential imbalance of unmeasured confounders, such as BMD, between the treatment groups in a similar patient population, we used a separate database linking Medicare claims to a large national electronic health record data system (PCORnet®) to calculate baseline Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX®) scores, which predict the 10-year probability of hip and MOP fractures (Methods S1), among women with PMO newly initiating (no prior history of) denosumab (n = 1088) and oral BP (n = 1662) from 2019 to 2020.

- **Statistical analyses**: We used multivariate logistic regression with treatment as the outcome to calculate propensity scores, which estimate the conditional probability of receiving either denosumab or alendronate. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models with censoring events as the outcome were used to estimate the conditional probability of being censored between treatment groups. Inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTWs) and inverse probability of censoring weights (IPCW) were used to adjust for confounding at treatment initiation and account for potential bias from informative censoring.

### Fracture risk reduction and safety by osteoporosis treatment compared with placebo or active comparator in postmenopausal women: systematic review, network meta-analysis, and meta-regression analysis of randomised clinical trials [^114r8q1X]. BMJ (2023). High credibility.

We used standardized methods, allowing us to evaluate the certainty of the results. The potential risks of bias identified across several of the included studies, predominantly in the form of selective reporting, lowered the rate of certainty in the effect estimates of the outcomes. Other reporting items might have favored newer studies because older studies would not always have anticipated a future standard. Reporting items that might have favored newer studies were domains related to the description of randomization sequence generation and allocation concealment (selection bias), but not the domains related to incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting (post hoc analyses), and potential active involvement of funding parties. We adhered to best practices and reviewed only the quality of published scientific papers.

The supposedly poor quality of reporting in randomized controlled trials is not unique to drug trials of osteoporosis and is a common problem across medical disciplines. Efforts towards more transparent and stringent reporting are urgently needed.

### Comparative effectiveness of denosumab vs alendronate among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis [^1161HaxS]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2024). Low credibility.

Real-world data can be used to answer questions that are difficult to address through RCTs, though conducting a real-world comparative effectiveness study is challenging, as confounding by indication is a common concern. Women prescribed denosumab are more likely to be older, have more comorbidities, and are at greater risk for fracture compared with those taking oral BP. The few cohort studies examining the comparative effectiveness of denosumab vs alendronate — the most widely used oral BP — have reported inconsistent results, potentially due to insufficient sample size and the inability to account for imbalances in important fracture-related risk factors that were either unavailable or inadequately captured (i.e. unmeasured confounding) between patients receiving both medicines. To address this evidence gap, the objective of our study was to assess the comparative effectiveness of denosumab vs alendronate on the risk of osteoporotic fractures in a large, representative cohort of postmenopausal women in the US.

### Intravenous ibandronate injections given every three months: a new treatment option to prevent bone loss in postmenopausal women [^112yuiNb]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy, safety, and dose response of three doses of ibandronate, administered intermittently by intravenous (IV) injection every three months, in preventing postmenopausal osteoporosis.

A total of 629 postmenopausal women, categorized according to time since menopause and baseline lumbar spine (L1–4) bone mineral density (BMD), were enrolled into a multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. These participants were randomly allocated to receive IV ibandronate at doses of 0.5 mg, 1 mg, or 2 mg, or a placebo, every three months. All women received daily calcium supplementation.

After one year of treatment with intermittent IV ibandronate injections, there was a dose-dependent gain in mean (SD) lumbar spine BMD from baseline. The gains were 2.5% (2.5) for the 2 mg group, 1.8% (2.6) for the 1 mg group, and 1.0% (2.8) for the 0.5 mg group, compared to a BMD loss of 0.4% (2.4) in the placebo group; p = 0.0001 for each ibandronate dose versus placebo. The highest BMD gains were observed in women with osteopenia receiving the 2 mg ibandronate dose.

Similarly, at the hip, all three doses of ibandronate resulted in significantly better BMD gains than the placebo (p < 0.05), with the greatest gains in women with osteopenia receiving the 2 mg dose. Ibandronate also concurrently and dose-dependently suppressed markers of bone turnover compared to the placebo, and the injections were well tolerated.

In conclusion, IV ibandronate injections given every three months may represent an effective alternative to oral bisphosphonates and hormonal therapy in the prevention of bone loss in postmenopausal women.

### Fracture risk reduction and safety by osteoporosis treatment compared with placebo or active comparator in postmenopausal women: Systematic review, network meta-analysis, and meta-regression analysis of randomised clinical trials [^112H3udn]. BMJ (2023).

Advances in research have led to a more accurate assessment of the risk of fractures, and the range of treatment options available to prevent fractures has expanded. Algorithms on the risk of fractures that combine clinical risk factors and bone mineral density are now widely used in clinical practice to target treatment to individuals at high risk of fractures. Although drug treatments targeted at osteoporosis consistently improve bone mineral density, preventing fractures is the most relevant patient outcome. Heterogeneity has been noted for the magnitude of the reduction in the risk of vertebral, non-vertebral, hip, and clinical fractures between treatments. Few active comparator trials have directly compared the effects on fracture endpoints. Greater understanding of the differences in the effects of treatments across clinical trials would influence estimates of the benefits of treatment and should therefore be considered among the evidence base that drives guideline recommendations.

Moreover, most randomised controlled trials included patients with an estimated high baseline risk of fractures, but this varied between treatments and over time. Existing post hoc analyses indicate that the antifracture efficacy of some treatments for osteoporosis differs according to estimates of the baseline risk of fractures of individuals in the study, typically, but not exclusively, calculated with the fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX). Therefore, factors such as history of fractures, age, bone mineral density, and body mass index, among others, might be potential effect modifiers.

### Clinical practice. Postmenopausal osteoporosis [^113WfNAn]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). High credibility.

Fractures and osteoporosis are common, particularly among older women, and hip fractures can be devastating. Treatment is generally recommended in postmenopausal women who have a bone mineral density T score of -2.5 or less, a history of spine or hip fracture, or a Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) score indicating increased fracture risk. Bisphosphonates (generic) and denosumab reduce the risk of hip, nonvertebral, and vertebral fractures; bisphosphonates are commonly used as first-line treatment in women who do not have contraindications. Teriparatide reduces the risk of nonvertebral and vertebral fractures. Osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femur fractures have been reported with treatment but are rare. The benefit-to-risk ratio for osteoporosis treatment is strongly positive for most women with osteoporosis. Because benefits are retained after discontinuation of alendronate or zoledronic acid, drug holidays after 5 years of alendronate therapy or 3 years of zoledronic acid therapy may be considered for patients at lower risk for fracture.

### Comparative fracture risk during osteoporosis drug holidays after long-term risedronate versus alendronate therapy: A propensity score-matched cohort study [^115AwEDm]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

An osteoporosis drug holiday is recommended for most patients after 3 to 5 years of therapy. Risedronate has a shorter half-life than alendronate, and thus the residual length of fracture protection may be shorter.

- **Objective**: To examine the comparative risks of drug holidays after long-term (≥ 3 years) risedronate versus alendronate therapy.

- **Design**: Population-based, matched cohort study.

- **Setting**: Province-wide health care administrative databases providing comprehensive coverage to Ontario residents aged 65 years or older between November 2000 and March 2020.

- **Patients**: Persons aged 66 years or older who had long-term risedronate therapy and a drug holiday were matched 1:1 on propensity score to those who had long-term alendronate therapy and a drug holiday.

- **Measurements**: The primary outcome was hip fracture within 3 years following a 120-day ascertainment period. Secondary analyses included shorter follow-up and sex-specific estimates. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for fracture risk between groups.

- **Results**: A total of 25,077 propensity score-matched pairs were eligible (mean age, 81 years; 81% women). Hip fracture rates were higher among risedronate than alendronate drug holidays (12.4 and 10.6 events, respectively, per 1000 patient-years; HR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.04 to 1.34]; 915 total hip fractures). The association was attenuated when any fracture was included as the outcome (HR, 1.07 [CI, 1.00 to 1.16]) and with shorter drug holidays (1 year: HR, 1.03 [CI, 0.85 to 1.24]; 2 years: HR, 1.14 [CI, 0.96 to 1.32]).

### Ibandronate sodium [^115NigNj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The effectiveness and safety of ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg daily oral tablets were demonstrated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational study involving 2946 women aged 55 to 80 years. These participants were, on average, 21 years postmenopause and had a lumbar spine BMD 2 to 5 standard deviations below the premenopausal mean (T-score) in at least one vertebra [L1 to L4]. They also had one to four prevalent vertebral fractures. Ibandronate sodium was evaluated at oral doses of 2.5 mg daily and 20 mg intermittently. The main outcome measured was the occurrence of new radiographically diagnosed vertebral fractures after 3 years of treatment. The diagnosis of an incident vertebral fracture was based on both qualitative assessment by a radiologist and quantitative morphometric criteria. The morphometric criteria required the dual occurrence of a relative height ratio or relative height reduction in a vertebral body of at least 20%, together with at least a 4 mm absolute decrease in height. All women received 400 international units of vitamin D and 500 mg of calcium supplementation per day.

- **Effect on vertebral fracture**: Ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg daily oral tablets significantly reduced the incidence of new vertebral fractures compared to placebo. Over the course of the 3-year study, the risk for new vertebral fractures was 9.6% in the placebo-treated group and 4.7% in the group treated with ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg daily oral tablets (p < 0.001).

### Denosumab or zoledronic acid in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis previously treated with oral bisphosphonates [^116DnTSe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is a chronic, progressive condition that generally requires long-term management. Oral bisphosphonates are a commonly prescribed treatment for osteoporosis, but inconvenient dosing regimens and side effects can lead to low adherence. Suboptimal adherence to osteoporosis medication can reduce antifracture efficacy and increase health care use and costs. Although more extended dosing intervals can improve adherence, efficacy remains an influential determinant of patient preference for and adherence to osteoporosis medications.

Once-yearly intravenous bisphosphonate therapy with zoledronic acid (ZOL) has been shown to reduce the risk of hip, vertebral, and nonvertebral fractures. Although parenteral bisphosphonates, such as ZOL, have become a treatment option for osteoporosis, there is no evidence that cycling through bisphosphonate agents offers therapeutic benefit to patients with osteoporosis, whether assessed by bone mineral density (BMD) or bone turnover markers (BTMs). In one clinical trial, patients expressed a preference for once-yearly ZOL over a weekly bisphosphonate regimen. However, switching from oral bisphosphonates to ZOL did not further increase BMD.

Denosumab (Prolia; Amgen Inc.) is a fully human monoclonal antibody against RANKL, administered subcutaneously every six months. In a three-year, placebo-controlled, pivotal osteoporosis trial, denosumab significantly reduced BTMs, increased BMD, and reduced the risk of hip, vertebral, and nonvertebral fractures. Three studies have shown that individuals who received prior bisphosphonate therapy and transitioned to denosumab have experienced benefits in bone health and fracture risk reduction.

### Osteoporosis treatment prevents hip fracture similarly in both sexes: The FOCUS observational study [^115Fc9G6]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2024). High credibility.

An additional caveat is that our input for the FRAX calculation did not include parental history of fracture. As a result, our reported FRAX scores may underestimate the true absolute ten-year risk of hip fracture. However, any such underestimation should be similar for both sexes and therefore should not compromise our between-sex comparisons.

FRAX was used in this study as an alternate method to identify "high risk" patients; we did not address its accuracy for assessing ten-year risk for either sex in this cohort, which was not relevant to our objectives. Interestingly, when high-risk status for inclusion in the analysis was defined by the FRAX hip score instead of the hip BMD T-score, the odds ratio for treatment was exactly the same for both sexes. This finding suggests that, in selecting patients for treatment, efficacy might be more determined by the level of fracture risk than by BMD status.

The still-large effect size with inclusion by FRAX (the odds ratio was 0.28) also indicates that many patients with osteopenia (low bone mass) at the hip benefited from treatment. For instance, the high-risk FRAX cohort was substantially larger than the high-risk BMD cohort (5,495 vs. 3,205 patients, see Figure 1) and had 42% of patients without BMD-defined hip osteoporosis. Similarly, the high-risk femoral bone strength cohort had 31% of patients without BMD-defined hip osteoporosis.

Finally, in calculating the odds ratios, we did not account for any competing risk of death. In our main analysis, all patients who died or left the Kaiser healthcare system (we could not differentiate) bef.

### On the utilization of polygenic risk scores for therapeutic targeting [^113mfaGY]. PLoS Genetics (2019). Low credibility.

In the United States alone, over 1.5 million postmenopausal women suffer clinically significant bone fractures each year. The lifetime risk of both hip and vertebral fractures is over 15%, with hip fractures seriously impeding the mobility of half of the patients for an extended period, leading to a requirement for long-term ambulatory care in a third of cases. It is not clear whether the 10% elevation in mortality following a fall leading to a hip fracture is a consequence of the fracture itself or comorbid with an underlying disease. Hormone replacement therapy with estrogen and progesterone has consistently been found to reduce fracture rates by around 40%. However, following the Women's Health Initiative's detection of meaningfully elevated rates of invasive breast cancer and cardiovascular morbidity, this therapy is no longer widely adopted. Instead, bisphosphonate inhibitors of bone resorption, such as alendronate, which are similarly effective without the serious adverse effects, have become the standard of care. These treatments also show cost-effectiveness in high-risk groups over the age of 70.

Recently, a monoclonal antibody inhibitor of sclerostin, romosozumab, that simultaneously increases bone formation and decreases bone resorption, was shown in two randomized clinical trials to reduce both vertebral and nonvertebral fracture rates. Direct comparison of this treatment with alendronate alone in high-risk women with bone mineral density (BMD) in the bottom decile and a history of fracture demonstrated remarkable efficacy, consistent with a number needed to treat (NNT) for vertebral fracture of less than 20 (6.2% relative to 11.9%).

### Drug insight: Bisphosphonates for postmenopausal osteoporosis [^114vv5cs]. Nature Clinical Practice Endocrinology & Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Bisphosphonates are potent antiresorptive agents that have been extensively used for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis over the past decade. When embedded in the bone matrix, bisphosphonates are absorbed by osteoclasts involved in bone resorption, leading primarily to osteoclast apoptosis through the inhibition of farnesyl diphosphate synthase, a key enzyme in the mevalonate pathway. This process results in decreased bone resorption and an improvement in the mechanical properties of the bone, thereby reducing fracture risk.

Alendronate and risedronate are oral nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates. Several randomized, placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated their efficacy in halving the risk of vertebral fractures when taken daily for three years. Nonvertebral fracture risk, including that at the hip, was also significantly decreased. Weekly dosing regimens have simplified the administration of bisphosphonates and, likely, improved treatment adherence.

A significant reduction in vertebral fracture risk has also been shown with an intermittent regimen of ibandronate, a new, potent, nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate. Recently marketed for oral use as a once-monthly 150 mg dose, ibandronate aims to improve compliance. Bisphosphonates are generally well tolerated in the long term. The intravenous administration of bisphosphonates in women with osteoporosis is currently under investigation and may offer an interesting future option for those who cannot tolerate oral regimens, potentially enhancing compliance.

### Bone mineral density after transitioning from denosumab to alendronate [^115i5vew]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Limited data are available regarding the optimal post-denosumab bisphosphonate treatment regimen. In a small case series evaluating women followed for up to 2 years after the FRAME trial, zoledronic acid (n = 11) infusion after denosumab discontinuation showed 73% to 87% preservation of the gains in BMD at the TH or LS after 1 year, with minimal further BMD loss at any skeletal site in year 2; participants given risedronate (n = 5) showed only partial preservation of BMD (41%–64%). These findings are somewhat inconsistent with a previous, smaller case series showing only minimal efficacy to preserve BMD after denosumab treatment cessation. This difference in outcome may be related to the inclusion of participants with different ages, previous osteoporosis treatments, and durations of denosumab treatment. It should be noted that intravenous zoledronic acid was administered 6 or 8 months after the last denosumab injection.

In the analysis, which included a larger number of participants, 1 year of alendronate treatment following 1 year of denosumab led to maintained or increased BMD at the TH or LS in 84% to 92% of participants. These findings demonstrate the potential for bisphosphonate treatment to prevent reversible bone loss in patients who discontinue denosumab treatment. They may suggest that oral alendronate helps maintain BMD in the period immediately following denosumab discontinuation when the effects of treatment on bone turnover have dissipated. Ongoing randomized clinical trials evaluating bisphosphonate use after denosumab discontinuation should provide additional insights.

### Comparative effectiveness of denosumab vs alendronate among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis [^113zk8uN]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2024). High credibility.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) affects millions of women worldwide. The prevalence of PMO in women aged ≥ 50 years has been estimated at 15.4% in the US and 22.1% in the EU. Osteoporosis can greatly affect quality of life due to the increased risk of fractures and subsequent effects on mobility, ambulation, and self-care. A recent systematic review, including data from 36 countries, reported a 22.8% median 1-year mortality rate after hip fracture. Osteoporosis represents a significant economic burden due to complications following fractures, with one study reporting an annual facility-related hospital cost of $5.1 billion USD for fracture care in women aged ≥ 55 years in the US, which is a greater annual cost than myocardial infarction, stroke, or breast cancer.

Management of osteoporosis includes non-pharmacological (e.g. diet, exercise, calcium, and vitamin D supplementation) and pharmacological therapies. According to US treatment guidelines, oral bisphosphonates (BP; alendronate, ibandronate, and risedronate), IV BP (ibandronate and zoledronic acid), RANK-L inhibitors (denosumab), and anabolics (abaloparatide, romosozumab, and teriparatide) are all appropriate choices for initial therapy among women with PMO at high risk for fracture.

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have demonstrated that denosumab is more effective in increasing bone mineral density (BMD) compared with oral and IV BP over 12 months of follow-up. However, the head-to-head efficacy of denosumab versus BP on fracture outcomes — the clinical endpoint of greatest interest to healthcare providers — has not been fully established.

### Fracture and bone mineral density response by baseline risk in patients treated with abaloparatide followed by alendronate: Results from the Phase 3 ACTIVExtend trial [^116GUSne]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2019). High credibility.

In the ACTIVE trial, patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either a placebo, abaloparatide 80 μg daily in a blinded manner, or open-label teriparatide 20 μg daily for 18 months. The design and methodology of ACTIVExtend (NCT01657162) have been detailed in previous documentation. ACTIVExtend was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines, as well as all relevant local regulatory and ethical requirements.

A total of 581 and 558 eligible patients who completed ACTIVE entered ACTIVExtend from the placebo and abaloparatide groups, respectively, forming the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. All patients in ACTIVExtend received oral alendronate 70 mg once weekly for up to 24 months. Patients with evaluable spinal radiographs at ACTIVE baseline and at the end of ACTIVExtend (month 43) comprised the modified ITT population (mITT: n = 568 and n = 544 in the placebo/alendronate and abaloparatide/alendronate groups, respectively) for evaluation of new vertebral fractures. The incidence of new vertebral, non-vertebral, clinical, and major osteoporotic fractures, along with bone mineral density (BMD) changes at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck over the entire 43-month period from ACTIVE baseline to the end of ACTIVExtend, were evaluated.

Prespecified subgroup analyses included evaluation of the following nine ACTIVE baseline risk subgroups:

- **Lumbar spine BMD T-score**: ≤ − 2.5 versus > − 2.5 and ≤ −3.0 versus > −3.0
- **Total hip BMD T-score**: ≤ − 2.5 versus > − 2.5 and ≤ −3.0 versus > −3.0
- **Femoral neck BMD T-score**: ≤ − 2.5 versus > − 2.5 and ≤ −3.0

### Alendronate improves bone mineral density in children and adolescents perinatally infected with human immunodeficiency virus with low bone mineral density for age [^114juBHX]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Children and adolescents with perinatal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and low bone mineral density (BMD) may be at higher risk of osteoporosis and fractures in later life than their uninfected peers. Bisphosphonate therapy has been shown to reduce fractures in adults with osteoporosis but has not been formally studied in youths living with HIV.

- **Methods**: Fifty-two children and adolescents (aged 11–24 years) perinatally infected with HIV with low lumbar spine (LS) BMD (Z score < -2.0) were enrolled. Participants received alendronate or placebo for 48 weeks, and changes in LS BMD were measured.

- **Results**: Alendronate was associated with greater increases in LS BMD compared to placebo (treatment difference 13% [95% confidence interval: 8%-18%], P < .001). No cases of jaw osteonecrosis, atrial fibrillation, or nonhealing fractures were reported. Mean increases (95% confidence interval) in LS BMD over 48 weeks were significantly larger on alendronate (20% [14%-25%]) than placebo (7% [5%-9%]). Similar improvements were seen for whole body BMD.

- **Conclusions**: In this small study, children and adolescents perinatally infected with HIV with low LS BMD experienced significant improvements in bone density after 48 weeks of alendronate, which was well-tolerated and showed no safety concerns.

### Effect of abaloparatide vs alendronate on fracture risk reduction in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis [^11672Mk4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: The study population for this research was drawn from the 18-month, phase 3 ACTIVE study (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01343004). It included 2,463 postmenopausal women aged 49 to 86 years with osteoporosis from 28 study centers. Osteoporosis was defined based on prior radiographic vertebral fracture or recent nonvertebral fracture (within the past 5 years prior to enrollment) and a BMD T-score of less than or equal to −2.5 and greater than −5.0 at the lumbar spine or femoral neck in women aged 65 years or younger. Women older than 65 years were eligible if they met the fracture criteria and had a lumbar spine or femoral neck BMD T-score of less than or equal to −2.0 and greater than −5.0 or had no prior fracture but had a lumbar spine or femoral neck BMD T-score of less than or equal to −3.0 and greater than −5.0.

- **Key exclusion criteria**: Included the use of bisphosphonates for more than 3 months in the past 5 years or denosumab within the past year. Additional inclusion and exclusion criteria have been previously described.

- **Extension study eligibility**: Women who were randomly assigned to the abaloparatide or placebo arm in ACTIVE and completed the end-of-treatment visit were eligible for enrollment in the ACTIVExtend extension study (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01657162). Additional criteria for inclusion in the extension have been previously described.

### Comparative effectiveness of denosumab vs alendronate among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis [^114ebcG2]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2024). Low credibility.

Previous non-interventional studies evaluating the potential fracture reduction benefit when comparing denosumab and oral BP have produced conflicting results, which may be due, in part, to residual confounding. A Danish study using national registry data found no meaningful differences in the 3-year risk of hip fracture and any fracture (hazard ratio [HR] ~1.05 and HR ~0.92, respectively), and similar results were observed in a separate Danish study limited to patients with type 2 diabetes. Because denosumab typically is used as second-line treatment in Denmark (following alendronate), patients treated with denosumab are likely to have more advanced disease (i.e. more likely to fracture). There was no adjustment for BMD — an important determinant of fracture risk and prescribing choice — in either of these studies. In contrast, a smaller Swiss study that adjusted for BMD found meaningful reductions in the risk of any fracture (HR, ~0.54; 95% CI, 0.41–0.69), vertebral (HR, ~0.51; 95% CI, 0.39–0.68), and NV (HR, ~0.54; 95% CI, 0.44–0.65), but not hip fractures (HR, ~0.85; 95% CI, 0.43–1.67) with the use of denosumab versus alendronate.

### Efficacy of bisphosphonates in reducing fracture risk in postmenopausal osteoporosis [^111Ru8GU]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Bisphosphonates have been available for more than a decade. Currently, four bisphosphonates — alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate, and zoledronic acid — are approved in the United States. Alendronate and risedronate are oral agents, ibandronate is available in oral and intravenous formulations, and zoledronic acid is an intravenous drug. This review summarizes results from pivotal clinical trials in which these bisphosphonates have been shown to reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures.

Also reviewed are results of "bridging" studies designed to demonstrate the comparable efficacy of less frequent dosing regimens to increase bone mineral density and reduce bone turnover. Compared with placebo controls, all four approved bisphosphonates reduce the relative risk of new vertebral fractures in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. Alendronate, risedronate, and zoledronic acid reduce the relative risk of new nonvertebral and hip fractures. Clinical trial extensions of up to 10 years with alendronate and 7 years with risedronate have shown that efficacy is maintained during long-term treatment.

### Value of routine monitoring of bone mineral density after starting bisphosphonate treatment: secondary analysis of trial data [^111kaYxj]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

Our findings support a recommendation against routine monitoring in the first three years after potent bisphosphonate therapy is started. Other work with data from the Fracture Intervention Trial also supports not monitoring bone density in the first few years of alendronate treatment. Women observed to have no net change in bone mineral density after four years of treatment were found to have a high probability of responding to treatment. Reductions in fracture risk with alendronate treatment were shown for women who were observed to lose bone density during treatment. Failure to recognize this measurement variation may lead clinicians to make inappropriate changes to treatment or to delay taking action when they should intervene.

In summary, bone density increases sufficient to continue therapy unaltered occurred in virtually all osteoporotic women treated with a potent oral bisphosphonate for three years. Monitoring bone mineral density in this early period after starting treatment is unnecessary, and, because of the potential to mislead, it is best avoided.

### Comparative effectiveness of denosumab vs alendronate among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis [^116HAtUg]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2024). High credibility.

The present study should be evaluated while considering the following limitations. First, only clinical vertebral fractures were identified, missing out on the vast majority of vertebral fractures that do not come to clinical attention. Without access to successive patient radiographs, it is not possible to pinpoint the time when a new vertebral fracture occurred. As vertebral fractures are often asymptomatic or present as back pain, significant delays between the fracture episode and an eventual diagnosis can result in misclassification where prevalent fractures occurring prior to treatment initiation are captured as incident events, which is not as relevant for other fracture endpoints. Consequently, we identified vertebral fractures using validated algorithms with inpatient diagnoses only (positive predictive value = 98.4%), identifying clinically severe fracture types and intentionally favoring specificity over sensitivity.

Second, we cannot rule out the possibility of residual confounding due to missing information on BMD, a key confounder. We did, however, calculate FRAX scores and found a higher 10-year probability of fracture in the denosumab cohort prior to treatment initiation. We then used quantitative bias analysis to re-estimate the RR of fracture for denosumab vs. alendronate users and observed results that were consistent with, if not more pronounced than, our primary analysis (suggesting an even greater benefit), indicating that our findings are robust to unmeasured confounding. In a separate study, we utilized negative control outcomes to assess.

### Evenity [^115ZKstH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Study 2 (NCT01631214) was a randomized, double-blind, alendronate-controlled study involving postmenopausal women aged 55 to 90 years (mean age of 74 years). These participants had a BMD T-score less than or equal to −2.5 at the total hip or femoral neck, combined with either one moderate or severe vertebral fracture, or two mild vertebral fractures. Alternatively, they had a BMD T-score less than or equal to -2.0 at the total hip or femoral neck, coupled with two moderate or severe vertebral fractures or a history of a proximal femur fracture. Women were randomized (1:1) to receive either monthly subcutaneous injections of EVENITY (N = 2046) or oral alendronate 70 mg weekly (N = 2047) for 12 months, accompanied by 500 to 1000 mg calcium and 600 to 800 international units vitamin D supplementation daily. After the 12-month treatment period, women in both groups transitioned to open-label alendronate 70 mg weekly while remaining blinded to their initial treatment.

This was an event-driven trial. The two primary efficacy endpoints were the incidence of morphometric vertebral fracture at 24 months and time to the first clinical fracture through the primary analysis period, which ended when at least 330 subjects had a clinical fracture, and all subjects had completed the 24-month visit. Clinical fracture was a composite endpoint of nonvertebral fracture and symptomatic vertebral fracture.

- **Effect on fractures**:
	- EVENITY significantly reduced the incidence of new vertebral fractures at 24 months. This result is detailed in Table 3, which has been omitted here. EVENITY also significantly reduced the risk of clinical fracture through the end of the primary analysis period. This information is expanded on in Table 4, which has also been omitted.

### Alendronate for the primary and secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women [^1117ccbw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

Osteoporosis is an abnormal reduction in bone mass and bone deterioration, leading to increased fracture risk. Alendronate belongs to the bisphosphonate class of drugs, which inhibit bone resorption by interfering with the activity of osteoclasts, the bone cells that break down bone tissue. This document is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2008.

To assess the benefits and harms of alendronate in the primary and secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women, we conducted a review. The focus was on women at lower and higher risk of fractures, respectively.

- **Search methods**: We searched Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews, including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two trial registers, drug approval agency websites, and the bibliographies of relevant systematic reviews to identify the studies included in this review. The latest search date was February 1, 2023. We imposed no restrictions on language, date, form of publication, or reported outcomes.

- **Eligibility criteria**: We included only randomized controlled trials that assessed the effects of alendronate on postmenopausal women. Participants must have received at least one year of alendronate treatment. We classified a study as secondary prevention if its population met one or more of the following hierarchical criteria: a diagnosis of osteoporosis, a history of vertebral fractures, a low bone mineral density T-score (-2.5 or lower), and age 75 years or older. If a study population met none of those criteria, we classified it as a primary prevention study.

- **Outcomes**: Our major outcomes were clinical vertebral and non-vertebral fractures.

### Short-term and long-term effects of osteoporosis therapies [^114CjqSN]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

Progress continues to be made in the development of therapeutics for fracture prevention. Bisphosphonates are now available orally and intravenously, often as inexpensive generics, and remain the most widely used interventions for osteoporosis. The major safety concern associated with the use of bisphosphonates is the development of femoral shaft stress fractures and, although rare, this adverse event provides the principal rationale for restricting bisphosphonate therapy to those individuals with femoral T-scores for over 5 years.

Newer antiresorptive therapies, in the form of denosumab and cathepsin K inhibitors, might increase efficacy and possibly circumvent some of the safety concerns associated with bisphosphonate use, such as gastrointestinal and renal complications. The combination of teriparatide with antiresorptives markedly increases effects on bone mineral density (BMD), and new anabolic agents are also very promising in this regard. However, whether these changes in BMD translate into improved efficacy of fracture prevention remains to be determined.

Vitamin D is important for the prevention of osteomalacia but does not influence BMD or fracture risk in patients not deficient in vitamin D. The balance of risks and benefits of calcium supplementation is contentious, but patients should be encouraged to adhere to a balanced diet aimed at maintaining a healthy body weight. Consideration of a patient's risk of falling, and its mitigation, is also important.

### The importance of previous fracture site on osteoporosis diagnosis and incident fractures in women [^115ehcNf]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2014). Low credibility.

A previous fracture increases the risk of subsequent fractures, regardless of the site of the initial fracture. Fracture risk assessment tools have been developed to guide clinical management; however, they do not discriminate based on the site of the prior fracture. Our objective was to determine which sites of previous nontraumatic fractures are most strongly associated with a diagnosis of osteoporosis, defined by a bone mineral density (BMD) T-score of ≤ -2.5 at the femoral neck, and an incident major osteoporotic fracture.

Using administrative health databases, we conducted a retrospective historical cohort study of 39,991 women aged 45 years and older who had BMD testing with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Logistic regression and Cox proportional multivariate models were used to test the association of previous fracture site with the risk of osteoporosis and incident fractures. Clinical fractures at the following sites were strongly and independently associated with a higher risk of an osteoporotic femoral neck T-score after adjustment for age: hip (odds ratio [OR], 3.58; 95% confidence interval, 3.04–4.21), pelvis (OR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.66–3.0), spine (OR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.77–2.62), and humerus (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.49–2.02).

Cox proportional hazards models, with adjustment for age and femoral neck BMD, showed the greatest increase in risk for a major osteoporotic fracture among women who had sustained previous fractures of the spine (hazard ratio [HR], 2.08; 95% CI, 1.72–2.53), humerus (HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.44–2.01), patella (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.10–2.18), and pelvis.
