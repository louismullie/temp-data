## Question

What are reasons for an elevated alkaline phosphatase in children?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the reasons for an elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in children. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the laboratory result itself and whether the reported ALP truly reflects an elevation for the child's age and sex. Then, I should verify the likely source of ALP using GGT and, if needed, isoenzyme fractionation. Next, I will construct age-specific differentials, separating physiologic from pathologic causes, and map an evidence-based diagnostic algorithm. Finally, I should define when to observe versus when to investigate, including targeted tests and red flags for urgent referral, while keeping special populations and common pitfalls in mind.

> Let me first confirm the result in context of age- and sex-specific reference intervals, because normal ALP values in children are much higher than in adults due to skeletal growth, and many labs still use adult ranges, which can mislead interpretation. I should double-check that the reported value exceeds the upper limit of normal for the child's exact age and sex, ideally using pediatric reference intervals that show ALP peaks in early childhood and puberty, and falls toward adult ranges by mid-adolescence [^114sULVf] [^115XyQyB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology until I identify the source of ALP. Most circulating ALP in children originates from bone, so a GGT can help distinguish hepatobiliary ALP from bony ALP, and if uncertainty remains, I should consider ALP isoenzyme fractionation, noting that bone-specific ALP comprises roughly 80–90% of total ALP in pediatrics, which explains why even physiologic growth spurts can push ALP upward without liver disease [^115eFu7U] [^1157JGuq].

> I will now examine the most common benign cause in toddlers: benign transient hyperphosphatasemia (BTH), typically ages 6 months to 5 years, often following a viral illness, with ALP frequently 5–10 times the upper limit of normal but normal GGT and other liver tests. I should confirm a downward trend on repeat testing in 2–3 months, and avoid unnecessary imaging or extensive workup if the child is asymptomatic and other labs are normal, recognizing prevalence estimates around 1–3% in young children and supportive cohort data showing rapid normalization [^115XLydM] [^113kShy2] [^112kmb9k].

> Wait, let me verify growth-related physiology as another major contributor. Rapid linear growth in infants and adolescents drives osteoblastic activity and can raise ALP within the expected pediatric range, so I need to check the trajectory and whether the value remains age-appropriate, keeping in mind that pubertal surges can be particularly pronounced [^1164DS7j] [^115XyQyB].

> Next, I should review nutritional rickets and other hypophosphatemic disorders. Elevated ALP with low or low-normal calcium, low phosphate, and elevated PTH points toward vitamin D deficiency or calcipenic rickets, whereas hypophosphatemia with renal phosphate wasting and elevated or inappropriately normal FGF23 suggests phosphopenic rickets such as X-linked hypophosphatemia, where ALP remains a reliable marker of rachitic activity. If rickets is suspected, I should obtain 25(OH)D, PTH, calcium, phosphate, and consider wrist or knee radiographs for classic metaphyseal changes, and calculate TmP/GFR when XLH is in the differential [^114XcZbH] [^115TVaf7] [^115PLRtA] [^114L1vgY].

> Let me consider hyperparathyroid states. In primary hyperparathyroidism in older children and adolescents, ALP may be significantly elevated when bone involvement is present, accompanied by hypercalcemia and inappropriately normal or elevated PTH, so I should confirm calcium and PTH together and pursue targeted imaging if biochemical PHPT is confirmed [^1148U6Gs] [^112ey2ng].

> I should double-check bone turnover conditions and malignancy. In infants with intestinal failure on parenteral nutrition, marked ALP elevations often reflect metabolic bone disease rather than cholestasis, so I need to check for bone-specific ALP or correlate with PTH and vitamin D status, while ALP can also rise with fractures, osteomyelitis, or bone tumors, prompting clinical correlation and imaging when indicated [^113wHjg3] [^113Fviv2].

> But wait, what if the ALP is hepatobiliary? I need to ensure that a concurrent GGT elevation and cholestatic pattern guide me toward ultrasound to assess ducts and parenchyma, recognizing that in children cholestatic etiologies include biliary atresia, Alagille syndrome, PFIC, PSC, and drug-induced cholestasis, with the caveat that pediatric ALP is less reliable for biliary injury due to bone turnover, so GGT and imaging are particularly important [^115xNaAK] [^114ssva1].

> I will now examine hepatic infiltrative and vascular causes. Hematologic malignancies such as leukemia or lymphoma can present with ALP elevation, hepatosplenomegaly, fever, and cytopenias, and in acute liver failure contexts, ALP may be normal or low in Wilson disease, where an ALP to total bilirubin ratio less than 4 and an AST to ALT ratio greater than 2.2 can be highly predictive in adults, though pediatric performance is less reliable and clinical context remains paramount [^115BjhFk] [^113NEGxq] [^116Js6R6].

> Let me first confirm the drug and toxin contributions. Medications commonly implicated in pediatric ALP elevation include asparaginase, dasatinib, and recurrent ketamine use with a cholestatic pattern, so I should carefully review exposures and monitor hepatic function during therapy, adjusting or discontinuing agents as indicated by severity and protocol guidance [^112bPw9c] [^1127d2Py] [^113rgeQH].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations. In infants with cholestasis or TPN exposure, fractionated ALP often shows bone ALP predominance, arguing against attributing the rise to liver disease alone, and in critically ill children, ALP may reflect bone turnover rather than cholestasis, so I need to integrate clinical context and consider bone-specific markers when available [^113wHjg3].

> Next, I should review a pragmatic diagnostic algorithm. If the child is asymptomatic with isolated ALP elevation and normal GGT, I should repeat ALP in 2–3 months to document resolution consistent with BTH, whereas if ALP is persistently elevated, I should check calcium, phosphate, 25(OH)D, and PTH to evaluate for rickets, obtain GGT and an abdominal ultrasound if I suspect hepatobiliary disease, and add autoimmune markers, viral hepatitis serologies, and a careful medication review when cholestasis is suspected. Persistence beyond 6 months or values exceeding twice the upper limit of normal with concerning features should prompt hepatology referral and consideration of MRCP or liver biopsy [^114k6r3r] [^114XcZbH] [^112kmb9k] [^113XoUqa].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said "measure FGF23 routinely", but I should correct that. FGF23 is helpful in untreated suspected XLH but is not routinely measured in treated patients, and TmP/GFR and fasting phosphate are more informative for monitoring, so I will prioritize those when XLH is suspected or being managed [^115PLRtA] [^1157JGuq].

> I need to ensure red flags are not missed. Jaundice, coagulopathy, encephalopathy, rapidly rising bilirubin, or ALP greater than five times the upper limit of normal with symptoms warrant urgent evaluation and likely referral to pediatric hepatology, and I should not delay escalation when these are present [^113XoUqa].

> Let me reconsider monitoring cadence. For presumed physiologic or BTH elevations, repeating ALP in 2–3 months is reasonable, whereas for confirmed rickets, checking calcium, phosphate, 25(OH)D, and PTH about 1 month after starting therapy, then again at 3 months, and tracking linear growth and radiographic healing is standard, with longer-term 25(OH)D surveillance annually after stabilization [^112kmb9k] [^112QxpcA].

> Finally, I should confirm that I have communicated the key principle: in children, an elevated ALP most often reflects bone turnover rather than liver disease, so verifying age-appropriate norms, using GGT to source the isoenzyme, and applying an age-specific differential are essential to avoid overtesting and to catch treatable causes early [^115eFu7U] [^113Fviv2].

---

In children, elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) most often reflects **physiologic bone growth** or **benign transient hyperphosphatasemia** [^115XLydM], but persistent or marked elevations warrant evaluation for bone or liver disease [^115xNaAK]. The most common causes are **benign transient hyperphosphatasemia** (ages 6 months–5 years, often post-viral, resolving in months) [^115XLydM] [^113kShy2], **rickets/osteomalacia** (vitamin D deficiency, malabsorption, hypophosphatemia, chronic kidney disease) [^114XcZbH] [^111tFadN], and **hepatobiliary disease** (cholestasis, biliary atresia, hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury) [^113Fviv2] [^116VCtcF]. Less common causes include hyperparathyroidism, leukemia/lymphoma, bone tumors, and medications (anticonvulsants, corticosteroids, chemotherapeutics) [^1148U6Gs] [^115BjhFk] [^112bPw9c]. Initial workup should include age-specific reference ranges, GGT to confirm hepatic origin, calcium/phosphate/25(OH)D/PTH, and liver enzymes; add isoenzyme analysis, imaging, or specialist referral if persistent or > 3× ULN [^115eFu7U] [^115TVaf7] [^115xNaAK].

---

## Physiological causes

Physiological causes include **growth spurts**, where rapid bone turnover during growth raises ALP, especially in early childhood and adolescence [^113LJvTk] [^112XLmib]. Benign transient hyperphosphatasemia occurs in children 6 months to 5 years, often after viral illness, with ALP 3–10× ULN and spontaneous resolution in 2–4 months [^115XLydM] [^113kShy2].

---

## Bone-related pathological causes

- **Rickets and osteomalacia**: Vitamin D deficiency, malabsorption, hypophosphatemia (e.g. XLH), or CKD cause impaired mineralization with elevated ALP [^114XcZbH] [^114L1vgY] [^1144dvME].

- **Hyperparathyroidism**: Primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism increases bone turnover and ALP [^1148U6Gs].

- **Bone tumors and metastases**: Osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and leukemia/lymphoma can elevate ALP [^115BjhFk].

- **Fractures and bone healing**: Recent fractures or orthopedic procedures transiently increase ALP [^113Fviv2].

---

## Hepatobiliary causes

- **Cholestatic liver disease**: Biliary atresia, Alagille syndrome, PFIC, PSC, and extrahepatic obstruction elevate ALP [^115xNaAK] [^113Fviv2].

- **Hepatitis and liver injury**: Viral hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, and autoimmune hepatitis can raise ALP [^113Fviv2] [^111THBwC].

- **Parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease**: Cholestasis in infants on prolonged TPN elevates ALP [^113wHjg3].

---

## Medications and toxins

Medications and toxins include **anticonvulsants** (phenytoin, phenobarbital) that induce hepatic enzymes and may cause cholestasis, and **corticosteroids**, which can impair bone formation and increase bone turnover. Chemotherapeutic agents such as methotrexate, asparaginase, and dasatinib can cause hepatotoxicity or bone effects [^112bPw9c] [^1127d2Py].

---

## Diagnostic approach

1. **Confirm elevation with age-specific reference ranges**: Exclude physiologic elevation [^1164DS7j]
2. **GGT, AST, ALT, bilirubin**: Confirm hepatic origin; assess liver injury pattern [^115eFu7U]
3. **Calcium, phosphate, 25(OH)D, PTH**: Evaluate for rickets/osteomalacia, hyperparathyroidism [^115TVaf7]
4. **ALP isoenzymes**: Differentiate bone vs liver ALP [^113Fviv2]
5. **Liver ultrasound, bone X-rays**: Assess hepatobiliary anatomy, fractures, or bone disease [^116VCtcF]
6. **Specialist referral**: Persistent > 3× ULN or concerning features [^113XoUqa]

---

## Clinical significance and management

Clinical significance and management depend on the cause: **benign transient hyperphosphatasemia** requires reassurance and observation [^112kmb9k], whereas **rickets/osteomalacia** calls for vitamin D/calcium/phosphate therapy and monitoring [^112QxpcA]. Hepatobiliary disease warrants specialist referral and targeted therapy, and medication-induced ALP elevation requires review and adjustment of offending drugs [^113XoUqa].

---

Elevated ALP in children is common and usually benign; persistent or marked elevations need a focused workup to distinguish growth-related changes from bone or liver disease and guide appropriate management.

5.5 Pediatric
Neurotoxicity

Published animal studies demonstrate that the administration of anesthetic and sedation drugs that block NMDA receptors and/or potentiate GABA activity increase neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain and result in long-term cognitive deficits when used for longer than 3 hours. The clinical significance of these findings is not clear. However, based on the available data, the window of vulnerability to these changes is believed to correlate with exposures in the third trimester of gestation through the first several months of life, but may extend out to approximately three years of age in humans [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.4), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)].

Some published studies in children suggest that similar deficits may occur after repeated or prolonged exposures to anesthetic agents early in life and may result in adverse cognitive or behavioral effects. These studies have substantial limitations, and it is not clear if the observed effects are due to the anesthetic/sedation drug administration or other factors such as the surgery or underlying illness.

Anesthetic and sedation drugs are a necessary part of the care of children needing surgery, other procedures, or tests that cannot be delayed, and no specific medications have been shown to be safer than any other. Decisions regarding the timing of any elective procedures requiring anesthesia should take into consideration the benefits of the procedure weighed against the potential risks.

5.6 Drug-Induced Liver Injury

Ketamine administration is associated with hepatobiliary dysfunction (most often a cholestatic pattern), with recurrent use (e.g., misuse/abuse or medically supervised unapproved indications). Biliary duct dilatation and/or biliary duct stricture and/or stenosis with or without evidence of biliary obstruction has also been reported with recurrent use. Obtain baseline LFTs, including alkaline phosphatase and gamma glutamyl transferase, in patients receiving ketamine as part of a treatment plan that utilizes recurrent dosing. Monitor those receiving recurrent ketamine at periodic intervals during treatment.

Reports of ketamine and the occurrence of sclerosing cholangitis have been received. Therefore, consider sclerosing cholangitis in patients with long term ketamine use and a cholestatic pattern of increased LFTs particularly grossly elevated gamma glutamyl transferase and alkaline phosphatase levels.

5.7 Increase in Cerebrospinal Fluid Pressure

An increase in intracranial pressure has been reported following administration of ketamine hydrochloride. Patients with elevated intracranial pressure should be in a monitored setting with frequent neurologic assessments.

CF Foundation screening recommendations — laboratory tests for cystic fibrosis hepatobiliary involvement: The CFF recommends that these tests be performed on an annual basis beginning at CF diagnosis, and we recommend further evaluation if any abnormalities are persistent (> 3–6 mo). Prior guidelines recommended further action at 1.5–2× upper limit of normal values for increased specificity, but it is important to use age and sex-normative values. Common liver test abnormalities in cystic fibrosis may include elevations in serum AST, ALT, GGT, and/or alkaline phosphatase.

Genotype–phenotype correlation

Although XLH seems to be completely penetrant, its severity varies widely, even among family members, with no clear gender difference. A large number of inactivating mutations in PHEX can cause XLH, and a genotype–phenotype correlation is not obvious.

Further patient work-up

Patients should be evaluated for the presence and severity of common and rare complications of XLH depending on their age (Table 1). In young children, dynamic tests or specific investigations, such as hearing evaluation or oral examination, are sometimes not feasible and can be delayed until the child reaches 3–5 years of age.

NASPGHAN pediatric IBD diagnosis — pediatricians "are ideally positioned to initiate the workup" when UC or CD is suspected, and initial laboratory studies "should assess for" inflammatory markers (elevated white blood cell and platelet counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], C-reactive protein [CRP]). Evaluation for gastrointestinal blood loss and anemia uses hemoglobin/hematocrit, and mean cell volume (MCV) distinguishes chronic disease (low MCV) from acute processes (normal MCV). Serum albumin is often low in newly diagnosed or flaring IBD, and liver function tests — alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and g-glutamyltransferase (GGT) — can be elevated.

### Cross-sectional analysis: clinical presentation of children with persistently low ALP levels [^116YfhpH]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Low activity of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is a hallmark of hypophosphatasia (HPP), but low readings of ALP are not always recognized in clinical routine. Understanding the clinical presentations associated with low ALP may contribute to a timelier diagnosis of HPP.

Methods

Data from paediatric patients with low ALP, excluding patients in intensive care and with oncological/haematological disorders, were analysed. Most recent ALP values, previous diagnoses, medication and relevant symptoms were extracted from patient records at nine specialised centres and analysed descriptively. A relationship between body height and ALP values was scrutinised by linear regression.

Results

Of 370 children, 15 (4.1%) had a diagnosis of HPP. In the subgroup without a diagnosis of HPP, 241 (67.9%) out of 355 patients had one or more medical conditions known to be associated with low serum ALP. Of those, hypothyroidism, malnutrition and steroid administration were most frequent. Characteristic symptoms, particularly, short stature, muscle weakness and delay of motor development were more frequent and ALP values were lower in patients with documented HPP diagnosis compared to patients without diagnosis of HPP (Ø z-scores: -2.52) (interquartile range [IQR] = 0.20) vs. -1.96 (IQR = 0.87). A weak positive linear relationship between z-scores of ALP and body height was identified (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

This analysis of paediatric patient records elucidates a wide range of disorders associated with low ALP activity. In case of additional specific symptoms, HPP should always be considered as a differential diagnosis.

### Prevalence of elevated liver enzymes and their association with type 2 diabetes risk factors in children [^1164xsqp]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Given their established role in hepatic function and insulin resistance for adults, early screening of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the pediatric population may potentially be improved by the assessment of elevated liver enzymes.

Methods

Our study enrolled 151 nondiabetic children aged 10–14 years. Patients were assessed for demographics and five risk factors for T2DM. The levels of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels were determined in serum samples. The effects of demographics and risk factors on abnormal liver enzyme levels were assessed with univariate chi-square analyses and also with multivariate logistic regression analyses, which were controlled for gender.

Results

Frequencies for abnormal liver enzyme values were as follows: 13 (9%) for GGT, 5 (3%) for ALT, and 20 (13%) for ALP. Across analyses, two results were consistently statistically significant. Females were more likely to have abnormal ALP levels, and patients with BMI percentile ≥ 95% and with acanthosis nigricans were more likely to have abnormal GGT levels.

Conclusions

Our study suggests GGT as potential marker for T2DM discovery in children. Subsequent long-term longitudinal studies would help to more clearly delineate GGT's association with T2DM. Additionally, future studies that elucidate the molecular contribution of GGT elevation to T2DM pathogenesis are needed.

### Management of acute pancreatitis in the pediatric population: a clinical report from the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition pancreas committee [^114SK7Gz]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Medium credibility.

Pediatric acute pancreatitis — diagnosis and initial evaluation — requires meeting INSPPIRE-based criteria with at least two features, including abdominal pain, enzyme elevation, or imaging findings, and initial imaging should be transabdominal ultrasonography with additional imaging reserved for complicated cases; first-attack testing should include liver enzymes, triglyceride, and calcium levels. Specifically, diagnosis "requires at least 2 of the following: (1) abdominal pain compatible with AP, (2) serum amylase and/or lipase values ≥ 3 times upper limits of normal, (3) imaging findings consistent with AP", and "Initial imaging may be accomplished via transabdominal ultrasonography, with other imaging (CT, MRI) reserved for more complicated cases ± tailored to suspected etiology", while "first attack of AP testing should include liver enzymes (ALT, AST, GGT, ALP, bilirubin), triglyceride level, and calcium level".

### Association of intestinal alkaline phosphatase with necrotizing enterocolitis among premature infants [^113iQJgx]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Unlike candidate biomarkers inclusive for all forms of systemic inflammation, can dysfunction in host management of microbiota have a high positive predictive value as a biomarker for necrotizing enterocolitis?

Findings

In this diagnostic study of 136 premature infants, high amounts of intestinal alkaline phosphatase protein in stool and low intestinal alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity were associated with diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis. There was no association of intestinal alkaline phosphatase measures with non–gastrointestinal tract infections.

Meaning

Measuring the inability of intestinal alkaline phosphatase to maintain host-microbiota homeostasis can potentially guide decisions for personalized care and treatment when an infant is most susceptible to developing necrotizing enterocolitis.

A total of 20 children with benign transient hyperphosphatasemia were prospectively evaluated with no additional investigations recommended except repeat serologic evaluation in 2–3 months. The average age of our patients was 2.5 years (range 1 year 2 months-5 years 10 months). The serum levels of alkaline phosphatase averaged 2383 IU/L (range 1013–5700 IU/L). Levels returned to normal within several months. This condition should be recognized by the clinician in order not to put patients through lengthy, expensive and unnecessary investigations.

### Imaging patterns in pediatric hypophosphatasia [^117VgAWp]. Pediatric Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypophosphatasia is a rare genetic disorder of calcium and phosphate metabolism due to ALPL gene mutations, which leads to abnormal mineralization of the bones and teeth. Hypophosphatasia is characterized by low serum alkaline phosphatase activity and a number of clinical signs, including failure to thrive, bone pain and dental issues. The diagnosis is suspected based on clinical, laboratory and imaging findings and confirmed by genetic testing. Diagnosis in children is often delayed due to a lack of disease awareness, despite specific imaging findings that are a cornerstone of the diagnosis. The recent approval of enzyme replacement therapy (bone-targeted recombinant tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase) has given imaging an important role in monitoring treatment efficacy. The aim of this pictorial essay is to review the imaging features of hypophosphatasia at diagnosis and during follow-up, including whole-body magnetic resonance imaging patterns.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^112QxpcA]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency in children — monitoring therapy includes scheduled labs and imaging. It is important to obtain calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels 1 month after initiating therapy, and with stoss therapy a biochemical response occurs in 1 or 2 weeks with an early increase in phosphate; ALP may actually increase in the short term, there is usually an initial increase in 1,25(OH)2-D, then ALP and 1,25(OH)2-D decrease to normal while 25(OH)-D increases to within the reference range. Complete radiologic healing may take months, but changes are evident in 1 week. In 3 months, it is important to obtain calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, ALP, 25(OH)-D, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, and one may consider obtaining a urine sample to determine the calcium/creatinine ratio. A radiograph should be repeated at 3 months, and subsequently 25(OH)-D levels should be monitored yearly.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113Fviv2]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is produced mainly in the liver (from the biliary epithelium) but is also found in abundance in bone and in smaller quantities in the intestines, kidneys and white blood cells. Levels are physiologically higher in childhood, associated with bone growth, and in pregnancy due to placental production. Pathologically increased levels occur mainly in bone disease (eg, metastatic bone disease and bone fractures) and cholestatic liver disease — for example, primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, common bile duct obstruction, intrahepatic duct obstruction (metastases) and drug-induced cholestasis. Furthermore, hepatic congestion secondary to right-sided heart failure can also lead to cholestasis (elevated ALP levels and/or bilirubin).

When ALP is elevated in isolation, the measurement of γ-glutamyltransferase can indicate whether the ALP is of hepatic or non-hepatic origin. While there are no data on the most likely causes of an isolated raised ALP in an asymptomatic population, the the most common cause is likely to be vitamin D deficiency, or normal increase seen in childhood due to rapid growth. Other causes include Paget's disease and bony metastases. If doubt still exists, the use of electrophoresis to separate the isoenzymes of ALP can differentiate hepatic from non-hepatic causes of increased ALP.

AST and ALT are enzymes present in hepatocytes and are released into the blood stream in response to hepatocyte injury or death (hepatitis). Elevations in either of these enzymes are the the most common abnormality seen on liver blood test profiles. Both enzymes are present in many differing types of tissue, but ALT is considered more liver-specific since it is present in low concentrations in non-hepatic tissue, and non-liver related elevations are uncommon. However, AST is abundantly present in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle and so may be elevated in patients with myocardial infarction or myositis. Although ALT is considered a more specific indicator of liver disease, the concentration of AST may be a more sensitive indicator of liver injury in conditions such as alcohol-related liver disease and in some cases of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). In children, creatine kinase measurement may help to determine whether an isolated rise in ALT or AST is due to an underlying skeletal muscle disorder, such as muscular dystrophy.

NASPGHAN guideline — Additional testing for chronic liver diseases in children with suspected nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) lists the following: screening labs (complete blood count [CBC] with differential, AST, bilirubin [total, conjugated], alkaline phosphatase, GGT, international normalized ratio [INR], albumin, total protein, hemoglobin A1c); exclude infections (eg, hepatitis A IgM, hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, other chronic viral infections); exclude endocrine disorders (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH], free thyroxine [T4]); exclude autoimmune causes of ALT elevation (total IgA, total IgG and tissue transglutaminase antibody, antinuclear antibody, antismooth muscle antibody, anti–liver-kidney microsomal antibody); exclude genetic causes (ceruloplasmin and/or 24-hour urine copper, lysosomal acid lipase, alpha-1 antitrypsin phenotype); imaging (abdominal ultrasound to rule out anatomical abnormalities or assess features of portal hypertension, magnetic resonance imaging, or spectroscopy to measure hepatic fat); liver biopsy (histology, copper measurement, stain for microvesicular fat, assess fibrosis); and red flags for advanced liver disease including chronic fatigue, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, jaundice, splenomegaly, firm liver on examination, enlarged left lobe of the liver, low platelets, low white blood cell count, elevated direct bilirubin, elevated international normalized ratio (INR), and long history of elevated liver enzymes (> 2 years).

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^115eFu7U]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

γ-Glutamyltransferase (GGT) is abundant in the liver and also present in the kidney, intestine, prostate and pancreas but not in bone; therefore it can be useful in confirming that an elevated ALP is of liver and not bony origin.GGT is most commonly elevated as a result of obesity, excess alcohol consumption or may be induced by drugs. Although an elevated GGT has a low specificity for liver disease, it is one of the best predictors of liver mortality. It is particularly useful in children to establish the likelihood of biliary disease when ALP is not a reliable indicator. Predominant causes of cholestasis in children include congenital abnormalities of the biliary tract and genetic disorders affecting bile synthesis and excretion.

A total of 20 children with benign transient hyperphosphatasemia were prospectively evaluated with no additional investigations recommended except repeat serologic evaluation in 2–3 months. The average age of our patients was 2.5 years (range: 1 year 2 months-5 years 10 months). The serum levels of alkaline phosphatase averaged 2383 IU/L (range: 1013–5700 IU/L). Levels returned to normal within several months. This condition should be recognized by the clinician in order not to put patients through lengthy, expensive and unnecessary investigations.

Table 1
Laboratory work up in suspected pediatric NAFLD

Laboratory tests in suspected pediatric NAFLD, and correspondent ruled out diseases of other etiology.

Liver function blood tests and imaging techniques (US, CT, MRI) are commonly used as indirect markers of liver steatosis. None of these have proven to be reliable, and the sensitivity and the specificity are undetermined. Aminotransferases are used, together with the measurement of accessible serum parameters such as glucose, triglyceride, cholesterol, lipoproteins, glucose/insulin levels after tolerance tests, and glycated hemoglobin HbA1c (Table 1), to assess NAFLD diagnosis and to screen children from possible hepatopathy-related metabolic complications, such as MS. These measurements must be combined with the evaluation of anthropometric parameters – BMI, abdominal circumference – and with other information such as the patient's gender and the health state and lifestyle of the relatives. Generally, the AST: ALT ratio is less than 1, but this value can increase as fibrosis progresses. Circulating levels of aminotransferases can fluctuate over time and are normal (< 0.67 μkat/l) in a large number of children with NAFLD and NASH. Normal levels of serum aminotransferases do not exclude the presence of fibrosis or even cirrhosis. Serum levels of alkaline phosphatase and GGT can also be slightly elevated in pediatric NAFLD. Moreover, positive antinuclear antibody and smooth muscle antibody (SMA) titers can be found in 15.4%, and in 10% of patients, respectively. Positive autoantibodies have been associated with the higher fibrosis stages.

### Transient benign hyperphophatasemia [^115XLydM]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Aim

Sometimes, a temporary increase in alkaline phosphatase level is found in healthy infants and toddlers without evidence of liver or bone disease. The condition is customarily termed transient benign hyperphosphatasemia of infancy and early childhood. Most textbooks do not refer to the condition. The aim of the study was to promote broader awareness of transient benign hyperphosphatasemia.

Methods

We completed a systematic review of the literature using the principles underlying the UK Economic and Social Research Council guidance on the conduct of narrative synthesis and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement.

Results

The 142 reports retained for analysis included 813 cases (male:female ratio 1.1:1.0): 80 in subjects older than 18 years and 733 in subjects 18 years or younger. The alkaline phosphatase ratio, calculated by dividing the measured level by the upper limit of normal, was ≥ 5.0 in ≈70% and the duration of the elevation was ≤ 4 months in 80% of the cases. Transient benign hyperphosphatasemia often followed a benign infection, but available data fail to demonstrate a causal link. The prevalence of transient benign hyperphosphatasemia ranged from 1.1% to 3.5% in infants 2 to 24 months of age.

Conclusions

Transient benign hyperphosphatasemia is likely the most common cause of hyperphosphatasemia among healthy infants and toddlers. Sometimes it also occurs in older children and adults, indicating that the traditional term transient benign hyperphosphatasemia of infancy and early childhood may not be correct. The elevation in alkaline phosphatase persists for > 4 months in ≈20% of the cases. Recognition of this benign condition is crucial to avoid unnecessary investigations.

Regarding medical management for X-linked hypophosphatemia, more specifically with respect to burosumab (children, monitoring), XLH-EG 2025 guidelines recommend to consider increasing the burosumab dose, not exceeding the maximum dose, during follow-up if patients demonstrate elevated ALP activity without a clear trend in reduction and/or failure to improve clinical and radiological signs of rickets, although serum phosphate levels are within the lower age-related range.

### Pediatric hypophosphatasia: avoid diagnosis missteps! [^112S7BHk]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is the dento-osseous disorder caused by deactivating mutation(s) of ALPL, the gene that encodes the "tissue-nonspecific" isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP). In HPP, 3 natural substrates of cell-surface TNSALP accumulate extracellularly; phosphoethanolamine (PEA), inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP). Hypophosphatasemia together with elevated plasma levels of PEA, PPi, and PLP comprise its biochemical signature. PPi can inhibit mineralization and in extracellular excess can impair bone and tooth hardening and perhaps explain weak muscle. Autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive inheritance from among more than 400 mutations of ALPL largely accounts for HPP's broad-ranging severity, greatest among all skeletal diseases. Pediatric HPP spans life-threatening perinatal and infantile forms, childhood forms, and odonto-HPP selectively featuring premature loss of deciduous teeth. ALPL gene testing and TNSALP supplementation therapy have bolstered familiarity with HPP, but there are new considerations for diagnosis. Herein, diagnosis of a boy's mild childhood HPP was delayed by missteps involving his medical and dental history, physical examination, radiographic findings, and clinical laboratory studies. We review how pediatric HPP is now identified. Prompt diagnosis while appreciating the broad-ranging severity of HPP underlies the safe and effective management of this inborn-error-of-metabolism.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition position paper on the diagnosis and management of pediatric acute liver failure [^115BjhFk]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2022). High credibility.

Pediatric acute liver failure — oncologic etiologies and diagnostic considerations are outlined: Hematological malignancies, such as leukemia and lymphoma, can rarely present with ALF, and diagnostic clues for hematological malignancies include high fever, hepatosplenomegaly, elevated alkaline phosphatase, lactic dehydrogenase, and peripheral blood film abnormalities. A bone marrow examination may be diagnostic, and acute hepatic failure can also occur after metastatic liver infiltration due to neuroblastoma or other solid tumors. Evaluation of liver histology may be needed, despite the risk of bleeding in patients with coagulopathies, and it is essential to consider malignant infiltration of the liver given the clear contraindication of liver transplantation, which could otherwise be lifesaving in failure due to other etiologies.

### Elevated alkaline phosphatase in infants with parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease reflects bone rather than liver disease [^113wHjg3]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in infants with intestinal failure (IF) can be due to parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease (PNALD) or metabolic bone disease (MBD). The purpose of the study was to determine the utility of serum ALP in the diagnostic criteria for PNALD by measuring tissue-specific levels in infants with IF and PNALD.

Methods

A retrospective review of patient data for 15 infants diagnosed with PNALD between December 2012 and August 2013 was performed. PNALD was defined as the presence of 2 consecutive direct bilirubin (DB) levels > 2 mg/dL. Fractionated serum alkaline phosphatase was measured in each patient, while the DB was > 2 mg/dL. Parathyroid hormone (PTH), vitamin D3, calcium, and phosphate levels were recorded where available.

Results

In 15 infants with PNALD, elevation in total ALP was due to marked elevations in bone-specific ALP. The median liver-specific ALP remained within the normal range. PTH, vitamin D3, calcium, and phosphate levels were within normal limits.

Conclusion

While elevated ALP can reflect biliary stasis, the ALP elevation observed in infants with IF and PNALD is predominantly of bone rather than hepatic origin. An elevated unfractionated ALP in infants with PNALD should therefore raise suspicion of underlying bone disease, rather than being attributed to liver disease alone.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^117MpALN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinicians are required to assess abnormal liver chemistries on a daily basis. The most common liver chemistries ordered are serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. These tests should be termed liver chemistries or liver tests. Hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT levels compared with alkaline phosphatase levels. Cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase level as compared with AST and ALT levels. The majority of bilirubin circulates as unconjugated bilirubin and an elevated conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or cholestasis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the presence of an elevated ALT has been associated with increased liver-related mortality. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33IU/l for males, 19 to 25IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. The degree of elevation of ALT and or AST in the clinical setting helps guide the evaluation. The evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C, assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease, screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. In addition, a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For the evaluation of an alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be undertaken. Total bilirubin elevation can occur in either cholestatic or hepatocellular diseases. Elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

### Transformative therapy in hypophosphatasia [^114sULVf]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical findings of the most common manifestations are shown in figure 1; note that presentation can be multisystemic. Low ALP activity level is the hallmark of HPP and should be assessed when HPP is suspected. Measurement of ALP is easy to perform, readily available and can lead to rapid diagnosis. However, its interpretation requires some care. The normal range for ALP is age- and gender-specific, emphasising the need for appropriate laboratory reference ranges. Some laboratories only have one broad reference range for all ages; physicians should be wary because ALP levels that are normal for adults could represent pathological levels for children. Furthermore, there is often a focus upon elevated ALP for the diagnosis of rickets/osteomalacia, rather than low ALP levels.

Together with low ALP levels, typical radiological features of perinatal, infantile and childhood HPP can confirm the diagnosis. However, the radiological features in mild childhood, adult and odonto-HPP are not always diagnostic. Where the diagnosis is in doubt, confirmatory laboratory testing can include PLP, PPi or urinary phosphoethanolamine levels, which are usually above the reference range in patients with HPP, as well as ALPL mutational analyses.

The presence of any clinical findings shown in figure 1 with a combination of low ALP activity level should result in a working diagnosis of HPP until proven otherwise. Timely access to care and treatment options is dependent on the critical period between symptom onset and diagnosis. This is especially important for patients with perinatal and infantile HPP, where delays may have fatal consequences, or in older patients where treatment with bisphosphonates may worsen the bone phenotype. Improving awareness will increase the likelihood of a correct diagnosis and minimise the period between symptom onset and initiating the newly available, potentially life-saving therapy.

We hope that despite the inconvenience of frequent injections and the high cost of the treatment, this transformative therapy will be implemented for those in whom HPP is currently life-limiting.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^115xNaAK]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Cholestatic liver diseases — evaluation of elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and the role of gamma‑glutamyl transferase (GGT) is outlined as follows: cholestatic liver diseases are associated with elevated alkaline phosphatase, with or without elevated bilirubin, and once alkaline phosphatase has been confirmed to be of hepatic origin, an ultrasound of the liver should be performed to assess the hepatic parenchyma and bile ducts. Biliary dilatation suggests an extrahepatic cause, whereas a non-dilated biliary system suggests that the cause of elevated alkaline phosphatase is intrahepatic; some disease of extrahepatic cholestasis may not be apparent by ultrasound and cholangiography by MR/MRCP or endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography should be undertaken when these disorders are suspected. With isolated alkaline phosphatase elevation, confirmation with GGT, or fractionation of alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes can be used to help differentiate alkaline phosphatase from non-liver sources; however, GGT elevation is not specific for cholestatic liver disease and can be elevated in > 50% of alcoholic patients without obvious evidence of liver disease, so GGT should not be used as a screening test for underlying liver disease in the absence of abnormal liver chemistries. In hospitalized patients with isolated alkaline phosphatase elevations, one study reported that ~80% could be given a clinical diagnosis solely based on history and physical examination, routine labs, and chest X-ray.

### Benign transient hyperphosphatasemia in the pediatric population: a single center cohort study [^113kShy2]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) can be increased in a benign condition known as benign-transient hyperphosphatasemia (BTH). We aimed to evaluate the demographic, and clinical characteristics of infants and children with BTH.

Methods

In our retrospective study, infants and children diagnosed with BTH between September 2019 and September 2023 were included.

Results

Of 249 children with elevated ALP levels, 95 (38.1%) had BTH. The mean age at diagnosis of children with BTH was 2.4 ± 1.3 years (min 0.6 - max 6.2 years). ALP mean value was 2,587 ± 1252 U/L (min 972 - max 5757 U/L). ALP value was an average 7.4 ± 3.6 times higher than the corresponding upper limit of normal. The second measurement was made after an average of 13.2 ± 6 days, and a statistically significant difference was detected compared to the first value, with a decrease of 61 ± 23% in the ALP value (p < 0.001). ALP value returned to normal in an average of 44 ± 29.2 days. Elevated ALP was detected during infection in 49 (51.6%) children. When the sample was divided into those under 2 years of age and aged 2 and over, no statistical difference was observed in ALP levels in the time it took for ALP levels to return to the normal range (p = 0.480).

Conclusions

BTH should be kept in mind if high serum ALP is detected in children without clinical or laboratory suspicion of bone or liver disease. In the follow up detecting a significant decrease trend compared to the first value may be guiding for BTH.

### Establishment of reference intervals for alkaline phosphatase in Pakistani children using a data mining approach [^115XyQyB]. Laboratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To establish reference intervals (RIs) for alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels in Pakistani children using an indirect data mining approach.

Methods

ALP levels analyzed on a Siemens Advia 1800 analyzer using the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry's photometric method for both inpatients and outpatients aged 1 to 17 years between January 2013 and December 2017, including patients from intensive care units and specialty units, were retrieved. RIs were calculated using a previously validated indirect algorithm developed by the German Society of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine's Working Group on Guide Limits.

Results

From a total of 108,845 results, after the exclusion of patients with multiple specimens, RIs were calculated for 24,628 males and 18,083 females with stratification into fine-grained age groups. These RIs demonstrate the complex age- and sex-related ALP dynamics occurring during physiological development.

Conclusion

The population-specific RIs serve to allow an accurate understanding of the fluctuations in analyte activity with increasing age and to support clinical decision making.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism in pediatric patients [^1148U6Gs]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Primary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) is unusual in children. We reviewed our experience with HPT to better characterize these children.

Methods

The retrospective review of patients < 19 years old who underwent parathyroid resection for primary HPT from 1970 to 2000 was performed at a single institution.

Results

Fifty-two patients were identified. Median age was 16.8 years (range: 4–18.9) with a female-to-male ratio of 3:2. Eighty-five percent had an elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) level, and 15% had an inappropriately normal PTH level during hypercalcemia. Serum calcium was elevated in all patients except for 2 with multiple endocrine neoplasma (MEN)-IIA and 1 with familial non-MEN HPT, but both had elevated PTH levels. Alkaline phosphatase levels were significantly higher in children with documented bone involvement. At presentation 41 patients (79%) were symptomatic and end-organ damage (nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, acute pancreatitis, or bone involvement) occurred in 23 patients (44%). Thirty-four patients (65%) had a single adenoma; hyperplasia was identified in 16 patients (27%), and of these cases, 57% occurred in patients diagnosed with MEN-I. Short-term complications included transient hypocalcemia in 29 patients (56%) and transient vocal cord paralysis in 2 patients (4%). Long-term complications were significant for permanent hypocalcemia in 2 patients (4%) and no recurrent laryngeal nerve injuries. No parathyroid abnormalities were identified during exploration in 4 (8%) children. Long-term follow-up was achieved in 98% of patients for a mean and median of 13 years. Resolution of hypercalcemia was achieved in 94% of cases.

Conclusion

The diagnosis of primary HPT in pediatric patients is frequently delayed, is commonly symptomatic, and has significant morbidity. For children in whom HPT is suspected, evaluation of serum calcium and PTH levels is diagnostic in 100% of children. Parathyroid resection is effective at restoring normal serum calcium, has few complications, and is the treatment of choice for children with primary hyperparathyroidism.

### Pediatric intestinal failure-associated liver disease: challenges in identifying clinically relevant biomarkers [^115MaFzi]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD) is complex and diagnosed by concurrent use of parenteral nutrition, clinical presentation, and alterations in hepatic biomarkers exclusive of other causes of liver disease. In comparison with individual measures, composite biomarkers may provide a more effective means for assessing disease progression and response to treatment than single parameters. Since IFALD is considered by some to be a type of drug-induced liver injury (DILI), those diagnostic criteria could potentially be used in this population. Using a preexisting database of children treated for IFALD, our aim was to determine if a similar composite biomarker could be applied to this population.

Study Design

Adult DILI criteria were applied at baseline, when treatment for IFALD (ie, direct bilirubin ≥ 2.0 mg/dL) was initiated.

Results

A total of 214 patients with IFALD treated at Boston Children's Hospital were identified; 168 patients were eligible for analysis. Most patients analyzed were male (61%) and preterm (87%). Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ≥ 2× upper limit of normal (ULN) captured the least amount of DILI (11%), while γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) ≥ 1× ULN accounted for the most (62%). Using adult DILI criteria, 60 (39%) patients with IFALD were found to have DILI. Substituting GGT ≥ 1× ULN for ALP ≥ 2× ULN improved the sensitivity, with 105 (69%) of patients meeting at least 1 criterion for DILI.

Conclusion

Numerous challenges made it difficult to apply the DILI criteria to children with IFALD. Direct bilirubin, fractionated ALP, and perhaps GGT may be more suitable. Given its complex etiology and the age-based differences due to hepatic immaturity and growth, a more suitable composite marker needs to be developed to assess IFALD in this population.

### Vitamin D status and bone biomarkers in childhood cancer [^115hKnRX]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Early detection of abnormalities in bone turnover may be facilitated by assessing biomarkers of bone metabolism including vitamin D status. In many children with cancer, biomarkers of bone formation (osteocalcin, bone specific alkaline phosphatase and carboxy-(or N terminal) propeptide of type 1 procollagen) were observed to be suppressed, while bone resorption was elevated as measured by serum cross-linked (or C-terminal) telopeptide of type 1 collagen. Insulin-like growth factor 1, which stimulates bone formation, may be suppressed indirectly indicating a growth hormone insufficiency. Leptin may also play a role in bone remodeling as hyperleptinemia has been observed in association with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Evaluation of bone status using such biomarkers is complicated by the lack of universally accepted reference values and the variation by age, gender, or pubertal status. Etiologic factors contributing to the observed skeletal morbidities include disease process, chemotherapy (drugs such as glucocorticoids and methotrexate) and radiotherapy. Other factors common to children with cancer, such as chronic inflammation, dietary changes and physical inactivity, must also be taken into account. The current evidence for abnormalities in biomarkers of vitamin D status and bone turnover will be the focus of this review of published studies.

Limitations of Current Monitoring Tools in Children (< 18 years)

Current monitoring tools in children are adequate to allow the clinician to determine the severity of the disease (mild, moderate, or severe) at baseline and whether the child's disease manifestations are improving, stable, or worsening. While hypophosphatemia is a hallmark feature of XLH, the serum phosphorus level does not appear to provide the best gauge of a child's overall disease trajectory. Other biochemical indicators (ie, ALP) plus structural and functional outcomes (growth velocity, lower limb deformity, rickets severity) provide more robust evidence for disease severity and evolution with therapy.

Clinical Manifestations, Biochemical and Radiographic Evaluation in Children and Adolescents

Characteristic clinical features in children include lower limb deformities, dolichocephaly due to craniosynostosis, recurrent dental abscesses, growth delay, impaired muscle strength and endurance, delayed motor milestones, bone pain, and sometimes osteomalacia-related fractures or pseudofractures. The Chiari 1 malformation has been described in up to 25% of children with XLH. Cranial abnormalities may be asymptomatic or associated with headaches, vomiting, papilledema, and neurologic symptoms. Syringomyelia may also occur. Osteophytes, enthesopathies, and spinal stenosis do not typically develop until adulthood. Tinnitus is frequent, even in childhood, and may be associated with overt hearing loss.

Figure 2.
GRADEd initial assessment recommendations in children with XL.

In the newborn period, the serum phosphorus and ALP values are often normal for age, but by 3 months of age, the classic biochemical profile, with hypophosphatemia and increasing ALP, is present in most infants with XLH (Table 1). Circulating parathyroid hormone (PTH) is usually normal or modestly elevated, which distinguishes XLH from the more substantial elevations in ALP and PTH typical of nutritional rickets. Consistent with FGF23 overproduction, FGF23 is expected to be inappropriately normal or high, while serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is usually low or inappropriately normal despite hypophosphatemia (Table 2). Serum phosphorus, ALP, and tubular maximum phosphate reabsorption adjusted for glomerular filtration rate (TmP/GFR) vary with age in childhood; therefore, it is important to use appropriate normative data for age when interpreting results.

### Clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of X-linked hypophosphataemia [^115PLRtA]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2019). High credibility.

Biochemical characteristics

The biochemical hallmarks of XLH are hypophosphataemia due to renal phosphate wasting, increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels and elevated intact FGF23 levels. A positive family history of XLH, elevated ALP levels, decreased serum phosphate concentrations associated with renal phosphate wasting and/or the identification of a PHEX mutation can help to identify affected children within the first weeks of life. Of note, serum levels of phosphate might be in the normal range within the first 3–4 months of life. Renal phosphate wasting should be evaluated by calculating the tubular maximum reabsorption of phosphate per glomerular filtration rate (TmP/GFR)(Table 1). In patients with insufficient phosphate intake, or impaired intestinal absorption (which might be suspected by low urinary levels of phosphate), TmP/GFR can be falsely low until serum levels of phosphate are restored to normal. Although, plasma levels of intact FGF23 are usually elevated, normal levels of FGF23 do not exclude XLH but should be interpreted as inappropriately normal in the setting of hypophosphataemia. FGF23 levels are also influenced by other factors, in particular phosphate intake and vitamin D therapy. Therefore, FGF23 levels are most informative in untreated patients. FGF23 levels are elevated in several other forms of hypophosphataemic rickets (Table 2), and the normal range varies considerably according to the assay used. Serum concentrations of calcium are usually in the lower normal range, and urinary calcium is low owing to impaired 1,25(OH) 2 vitamin D synthesis and consequently decreased intestinal calcium absorption. In contrast to calcipenic rickets, parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels are usually at the upper limit of the normal range or even slightly elevated. Circulating levels of 1,25(OH) 2 vitamin D are low or inappropriately normal in the setting of hypophosphataemia.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113XoUqa]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Response to abnormal liver blood tests: outcomes and pathways￼

As indicated in figure 1 the presence of unexplained clinical jaundice or suspicion of possible hepatic or biliary malignancy should lead to an immediate referral. In all other adults with incidentally raised liver enzymes it is important to take a careful history and perform a targeted clinical examination to look for the cause. Liver enzymes can occasionally be raised owing to intercurrent illness, although when liver blood tests were repeated, 84% of tests remained abnormal on retesting after 1 month, and even at 2 years 75% remained abnormal. Thus, in a patient with abnormal liver blood tests it is not recommended to simply repeat the same panel of tests but to determine the cause unless there is a high index of clinical suspicion that it is a transient finding. In children, there should be a low threshold for referral to a paediatrician for further investigation, as the most common causes of liver dysfunction in adults are less common in children, and there is a wider differential diagnosis.

Figure 1
Response to abnormal liver blood tests. This figure details the initial response to abnormal liver blood tests. Boxes in yellow indicate the initial evaluation of the clinical presentation. Patients with marked derangement of liver blood tests, synthetic failure and/or suspicious clinical symptoms/signs should be considered for urgent referral to secondary care (red box). For the remainder, a clinical history alongside evaluation of the pattern of liver blood test derangement will determine choice of pathway and is shown in the grey boxes. A grey box indicates all the tests that should be requested at that stage rather than a hierarchy within it. The presence of metabolic syndrome criteria should be sought to support a diagnosis of NAFLD. For children, the text should be consulted for modification of recommendation. Areas of diagnostic uncertainty are indicated in orange boxes and the decision for repeat testing or referral to secondary care will be influenced by the magnitude of enzyme elevation and clinical context. Green boxes indicate final/definitive outcomes for users of the pathway. *Abnormal USS may well include extrahepatic biliary obstruction due to malignancy, which should result in urgent referral.

Benign transient hyperphosphatasemia of infancy (BTH) is a condition characterized by disproportionately high levels of serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP). We report 4 cases of healthy patients with an elevated SAP. The mean age of the patients was 33 (14–52) months, with three females and one male. All children had a normal physical exam and anthropometric measures. The maximum values of serum alkaline phosphatase recorded in the 4 patients were: 11900, 6500, 9700 and 7600 UI/L respectively, with the rest of the laboratory exams and diagnostic images being normal. The clinical course of all the patients was favourable and no patient presented signs of symptoms of illness. Blood was drawn on 6 occasions in patients 1 and 5 occasions in the rest. Benign transient hyperphosphatasemia of infancy was diagnosed. It is important to know the characteristics of this condition to order the necessary amount of complementary studies.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^111Zqb9T]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG clinical guideline — summary statements on abnormal liver chemistries state that liver chemistries including ALT, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are markers of liver injury, not liver function, and should be referred to as liver chemistries, or liver tests; albumin, bilirubin, and prothrombin time are markers of hepatocellular function that can be influenced by extrahepatic factors; elevations of AST and/or ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin suggest hepatocellular injury and are the abnormal liver chemistries that require assessment and potential evaluation; ALT is a more specific marker of hepatic injury than AST; and an elevated alkaline phosphatase level of hepatic origin may be confirmed by elevation of gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) or fractionation of alkaline phosphatase.

Acute liver failure due to Wilson disease (WD) — Biochemical ratio approach: Using readily available parameters, a ratio of alkaline phosphatase to total bilirubin of < 4 was 94% sensitive and 96% specific, whereas a ratio of AST to ALT > 2.2 was 94% sensitive but only 86% specific; the combination of both ratios (alkaline phosphatase to total bilirubin < 4 and AST to ALT > 2.2) was 100% sensitive and 100% specific for diagnosing WD in their cohort, and this approach appears to work less well for identifying ALF due WD in the pediatric age bracket.

### Current practices in monitoring children and adults with X-linked hypophosphatemia: a global survey of expert experience [^117BMLou]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Biochemical assessment

Biochemical assessment includes disease-specific measures such as serum phosphorus, ALP, FGF23, and TmP/GFR and monitoring for potential complications including serum creatinine, estimated GFR (eGFR), calcium, PTH, and urine calcium excretion. Biochemical assessment will be more extensive when the diagnosis is being established and more focused during disease monitoring. The goal of treatment with conventional therapy is to normalize bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BsALP) and not necessarily normalize serum phosphorus. Avoiding elevations in PTH and serum and urine calcium is advised. Please refer to Table 1 for optimal laboratory assessment practices.

Table 1.
Laboratory assessment best practice

Radiological assessment

Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) has limited clinical utility in the assessment of osteomalacia in XLH due to falsely elevated results in association with ligamentous ossification and lamina thickening in the spine. Thus, the diagnostic value of a hip bone mineral density (BMD) may be greater than that of a spine BMD. In addition, the cross-sectional area of the bones is increased in XLH resulting in an increase in areal BMD in both children and adults. Despite limitations, DXA is used in adults with XLH by panel members to assess for the possibility of superimposed conditions of low bone mass. Declines in areal BMD as measured by DXA raise the possibility of an additional secondary cause for bone loss such as the development of secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism, suboptimal treatment, or an additional skeletal insult such as estrogen deficiency. Whole lower extremity X-rays are used to assess for bony deformity. Focused X-rays help evaluate joint damage of hips and knees, spinal involvement, enthesopathy, and pseudofractures. Renal ultrasound is suggested for monitoring nephrocalcinosis. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain (Chiari malformation) or spine (spinal stenosis, syringomyelia) is indicated in the presence of neurological symptoms and signs. A postauthorization safety study of burosumab (NCT03193476), the International XLH Registry, is further evaluating the utility of echocardiography, electrocardiography, and hearing assessments in adults with XLH.

### Asparaginase-associated toxicity in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^112bPw9c]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2016). Low credibility.

Hepatic toxicity

Hepatic toxicity associated with asparaginase use is rarely associated with fatal complications; however, clinical outcomes may be negatively affected if significant delays in treatment are required due to asparaginase-associated dysfunction. Asparaginase use is more commonly associated with abnormalities in liver function and hepatic transaminases as well as elevations in bilirubin and alkaline phosphates. The mechanism of action by which asparaginase causes hepatic dysfunction is unknown; however, the reduction in protein synthesis associated with asparaginase therapy is believed to play a role. The degree to which hepatic dysfunction in patients undergoing treatment for ALL can be attributed to asparaginase use is unclear, as many regimens include the use of several potentially hepatotoxic drugs (e.g. corticosteroids, vinca alkaloids, anthracyclines, and antimetabolites). Elevated levels of hepatic transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin have been reported in 30–60% of patients receiving asparaginase as part of multiagent therapy for ALL. In a study of 118 children receiving native E. coli asparaginase or PEG-asparaginase, abnormal liver function (grade 3/4), including elevated transaminases and hyperbilirubinemia, was found in 8% of patients receiving native E. coli asparaginase and in 5% of patients receiving PEG-asparaginase. In children and adults receiving Erwinia asparaginase, grade 3/4 liver toxicity has been reported in approximately 4% of patients. There are no clear pediatric guidelines for the management of asparaginase in patients with hepatic toxicity, and treatment recommendations vary across protocols. In the DCOG ALL-11 pediatric protocol, patients are required to display aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase < 10 × ULN and no signs of jaundice with bilirubin < 3 × ULN prior to starting asparaginase treatment. Recommendations for adolescent and young adults (AYA) call for witholding asparaginase in patients with grade 3/4 hepatotoxicity (alanine or glutamine aminotransferase elevation > 5 × ULN) with the option to rechallenge patients with careful monitoring if complications resolve [Table I].

### The significance of isolated elevation of serum aminotransferases in infants and young children [^1134VH4e]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

The aim of this study was to assess the clinical significance and prognosis of a prolonged isolated elevation of serum aminotransferases without cholestasis (> 3 months) in infants and young children, investigated for a variety of conditions, and to determine a protocol for their follow-up and investigation.

Methods

A combined prospective-retrospective analysis of apparently healthy babies and young children with isolated elevation of serum aminotransferases of at least 1.5 times above the norm for age which persisted for at least 3 months and whose creatine phosphokinase (CK), gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin levels remained normal throughout the study duration. The children underwent the following investigations: abdominal ultrasound and infectious, metabolic and/or immunological investigation depending on the duration of the abnormality.

Results

Six children were eliminated following the finding of positive cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigen in the urine. 72 children were investigated (47 males and 25 females). The duration of serum aminotransferases elevation was 3–36 months (average 12.4, median 11.5 months). The initial, maximal and final alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values were 85.5, 140.5 and 39.8 IU/l, respectively. Of seven children who had liver biopsies performed, three (42.8%) were suspected of having a glycogen storage disease which was not confirmed enzymatically. Four biopsies revealed non-specific histological changes.

Conclusions

Isolated elevation of serum aminotransferases in healthy looking young children is mostly a benign condition that usually resolves within a year. If no pathology is found during routine investigation, these children can be followed conservatively. Liver biopsy does not contribute much to the diagnosis and is probably unnecessary.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^114Kk3U6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Abnormal liver chemistries — bilirubin and cholestasis evaluation: In contrast to indirect hyperbilirubinemia, conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia generally implies the presence of parenchymal liver damage or biliary obstruction. There are two rare inherited conditions associated with direct hyperbilirubinemia: Dubin–Johnson syndrome and Rotor syndrome. An elevated bilirubin should be evaluated by determining conjugated and unconjugated fractions of bilirubin. If there are signs of acute liver failure, urgent hepatology consultation with referral to a liver transplant center should be undertaken immediately. Those who present with an elevation in alkaline phosphatase with normal AST, ALT, and bilirubin levels should have their alkaline phosphatase elevation confirmed with a GGT level and if elevated a right upper quadrant ultrasound of the liver should be ordered. If the imaging is normal, autoimmune markers should be ordered. A liver biopsy may ultimately be required to obtain a diagnosis. Extrahepatic causes such as hemolysis should also be assessed.

### Hepatitis in children with tuberculosis: a case report and review of the literature [^116mCT2x]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Studies suggest that there are five clinical-histologic forms of liver involvement in patients with TB disease: miliary, granulomatous, nodular, ductal and nodal TB. Of all those, the form associated with miliary TB represents the most common in adults and entails widespread liver dissemination and injury. The frequency of liver involvement in children due to primary TB is unknown, and although clinical experience suggest that clinically apparent hepatic disease in is rare in pediatric patients, elevated LFTs and ALP before initiating anti-TB treatment may suggest diffuse hepatic disease, which is likely what occurred in our case.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical guidelines recommend to screen for LFTs before initiating TB treatment in adults. LFTs then require frequent monitoring only in patients with underlying liver or biliary tract disease, receiving treatment with other hepatotoxic drugs, concomitant HIV infection or previous drug-induced liver injury history, due to the hepatotoxicity associated with first-line agents. In children, small studies have reported rates of hepatotoxicity associated with TB treatment that varied from 8 to 40%, although overall, the occurrence of drug-induced liver toxicity in children is considerably lower than in adults. Nevertheless, baseline LFTs could serve to monitor its potential development and help to identify hepatic TB, for which early identification and management has been associated with better outcomes.

### Cholestatic hepatitis induced by Epstein-Barr virus in a pediatric population [^111THBwC]. Clinical Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

We present 5 cases of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced cholestatic hepatitis (CH) and review all additional pediatric cases from the literature.

Design

The medical records of 5 patients with EBV-induced CH were reviewed. A comprehensive review of the literature was performed.

Results

Including our patients, a total of 17 patients with EBV-induced CH were reviewed. The average age was 11 years (range 1–18 years); male to female ratio was 0.9:1. The most common presenting symptoms included fever, jaundice, and cervical lymphadenopathy. However, a significant number of patients presented with jaundice alone, without other suggestive signs of an EBV infection. Hepatocellular enzyme levels were significantly higher than in classical infectious mononucleosis. In many cases, serum alkaline phosphatase was also elevated, accompanied by direct hyperbilirubinemia.

Conclusion

EBV infection should be included in the differential diagnosis of CH in all age groups. In the vast majority, full recovery is expected.

### A diagnostic algorithm for children with low alkaline phosphatase activities: lessons learned from laboratory screening for Hypophosphatasia [^11625DLW]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To explore the role of laboratory screening for hypophosphatasia and propose a diagnostic pathway for children with low serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities.

Study Design

A retrospective hospital-based study over an 8-year period was conducted to identify children younger than 16 years of age with low ALP activity (< 100 U/L). Study-positive patients were contacted for repeat sampling, and those with persistently low ALP had plasma pyridoxal-5'-phosphate and urinary phosphoethanolamine measured.

Results

Of 323064 analyzed samples, 1526 had ALP activities < 100 U/L. Most patients had transient hypophosphatasemia. Of 50 patients with last-recorded ALP < 100 U/L, 32 were excluded given previous ALP > 100 U/L. Eighteen were identified as study-positive. Of the 15 surviving children, 13 were traceable. Four had persistently low ALP activity on retesting, of whom 2 had raised pyridoxal-5'-phosphate and phosphoethanolamine concentrations and were subsequently tested for ALPL gene mutations; a 4-year-old asymptomatic girl with a novel homozygous ALPL missense mutation and a 23-year-old female with a heterozygous mutation. There was significant overlap in ALP activities between study-positive and 11 current patients with hypophosphatasia. We propose a diagnostic algorithm for children with low ALP activities based on clinical and biochemical variables.

Conclusions

Patients with persistently low ALP activity require further clinical, biochemical, and radiological assessment for hypophosphatasia, even in the absence of clinical symptoms. The proposed diagnostic algorithm for children with low ALP will facilitate early detection of cases of hypophosphatasia, which, with the availability of enzyme replacement for hypophosphatasia, can be life-saving or avoid years of undiagnosed morbidity.

### Nutritional rickets in ichthyosis and response to calcipotriene… [^112AhSW1]. publications.aap.org (2004). Low credibility.

Nutritional rickets has occasionally been described in children with lamellar ichthyosis, but their vitamin D endocrine status has not been described. We report 3 cases of vitamin D-deficiency rickets associated with ichthyosis in African children. A 13-month-old Nigerian boy with lamellar ichthyosis had rib beading, elevated alkaline phosphatase, and rachitic changes on radiographs. His rickets did not resolve with calcium therapy, and his 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was low. His rickets resolved with parenteral vitamin D treatment, but his skin did not improve. Topical 0. 005% calcipotriene was similarly ineffective in improving the child's skin condition. An 8-year-old Nigerian boy with life-long skin findings consistent with lamellar ichthyosis had windswept deformity of the legs with rib beading and enlargement of the wrists and ankles.

Radiographs showed active rickets, and the boy had an elevated alkaline phosphatase level and a decreased calcium level. Before knowing that his 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was low, he was treated with calcium and showed radiologic improvement. The skin did not improve with resolution of the rickets but did improve with unilateral topical application of 0. 005% calcipotriene. A 7-year-old South African girl presented with progressive windswept deformities of the legs and a 4-year history of skin disease. Radiographs and biochemical data confirmed active rickets. Her rickets improved dramatically with vitamin D treatment. Thus, 3 African children with ichthyosis developed vitamin D-deficiency rickets, probably because of a combination of impaired skin production and sunlight avoidance. This is consistent with previous findings of hypovitaminosis D in adults with ichthyosis and other disorders of keratinization.

Measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D may be indicated in children with ichthyosis to identify those at risk for vitamin D-deficiency rickets, because it is possible that the cutaneous synthesis of vitamin D in such children is impaired.

### Screening for hypophosphatasia: does biochemistry lead the way? [^1151RjiR]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Patients with childhood hypophosphatasia (HPP) often have unspecific symptoms. It was our aim to identify patients with mild forms of HPP by laboratory data screening for decreased alkaline phosphatase (AP) within a pediatric population.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective hospital-based data screening for AP activity below the following limits: Girls: ≤ 12 years: < 125 U/L; > 12 years: < 50 U/L Boys: ≤ 14 years: < 125 U/L; > 14 years: < 70 U/L. Screening positive patients with otherwise unexplained hypophosphatasemia were invited for further diagnostics: Re-test of AP activity, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) in hemolyzed whole blood, phosphoethanolamine (PEA) in serum and urine, and inorganic pyrophosphate in urine. Sequencing of the ALPL gene was performed in patients with clinical and/or laboratory abnormalities suspicious for HPP.

Results

We assessed a total of 14,913 samples of 6,731 patients and identified 393 screening-positive patients. The majority of patients were excluded due to known underlying diseases causing AP depression. Of the 30 patients who participated in the study, three had a decrease in AP activity in combination with an increase in PLP and PEA. A heterozygous ALPL mutation was detected in each of them: One patient with a short stature was diagnosed with childhood-HPP and started with enzyme replacement therapy. The remaining two are considered as mutation carriers without osseous manifestation of the disease.

Conclusions

A diagnostic algorithm based on decreased AP is able to identify patients with ALPL mutation after exclusion of the differential diagnoses of hypophosphatasemia and with additional evidence of increased AP substrates.

### Clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of X-linked hypophosphataemia [^1157JGuq]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2019). High credibility.

Biochemical follow-up

Serum level of ALP is a reliable biomarker of rickets activity and osteomalacia in children and adults. Given that bone-specific ALP represents ~80–90% of total ALP in the serum of children, total ALP might be used in this population. In adults, bone-specific ALP is preferred given that ~50% of circulating ALP originates from hepatocytes. When rachitic or osteomalacic bones are undertreated, ALP levels are elevated and urinary levels of calcium are usually low. By contrast, when rickets is healed, ALP levels tend to normalize and urinary calcium levels start to increase. PTH should be measured regularly as secondary hyperparathyroidism is promoted by oral phosphate supplementation. Suppressed PTH levels suggest that the dose of active vitamin D is disproportionately high compared with phosphate supplementation. Measurement of serum and urinary levels of calcium is required to evaluate the safety of active vitamin D. Spot urine samples are preferred as they are simple to perform, especially in young children. Alternatively, 24-hour urine collections can be performed in toilet-trained patients. We do not recommend regular measurement of serum levels of FGF23 in treated patients as it does not guide therapy.

In patients treated with burosumab, fasting serum phosphate level is a biomarker of efficacy and should be monitored to titrate the treatment in children and to exclude hyperphosphataemia. In some patients, burosumab might initially normalize TmP/GFR while serum level of phosphate is still below the normal range owing to the high demand for phosphate of the bone. In this setting, an increase in burosumab dose will not necessarily result in improved bone healing. Therefore, we suggest that TmP/GFR should be analysed together with fasting serum phosphate levels as a measure of drug efficacy. Serum levels of 1,25(OH) 2 vitamin D might increase under burosumab therapy; we suggest measuring these levels every 6 months and analysing them together with the urinary calcium excretion as safety parameters.

### Fosinopril (fosinopril sodium) [^111vbCcm]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Laboratory Test Abnormalities

Serum Electrolytes: Hyperkalemia, (see PRECAUTIONS); hyponatremia, (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions; With diuretics).

BUN/Serum Creatinine: Elevations, usually transient and minor, of BUN or serum creatinine have been observed. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, there were no significant differences in the number of patients experiencing increases in serum creatinine (outside the normal range or 1.33 times the pre-treatment value) between the fosinopril and placebo treatment groups. Rapid reduction of longstanding or markedly elevated blood pressure by any antihypertensive therapy can result in decreases in the glomerular filtration rate and, in turn, lead to increases in BUN or serum creatinine. (See PRECAUTIONS: General .)

Hematology: In controlled trials, a mean hemoglobin decrease of 0.1 g/dL was observed in fosinopril treated patients. In individual patients decreases in hemoglobin or hematocrit were usually transient, small, and not associated with symptoms. No patient was discontinued from therapy due to the development of anemia. Other: Neutropenia (see WARNINGS), leukopenia and eosinophilia.

Liver Function Tests: Elevations of transaminases, LDH, alkaline phosphatase and serum bilirubin have been reported. Fosinopril therapy was discontinued because of serum transaminase elevations in 0.7% of patients. In the majority of cases, the abnormalities were either present at baseline or were associated with other etiologic factors. In those cases which were possibly related to fosinopril therapy, the elevations were generally mild and transient and resolved after discontinuation of therapy.

Pediatric Patients

The adverse experience profile for pediatric patients is similar to that seen in adult patients with hypertension. The long-term effects of fosinopril sodium on growth and development have not been studied.

In pediatric trials of dasatinib in chronic phase CML after at least 2 years of treatment, adverse reactions associated with bone growth and development were reported in 5 (5.2%) patients, one of which was severe in intensity (Growth Retardation Grade 3). These 5 cases included cases of epiphyses delayed fusion, osteopenia, growth retardation, and gynecomastia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. Of these 5 cases, 1 case of osteopenia and 1 case of gynecomastia resolved during treatment.

5.11 Hepatotoxicity

Dasatinib may cause hepatotoxicity as measured by elevations in bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitor transaminases at baseline and monthly or as clinically indicated during treatment. Reduce dose, withhold, or permanently discontinue dasatinib based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. When dasatinib is administered in combination with chemotherapy, liver toxicity in the form of transaminase elevation and hyperbilirubinemia has been observed. Monitor hepatic function when dasatinib is used in combination with chemotherapy.

### High frequencies of elevated alkaline phosphatase activity and rickets exist in extremely low birth weight infants despite current nutritional support [^116rK72y]. BMC Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

All radiographs of these patients which were performed for the purpose of evaluating for the presence of osteopenia and rickets were reviewed by an individual pediatric radiologist who was masked to the laboratory values associated with these patients. Radiographs obtained for these evaluations included images of the wrist(s) and/or knee(s). Patients were classified as normal, as having osteopenia (evidence of low mineral density of the bones), or as having rickets (loss of the zone of provisional calcification or metaphyseal cupping and/or fraying).

SPSS (Version 16, Chicago, IL, 2007) was used to analyze the data. General linear modeling was used to make group comparisons. Data are presented as the Mean ± Standard Deviation.

### Primary sclerosing cholangitis in children with inflammatory bowel disease: an ESPGHAN position paper from the hepatology committee and the IBD porto group [^114ssva1]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

4.1.2 Practical guidance

In adults, it is recommended to evaluate a diagnosis of PSC when serum markers of cholestasis, including alkaline phosphatase, GGT and/or bilirubin, are elevated. Due to its variation with age because of increased bone turnover and growth, alkaline phosphatase is not a reliable marker of biliary injury in children, hence should not be included in diagnostic testing.

In children with IBD, abnormalities in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and GGT frequently occur. This usually involves mild elevations (less than twice the upper limit of normal [ULN]) associated with a transient and undefined etiology. If mild liver enzyme elevations persist for more than 1 month, further evaluation is required. Moderate to marked liver enzyme elevations (≥ 2x ULN) warrant prompt investigation of etiology. Table 2 illustrates the common causes of liver enzyme abnormalities in IBD. As corticosteroids and antimetabolites could affect the presentation and course of the liver disease, liver enzymes should be checked at the time of IBD diagnosis and at regular intervals thereafter. All patients with IBD should have their liver enzymes tested half yearly as a minimum, although in practice the majority of the children with IBD will have them screened much more frequently than this.

Table 2
Common causes of liver enzyme elevations in children with inflammatory bowel disease.

The most common cause of significantly elevated liver enzymes in children with IBD is drug‐induced liver injury (DILI). Most drugs used for the treatment of IBD, as well as antibiotics, are known to to be hepatotoxic and can be found on a searchable database maintained by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive, and Kidney Diseases, called LiverTox. Attributing abnormalities in ALT and GGT to any of these drugs requires systematic evaluation, including time to liver test abnormality after the implicated drug has been started (latency), resolution after the drug is stopped (dechallenge), recurrence on re‐exposure (rechallenge) and information on the drug's potential for hepatotoxicity (likelihood).

### Global guidance for the recognition, diagnosis, and management of tumor-induced osteomalacia [^116ET9sF]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Biochemical workup and features

The challenges associated with diagnostic testing have been recently reviewed by Brandi et al; for the purposes of this global guidance document, we will focus on the most salient points for clinicians to bear in mind. The first necessary step to diagnosis requires measuring serum phosphate in anyone being evaluated for musculoskeletal symptoms (Fig. 2). Serum phosphate should be measured on a morning, fasting blood specimen. Serum phosphate concentration is normally higher in young children and decreases with age; therefore, it is important to make sure that an age‐specific normal range is used. In adults, hypophosphatemia is defined as levels below 0.8 mmol/L (2.5 mg/dL). To establish chronic hypophosphatemia, there must be two values below the normal range on at least two occasions ≥ 2 weeks apart.

One study showed that, among 144 patients with TIO, 43.1% of cases with hypophosphatemia were not treated or misdiagnosed, and only 11.8% of patients seeking medical care for the first time were tested for serum phosphate.

Comprehensive laboratory evaluation should include complete blood count, fasting serum phosphate, serum creatinine, calcium, albumin, and total alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Additional variables, including PTH, 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH) 2 D, and FGF23, should also be measured (Table 3, Fig. 2). It should be emphasized that not all assays are standardized, and not all labs use the same reference values, so care must be taken when interpreting results.

Measurement of 25(OH)D levels is necessary for diagnosing vitamin D deficiency, a common cause of hypophosphatemia and rickets/osteomalacia that must be differentiated from TIO. However, vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency is frequent in the general population, and a low 25(OH)D level does not rule out the possibility of concurrent TIO. In fact, persistent hypophosphatemia after correction of vitamin D deficiency should prompt consideration that the patient may have TIO. Iron deficiency may indicate a need for potentially different patient management.

### How to use… alkaline phosphatase in neonatology [^116BVg9u]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2012). Low credibility.

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is regularly measured in clinical practice. Changes in serum levels are observed in a number of clinical conditions. In neonatology, it has been proposed as a useful marker for both a diagnosis and an indication of the severity of metabolic bone disease (MBD) in infants born preterm. Nutritional practices, aimed at reducing the occurrence or severity of MBD, have led to ALP being proposed as a stand-alone means of monitoring treatment. The current evidence does not support this use: ALP only achieves usefulness in a diagnostic and monitoring capacity when combined with other serum and imaging techniques.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^113LJvTk]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Abnormal liver chemistries — bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, and prothrombin time interpretation includes that an elevated GGT suggests that the alkaline phosphatase elevation is of hepatic origin, alkaline phosphatase levels increase in children and the elderly, especially females over 50 years of age, and the total serum bilirubin is usually < 1.1 mg/dl with an elevated direct bilirubin indicating hepatocellular dysfunction or cholestasis; fractionation of total bilirubin is most helpful when the ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase levels are normal or near normal, and if the total bilirubin is elevated and fractionation shows the majority of the elevation is unconjugated bilirubin, hepatocellular disease is unlikely; albumin is a plasma protein exclusively synthesized by the liver with a circulating half-life of 3 weeks, a reduction in albumin (normal ≥ 3.5 g/dl) usually indicates liver disease of more than 3 weeks duration, and prothrombin time may be prolonged in patients with severe liver disease of < 24 h duration.

### Management of bone disease in cystinosis: statement from an international conference [^1144dvME]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

3.3 Assessing CMBD

Serum mineral and enzyme values provide measures of bone health in both children and adults with cystinosis (Table 2). In children with hypophosphatemic rickets, serum phosphate, bicarbonate, and potassium reflect renal losses and the efficacy of replacement therapy, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is a biomarker of rickets and osteomalacia. 37 Elevated ALP also indicates increased bone turnover as a feature of CKD‐MBD. Measurement of serum PTH, calcium, 25(OH) vitamin D, and phosphate also serve as the mainstays of monitoring for CKD‐MBD. 38 Nevertheless, infants and adolescents with cystinosis may develop bone disease despite largely "normal" blood levels of phosphate, calcium and ALP; normal blood levels have a wide standard range and daily fluctuations, are not always biochemically evident, and may have a large cumulative effect upon bone metabolism. Therefore, urine losses for calcium and phosphate should be monitored as well.

Table 2
Recommended tests for CMBD

New biomarkers may better reflect bone cell activity in CMBD, 39 and pediatric reference values are available. 40 Bone ALP, an osteoblast enzyme, is a sensitive and specific marker of bone formation and remodeling during periods of rapid longitudinal growth and in cases of rickets. 24, 38 TRAP5b is considered a specific marker of late osteoclast differentiation, 38 and sclerostin is an osteocyte‐derived inhibitor of bone formation. 38, 41, 42 Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), released by osteocytes and osteoblasts, helps maintain mineral and vitamin D homeostasis, and is the earliest detectable abnormality in bone mineral metabolism in CKD patients. 38, 43 However, FGF23 levels are typically normal in patients with cystinosis prior to dialysis, possibly due to hypophosphatemia. 44

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^112XLmib]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical pattern recognition for liver blood tests

There are three common patterns of abnormal liver test results whose recognition can aid diagnosis:
Isolated raised bilirubin — most commonly caused by Gilbert's syndrome (affects 5–8% of the population). Consider haemolysis in patients with anaemia. Repeat liver blood tests on a fasting sample with a full blood count and a direct and indirect bilirubin; the total bilirubin should rise further, owing to the indirect component, and there should be no evidence of anaemia. If the patient is anaemic, haemolysis needs to be excluded by requesting reticulocyte count/lactate dehydrogenase/haptoglobin. If the unconjugated bilirubin is more markedly elevated (> 40 μmol/L) then rarer causes such as Crigler-Najjar syndromeshould be considered and genetic testing undertaken.
Cholestatic — predominantly raised ALP and GGT indicate cholestasis. Common causes include primary biliary cholangitis, PSC, biliary obstruction (stones, strictures, neoplasia, etc), hepatic congestion and drug-induced liver injury. In children, additional disorders that may present with cholestasis include biliary tract abnormalities and genetic disorders of bile synthesis and excretion. However, an isolated raised ALP may be caused by vitamin D deficiency and not be liver related, or it may relate to raised values during periods of rapid growth in childhood, and thus the presence of a concomitantly elevated GGT can help confirm the cause of liver disease. In children with specific inherited disorders of bile acid synthesis and transport, however, GGT is characteristically low or normal. In these disorders, cholestasis occurs without GGT elevation.
Hepatitic — predominantly raised ALT and AST indicate hepatocellular liver injury (hepatitis). Common causes include viral hepatitis, NAFLD, ARLD, AIH and drug-induced liver injury. Details of the approach to these liver blood test abnormalities are given in the subsequent section on outcomes and pathways.

5.10 Effects on Growth and Development in Pediatric Patients

In pediatric trials of dasatinib in chronic phase CML after at least 2 years of treatment, adverse reactions associated with bone growth and development were reported in 5 (5.2%) patients, one of which was severe in intensity (Growth Retardation Grade 3). These 5 cases included cases of epiphyses delayed fusion, osteopenia, growth retardation, and gynecomastia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. Of these 5 cases, 1 case of osteopenia and 1 case of gynecomastia resolved during treatment.

Monitor bone growth and development in pediatric patients.

5.11 Hepatotoxicity

PHYRAGO may cause hepatotoxicity as measured by elevations in bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitor transaminases at baseline and monthly or as clinically indicated during treatment. Reduce dose, withhold, or permanently discontinue PHYRAGO based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. When dasatinib is administered in combination with chemotherapy, liver toxicity in the form of transaminase elevation and hyperbilirubinemia has been observed. Monitor hepatic function when PHYRAGO is used in combination with chemotherapy.

### Effects of burosumab treatment on mineral metabolism in children and adolescents with X-linked hypophosphatemia [^111qqPvQ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Context

Burosumab has been approved for the treatment of children and adults with X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH). Real-world data and evidence for its efficacy in adolescents are lacking.

Objective

To assess the effects of 12 months of burosumab treatment on mineral metabolism in children (aged < 12 years) and adolescents (aged 12–18 years) with XLH.

Design

Prospective national registry.

Setting

Hospital clinics.

Patients

A total of 93 patients with XLH (65 children, 28 adolescents).

Main Outcome Measures

Z scores for serum phosphate, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and renal tubular reabsorption of phosphate per glomerular filtration rate (TmP/GFR) at 12 months.

Results

At baseline, patients showed hypophosphatemia (-4.4 SD), reduced TmP/GFR (-6.5 SD), and elevated ALP (2.7 SD, each P < .001 vs healthy children) irrespective of age, suggesting active rickets despite prior therapy with oral phosphate and active vitamin D in 88% of patients. Burosumab treatment resulted in comparable increases in serum phosphate and TmP/GFR in children and adolescents with XLH and a steady decline in serum ALP (each P < .001 vs baseline). At 12 months, serum phosphate, TmP/GFR, and ALP levels were within the age-related normal range in approximately 42%, 27%, and 80% of patients in both groups, respectively, with a lower, weight-based final burosumab dose in adolescents compared with children (0.72 vs 1.06 mg/kg, P < .01).

Conclusions

In this real-world setting, 12 months of burosumab treatment was equally effective in normalizing serum ALP in adolescents and children, despite persistent mild hypophosphatemia in one-half of patients, suggesting that complete normalization of serum phosphate is not mandatory for substantial improvement of rickets in these patients. Adolescents appear to require lower weight-based burosumab dosage than children.

### The utility of alkaline phosphatase measurement as a screening test for rickets in breast-fed infants and toddlers: a study from the puget sound pediatric research network [^112MoH6L]. Clinical Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

To determine if alkaline phosphatase (AP) levels are a useful screening test for rickets, the authors measured serum AP levels in children 6 to 15 months old who were predominantly breast-fed for > 6 months without vitamin D supplementation. Radiographs were obtained on children with elevated AP levels to determine the presence of rickets. AP levels were obtained on 246 children; levels were elevated in 33 (13.4%). Rickets was present in 4 of 18 children with elevated levels on whom radiographs were obtained. The sensitivity and specificity of AP levels as a test for rickets was maximal at a cutoff value of 552 U/L. Using this cutoff value, the specificity of AP levels as a test for rickets was 97.4%, and the positive predictive value (PPV) was 40.0%. These results suggest that AP levels may be a useful screening test for rickets in children who are breast-fed for prolonged periods without vitamin D supplementation.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism in pediatric patients… [^112ey2ng]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective. Primary hyperparathyroidism is unusual in children. We reviewed our experience with HPT to better characterize these children. Methods. The retrospective review of patients < 19 years old who underwent parathyroid resection for primary HPT from 1970 to 2000 was performed at a single institution. Results. Fifty-two patients were identified. Median age was 16. 8 years with a female-to-male ratio of 3:
2. Eighty-five percent had an elevated parathyroid hormone level, and 15% had an inappropriately normal PTH level during hypercalcemia. Serum calcium was elevated in all patients except for 2 with multiple endocrine neoplasma -IIA and 1 with familial non-MEN HPT, but both had elevated PTH levels. Alkaline phosphatase levels were significantly higher in children with documented bone involvement.

At presentation 41 patients were symptomatic and end-organ damage occurred in 23 patients. Thirty-four patients had a single adenoma; hyperplasia was identified in 16 patients, and of these cases, 57% occurred in patients diagnosed with MEN-I. Short-term complications included transient hypocalcemia in 29 patients and transient vocal cord paralysis in 2 patients. Long-term complications were significant for permanent hypocalcemia in 2 patients and no recurrent laryngeal nerve injuries. No parathyroid abnormalities were identified during exploration in 4 children. Long-term follow-up was achieved in 98% of patients for a mean and median of 13 years. Resolution of hypercalcemia was achieved in 94% of cases. Conclusion. The diagnosis of primary HPT in pediatric patients is frequently delayed, is commonly symptomatic, and has significant morbidity.

For children in whom HPT is suspected, evaluation of serum calcium and PTH levels is diagnostic in 100% of children. Parathyroid resection is effective at restoring normal serum calcium, has few complications, and is the treatment of choice for children with primary hyperparathyroidism. Comments.

### Hypophosphatasia-aetiology, nosology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment [^111r3KRL]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

Hypophosphatasia is the inborn error of metabolism characterized by low serum alkaline phosphatase activity (hypophosphatasaemia). This biochemical hallmark reflects loss-of-function mutations within the gene that encodes the tissue-nonspecific isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP). TNSALP is a cell-surface homodimeric phosphohydrolase that is richly expressed in the skeleton, liver, kidney and developing teeth. In hypophosphatasia, extracellular accumulation of TNSALP natural substrates includes inorganic pyrophosphate, an inhibitor of mineralization, which explains the dento-osseous and arthritic complications featuring tooth loss, rickets or osteomalacia, and calcific arthopathies. Severely affected infants sometimes also have hypercalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia due to the blocked entry of minerals into the skeleton, and pyridoxine-dependent seizures from insufficient extracellular hydrolysis of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, the major circulating form of vitamin B6, required for neurotransmitter synthesis. Autosomal recessive or dominant inheritance from ~300 predominantly missense ALPL (also known as TNSALP) mutations largely accounts for the remarkably broad-ranging expressivity of hypophosphatasia. High serum concentrations of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate represent a sensitive and specific biochemical marker for hypophosphatasia. Also, phosphoethanolamine levels are usually elevated in serum and urine, though less reliably for diagnosis. TNSALP mutation detection is important for recurrence risk assessment and prenatal diagnosis. Diagnosing paediatric hypophosphatasia is aided by pathognomic radiographic changes when the skeletal disease is severe. Hypophosphatasia was the last type of rickets or osteomalacia to await a medical treatment. Now, significant successes for severely affected paediatric patients are recognized using asfotase alfa, a bone-targeted recombinant TNSALP.

### Monitoring guidance for patients with hypophosphatasia treated with asfotase alfa [^116sUSJP]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis considerations for hypophosphatasia — Diagnosis in patients of any age can be established based on characteristic signs, symptoms, and complications together with consistently low age- and sex-adjusted serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity after excluding other causes of low ALP and skeletal diseases with similar presentations. Because the lower limit of normal for ALP varies by age and sex, measured activity must be compared with the lower limit and range appropriate for the patient. Physicians should be aware that many institutions do not routinely flag low ALP and may incorrectly apply adult ALP reference ranges to all ages, and the report emphasizes that age- and sex-adjusted ALP reference intervals are critical to an accurate diagnosis of HPP.

Results

Study population and demographics

The study included 1,660 individual patients after excluding repeated visits among 2,962 recorded visits. Serum CK levels were measured in 320 patients (19.3% of the total individual patients), with 99 patients (30.9% of those tested) showing elevated CK values. CK elevation was based on a single measurement in all cases. The patients ranged in age from 1 to 235 months, with a median age of 40 months and a mean age of 60 ± 54.3 months. Of the patients, 35 (35.4%) were female, and 64 (64.6%) were male. The demographic and biochemical characteristics of the study population are summarized in Table 1.

Biochemical parameters

The biochemical parameters in the study population had the following distributions. CK levels ranged from 172.0 to 21,362.0 U/L, with a median of 239.0 U/L. AST levels ranged from 22.0 to 391.0 U/L, with a median of 47.0 U/L. ALT levels ranged from 3.0 to 415.0 U/L, with a median of 25.0 U/L. LDH levels ranged from 150.0 to 1,789.0 U/L, with a median of 344.0 U/L. Uric acid levels ranged from 1.7 to 6.9 mg/dL, with a median of 3.5 mg/dL. Potassium levels ranged from 3.1 to 5.8 mmol/L, with a median of 4.1 mmol/L. ALP and GGT levels were also measured but were not included in further correlation analyses due to their limited relevance to muscle pathology.

A significant positive correlation was observed between CK and AST (r = 0.633, p < 0.001), ALT (r = 0.461, p < 0.001), and LDH levels (r = 0.570, p < 0.001). No significant correlation was found between CK and uric acid (r = 0.125, p = 0.218) or ALP (r = − 0.161, p = 0.112) (Table 2).

### Failure to thrive in children with hyperphosphatasia-reply… [^1167MZS3]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

In Reply. — This letter is in response to the letter you received from Dr Goldstein of the Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis. He wrote you regarding my article on "Isoenzyme Studies in Transient Hyperphosphatasemia of Infancy. "1. Dr Goldstein's suggestion was that the marked elevation of alkaline phosphatase may be due to bone resorption and/or liver degeneration secondary to acute severe malnutrition. This seems to be a very unlikely explanation in view of the fact that of the children with this syndrome who have had bone x-ray films, no abnormalities have been noted. In addition, vitamin D studies, although not done very frequently, have yielded normal results. Likewise, in those patients who have had extensive studies of the liver, ie, ultrasound, no abnormalities have been noted. It would seem that if the cause for marked elevation of alkaline phosphatase was bone resorption and liver degeneration secondary to malnutrition, more. KRAUT JR.

### Paediatric-onset autoimmune liver disease: insights from a monocentric experience [^1122xAfk]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Autoimmune liver disease (AILD) encompasses autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis (ASC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). A unified disease process evolving over time through these entities has been recently suggested. From this perspective, this study aimed to compare the characteristics of childhood-onset AILD at baseline and after a medium-to-long term follow-up period.

Methods

Paediatric-onset cases of AILD diagnosed between 1992 and 2023 at a tertiary-care centre were reviewed. Patients transitioned to adult-care by the time of data collection were asked for clinical updates.

Results

Fifty-five patients were included (AIH = 20, ASC = 22, PSC = 13). AIH, ASC and PSC exhibited increasing age at the onset (AIH to PSC, p < 0.01). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) combined with alkaline phosphatase/aspartate aminotransferase (ALP/AST) ratio in predicting sclerosing cholangitis was 0.94, with a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 94%. At the last follow-up (median duration 5,8 years, interquartile range [IQR] 2,9–10,2, n = 45), 15 patients (33%) developed portal hypertension, 2 patients (4%) underwent liver transplantation, no patient died.

Conclusion

A cohort of childhood-onset AILD managed at a single centre reveals a temporal trend in the onset of AIH, ASC and PSC, with progressively older ages. Elevated GGT levels combined with a high ALP/AST ratio predict the diagnosis of sclerosing cholangitis. The occurrence of liver-related adverse events in one-third of patients highlights the progressive nature of paediatric-onset AILD.

### X-linked hypophosphatemia management in children: an international working group clinical practice guideline [^113RW12r]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

How to Treat?

TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS* (GRADEd)

In children 12 months of age and older with XLH, we recommend burosumab therapy over conventional therapy (active vitamin D and phosphate salts) (strong recommendation, moderate certainty).
In children 6–12 months of age with XLH, we suggest burosumab therapy over conventional therapy (active vitamin D and phosphate salts) (conditional recommendation, low certainty).

* We recognize that there may be limitations to drug therapy accessibility

TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS (NON-GRADEd)

The panel proposes

Commence medical therapy promptly upon confirming XLH diagnosis and hypophosphatemia to optimize outcomes.
Treatment is directed at improving radiographic, biochemical and clinical signs of rickets (serum ALP, total or bone-specific), lower limb deformity, physical function, and the optimization of growth by addressing the mineral metabolism abnormalities of XLH.
When treating with burosumab, adhere to the recommended starting dose and adjust doses to achieve serum phosphorus levels in the low- to mid-normal (peak) or just below the normal or low-normal (trough) range for age, while avoiding hyperphosphatemia at any point in the dose cycle.
Optimal management with burosumab entails dose adjustments based on optimizing serum phosphorus levels for age rather than solely based on weight increases to avoid increasing the risk of hyperphosphatemia.
If burosumab is not available, children should be treated with conventional therapy (active vitamin D, usually combined with phosphate salts). Conventional therapy is advised over no treatment.
Active vitamin D can be administered with or without phosphate salts, but phosphate salts should not be used as monotherapy.
When treating with conventional therapy (active vitamin D with or without phosphate salts), avoid targeting normal fasting serum phosphorus levels to prevent phosphate overdosing or toxicity.
Adjust active vitamin D and oral phosphate therapy with the aim to lower, and to normalize alkaline phosphatase activity, if this can be safely achieved, and promote normal linear growth. However, phosphate doses exceeding 60 mg elemental phosphorus/kg/day are rarely well-tolerated. The active vitamin D dose should be decreased in the presence of persistent hypercalciuria. However, unbalanced increases in the phosphate doses without raising active vitamin D doses increases the risk of sustained hyperparathyroidism.
Consider decreasing the phosphate dose or increasing the active vitamin D dose (the latter, in the absence of hypercalciuria/hypercalcemia) if PTH levels are consistently elevated, as phosphate stimulates PTH secretion and calcitriol can suppress PTH.
The routine use of recombinant human growth hormone for children with XLH and short stature is not advised due to limited benefit noted in randomized clinical trials.
Early involvement of orthopedic surgery is crucial to assess for the necessity, and the timing of, any corrective procedures.
In tertiary hyperparathyroidism, multigland involvement is expected. Calcimimetics (ie, cinacalcet) can be used on an off-label basis to decrease PTH level in the setting of hypercalcemic hyperparathyroidism, while ensuring close monitoring of serum calcium in order to avoid hypocalcemia. If hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia cannot be controlled, subtotal parathyroidectomy should be considered.
Burosumab is contraindicated in chronic kidney disease (eGFR < 30 mL/min), and in acute kidney injury. Cautious use is advised if eGFR is between 30 and 60 mL/min with careful monitoring for hyperphosphatemia and changes in eGFR.
If clinic blood pressure measures consistently exceed the 95th percentile (for age and height) confirmation with 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring or serial home blood pressure measurements is indicated. Treatment should follow current pediatric hypertension recommendations.

### A multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of Wilson disease: 2022 practice guidance on Wilson disease from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^114i1ouT]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Biochemical liver tests — patterns in Wilson disease include that serum aminotransferase activities are generally abnormal except at a very early age (infancy), and the elevation may be relatively mild and disproportionate to the severity of liver disease. In patients with cirrhosis, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is often elevated at levels above alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Transient hyperbilirubinemia, mainly unconjugated, may occur with brief self-limited episodes of hemolysis. Low-normal or subnormal serum alkaline phosphatase is typical of Wilson disease associated with intravascular hemolysis; it is also found with severe disease not meeting criteria for ALF (acute liver injury [ALI] without hepatic encephalopathy) and may be associated with episodic hemolysis.

Elevations in Liver Enzyme Tests

Moderate (less than 3xULN) elevations of serum transaminases have been reported with use of ZOCOR.

Persistent increases to more than 3xULN in serum transaminases have occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ZOCOR in clinical studies. Marked persistent increases of hepatic transaminases have occurred with ZOCOR. Elevated alkaline phosphatase and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase have also been reported.

In Study 4S, with a median follow-up of 5.4 years, 1,986 adult patients were treated with ZOCOR 20 mg once daily, of whom 37% titrated to 40 mg once daily. The percentage of patients with one or more occurrences of transaminase elevations to > 3xULN was 0.7% in patients taking ZOCOR compared with 0.6% in patients taking placebo. Elevated transaminases leading to discontinuation of study treatment occurred in 0.4% of patients taking ZOCOR and 0.2% of patients taking placebo. The majority of elevated transaminases leading to treatment discontinuation occurred within in the first year.

For asymptomatic and well-appearing children with a single elevated screening ALT, a repeat measurement is recommended within 3 months to exclude transient conditions, and we recommend further evaluation and/or referral to pediatric gastroenterology or hepatology if liver enzymes remain persistently elevated or if there are concerning signs or symptoms for severe liver disease.

### Fulminant Wilson's disease in children: appraisal of a critical diagnosis [^115bKLtw]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To characterize fulminant Wilson's disease in children, outline clinical and biochemical differences to fulminant hepatic failure of other etiologies, and compare sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing fulminant Wilson's disease of alkaline phosphatase to total bilirubin ratio and aspartate aminotransferase to alanine aminotransferase ratio.

Design

Retrospective case study.

Setting

Twenty-two-bed multidisciplinary pediatric intensive care unit in a tertiary university hospital, national referral center for pediatric liver transplantation.

Patients

Between March 1986 and December 1999, seven children, aged between nine and 16 yrs, were admitted in our unit for fulminant Wilson's disease. During the same period of time, aged-matched analysis identified 12 other children with fulminant hepatic failure of other etiologies.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

On admission, pediatric risk of mortality score, coagulation variables, and hepatic encephalopathy grade were similar in both groups. Children with fulminant Wilson's disease (n = 7) were characterized by lowered hemoglobin and serum transaminases, elevated serum bilirubin, and the occurrence of Kayser-Fleischer rings. Although some admission variables were significantly different between both groups, the elevated variability did not allow us to define acceptable cutoff values. Receiver operating characteristics curve for alkaline phosphatase to total bilirubin ratio showed a good discriminative power (Az = 0.87) in differentiating fulminant Wilson's disease from fulminant hepatic failure of other causes, and a ratio < 1 showed a 86% sensitivity and 50% specificity (odds ratio, 6; 95% confidence interval, 66–0.5; p = .173) for fulminant Wilson's disease diagnosis.

Conclusions

Although requiring prospective study to confirm, Kayser-Fleischer rings and serum alkaline phosphatase to total bilirubin ratio may assist in the early diagnosis of fulminant Wilson's disease.

Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2019). High credibility.

Cholestatic liver disease — interpretation of nutritional biomarkers and vitamins emphasizes that Vitamin K deficiency (VKD) should be considered in the differential diagnosis of metabolic bone disease in cholestatic patients, even in those with a normal INR, and that Plasma PIVKA-II (protein induced in vitamin K absence) levels may assist in determining VKD; however, this assay is not widely available in the clinical setting. For vitamin D deficiency (VDD), If VDD is suspected, further work-up including measurement of serum parathyroid hormone, calcium, and phosphate levels may be indicated. For zinc status, Zinc circulates bound to albumin; therefore, low serum albumin and zinc levels are used to screen for deficiency, which may be associated with hair loss and skin desquamation, and since zinc is required for alkaline phosphatase synthesis, low alkaline phosphatase levels may be suggestive of zinc deficiency; however, Alkaline phosphatase levels should, however, be interpreted with caution in patients with cholestasis and/or bone disease, which cause elevations in this biomarker. A directive on this page states that Clinicians should familiarize themselves with the limitations of nutritional biomarkers in the context of chronic liver disease.

### Prevalence and prognostic value of abnormal liver test results in critically ill children and the impact of delaying parenteral nutrition [^1141okCd]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

In the Early versus Late Parenteral Nutrition in the Pediatric ICU randomized controlled trial, delaying parenteral nutrition to beyond day 7 (late parenteral nutrition) was clinically superior to supplemental parenteral nutrition initiated within 24 hours (early parenteral nutrition), but resulted in a higher rise in bilirubin. We aimed to document prevalence and prognostic value of abnormal liver tests in the PICU and the impact hereon of withholding early parenteral nutrition.

Design

Preplanned secondary analysis of the Early versus Late Parenteral Nutrition in the Pediatric ICU randomized controlled trial. Total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, alkaline phosphatase plasma concentrations were measured systematically in PICU. Liver test analyses were adjusted for baseline characteristics including severity of illness.

Setting

Three PICUs in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Canada.

Patients

As neonatal jaundice was considered a confounder, only the 1,231 of the 1,440 Early versus Late Parenteral Nutrition in the Pediatric ICU-patients 28 days to 17 years old were included.

Interventions

Late parenteral nutrition as compared with early parenteral nutrition.

Measurements and Main Results

During the first seven PICU days, the prevalence of cholestasis (> 2mg/dL [34.2 μmol/L] bilirubin) ranged between 3.8% and 4.9% and of hypoxic hepatitis (≥ 20-fold upper limit of normality for alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase) between 0.8% and 2.2%, both unaffected by the use of parenteral nutrition. Throughout the first week in PICU plasma bilirubin concentrations were higher in late parenteral nutrition patients (p < 0.05), but became comparable to early parenteral nutrition patients as soon as parenteral nutrition was started on day 8. Plasma concentrations of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase were unaffected by parenteral nutrition. High day 1 plasma concentrations of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase (p ≤ 0.01), but not alkaline phosphatase, were independent risk factors for PICU mortality. Day 1 plasma bilirubin concentrations displayed a U-shaped association with PICU mortality, with higher mortality associated with bilirubin less than 0.20mg/dL and greater than 0.76mg/dL (< 3.42 μmol/L and > 13 μmol/L) (p ≤ 0.01).

Conclusions

Overt cholestasis and hypoxic hepatitis were rare and unrelated to the nutritional strategy. However, withholding parenteral nutrition up to 1 week in PICU increased plasma bilirubin. A mild elevation of bilirubin on the first PICU day was associated with lower risk of death and may reflect a stress response, rather than true cholestasis.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^1155asMt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — abnormal liver chemistries evaluation and interpretation states that serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are the most common liver chemistries; hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT compared with alkaline phosphatase, whereas cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase as compared with AST and ALT. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33 IU/l for males, 19 to 25 IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. Evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C; assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease; screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency; and a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be pursued. Total bilirubin elevation can occur from hepatocellular or cholestatic diseases; elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

Figure 4 — Algorithm for evaluation of elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) delineates two branches. Under "Normal total bilirubin and serum transaminases", proceed with "History and physical exam confirm with serum GGT"; if "GGT normal → evaluate for non-hepatobiliary etiologies", but if "GGT abnormal → obtain right upper quadrant ultrasound, evaluate for potential hepatotoxic medications, check AMA, ANA, and SMA". If the evaluation is negative, then "If evaluation negative and alkaline phosphatase > 2x ULN → consider liver biopsy" or "If evaluation negative and alkaline phosphatase 1–2x ULN → consider observation", and "If AMA positive → evaluate for primary biliary cirrhosis/cholangitis", with persistence prompting "If persistent elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase after 6 months observation → consider liver biopsy". Under "Elevated serum transaminases ± elevated bilirubin", perform "History and physical exam Check right upper quadrant ultrasound"; if "If ductal dilatation → ERCP, MRCP" and if "If no ductal dilatation → check AMA, ANA, SMA". Next, "If AMA positive → evaluate for primary biliary cirrhosis/cholangitis", whereas "If AMA negative and alkaline phosphatase > 2x ULN → consider liver biopsy or MRCP" or "If AMA negative and alkaline phosphatase 1–2x ULN → consider observation", and persistent elevation leads to "If persistent elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase after 6 months observation → consider liver biopsy or MRCP".

### Clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of X-linked hypophosphataemia [^116qZb7b]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for X-linked hypophosphatemia, more specifically with respect to vitamin D and phosphate salts (children), XLH-EG 2025 guidelines recommend to administer phosphate supplements as frequently as possible, for example, 4–6 times daily, in young patients with high ALP levels. Reduce the frequency to 3–4 times daily when ALP has normalized.

### X-linked hypophosphatemia management in children: an international working group clinical practice guideline [^115b3Aaz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) is a rare, inherited disorder primarily affecting the skeleton and teeth in children. XLH is caused by pathogenic loss-of-function variants in the phosphate-regulating endopeptidase homolog, X-linked (PHEX) gene, leading to increased fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and chronic hypophosphatemia secondary to renal phosphate wasting. This manifests as impaired bone mineralization and skeletal deformities in affected children. Loss of PHEX protein may also have direct effects on skeletal integrity outside of its effect on FGF23, phosphate, and activated vitamin D, which are currently under study. Other biochemical findings in children may include elevated levels of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), although adults with XLH may have normal serum ALP despite frank hypophosphatemia and active osteomalacia.

While dental infections are common in both children and adults with XLH, other disease comorbidities such as enthesopathy, arthritis, and spinal stenosis primarily manifest in adulthood. This manuscript summarizes current evidence as well as recommendations based on an expert clinical practice survey regarding diagnosis and management of XLH in children. We also provide additional details regarding the features of XLH in children that are important in confirming the diagnosis and in the, monitoring and management of XLH.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^113sUr3o]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency in children — screening advises that pediatricians "should have a low threshold for screening for vitamin D deficiency" in the presence of nonspecific symptoms, in dark-skinned infants at higher latitudes in winter and spring, in children on anticonvulsants or chronic glucocorticoids, and in those with malabsorption-related diseases; "Another possible group to consider screening" is children with frequent fractures and low bone mineral density. A practical tool is "serum ALP, which if elevated for age should be followed with measurements of serum 25(OH)-D, calcium, phosphorus, and PTH", along with "radiologic examination of the distal ends of (1) the radius and ulna (wrist anteroposterior view) or (2) tibia and femur (knee anteroposterior view)"; reference ranges note "ALP levels are usually < 500 IU/L in neonates and < 1000 IU/L in children up to 9 years of age", and "the wrist radiograph may be the most reliable test for detecting subclinical rickets".

### Patient-derived reference intervals for alkaline phosphatase to support appropriate utility for isoenzymes determinations and hypophosphatasia [^1164DS7j]. Laboratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Appropriate age- and sex-specific reference intervals for alkaline phosphatase (ALP) are essential to identify patients with hypophosphatasia (low ALP) and to avoid unnecessary ALP isoenzymes analysis (elevated ALP). This study used patient ALP historical data to statistically derive sex- and age-specific reference intervals.

Methods

The ALP values reported as part of clinical management during an 18 month period (from July 2021 to March 2023) were obtained. Following logarithmic transformation of ALP data and repeated removal of outliers, cumulative frequency plots were generated using a modified Hoffmann approach to derive age- and sex-specific reference intervals.

Results

Age-specific ALP reference intervals ranged from 110 to 250 and 120 to 295 U/L for males and females < 15 days old, 80 to 400 and 90 to 380 U/L for males and females 15 days to 1 year old, 105 to 280 and 90 to 290 U/L for males and females 1 to 10 years old, 75 to 300 and 90 to 300 U/L for males and females 10 to 13 years old, 80 to 300 and 60 to 175 U/L for males and females 13 to 15 years old, 55 to 150 and 60 to 180 U/L for males and females 15 to 18 years old, and 55 to 140 and 60 to 147 U/L for male and female adults, respectively (> 18 years old).

Conclusion

By applying derived ranges, a retrospective review of ALP isoenzymes would eliminate 24.5% of requests. Additionally, 9 neonates would have required investigation for possible hypophosphatasia.

### Edetate calcium disodium [^112Sbt5W]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General Precautions

Edetate calcium disodium may produce the same renal damage as lead poisoning, such as proteinuria and microscopic hematuria. Treatment-induced nephrotoxicity is dose-dependent and may be reduced by assuring adequate diuresis before therapy begins. Urine flow must be monitored throughout therapy which must be stopped if anuria or severe oliguria develop. The proximal tubule hydropic degeneration usually recovers upon cessation of therapy. Edetate calcium disodium must be used in reduced doses in patients with pre-existing mild renal disease. Patients should be monitored for cardiac rhythm irregularities and other ECG changes during intravenous therapy.

Information for patients

Patients should be instructed to immediately inform their physician if urine output stops for a period of 12 hours.

Laboratory tests

Urinalysis and urine sediment, renal and hepatic function and serum electrolyte levels should be checked before each course of therapy and then be monitored daily during therapy in severe cases, and in less serious cases after the second and fifth day of therapy. Therapy must be discontinued at the first sign of renal toxicity. The presence of large renal epithelial cells or increasing number of red blood cells in urinary sediment or greater proteinuria call for immediate stopping of edetate calcium disodium administration. Alkaline phosphatase values are frequently depressed (possibly due to decreased serum zinc levels), but return to normal within 48 hours after cessation of therapy. Elevated erythrocyte protoporphyrin levels (> 35 mcg/dL of whole blood) indicate the need to perform a venous blood lead determination. If the whole blood lead concentration is between 25 to 55 mcg/dL a mobilization test can be considered (see Diagnostic Test).7,8An elevation of urinary coproporphyrin (adults: > 250 mcg/day; pediatric patients under 80 lbs: > 75 mcg/day) and elevation of urinary delta aminolevulinic acid (ALA) (adults: > 4 mg/day; pediatric patients: > 3 mg/m2/day) are associated with blood lead levels > 40 mcg/dL. Urinary coproporphyrin may be falsely negative in terminal patients and in severely iron-depleted pediatric patients who are not regenerating heme.9In growing pediatric patients long bone x-rays showing lead lines and abdominal x-rays showing radio-opaque material in the abdomen may be of help in estimating the level of exposure to lead.
