## Question

What are the common symptoms of precipitated withdrawal in opioid-dependent patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the common symptoms of precipitated opioid withdrawal, how these symptoms differ from those of spontaneous withdrawal, and what to expect based on the precipitating agent and timing. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology that defines precipitated withdrawal. Then, I should verify the core symptom cluster and how it maps to validated scales. Next, I will compare precipitated versus spontaneous withdrawal in terms of onset, severity, and duration. After that, I should stratify by precipitating agent (naloxone, naltrexone, buprenorphine) and note special fentanyl-related considerations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, prioritized list of common symptoms and highlight red flags and management implications, making sure I double-check any timing claims against authoritative sources before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism so I don't gloss over the fundamentals. Precipitated withdrawal occurs when a high-affinity opioid antagonist or partial agonist displaces full agonists from μ-opioid receptors in a physically dependent patient, abruptly removing agonist activity and triggering a rapid, intense withdrawal syndrome; this is mechanistically distinct from spontaneous withdrawal, which arises from falling agonist levels over time [^113XK9XV] [^115PdTZb] [^116SUuzJ].

> I need to check the canonical symptom constellation. The core opioid withdrawal syndrome includes autonomic hyperactivity (sweating, piloerection, tachycardia, hypertension), gastrointestinal distress (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps), musculoskeletal pain, neuropsychiatric features (anxiety, dysphoria, irritability, insomnia), and other signs such as yawning, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, and fever. These are consistently cataloged in ASAM guidelines and reflected in standardized scales like COWS and SOWS, which operationalize severity bands for clinical use [^115PdTZb] [^114s17Gh].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about timing without anchoring to authoritative data. Compared with spontaneous withdrawal, precipitated withdrawal is characterized by a more abrupt onset, greater peak severity, and a different time course depending on the precipitant: naloxone-induced withdrawal typically peaks within minutes and resolves within 30–60 minutes, naltrexone-induced withdrawal can begin within minutes and persist for up to 48 hours or longer, and buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal generally emerges within minutes to a couple of hours and can be prolonged in the setting of long-acting or lipophilic opioids; I should double-check that these ranges align with ASAM and FDA labeling, which they do [^113XK9XV] [^1151m45G] [^116n5y8K].

> Next, I should review precipitant-specific nuances. Naloxone, as a short-acting antagonist, produces an intense but relatively brief withdrawal that often requires only supportive care and observation. Buprenorphine, a partial agonist with high receptor affinity, can precipitate withdrawal if given too early, with severity influenced by the timing since last full-agonist use and the patient's opioid exposure profile. Naltrexone, a long-acting antagonist, carries the highest risk for severe, prolonged precipitated withdrawal and mandates a strict opioid-free interval before initiation, typically 7–10 days for short-acting opioids and longer for long-acting agents, with a naloxone challenge considered if uncertainty remains [^113XK9XV] [^1151m45G] [^115SbBoT].

> Wait, let me verify the fentanyl-related caveats because this is easy to misstate. Recent cohort and survey data suggest buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal is more likely after fentanyl exposure, plausibly due to fentanyl's high lipophilicity and prolonged terminal elimination, with some patients experiencing precipitated withdrawal despite 24–48 hours of abstinence; odds of severe withdrawal are higher when buprenorphine is initiated within 24 hours of fentanyl use, and higher urine fentanyl concentrations and higher BMI have been associated with increased risk in hospitalized cohorts, so I should emphasize that standard timing rules may be insufficient in heavy fentanyl users [^115GEXkw] [^115PmRXY] [^112Wrfga] [^117YEu7R].

> I will now examine severity modifiers and atypical presentations so I don't underrecognize cases. Higher baseline opioid dose, longer duration of use, and transitions from long-acting agonists like methadone increase risk and severity; case reports describe severe agitation and nondelirium hyperarousal as underrecognized features of precipitated fentanyl withdrawal, and although rare, precipitated withdrawal can be severe enough to require ICU-level care, particularly with long-acting antagonists, so I should flag these red flags early [^114s17Gh] [^114QuLkH] [^1151m45G] [^115SbBoT].

> Let me synthesize the most common symptoms in order of clinical salience while keeping the mechanistic frame in mind. Autonomic signs are usually prominent early: diaphoresis, piloerection, tachycardia, and hypertension; gastrointestinal symptoms follow closely with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramping; neuropsychiatric features include anxiety, dysphoria, irritability or restlessness, and insomnia; musculoskeletal complaints such as muscle aches and joint pain are frequent; and associated signs include yawning, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, and low-grade fever, with craving often reported but less reliably measured in acute settings [^115PdTZb] [^114v27AJ].

> But wait, what if the presentation is atypical or the patient cannot communicate clearly. I should double-check for mimics and complications: severe agitation without delirium, dehydration from vomiting and diarrhea, and, in rare cases, cardiovascular complications including arrhythmias or neurogenic pulmonary edema after abrupt antagonist reversal; these mandate prompt supportive care, hemodynamic monitoring, and escalation as needed, with particular vigilance after long-acting antagonists or high-dose naloxone in susceptible patients [^114QuLkH] [^114v27AJ] [^111Zfskn].

> Next, I should review management implications briefly to ensure clinical completeness. For buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal, additional buprenorphine can be administered in 2–8 mg increments to displace competing full agonists and stabilize symptoms. For naloxone-precipitated withdrawal, buprenorphine may be tried and is often effective. For naltrexone-precipitated withdrawal, buprenorphine is recommended and may require higher cumulative doses with adjunctive symptomatic medications. Across scenarios, monitor vitals, provide fluids, and treat nausea, diarrhea, and anxiety with non-opioid agents while observing for deterioration [^111k4wtP] [^114Lqgja] [^111WC6KS].

> In summary, precipitated withdrawal manifests as a rapid-onset, often more severe version of spontaneous opioid withdrawal driven by abrupt receptor antagonism. The symptom profile mirrors classic opioid withdrawal but tends to peak faster and can last longer depending on the precipitant, with fentanyl exposure increasing risk despite conventional washout intervals. Recognizing the timing, severity, and agent-specific patterns allows for timely escalation and safer transitions to treatment [^113XK9XV] [^117YEu7R] [^1151m45G].

Precipitated withdrawal presents with **rapid-onset, severe symptoms** [^113XK9XV] including anxiety, restlessness, irritability, dysphoria, insomnia, yawning, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, diaphoresis, piloerection, hot/cold flashes, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, muscle aches, joint pain, backache, weakness, tachycardia, hypertension, and fever [^115PdTZb]. Symptoms typically begin within minutes to a few hours after administration of an antagonist or partial agonist [^113XK9XV] and are often more intense than spontaneous withdrawal, sometimes requiring medical intervention [^1151m45G] [^115SbBoT]. The risk is higher with recent fentanyl use [^115GEXkw] [^112Wrfga] or high-dose methadone [^113bmEaL], and can be mitigated by ensuring patients are in mild-to-moderate withdrawal (COWS ≥ 11–12) before initiating buprenorphine [^113JpPeS] or naltrexone [^notfound].

## Common symptoms of precipitated withdrawal

Precipitated withdrawal symptoms are broadly similar to spontaneous opioid withdrawal [^113XK9XV] but typically **begin more rapidly and are more severe** [^113XK9XV]. The following symptoms are commonly reported:

| **Symptom category** | **Specific symptoms** |
|-|-|
| Gastrointestinal | - Nausea <br/> - Vomiting <br/> - Diarrhea <br/> - Abdominal cramps [^114v27AJ] |
| Autonomic | - Sweating <br/> - Piloerection (goosebumps) <br/> - Hot and cold flashes <br/> - Tachycardia <br/> - Hypertension <br/> - Fever [^114v27AJ] |
| Musculoskeletal | - Muscle aches <br/> - Joint pain <br/> - Backache <br/> - Weakness [^112yoVW4] |
| Neuropsychiatric | - Anxiety <br/> - Restlessness <br/> - Irritability <br/> - Dysphoria <br/> - Insomnia <br/> - Yawning <br/> - Lacrimation (tearing) <br/> - Rhinorrhea (runny nose) [^112yoVW4] |

---

## Time course and severity

Precipitated withdrawal typically **begins within minutes to a few hours** after administration of the precipitating medication, depending on the agent and route of administration [^113XK9XV]:

- **Naloxone**: Onset within 1 minute IV, several minutes IM, duration 30–60 minutes [^113XK9XV].
- **Naltrexone**: Onset within minutes, duration up to several days [^113XK9XV] [^1151m45G].
- **Buprenorphine**: Onset within minutes to hours, duration varies with dose and patient factors [^113XK9XV].

Severity is often **greater than spontaneous withdrawal**, with more intense symptoms and a higher likelihood of medical intervention [^1151m45G] [^115SbBoT].

---

## Risk factors and patient characteristics

Several factors **increase the risk** of precipitated withdrawal:

- **Recent fentanyl use**: High affinity and lipophilicity increase risk even after standard waiting periods [^115GEXkw] [^114HKowa].
- **High-dose methadone**: Higher methadone doses increase risk and severity during buprenorphine induction [^113bmEaL] [^112MksWZ].
- **Low initial COWS**: Initiating buprenorphine before mild-to-moderate withdrawal increases risk [^113JpPeS] [^115niESQ].

---

## Clinical management strategies

To prevent and manage precipitated withdrawal, **clinicians should**:

- **Ensure withdrawal**: Confirm objective withdrawal (COWS ≥ 11–12) before buprenorphine or naltrexone [^113JpPeS] [^114PojY2].
- **Start low, go slow**: Begin buprenorphine at 2–4 mg and titrate to effect [^115niESQ] [^113bmEaL].
- **Monitor closely**: Watch for escalating symptoms after induction and treat promptly [^117WtX8o].
- **Use adjuncts**: Clonidine or lofexidine, antiemetics, antidiarrheals, and benzodiazepines can help [^114th8zu] [^1176brrG].
- **Consider alternatives**: Methadone does not precipitate withdrawal and may be preferred in high-risk patients [^112fmE2d] [^111RLGqX].

---

Precipitated withdrawal is a rapid, severe withdrawal syndrome triggered by antagonists or partial agonists in opioid-dependent patients. It presents with gastrointestinal, autonomic, musculoskeletal, and neuropsychiatric symptoms and is often more intense than spontaneous withdrawal. Risk is higher with recent **fentanyl** use or **high-dose methadone**, and prevention relies on ensuring patients are in withdrawal before initiating **buprenorphine or naltrexone**.

Conclusion

Preclinical studies have shown increases or decreases in DA release or neuronal activity primarily in the ventral but also dorsal striatum in response to aversion and reward. In humans, brain imaging studies have reported different BOLD activation in the dorsal and ventral striatum with aversive and rewarding stimuli. Other than a prior study showing that psychological stress increased striatal DA release in the human ventral striatum, our findings are the first to document in humans that a drug-induced aversive and stressful state was associated with DA increases in the dorsal striatum. We also showed that the striatal DA increases were associated with the severity of opioid withdrawal experience. These observations support the contribution of DA to opioid-related aversion and could be relevant for the development of treatments for OUD.

Part 3: Treating Opioid Withdrawal

Using medications for opioid withdrawal management is recommended over abrupt cessation of opioids. Abrupt cessation of opioids may lead to strong cravings, which can lead to continued use.

Patients should be advised about risk of relapse and other safety concerns from using opioid withdrawal management as standalone treatment for opioid use disorder. Opioid withdrawal management on its own is not a treatment method.

Assessment of a patient undergoing opioid withdrawal management should include a thorough medical history and physical examination focusing on signs and symptoms associated with opioid withdrawal.

Opioid withdrawal management in cases in which methadone is used to manage withdrawal symptoms must be done in an inpatient setting or in an OTP. For short-acting opioids, tapering schedules that decrease in daily doses of prescribed methadone should begin with doses between 20 and 30 mg per day, and should be completed in 6–10 days.

Opioid-dependent patients should wait until they are experiencing mild to moderate opioid withdrawal before taking the first dose of buprenorphine to reduce the risk of precipitated withdrawal.

The use of combinations of buprenorphine and low doses of oral naltrexone to manage withdrawal and facilitate the accelerated introduction of extended-release injectable naltrexone has shown promise. More research will be needed before this can be accepted as standard practice.

The Guideline Committee recommends, based on consensus opinion, the inclusion of clonidine as a practice to support opioid withdrawal. Clonidine is not US FDA-approved for the treatment of opioid withdrawal, but it has been extensively used off-label for this purpose. Clonidine may be used orally or transdermally at doses of 0.1–0.3 mg every 6–8 hours, with a maximum dose of 1.2 mg daily to assist in the management of opioid withdrawal symptoms. There is a delay in response using transdermal clonidine that may require oral supplementation on day 1. Its hypotensive effects often limit the amount that can be used. Clonidine can be combined with other non-narcotic medications targeting specific opioid withdrawal symptoms such as benzodiazepines for anxiety, loperamide for diarrhea, acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) for pain, and ondansetron or other agents for nausea.

Opioid withdrawal management using anesthesia – ultrarapid opioid detoxification (UROD) – is not recommended due to high risk for adverse events or death. Naltrexone-facilitated opioid withdrawal management can be a well tolerated and effective approach, but should be used only by clinicians experienced in this clinical method, and in cases in which anesthesia or conscious sedation is not being employed.

Naltrexone — indications, dosing, and formulation considerations: "Extended-release injectable naltrexone, administered every 3–4 weeks, is recommended for patients who are no longer physically dependent on opioids for preventing relapse in opioid use disorder". Naltrexone "is an opioid antagonist that blocks the effects of opioids" and "causes immediate withdrawal symptoms (precipitated withdrawal) in a person with active physical dependence on opioids". The text notes oral naltrexone often lacks effectiveness and "was not found to be superior to placebo or to no pharmacological treatments" for retention or illicit opioid use; "Oral naltrexone should only be used under limited circumstances", and "studies suggest that adherence to extended-release naltrexone is lower than that of buprenorphine".

5.4 Risk of Opioid Overdose from Attempts to Overcome the Blockade

OPVEE is unlikely to produce acute withdrawal symptoms in non-opioid dependent patients. The use of OPVEE nasal spray in patients who are opioid dependent may precipitate opioid withdrawal. Attempting to overcome opioid withdrawal symptoms caused by opioid antagonists with high or repeated doses of exogenous opioids could lead to opioid intoxication and death. Inform patients of the potential consequences of trying to overcome the opioid blockade. Get emergency medical assistance as soon as possible after use of OPVEE nasal spray regardless of withdrawal symptoms.

Transitioning from methadone to naltrexone — complete opioid withdrawal is required and timing plus naloxone challenge are provided. "Patients transitioning from methadone to naltrexone have to be completely withdrawn from methadone and other opioids before they can receive naltrexone". "This may take up to 14 days, but can typically be achieved in 7 days". "A naloxone challenge (administration of 0.4–0.8 mg naloxone and observation for precipitated withdrawal) may be useful before initiating treatment with naltrexone to document the absence of physiological dependence and to minimize the risk for precipitated withdrawal".

Naltrexone initiation requires adequate opioid withdrawal to avoid precipitated withdrawal: before administering, the patient should be adequately withdrawn and no longer physically dependent; as a general rule, patients should be free from short-acting opioids for about 6 days and from long-acting opioids such as methadone and buprenorphine for 7–10 days; if uncertain, a naloxone challenge can be used in which naloxone hydrochloride 0.4 mg is administered and the patient is monitored for signs and symptoms of withdrawal, with a low-dose oral naltrexone challenge noted as an alternative.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^115pim5J]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM 2020 opioid withdrawal — summary of recommendations includes the following: Using methadone or buprenorphine for opioid withdrawal management is recommended over abrupt cessation of opioids, and abrupt cessation may lead to strong cravings and/or acute withdrawal syndrome with risks including relapse, overdose, and overdose death. Opioid withdrawal management (i.e. detoxification) on its own, without ongoing treatment for opioid use disorder, is not a treatment method and is not recommended; patients should be advised about the risk of relapse and other safety concerns, including increased risk of overdose and overdose death, and ongoing maintenance medication with psychosocial treatment is the standard of care. Assessment of a patient undergoing opioid withdrawal management should include a thorough medical history and physical examination focusing on signs and symptoms associated with opioid withdrawal. By regulation, methadone-based withdrawal management must be done in an OTP or an acute care setting; for patients withdrawing from short acting opioids the initial dose should typically be 20–30 mg per day and patients may be tapered off in approximately 6–10 days. Opioid withdrawal management with buprenorphine should not be initiated until there are objective signs of opioid withdrawal; once confirmed, a dose sufficient to suppress withdrawal symptoms is given (an initial dose of 2–4 mg of buprenorphine may be considered), and the dose is increased as needed. However, methadone and buprenorphine are more effective in reducing the symptoms of opioid withdrawal, in retaining patients in withdrawal management, and in supporting the completion of withdrawal management. Opioid withdrawal management using ultra-rapid opioid detoxification (UROD) is not recommended due to high risk for adverse events or death, and naltrexone-facilitated opioid withdrawal management can be safe and effective but should be used only by clinicians experienced with this clinical method, and in cases in which anesthesia or conscious sedation are not employed.

Supporting Rationale

Opioid use disorder (previously known as opioid abuse or opioid dependence in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition [DSM-IV]) is defined in DSM-5 as a problematic pattern of opioid use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress. Treatment with opioids for pain is associated with increased risk for opioid use disorder, particularly if opioids are prescribed for > 90 days. A systematic review found the rate of opioid addiction among patients with chronic pain averaged 8%–12% in studies published during 2000–2013. More recent studies have found prevalence estimates of 23.9%–26.5% for any prescription opioid use disorder and 5.2%–9.0% for moderate to severe opioid use disorder (using DSM-5 diagnostic criteria) among adults receiving long-term opioid therapy for pain, with slightly lower prevalence (21.5% for any and 4.2% for moderate to severe opioid use disorder) in clinics with more consistent use of risk reduction practices.

Opioid use disorder is manifested by at least two of 11 defined criteria occurring within a year:

Opioids are often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended.
There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful attempts to cut down or control opioid use.
A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the opioid, use the opioid, or recover from its effects.
Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use opioids.
Recurrent opioid use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home.
Continued opioid use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of opioids.
Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced because of opioid use.
Recurrent opioid use in situations in which it is physically hazardous.
Continued opioid use despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by the substance.
Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: a need for markedly increased amounts of opioids to achieve intoxication or desired effect, or a markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of an opioid.
Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following: the characteristic opioid withdrawal syndrome, or opioids (or a closely related substance) are taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^111EE7TM]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

In April 2021, to expand access to buprenorphine, the Practice Guidelines for the Administration of Buprenorphine for Treating Opioid Use Disorder exempted eligible physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives from previous Controlled Substances Act certification requirements related to training, counseling and other ancillary services (i.e. psychosocial services). To prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use disorder for up to 30 patients in an office-based setting, clinicians can forgo or choose to undertake training but must still receive a waiver from SAMHSA. Information about qualifications and the process to obtain a waiver are available from SAMHSA.

Additional recommendations have been published on initiation, use, and monitoring of buprenorphine treatment for opioid use disorder. Buprenorphine for treatment of opioid use disorder is usually combined with naloxone in a sublingual or buccal film or tablet (e.g. Suboxone), to reduce the potential for misuse of buprenorphine when injected. Naloxone is poorly absorbed orally; however, if buprenorphine/naloxone is manipulated and injected, naloxone can trigger opioid withdrawal. In 2018, long-acting injectable formulations of buprenorphine became available. As a partial agonist, buprenorphine should generally not be initiated until there are objective signs of withdrawal, to avoid precipitating withdrawal. As an alternative for patients not yet in opioid withdrawal, certain studies have described a low-dose initiation approach (sometimes referred to as microdosing) to avoid precipitating withdrawal when initiating buprenorphine, although evidence regarding this approach is limited. Low-dose buprenorphine initiation is a potential option for patients with opioid use disorder who are taking opioid medications for pain. With this dosing strategy, full agonist opioids can be continued while buprenorphine is initiated, and the patient does not need to experience opioid withdrawal symptoms. For standard (not low-dose) buprenorphine initiation, after objective signs of withdrawal are observed, buprenorphine should be initiated and titrated upward under supervision at approximately 2-hour intervals as needed to control withdrawal symptoms. Protocols for initiating buprenorphine by patients at home after an initial encounter with a clinician to establish the diagnosis of opioid use disorder and discuss medication options are in use by more experienced clinicians.

Withdrawal management with buprenorphine — initiation, dosing, and special considerations indicates buprenorphine withdrawal management can be done either in an outpatient or an inpatient setting, none of the available forms are specifically FDA-approved for withdrawal management but they may be used for this purpose, and none of the products have shown superiority over another for this purpose. Because buprenorphine is a partial μ opioid receptor agonist with a higher affinity for the mu-receptor than most full agonists, it is important that buprenorphine not be started until a patient is exhibiting objective signs of opioid withdrawal to avoid precipitated withdrawal; opioid withdrawal usually occurs up to 12–18 hours after the last dose of short-acting opioids and up to 24–48 hours after the last dose of a long-acting agonist. Providers should consider dosing for buprenorphine in an inpatient setting where the patient can be closely monitored. With fentanyl, which has a long half-life (8–10 hours), some clinicians have recommended waiting until patients are in at least moderate withdrawal (COWS score of 13 or more) before initiating buprenorphine. Withdrawal management with buprenorphine should start with an initial dose of 2–4 mg, titrated up as needed to control withdrawal (generally 4–16 mg per day), and the duration of the tapering schedule can be as brief as 3–5 days or over 30 days; clinicians should be guided by patient response in determining the optimum duration of the taper.

### Point / counterpoint: should full agonist opioid medications be offered to hospitalized patients for management of opioid withdrawal? [^11722fZC]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In contrast, standard protocols for methadone and buprenorphine initiation and dose titration can be easily followed by most hospitalists. If a patient reports ongoing withdrawal symptoms, pain, or cravings with methadone or buprenorphine dose titration, the hospitalist can augment therapy with additional doses of methadone or buprenorphine or with short-acting opioids. We believe this approach is better supported by evidence. It is also more likely to be implemented, since it makes fewer demands on nursing staff compared to oxycodone or hydromorphone monotherapy, where patients are more likely to face peaks and troughs in opioid withdrawal relief. Thus, we believe this approach would be more effective for opioid withdrawal management and could thereby decrease the risk of unprescribed substance use in the hospital, contentious interactions between hospital staff and patients, and self-directed discharges.

Some patients may decline methadone and buprenorphine even for opioid withdrawal. In these circumstances, hospitalists should explore this reluctance and debunk misconceptions. For example, hospitalists should ensure that patients understand that methadone does not precipitate withdrawal and that it does not block the effects of other full-agonist opioids at doses used for opioid withdrawal; methadone can only help relieve opioid withdrawal symptoms and will not make these symptoms worse. For some high-risk patients who continue to decline methadone and buprenorphine for withdrawal, clinicians might need to reach for alternative long-acting opioids, as the Point authors suggest. This will depend on the clinical circumstances. Patients certainly have autonomy to decline treatments or to choose between equally effective medications. However, there are situations where this might not be appropriate — for OUD, as with other conditions, there are clinical circumstances where we would not order less effective treatments based solely on patient preference (e.g. we would not let patient preference alone determine which antibiotics to use for sepsis). With all that said, in our experience, it is exceedingly rare for patients to continue to decline both methadone and buprenorphine for opioid withdrawal once we clarify the distinction between using these medications for opioid withdrawal management in the hospital and using them as long-term maintenance treatment after discharge.

### Extended-release 7-day injectable buprenorphine for mild opioid withdrawal… [^116Q2xkP]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Among the patients, 10 experienced a 5-point or greater increase in COWS and 7 transitioned to moderate or greater withdrawal within 4 hours, and 2 experienced precipitated withdrawal within 1 hour of extended-release buprenorphine. A total of 7 patients experienced precipitated withdrawal within 4 hours of extended-release buprenorphine, which included 2 of 63 with a COWS score of 4 to 7 and 5 of 37 with a COWS score of 0 to 3. Of those, 7 transitioned to moderate or greater withdrawal, defined as COWS scores of 13 or greater within 4 hours of the extended-release buprenorphine injection and experienced precipitated withdrawal in the 4 hours after injection, which included 2 of 63 patients with a COWS score of 4 to 7 and 5 of 37 with a COWS score of 0 to
3.

A total of 14 adverse events occurred in 13 patients during the 7-day observation period. This included 7 patients with precipitated withdrawal, 1 reporting nausea and vomiting, 1 with transient loss of smell, and 1 with substance use and depression. Five of the 14 adverse events were considered serious adverse events, as hospitalization was required, of which 2 were associated with medication. Among the 5 adverse events considered serious, 2 were among the 7 patients who experienced precipitated withdrawal, 1 was for substance use and depression, 1 was for cellulitis, and 1 was for a mental health disorder. Only the precipitated withdrawal and nausea and vomiting were related to extended-release buprenorphine. eTable 4 in Supplement 2 details all US Food and Drug Administration domains associated with intensity, relationship, seriousness, and attribution.

Importantly, opioid dosage thresholds for caution in the treatment of pain are not applicable to opioid agonist treatment of opioid use disorder because recommended dosages of methadone and buprenorphine for opioid use disorder differ from those for pain management. No recommended duration limit exists for treatment of opioid use disorder with buprenorphine or methadone, and discontinuation is associated with risks for return to drug use and opioid overdose. If discontinued, buprenorphine should be tapered very gradually (over several months).

Compared with buprenorphine, which can be prescribed by clinicians with a waiver in any setting or dispensed from a SAMHSA-certified opioid treatment program, ongoing methadone treatment for opioid use disorder can only be provided through an opioid treatment program. As short-term exceptions, any clinician may administer (but not prescribe) methadone or buprenorphine to treat acute opioid withdrawal for up to 3 days, while working to refer the patient to opioid use disorder treatment. Previously, up to a 1-day supply could be administered per day for up to 3 days; in December 2020, Congress directed the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to revise regulations to allow for a 3-day supply of medication to be dispensed at one time; DEA subsequently advised practitioners how to request exceptions to the 1-day supply limitation pending amendment of 21 CFR 1306.07(b). Patients already receiving treatment for opioid use disorder and admitted for other medical reasons may continue to directly receive methadone or buprenorphine treatment in an emergency department or in a hospital throughout inpatient hospitalization.

Naltrexone does not require a waiver and can be prescribed in any setting. Additional recommendations have been published previously on naltrexone treatment for opioid use disorder. A minimum of 7–10 days free of opioids is recommended before the first naltrexone dose to avoid precipitation of severe opioid withdrawal. Extended-release injectable naltrexone is typically administered every 4 weeks by deep intramuscular injection in the gluteal muscle at 380 mg per injection, alternating buttocks for each subsequent injection. Certain patients, including those who metabolize naltrexone more rapidly, might benefit from dosing as frequently as every 3 weeks. Oral naltrexone is no longer recommended and should not be used except under very limited circumstances. No recommended duration limit exists for treatment of opioid use disorder with naltrexone. If discontinued, naltrexone can be stopped abruptly without precipitating withdrawal symptoms. Clinicians should warn patients who discontinue naltrexone of the risk for potentially fatal opioid overdose if opioid use is resumed, because of the loss of tolerance to the previous opioid dosage.

Precipitated Opioid Withdrawal

The symptoms of spontaneous opioid withdrawal (which are associated with the discontinuation of opioid in a dependent individual) are uncomfortable, but they are not generally believed to be severe or necessitate hospitalization. However, when withdrawal is precipitated abruptly by the administration of an opioid antagonist to an opioid-dependent patient, the resulting withdrawal syndrome can be severe enough to require hospitalization. Symptoms of withdrawal have usually appeared within five minutes of ingestion of naltrexone hydrochloride and have lasted for up to 48 hours. Mental status changes including confusion, somnolence and visual hallucinations have occurred. Significant fluid losses from vomiting and diarrhea have required intravenous fluid administration. Review of postmarketing cases of precipitated opioid withdrawal in association with naltrexone treatment has identified cases with symptoms of withdrawal severe enough to require hospital admission, and in some cases, management in the intensive care unit.

To prevent occurrence of precipitated withdrawal in patients dependent on opioids, or exacerbation of a pre-existing subclinical withdrawal syndrome, opioid-dependent patients, including those being treated for alcohol dependence, should be opioid-free (including tramadol) before starting naltrexone hydrochloride treatment. An opioid-free interval of a minimum of 7 to 10 days is recommended for patients previously dependent on short-acting opioids. Patients transitioning from buprenorphine or methadone may be vulnerable to precipitation of withdrawal symptoms for as long as two weeks.

If a more rapid transition from agonist to antagonist therapy is deemed necessary and appropriate by the healthcare provider, monitor the patient closely in an appropriate medical setting where precipitated withdrawal can be managed.

In every case, healthcare providers should always be prepared to manage withdrawal symptomatically with non-opioid medications because there is no completely reliable method for determining whether a patient has had an adequate opioid-free period. A naloxone challenge test may be helpful; however, a few case reports have indicated that patients may experience precipitated withdrawal despite having a negative urine toxicology screen or tolerating a naloxone challenge test (usually in the setting of transitioning from buprenorphine treatment). Patients should be made aware of the risks associated with precipitated withdrawal and encouraged to give an accurate account of last opioid use. Patients treated for alcohol dependence with naltrexone hydrochloride should also be assessed for underlying opioid dependence and for any recent use of opioids prior to initiation of treatment with naltrexone hydrochloride. Precipitated opioid withdrawal has been observed in alcohol-dependent patients in circumstances where the prescriber had been unaware of the additional use of opioids or co-dependence on opioids.

### Trends and rapidity of dose tapering among patients prescribed long-term opioid therapy, 2008–2017 [^111u3T2Y]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Millions of individuals in the United States use opioids for chronic pain. A 2016 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) prescribing guideline encouraged nonopioid therapies for chronic pain, questioned daily dosages above 50 morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs), and advised avoidance of daily dosages of 90 MMEs or higher. The guideline recommended tapering of opioids when the risks outweigh the benefits. The overall volume of opioid prescribing decreased contemporaneously with the publication of the guideline. Local or regional policies limiting opioid prescriptions or enforcing clinician use of prescription drug monitoring programs may also encourage opioid tapering.

The CDC guideline recommended gradual dose reduction when tapering (ie, approximately 10% per week, possibly slower for patients with long-term use) to minimize withdrawal symptoms. This rate of dose reduction has been well tolerated by patients who are tapering opioid doses voluntarily while being closely monitored within multidisciplinary clinical programs, but there is limited evidence regarding optimal dose reduction rates in other clinical settings. In community practice, anecdotal reports suggest that many patients using long-term opioids are being forced to taper opioid doses involuntarily, and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently alerted health care professionals to avoid rapid opioid dose tapering among physically dependent patients because of potential hazards of serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, psychological distress, and suicide.

To our knowledge, there are no systematic studies of the extent to which patients prescribed long-term opioid therapy undertake dose tapering or how frequently patients are rapidly tapering opioid doses. In this study, we examined trends in dose tapering among US patients prescribed long-term opioids, patient-level factors associated with dose tapering, and the rapidity of dose reduction among patients tapering long-term opioids. We hypothesized that dose tapering has become increasingly common in recent years, particularly after the publication of the 2016 CDC guideline, that higher baseline opioid doses would be associated with tapering, and that dose reduction would often occur at a pace that would be likely to precipitate adverse effects in long-term users.

### American college of medical toxicology and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology position statement: nalmefene should not replace naloxone as the primary opioid antidote at this time [^116n5y8K]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2024). High credibility.

Nalmefene versus naloxone — withdrawal duration and observation needs are contrasted as follows: In the case of naloxone, severe withdrawal usually lasts less than an hour with symptoms typically persisting no more than 90 minutes, whereas a longer-acting antagonist is anticipated to cause longer-lasting precipitated withdrawal and may lead to worse patient outcomes, and clinical experience with both naltrexone and nalmefene suggests prolonged withdrawal is a complication of longer-acting opioid antagonists. Patients who receive nalmefene may require longer periods of observation, by up to several hours, to observe for recrudescent effects as the antagonist effects wane, will still need medical observation to ensure that respiratory depression does not recur after the effects of the medication subside, and this will prolong ED visit length and further burden a taxed system.

Opioid withdrawal — onset, duration, and precipitated withdrawal: Opioid withdrawal generally results from the cessation or a dramatic reduction in the dose of opioids. For short-acting opioids such as heroin and oxycodone, symptoms usually emerge within 12 hours of the last opioid use, peak within 24–48 hours, and diminish over 3–5 days. For long-acting opioids such as methadone, withdrawal symptoms generally emerge within 30 hours of the last methadone exposure and may last up to 10 days. Abrupt discontinuation of opioids is not recommended because it may precipitate withdrawal, lead to strong cravings, and result in relapse to drug use. Signs and symptoms of precipitated withdrawal are similar to those of spontaneous withdrawal, but the time course is different, and symptoms may be much more severe. The timing of maximal precipitated withdrawal usually occurs within 1 minute for intravenously administered naloxone, several minutes after IM naloxone, up to 90 minutes after sublingual buprenorphine, and up to several hours after extended-release injectable naltrexone. Naloxone-precipitated withdrawal typically lasts for 30–60 minutes, whereas naltrexone-precipitated withdrawal may last for several days. Withdrawal management is not necessary or recommended for patients being referred for treatment with methadone or buprenorphine.

POINT

Opioid Agonist Therapy for Hospitalized Patients with Opioid Use Disorder: An Alternate Treatment Pathway

Drs. Stern, D'Orazio, and Work

In the setting of the ongoing national overdose crisis, there is an urgent need for novel approaches to quality and compassionate patient care. People with opioid use disorder (OUD) are frequently hospitalized, often with complications of substance use, and experience disproportionately worse health outcomes than those without OUD. Such hospitalizations are often marked by uncontrolled pain and withdrawal symptoms, as well as patient-directed discharge. The standard of care treatment for people with OUD is one of three Food and Drug Administration-approved medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), including methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone, and the hospital setting has been identified as a "reachable moment" for initiation of MOUD. There has been recent interest in the use of short-acting opioid agonist therapy for hospitalized patients with opioid withdrawal. – We argue that the current armamentarium of treatment options are inadequate for effective care of all hospitalized patients with OUD, and that additional opioid agonist therapies such as oxycodone and hydromorphone, including both long-acting and short-acting formulations, should be included as a vital component of in-hospital management of opioid withdrawal.

Buprenorphine and methadone are highly effective medications for people with OUD, improving treatment retention, decreasing illicit opioid use, and improving mortality. But what reasonable options exist for patients who are not interested in MOUD during periods of hospitalization? In the setting of prior personal experience, concerns about withdrawal, or ongoing uncontrolled pain, patients with severe opioid dependence do not uniformly choose to initiate buprenorphine or methadone upon admission to the hospital. While novel methods of buprenorphine initiation that bypass the need for a pretreatment withdrawal period are becoming commonplace, fear of precipitated opioid withdrawal, and concerns over effective analgesia, lead many patients to decline treatment with buprenorphine when hospitalized. Methadone is a full opioid agonist and a natural choice for pain management and withdrawal relief, however, efficacious dosing for management of pain and withdrawal symptoms often requires several days of subtherapeutic treatment dosing. Delays in achieving therapeutic dosing are especially noteworthy in light of the presence of highly potent fentanyl in the contaminated and unregulated US drug supply. Even if adequate dosing can be achieved during a period of hospitalization, continuation of newly started methadone following hospitalization is fraught with prohibitive region-specific logistical and legal hurdles, in particular for patients who require extended stays in postacute care facilities.

### Clinical policy: critical issues related to opioids in adult patients presenting to the emergency department [^112KsCiL]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Buprenorphine for opioid withdrawal in the ED — cautions and monitoring include administering buprenorphine only to patients in active opioid withdrawal confirmed by history and physical examination, recognizing that its high binding affinity and partial agonist properties may induce significant withdrawal if the patient is currently receiving opioids; particular care is required when transitioning from methadone to buprenorphine because of risk of severe and prolonged precipitated withdrawal, tools such as the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale may assist with assessing severity, and because ED dosing data are evolving, monitoring best practices is prudent with additional information available at the listed resources.

Transitioning from methadone to buprenorphine — dosing, timing, and withdrawal thresholds specify that lower methadone doses transition more comfortably, initiation should occur in withdrawal, and specific buprenorphine doses are outlined. "Patients on low doses of methadone (30–40 mg per day or less) generally tolerate the transition to buprenorphine with minimal discomfort; whereas patients on higher doses of methadone may find that transitioning causes significant discomfort". "To minimize the risk of precipitated withdrawal, it is recommended that clinicians use careful initial dosing followed by rapid titration up to an appropriate maintenance dose". "Patients should be experiencing mild to moderate opioid withdrawal before the transition. This would typically occur up to 24–48 hours after the last dose of methadone", and "A COWS score of 11–12 or more is generally sufficient for significant withdrawal to allow a safe and comfortable initiation onto buprenorphine". "An initial dose of 2–4 mg of buprenorphine should be given… [and] additional 2–8 mg doses as needed to suppress withdrawal symptoms".

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^117LwsHF]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, more specifically with respect to naltrexone, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to plan and monitor transitioning from naltrexone to methadone or buprenorphine. Recognize that transitioning from an antagonist (naltrexone) to a full agonist (methadone) or a partial agonist (buprenorphine) is generally less complicated than transitioning from a full or partial agonist to an antagonist because there is no physical dependence associated with antagonist treatment and thus no possibility of precipitated withdrawal. Start methadone or buprenorphine with initial low doses as patients being transitioned from naltrexone to buprenorphine or methadone will not have a physical dependence on opioids. Do not make the transition until a significant amount of naltrexone is no longer in the patient's system, about 1 day for oral naltrexone or 28 days for extended-release injectable naltrexone.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, more specifically with respect to naltrexone, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to recommend a duration of naltrexone treatment. Decide on the duration depending on the clinical judgment and the patient's individual circumstances. Recognize that naltrexone can be stopped abruptly without withdrawal symptoms because there is no physical dependence associated with naltrexone.

### Establishing a research agenda for the study and assessment of opioid withdrawal [^112xD74R]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2024). High credibility.

The opioid crisis is an international public health concern. Treatments for opioid use disorder centre largely on the management of opioid withdrawal, an aversive collection of signs and symptoms that contribute to opioid use disorder. Whereas in the past 50 years more than 90 medications have been developed for depression, only five medications have been developed for opioid use disorder during this period. We posit that underinvestment has occurred in part due to an underdeveloped understanding of opioid withdrawal syndrome. This Personal View summarises substantial gaps in our understanding of opioid withdrawal that are likely to continue to limit major advancements in its treatment. There is no firm consensus in the field as to how withdrawal should be precisely defined; 10–550 symptoms of withdrawal can be measured on 18 scales. The imprecise understanding of withdrawal is likely to result in overestimating or underestimating the severity of an individual's withdrawal syndrome or potential therapeutic effects of different candidate medications. The severity of the opioid crisis is not remitting, and an international research agenda for the study and assessment of opioid withdrawal is necessary to support transformational changes in withdrawal management and treatment of opioid use disorder. Nine actionable targets are delineated here: develop a consensus definition of opioid withdrawal; understand withdrawal symptomatology after exposure to different opioids (particularly fentanyl); understand precipitated opioid withdrawal; understand how co-exposure of other drugs (eg, xylazine and stimulants) influences withdrawal expression; examine individual variation in withdrawal phenotypes; precisely characterise the protracted withdrawal syndrome; identify biomarkers of opioid withdrawal severity; identify predictors of opioid withdrawal severity; and understand which symptoms are most closely associated with treatment attrition or relapse. The US Food and Drug Administration recently established a formal indication for opioid withdrawal that has invigorated interest in drug development for opioid withdrawal management. Action is now needed to support these interests and help industry identify new classes of medications so that real change can be achieved for people with opioid use disorder.

VA/DoD chronic pain guideline — buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone dosing highlights that a low dose buprenorphine initiation (LDBI) strategy is designed to avoid precipitated withdrawal during conversion and introduces small incremental doses of buprenorphine while either slowly reducing the full opioid agonist over time or maintaining the full agonist dose and then stopping it once the buprenorphine dose is sufficient to mitigate withdrawal symptoms. Dosing may be titrated to 16 to 24 mg/day in divided doses if needed, and the document notes there is no consensus regarding a particular LDI approach.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^113uicn2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hepatotoxicity

Cases of hepatitis and clinically significant liver dysfunction were observed in association with naltrexone hydrochloride exposure during the clinical development program and in the postmarketing period. Transient, asymptomatic hepatic transaminase elevations were also observed in the clinical trials and postmarketing period. When patients presented with elevated transaminases, there were often other potential causative or contributory etiologies identified, including pre-existing alcoholic liver disease, hepatitis B and/or C infection, and concomitant usage of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Although clinically significant liver dysfunction is not typically recognized as a manifestation of opioid withdrawal, opioid withdrawal that is precipitated abruptly may lead to systemic sequelae, including acute liver injury.

Patients should be warned of the risk of hepatic injury and advised to seek medical attention if they experience symptoms of acute hepatitis. Use of naltrexone hydrochloride should be discontinued in the event of symptoms and/or signs of acute hepatitis.

Depression and Suicidality

Depression, suicide, attempted suicide and suicidal ideation have been reported in the postmarketing experience with naltrexone hydrochloride used in the treatment of opioid dependence. No causal relationship has been demonstrated. In the literature, endogenous opioids have been theorized to contribute to a variety of conditions.

Alcohol- and opioid-dependent patients, including those taking naltrexone hydrochloride, should be monitored for the development of depression or suicidal thinking. Families and caregivers of patients being treated with naltrexone hydrochloride should be alerted to the need to monitor patients for the emergence of symptoms of depression or suicidality, and to report such symptoms to the patient's healthcare provider.

Ultra Rapid Opioid Withdrawal

Safe use of naltrexone in ultra rapid opiate detoxification programs has not been established (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^114dBh2M]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

To reduce the risk of precipitated withdrawal in patients dependent on opioids, or exacerbation of a preexisting subclinical withdrawal syndrome, opioid-dependent patients, including those being treated for alcohol dependence, should be opioid-free (including tramadol) before starting naltrexone hydrochloride tablets treatment. An opioid-free interval of a minimum of 7 to 10 days is recommended for patients previously dependent on short-acting opioids.

Switching from Buprenorphine, Buprenorphine/Naloxone, or Methadone

There are no systematically collected data that specifically address the switch from buprenorphine or methadone to naltrexone hydrochloride tablets; however, review of postmarketing case reports have indicated that some patients may experience severe manifestations of precipitated withdrawal when being switched from opioid agonist therapy to opioid antagonist therapy (see WARNINGS). Patients transitioning from buprenorphine or methadone may be vulnerable to precipitation of withdrawal symptoms for as long as 2 weeks. Healthcare providers should be prepared to manage withdrawal symptomatically with non-opioid medications.

Treatment of Alcoholism

A dose of 50 mg once daily is recommended for most patients. The placebo-controlled studies that demonstrated the efficacy of naltrexone hydrochloride as an adjunctive treatment of alcoholism used a dose regimen of naltrexone hydrochloride 50 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks. Other dose regimens or durations of therapy were not evaluated in these trials.

Naltrexone hydrochloride tablets should be considered as only one of many factors determining the success of treatment of alcoholism. Factors associated with a good outcome in the clinical trials with naltrexone hydrochloride tablets were the type, intensity, and duration of treatment; appropriate management of comorbid conditions; use of community-based support groups; and good medication compliance. To achieve the best possible treatment outcome, appropriate compliance-enhancing techniques should be implemented for all components of the treatment program, especially medication compliance.

Treatment of Opioid Dependence

Treatment should be initiated with an initial dose of 25 mg of naltrexone hydrochloride tablets. If no withdrawal signs occur, the patient may be started on 50 mg a day thereafter.

A dose of 50 mg once a day will produce adequate clinical blockade of the actions of parenterally administered opioids. As with many non-agonist treatments for addiction, naltrexone hydrochloride tablets are of proven value only when given as part of a comprehensive plan of management that includes some measure to ensure the patient takes the medication.

Appropriate clinical management of opioid withdrawal is a crucial bridge to long-term treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD), because it is a high-risk time for potential opioid overdose and relapse. We provide a narrative review of evidence-based opioid withdrawal management strategies applicable to a variety of treatment settings and geographies. The goals of opioid withdrawal management include relieving suffering associated with withdrawal, providing appropriate diagnosis and screening, engaging patients in initiation of OUD treatment, and using harm reduction strategies, all guided by a patient-centered approach to care. In addition, we discuss complex cases, relapse prevention strategies, and new developments in opioid withdrawal management.

### Efficacy of transdermal buprenorphine patch for managing withdrawal symptoms in patients with cancer physically dependent on prescription opioids [^111wxS38]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of TBP in managing physical dependence on prescription opioids among cancer survivors. Discontinuation of offending opioids at the 8-week follow-up visit was achieved in 58% of the ITT population, 64% of the FAS population, and 72% of the PP population. Secondary outcomes revealed significant reductions in MEDD, COWS, and desire to use opioids, and improvements in the willingness and distress to discontinue opioids, indicating the role of TBP in reducing the physical and psychological aspects of opioid dependence. The safety profile of TBP is generally favorable, with mild and manageable adverse events and no severe precipitated withdrawal during the induction and stabilization phases.

The success rate of 58% of the ITT population for discontinuing offending opioids in this study is comparable to that reported in previous studies that assessed the efficacy of sublingual buprenorphine for prescription or nonprescription opioid dependence. In a 42-month follow-up of a prescription opioid addiction treatment study, a success rate of 61% was reported with buprenorphine-naloxone plus standard medical management for prescription opioid dependence in patients without cancer with chronic pain. Specifically, 31.7% of participants abstained from opioids and were not on agonist therapy, and 29.4% were receiving opioid agonist therapy without meeting the criteria for current opioid dependence. Long-term follow-up data from a randomized trial comparing buprenorphine/naloxone to methadone demonstrated that 57% of participants who received buprenorphine/naloxone did not use heroin or prescription opioids over the follow-up period. Furthermore, a recent study showed a 42% retention rate over 6 months, a surrogate marker for treatment adherence, in patients who initiated buprenorphine treatment (94% of buprenorphine/naloxone) for OUD. Collectively, these findings suggest the effectiveness of buprenorphine-based treatments for the management of OUD and its related conditions in various settings and populations.

### Buprenorphine: a primer for emergency physicians [^114BU6yA]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The recent approval of office-based treatment for opioid addiction and US Food and Drug Administration approval of buprenorphine will expand treatment options for opioid addiction. Buprenorphine is classified as a partial micro opioid agonist and a weak kappa antagonist. It has a high affinity for the micro receptor, with slow dissociation resulting in a long duration of action and an analgesic potency 25 to 40 times more potent than morphine. At higher doses, its agonist effects plateau and it begins to behave more like an antagonist, limiting the maximal analgesic effect and respiratory depression. This "ceiling effect" confers a high safety profile clinically, a low level of physical dependence, and only mild withdrawal symptoms on cessation after prolonged administration. Suboxone contains a mixture of buprenorphine and naloxone. The naloxone is poorly absorbed sublingually and is designed to discourage intravenous use. Subutex, buprenorphine only, will also be available primarily as an initial test dose. Clinicians will be using this drug for detoxification or for maintenance of opioid addiction. Patients with recent illicit opioid use may develop a mild precipitated withdrawal syndrome with the induction of buprenorphine. Acute buprenorphine intoxication may present with some diffuse mild mental status changes, mild to minimal respiratory depression, small but not pinpoint pupils, and relatively normal vital signs. Naloxone may improve respiratory depression but will have limited effect on other symptoms. Patients with significant symptoms related to buprenorphine should be admitted to the hospital for observation because symptoms will persist for 12 to 24 hours.

Opioid withdrawal management — settings and assessment states that opioid withdrawal management may occur in either inpatient or outpatient settings, there is a lack of evidence to determine the relative safety of inpatient versus outpatient withdrawal management, and inpatient withdrawal management has higher rates of completion compared to outpatient withdrawal management without a demonstrable difference in relapse; for patients with significant or unstable physical or mental health issues, treatment in an inpatient setting with monitored withdrawal may be preferred. The Clinical Institute Narcotic Assessment (CINA) scale is described as a mix of subjective and objective measures assessing 11 common signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal.

### Evidence of buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal in persons who use fentanyl [^115GEXkw]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Buprenorphine can precipitate withdrawal in opioid-dependent persons with recent fentanyl use. However, the prevalence of this phenomenon is not clinically established. We sought to evaluate the incidence of buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal in persons who use fentanyl.

Methods

We collected self-report data on opioid withdrawal symptoms after buprenorphine use, and, as a comparator, after methadone use, in 1679 individuals seeking treatment for opioid use disorder across 49 addiction treatment centers in the United States.

Results

The odds of developing severe withdrawal symptoms significantly increased when taking buprenorphine within 24 hours after fentanyl use (OR = 5.202, 95% CI = 1.979–13.675, P = 0.001), and within 24 to 48hours after fentanyl use (OR = 3.352, 95% CI = 1.237–9.089, P = 0.017). As expected, patients did not report significantly higher rates of withdrawal when taking methadone after fentanyl use. Of those who waited less than 24hours after fentanyl before using buprenorphine or methadone, 22.19% (n = 152 of 685) and 11.56% (n = 23 of 199), respectively, reported severe opioid withdrawal.

Conclusions

This study supports previous anecdotal reports of buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal from fentanyl. The odds of withdrawal symptoms significantly increased when taking buprenorphine after recent (within 48 hours) fentanyl use, however, this relationship was not observed in persons taking methadone, suggesting that this effect is specific to buprenorphine. Further research is urgently needed to describe the pharmacokinetics of non-medical fentanyl use to improve buprenorphine inductions strategies.

### Naloxone hydrochloride nasal (naloxone hydrochloride) [^114v27AJ]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.3	Precipitation of Severe Opioid Withdrawal

The use of Naloxone HCl Nasal Spray in patients who are opioid-dependent may precipitate opioid withdrawal characterized by the following signs and symptoms: body aches, diarrhea, tachycardia, fever, runny nose, sneezing, piloerection, sweating, yawning, nausea or vomiting, nervousness, restlessness or irritability, shivering or trembling, abdominal cramps, weakness, and increased blood pressure. In neonates, opioid withdrawal may be life-threatening if not recognized and properly treated and may include the following signs and symptoms: convulsions, excessive crying, and hyperactive reflexes. Monitor the patient for the development of the signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal.

There are limited data to inform if the 2 mg dose of Naloxone HCl Nasal Spray will avoid precipitation of severe opioid withdrawal in the setting of opioid dependence. However, the 2 mg dose may not provide an adequate and timely reversal in persons who may be exposed to an overdose of a potent or very high dose of opioids.

Abrupt postoperative reversal of opioid depression after using naloxone hydrochloride may result in nausea, vomiting, sweating, tremulousness, tachycardia, hypotension, hypertension, seizures, ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, pulmonary edema, and cardiac arrest. Death, coma, and encephalopathy have been reported as sequelae of these events. These events have primarily occurred in patients who had pre-existing cardiovascular disorders or received other drugs that may have similar adverse cardiovascular effects. Although a direct cause and effect relationship has not been established, after use of naloxone hydrochloride, monitor patients with pre-existing cardiac disease or patients who have received medications with potential adverse cardiovascular effects for hypotension, ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, and pulmonary edema in an appropriate healthcare setting. It has been suggested that the pathogenesis of pulmonary edema associated with the use of naloxone hydrochloride is similar to neurogenic pulmonary edema, i.e., a centrally mediated massive catecholamine response leading to a dramatic shift of blood volume into the pulmonary vascular bed resulting in increased hydrostatic pressures.

There may be clinical settings, particularly the postpartum period in neonates with known or suspected exposure to maternal opioid use, where it is preferable to avoid the abrupt precipitation of opioid withdrawal symptoms. In these settings, consider use of an alternative, naloxone-containing product that can be titrated to effect and, where applicable, dosed according to weight [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

### Evaluation of buprenorphine rotation in patients receiving long-term opioids for chronic pain: a systematic review [^114s17Gh]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Precipitated Opioid Withdrawal

Precipitated opioid withdrawal (defined as worsening withdrawal symptoms after receipt of the first dose of buprenorphine) was rare, according to very low– to low-quality evidence. The 7 studies that examined this outcome consisted of 2 small RCTs, 1 with a case-control design (secondary analysis of a large RCT), and 4 uncontrolled pre-post studies. Withdrawal symptoms were measured in 6 of 7 studies using the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (score ranges: 13–24, indicating moderate withdrawal; 25–36, indicating moderately severe withdrawal; and > 36, indicating severe withdrawal) or the Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (score ranges: 1–10, indicating mild withdrawal; 11–20, indicating moderate withdrawal; and 21–30 indicating severe withdrawal). Symptoms were typically measured within an hour before or after induction; 1 study took multiple measurements for the 12 hours after buprenorphine was initiated.

The incidence of precipitated withdrawal ranged from 3% to 6%. Assessed with the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale, the mean severity was in the low to moderate range (mean [SD], 13.6 [2.9]). The risk of withdrawal symptoms was greater when baseline opioid dose was higher. The specific full MOR agonist or its formulation (extended release vs immediate release) was not associated with withdrawal symptoms.

9.3 Dependence

Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during chronic opioid therapy. Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs, and may develop at different rates for different effects.

Physical dependence results in withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dosage reduction of a drug. Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued opioid usage.

### Things we Do for No reason ™: avoiding methadone for opioid withdrawal [^112fmE2d]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

WHY HOSPITALISTS SHOULD OFFER METHADONE FOR OPIOID WITHDRAWAL

More than 50 years of data demonstrate that methadone is safe and effective when titrated appropriately. Hospitalists can legally provide methadone for opioid withdrawal per 1306.07 Code of Federal Regulations. This code states that hospitalized patients can be "administered or dispensed opioids for maintenance or detoxification as an adjunct to a condition other than addiction". In other words, hospitalists can start, continue, and titrate methadone and other opioids for opioid withdrawal when patients are hospitalized for a primary condition other than a substance use disorder (e.g. cellulitis, heart failure, high-risk pregnancy).

Methadone is a life-saving medication that reduces overdose and all-cause mortality. It is associated with decreased acute care utilization and, by treating opioid withdrawal, a lower risk of self-discharges. Methadone should be offered for withdrawal management regardless of a patient's desire or ability to continue it after hospitalization. In addition to treating and preventing withdrawal, prescribing methadone during hospitalization offers an opportunity to initiate OUD treatment. Patients started on methadone for OUD are more than twice as likely to present to an OTP after discharge. Even when patients are ambivalent about continuing methadone after discharge, their readiness to engage in outpatient treatment likely increases as they achieve relief of withdrawal. However, only 15% of people with OUD receive OUD treatment during admission.

Without treatment, patients may use unprescribed opioids to manage withdrawal symptoms and self-discharge before completing medical treatment, increasing mortality and risk for rehospitalization. In one study, more than 40% of individuals who used drugs reported unprescribed substance use during hospitalization. Opioid agonists, like methadone, treat opioid withdrawal and may decrease in-hospital substance use while improving trust.

Methadone, in addition to being OUD treatment, offers important advantages to other full-agonist opioids in withdrawal treatment. This includes methadone's analgesic and long-acting properties, which we can leverage by splitting dosing to treat both acute pain and withdrawal. In addition, compared with a partial opioid agonist like buprenorphine, situations when patients may prefer methadone over buprenorphine include: (1) previous buprenorphine-induced precipitated withdrawal; (2) regular fentanyl use, which may increase the risk of precipitated withdrawal with buprenorphine initiation; (3) methadone's full opioid agonism; and (4) acute pain.

According to a 2001 consensus paper from the American Academy of Pain Medicine, American Pain Society, and American Society of Addiction Medicine, dependence is defined as "a state of adaptation that is manifested by a drug class specific withdrawal syndrome that can be produced by abrupt cessation, rapid dose reduction, decreasing blood level of the drug, or administration of an antagonist". The experience of children undergoing iatrogenic withdrawal symptoms is variable and may be mild and go unreported or can be severe and even life threatening. Guidance on opioid withdrawal is available only for adults and primarily for adults with substance use disorders. This report will summarize existing literature and provide readers with information on how to screen for symptoms of iatrogenic opioid withdrawal as well as mechanisms for opioid withdrawal prevention.

### Severe, nondelirium agitation as an underreported characteristic of precipitated fentanyl withdrawal: a case report [^114QuLkH]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Opioid overdose deaths continue to rise in conjunction with a surge in fentanyl use. Treating withdrawal and initiating recovery may involve rapid initiations of medications for opioid use disorder, such as buprenorphine, but there is a high risk of precipitated withdrawal. We report a case of a 30-year-old man in police custody who experienced precipitated fentanyl withdrawal, and it was refractory to continued buprenorphine escalation. After buprenorphine, he exhibited a particularly dramatic, nondelirium agitation, which we suspect is a common yet underreported characteristic of precipitated withdrawal. Although there was initial concern for delirium secondary to benzodiazepine withdrawal, this was ruled out by mental status examination and verified later by the patient himself. Nondelirium agitation, clarified by mental status testing, ought to be further reported and characterized in future studies of precipitated withdrawal as clinicians and researchers tackle the new challenges of widespread fentanyl use in the United States.

### Opioid antagonists with minimal sedation for opioid withdrawal [^115w6BxT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Managed withdrawal (detoxification) is necessary prior to drug-free treatment. It may also represent the end point of long-term opioid replacement treatment such as methadone maintenance.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions involving opioid antagonists to induce withdrawal, in combination with medication to ameliorate symptoms but with minimal sedation.

Search Strategy

Multiple databases were searched using a strategy designed to retrieve references broadly addressing opioid withdrawal. Reference lists of retrieved studies, reviews and conference abstracts were handsearched.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials or prospective controlled cohort studies that compared antagonist-induced (conscious) withdrawal with other approaches to modify the signs and symptoms of withdrawal in opioid-dependent participants.

Data Collection and Analysis

One reviewer assessed potentially relevant studies for inclusion and undertook data extraction. All inclusion decisions and the overall process were confirmed by consultation between all reviewers.

Main Results

Ten studies (5 randomised and 5 non-randomised controlled trials), involving 770 participants, met the inclusion criteria for the review. Treatment regimes using opioid antagonists to induce withdrawal, with minimal sedation, varied in a number of aspects preventing description of a "standard" approach. Antagonist-induced withdrawal is associated with similar or less overall severity than withdrawal managed primarily with an alpha2 adrenergic agonist. This is probably because of earlier resolution of withdrawal. Peak severity is likely to be higher with antagonist-induced withdrawal and require the use of additional adjunct medications. Withdrawal from methadone may be more severe than withdrawal from heroin, but data are limited. Antagonist-induced withdrawal appears to be associated with somewhat higher rates of completion of withdrawal and achievement of maintenance doses of naltrexone but there were insufficient data for statistical analyses. The benefit of higher rates of completion of withdrawal is lessened by apparently low rates of retention in subsequent naltrexone maintenance treatment.

Reviewer's Conclusions

The use of opioid antagonists combined with alpha2 adrenergic agonists is feasible and probably increases the likelihood of transfer to naltrexone compared to withdrawal managed primarily with an adrenergic agonist. A high level of monitoring and support is desirable for several hours following administration of opioid antagonists because of the possibility of vomiting, diarrhoea and delirium. Further research is required to confirm the relative effectiveness of antagonist-induced regimes, as well as variables influencing the severity of withdrawal, adverse effects, the most effective antagonist-based treatment regime, and approaches that might increase retention in subsequent naltrexone maintenance treatment.

### Fentanyl citrate [^112yoVW4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

9.3 Dependence

Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during chronic opioid therapy.

Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose).

Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in a response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dosage reduction of a drug.

Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued use.

Fentanyl Citrate Injection should not be abruptly discontinued in a physically-dependent patient. If Fentanyl Citrate Injection is abruptly discontinued in a physically-dependent patient, a withdrawal syndrome may occur, typically characterized by restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate.

Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

### Nalmefene hydrochloride (zurnai) [^111Zfskn]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3	Precipitation of Severe Opioid Withdrawal

The use of ZURNAI in patients who are opioid dependent may precipitate opioid withdrawal characterized by the following signs and symptoms: body aches, diarrhea, tachycardia, fever, runny nose, sneezing, piloerection, sweating, yawning, nausea or vomiting, nervousness, restlessness or irritability, shivering or trembling, abdominal cramps, weakness, and increased blood pressure.

Abrupt postoperative reversal of opioid depression after using ZURNAI may result in nausea, vomiting, sweating, tremulousness, tachycardia, hypotension, hypertension, seizures, ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, pulmonary edema, and cardiac arrest. Death, coma, and encephalopathy have been reported as sequelae of these events. These events have primarily occurred in patients who had pre-existing cardiovascular disorders or received other drugs that may have similar adverse cardiovascular effects. After use of ZURNAI, monitor patients with pre-existing cardiac disease or patients who have received medications with potential adverse cardiovascular effects for hypotension, ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, and pulmonary edema in an appropriate healthcare setting. It has been suggested that the pathogenesis of pulmonary edema associated with the use of nalmefene is similar to neurogenic pulmonary edema, i.e., a centrally mediated massive catecholamine response leading to a dramatic shift of blood volume into the pulmonary vascular bed resulting in increased hydrostatic pressures.

ZURNAI is not indicated for use in patients less than 12 years of age. In neonates, opioid withdrawal may be life-threatening if not recognized and properly treated and may include the following signs and symptoms: convulsions, excessive crying, and hyperactive reflexes. Monitor the patient for the development of the signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal. There may be clinical settings, particularly the postpartum period in neonates with known or suspected exposure to maternal opioid use, where it is preferable to avoid the abrupt precipitation of opioid withdrawal symptoms. In these settings, use an alternative, opioid antagonist product that can be titrated to effect and, where applicable, dosed according to weight [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

### The impact of high-potency synthetic opioids on pharmacotherapies for opioid use disorder: a scoping review [^113StcUz]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The clinical implications of high potency synthetic opioids (HPSO) on medications for opioid use disorder (MOUDs) are not well understood. Although pharmacological interactions are plausible, the clinical significance of such interaction has not been systematically elucidated. This scoping review investigates the relationship between HPSO exposure and various MOUD treatment outcomes.

Methods

We followed PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) for scoping reviews with extensive a priori search strategy of databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Cochrane.

Results

From 9149 studies, 34 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Synthesized data reveal several critical insights: First, there is a variable but high occurrence (38%-80%) of HPSO usage among individuals with MOUDs. Second, MOUDs are linked to a decreased risk of overdoses and deaths associated with HPSO. Third, HPSO consumption is correlated with the risk of precipitated withdrawal when starting buprenorphine. Fourth, low-dose buprenorphine is being recognized as one method to avoid moderate withdrawal symptoms prior to treatment. Lastly, significant gaps exist in human experimental data concerning the effects of HPSO on key factors critical for treating OUD-craving, withdrawal symptoms, and pain.

Conclusions

Current evidence supports MOUD safety and effectiveness in reducing nonmedical opioid use. Further research is needed to explore HPSO's influence on the acute factors preceding nonmedical opioid use, such as cravings, withdrawal symptoms, and pain. This research could inform the optimization of MOUD dosing strategies. Achieving consensus and harmonizing data across clinical and research protocols could diminish variability, enhancing our understanding of HPSOs effect on MOUD treatment outcomes.

### Post-acute withdrawal syndrome [^112ozUxn]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Post-acute withdrawal syndrome is an underresearched topic that affects many patients with substance use disorders after the cessation of substance use. Post-acute withdrawal syndrome is exemplified by the occurrence of substance-specific withdrawal signs and symptoms lasting well past the known timeframe for acute withdrawal of a used substance. Post-acute withdrawal syndrome may also include signs and symptoms that are not substance specific that persist, evolve, or appear well past the expected acute withdrawal timeframe. Unfortunately, there is very little scientific literature on post-acute withdrawal syndrome. As a result of this, there are no diagnostic criteria for post-acute withdrawal syndrome, and there is no consensus on the proper name for the condition. We present a case of a 38-year-old man who developed post-acute withdrawal syndrome after treatment with buprenorphine for opioid use disorder and review the limited existing literature on post-acute withdrawal syndrome.

### Clinical policy: critical issues related to opioids in adult patients presenting to the emergency department [^111f8Ld1]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Emergency department opioid withdrawal — benefits and harms of implementing the recommendations include the following: Adequate treatment of significant opioid withdrawal with the potential for engaging in medication for addiction treatment (also referred to as medications for OUD, or, historically, medical/medication-assisted treatment) for OUD. Potential harms include potential precipitation of opioid withdrawal after receiving buprenorphine in a patient not yet showing signs/symptoms of withdrawal, although this can be overcome with sufficient buprenorphine dosing; adverse effects of buprenorphine including the potential for respiratory depression, which is rare unless the patient is also receiving sedatives/hypnotics such as benzodiazepines; and a possible increased risk of opioid toxicity after methadone if discharged and additional opioids are used, which is not present with buprenorphine therapy because of its μ-receptor affinity and partial agonist activity resulting in a ceiling on respiratory depression.

### Naltrexone (Vivitrol) [^115SbBoT]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.3 Precipitation of Opioid Withdrawal

The symptoms of spontaneous opioid withdrawal (which are associated with the discontinuation of opioid in a dependent individual) are uncomfortable, but they are not generally believed to be severe or necessitate hospitalization. However, when withdrawal is precipitated abruptly by the administration of an opioid antagonist to an opioid-dependent patient, the resulting withdrawal syndrome can be severe enough to require hospitalization. Review of postmarketing cases of precipitated opioid withdrawal in association with naltrexone treatment has identified cases with symptoms of withdrawal severe enough to require hospital admission, and in some cases, management in the intensive care unit.

To prevent occurrence of precipitated withdrawal in patients dependent on opioids, or exacerbation of a pre-existing subclinical withdrawal syndrome, opioid-dependent patients, including those being treated for alcohol dependence, should be opioid-free (including tramadol) before starting VIVITROL treatment. An opioid-free interval of a minimum of 7–10 days is recommended for patients previously dependent on short-acting opioids. Patients transitioning from buprenorphine or methadone may be vulnerable to precipitation of withdrawal symptoms for as long as two weeks.

If a more rapid transition from agonist to antagonist therapy is deemed necessary and appropriate by the healthcare provider, monitor the patient closely in an appropriate medical setting where precipitated withdrawal can be managed.

In every case, healthcare providers should always be prepared to manage withdrawal symptomatically with non-opioid medications because there is no completely reliable method for determining whether a patient has had an adequate opioid-free period. A naloxone challenge test may be helpful; however, a few case reports have indicated that patients may experience precipitated withdrawal despite having a negative urine toxicology screen or tolerating a naloxone challenge test (usually in the setting of transitioning from buprenorphine treatment). Patients should be made aware of the risks associated with precipitated withdrawal and encouraged to give an accurate account of last opioid use. Patients treated for alcohol dependence with VIVITROL should also be assessed for underlying opioid dependence and for any recent use of opioids prior to initiation of treatment with VIVITROL. Precipitated opioid withdrawal has been observed in alcohol-dependent patients in circumstances where the prescriber had been unaware of the additional use of opioids or co-dependence on opioids.

### Utilization of full-agonist therapy for severe precipitated opioid withdrawal: a case series and retrospective analysis [^114s2QhW]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

We aim to describe our experience in treating severe precipitated opioid withdrawal with hydromorphone - a short-acting, full opioid agonist - followed by buprenorphine induction.

Methods

This is a retrospective chart review and case series conducted at a single hospital from May 1, 2023 to May 31, 2024 of patients who were seen by a medical toxicology service and received hydromorphone to treat precipitated opioid withdrawal. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the results as appropriate.

Results

There were 13 patients identified over the study period with severe opioid withdrawal, all suspected to be in precipitated withdrawal (most commonly by buprenorphine). Nearly all patients included in this study had improved withdrawal symptoms after administration of hydromorphone. There was only one patient that did not have adequate improvement with hydromorphone, and this individual required endotracheal intubation and sedation. All patients were discharged with a buprenorphine prescription.

Conclusions

The use of hydromorphone to treat precipitated opioid withdrawal symptoms is feasible and, in our study population, allowed for subsequent buprenorphine induction. Further study is needed to determine safety and efficacy of this approach versus traditional methods.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^113JpPeS]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — buprenorphine initiation timing and withdrawal thresholds: Patients who are currently dependent on opioids should wait until they are experiencing mild to moderate opioid withdrawal before the first dose, and clinicians should use objective signs of opioid withdrawal before initiating buprenorphine; generally, initiation should occur at least 6–12 hours after the last use of heroin or other short-acting opioids and 24–72 hours after the last use of long-acting opioids such as methadone, with a COWS score of 11–12 or more generally indicative of sufficient withdrawal. During office-based initiation, use of the COWS can be helpful, and some clinicians have recommended waiting for at least moderate withdrawal (COWS score of 13 or higher) in the context of fentanyl exposure, which is short acting but has a long half-life (8–10 hours), although there is little existing evidence addressing this issue.

### A case of buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal managed with high-dose buprenorphine [^111WC6KS]. Family Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Buprenorphine-naloxone has a very high affinity for the mu-receptor and can cause precipitated opioid withdrawal, typically more severe than withdrawal that occurs naturally, when administered while a full mu-opioid receptor agonist remains in a person's system. To avoid precipitated withdrawal, one needs to be in mild to moderate opioid withdrawal at the time of buprenorphine-naloxone induction. Recently, there have been reported cases of precipitated withdrawal occurring in patients taking fentanyl knowingly or unknowingly, despite them being in adequate opioid withdrawal at the time of induction. When this occurs, the current recommendation is to provide 2 mg of buprenorphine-naloxone every 1–2 hours.

Objectives

Describe a case of successful management of buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal with escalation of the dose of buprenorphine and highlight implications for future management.

Methods

We present a case of a patient with a history of opioid use disorder who was in moderate opioid withdrawal at the time of buprenorphine-naloxone induction and experienced precipitated withdrawal after buprenorphine-naloxone administration.

Results

High-dose buprenorphine-naloxone was given to the patient and precipitated withdrawal subsided after receiving a total of 20 mg. On the next day, the patient had no symptoms of opioid withdrawal and is currently maintained on 16 mg/day.

Conclusion

With the rising prevalence of fentanyl-laced drugs, increased instances of precipitated withdrawal are likely to be encountered. In cases of precipitated withdrawal, giving a high dose of buprenorphine-naloxone rapidly is safe and will allow rapid reversal of withdrawal symptoms.

### Evaluation of the effects of lofexidine and clonidine on naloxone-precipitated withdrawal in opioid-dependent humans [^111ur1TP]. Addiction (2003). Low credibility.

Aims

To examine the efficacy of lofexidine, an alpha2 adrenergic agonist, to suppress opioid withdrawal symptoms in opioid-dependent humans under in-patient laboratory conditions by using a naloxone challenge procedure.

Design

Randomized, within-subject, cross-over design with drug administration taking place under double-blind and triple-dummy conditions.

Setting

A 14-bed in-patient hospital research unit dedicated to the conduct of behavioral pharmacology studies.

Participants

Eight healthy adult volunteers (two female/six male) with histories of polysubstance abuse and current physical dependence on opioids.

Intervention

Participants were stabilized onto methadone and maintained on 30 mg/day, p.o. throughout the study. Oral placebo, lofexidine (0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 mg, p.o.) and clonidine (0.1 and 0.2 mg, p.o.) were each tested as pre-treatments once in combination with each of three intramuscular naloxone doses (0, 0.1 and 0.3 mg, i.m.) during 18 separate experimental sessions.

Measurements

An array of physiological indices (e.g. heart rate, blood pressure, pupil diameter) as well as a number of subjective and observer-rating scales sensitive to opioid withdrawal effects.

Findings

As expected, lofexidine and clonidine both produced dose-related decreases in blood pressure and heart rate but few subjective effects; naloxone increased opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Although both lofexidine and clonidine reduced the cardiovascular response to naloxone challenge, close inspection of the data reveal that this occurred only to the extent that baseline physiological parameters were reduced, while neither drug significantly modified the overall magnitude of the response to naloxone. Moreover, neither lofexidine nor clonidine suppressed the subjective discomfort of opioid withdrawal or significantly reduced other autonomic signs of opioid withdrawal, such as lacrimation or rhinorrhea.

Conclusions

These data suggest that lofexidine is well tolerated even at supratherapeutic acute doses. However, its failure to modify most signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal suggest that its effective use in spontaneous withdrawal will require concomitant medications for improved therapeutic response.

### Methadone induction for a patient with precipitated withdrawal in the emergency department: a case report [^111RLGqX]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

In the era of illicit fentanyl, reports on difficulties with buprenorphine inductions for patients with opioid use disorder are emerging. Methadone is the only other approved medication treatment with efficacy similar to buprenorphine but without risks of precipitated withdrawal. Unfortunately, outpatient methadone inductions can take days to weeks to complete, due in part to regulations that limit administration to opioid treatment programs. We describe a patient with opioid use disorder who presented to the emergency department in precipitated withdrawal who completed a same-day methadone induction with next-day dosing at an opioid treatment program as part of an emergency department methadone protocol. As opioid-related deaths rise, emergency department-initiated methadone is feasible for patients with opioid use disorder.

Opioid withdrawal and opioid use disorder (OUD) — Safety warnings emphasize that concurrent use of methadone or buprenorphine with alcohol or benzodiazepines increases respiratory depression risk, but concurrent treatment with benzodiazepines should not be a reason to withhold buprenorphine or methadone and increased monitoring may be appropriate; naltrexone is not approved by the FDA for withdrawal management, does not relieve withdrawal symptoms, and cannot be administered until patients are free of short-acting opioids for at least 7–10 days or 10–14 days for long-acting opioids, and failing to observe these wait periods may cause precipitated withdrawal; anesthesia-assisted opioid detoxification or ultra-rapid opioid detoxification has been associated with serious complications and is not recommended.

### Precipitated withdrawal in the era of street fentanyl… [^117YEu7R]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The only unique consideration in starting buprenorphine has been the recognition and avoidance of precipitated withdrawal. Due to its high affinity for the μ-opioid receptor, buprenorphine given too soon after the use of a full agonist may precipitate opioid withdrawal symptoms, including restlessness, sweating, anxiety, cramps, and tremors. Historically, avoiding precipitating withdrawal was straightforward and involved waiting to administer buprenorphine until the patient began to experience withdrawal, measured by the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale score. The article by Thakrar et al5 advances our understanding of buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal and its association with street fentanyl.

Their retrospective cohort study extracted data from the electronic health records of 226 adult patients with OUD who received buprenorphine at 3 urban academic hospitals in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021. Patients missing COWS documentation before or 4 hours after buprenorphine initiation and those with a low COWS score were excluded. The primary outcome was precipitated withdrawal, defined as an increase in COWS score of 5 points or greater from immediately before to within 4 hours after buprenorphine administration. The investigators also examined potential moderators including initial COWS score, initial buprenorphine dose, body mass index, and quantitative measurements of fentanyl in urine. Of the 226 patients in the study, 5 26 met criteria for precipitated withdrawal.

In the subgroup of 123 patients who had a positive urine fentanyl test result, 20 experienced precipitated withdrawal. While there was no association between precipitated withdrawal and initial COWS score or buprenorphine dose, the authors noted that precipitated withdrawal was associated with higher urine fentanyl concentrations and higher body mass index. Thakrar et al5 found a substantially higher rate of precipitated withdrawal than other studies. 6, 7 Snyder et al6 abstracted data from 492 emergency department patients with OUD who were part of California's CA Bridge program for OUD treatment. They found 8 patients had precipitated withdrawal documented in their medical records.

### Approach to buprenorphine use for opioid withdrawal treatment in the emergency setting [^115MxTDT]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Opioid use disorder (OUD) is increasing in prevalence throughout the world, with approximately three million individuals in the United States affected. Buprenorphine is a medication designed, researched, and effectively used to assist in OUD recovery.

Objective

This narrative review discusses an approach to initiating buprenorphine in the emergency department (ED) for opioid-abuse recovery.

Discussion

Buprenorphine is a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist with high affinity and low intrinsic activity. Buprenorphine's long half-life, high potency, and 'ceiling effect' for both euphoric sensation and adverse effects make it an optimal treatment alternative for patients presenting to the ED with opioid withdrawal. While most commonly provided as a sublingual film or tablet, buprenorphine can also be delivered via transbuccal, transdermal, subdermal (implant), subcutaneous, and parenteral routes. Prior to ED administration, caution is recommended to avoid precipitation of buprenorphine-induced opioid withdrawal. Following the evaluation of common opioid withdrawal symptoms, a step-by-step approach to buprenorphine can by utilized to reach a sustained withdrawal relief. A multimodal medication-assisted treatment (MAT) plan involving pharmacologic treatment, as well as counseling and behavioral therapy, is essential to maintaining opioid remission. Patients may be safely discharged with safe-use counseling, close outpatient follow-up, and return precautions for continued management of their OUD. Establishing a buprenorphine program in the ED involves a multifactorial approach to establish a pro-buprenorphine culture.

Conclusions

Buprenorphine is an evidence-based, safe, effective treatment option for OUD in an ED-setting. Though successfully utilized by many ED-based treatment programs, the stigma of 'replacing one opioid with another' remains a barrier. Evidence-based discussions on the safety and benefits of buprenorphine are essential to promoting a culture of acceptance and optimizing ED OUD treatment.

### Guidelines for managing substance withdrawal in jails [^117G8EuE]. NIC/BJA (2023). High credibility.

Opioid withdrawal symptom emergence and duration — For short-acting opioids (e.g., heroin, oxycodone), symptoms emerge within 12 hours of last use and peak within 24–48 hours, with a duration of 3–5 days. For long-acting opioids (e.g., methadone), symptoms emerge within 30 hours of last use and can last up to 10 days.

### Guidelines for managing substance withdrawal in jails [^115AGXGh]. NIC/BJA (2023). High credibility.

Buprenorphine initiation and monitoring — buprenorphine should be initiated when the patient shows objective signs or symptoms of withdrawal, and if initiated before the patient is showing signs of withdrawal the patient may experience precipitated withdrawal resulting in a higher COWS score and severe symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea; as determined by clinical consensus in the absence of data, the patient should be monitored by a qualified health care professional for at least 30 minutes after the initial administration, as precipitated withdrawal will require immediate treatment and may require a higher level of care. Due to the rapid pace at which clinical practice is changing, jails should collaborate closely with community providers and hospitals on evolving protocols for buprenorphine initiation. Buprenorphine is an effective medication for treating both opioid withdrawal and OUD, and recent changes in federal legislation allow buprenorphine to be prescribed by any prescriber with a DEA registration to prescribe controlled substances.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^114qw5SD]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

To avoid precipitating withdrawal, transitioning any patient taking full agonist opioids to buprenorphine requires specific timing of the initial buprenorphine dose (see Recommendation 12 for application to patients with opioid use disorder). Patients should be in mild to moderate withdrawal from full agonist opioids before the first buprenorphine dose. To do this, experts have advised that clinicians and patients should wait at least 8–12 hours after the last dose of short-acting full agonist opioids and longer after the last dose of long-acting full agonist opioids (e.g. at least 12–24 hours after the last dose of an ER/LA full agonist opioid, and longer for methadone) before the first dose of buprenorphine is administered. As an alternative for patients not yet in opioid withdrawal, certain studies have described low dose initiation of buprenorphine to allow for initiation of buprenorphine in patients receiving full agonist opioids for acute or chronic pain. SAMHSA's Providers Clinical Support System offers training, technical assistance, and mentors to assist clinicians who are unfamiliar with initiation of buprenorphine and have additional questions about the diagnosis and treatment of opioid use disorder. Because the duration of action for analgesia is shorter than the duration of action for suppression of opioid withdrawal and stabilization of opioid use disorder, dosing of buprenorphine for pain is typically multiple times daily rather than once-a-day dosing as done for the treatment of opioid use disorder.

### Guidelines for managing substance withdrawal in jails [^113QinAG]. NIC/BJA (2023). High credibility.

Opioid withdrawal considerations — pharmacotherapy approach and cautions are specified: Effective management of opioid withdrawal involves initiation of long-term buprenorphine or methadone. When administered in a timely manner, these medications prevent withdrawal and treat OUD. Naltrexone, another U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved medication for OUD, is not approved for withdrawal management purposes, does not relieve withdrawal symptoms, and may precipitate withdrawal. Opioid withdrawal management without ongoing pharmacotherapy does not treat the underlying OUD and leaves the patient at risk for overdose and death.

### American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) national practice guideline for the use of medications in the treatment of addiction involving opioid use [^111wRcQc]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Part 6: Naltrexone

Naltrexone is a recommended treatment in preventing relapse in opioid use disorder. Oral formula naltrexone may be considered for patients in whom adherence can be supervised. Extended-release injectable naltrexone may be more suitable for patients who have issues with adherence.

Oral naltrexone should be taken daily in 50-mg doses, or three times weekly in two 100-mg doses followed by one 150-mg dose.

Extended-release injectable naltrexone should be administered every 4 weeks by deep intramuscular injection in the gluteal muscle at a set dosage of 380 mg per injection.

Psychosocial treatment is recommended in conjunction with treatment with oral and extended-release injectable naltrexone.

There is no recommended length of treatment with oral naltrexone or extended-release injectable naltrexone. Duration depends on clinical judgment and the patient's individual circumstances. Because there is no physical dependence associated with naltrexone, it can be stopped abruptly without withdrawal symptoms.

Switching from naltrexone to methadone or buprenorphine should be planned, considered, and monitored. Switching from an antagonist such as naltrexone to a full agonist (methadone) or a partial agonist (buprenorphine) is generally less complicated than switching from a full or partial agonist to an antagonist because there is no physical dependence associated with antagonist treatment and thus no possibility of precipitated withdrawal. Patients being switched from naltrexone to buprenorphine or methadone will not have physical dependence on opioids, and thus the initial doses of methadone or buprenorphine used may be less than one would use in a patient currently physically dependent on opioids. Patients should not be switched until a significant amount of the naltrexone is no longer in their system, about 1 day for oral naltrexone or 30 days for extended-release injectable naltrexone.

Patients who discontinue antagonist therapy and resume opioid use should be made aware of the increased risks associated with an opioid overdose, and especially the increased risk of death.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^114th8zu]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Part 3: Treating opioid withdrawal — core recommendations and dosing: Using methadone or buprenorphine for opioid withdrawal management is recommended over abrupt cessation of opioids, since abrupt cessation may lead to strong cravings and/or acute withdrawal syndrome placing patients at risk for relapse, overdose, and overdose death. Opioid withdrawal management (i.e. detoxification) on its own, without ongoing treatment for opioid use disorder, is not a treatment method for opioid use disorder and is not recommended; patients should be advised about relapse and safety risks, and ongoing maintenance medication, in combination with psychosocial treatment appropriate for the patient's needs, is the standard of care for treating opioid use disorder. Assessment of a patient undergoing opioid withdrawal management should include a thorough medical history and physical examination, focusing on signs and symptoms associated with opioid withdrawal. By regulation, opioid withdrawal management with methadone must be done in an opioid treatment program (OTP) or in an acute care setting (under limited circumstances); for patients withdrawing from short acting opioids, methadone doses should typically be 20–30 mg per day and the dose may be tapered off in approximately 6–10 days. Opioid withdrawal management with buprenorphine should not be initiated until there are objective signs of opioid withdrawal; once signs of withdrawal have been objectively confirmed, a dose sufficient to suppress withdrawal symptoms is given with an initial dose of 2–4 mg titrated up as needed to suppress withdrawal symptoms. Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists (e.g. FDA-approved lofexidine and off-label clonidine) are safe and effective for management of opioid withdrawal; however, methadone and buprenorphine are more effective in reducing symptoms, in retaining patients in withdrawal management, and in supporting completion of withdrawal management. Opioid withdrawal management using ultra-rapid opioid detoxification (UROD) is not recommended due to high risk for adverse events or death, and naltrexone-facilitated opioid withdrawal management can be safe and effective but should be used only by clinicians experienced with this clinical method, and in cases in which anesthesia or conscious sedation are not employed.

### American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) national practice guideline for the use of medications in the treatment of addiction involving opioid use [^112q8rXV]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Switching from methadone to another medication for the treatment of opioid use disorder may be appropriate if the patient experiences intolerable side effects or is not successful in attaining or maintaining treatment goals through the use of methadone.

Patients switching from methadone to buprenorphine in the treatment of opioid use disorder should be on low doses of methadone before switching medications. Patients on low doses of methadone (30–40 mg per day or less) generally tolerate transition to buprenorphine with minimal discomfort, whereas patients on higher doses of methadone may experience significant discomfort in switching medications.

Patients switching from methadone to oral naltrexone or extended-release injectable naltrexone must be completely withdrawn from methadone and other opioids, before they can receive naltrexone. This may take up to 14 days, and a naloxone challenge may be useful in determining the lack of physical dependence on opioids. The only exception would apply when an experienced clinician receives consent from the patient to embark on a plan of naltrexone-facilitated opioid withdrawal management.

Patients who discontinue agonist therapy with methadone or buprenorphine and then resume opioid use should be made aware of the risks associated with opioid overdose, and especially the increased risk of death.

Part 5: Buprenorphine

Opioid-dependent patients should wait until they are experiencing mild to moderate opioid withdrawal before taking the first dose of buprenorphine to reduce the risk of precipitated withdrawal.

Induction of buprenorphine should start with a dose of 2–4 mg. Dosages may be increased in increments of 2–4 mg.

Clinicians should observe patients in their offices during induction. Emerging research suggests, however, that many patients need "not" be observed and that home buprenorphine induction may be considered. Home-based induction is recommended only if the patient or prescribing physician is experienced with the use of buprenorphine. This is based on the consensus opinion of the Guideline Committee.

Once it has been established that the initial dose is well tolerated, the buprenorphine dose can be increased fairly rapidly to a dose that provides stable effects for 24 hours and is clinically effective. Buprenorphine doses after induction and titration should be, on average, at least 8 mg per day. The US FDA approves dosing to a limit of 24 mg per day, and there is limited evidence regarding the relative efficacy of higher doses. In addition, the use of higher doses may increase the risk of diversion.

### Buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal among hospitalized patients using fentanyl [^112aAAdW]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, we used a retrospective cohort design with clinical data; this may introduce unobserved bias and confounding. Second, our sample size limited statistical power to detect small-magnitude associations between predefined factors and PW. Third, there was a high rate of missingness in documented COWS assessments both before and after buprenorphine administration. Fourth, we could not distinguish patients newly initiating buprenorphine from those continuing prior treatment, although the inclusion of patients continuing treatment would lead to underestimation of PW incidence for buprenorphine inductions. We examined the potential effects of these limitations by comparing observed characteristics of excluded patients with those of patients included in the final cohort and by reporting PW incidences across various cohorts and definitions of PW as sensitivity analyses.

Additionally, our data did not allow us to normalize fentanyl concentrations for urine dilution, and fentanyl itself might not be implicated in PW if higher urine fentanyl concentration is just a proxy for higher amount or frequency of opioid use. Future research should confirm the association of urine fentanyl concentration with PW while accounting for urine dilution. Finally, the focus of this study on patients in the ED or hospital may have limited generalizability to patients initiating buprenorphine at home; these patients might have less risk for PW given less severe co-occurring illness but potentially greater risk without direct clinical supervision.

### Diagnosis and treatment of presumed naltrexone-XR-precipitated opioid withdrawal in a patient chronically treated with buprenorphine-XR: a case report [^111HRQdt]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Naltrexone, buprenorphine, and methadone are Food and Drug Administration-approved medications for the treatment of opioid use disorder in the United States. Naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, can precipitate opioid withdrawal if administered too quickly after the use of full or partial opioid agonists for those with either dependence or use disorder. We describe a case of severe precipitated opioid withdrawal syndrome after reported buprenorphine extended-release (XR) administration, despite the patient having been stable on buprenorphine-XR for several years, with no missed doses or recent opioid use. Naltrexone levels were sent and helped to diagnose suspected inadvertent naltrexone-XR administration in this patient, which was likely the etiology of his precipitated opioid withdrawal syndrome. We suggest the use of high-dose buprenorphine, as well as adjunctive medications including benzodiazepines, as a treatment strategy for naltrexone-XR precipitated withdrawal in the setting of chronic buprenorphine-XR treatment.

### Point / counterpoint: should full agonist opioid medications be offered to hospitalized patients for management of opioid withdrawal? [^111KVUrq]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Opioid agonist therapy can be considered a bridge to several potential treatment pathways for hospitalized patients with OUD. For a patient who is initially reluctant to initiate MOUD, an alternate opioid agonist such as oxycodone or hydromorphone can be utilized to effectively manage pain and opioid withdrawal during the initial phase of hospitalization, buying time to revisit interest in MOUD when initial symptoms are better controlled. Regarding transition to buprenorphine, prescription oxycodone has a more predictable half-life than illicitly manufactured fentanyl, and when timed properly, the risk of precipitated opioid withdrawal during transitions from oxycodone to buprenorphine can be all but eliminated. For a patient interested in methadone treatment, oxycodone can be utilized to control pain and withdrawal symptoms until methadone can be titrated to effective dosing. What about the patient who is uninterested in MOUD? A patient with OUD and significant opioid dependence should not be required to accept MOUD to receive medical care, and treatment with opioid agonist therapies during a period of hospitalization can be considered a safe bridge to continued opioid use after discharge, protecting a patient's opioid tolerance as a form of harm reduction, and ultimately mitigating the risk of fatal overdose following hospitalization.

### Clinical case conference: strategies for transferring from methadone to buprenorphine [^113PbhPt]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The mainstay of treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) are medications, methadone (a full opioid agonist) or buprenorphine (a partial opioid agonist), in conjunction with psychosocial interventions. Both treatments are effective but safety, efficacy, and patient preference can lead to a decision to change from one treatment to the other. Transfer from buprenorphine to methadone is not clinically challenging; however, changing from methadone to buprenorphine is more complex. Published reports describe varied approaches to manage this transfer to both minimize patient symptoms associated with withdrawal from methadone and reduce risk of precipitating withdrawal symptoms with introduction of the partial agonist buprenorphine. There is no single approach for methadone to buprenorphine that is superior to others and no approach that is suitable for all case presentations. This case conference describes 3 different approaches to achieve a successful methadone to buprenorphine transfer and provides commentary on how the case may be managed based on published transfer "strategies".

### Incidence of precipitated withdrawal during a multisite emergency department-initiated buprenorphine clinical trial in the era of fentanyl [^113DX1bH]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Results

Among 1200 enrolled patients (800 men [66.7%]; mean [SD] age, 38.4 [12.0] years), there were 9 cases of PW, or 0.76% (95% CI, 0.35%-1.43%) of the overall sample. Patient characteristics (total and PW) are presented in Table 1. The PW cases were enrolled from diverse locations; 5 received sublingual buprenorphine and 4 received extended-release buprenorphine. Detailed data from the PW cases are reported in Table 2. All patients had urine tests positive for fentanyl, 7 with multiple drugs. Routes of use, changes in baseline and peak COWS scores, and time elapsed from buprenorphine administration to PW varied. Time since last use ranged from 8 to more than 24 hours. All patients experiencing PW were discharged after symptoms resolved, with 1 self-directed discharge. Follow-up rates at 7 days after the ED visit were 86%.

### Efficacy of transdermal buprenorphine patch for managing withdrawal symptoms in patients with cancer physically dependent on prescription opioids [^1178DPrr]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite its slower onset and lower dose flexibility than sublingual buprenorphine, TBP has compensatory advantages for managing withdrawal symptoms on prescribed opioids. The reduced risk of diversion owing to the controlled delivery system and favorable safety profile of TBP are beneficial in outpatient and long-term management settings. Continuous buprenorphine release of TBP ensures stable drug levels along with the convenience of non-daily dosing, which enhances patient compliance and adherence. Additionally, TBP does not require an opioid-free interval before rotation from the offending opioids because of its slow and steady release of medication, thus preventing precipitated withdrawal. However, our study predominantly involved participants with mild withdrawal symptoms, as indicated by a mean COWS score of 6. The lower success rate in more challenging cases, such as those involving short-acting, multiple, or potent opioids, suggests that TBP might be less effective in managing severe withdrawal symptoms. These patients may require immediate flexible symptom management. Additionally, the follow-up period in our study was relatively short. This shorter follow-up duration may have limited our ability to fully assess the long-term efficacy of TBP, potentially leading to an overestimation of its success rate in discontinuing prescribed opioids and an underestimation of the rate of resumption of prescribed opioids.

### Strategies for transfer from methadone to buprenorphine for treatment of opioid use disorders and associated outcomes: a systematic review [^112MksWZ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Precipitated Withdrawal

Precipitated withdrawal not attributable to a protocol violation was reported in 8 studies. However, the definitions and timing of "precipitated withdrawal" were often not well-described. Only 1 studyoperationally defined precipitated withdrawal: an increase in COWS score of 6 or more points, occurring within 6 hours of the first dose of sublingual buprenorphine. In this study, the proportion of patients experiencing precipitated withdrawal was 3/33 (9%) overall, with 3 cases reported in the high-dose group (3/15 [20%]) and none in low and moderate dose groups (between-groups P = not significant). Two of 3 cases noted above involved deviations from the study protocol.

Transfer Completion

Fifteen studies reported the number of patients who completed the transfer process, generally defined as achieving and maintaining a stable dose of buprenorphine, though the definition varied across individual studies. Transfer completion rates were generally high (Table 3; range 67%–100%; weighted mean 92%), with no trend by publication year.

Meta-analysis and meta-regression were considered but were deemed inadvisable due to several factors including (a) considerable heterogeneity among the included studies' designs, populations, and treatments; (b) the inherent interrelatedness of several of the transfer components; (c) the small number of patients in several studies; (d) the overall high level of transfer completion; and (e) the lack of any significant findings in one-way analyses of variance (see next paragraph).

Although some of the individual components of the transfer process were correlated at least moderately with transfer completion rate (Table 3), only 1 statistically significant association was found (Table 4). Stable (pretaper) methadone dose was negatively correlated with completion rate (Pearson r = −0.63), and the completion rate decreased from 98% at methadone doses less than 40 mg to 82% at methadone doses greater than 60 mg (P = 0.03). No other differences were statistically significant. In addition to the aforementioned results, both patients in the microdosing study completed the transfer.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^111P7sKo]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — pregnant women with opioid use disorder: Treatment with methadone or buprenorphine is recommended and should be initiated as early as possible during pregnancy, and pregnant women who are physiologically dependent on opioids should receive treatment using methadone or buprenorphine rather than withdrawal management or psychosocial treatment alone; care should be managed by clinicians experienced in obstetrical care and in the treatment of opioid use disorder, and hospitalization during initiation of methadone or buprenorphine may be advisable, especially in the third trimester. Methadone should be initiated at a dose range of 10–30 mg, with incremental doses of 5–10 mg recommended every 3–6 hours as needed to treat withdrawal symptoms, to a maximum first day dose of 30–40 mg; after initiation, clinicians should increase the methadone dose by no more than 5–10 mg approximately every 5 days. Clinicians should be aware that the pharmacokinetics of methadone are affected by pregnancy and increased or split doses may be needed as pregnancy progresses, with twice-daily dosing more effective and having fewer side effects than single dosing but potentially impractical because methadone is typically dispensed in an OTP. If a woman becomes pregnant while receiving naltrexone, it may be appropriate to discontinue the medication if the patient and clinician agree that the risk of relapse is low; a decision to remain on naltrexone should be carefully considered with discussion of the insufficiency of research on risks, and if discontinuation is chosen with relapse risk, treatment with methadone or buprenorphine should be considered. Use of naloxone to test for opioid dependence and risk of precipitated withdrawal is not recommended for pregnant women with opioid use disorder, and unless otherwise contraindicated, mothers receiving methadone or buprenorphine should be encouraged to breastfeed.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^115niESQ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — Buprenorphine indications, initiation, and dosing: Buprenorphine is a recommended treatment for patients with opioid use disorder who are able to give informed consent and have no specific contraindication, and for patients who are currently opioid dependent buprenorphine should not be initiated until there are objective signs of opioid withdrawal to reduce the risk of precipitated withdrawal. Once objective signs of withdrawal are observed, initiation should start with a dose of 2–4 mg and dosages may be increased in increments of 2–8 mg, with the initiation setting determined by clinical judgement because both office-based and home-based initiation are considered safe and effective when starting buprenorphine treatment. Following initiation, the buprenorphine dose should be titrated to alleviate symptoms to enable patients to discontinue illicit opioid use, evidence suggests that 16 mg per day or more may be more effective than lower doses, and there is limited evidence regarding the relative efficacy of doses higher than 24 mg per day with the use of higher doses potentially increasing the risk of diversion. The FDA recently approved several new buprenorphine formulations for treatment of opioid use disorder and, as effectiveness data are currently limited, clinicians should use these products as indicated and be mindful of emerging evidence as it becomes available. Patients' psychosocial needs should be assessed and patients should be offered or referred to psychosocial treatment based on their individual needs in conjunction with buprenorphine, but a patient's decision to decline psychosocial treatment or the absence of available psychosocial treatment should not preclude or delay buprenorphine treatment with appropriate medication management.

### Effectiveness of non-opioid interventions to reduce opioid withdrawal symptoms in patients with chronic pain: a systematic review [^115zd1pW]. Family Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Dealing with the opioid crisis, medical doctors are keen to learn how to best treat opioid dependency in patients with chronic non-cancer pain. Opioid replacement therapy is commonly used, but success rates vary widely. Since many patients still experience severe withdrawal symptoms, additional interventions are necessary.

Objective

To review the effectiveness of interventions in the treatment of withdrawal symptoms during opioid tapering or acute withdrawal in patients with long-term non-cancer pain.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted in Embase.com, MEDLINE, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and Cochrane CENTRAL register of trials. Studies eligible for inclusion were (non-)randomized controlled trials in adults with long-term opioid prescriptions for non-cancer pain. Included trials had to compare a non-opioid intervention to placebo, usual care, no treatment, or non-opioid drug and had to report on withdrawal symptoms as an outcome. Study quality was assessed with the 2.0 Cochrane risk of bias (RoB) tool. Evidence quality was rated following the GRADE approach.

Results

One trial (n = 21, some concerns regarding RoB) compared Varenicline to placebo. There was no statistically significant between-group reduction of withdrawal symptoms (moderate-quality evidence).

Conclusions

Evidence from clinical trials on interventions reducing withdrawal symptoms is scarce. Based on one trial with a small sample size, no firm conclusion can be drawn. Meanwhile, doctors are in dire need for therapeutic options to tackle withdrawal symptoms while tapering patients with prescription opioid dependence. We hope this review draws attention to this unfortunate research gap so that future research can provide doctors with answers.

### Buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal among hospitalized patients using fentanyl [^115PmRXY]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Buprenorphine treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) is safe, effective, and scalable under existing US federal regulations. Buprenorphine is a partial μ-opioid receptor agonist with high binding affinity; when introduced while a full-agonist opioid such as fentanyl or heroin is present, buprenorphine displaces the full agonist and can precipitate sudden opioid withdrawal. To prevent this phenomenon of precipitated withdrawal (PW), the traditional initiation approach is to administer successive doses of 2 to 4 mg of sublingual buprenorphine at least 8 to 16 hours after the last use of a short-acting opioid, once patients develop opioid withdrawal (typically assessed as a Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale [COWS] score ≥ 8 on a scale of 0–48, with higher scores indicating more severe opioid withdrawal). This approach quickly and effectively relieves opioid withdrawal, with a low rate of PW among individuals who use short-acting opioids such as heroin or oxycodone.

As fentanyl has adulterated or replaced heroin in the unregulated drug supply and as access to buprenorphine treatment has expanded, patient, and clinician, reports of buprenorphine PW have increased. Patients have described PW despite 48 hours of abstinence from fentanyl, and case series, have documented that some patients using fentanyl develop PW despite moderate opioid withdrawal (COWS score ≥ 13). Since fentanyl is detectable in urine for an average of 7 days after last use for persons with OUD, there is concern that fentanyl retained in adipose or skeletal muscle after chronic use might increase the risk of PW despite 8 to 48 hours of abstinence. Due to fear of PW, some patients using fentanyl now decline buprenorphine, and some clinicians use alternative buprenorphine initiation approaches such as low-dose initiation with opioid continuation.

### Treatment of acute naloxone-precipitated opioid withdrawal with buprenorphine [^116xtbmb]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Naloxone is a frequently utilized and effective treatment to reverse the life-threatening effects of illicit opioid intoxication. Excessive naloxone dosing in these circumstances, however, may lead to naloxone-precipitated opioid withdrawal in individuals with opioid dependence. Buprenorphine, a partial mu-opioid agonist, is increasingly utilized in the Emergency Department (ED) for the treatment of opioid withdrawal syndrome but little is known regarding its utility in cases of naloxone-precipitated opioid withdrawal. We report a case of naloxone-precipitated opioid withdrawal that was effectively treated with sublingual buprenorphine. An older male was brought into the ED with signs and symptoms of opioid toxicity that was successfully treated with pre-hospital naloxone by Emergency Medical Services. He had a clinical opioid withdrawal scale (COWS) or 10 with abdominal cramping and unintentional defecation. After a discussion of treatment options and possible adverse effects with the patient, the decision was made to administer 4 mg/1 mg of sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone film. The patient reported a rapid improvement in symptoms and at 30 min posttreatment, his COWS was 4. His COWS decreased to 3 at 1 h and this was sustained for 4 h of observation. The patient was subsequently discharged to a treatment facility for opioid use disorder. This case highlights the potential of buprenorphine as a treatment modality for acute naloxone-precipitated opioid withdrawal. Due to the risks of worsening or sustained buprenorphine-precipitated opioid withdrawal, further research is warranted to identify patients who may benefit from this therapy.

### Precipitated withdrawal during maintenance opioid blockade with extended release naltrexone [^111eML3R]. Addiction (2008). Low credibility.

Background There has been increasing interest in the use of extended release injectable naltrexone for the treatment of opioid dependence. Case description We report a case of precipitated withdrawal in a 17-year-old adolescent female receiving extended release naltrexone (Vivitrol) for opioid dependence, following her third serial monthly dose of the medication, several days after using oxycodone with mild intoxication. Conclusions This case suggests that, in some circumstances, the opioid blockade may be overcome when naltrexone levels drop towards the end of the dosing interval, producing vulnerability to subsequent naltrexone-induced withdrawal. This may provide cautionary guidance for clinical management and dosing strategies.

### Effectiveness of non-opioid interventions to reduce opioid withdrawal symptoms in patients with chronic pain: a systematic review [^1161Yu72]. Family Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Implications for research and practice

Finding ourselves in the midst of a prescription opioid crisis, it is of utmost importance to help our patients to withdraw from these drugs. It is our task as researchers and physicians to do everything we can to help these patients and develop the most effective treatments in conquering their prescription opioid dependence. Reducing severe withdrawal symptoms that occur during opioid tapering, opioid replacement therapy, or abrupt withdrawal may lead to higher efficacy of these interventions and may help patients to pursue complete abstinence. This systematic review has clearly highlighted the lack of (randomized) controlled trials on this topic.

Therefore, it is no surprise that protocols on treating withdrawal in patient tapering off LTOT for GPs are scarce. Some guidelines and handbooks on tapering opioids in patients on LTOT for CNCP offer some examples of non-opioid pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment options but these proposed interventions are based on expert opinion, anecdotal reports, and evidence from trials on treating withdrawal in heroin and methadone addiction.

For now, GPs only have these recommendations when treating withdrawal symptoms in patients tapering LTOT. However, to improve our care and develop evidence-based protocols for treating opioid-dependent CNCP patients we need more research on prescription opioids. Not only on how to taper opioids or on opioid replacement therapy, but also on how to address withdrawal symptoms with non-opioid treatments that can be used in primary care.

### Recognition and management of iatrogenically induced opioid dependence and withdrawal in children [^114AjUx2]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Opioids are often prescribed to children for pain relief related to procedures, acute injuries, and chronic conditions. Round-the-clock dosing of opioids can produce opioid dependence within 5 days. According to a 2001 Consensus Paper from the American Academy of Pain Medicine, American Pain Society, and American Society of Addiction Medicine, dependence is defined as "a state of adaptation that is manifested by a drug class specific withdrawal syndrome that can be produced by abrupt cessation, rapid dose reduction, decreasing blood level of the drug, and/or administration of an antagonist". Although the experience of many children undergoing iatrogenically induced withdrawal may be mild or goes unreported, there is currently no guidance for recognition or management of withdrawal for this population. Guidance on this subject is available only for adults and primarily for adults with substance use disorders. The guideline will summarize existing literature and provide readers with information currently not available in any single source specific for this vulnerable pediatric population.

### Evaluation of buprenorphine rotation in patients receiving long-term opioids for chronic pain: a systematic review [^117ELxxV]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Data Extraction, Quality Assessment, and Synthesis

Data extracted included study design, pain characteristics, length of time using opioids, and baseline opioid dose. Outcomes of rotation to buprenorphine included precipitated opioid withdrawal, pain intensity or severity, pain interference, treatment success (eg, completion of protocol, willingness to continue buprenorphine long term, and reduced interest in additional opioids), mental health condition (eg, depression and insomnia), AEs or adverse effects, and health care use (eg, hospitalizations and outpatient visits). We focused on withdrawal symptoms precipitated by initiation of buprenorphine rather than by discontinuation of the original opioid (if that distinction could be made). We also extracted details regarding buprenorphine conversion protocols, including length of time between the most recent baseline opioid dose and the initial buprenorphine administration, dose, formulation, and frequency (eg, twice daily).

Risk of bias and study quality were assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration toolfor randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scalefor cohort and case-control studies. All uncontrolled observational studies (ie, pre-post studies) were considered to have inherently high risk of bias. Data were synthesized using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteriafor each outcome. Heterogeneity precluded quantitative meta-analysis.

### Guidelines for managing substance withdrawal in jails [^116LfNjw]. NIC/BJA (2023). High credibility.

Buprenorphine initiation thresholds using COWS — the COWS assessment can be helpful in determining if patients are experiencing mild to moderate withdrawal; in community settings, a score of 11–12 is typically indicative of sufficient withdrawal to initiate buprenorphine, but the EC has observed underscoring of the COWS in jail settings such that some jails initiate buprenorphine with a COWS score of 6 or more. Use of COWS will be more effective when jails periodically evaluate how often patients are experiencing significant withdrawal signs/symptoms and how often patients are experiencing precipitated withdrawal, adjusting threshold protocols accordingly; if patients are experiencing significant withdrawal before buprenorphine is initiated, initiation should be triggered by a lower COWS score, and if initiation protocols are leading to precipitated withdrawal, initiation should be triggered by a higher COWS score.

### Buprenorphine-an attractive opioid with underutilized potential in treatment of chronic pain [^116WEuBa]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Abuse potential and withdrawal

Buprenorphine is a partial agonist and has fewer rewarding effects compared to another μ-agonists and blocks psychological dependence. Despite these properties, there have been reports of abuse particularly by new users. To counter potential misuse, a combination of buprenorphine with the opioid antagonist naloxone in a ratio of 4 to 1, has been used in sublingual administration. Naloxone has poor bioavailability (approximately 3%) on sublingual dosing. Thus, when the buprenorphine/naloxone tablet is taken in sublingual form, the buprenorphine opioid agonist effect predominates, and the naloxone does not precipitate opioid withdrawal in the opioid-addicted user. Naloxone via the parenteral route, however, has good bioavailability. If the sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone tablets are crushed and injected by an opioid-addicted individual, the naloxone effect predominates and can precipitate the opioid withdrawal syndrome.

Typically, the withdrawal syndrome following the abrupt cessation of long-term buprenorphine treatment emerges within 3–5 days of the last dose, and mild withdrawal features continue for up to several weeks. Treatment with opioid antagonist (naloxone) can be commenced within days of the cessation of low dose buprenorphine treatment without precipitating severe opioid withdrawal. This enables patients to transfer promptly to naloxone treatment, and avoid relapse and treatment drop-out.

A summary of comparative safety profile of buprenor-phine with other opioids is captured in Table 3.

Recommendation O-5 advises that "If a patient treated with buprenorphine or methadone for presumed opioid withdrawal does not respond to treatment, the qualified health care professional should consider whether the dose needs to be increased or if the patient may have been misdiagnosed", and that the "Differential diagnosis should include serious illnesses that can mimic the signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal including withdrawal from other substances, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolus, respiratory infection, severe abdominal infection, diabetic ketoacidosis, sepsis, and thyrotoxicosis, among others".

### Reddit discussions about buprenorphine associated precipitated withdrawal in the era of fentanyl [^114HKowa]. Clinical Toxicology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 Background

Buprenorphine (Suboxone ®, a combination of buprenorphine and naloxone) is an effective, evidence-based treatment for patients with opioid use disorder (OUD). Buprenorphine has unique pharmacologic properties: it is a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist and has very high affinity for the mu-opioid receptor. Therefore, to avoid buprenorphine from displacing lower affinity, full agonist opioids (e.g. heroin) from the opioid receptor and causing withdrawal, patients seeking buprenorphine treatment must wait until they start experiencing withdrawal before initiating standard dosing regimens. If buprenorphine is initiated prior to withdrawal onset, it can displace residual opioids, causing an uncomfortable and sometimes severe acute withdrawal syndrome known as precipitated opioid withdrawal (POW). POW has been defined as an increase in the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS), which measures the signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, of 6 or more while initiating buprenorphine. Fear of POW poses a barrier to both clinicians and patients to buprenorphine initiation.

Multiple recently published reports suggest that POW can occur even after waiting the recommended amount of time in patients with a history of heavy fentanyl use. It has been proposed that this phenomenon may occur due to the high lipophilicity of fentanyl, resulting in a long tail of elimination after chronic use. One study showed that in patients with OUD and chronic fentanyl use, urinary metabolites of fentanyl could be detected 2–3 weeks after last use when hospitalized in a treatment program. Additional risk of severe POW could be related to the dose or length of use of full opioid agonist used prior to buprenorphine induction, time interval to receiving buprenorphine, and other comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions that alter metabolism of opioids or symptoms of POW. One potential alternative approach to avoid POW is microdosing, which involves overlapping induction of buprenorphine in very small escalating doses while still using full agonist opioids. The "Bernese Method" is one such method, although several different regimens have been described in the medical literature. While the literature on this subject is growing, many people with OUD have discovered these methods through their own lived experiences.

### Evaluation of buprenorphine rotation in patients receiving long-term opioids for chronic pain: a systematic review [^114cSHe2]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

We systematically reviewed the literature regarding rotation to buprenorphine in individuals with chronic pain who used LTOT. We found 22 studies that evaluated at least 1 prespecified outcome. Although most studies had a high risk of bias, limiting the strength of the present study's conclusions, several important findings emerged.

Buprenorphine appeared to be not inferior to full MOR agonists in controlling pain. Continuing buprenorphine rather than tapering it off was associated with higher rates of protocol completion and lower use of additional opioids. Although many approaches to buprenorphine rotation are available, most studies relied on protocols that were adapted from those that are used to induct patients with OUD to buprenorphine, which require that opioid withdrawal symptoms be present before the administration of the first dose of buprenorphine. Previous studies also supported the safety of buprenorphine. Severe AEs were rare, and the adverse effects, although more common, were manageable. The incidence of precipitated opioid withdrawal was low (3%-6%).

We believe that this systematic review adds to the growing body of literature that suggests that buprenorphine is safe to use in multiple populations, including those with opioid dependence and chronic pain. In contrast, long-term full MOR agonists present significant risks for harmful or fatal overdose, all-cause mortality, and morbidity. Thus, this synthesis supports the hypothesis that rotation from full MOR agonists to buprenorphine would reduce harm, although more research is needed into the best way to complete such rotation.

Rotation to buprenorphine was not associated with changes to patients' pain control. In most studies, buprenorphine was associated with reduced pain severity, although the mechanism for this finding is not clear. It is possible that opioid rotation in general (through incomplete cross-tolerance to a different opioid), rather than rotation to buprenorphine specifically, was a factor. Alternatively, reduced pain might be associated with buprenorphine's unique role in opioid-induced hyperalgesia. Previous studies have reported the antihyperalgesic outcomes of buprenorphine compared with other full MOR agonists in animal models and in humans.

### Buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal among hospitalized patients using fentanyl [^112Wrfga]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Buprenorphine treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) is safe and effective, but opioid withdrawal during treatment initiation is associated with poor retention in care. As fentanyl has replaced heroin in the drug supply, case reports and surveys have indicated increased concern for buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal (PW); however, some observational studies have found a low incidence of PW.

Objective

To estimate buprenorphine PW incidence and assess factors associated with PW among emergency department (ED) or hospitalized patients.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study at 3 academic hospitals in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, included adults with OUD who underwent traditional or high-dose buprenorphine initiation between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021. Exclusion criteria included low-dose buprenorphine initiation and missing documentation of opioid withdrawal severity within 4 hours of receiving buprenorphine.

Exposure

Buprenorphine initiation with an initial dose of at least 2 mg of sublingual buprenorphine after a Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) score of 8 or higher. Additional exposures included 4 predefined factors potentially associated with PW: severity of opioid withdrawal before buprenorphine (COWS score of 8–12 vs ≥ 13), initial buprenorphine dose (2 vs 4 or ≥ 8 mg), body mass index (BMI) (< 25 vs 25 to < 30 or ≥ 30; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), and urine fentanyl concentration (0 to < 20 vs 20 to < 200 or ≥ 200 ng/mL).

Main Outcome and Measures

The main outcome was PW incidence, defined as a 5-point or greater increase in COWS score from immediately before to within 4 hours after buprenorphine initiation. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of PW associated with the 4 aforementioned predefined factors.

Results

The cohort included 226 patients (150 [66.4%] male; mean [SD] age, 38.6 [10.8] years). Overall, 26 patients (11.5%) met criteria for PW. Among patients with PW, median change in COWS score was 9 points (IQR, 6–13 points). Of 123 patients with confirmed fentanyl use, 20 (16.3%) had PW. In unadjusted and adjusted models, BMI of 30 or greater compared with less than 25 (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 5.12; 95% CI, 1.31–19.92) and urine fentanyl concentration of 200 ng/mL or greater compared with less than 20 ng/mL (AOR, 8.37; 95% CI, 1.60–43.89) were associated with PW.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this retrospective cohort study, 11.5% of patients developed PW after buprenorphine initiation in ED or hospital settings. Future studies should confirm the rate of PW and assess whether bioaccumulated fentanyl is a risk factor for PW.

### Opioid withdrawal precipitated by long-acting antagonists [^114Lqgja]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Precipitated opioid withdrawal (POW) after opioid antagonist administration can be challenging to manage in the emergency department (ED), particularly if caused by a long-acting opioid antagonist such as naltrexone. There are no evidence-based guidelines to assist in safely and efficiently managing patients with this syndrome.

Objective Of Review

To review current practice on the treatment of long-acting antagonist POW and make recommendations on the treatment of this complex disease process.

Methods

A literature search of opioid withdrawal cases precipitated by naltrexone was done using PubMed. One of the authors screened all the results of this search by title and abstract, leading to a final count of 27 articles that were reviewed in full by all authors. English language cases that involved precipitated opioid withdrawal from a long-acting opioid antagonist were included. Data were extracted, including the precipitant involved and dose, severity of opioid withdrawal, treatments rendered, and response to treatment. In all cases where symptoms and signs were described, a Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale score was calculated based on the information available.

Results

Twenty-seven papers were included. Naltrexone alone was the primary antagonist reported in 19 of the papers, extended-release naltrexone in two, naltrexone-morphine combination in two, and nalmefene in four. Treatment most commonly included fluid replacement, benzodiazepines, antiemetics, and clonidine. Full opioid agonist treatment, although often suggested, was poorly described. Buprenorphine successfully reduced the severity and duration of withdrawal in several cases. No standardized response scale was used, and response to treatment ranged from 3 to 48 h prior to resolution of clinical effects.

Conclusions

Management of POW from long-acting antagonists is a complex problem with little formal evaluation of treatment options. There is not currently a sufficiently robust body of literature to support an evidence-based guideline. However, use of intravenous fluids, antiemetics, and benzodiazepines is commonly reported as successful and seems to be a reasonable approach until this process is better studied. A treatment strategy using partial agonists such as buprenorphine is emerging and may represent a safe and effective treatment pathway for these patients.

### Guidelines for managing substance withdrawal in jails [^117WtX8o]. NIC/BJA (2023). High credibility.

Monitoring patients during withdrawal management — jail-based opioid withdrawal — states that opioid withdrawal symptom severity should be monitored with a validated tool, such as the COWS. To support management of opioid use, it is recommended that jails, at minimum, have staff who are well-trained to administer the COWS available at all times, a provider authorized to prescribe buprenorphine on staff, under contract, or under a memorandum of understanding, and, when feasible, direct affiliation with a methadone treatment provider to provide access to methadone. Custody staff may be trained to effectively administer the COWS, including collection of vital signs. The withdrawal severity score should gradually decrease following medication initiation; an increasing score following buprenorphine initiation may indicate precipitated withdrawal and should trigger an immediate medical assessment, and monitoring should only be discontinued upon a patient-specific order from the prescriber based on clinical evaluation and determination that it is safe to do so. Monitoring intervals should be determined by a qualified health care professional based on the anticipated timing and severity of withdrawal for the individual patient, with patients who report use of a short-acting opioid monitored using the COWS at least every 4 hours and patients who report using long-acting opioids monitored using the COWS at least every 8 hours. In patients with concurrent sedative use disorder or withdrawal, methadone or buprenorphine should be used to stabilize withdrawal from opioids.

5.4	Risk of Opioid Overdose from Attempts to Overcome the Blockade

ZURNAI is unlikely to produce acute withdrawal symptoms in non-opioid dependent patients. The use of ZURNAI in patients who are opioid dependent may precipitate opioid withdrawal. Attempting to overcome opioid withdrawal symptoms caused by opioid antagonists with high or repeated doses of exogenous opioids could lead to opioid intoxication and death.

Inform patients of the potential consequences of trying to overcome the opioid blockade. Get emergency medical assistance as soon as possible after use of ZURNAI regardless of withdrawal symptoms.

### Effectiveness of non-opioid interventions to reduce opioid withdrawal symptoms in patients with chronic pain: a systematic review [^115xfBEx]. Family Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The current shortage of well-conducted randomized controlled trials and the continuing rise of patients with prescription opioid dependence must be a stimulus for future research. To keep the problem attainable, expand treatment options and encourage more doctors to guide patients during an opioid taper more research is necessary.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^111ZBJTc]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite potential harms, long-term use of BZDs (i.e. ≥ 120 days) is common. Long-term BZD use is associated with an increased risk of physical dependence and withdrawal and ongoing risk of adverse events such as falls, motor vehicle accidents, and cognitive impairment.– Evidence also suggests that use of BZDs is associated with increased suicide risk, although the mechanism for this association is not well understood. The risk–benefit balance for continued BZD use may shift over time, and stopping can be challenging because physical dependence develops with regular use. It should be noted that physical dependence is an expected outcome associated with the use of prescribed BZDs and is distinct from substance use disorders (SUDs; see Box 1). Older adults (i.e. ≥ 65 years old) have the highest BZD prescription rates and are at higher risk of experiencing adverse events related to BZD use. Some older adults have taken BZDs continuously for decades. In some instances, use has been so prolonged that the original reason for the BZD prescription may be unclear.

Box 1
Physical Dependence Versus Substance Use Disorder

Safe tapering of BZDs can be clinically complex because rapid dosage reductions may precipitate acute withdrawal, which can be life-threatening. Patients are also at risk of recurrence and exacerbation of the symptoms for which BZDs were initially prescribed (e.g. anxiety, seizures, insomnia) and destabilization. This Guideline was motivated, in part, by patients reporting harms associated with too rapid tapering/discontinuation of BZD medications. Inadequate tapering strategies may push patients to the illegal drug market, where counterfeit pills laced with fentanyl and other highly potent synthetic opioids (HPSOs) are common, presenting an increased risk of overdose and overdose death. This Guideline aims to help clinicians in diverse practice settings determine whether and how to taper BZD medications.

Intersection with the Opioid Overdose Epidemic

Co-prescribing of BZDs and opioids quadrupled between 2003 and 2015 in ambulatory care settings, with data from 2014 to 2016 indicating over one-third of BZD prescriptions were co-prescribed with opioids. In addition, some individuals may concomitantly take BZDs and opioids to augment the effects of both substances.

Given that both BZDs and opioids cause CNS depression, concomitant use increases the risk of adverse events, including fatal and nonfatal overdose. – In 2021, 13.7% of overdose deaths in the USA involving opioids also involved BZDs, and nearly 88% of overdose deaths involving BZDs also involved opioids.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^114U7e9y]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, more specifically with respect to withdrawal management, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to do not initiate opioid withdrawal management with buprenorphine until there are objective signs of opioid withdrawal. Administer a dose of buprenorphine sufficient to suppress withdrawal symptoms (an initial dose of 2–4 mg titrated up as needed to suppress withdrawal symptoms) once signs of withdrawal have been objectively confirmed.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^1176brrG]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

More rapid tapers might be needed for patient safety under certain circumstances (e.g. for patients who have experienced overdose on their current dosage). However, unless there are indications of a life-threatening issue, such as warning signs of impending overdose, opioid therapy should not be discontinued abruptly, and clinicians should not rapidly reduce opioid dosages from higher dosages. Sudden discontinuation might precipitate substantial opioid withdrawal. Rapid tapering or sudden discontinuation of opioids in physically dependent patients also can increase risks for psychological distress and opioid-related emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Ultrarapid detoxification under anesthesia is associated with substantial risks, including death, and should not be used.

Management of Opioid Withdrawal During Tapering

The first approach to withdrawal symptoms and signs should generally be consideration of slowing or pausing the taper rate. If needed, short-term oral medications might also help manage withdrawal symptoms. These include alpha-2 agonists for the management of autonomic signs and symptoms (e.g. sweating and tachycardia). Alpha-2 agonists clonidine and lofexidine are more effective than placebo in reducing severity of withdrawal from heroin or methadone in the context of abrupt (not gradual) discontinuation. Similar research could not be found on clonidine and lofexidine in patients tapering from long-term opioid treatment for pain; however, alpha-2 agonist tizanidine has been used to help taper patients from long-term, high-dosage opioids for chronic pain. Other medications addressing specific symptoms (NSAIDs, acetaminophen, or topical menthol or methyl salicylate for muscle aches; trazodone for sleep disturbance; prochlorperazine, promethazine, or ondansetron for nausea; dicyclomine for abdominal cramping; and loperamide or bismuth subsalicylate for diarrhea) also have been used.

### Incidence of buprenorphine-precipitated opioid withdrawal in adults with opioid use disorder: a systematic review [^114zM387]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Buprenorphine is an evidence-based treatment for opioid use disorder, and the risk of precipitated withdrawal contributes to its underuse. The goal of this systematic review was to determine the incidence of buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal in adults with opioid use disorder.

Methods

This systematic review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023437634). We searched Medline, Embase Classic + Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL from inception to 10 November 2023, and included original research that reported the incidence of sublingual buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal in adults with opioid use disorder. Primary screening was completed by four independent reviewers. Full text review, data extraction and risk of bias assessments using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale and the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool were completed by two independent reviewers. The primary outcome was precipitated withdrawal. Secondary outcomes were baseline opioids used, induction dose, initial Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) score, location of induction, definition and severity of precipitated withdrawal and adverse events. The range of incidence of precipitated withdrawal across studies was described.

Results

Our search yielded 10197 unique citations. Twenty-one cohort and five randomized trials met inclusion criteria (n = 4497, range 20–1293). The overall incidence of precipitated withdrawal ranged from 0 to 13.2%. Nine studies defined precipitated withdrawal; definitions were inconsistent. Most patients used heroin at baseline. The most common initial dose of buprenorphine was between 2 mg and 8 mg (range: 0.075mg-24mg). Initial minimum COWS score ranged from 5 to 13. Induction locations included home, inpatient, emergency department, pre-hospital, outpatient and residential units. Of the fifteen studies with cases of precipitated withdrawal, nine studies did not report the severity of withdrawal experienced. Other induction-related adverse events varied. The overall quality of included studies was poor.

Conclusions

The best available evidence suggests the incidence of buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal in adults with opioid use disorder is low and should not be a barrier to use.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^115PdTZb]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — opioid withdrawal course and precipitated withdrawal are defined with timing by opioid half-life. The withdrawal syndrome includes craving, anxiety, dysphoria, yawning, sweating, piloerection (gooseflesh), lacrimation (excessive tear formation), rhinorrhea (runny nose), insomnia, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, cramps, muscle aches, and fever. With short-acting drugs, such as morphine or heroin, withdrawal symptoms may appear within 8–12 hours of the last dose of the drug, reach a peak at 48–72 hours, and clear after 7–10 days. With longer-acting drugs, such as methadone, onset of withdrawal symptoms may not occur until 1–3 days after the last dose; symptoms peak between the third and eighth day and may persist for several weeks. Precipitated withdrawal is a condition that occurs when an opioid agonist is displaced from the opioid receptor by an antagonist or partial agonist and the patient develops rapid withdrawal.
