## Question

Evaluation of pulsatile tinnitus with a negative carotid ultrasound — what are the next steps? Should a brain CT angiography be obtained?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate pulsatile tinnitus when the carotid duplex ultrasound is negative and whether brain CT angiography should be obtained. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true pulse-synchronous tinnitus and completing a meticulous history, audiology, and otoscopic exam. Then, I should verify why a negative carotid ultrasound does not exclude important arterial or venous causes. Next, I will determine the imaging pathway based on otoscopy findings. After that, I need to choose between CTA/CTV of the head and neck versus MRI/MRA/MRV, considering diagnostic yield, safety, and patient factors. Finally, I should synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant recommendation and note when catheter angiography is warranted if noninvasive imaging is unrevealing but suspicion remains high [^11353XiU] [^115fh5BT] [^112WNEU5].

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem correctly before jumping to imaging. I need to ensure the tinnitus is pulse-synchronous and not continuous, because pulsatile tinnitus almost always warrants imaging and may signal treatable vascular disease, whereas nonpulsatile tinnitus follows a different diagnostic pathway. I should confirm this at the bedside with careful history, auscultation over the ear, mastoid, neck, and orbits, document blood pressure, and perform a focused neurologic exam, and I should not skip otoscopy because imaging choice hinges on whether a retrotympanic vascular-appearing lesion is present. I also need to obtain baseline audiometry early because it influences the differential and subsequent testing. Hold on, let me verify guideline alignment: AAO-HNSF emphasizes audiologic evaluation up front and reserves imaging for specific triggers like pulsatile tinnitus, and both ACR and ESR stress that exam and otoscopy guide the imaging modality, which reassures me that this stepwise approach is sound [^1174QBrK] [^114Lur98] [^112WNEU5] [^115fh5BT] [^115uyJ27].

> Next, I should review why a negative carotid ultrasound does not close the case. Carotid duplex is limited to the extracranial carotid bifurcation and misses intracranial carotid segments, vertebral arteries, venous sinuses, and temporal bone pathology, and its sensitivity and specificity vary by lab and lesion severity with meaningful false negatives for clinically significant stenosis; importantly, carotid or vertebral dissections and fibromuscular dysplasia can be sonographically occult early or when distal, so relying on duplex alone risks underdiagnosis. I need to double-check the evidence: community and systematic data show variable accuracy and nontrivial false negative rates, and even guideline bodies suggest adjunct cross-sectional angiography when decisions depend on comprehensive cerebrovascular assessment. So, a negative carotid duplex should never terminate the pulsatile tinnitus workup if clinical suspicion persists [^113Dfs6D] [^1146Vjhu] [^116179sh] [^115BLsWw] [^114vpRGM].

> Now, I will determine the imaging branch based on otoscopy. If I see a retrotympanic lesion or conductive pattern suggestive of middle ear or jugular bulb pathology, high-resolution temporal bone CT is the correct next step to characterize glomus tumors, aberrant carotid artery, dehiscent jugular bulb, or persistent stapedial artery, with targeted CTA as needed for vascular characterization. Wait, let me verify I'm not over-ordering: ACR specifically recommends temporal bone CT first in suspected retrotympanic vascular lesions and then adjunct vascular imaging if indicated, which aligns with this pathway [^1129JRm4] [^112WNEU5].

> If otoscopy is normal, I need to move to comprehensive vascular imaging. Hold on, I should verify whether brain-only angiography suffices; it does not. ACR advises obtaining a combination of parenchymal and vascular imaging that evaluates both arterial and venous systems, with either head or head-and-neck CTA combined with CT venography from skull base through the neck, or MRI of the brain combined with MRA and MRV, because venous sinus stenosis, sigmoid sinus wall anomalies, dural AVFs, and arterial lesions outside the carotid bifurcation are common culprits in this scenario. ESR echoes that most patients with pulsatile tinnitus require CT or MRI with both arterial and venous imaging after clinical stratification, which confirms the need for comprehensive coverage beyond the carotid bifurcation [^11353XiU] [^112WNEU5] [^115fh5BT].

> I will now examine the choice between CTA/CTV of the head and neck versus MRI/MRA/MRV. CTA/CTV offers high spatial resolution, evaluates bone and venous sinus wall dehiscence or diverticula well, and rapidly surveys arterial and venous pathways in one sitting with thin collimation and venous phase; preliminary and subsequent series show meaningful diagnostic yields for PT causes including venous variants and stenoses. MRI/MRA/MRV avoids radiation, excels at soft tissue and intramural hematoma for dissection, and detects dural AV shunts and tumors, with reported sensitivity around 80% and specificity near 88% in small series; however, it is longer and may be limited by implants or claustrophobia. Let me reconsider the protocol details to avoid a mistake: for CTA, I should include head and neck with venous phase; for MRI, I should include brain MRI plus head-and-neck MRA and MRV, not just a brain MRA, to avoid missing extracranial contributors, which aligns with ACR. Either pathway is acceptable first-line when otoscopy is normal, and local expertise and patient factors should guide selection [^1134gHyD] [^112SmDfQ] [^112Ycsnb] [^11353XiU] [^112WNEU5] [^115fh5BT].

> But wait, what if specific clinical clues steer me. Objective tinnitus with an audible bruit or relief with jugular compression increases the odds of a vascular etiology, steering toward comprehensive angiographic imaging; postural variation, obesity, headaches, and transient visual obscurations point toward idiopathic intracranial hypertension with frequent lateral sinus stenosis or sigmoid sinus wall anomalies, for which venous phase imaging is crucial. I should also not forget systemic contributors such as anemia or hyperthyroidism and order targeted labs like CBC and TSH when appropriate, and consider FMD in younger patients, especially women with cervical bruit or headache, where carotid and distal segment disease can be missed by duplex but detected by cross-sectional angiography. I should double-check that these associations are evidence-based, and indeed they are supported across neurology and vascular literature as well as registry data [^111evAVQ] [^1179exKi] [^111wXfVK] [^11353XiU] [^115fh5BT].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without acknowledging a common pitfall. My first instinct might be to order a brain CTA alone after a negative carotid duplex, but I should correct that impulse: limiting the field to the brain risks missing critical cervical or skull base pathology, so the study must encompass head and neck with arterial and venous phases or be paired MRI/MRA/MRV that evaluates both systems from skull base through the circle of Willis and cervical segments. If noninvasive imaging is nondiagnostic and suspicion for a dural AV fistula remains high because of objective bruit, disabling symptoms, or progressive course, catheter angiography can be considered to definitively exclude a shunt, though ESR notes conventional angiography is now rarely needed when cross-sectional angiography is high quality [^11353XiU] [^115fh5BT] [^116mmKTr].

> Synthesis and direct answer: Yes, proceed with advanced vascular imaging despite a negative carotid ultrasound, and specify either head-and-neck CTA with a dedicated venous phase (CTV) or MRI of the brain plus MRA and MRV, chosen based on patient factors and local expertise. I need to ensure otoscopy is normal before picking this pathway; if a retrotympanic lesion is present, I should pivot first to high-resolution temporal bone CT and then add vascular imaging if indicated. I should confirm that this is guideline-concordant, and ACR and ESR clearly endorse comprehensive arterial and venous imaging for pulsatile tinnitus without a retrotympanic lesion, while also emphasizing that carotid ultrasound alone is insufficient for etiologic exclusion, which closes the loop on the negative duplex question. If these studies are unrevealing but clinical suspicion persists, selective catheter angiography can be considered to rule out a subtle dural AV fistula [^11353XiU] [^112WNEU5] [^115fh5BT] [^115BLsWw] [^114vpRGM].

---

After a negative carotid ultrasound in pulsatile tinnitus, the next step is **MRI/MRA of the brain and neck** [^11353XiU] to evaluate intracranial and skull base vascular lesions, including dural arteriovenous fistulas, venous sinus stenosis, and paragangliomas [^112Ycsnb]. If MRI/MRA is inconclusive or contraindicated, **CTA of the head and neck** [^112SmDfQ] is an appropriate alternative to assess arterial and venous structures and bony abnormalities [^115fh5BT]. CT angiography of the brain alone is not recommended, as it may miss key extracranial or skull base causes. If noninvasive imaging is negative but clinical suspicion remains high, consider **digital subtraction angiography** [^112uTyZB].

---

## Rationale for further imaging after negative carotid ultrasound

Carotid ultrasound assesses extracranial carotid disease [^114vpRGM] but not intracranial arteries, venous sinuses, or skull base structures — common causes of pulsatile tinnitus [^112uTyZB]. Therefore, **further imaging is necessary** to identify these etiologies [^1146Vjhu].

---

## Recommended next imaging modality: MRI/MRA of the brain and neck

MRI/MRA is the **preferred next imaging modality** [^11353XiU] following a negative carotid ultrasound because it comprehensively evaluates intracranial and extracranial vasculature, venous sinuses, and soft tissues without ionizing radiation [^115fh5BT]. MRI/MRA can identify:

- **Dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs)**: Common vascular causes of pulsatile tinnitus [^112Ycsnb].

- **Venous sinus stenosis or thrombosis**: Often associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) [^111evAVQ] and pulsatile tinnitus [^112Fup46].

- **Paragangliomas (glomus tumors)**: Vascular tumors frequently causing pulsatile tinnitus [^112WNEU5] [^112Ycsnb].

- **Other vascular anomalies**: Including aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, and vascular loops [^112Ycsnb].

MRI/MRA has high sensitivity and specificity for these conditions, making it the **most appropriate next step** in the diagnostic evaluation.

---

## Alternative imaging modality: CTA head and neck

If MRI/MRA is contraindicated or inconclusive, **CTA of the head and neck is an appropriate alternative** [^1134gHyD] [^112SmDfQ] that provides detailed visualization of arterial and venous structures, including:

- **Arterial abnormalities**: Such as aneurysms, dissections, and stenosis [^1134gHyD].

- **Venous anomalies**: Including venous sinus stenosis, diverticula, and dehiscence [^112SmDfQ] [^111evAVQ].

- **Bony abnormalities**: Such as sigmoid sinus wall dehiscence and jugular bulb anomalies [^112SmDfQ] [^115fh5BT].

CTA is **particularly useful** for evaluating bony structures and calcified lesions that may be less well visualized on MRI [^115fh5BT].

---

## Limitations of CTA brain alone

CTA of the brain alone is **not recommended** [^11353XiU] as the next step because it does not adequately evaluate extracranial vessels, venous sinuses, or skull base abnormalities — common causes of pulsatile tinnitus. Therefore, CTA of the head and neck or MRI/MRA of the brain and neck are preferred.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

The American College of Radiology (ACR) **Appropriateness Criteria recommend** [^11353XiU] obtaining combined parenchymal and vascular imaging — either CTA of the head/head and neck or a combination of head and internal auditory canal MRI, MRA, and/or head MRV — in patients with pulsatile tinnitus and no retrotympanic lesion on otoscopy. This approach ensures comprehensive evaluation of potential vascular and nonvascular causes [^114Lur98].

---

## Summary of recommended imaging sequence

| **Imaging modality** | **Indications** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| MRI/MRA brain and neck | First-line after negative carotid ultrasound | - No radiation <br/> - High sensitivity for vascular and soft tissue lesions [^11353XiU] | Contraindications (e.g. pacemaker, severe claustrophobia) |
| CTA head and neck | Alternative if MRI/MRA contraindicated or inconclusive [^112SmDfQ] | - Detailed arterial and venous visualization <br/> - Good for bony structures [^115fh5BT] | Radiation exposure <br/> - Contrast allergy |
| CTA brain alone | Not recommended [^11353XiU] | Limited evaluation of extracranial and skull base structures | May miss common causes of pulsatile tinnitus |

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

After a negative carotid ultrasound in a patient with pulsatile tinnitus, the next imaging step is **MRI/MRA of the brain and neck** [^11353XiU]. If MRI/MRA is contraindicated or inconclusive, **CTA of the head and neck** is an appropriate alternative [^115fh5BT]. CTA of the brain alone is not recommended, as it may miss common extracranial and skull base causes of pulsatile tinnitus [^11353XiU].

Regarding diagnostic investigations for tinnitus, and more specifically in the context of diagnostic imaging, ACR 2023 guidelines recommend obtaining a combination of parenchymal and vascular imaging. This can include either head or head and neck CTA, or a combination of head and internal auditory canal MRI, MRA, and/or head MRV. These investigations are advised for patients with unilateral or bilateral pulsatile tinnitus when there is no retrotympanic lesion observed on otoscopy.

Our retrospective study aims to assess the ability of computed tomography arteriography and venography (CT A/V) to detect various findings that suggest a potential cause of pulsatile tinnitus and to examine the association between these findings and the side of pulsatile tinnitus.

A retrospective review of CT arteriography and venography of 32 patients with established pulsatile tinnitus and normal otoscopic examination was performed. The scans were performed using a 64-slice multidetector scanner and were reviewed to look for findings that are known to cause pulsatile tinnitus.

One or more findings that are known to cause pulsatile tinnitus were detected on the symptomatic side in 30 patients; on the asymptomatic side in 3 patients. One patient with bilateral pulsatile tinnitus showed a potential cause of symptoms only on one side, and in one patient, no potential cause could be identified. There is a significant association seen between the side of pulsatile tinnitus and various potential causes of pulsatile tinnitus detected (P < 0.001), between the side of pulsatile tinnitus and various potential venous causes detected (P < 0.001), and between the side of pulsatile tinnitus and the side of the dominant venous system (P = 0.02).

CT arteriography and venography is a useful tool in detecting many described potential causes of pulsatile tinnitus. A significant association is demonstrated between the side of pulsatile tinnitus and the potential causes of pulsatile tinnitus detected by CT arteriography and venography.

### Diagnostic utility of magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography in the radiological evaluation of pulsatile tinnitus [^112Ycsnb]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2013). Low credibility.

Our aim was to assess the diagnostic utility of magnetic resonance imaging with complimentary magnetic resonance angiography (MRI/MRA) in the radiological evaluation of patients with pulsatile tinnitus (PT).

The present study was retrospectively conducted on 27 patients with pulsatile tinnitus. All patients showed normal otoscopic findings and were evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with complimentary magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Additionally, 9 out of 27 patients (33.3%) were investigated using CT, and 12 out of 27 patients (44.4%) were evaluated by angiography. All patients' clinical investigations were reviewed to discard systemic causes of PT.

All hard copies of MRI/MRA studies were evaluated. MRI/MRA detected the underlying etiology of subjective pulsatile tinnitus (PT) in 11 out of 27 patients (40.7%), while 16 out of 27 patients (59.5%) showed normal MRI/MRA examinations. The most common cause was dural arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in 4 out of 27 patients (14.8%). Additionally, high jugular bulbus was found in 2 patients (7.4%), aneurysm of the internal carotid artery in 1 patient (3.7%), aberrant internal carotid artery in 1 patient (3.7%), vertebral artery hypoplasia in 2 patients (7.4%), and glomus tumor in 1 patient (3.7%). The statistical results of the present study demonstrated that MRI/MRA had the following: 80% sensitivity, 88% specificity, 86% accuracy, 85% positive predictive value (PPV), 83% negative predictive value (NPV), and a 15% error percentage for the diagnosis of PT.

In conclusion, MRI/MRA was an effective radiological imaging method in detecting the underlying pathology of pulsatile tinnitus. Magnetic resonance may be considered a first-line diagnostic imaging modality.

### Venous outflow and otosclerosis: An unusual case of pulsatile tinnitus [^117VrNTg]. Ear, nose, & throat journal (2023). Low credibility.

We report the resolution of right-sided pulsatile tinnitus in a 44-year-old male who underwent stapedectomy for fenestral otosclerosis. The initial workup revealed a mixed hearing loss and absent stapedial reflexes consistent with ossicular fixation. CT angiography demonstrated near complete stenosis of the left-sided transverse and sigmoid sinuses and dominant contralateral venous outflow. We hypothesized that the dominant right cerebral venous outflow tract created turbulent flow that was conducted to the cochlea. A successful stapedectomy was performed, and the pulsatile tinnitus resolved. This case report provides evidence that the sound of turbulent blood flow can be conducted through bone, demonstrating an instance where the perception of vascular tinnitus was eliminated with stapedectomy.

Conclusions

PT is common among patients with FMD. These patients have higher rates of neurovascular symptoms and extracranial carotid artery involvement compared with those without PT. Additional studies are required to better understand the mechanisms of PT in FMD and to delineate optimal treatment strategies. These data also support the investigation of the prevalence of FMD among people who present with PT and raise awareness of FMD as a cause of PT among providers who evaluate patients with this symptom.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® tinnitus: 2023 update [^1129JRm4]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for tinnitus, more specifically concerning diagnostic imaging, the ACR 2023 guidelines recommend obtaining a temporal bone CT in patients with unilateral or bilateral pulsatile tinnitus with a suspected retrotympanic lesion on otoscopy. This evaluation is crucial for identifying lesions such as glomus tympanicum, glomus jugulotympanicum, and vascular variants like an aberrant internal carotid artery, dehiscent jugular foramen, and persistent stapedial artery. Consider obtaining dedicated vascular imaging with head and neck CTA and head CTV, as thin-section bony reconstructions from the raw data can reveal the bony details of the temporal bone and characterize most retrotympanic lesions.

### Validity of duplex ultrasound as a diagnostic modality for internal carotid artery disease [^113Dfs6D]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2001). Low credibility.

There is an increasing trend to rely on duplex ultrasound rather than angiography to measure an internal carotid artery stenosis. The aim of this study was to determine the validity of ultrasound assessment of carotid stenosis performed in community-based vascular laboratories. We compared ultrasound with angiography in 225 patients referred to us for carotid intervention.

- **Mild lesions**: diagnosed by ultrasound with a sensitivity of 54%, specificity of 89%, and a positive predictive value of 89% compared with angiography.
- **Severe lesions**: had a sensitivity of 93%, a specificity of 67%, and a positive predictive value of 45%.

Receiver operator characteristic curves demonstrated that the optimal ultrasound cut-off value of 66% stenosis, as a predictor of > 60% stenosis measured angiographically, is associated with a false positive rate of 38% and a false negative rate of 9%. Similarly, if a cut-off of 76% on ultrasound is used to predict > 70% stenosis measured angiographically, it would be associated with a 29% false positive rate and a false negative rate of 11%.

Despite the value of non-invasive testing for carotid disease, duplex ultrasonography performed in non-accredited and some accredited laboratories may produce highly variable results. Using ultrasound as the sole diagnostic test to determine the severity of carotid stenosis may result in a high number of inappropriate operations and a large proportion of patients who may not be offered treatment due to false negative diagnoses.

Traditionally in the domain of the otolaryngologist, pulsatile tinnitus (PT) has become increasingly relevant to neurosurgeons. PT may prove to be a harbinger of life-threatening pathology; however, often, it is a marker of a more benign process. Irrespectively, the neurosurgeon should be familiar with the many potential etiologies of this unique and challenging patient population. In this review, we discuss the myriad causes of PT, categorized by pulse-phase rhythmicity.

### Pulsatile tinnitus as a first symptom of essential thrombocythemia [^116mYCXo]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2010). Low credibility.

Tinnitus is the sensation of sound inside the head and is a common symptom encountered daily by otorhinolaryngologists. Pulsatile tinnitus sufferers hear rhythmical noise at the same rate as a heartbeat and can present a diagnostic challenge. In this report, we present a 32-year-old patient with pulsatile tinnitus that led to the diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia. The symptom of pulsatile tinnitus allowed an early diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia and a more favorable prognosis. The case demonstrates the importance of blood tests for all patients who present with pulsatile tinnitus of unknown origin.

### Dying art of a history and physical: Pulsatile tinnitus [^1166KYbe]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

There is no universally accepted guideline for neuroimaging, especially for headaches. A physician must exercise excellent clinical judgment to reduce the amount of unnecessary neuroimaging. MRIs are notoriously overused; they do not use ionizing radiation, which decreases risks of stochastic effects, have better soft tissue resolution, and the contrast agents have less risk of allergic reactions compared to CTs.

In the case above, the positive finding of pulsatile tinnitus was an indication for the use of MRI/MRA rather than starting with CT angiography. Moreover, the neurovascular surgeon requested an MRI/MRA, so regardless of the findings on CT, the former would be needed. Given the patient's physical exam findings, rather than subjecting the patient to two procedures, we decided to expedite the process by skipping the CT.

It is important to remember that patient disposition ought to be contingent on performing a comprehensive exam. Cultivating a conscientious style of medicine would lead to improved clinical judgment and yield less expenditure and better quality of healthcare overall.

- **Learning points**: A thorough history and physical is a necessity and should not be taken lightly. Imaging modalities are purely adjunctive; they should not dictate treatment until following a thorough history and physical. Decreasing unnecessary imaging will decrease both institutional and patient costs while concurrently increasing the quality of healthcare.

### Vertebro-vertebral fistula presenting as a pulsatile tinnitus [^112v3Ucd]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Tinnitus is the perception of sound in the absence of a corresponding external acoustic stimulus, resulting in an estimated prevalence of 10% to 15% in adults. Tinnitus may be classified as pulsatile (PT) or continuous (non-PT), and may be subjective (heard only by the patient) or objective (also audible to the examiner). PT is usually related to vascular causes and is pulse synchronous, coinciding with the patient's heartbeat. PT is much less common, affecting approximately 4% of patients with tinnitus, but unlike non-PT, it usually has a specific identifiable cause. We present a case of a man without previous otological disease or head trauma, with a left-ear subjective PT. MR angiography detected a left vertebro-vertebral arteriovenous fistula, which was treated by endovascular embolisation with important symptomatic relief.

### Dying art of a history and physical: Pulsatile tinnitus [^116fK8r2]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Our opinion is that it would interest the readership of BMJ Case Reports because it describes an important clinical lesson regarding performing a thorough history and physical before using adjunctive radiographic modalities. Examining the patient is the basis of medicine and should not be forgotten. It is an elementary but significant fact that has long-lasting implications. Our hope is that by urging those in medicine to continue to utilize skills such as auscultation, it will decrease patient costs and improve the quality of healthcare.

### Association of fibromuscular dysplasia and pulsatile tinnitus: A report of the US Registry for Fibromuscular Dysplasia [^111wXfVK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. Data were queried from the US Registry for FMD, the design of which has been previously published. Enrollment in the registry began in January 2009. Each participating center obtained approval from its respective institutional review board, and subjects provided informed consent for enrollment in the US Registry for FMD. Eligibility for enrollment was determined on the basis of identification of the characteristic appearance of FMD from vascular imaging in at least one vascular bed.

Data for baseline demographic characteristics, past medical history, presenting signs/symptoms, physical exam, and vascular bed involvement for patients enrolled in the registry as of December 23, 2020, who were aged ≥ 18 years at the time of enrollment, were included. Statistical analysis was performed using Student t-tests and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests on continuous variables, and χ² and Fisher's exact tests on categorical variables, to evaluate the differences between patients with and without PT. All P values reported were 2-sided, with a significance level of 0.05 throughout.

Statistically significant variables from the univariable analysis were further examined with multivariable logistic regression. Variables included in the final model were those consistently statistically significant (P < 0.05). In addition, because of potential clinical relevance, vertebral artery involvement was kept throughout model selections despite its statistical nonsignificance.

### A compartment-based approach for the imaging evaluation of tinnitus [^112uTyZB]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2010). Low credibility.

Tinnitus affects 10% of the US general population and is a common indication for imaging studies. We describe a sequential compartment-based diagnostic approach, which simplifies the interpretation of imaging studies in patients with tinnitus. The choice of the initial imaging technique depends on the type of tinnitus, associated symptoms, and examination findings. Familiarity with the pathophysiologic mechanisms of tinnitus and the imaging findings is a prerequisite for a tailored diagnostic approach by the radiologist.

### Ct arteriography and venography in pulsatile tinnitus: preliminary results [^1134gHyD]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2006). Low credibility.

Pulsatile tinnitus (PT), a common disorder, can be caused by a variety of otologic and vascular lesions. Various imaging modalities, including CT, MR imaging and angiography, and conventional angiography, have been used in the assessment of PT. Ideally, a single imaging study to evaluate for the largest variety of etiologies would be optimal. In our study, we examine the potential for CT arteriography and venography (CTA/V) in the evaluation of PT.

- **Methods**: Sixteen patients with PT were prospectively evaluated by an otolaryngologist, had a normal otologic examination, and were referred for a CTA/V. All examinations were performed on a 16-section multidetector CT. The carotid bifurcations, internal carotid artery course, transverse and sigmoid sinuses, jugular foramen, internal jugular vein, sella turcica, and temporal bones were evaluated.

- **Results**: Seven of the 16 patients had lesions on CTA/V that could account for their PT. Examples of pathologic conditions in the series included a significantly dominant venous system, a venous diverticulum with stricture, and a transverse sinus stenosis.

- **Conclusions**: Preliminary findings indicate that CTA/V can be a valuable imaging tool in the assessment of PT. With this technique, arterial, venous, middle, and inner ear causes of PT can be excluded.

### ESR essentials: diagnostic strategies in tinnitus-practice recommendations by the European Society of Head and Neck Radiology [^115fh5BT]. European Radiology (2025). High credibility.

Tinnitus is common, with approximately one-quarter of the elderly population experiencing chronic tinnitus. While non-pulsatile tinnitus usually has no structural cause, pulsatile tinnitus is more likely to have an identifiable etiology, and imaging plays a key role in the search for treatable and life-threatening causes. Since the characteristics of the tinnitus guide the diagnostic strategy, a detailed clinical assessment should always be performed before imaging is considered.

In the setting of non-pulsatile tinnitus, imaging with MRI should only be performed if it is unilateral or asymmetric, or when it is associated with focal neurologic abnormalities or asymmetric hearing loss. In contrast, imaging investigation is always required in the presence of pulsatile tinnitus. While there are specific clinical features in which temporal bone CT will be the initial imaging strategy for pulsatile tinnitus (e.g. retrotympanic mass or conductive hearing loss), most patients will require either CT or MRI with arterial and venous imaging. The clinical categorization of pulsatile tinnitus as "arterial" or "venous" may guide the radiological search and help understand the significance of certain imaging findings (e.g. venous variants).

Significant pathology (e.g. dural arteriovenous malformation) must be excluded in the context of objective pulsatile tinnitus and may require additional cross-sectional imaging; conventional angiography is now rarely indicated.

- **Key points**: In patients with unilateral, non-pulsatile tinnitus, MRI should be performed to rule out retrocochlear disease.

### Clinical practice guideline: Tinnitus [^115uyJ27]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for tinnitus, specifically in relation to history and physical examination, the AAO-HNSF 2014 guidelines recommend classifying patients with bothersome tinnitus into two categories: those with symptoms of recent onset (< 6 months) and those with persistent symptoms (≥ 6 months). This classification aids in prioritizing intervention and facilitates discussions about the natural history and follow-up care.

### Duplex ultrasound for diagnosing symptomatic carotid stenosis in the extracranial segments [^1146Vjhu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Carotid artery stenosis is an important cause of stroke and transient ischemic attack. Correctly and rapidly identifying patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis is essential for adequate treatment with early cerebral revascularization. Doubts about the diagnostic value regarding the accuracy of duplex ultrasound (DUS) and the possibility of using DUS as the single diagnostic test before carotid revascularization are still debated.

- **Objectives**: To estimate the accuracy of DUS in individuals with symptomatic carotid stenosis verified by either digital subtraction angiography (DSA), computed tomography angiography (CTA), or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA).

- **Search methods**: We searched CRDTAS, CENTRAL, MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), ISI Web of Science, HTA, DARE, and LILACS up to 15 February 2021. We handsearched the reference lists of all included studies and other relevant publications and contacted experts in the field to identify additional studies or unpublished data.

- **Selection criteria**: We included studies assessing DUS accuracy against an acceptable reference standard (DSA, MRA, or CTA) in symptomatic patients. We considered the classification of carotid stenosis with DUS defined with validated duplex velocity criteria, and the NASCET criteria for carotid stenosis measures on DSA, MRA, and CTA. We excluded studies that included less than 70% of symptomatic patients; the time between the index test and the reference standard was longer than four weeks or not described, or that presented no objective criteria to estimate carotid stenosis.

### Sigmoid sinus diverticulum, dehiscence, and venous sinus stenosis: Potential causes of pulsatile tinnitus in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^111evAVQ]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2017). Low credibility.

Pulsatile tinnitus is experienced by most patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. The pathophysiology remains uncertain; however, transverse sinus stenosis and sigmoid sinus diverticulum/dehiscence have been proposed as potential etiologies. We aimed to determine whether the prevalence of transverse sinus stenosis and sigmoid sinus diverticulum/dehiscence was increased in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and pulsatile tinnitus compared to those without pulsatile tinnitus and a control group.

- **Materials and methods**: CT vascular studies of patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension with pulsatile tinnitus (n = 42), without pulsatile tinnitus (n = 37), and controls (n = 75) were independently reviewed for the presence of severe transverse sinus stenosis and sigmoid sinus diverticulum/dehiscence according to published criteria. The prevalence of transverse sinus stenosis and sigmoid sinus diverticulum/dehiscence in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension with pulsatile tinnitus was compared with that in the non-pulsatile tinnitus idiopathic intracranial hypertension group and the control group. Further comparisons included differing degrees of transverse sinus stenosis (50% and 75%), laterality of transverse sinus stenosis/sigmoid sinus diverticulum/dehiscence, and ipsilateral transverse sinus stenosis combined with sigmoid sinus diverticulum/dehiscence.

- **Results**: Severe bilateral transverse sinus stenoses were more frequent in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension than in controls (P < .001).

### Pathology of the carotid space [^116o2SNj]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

The complex anatomy of the carotid space within a small confined area is unique to the head and neck and allows for a vast array of pathology. This paper reviews the anatomy of the carotid space from the skull base to the thorax, defining its borders at multiple levels, as well as its contents. It also describes the myriad of mass lesions and vascular pathologies that may occur within the carotid space. The discussion includes anatomic considerations in differential diagnoses, imaging features, and lesion characteristics across multiple imaging modalities, including CT, MRI, ultrasound, and conventional angiography. Entities discussed include paragangliomas, nerve sheath tumors, meningioma, fibromuscular dysplasia, carotidynia, thrombus, dissection, pseudoaneurysm, and pathology of the deep cervical chain lymph nodes. Understanding the complex and unique anatomy of the carotid space, as well as the nuances of navigating a broad differential, will empower the reader to make an accurate diagnosis.

### Imaging of pulsatile tinnitus: A review of 74 patients [^112gZAr4]. Clinical Imaging (2007). Low credibility.

Our aim was to assess the effectiveness of imaging modalities in detecting the underlying pathologies in patients with pulsatile tinnitus.

Seventy-four patients with pulsatile tinnitus were radiologically evaluated. All patients, except two, were evaluated on a thin-section bone algorithm computed tomography scan covering the temporal bone and skull base. Fourteen patients underwent these scans with or without contrast-enhanced brain computed tomography; seven patients had magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography; five patients underwent digital subtraction angiography; and twelve patients were evaluated with Doppler ultrasonography.

The underlying pathology of tinnitus was detected in 50 patients (67.6%), while 24 patients showed normal results in radiologic studies. The most common cause was a high jugular bulbus (21%), followed by atherosclerosis, dehiscent jugular bulbus, aneurysm of the internal carotid artery, dural arteriovenous fistula, aberrant internal carotid artery, jugular diverticulum, and glomus tumor.

In conclusion, radiologic imaging methods are effective in detecting the underlying pathology of pulsatile tinnitus.

### Association of fibromuscular dysplasia and pulsatile tinnitus: A report of the US registry for fibromuscular dysplasia [^111u5iXu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

In this analysis of 2,613 patients with fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), we found that 37.2% reported pulsatile tinnitus (PT) as a presenting symptom at FMD diagnosis. There were many clinically relevant differences between patients with and without PT. Patients with PT were more likely to be women. A possible explanation for this finding is the known difference in FMD distribution by sex; women have a higher rate of carotid involvement with FMD. PT was associated with a younger age at the time of FMD diagnosis and several neurovascular symptoms/signs, including cervical bruit. Indeed, patients with PT were more likely to have FMD involving the extracranial carotid but not the vertebral artery. Additionally, a history of headache was more common among patients reporting PT. Importantly, we could not identify differences in headache subtypes, likely due to missing data.

The association between FMD and PT has been previously described. The European/International FMD Registry reported PT as a presenting symptom of FMD in 16.9% of patients. We report a more than two-fold higher rate of PT. This difference likely speaks to the heterogeneity of the FMD population and the differences between the two registries, notably the higher prevalence of cerebrovascular FMD among patients in the US Registry. The study expands upon our understanding of the association between FMD and PT by providing more granular information regarding baseline characteristics, presenting signs/symptoms, and vascular bed involvement. Importantly, it also provides a comparison with patients with FMD who do not have PT.

### Bilateral pulsatile tinnitus caused by bilateral dilated mastoid emissary vein [^1172uczm]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Pulsatile tinnitus is a rhythmic type of tinnitus. Most cases are caused by vascular disorders, presenting as synchronous with the patient's heartbeat. A dilated mastoid emissary vein may cause pulsatile tinnitus. Here, we report the first case of bilateral pulsatile tinnitus caused by dilated bilateral mastoid emissary veins. The patient suffered from bilateral pulsatile tinnitus for two years. His bilateral tinnitus disappeared temporarily when the bilateral mastoid processes were compressed.

Temporal bone computed tomography (CT) showed the bilateral dilated mastoid emissary canals. Cranial magnetic resonance venograms (MRV) showed the bilateral dilated mastoid emissary veins. We explained the risk of surgery to the patient. Since the patient could tolerate his tinnitus and did not have a hemangioma or tumor, he did not choose to undergo surgery.

### Pulsatile tinnitus: A review of the literature and an unusual case of iatrogenic pneumocephalus causing pulsatile tinnitus [^113NHWjT]. Otology & Neurotology (2005). Low credibility.

Pulsatile tinnitus is frequently attributed to identifiable and treatable causes, in contrast to the more common subjective non-pulsatile tinnitus. It usually originates from vascular structures as a result of either increased blood flow or lumen stenosis; atherosclerotic carotid or subclavian artery disease; arterial, venous, or arteriovenous malformations, fistulas, or dissection; and paragangliomas. Other causes have also been reported, with often unclear pathophysiology.

- **Objective**: The aim of this paper is to present a case of pulsatile tinnitus secondary to iatrogenic pneumocephalus and to review the literature on pulsatile tinnitus.

- **Subject**: A 48-year-old white woman had a roaring, very disturbing, pulsatile tinnitus after the removal of a cerebellar lobe meningioma. When the patient experienced the symptom of tinnitus, a pulsatile movement of the tympanic membrane could be clearly seen, and this was synchronous with the patient's heartbeat. Computed tomography revealed an epidural pneumocephalus in the left posterior fossa communicating freely with the air cell system of the left mastoid cavity without any sign of residual tumor. A simple mastoidectomy was performed. The whole air cell system was removed and the mastoid cavity was filled with abdominal fat. After the operation, the pulsatile tinnitus ceased completely and the pneumocephalus disappeared gradually. The patient is free of symptoms 11 months after surgery.

- **Conclusion**: Otologists, neurosurgeons, and skull base surgeons should be aware of this surgical complication and be careful to identify.

### Recent developments in the understanding and management of fibromuscular dysplasia [^112Uvwa1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Patients with carotid and/or vertebral FMD can present with diverse symptoms ranging from headache, neck pain, and pulsatile tinnitus to arterial dissection, transient ischemic attack, or stroke, and less commonly, subarachnoid hemorrhage. A significant number of patients in the US Registry sustained a neurological event: 13.4% of patients experienced a hemispheric transient ischemic attack, 12.1% suffered a cervical artery dissection, and 9.8% had a stroke. The combined frequency of carotid, vertebral, cerebral, and basilar artery aneurysms was approximately 7%; however, the frequency of subarachnoid hemorrhage was very low (1.1%). Pulsatile tinnitus, a pulsatile swooshing noise in the ear, has recently been recognized as a highly prevalent manifestation of this disease, reported as a presenting symptom for 32% of patients in the US Registry. Pulsatile tinnitus is associated with cerebrovascular involvement, cervical artery dissection, and multivessel FMD. For many patients, this is a highly annoying symptom that can impair quality of life and contribute to the morbidity of this disease.

There are no consistent diagnostic physical examination findings in FMD. In some patients, cervical, abdominal, or femoral bruit may be the only sign present. However, the presence of a bruit over the affected artery is not a sensitive indicator of disease. In the US Registry, 30.5% of registrants presented with a cervical bruit, 17.5% with an epigastric bruit, and 6.1% with a flank bruit. The sensitivity of a cervical bruit for the diagnosis of extracranial carotid and/or vertebral FMD was only 45%.

### Dying art of a history and physical: pulsatile tinnitus [^1112D4ci]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Modern medicine often leaves the history and physical examination by the wayside. Physicians instead skip directly to diagnostic modalities like MRI and angiography. In this case report, we discuss a patient who presented with migraine symptoms. Auscultation revealed signs of pulsatile tinnitus. Further imaging concluded that it was secondary to a type I dural arteriovenous fistula. Thanks to a proper and thorough history and physical examination, the patient was streamlined into an accurate and efficient work-up, leading to symptomatic relief and quality of life improvement. Imaging is a powerful adjunctive technique in modern medicine, but physicians must not rely solely on machines to diagnose their patients. If this trend continues, it will have a tremendous negative impact on the cost and caliber of healthcare. Our hope is that this case will spread awareness in the medical community, urging physicians to use the lost art of a history and physical examination.

### Choosing wisely for syncope: low-value carotid ultrasound use [^1154xJdK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Because existing evidence supports the beneficial role of medical and operative stroke risk prevention for those patients with stenosis ≥ 50%, the primary endpoint of this study was any stenosis of ≥ 50% found in either the common carotid or internal carotid artery by ultrasound. Each positive study was classified as "moderate stenosis" if 50% to 69% carotid stenosis was noted, "high-grade stenosis" if ≥ 70% was noted, and "total occlusion" if 100% was noted. Each ultrasound report was also reviewed for evidence of antegrade, retrograde, or abnormal flow in each vertebral artery.

- **Secondary endpoints**: Changes in medical or surgical stroke-risk-reduction therapies were identified by the manual EMR review. Changes in medical stroke-risk-reduction therapy included any modifications of blood pressure management, cholesterol-lowering agents, diabetes pharmacotherapy, smoking cessation, and antiplatelet therapy as a result of ultrasound findings. Surgical stroke-risk-reduction interventions included carotid artery stenting or carotid endarterectomy as a result of ultrasound findings.

For the analysis, we used the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to compare the proportion of patients with these noted risk factors for carotid disease among patients with a positive ultrasound study against those with negative studies. All statistical tests were performed using Stata MP version 13.1 (StataCorp), and a 2-sided P value of 0.05 was used to establish statistical significance. This study received approval from the appropriate institutional review boards prior to any data collection or analysis.

### Aneurysm of a dural sigmoid sinus: A novel vascular cause of pulsatile tinnitus [^114dH4JE]. Annals of Neurology (2000). Low credibility.

We report a newly evidenced cause of venous pulsatile tinnitus — the aneurysm of a dural sigmoid sinus.

### Association of fibromuscular dysplasia and pulsatile tinnitus: A report of the US registry for fibromuscular dysplasia [^111p3Hcg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

The cause of pulsatile tinnitus (PT) in patients with fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) remains unclear. PT can be caused by vascular disorders, including stenosis or tortuosity of the carotid artery, intraluminal webs resulting in turbulent flow, and other vascular abnormalities such as aneurysms, dissections, or arteriovenous fistulas, all potentially present in patients with FMD. Another potential contributor to PT in patients with FMD is the presence of an S‐curve, or extreme arterial tortuosity, of the internal carotid artery, resulting in turbulent blood flow and PT.

A review of 116 patients with FMD found that 32% had an S‐curve present in the internal carotid artery. We are unable to comment on the prevalence of S‐curve presence in this study, as these data are not collected by the US Registry. Notably, carotid involvement in FMD is typically in the mid or distal artery, close to the ear, which may be a contributing factor. From the non‐FMD literature, other factors associated with PT include nonvascular disorders such as intracranial tumors, intracranial hypertension, and sarcoidosis. However, in many cases of PT, there is no clear cause.

In a single‐center review of 84 patients with PT, 68% were found to have an underlying etiology, usually vascular in nature; however, an underlying etiology could not be identified in the remaining 32% of patients. Among patients with PT in this study, 22.9% were found to have a carotid or vertebral dissection, 8.8% had a carotid or vertebral aneurysm, and 37.5% had a cervical bruit, a manifestation of turbulence. Still, approximately one‐third of the patients did not have a clear etiology identified.

### Is there a relationship between subjective pulsatile tinnitus and petrous bone pneumatization [^112SXdtx]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Our objective was to evaluate the relationship between subjective pulsatile tinnitus and petrous bone pneumatization. Twenty-five patients admitted between January 2012 and March 2012 were assessed. The control group data were obtained by assessment of petrous bone images of 25 cases in which paranasal sinus computed tomography (CT) was performed because of chronic sinusitis and no ear pathology was present. Temporal bone CT images of patients with subjective pulsatile tinnitus were compared with those of patients with no ear complaints.

The presence of petrous bone pneumatization was evaluated by CT. Subjective pulsatile tinnitus complaints were present for 32 of 50 ears. Pneumatization was detected in the petrous bone of 22 (68.8%) of 32 ears with subjective pulsatile tinnitus. In the control group, 25 patients (50 ears) with no ear complaints were assessed. Petrous bone pneumatization was detected in 12 (24%) of 50 ears comprising the control group. There was a statistically significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.000 < 0.001). Petrous bone pneumatization might be the cause of the subjective pulsatile tinnitus.

### Duplex ultrasound may lead to misclassification of carotid artery stenosis [^113U2adE]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Carotid duplex ultrasonography (CDUS) is often the first-line imaging modality for the clinical evaluation of carotid disease. Despite improved equipment and the standardization of vascular imaging protocols, CDUS can be technician-dependent and unreliable in calcified blood vessels. The aim of this study was to assess the variability in carotid stenosis severity measured using CDUS compared to reference high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

In this prospective cohort study designed to study long-term brain health outcomes, we enrolled 123 participants with a diagnosis of asymptomatic carotid disease and/or ≥ 2 cardiovascular risk factors, between the ages of 50–85, from vascular and cardiology clinics in Tucson, AZ, for the ongoing Carotids and Minds (CAM) study. Using a specialized radiofrequency coil for carotid imaging, high-resolution time-of-flight (0.63x0.63x1.0 mm^3) and T1-weighted (in-plane resolution = 0.63x0.63mm^2; slice thickness = 2.0 mm) MRIs were acquired to evaluate carotid stenosis severity. A neuroradiologist, vascular surgeon, and MRI specialist utilized cross-sectional measurements of carotid images to adjudicate stenosis percentage based on NASCET criteria. Agreement between percent carotid stenosis categories (< 50%, 50–69%, 70–99%, 100%) derived from MRI and clinical CDUS was assessed using Cohen's Kappa with linear weights (κw). Sensitivity and specificity were calculated to evaluate how well CDUS identifies clinically significant stenosis defined by MRI.

246 carotid arteries were evaluated for percent stenosis using both modalities.

### Association of fibromuscular dysplasia and pulsatile tinnitus: A report of the US registry for fibromuscular dysplasia [^111dogWF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

This study has limitations. We could not offer a comparison with patients with PT who do not have FMD. As this study uses the US Registry for FMD, the data reported are observational and descriptive. Data for the US Registry are obtained via a standardized data collection form to maintain uniformity between Registry sites, and thus open-ended questions are not used. The data collection form does not capture information about the frequency of PT as a self-reported symptom by the patient within the Registry. Unfortunately, information on tortuosity of cerebrovascular arteries, a potential contributor to PT, was not available. Finally, there are limited longitudinal data within the Registry, such as the effect of medical therapy for PT and rates of resolution of PT. Still, this represents the largest data set on FMD and PT.

### An innovative technique for detecting the caudal end of occluded inferior petrosal sinus in cavernous arteriovenous fistula using intravascular ultrasonography–technical note [^113QU9V1]. Neuroradiology (2015). Low credibility.

The patient was a 73-year-old woman who developed pulsatile tinnitus and diplopia three months before admission. Two months later, although the tinnitus had disappeared, she developed a pulsatile headache. Diagnostic angiography revealed bilateral cavernous sinus dural arteriovenous fistula (CS d-AVF), supplied by the dural branches of the bilateral external and internal carotid arteries. Shunt blood flow mainly drained through bilateral superficial middle cerebral veins (SMCVs) in a retrograde pattern. Bilateral inferior petrosal sinuses (IPSs) and superior orbital veins (SOVs) were not able to be visualized angiographically.

Fig. 2 shows diagnostic angiography in case 1. Bilateral (a right, b left) common carotid angiography demonstrates CS d-AVF involving bilateral CSs. Shunt blood flow mainly drains to bilateral SMCVs in a retrograde pattern. Bilateral IPSs are not angiographically visualized.

Transvenous embolization (TVE) through the left IPS was performed under general anesthesia according to the protocol described above. In this case, the tip of the intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) catheter could not pass through the jugular bulb (JB) due to its tortuosity. Almost the entire rostral half of the jugular vein (JV) was investigated with IVUS, and the angiographically invisible IPS was visualized, identifying a low-set caudal end of the IPS. ChromaFlo® imaging could also detect the angiographically undetectable blood flow in the IPS. Under this guidance, we were able to easily navigate the microcatheter to the IPS and finally to the cavernous sinus (CS). Initially, we aimed to occlude the shunt point selectively, but this proved to be difficult. We therefore performed sinus packing, and the shunt was then…

### Pulsatile tinnitus from reversal of flow in an aberrant occipital artery: Resolved after carotid artery stenting [^112rqdwe]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2009). Low credibility.

Carotid artery stent placement, performed for the correction of an asymptomatic severe stenosis, leads to the resolution of persistent and troublesome pulsatile tinnitus. Tinnitus has been reported as a consequence of severe carotid stenoses on previous occasions. This case highlights how an aberrant occipital artery originating above a carotid artery stenosis can result in flow reversal and be a mechanism by which tinnitus may develop.

### The use of contrast enhanced ultrasound in carotid arterial disease [^115MbZEr]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Traditionally, stroke risk stratification has centered on the degree of internal carotid artery stenosis and the presence of focal neurological symptoms. However, the degree of stenosis alone is a relatively poor predictor of future stroke in asymptomatic patients, with the Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial highlighting the need to identify a subgroup of asymptomatics that may benefit from intervention.

Attempting to define this subgroup has inspired imaging research to identify, in vivo, high-risk plaques. In addition to pre-operative risk stratification of carotid stenosis, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) may be employed in monitoring the response to plaque-stabilizing therapies. Unlike most contrast agents used for computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, microbubbles used in CEUS remain within the vascular space and can hence be used to study the vasculature.

In addition to improving carotid structural scans, CEUS has the potential to add extra information on plaque characteristics. Furthermore, by targeting microbubbles to specific ligands expressed on the vascular endothelium, CEUS may have the ability to probe plaque biology. This review describes the carotid ultrasound examination and the need to improve it, the rationale for imaging neovascularization, the use of CEUS to image neovascularization, microbubbles in improving the structural imaging of plaque, potential problems with CEUS, and future directions.

### Spontaneous bilateral dural arteriovenous fistulas with pulsatile tinnitus [^115mVLPs]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Pulsatile tinnitus with normal otoscopic findings often presents a diagnostic challenge to otolaryngologists and can be attributed to serious vascular malformations such as dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs). Spontaneous DAVFs are relatively rare. A 65-year-old woman presented with sudden-onset subjective/objective pulsatile tinnitus on the right side that had persisted for 2 months. Angiography and magnetic resonance angiography revealed DAVF formation. Stereotactic radiosurgery was performed, and total remission of the DAVFs was achieved.

### Toward a diagnostic imaging algorithm for undifferentiated pulsatile tinnitus [^116mmKTr]. Otology & Neurotology (2024). Low credibility.

Decisions around the diagnostic evaluation for pulsatile tinnitus (PT) remain challenging. This study outlines the usage patterns and diagnostic accuracy of imaging modalities, proposing an evidence-based diagnostic approach for undifferentiated PT.

- **Study design**: Retrospective.
- **Setting**: Single otology/neurotology clinic.
- **Subjects**: Patients with PT presenting between 2009 and 2020.
- **Main outcome measures**: Sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic yield, and diagnostic accuracy.

A total of 315 subjects met the inclusion criteria (74% female, mean ± SD age = 52 ± 17 years). Subjects were divided into four cohorts based on exam findings: normal (n = 229), venous cohort (n = 34), arterial cohort (n = 16), and outer/middle ear pathology cohort (n = 40). A nonidiopathic diagnosis for PT was made in 53% of patients. The most common identifiable causes were sigmoid sinus dehiscence (78%) in the venous cohort, carotid stenosis (36%) in the arterial cohort, and glomus tumor (56%) in the outer/middle ear pathology cohort. Diagnostic rates were higher among patients with positive exam findings compared to those with unrevealing exams (p = 0.04). Imaging studies with the highest diagnostic yield were computed tomography (CT) venography (44%), formal angiography (42%), and magnetic resonance venography (40%). Studies with the highest specificity were formal angiography (0.82), CT angiography (0.67), and CT venography (0.67). A diagnostic algorithm is proposed.

Reaching a diagnosis in patients with PT requires a systematic approach.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® tinnitus: 2023 update [^112WNEU5]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Tinnitus is an abnormal perception of sound and has many subtypes. Clinical evaluation, audiometry, and otoscopy should be performed before ordering any imaging, as the choice of imaging will depend on various factors. The type of tinnitus (pulsatile or nonpulsatile) and otoscopy findings of a vascular retrotympanic lesion are key determinants to guide the choice of imaging studies. High-resolution CT temporal bone is an excellent tool to detect glomus tumors, abnormal course of vessels, and some other abnormalities when a vascular retrotympanic lesion is seen on otoscopy. CTA or a combination of MR and MRA/MRV are used to evaluate arterial or venous abnormalities like dural arteriovenous fistula, arteriovenous malformation, carotid stenosis, dural sinus stenosis, and bony abnormalities like sigmoid sinus wall abnormalities in cases of pulsatile tinnitus without a vascular retrotympanic lesion. MR of the brain is excellent in detecting mass lesions such as vestibular schwannomas in cases of unilateral nonpulsatile tinnitus.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging studies based on the best available evidence.

### Carotid endarterectomy relieves pulsatile tinnitus associated with severe ipsilateral carotid stenosis [^116ohFkj]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Pulsatile tinnitus is a rare and often disabling condition, sometimes occurring in patients with severe atherosclerotic carotid stenosis. The effectiveness of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in relieving pulsatile tinnitus in such patients is uncertain.

- **Design, materials and methods**: This is a retrospective study involving 14 patients with pulsatile tinnitus who underwent CEA. Demographic and clinical features, as well as pre-operative duplex results, were recorded, and operative outcomes were assessed.

- **Results**: CEA relieved symptoms of pulsatile tinnitus in 10 out of 14 cases (70%). Among the 10 patients who had lateralisable tinnitus and underwent ipsilateral surgery, 9 (90%) reported symptomatic improvement.

- **Conclusions**: CEA is effective in improving pulsatile tinnitus in patients with unilateral symptoms and severe ipsilateral carotid stenosis.

### Clinical practice guideline: Tinnitus [^114Lur98]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for tinnitus, especially concerning diagnostic imaging, the AAO-HNSF 2014 guidelines recommend not obtaining head or neck imaging specifically for the evaluation of tinnitus unless at least one of the following conditions is present:

- **Tinnitus localizing to one ear**: Evaluation is required if tinnitus can be distinctly localized to one ear.
- **Pulsatile tinnitus**: Imaging is recommended when tinnitus aligns with a rhythmic pulsing sound.
- **Focal neurological abnormalities**: Assessment should be performed if there are specific neurological changes or deficits.
- **Asymmetric hearing loss**: Further imaging is warranted when there is a noticeable difference in hearing between the ears.

### Pulsatile tinnitus: A harbinger of a greater ill [^115G8bM5]. Head & Neck (2009). Low credibility.

Pulsatile tinnitus is an uncommon otologic symptom that may be the presenting complaint of a potentially devastating pathology. Understanding this manifestation as a possible symptom of a significant vascular abnormality is crucial to guide management and treatment.

- **Methods and results**: We describe a 38-year-old woman with sudden-onset right-sided pulsatile tinnitus. A right extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection was diagnosed with MRI/magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and treated with anticoagulation. Follow-up MRI/MRA demonstrated complete resolution. Two months later, left-sided pulsatile tinnitus evolved. An MRI/MRA of the neck demonstrated left-sided extracranial ICA dissection. She was treated in a similar fashion, and a repeat MRI/MRA demonstrated its resolution.

- **Conclusion**: Spontaneous extracranial ICA dissection may present with pulsatile tinnitus as the only symptom in 4% to 50% of patients. Subsequent evolution of a contralateral dissection is even more uncommon. Generally, treatment of this phenomenon is conservative, utilizing anticoagulation or aspirin; however, surgical intervention may be necessary.

### Association of fibromuscular dysplasia and pulsatile tinnitus: A report of the US Registry for Fibromuscular Dysplasia [^112pMX4L]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a noninflammatory, nonatherosclerotic arterial disease that can affect most arteries, resulting in stenoses, aneurysm, dissection, or arterial tortuosity. Clinical manifestations are variable and include several neurologic manifestations. Tinnitus is the conscious perception of auditory sensation in the absence of corresponding external stimuli and has been described in 10% to 15% of the general population. Pulsatile tinnitus (PT) is a swooshing or whooshing sound that is synchronous with the heartbeat.

While PT has been described in patients with FMD, reports have been limited. The aims of this study were to report the frequency of PT in patients enrolled in the US Registry for FMD and to compare differences in characteristics between patients with and without PT within the US Registry.

### Venous causes of pulsatile tinnitus: Clinical presentation, clinical and radiographic evaluation, pathogenesis, and endovascular treatments: A literature review [^112Fup46]. Neurosurgery (2021). Low credibility.

Tinnitus is an abnormal perception of a sound without external stimulation. Venous pulsatile tinnitus (VPT) is a specific form of tinnitus characterized by an objective and often subjective bruit that occurs due to localized venous abnormalities. Clinical evaluation relies on sound quality, duration, and precipitating factors. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and transverse sinus stenosis (TSS) are among the most common causes of VPT. Other causes include sigmoid sinus wall abnormalities (SSWAs), jugular vein anomalies (JVAs), and emissary veins anomalies. These anomalies can be detected using magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance angiography/magnetic resonance venography, and high-resolution temporal bone computed tomography.

The pathogenesis behind the VPT involves turbulent blood flow caused by luminal stenosis or abnormal dilation, amplification of internal sound due to temporal bone defects, and abnormal position of the venous sinus system structures adjacent to the bony structures of the auditory apparatus. Based on these theories, different interventional treatment modalities can be applied to treat the underlying causes. Endovascular treatments have demonstrated high efficacy and safety. Such treatments include stenting of the lateral sinus stenosis in IIH and TSS, coiling of the SSWA and JVA, and embolization of emissary veins anomalies. Further studies are necessary to understand the natural history of these anomalies and the efficacy of treatments for VPT, which — unlike other types of tinnitus — can be cured with proper treatment.

### Pulsatile tinnitus due to stenosis of the marginal sinus: Diagnosis and endovascular treatment [^112nv6qv]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2021). Low credibility.

Venous pulsatile tinnitus is a disabling condition mainly caused by stenosis of the lateral sinus. Here, we aimed to report a novel cause of venous pulsatile tinnitus: stenosis of the marginal sinus.

- **Materials and methods**: We retrospectively analyzed patients with isolated venous pulsatile tinnitus, for which the suspected cause was stenosis of the marginal sinus, treated or not, between January 2017 and December 2020. Patient charts and imaging were systematically reviewed. All patients underwent noncontrast temporal bone CT and MR imaging.

- **Results**: Eight patients (7 women; median age, 36 years) were included. Six patients (75%) were overweight, and 1 patient had idiopathic intracranial hypertension. All patients presented with typical venous pulsatile tinnitus. The stenosis of the marginal sinus was detected using oblique reconstructions on postcontrast 3D MR imaging. There was no other pathological finding except ipsilateral stenosis of the lateral sinus in 3 patients. Four patients underwent endovascular therapy with the placement of a stent in the marginal sinus, leading to complete resolution of the pulsatile tinnitus for all of them. No complication occurred. Notably, the symptoms of intracranial hypertension also regressed after stent placement in that patient.

- **Conclusions**: Marginal sinus stenosis is a novel cause of venous pulsatile tinnitus, which can be easily detected on MR imaging. Marginal sinus stent placement is safe and efficient. We hypothesized that the pathophysiology of marginal sinus stenosis is similar to that of lateral sinus stenosis.

### Negative ultrasound findings in patients with cervical artery dissection. Negative ultrasound in CAD [^116179sh]. Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Cervical artery dissection (CAD) is a common cause of ischemic stroke in the younger age group. Modern imaging techniques can depict the mural hematoma, even in CADs with only subtle vessel alterations. This retrospective study aimed to characterize the angiological features in CAD and determine the frequency of initially normal ultrasonography (US) findings.

- **Methods**: Eighty-six patients aged 44 ± 11 years with CAD of the internal carotid (ICA; n = 55) or the vertebral artery (VA; n = 31) admitted to our hospital within 8 days (mean 1.6 days) of symptom onset were included. CAD was confirmed either by CT-angiography, MRI of the neck, MR-angiography, or digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and was compared with the results of the initial, as well as repeated, US examinations of the arteries supplying the brain.

- **Results**: In seventy-five patients (81.2%), signs of vessel stenosis or occlusion were found. However, eleven patients (12.8%) with CAD of the ICA (n = 9) and the VA (n = 2) had normal US findings. The site of dissection in the US-negative patients was highly variable, without a predilection site. In two of seven patients with repeated US examinations, complete vessel occlusion was found on follow-up, while in five patients, normal results were found again. In four patients, there were changing findings in two alternative confirming imaging methods (MRI/DSA, CT/MRI), and in one patient, conflicting findings were observed (CT/MRI). Brain infarctions occurred in seven of the initially sonographically normal patients, while the other four had suffered from transient ischemic attacks (n = 2) or other complications.

### Dying art of a history and physical: Pulsatile tinnitus [^112Xtja1]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

This case is a prime example of the importance of using physical diagnosis before any adjunctive techniques. The patient had seen several doctors before, and none could reason out her condition. However, after auscultating her right retroaural region, the bruit was extremely distinct and pathognomonic for pulsatile tinnitus, most likely secondary to some sort of anatomical vascular issue. So clear, in fact, that even a medical student could discern something was amiss. This further emphasizes the importance of utilizing basic techniques such as auscultation and palpation. After performing a thorough physical exam, we reasoned that additional techniques such as MRI, MRA, and MRV were necessary to further the diagnosis so the patient could receive the best care possible.

Before the advent of metals and electronics, a physician's diagnosis was based solely on history and what they could feel with their hands. According to Roguin, centuries later, the stethoscope was invented by Laënnec in 1816. Since then, it has become one of the hallmark symbols of medicine. Every physician is taught to use this instrument, and as a result, needs to actually examine the patient themselves. Since then, there has been an explosion of technological development in the field of medicine. All of it is extremely beneficial, but it has driven physicians to rely on what technology perceives rather than their own senses.

For instance, the MRI has rapidly risen to become a staple imaging and diagnostic technique in many fields of medicine.

### Diagnosing pulsatile tinnitus: A review of 251 patients [^116XL5h4]. Otology & Neurotology (2022). Low credibility.

To analyze the underlying etiologies, presenting characteristics, and diagnostic workup of patients with pulsatile tinnitus (PT), a retrospective review was conducted at a tertiary referral center. The study included all patients who received a diagnostic workup for PT between January 1, 2015, and May 31, 2020. The main outcome measure was the diagnostic rate of imaging studies.

Among 251 patients with PT, the most common etiologies were identified as follows: neoplasms (16%), arteriopathies (14%), venopathies (8.5%), middle/inner ear pathology (9.0%), or idiopathic (50%). Patients with identifiable etiologies of PT more often had hypertension, obesity, vision changes, ipsilateral asymmetric hearing loss, or an abnormal otologic examination. Only 18.5% of patients without these characteristics had an identifiable etiology of PT.

The most frequently ordered diagnostic studies were magnetic resonance imaging with contrast (n = 146), MR angiography (MRA) (n = 105), CT angiography (CTA) (n = 84), computed tomography (CT) without contrast (n = 76), and MR venogram (MRV) (n = 62). Both magnetic resonance imaging with contrast and CT without contrast preferentially identified patients with nonvascular etiologies of PT, while MRA and CTA identified patients with vascular etiologies of PT. MRV did not demonstrate a high diagnostic rate for either type of PT. No significant difference in diagnostic rates was found between MR-based and CT-based imaging.

In conclusion, patients who lack a history of hypertension, obesity, vision changes, ipsilateral asymmetric hearing loss, or an abnormal otologic examination are less likely to have an identifiable etiology for PT.

### Imaging of carotid arterial diseases with contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) [^1141DNs4]. European Journal of Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Carotid duplex ultrasound is the standard of care for the initial diagnosis of carotid artery bifurcation diseases. However, in difficult examinations, carotid abnormalities are commonly encountered and may represent a diagnostic challenge in patients with clinical symptoms, as well as in the follow-up after carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) with low mechanical index (low MI) is a promising new method in the diagnosis and follow-up of pathological carotid diseases. Unlike most contrast agents used for magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography, the microbubbles used in CEUS with SonoVue® remain within the vascular space and hence can be used to study vascular disease. In addition to improving carotid structural scans, CEUS has the potential to improve or add extra information on carotid arterial diseases. This review describes the carotid duplex ultrasound examination and compares the pathological findings with CEUS.

### Objectification and differential diagnosis of vascular pulsatile tinnitus by transcanal sound recording and spectrotemporal analysis: A preliminary study [^1177ALky]. Otology & Neurotology (2016). Low credibility.

Although frequently classified as "objective tinnitus", in most cases, vascular pulsatile tinnitus (VPT) is not equivalent to objective tinnitus because it is not easy to objectively document VPT. This study was conducted to develop a novel transcanal sound recording and spectrotemporal analysis method for the objective and differential diagnosis of VPT.

The study was designed as a case series with a control group and was conducted in a tertiary referral center. The subjects included six VPT patients with radiological abnormalities and six normal controls.

The method was tested using recordings obtained from the ipsilateral external auditory canal (EAC) with an insert microphone as the subject's head was positioned in four different ways. The recorded signals were initially analyzed in the time domain, and a short-time Fourier transform was performed to analyze the data in the time-frequency domain.

From the temporal analysis, the ear canal signals recorded from the VPT subjects exhibited large peak amplitudes and periodic structures, whereas the signals from the control subjects showed smaller peak amplitudes and weaker periodicity. From the spectrotemporal analysis represented by two-dimensional spectrograms and three-dimensional waterfall diagrams, all VPT subjects demonstrated pulse-synchronous acoustic characteristics that were representative of their presumptive vascular pathologies, while the control subjects did not exhibit such characteristics.

The present diagnostic approach may provide additional information regarding the origin and nature of VPT.

### Improving diagnostic yield in patients with pulsatile tinnitus: A ten-year analysis [^1165KkKM]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Low credibility.

To determine the yield of a comprehensive diagnostic algorithm for patients with pulsatile tinnitus (PT) and to review the common etiologies and present clinical pearls for their diagnosis, a retrospective chart review of patients with PT from 2013 to 2023 was conducted. Charts were reviewed for demographic data such as age, sex, and BMI; side of PT (or bilateral); specialty clinic of initial evaluation; coexistent symptoms in addition to PT; and final diagnosis (or non-diagnosis). Clinical, audiometric, laboratory, and radiographic data were collected. Putative chart diagnoses were reviewed by the authors and deemed likely or unlikely to be the source of the patient's PT. Those considered "unlikely" were grouped in the "idiopathic" cohort. The diagnostic algorithm is presented in detail.

Two hundred ninety patients were included for analysis. The overall diagnostic yield was 90.7% for all patients and 95.6% for those who completed the recommended workup, a substantial improvement over published rates. Twenty-nine etiologies were identified, with the most common etiology being idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Twenty-one diagnoses comprised no more than 5% of patients. Seventy-three patients (25.2%) had more than one pathology as a potential source for their PT.

PT can present a diagnostic challenge to the clinician. The findings of this study reveal that proper evaluation based on obtaining a thorough history, performing a physical examination, coupled with properly directed imaging studies and blood testing, can accomplish a high diagnostic yield.

### Does the location of a vascular loop in the cerebellopontine angle explain pulsatile and non-pulsatile tinnitus [^116eY9Zc]? European Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to investigate patients with unexplained pulsatile and non-pulsatile tinnitus through MR imaging of the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) and to correlate the clinical subtype of tinnitus with the location of a blood vessel (in the internal auditory canal or at the cisternal part of the VIIIth cranial nerve). The clinical presentation of tinnitus and perceptive hearing loss were correlated. In 47 patients with unexplained tinnitus, an MR examination of the CPA was performed. Virtual endoscopy reconstructions were obtained using a 3D axial thin-section high-resolution heavily T2-weighted gradient echo constructive interference in steady state (CISS) data-set.

High-resolution T2-weighted CISS images showed a significantly higher number of vascular loops in the internal auditory canal in patients with arterial pulsatile tinnitus compared to patients with non-pulsatile tinnitus (P < 0.00001). Virtual endoscopy images were used to investigate vascular contacts at the cisternal part of the VIIIth cranial nerve in patients with low pitch and high pitch non-pulsatile tinnitus. A significantly different distribution of the vascular contacts was found (P = 0.0320). Furthermore, a correlation between the clinical presentation of non-pulsatile tinnitus (high pitch and low pitch) and the perceptive hearing loss was found (P = 0.0235).

High-resolution heavily T2-weighted CISS images and virtual endoscopy of the CPA can be used to evaluate whether a vascular contact is present in the internal auditory canal or at the cisternal part of the VIIIth cranial nerve and whether the location is associated with tinnitus presentation and hearing loss.

### Pulsatile tinnitus and the intrameatal vascular loop: Why do we not hear our carotids [^113KyDXf]. Neurosurgery (2005). Low credibility.

Pulsatile tinnitus is characterized by hearing the heartbeat or respiration in one or both ears. In 15% of patients with pulsatile tinnitus, no cause can be found. Other investigators have suggested that a vascular loop entering the internal auditory meatus can be another cause of arterial, pulse-synchronous tinnitus. If so, we should constantly hear the arterial pulsations of the carotid arteries passing through the petrous bone.

- **Methods**: Using magnetic resonance imaging, 17 patients with unilateral pulsatile tinnitus and 46 with non-pulsatile tinnitus were analyzed for the presence of a vascular loop entering into the internal acoustic meatus. Four temporal bones were sectioned to find structural differences between the internal acoustic meatus and the pericarotid area. Four patients with intrameatal vascular loops and ipsilateral pulsatile tinnitus underwent surgery by Teflon interpositioning between the loop and the cochlea.

- **Results**: In unilateral pulsatile tinnitus, a statistically highly significant amount of intrameatal vascular loops was noted in comparison to non-pulsatile tinnitus. A well-developed pericarotid venous plexus was found histologically. Three of the four patients who underwent surgery were initially tinnitus-free, but pulsations recurred after three months in one patient.

- **Conclusion**: Vascular loops in the internal auditory canal may generate pulsatile tinnitus. It may be treated by placing Teflon between the cochlea and the intrameatal vascular loop. One then does not hear the pulsation of the carotids due to a dampening effect of a pericarotid structure.

### Association of fibromuscular dysplasia and pulsatile tinnitus: A report of the US Registry for Fibromuscular Dysplasia [^112ncebs]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Anatomically, extracranial carotid artery involvement was more common among patients with pulsatile tinnitus (PT) than those without (90.0% versus 78.6%; P = 0.029). Involvement of more than one vascular bed was more frequent in patients with PT (62.7% versus 58.3%; P = 0.029).

- **Arterial bed involvement and vascular manifestations**: Multivariable regression analysis demonstrated findings similar to the univariate analysis. There was an association between PT and fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) involving the extracranial carotid artery (odds ratio [OR], 1.49; P = 0.005) but not the vertebral artery (OR, 0.94; P = 0.56). Patients with PT were more likely to be women (OR, 3.00; P = 0.002), younger at age of diagnosis (OR, 1.12 for each 10-year decrease in age; P = 0.011), have a history of headaches (OR, 1.82; P < 0.001), present with neck pain (OR, 1.64; P < 0.001), dizziness (OR, 2.01; P < 0.001), and have a cervical bruit (OR, 2.73; P < 0.001).
