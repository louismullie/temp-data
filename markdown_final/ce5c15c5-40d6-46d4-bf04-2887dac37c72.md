## Question

What are the indications for each one and which one is more effective (in the cases of free vs total vs reverse)

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about when to use total PSA, free PSA, and reverse PSA (likely meaning percent free PSA), including indications, comparative effectiveness, and practical considerations for decision-making and counseling. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about definitions and the clinical context of PSA-based screening. Then, I should verify the indications and thresholds for total PSA. Next, I will examine when and how to use free PSA and percent free PSA, including cutoffs and performance. After that, I need to check the evidence on comparative effectiveness and how guidelines synthesize this. Finally, I will consider special situations, assay variability, and how to integrate shared decision-making into practice [^1131vA8N] [^116NQTjS].

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't misstate anything. Total PSA refers to the circulating concentration of PSA in serum, free PSA refers to the unbound fraction, and percent free PSA is the ratio of free to total PSA expressed as a percentage; "reverse PSA" in common usage typically denotes percent free PSA rather than a separate analyte, so I will treat it as such here [^115wmWPa].

> I need to ensure the clinical context is clear before discussing indications. PSA-based screening is the usual modality for prostate cancer early detection, but benefits and harms must be balanced, and major guidelines emphasize shared decision-making for men aged about 50–69 years given modest mortality benefits and meaningful risks of overdiagnosis and overtreatment [^1131vA8N] [^116NQTjS] [^111YHZ1h].

> Now, total PSA: indications and thresholds. Total PSA is appropriate for initial screening and for triggering diagnostic evaluation when elevated; historically a threshold around 4.0 ng/mL has been used, but many programs and trials have shifted to lower triggers such as 3.0 ng/mL to improve sensitivity, recognizing the trade-off in specificity and false positives [^114UCgf9] [^111mY6Xq]. Wait, let me verify the screening interval guidance: contemporary recommendations support screening every 2–4 years for ages 50–69 rather than annual testing, aligning with RCT protocols and modeling that retain most of the mortality benefit while reducing harms [^116NQTjS] [^1166SAqe]. I should also confirm that in asymptomatic men with PSA 3–10 ng/mL and a normal DRE, repeating the PSA before proceeding to biopsy is advised to mitigate transient elevations and unnecessary procedures [^115Gjfpu] [^1167Ti8A].

> Next, free PSA and percent free PSA: when to add them. Hold on, I should verify the sweet spot for percent free PSA utility. The clearest role is in men with total PSA in the 4–10 ng/mL "gray zone", where a lower percent free PSA increases the likelihood of cancer and can refine biopsy decisions; commonly used cutoffs range from about 20–25%, with lower values favoring biopsy and higher values favoring observation or deferred biopsy [^114dUSoi]. Let me double-check performance claims: in prospective analyses, adding percent free PSA to total PSA in the 3–10 ng/mL range reduced false positives by roughly 40–42% while maintaining or even modestly improving cancer detection, supporting its adjunctive value in this window [^114dUSoi] [^117NJyXX].

> But wait, what about percent free PSA outside the gray zone? I should confirm that routine percent free PSA is not recommended when total PSA is very low or very high, as it adds little discriminative value and may be misinterpreted; indeed, observational data show substantial proportions of percent free PSA tests are ordered outside evidence-based ranges, which risks inappropriate workups and costs [^114PMcNM]. I need to ensure I note that percent free PSA is less useful for initial detection when total PSA is markedly elevated, where the pretest probability is already high and biopsy is generally indicated regardless of the ratio [^notfound].

> I will now examine comparative effectiveness so I don't overstate any single marker. Total PSA remains the primary screening test with RCT evidence showing a modest reduction in prostate cancer mortality but a clear increase in diagnoses and potential overdiagnosis; the ERSPC meta-analysis suggests about a 21% relative reduction in prostate cancer mortality with screening, translating to roughly 1 fewer prostate cancer death per 1000 men screened over 13 years, alongside approximately 18 additional diagnoses per 1000 screened [^112neE2Y] [^111YHZ1h]. Hold on, I should verify that percent free PSA does not independently demonstrate mortality benefit; it is an adjunct to improve specificity and reduce unnecessary biopsies rather than a standalone screening test with proven mortality impact [^1131vA8N].

> Let me consider how guidelines synthesize this. The USPSTF concludes that evidence is insufficient to recommend one PSA-based screening method over another and insufficient to support routine adjuncts like percent free PSA as a replacement strategy, emphasizing individualized decision-making for men 55–69 years and discouraging routine screening in men ≥ 70 years due to limited benefit and higher harms [^1131vA8N] [^111Dhxgp]. In contrast, the AUA/SUO recommends offering regular PSA screening every 2–4 years for ages 50–69, and supports using percent free PSA as a widely available adjunct to improve risk stratification and reduce unnecessary biopsies, particularly in the gray zone [^116NQTjS] [^117NJyXX]. I should double-check that both positions still require shared decision-making given trade-offs in benefits and harms [^notfound].

> Next, I should review special situations that alter interpretation. In men on 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, total PSA falls by about 50%, so a new baseline PSA should be established after 3–6 months and any confirmed rise from nadir warrants evaluation; importantly, percent free PSA is not affected by these agents and therefore does not require adjustment when used as an adjunct [^115wmWPa] [^116ttR6M] [^116RERvZ]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought percent free PSA might also need doubling, but I should correct that: the free-to-total ratio remains constant under finasteride or dutasteride, so no adjustment is needed for percent free PSA interpretation in this context [^115wmWPa] [^116ttR6M] [^116RERvZ].

> I need to check assay variability because it can change decisions. Different commercial assays for total and free PSA can produce discordant results, particularly for the free fraction, leading to different biopsy recommendations; clinicians should be aware of the specific assay in use and, when possible, use the same platform longitudinally to reduce noise in trend interpretation [^112TdGCW]. Hold on, I should verify that this variability is clinically meaningful; yes, head-to-head comparisons show differences in percent free PSA that alter biopsy yield, underscoring the need for assay awareness and, when results are borderline, repetition or alternative risk tools [^112TdGCW].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach so it's actionable. Start with total PSA in the appropriate screening age range and interval, repeat an abnormal value before biopsy, and consider percent free PSA when total PSA is in the 4–10 ng/mL range to refine risk and reduce unnecessary biopsies; avoid reflex percent free PSA when total PSA is very low or very high, and integrate patient preferences, life expectancy, and prior negative biopsy history into decisions about repeat testing or biopsy [^115Gjfpu] [^114dUSoi] [^116NQTjS]. I should confirm that shared decision-making is emphasized at each step, including discussion of potential benefits, false positives, overdiagnosis, and treatment-related harms, consistent with guideline recommendations and the balance of evidence [^1131vA8N] [^116NQTjS].

> Finally, I should double-check that my bottom line aligns with the evidence. Total PSA remains the cornerstone for screening and diagnostic triage, with percent free PSA serving as a valuable adjunct in the 4–10 ng/mL gray zone to improve specificity and reduce unnecessary biopsies; there is no evidence that percent free PSA alone improves mortality outcomes, so it should not replace total PSA in screening algorithms, and decisions should remain anchored in shared decision-making and guideline-concordant intervals and thresholds [^112neE2Y] [^117NJyXX] [^1131vA8N] [^116NQTjS].

Total PSA is the **primary screening test** for prostate cancer [^1131vA8N], with a commonly used threshold of 4.0 ng/mL [^111mY6Xq]; however, it lacks specificity and can be elevated in benign conditions [^112u5TVs]. Free PSA is used when total PSA is 4–10 ng/mL to **improve specificity** [^114dUSoi] and reduce unnecessary biopsies [^114dUSoi]; a percent free PSA < 10% suggests a high likelihood of cancer, whereas > 25% suggests a low likelihood [^notfound]. Reverse PSA is not a standard clinical test and should not be used for prostate cancer screening or diagnosis. Free PSA is most effective in the 4–10 ng/mL range [^114dUSoi], whereas total PSA remains the **standard initial test** [^1131vA8N].

## Total PSA

### Indications

Total PSA is used for **initial screening** — a routine initial test for prostate cancer screening in men aged 50–69 years [^116NQTjS] — and for **monitoring**, to track disease progression or response to treatment in diagnosed prostate cancer [^114MFpqg].

---

### Effectiveness

- **Sensitivity**: Moderate; can miss some cancers, especially at low levels [^117MnhKD].
- **Specificity**: Limited; elevations occur in benign conditions (e.g. BPH, prostatitis) [^117AGWgn].
- **Clinical utility**: Useful for initial detection and monitoring, but false positives are common [^117MnhKD].

---

## Free PSA

### Indications

Free PSA is used to **refine risk** when total PSA is 4–10 ng/mL (the "gray zone") [^114MFpqg] to differentiate benign from malignant causes and to **reduce unnecessary biopsies** by decreasing false positives and unnecessary procedures [^114dUSoi].

---

### Effectiveness

- **Sensitivity**: Lower than total PSA but improves specificity [^114dUSoi].
- **Specificity**: Higher than total PSA, especially in the 4–10 ng/mL range [^114dUSoi].
- **Clinical utility**: Percent free PSA < 10% suggests high cancer likelihood; > 25% suggests low likelihood [^notfound].

---

## Reverse PSA

Reverse PSA is **not a standard clinical test** and is not used in routine prostate cancer screening or diagnosis; therefore, it has **no established clinical utility** and should not be used for prostate cancer evaluation.

---

## Comparative effectiveness

| **Test** | **Sensitivity** | **Specificity** | **Clinical utility** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Total PSA | Moderate | Low | Initial screening and monitoring |
| Free PSA | Lower | Higher | Refines risk in gray zone |
| Reverse PSA | Not established | Not established | Not recommended |

---

Total PSA is the **standard initial screening test** [^1131vA8N], whereas free PSA improves specificity in the 4–10 ng/mL range [^114dUSoi]. Reverse PSA is not clinically useful and should not be used.

### Comparative effectiveness of alternative prostate-specific antigen – based prostate cancer screening strategies: model estimates of potential benefits and harms [^113iRf9g]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recently concluded that the harms of existing prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening strategies outweigh the benefits.

Objective

To evaluate comparative effectiveness of alternative PSA screening strategies.

Design

Microsimulation model of prostate cancer incidence and mortality quantifying harms and lives saved for alternative PSA screening strategies.

Data Sources

National and trial data on PSA growth, screening and biopsy patterns, incidence, treatment distributions, treatment efficacy, and mortality.

Target Population

A contemporary cohort of U.S. men.

Time Horizon

Lifetime.

Perspective

Societal.

Intervention

35 screening strategies that vary by start and stop ages, screening intervals, and thresholds for biopsy referral.

Outcome Measures

PSA tests, false-positive test results, cancer detected, overdiagnoses, prostate cancer deaths, lives saved, and months of life saved.

Results Of Base-Case Analysis

Without screening, the risk for prostate cancer death is 2.86%. A reference strategy that screens men aged 50 to 74 years annually with a PSA threshold for biopsy referral of 4 µg/L reduces the risk for prostate cancer death to 2.15%, with risk for overdiagnosis of 3.3%. A strategy that uses higher PSA thresholds for biopsy referral in older men achieves a similar risk for prostate cancer death (2.23%) but reduces the risk for overdiagnosis to 2.3%. A strategy that screens biennially with longer screening intervals for men with low PSA levels achieves similar risks for prostate cancer death (2.27%) and overdiagnosis (2.4%), but reduces total tests by 59% and false-positive results by 50%.

Results Of Sensitivity Analysis

Varying incidence inputs or reducing the survival improvement due to screening did not change conclusions.

Limitation

The model is a simplification of the natural history of prostate cancer, and improvement in survival due to screening is uncertain.

Conclusion

Compared with standard screening, PSA screening strategies that use higher thresholds for biopsy referral for older men and that screen men with low PSA levels less frequently can reduce harms while preserving lives.

### Prostate specific antigen best practice statement: 2009 update [^114MFpqg]. The Journal of Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

We provide current information on the use of PSA testing for the evaluation of men at risk for prostate cancer, and the risks and benefits of early detection.

Materials and Methods

The report is a summary of the American Urological Association PSA Best Practice Policy 2009. The summary statement is based on a review of the current professional literature, clinical experience and the expert opinions of a multispecialty panel. It is intended to serve as a resource for physicians, other health care professionals, and patients. It does not establish a fixed set of guidelines, define the legal standard of care or pre-empt physician judgment in individual cases.

Results

There are two notable differences in the current policy. First, the age for obtaining a baseline PSA has been lowered to 40 years. Secondly, the current policy no longer recommends a single, threshold value of PSA, which should prompt prostate biopsy. Rather, the decision to proceed to prostate biopsy should be based primarily on PSA and DRE results, but should take into account multiple factors including free and total PSA, patient age, PSA velocity, PSA density, family history, ethnicity, prior biopsy history and comorbidities.

Conclusions

Although recently published trials show different results regarding the impact of prostate cancer screening on mortality, both suggest that prostate cancer screening leads to overdetection and overtreatment of some patients. Therefore, men should be informed of the risks and benefits of prostate cancer screening before biopsy and the option of active surveillance in lieu of immediate treatment for certain men diagnosed with prostate cancer.

### Screening for prostate cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1131vA8N]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Prostate cancer screening — screening modalities and adjuncts: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening is the usual method, but evidence is insufficient to support one method of PSA-based screening over another, and evidence is also insufficient that a prebiopsy risk calculator (with or without free PSA), genetic tests, or adjunctive imaging meaningfully change benefits and harms; the use of digital rectal examination as a screening modality is not recommended because of lack of evidence and its exclusion from major trials.

### Brief report: free prostate-specific antigen test utilization. consistency with guidelines [^114PMcNM]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The American Cancer Society and American Urologic Association recommend prostate cancer screening for average-risk men between the ages of 50 and 75 years using digital rectal examination and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing. Measuring the percent free PSA may improve test specificity for detecting prostate cancer when the total PSA is between 2.5 and 10 ng/mL.

Objective

To assess whether free PSA testing practices are consistent with published screening guidelines.

Design

Retrospective analysis of free PSA testing performed by a national reference laboratory between October 1, 2003 and September 30, 2004.

Measurements

Free PSA and total PSA results and the age of the patient at testing.

Results

Over 24% of free PSA tests were performed on patients greater than 75 years of age, and 38% were performed on patients with a total PSA either less than 2.5 ng/mL or greater than 10.0 ng/mL.

Conclusions

A substantial proportion of free PSA tests performed in a national reference laboratory appeared to be inconsistent with existing screening guidelines. This raises concern that some of these patients may have received inappropriate diagnostic workup and/or therapy, resulting in excess medical costs and potential harms.

### Comparative effectiveness review: prostate cancer antigen 3 testing for the diagnosis and management of prostate cancer [^113EHQM9]. The Journal of Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

We compared the effectiveness of PCA3 (prostate cancer antigen 3) and select comparators for improving initial or repeat biopsy decision making in men at risk for prostate cancer, or treatment choices in men with prostate cancer.

Materials and Methods

MEDLINE®, EMBASE®, Cochrane Database and gray literature were searched from January 1990 through May 2012. Included studies were matched, and measured PCA3 and comparator(s) within a cohort. No matched analyses were possible. Differences in independent performance estimates between PCA3 and comparators were computed within studies. Studies were assessed for quality using QUADAS (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) and for strength of evidence using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) criteria.

Results

Among 1,556 publications identified, 34 observational studies were analyzed (24 addressed diagnostic accuracy and 13 addressed treatment decisions). Most studies were conducted in opportunistic cohorts of men referred for procedures and were not designed to answer key questions. Two study biases (partial verification and sampling) were addressed by analyses, allowing some conclusions to be drawn. PCA3 was more discriminatory than total prostate specific antigen increases (eg at an observed 50% specificity, summary sensitivities were 77% and 57%, respectively). Analyses indicated that this finding holds for initial and repeat biopsies, and that the markers were independent predictors. For all other biopsy decision making comparisons and associated health outcomes, strength of evidence was insufficient. For treatment decision making, strength of evidence was insufficient for all outcomes and comparators.

Conclusions

PCA3 had a higher diagnostic accuracy than total prostate specific antigen increases, but strength of evidence was low (limited confidence in effect estimates). Strength of evidence was insufficient to conclude that PCA3 testing leads to improved health outcomes. For all other outcomes and comparators, strength of evidence was insufficient.

### Clinical usefulness of assays for complexed prostate-specific antigen [^1175LaeH]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Tests for the tumor marker prostate-specific antigen (PSA) vary widely in specificity and sensitivity. Use of an assay that tests the complexed form of PSA (cPSA) results in improved specificity and sensitivity. By improving specificity, similar results are obtained by cPSA compared with use of the free-to-total PSA ratio but are measured by a single analyte instead of two. Assays for cPSA can serve as a substitute for total PSA in all current applications.

### Prostate cancer screening and the management of clinically localized disease [^117DTK1Z]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Can prostate cancer be prevented?

Epidemiologic evidence indicates that the most effective way to reduce prostate cancer incidence is to decrease PSA testing, raise thresholds used to define an abnormal PSA result (fig 1), and lower the number of tissue core samples obtained in men undergoing a prostate biopsy. In men who receive a PSA test, use of risk calculators that take other clinical parameters (age, prostate volume, free to total PSA ratio) into account or a triage test may help identify men who could avoid a prostate biopsy and detection of clinically insignificant disease, while still detecting potentially lethal disease that requires intervention.

Fig 1 Impact of age on the proportion of men found to have an abnormal serum prostate specific antigen concentration depending on threshold used. The bars represent the 10 year risk of a prostate cancer related death in each age group

The only other strategy shown to reduce prostate cancer incidence involves 5-α reductase inhibitors (5ARI), which are approved for treating symptoms of benign prostate enlargement. Large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and a systematic review have shown that 5ARI reduces prostate cancer incidence but may increase the detection of high risk cancers. These drugs are not approved for prostate cancer prevention. RCTs indicate that antioxidants, particularly vitamin E and selenium, do not reduce prostate cancer incidence and should not be used. Other widely used options including aspirin, statins, low fat or soy based diets, and aerobic or weight based exercise are not clearly effective.

### Finasteride [^115wmWPa]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and the Use of PSA in Prostate Cancer Detection

In clinical studies, finasteride reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50% within six months of treatment. This decrease is predictable over the entire range of PSA values in patients with symptomatic BPH, although it may vary in individuals.

For interpretation of serial PSAs in men taking finasteride, a new PSA baseline should be established at least six months after starting treatment and PSA monitored periodically thereafter. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-­reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance with finasteride therapy may also affect PSA test results. To interpret an isolated PSA value in patients treated with finasteride for six months or more, PSA values should be doubled for comparison with normal ranges in untreated men. These adjustments preserve the utility of PSA to detect prostate cancer in men treated with finasteride.

Finasteride may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer.

The ratio of free to total PSA (percent free PSA) remains constant even under the influence of finasteride. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men undergoing finasteride therapy, no adjustment to its value appears necessary.

5.2 Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer

Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA ≤ 3 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day in the 7-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs. placebo 1.1%). [See Indications and Usage (1.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) .] Similar results were observed in a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART) (1% dutasteride vs. 0.5% placebo). 5α-­reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established.

### Prostate cancer screening: the continuing controversy [^117MnhKD]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men, with a lifetime prevalence of 17 percent. Prostate cancer symptoms generally occur in advanced stages, making early detection desirable. Digital rectal examination and prostate-specific antigen testing are the most commonly used screening tools. The goal of screening is to detect clinically significant prostate cancers at a stage when intervention reduces morbidity and mortality; however, the merits and methods of screening continue to be debated. Prostate-specific antigen levels may be less than 4 ng per mL in 15 to 38 percent of men with cancer, indicating a high false-negative rate. The positive predictive value of the prostate-specific antigen test is approximately 30 percent; therefore, less than one in three men with an abnormal finding will have cancer on biopsy. These limitations of the prostate-specific antigen test have led to variations designed to improve its accuracy (e.g., age- and race-specific cutoffs, free prostate-specific antigen tests); however, none of these modifications have been widely adopted because of unclear benefits. Although treatments have improved in the past two decades, therapy for prostate cancer is not benign and may lead to urinary incontinence, sexual dysfunction, or bowel dysfunction. New evidence affecting screening recommendations continues to accumulate, and two large randomized controlled trials of screening will be completed in the next few years. Current guidelines recommend an individualized, targeted, patient-centered discussion to facilitate a shared decision about screening plans.

### Prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112neE2Y]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Sensitivity analysis based on low risk of bias studies

As planned, we performed an additional analysis using studies that were judged to be at lower risk of bias; this left only the ERSPC study.

Effect of PSA screening on all-cause mortality

Based on the ERSPC trial, PSA screening probably has no effect on all-cause mortality (IRR 1.0 (0.98 to 1.02), moderate quality evidence; table 3). This corresponds to zero fewer deaths of any cause (95% CI 3 fewer to 3 more) per 1000 participants screened. We downgraded the quality of evidence for risk of bias.

Effect of PSA screening on prostate-specific mortality

PSA screening probably has a small effect on prostate cancer-specific mortality (IRR 0.79 (0.69 to 0.91), moderate quality evidence; table 3). This corresponds to one fewer death from prostate cancer (95 CI 1 fewer to 0 fewer) per 1000 participants screened. We downgraded the quality of evidence for risk of bias. When using the ERSPC control event rate at 13 yearsor that of the Göteborg arm of the ERSPC trialat 18 years, this translates to one fewer (95% CI 1 fewer to 2 fewer) or three fewer (95% CI 1 fewer to 4 fewer) deaths from prostate cancer, respectively, per 1000 men screened.

Effect of PSA screening on incidence of prostate cancer

Screening probably increases the detection of prostate cancer of any stage (IRR 1.57 (1.51 to 1.62), moderate quality evidence; table 3). This corresponds to 18 more diagnoses of prostate cancer (95% CI 16 more to 20 more) per 1000 men screened. We downgraded the quality of evidence for risk of bias. Results of this analysis changed little when the Stockholm trial was excluded in a sensitivity analysis. Screening probably also increases the incidence of localised (stage I and II) prostate cancer (RR 1.75 (1.68 to 1.82)), corresponding to 14 more per 1000 (95% CI 13 more to 16 more), and probably decreases the incidence of advanced (stages III and IV) prostate cancer (RR 0.75 (0.69 to 0.82)), corresponding to three fewer per 1000 men screened (95% CI 4 fewer to 2 fewer).

Other outcomes

Since all available data for these outcomes were from the ERSPC trial the results of the sensitivity analysis were the same as that of the main analysis.

### Screening for prostate cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111Dhxgp]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Prostate cancer screening — age-related evidence scope and counseling: The 3 large randomized clinical trials predominantly included men aged 55 to 69 years. There is inadequate evidence on starting screening at a younger age or to obtain a baseline PSA level, and evidence in men 70 years or older does not support routine screening. Although some older men may request screening, men older than 70 years who request screening should be aware of the reduced likelihood of benefit and the increased risk of false-positive test results and complications of diagnosis and treatment.

### Finasteride (Proscar) [^116ttR6M]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and the Use of PSA in Prostate Cancer Detection

In clinical studies, PROSCAR reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50% within six months of treatment. This decrease is predictable over the entire range of PSA values in patients with symptomatic BPH, although it may vary in individuals.

For interpretation of serial PSAs in men taking PROSCAR, a new PSA baseline should be established at least six months after starting treatment and PSA monitored periodically thereafter. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on PROSCAR may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance with PROSCAR therapy may also affect PSA test results. To interpret an isolated PSA value in patients treated with PROSCAR for six months or more, PSA values should be doubled for comparison with normal ranges in untreated men. These adjustments preserve the utility of PSA to detect prostate cancer in men treated with PROSCAR.

PROSCAR may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer.

The ratio of free to total PSA (percent free PSA) remains constant even under the influence of PROSCAR. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men undergoing finasteride therapy, no adjustment to its value appears necessary.

5.2 Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer

Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA ≤ 3.0 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day in the 7-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8–10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs placebo 1.1%). [See Indications and Usage (1.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) .] Similar results were observed in a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART) (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established.

### Screening for prostate cancer [^113LUgXN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Any form of screening aims to reduce disease-specific and overall mortality, and to improve a person's future quality of life. Screening for prostate cancer has generated considerable debate within the medical and broader community, as demonstrated by the varying recommendations made by medical organizations and governed by national policies. To better inform individual patient decision-making and health policy decisions, we need to consider the entire body of data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on prostate cancer screening summarised in a systematic review. In 2006, our Cochrane review identified insufficient evidence to either support or refute the use of routine mass, selective, or opportunistic screening for prostate cancer. An update of the review in 2010 included three additional trials. Meta-analysis of the five studies included in the 2010 review concluded that screening did not significantly reduce prostate cancer-specific mortality. In the past two years, several updates to studies included in the 2010 review have been published thereby providing the rationale for this update of the 2010 systematic review.

Objectives

To determine whether screening for prostate cancer reduces prostate cancer-specific mortality or all-cause mortality and to assess its impact on quality of life and adverse events.

Search Methods

An updated search of electronic databases (PROSTATE register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CANCERLIT, and the NHS EED) was performed, in addition to handsearching of specific journals and bibliographies, in an effort to identify both published and unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

All RCTs of screening versus no screening for prostate cancer were eligible for inclusion in this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

The original search (2006) identified 99 potentially relevant articles that were selected for full-text review. From these citations, two RCTs were identified as meeting the inclusion criteria. The search for the 2010 version of the review identified a further 106 potentially relevant articles, from which three new RCTs were included in the review. A total of 31 articles were retrieved for full-text examination based on the updated search in 2012. Updated data on three studies were included in this review. Data from the trials were independently extracted by two authors.

Main Results

Five RCTs with a total of 341,342 participants were included in this review. All involved prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, with or without digital rectal examination (DRE), though the interval and threshold for further evaluation varied across trials. The age of participants ranged from 45 to 80 years and duration of follow-up from 7 to 20 years. Our meta-analysis of the five included studies indicated no statistically significant difference in prostate cancer-specific mortality between men randomised to the screening and control groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.17). The methodological quality of three of the studies was assessed as posing a high risk of bias. The European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) and the US Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial were assessed as posing a low risk of bias, but provided contradicting results. The ERSPC study reported a significant reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.95), whilst the PLCO study concluded no significant benefit (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.54). The ERSPC was the only study of the five included in this review that reported a significant reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality, in a pre-specified subgroup of men aged 55 to 69 years of age. Sensitivity analysis for overall risk of bias indicated no significant difference in prostate cancer-specific mortality when referring to the meta analysis of only the ERSPC and PLCO trial data (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.30). Subgroup analyses indicated that prostate cancer-specific mortality was not affected by the age at which participants were screened. Meta-analysis of four studies investigating all-cause mortality did not determine any significant differences between men randomised to screening or control (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.03). A diagnosis of prostate cancer was significantly greater in men randomised to screening compared to those randomised to control (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.65). Localised prostate cancer was more commonly diagnosed in men randomised to screening (RR 1.79, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.70), whilst the proportion of men diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer was significantly lower in the screening group compared to the men serving as controls (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.87). Screening resulted in a range of harms that can be considered minor to major in severity and duration. Common minor harms from screening include bleeding, bruising and short-term anxiety. Common major harms include overdiagnosis and overtreatment, including infection, blood loss requiring transfusion, pneumonia, erectile dysfunction, and incontinence. Harms of screening included false-positive results for the PSA test and overdiagnosis (up to 50% in the ERSPC study). Adverse events associated with transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsies included infection, bleeding and pain. No deaths were attributed to any biopsy procedure. None of the studies provided detailed assessment of the effect of screening on quality of life or provided a comprehensive assessment of resource utilization associated with screening (although preliminary analyses were reported).

Authors' Conclusions

Prostate cancer screening did not significantly decrease prostate cancer-specific mortality in a combined meta-analysis of five RCTs. Only one study (ERSPC) reported a 21% significant reduction of prostate cancer-specific mortality in a pre-specified subgroup of men aged 55 to 69 years. Pooled data currently demonstrates no significant reduction in prostate cancer-specific and overall mortality. Harms associated with PSA-based screening and subsequent diagnostic evaluations are frequent, and moderate in severity. Overdiagnosis and overtreatment are common and are associated with treatment-related harms. Men should be informed of this and the demonstrated adverse effects when they are deciding whether or not to undertake screening for prostate cancer. Any reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality may take up to 10 years to accrue; therefore, men who have a life expectancy less than 10 to 15 years should be informed that screening for prostate cancer is unlikely to be beneficial. No studies examined the independent role of screening by DRE.

### Choosing wisely® in preventive medicine: the American College of Preventive Medicine's top 5 list of recommendations [^114zQegb]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening in asymptomatic men — Don't routinely perform PSA-based screening for prostate cancer. American men are estimated to have a 16% lifetime risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer and a 3% risk of dying from prostate cancer, and both the USPSTF and the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care have recommended against routine screening for prostate cancer. There is a slight possible benefit of reducing one death due to prostate cancer by screening 1,000 symptom-free men aged 55 — 69 years for at least 10 years; however, these same 1,000 men would have an estimated 178 men with a false-positive test result, with four experiencing biopsy complications severe enough to require hospitalization. Of the 102 men estimated to be diagnosed with prostate cancer, 33 are estimated to be overdiagnosed, and most of these men would be expected to undergo treatment and experience associated complications, such as urinary incontinence and sexual dysfunction. Black men have much higher incidence and death rates, but the USPSTF stated there is insufficient evidence in this subgroup to make a different recommendation than for the general U.S. population. The article states that men should only consent to being screened for prostate cancer after they clearly understand the associated benefits and risks, and notes that decision aids may be effective ways to engage men in this conversation.

Survival benefit with PSA screening in Europe

From 1994 to 2000, the ERSPC trial randomly assigned 182,160 men aged 50 to 74 years to PSA screening at an average of once every four years or no screening. PSA testing was offered every four years at six out of seven centers and every two years in Sweden. A PSA value ≥ 3.0 ng/mL was an indication for biopsy at most centers. Patients with a history of PCa diagnosis were excluded.

At 11-year follow-up, the incidence of PCa was significantly higher in the screening arm (rate ratio 1.63), and the rate of PCa death was significantly reduced in the screening arm (rate ratio 0.79), with the number needed to screen to prevent one PCa death (NNS) equal to 1,055 men. At 13-year follow-up, PSA screening demonstrated further mortality reduction, with NNS declining to 781 men.

The limitation of the ERSPC is the heterogeneity of data due to multiple centers using different screening intervals and PSA thresholds for biopsy. The greatest benefit to PSA screening was realized in the Swedish arm of ERSPC, the Goteborg trial, where 20,000 men were randomized to invitation to biannual PSA screening versus no invitation. At 14-year follow-up, the screening group had significant reductions in PCa death (rate ratio 0.56, NNS 293). However, other centers showed no significant benefit from PSA screening, including Finland, which had the largest enrollment of the ERSPC sites and very high overall PCa incidence and mortality.

### Strategies combining total and percent free prostate specific antigen for detecting prostate cancer: a prospective evaluation [^114dUSoi]. The Journal of Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

Determining total prostate specific antigen (PSA) in plasma can often identify men who are subsequently diagnosed with prostate cancer. However, excess false-positives create large financial and psychological burdens in prostate cancer screening. The percent free PSA is lower when prostate cancer is present, although to our knowledge no large prospective analyses to date have evaluated whether adding testing for free PSA may decrease false-positives, while maintaining or perhaps improving the detection of potentially curable tumors.

Materials and Methods

We measured total and percent free PSA in banked plasma samples from the Physicians' Health Study in 430 men who were later diagnosed with prostate cancer and 1,642 age matched controls who were not diagnosed with prostate cancer during a 12-year observation period. We calculated the number of cancers detected and the number of false-positives for various strategies of combined free and total PSA levels, and compared them to the use of total PSA alone.

Results

Total PSA with a cutoff of 4 ng./ml. detected 149 cases but also yielded 144 false-positives. A strategy that applied percent free PSA to men with total PSA 4 to 10 ng./ml. detected 133 to 140 cancers and decreased false-positives to 83 of 117 depending on the percent free PSA cutoff used. As the percent free PSA cutoff was lowered from 25% to 20%, additional undetected cancers did not occur until year 9 of followup and the 20% cutoff decreased false-positives and, thus, potential negative biopsies, by 42%. Percent free PSA was superior to total PSA for discriminating cases from controls within the total PSA range of 4 to 10 or 3 to 10 ng./ml. (p < 0.0001). A percent free PSA cutoff of 20% in men with total PSA 3 to 10 ng./ml. detected 10% more cancers with 12.5% fewer false-positives than the conventional strategy of total PSA greater than 4 ng./ml. Cancers missed by combined total and free PSA testing had longer intervals between blood sampling and diagnosis, and a greater likelihood of later diagnosis at an organ confined stage.

Conclusions

These results demonstrate that in a prospective setting with long-term followup free PSA strategies can be identified that decrease unnecessary biopsies, while preserving or even improving cancer detection. Thus, total and free PSA can be combined without the need to weigh subjectively the trade-offs and relative costs of false-negative and false-positive results.

(Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A) Two RCTs, ERSPC and the Goteborg-1 population-based trial, provide evidence that regular prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening every 2 to 4 years in patients aged 50 to 69 years reduces the risk of metastatic prostate cancer and prostate cancer mortality at 16 to 22 years compared to no or opportunistic screening. The number needed to be screened (NNS) and number needed to be diagnosed (NND) to prevent one death from prostate cancer depends on the screening protocol (including screening ages) and follow-up time.

No benefit with PSA screening in the United States

From 1993 to 2001, the PLCO screening trial randomly assigned 76,693 men aged 55 to 74 years to annual PSA screening or usual care. Annual PSA testing was offered for six years, and screening also included digital rectal examination (DRE). Exclusion criteria included history of PCa and more than one PSA test in the three years prior to randomization.

After 13-year follow-up, the incidence of PCa was significantly higher in the screening arm (relative increase of 12%). However, the rate of PCa death was very low in both arms (3.7 versus 3.4 deaths per 10,000 person-years), and the difference was not statistically significant.

Explanations for the lack of mortality reduction seen with PSA screening in the PLCO trial include: 1) contamination of the control group, as 40 to 52% of patients in the usual care arm received PSA screening; 2) elimination of PCa cases prior to randomization, as 44% of patients had undergone one or more PSA tests prior to randomization; 3) no PSA threshold for biopsy (PSA results were reported to primary care physicians and a "community standard" for biopsy was applied at various centers), while the ERSPC authors used PSA cutoffs of 2.5 and 3.0 ng/mL, which was likely more sensitive.

### Dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride (Jalyn) [^113SNo4z]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.3 Effects on Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) and the Use of PSA in Prostate Cancer Detection

Coadministration of dutasteride with tamsulosin resulted in similar changes to serum PSA as with dutasteride monotherapy.

In clinical trials, dutasteride reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50% within 3 to 6 months of treatment. This decrease was predictable over the entire range of PSA values in patients with symptomatic BPH, although it may vary in individuals. Dutasteride-containing treatment, including JALYN, may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. To interpret serial PSAs in men treated with a dutasteride-containing product, including JALYN, a new baseline PSA should be established at least 3 months after starting treatment and PSA monitored periodically thereafter. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on a dutasteride-containing treatment, including JALYN, may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor. Noncompliance with JALYN may also affect PSA test results.

To interpret an isolated PSA value in a man treated with JALYN, for 3 months or more, the PSA value should be doubled for comparison with normal values in untreated men.

The free-to-total PSA ratio (percent free PSA) remains constant, even under the influence of dutasteride. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men receiving JALYN, no adjustment to its value appears necessary.

5.4 Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer

In men aged 50 to 75 years with a prior negative biopsy for prostate cancer and a baseline PSA between 2.5 ng/mL and 10.0 ng/mL taking dutasteride in the 4-year Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) trial, there was an increased incidence of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer compared with men taking placebo (dutasteride 1.0% versus placebo 0.5%) [see Indications and Usage

5.5 Evaluation for Other Urological Diseases

Prior to initiating treatment with JALYN, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In addition, BPH and prostate cancer may coexist.

### Eligibility and outcomes reporting guidelines for clinical trials for patients in the state of a rising prostate-specific antigen: recommendations from the prostate-specific antigen working group [^116ZUFQ3]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To define methodology to show clinical benefit for patients in the state of a rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA).

Hypothesis

A clinical states framework was used to address the hypothesis that definitive phase III trials could not be conducted in this patient population.

Patient Population

The Group focused on men with systemic (nonlocalized) recurrence and a defined risk of developing clinically detectable metastases. Models to define systemic versus local recurrence, and risk of metastatic progression were discussed.

Intervention

Therapies that have shown favorable effects in more advanced clinical states; meaningful biologic surrogates of activity linked with efficacy in other tumor types; and/or effects on a target or pathway known to contribute to prostate cancer progression in this state can be considered for evaluation.

Outcomes

An intervention-specific posttherapy PSA-based outcome definition that would justify further testing should be described at the outset. Reporting: Trial reports should include a table showing the number of patients who achieve a specific PSA-based outcome, the number who remain enrolled onto the trial, and the number who came off study at different time points. The term PSA response should be abandoned.

Trial Design

The phases of drug development for this state are optimizing dose and schedule, demonstration of a treatment effect, and clinical benefit. To move a drug forward should require a high bar that includes no rise in PSA in a defined proportion of patients for a specified period of time at a minimum. Agents that do not produce this effect can only be tested in combination. The preferred end point of clinical benefit is prostate cancer-specific survival; the time to development of metastatic disease is an alternative.

Conclusion

Methodology to show that an intervention alters the natural history of prostate cancer is described. At each stage of development, only agents with sufficient activity should be moved forward.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^112yTHnH]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

Prostate cancer early detection — active surveillance and watchful waiting outcomes are summarized with survival, anxiety, and quality-of-life data. Early reports with follow-up as long as 8 years cite prostate cancer-specific survival rates and metastasis-free survival rates of 99% to 100%, but based on the ERSPC finding that the mortality benefit from screening and treatment started to accrue only at 9 to 10 years after randomization, it is premature to gauge comparative effectiveness. Active surveillance generally is offered to men whose cancers are Gleason grade 6 or less and usually includes regular clinical re-evaluation with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and digital rectal examination (DRE) as well as biopsy every 1 to 4 years; hence, the principal risks relate to those of prostate biopsy. In a cross-sectional comparison, no increased rates of anxiety or depression were observed, although prostate cancer-specific anxiety measures were not included. In Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group Study Number 4, at 5 years there were no differences in depression, anxiety, or worry, but watchful waiting had significantly more obstructive symptoms (44% vs 28%) and less erectile dysfunction (45% vs 80%) and urinary leakage (21% vs 49%); at 6 to 8 years, watchful waiting had significantly decreased health-related quality of life, and those who received androgen-deprivation therapy reported even lower health-related quality of life. Currently, there is no published evidence on the quality-of-life impact for screen-detected cancers, and the principal known harms are repeat biopsy for active surveillance and obstructive symptoms for watchful waiting.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^1166SAqe]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening interval evidence and modeling — Although many U.S. men are tested annually, there is no strong evidence to recommend one interscreening interval over another, and different intervals have not been compared in a randomized controlled trial setting. The ERSPC had a screening interval of 4 years (and a PSA threshold level for biopsy of 3.0 ng/mL) in most centers, and these results provide support for a benefit of screening less frequently than every year. Modeling studies project that screening every 2 years would reduce tests and unnecessary biopsies by 50% while retaining 93% of the years of life saved; another model showed almost 50% fewer tests and unnecessary biopsies and reduced overdiagnosis by 13% while retaining 87% of the years of life saved; a third model retained 95% of the years of life saved. All assumed a PSA cutoff of 4.0 ng/mL with screening starting at 50 years, and one showed similar results starting at 40 years. The average delay in diagnosis when moving from annual screening to every 2 years is estimated as between 5 months and 6 months. In men with very low PSA levels, conversion to a PSA above 4.0 ng/mL within 2 years or even 4 years after the initial test is very unlikely; for example, with an initial PSA < 1.0 ng/mL, only 0.24% had a positive test (PSA > 4 ng/mL) the following year and 0.51% at 2 years, whereas with an initial PSA of 1 ng/mL or 2 ng/mL, only 1.2% were positive at 1 year and 2.6% at 2 years.

### Assay standardization bias: different prostate cancer detection rates and clinical outcomes resulting from different assays for free and total prostate-specific antigen [^112TdGCW]. Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

Numerous commercial assays are available for measuring total and free prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in serum. These assays can be referenced to different laboratory standards, and interassay variability occurs. Patients and physicians might be affected by the variability between PSA assays that results from the use of different PSA standards.

Methods

We prospectively compared the free and total PSA measurements obtained using two commercially available PSA assays in 103 participants from a prostate cancer screening program in Caracas, Venezuela. We recommended biopsy to men with a total PSA level of 3 to 10 ng/mL and a free/total PSA ratio of 20% or less with either assay. We compared the sensitivity, specificity, and concordance index between the two assays to assess the effects of interassay variability on the cancer detection rate and clinical outcomes.

Results

Although the total PSA results were similar between the assays, the free PSA level was significantly greater with one assay. Therefore, the free/total PSA ratio was discordant between the two assays, resulting in different biopsy recommendations and cancer detection rates.

Conclusions

Using a free/total PSA ratio of 20% or less as the threshold for biopsy, the differences in assay sensitivity and specificity for detecting prostate cancer are significant. Commercially available assays for PSA and its derivatives are not necessarily interchangeable, and these differences might lead to different clinical outcomes. When using free and total PSA measurements to make clinical decisions, patients and physicians should be aware of the potential standardization bias and which assay is being used.

AUA/SUO early detection — percent free PSA and multiplex models: Perhaps the most widely available adjunctive test is percent free PSA, and lower percent free PSA is associated with greater likelihood of identifying prostate cancer on biopsy. In the study validating the use of the 4KscoreTM, exclusion of percent free PSA reduced the area under the curve (AUC) from 0.821 (95% CI: 0.790 to 0.852) to 0.699 (95% CI: 0.664 to 0.735). Similarly, percent free PSA improves prediction of GG2+ prostate cancer compared to total PSA (AUC 0.661 versus 0.551) in a study demonstrating the value of prostate health index (PHI)TM.

Decision modeling indicated that screening protocols using lower PSA thresholds (< 4.0 ng/mL) for biopsy and more frequent intervals offered greater potential reductions in prostate cancer mortality but higher rates of overdiagnosis and other harms.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^1144Hhuw]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

Prostate cancer mortality trends and regional screening comparisons — United States, United Kingdom, Connecticut/Seattle, and Tyrol — are summarized as follows: Age-adjusted prostate cancer mortality rates rose at an annual rate of 0.9% from 1975 through 1987 and 3% from 1987–1991, then began to fall in 1991 at about 0.6% per year; from 1994 through 2005 they fell 4.1% per year, dropping below the 1985 (pre-PSA) rate in 1997, and by 2006 had fallen to levels last observed in the 1940s. In Connecticut versus Seattle, initial trends were "not consistent with a screening benefit", despite earlier PSA (prostate-specific antigen) screening in Seattle; mortality rates were "virtually identical in the first few years after the emergence of screening", with later trends showing similar age-adjusted mortality patterns and screening-rate differences that "had converged by 1997", and overall trends "are not inconsistent with a possible beneficial effect of screening". U.S.–U.K. comparisons "have not always reached the same conclusions", with one analysis finding differences "too small to conclude that PSA screening was contributing to a reduction in deaths", while another reported "a striking decline… between 1994 and 2004", yet attribution to screening alone is difficult due to differing screening and treatment patterns. In Tyrol (Austria), an aggressive campaign began in 1993 with free PSA testing without digital rectal examination (DRE) for men ages 40 years to 79 years, and nearly all potentially curable men underwent modified radical prostatectomy.

5.1 Effects on Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) and the Use of PSA in Prostate Cancer Detection

In clinical trials, AVODART reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50% within 3 to 6 months of treatment. This decrease was predictable over the entire range of PSA values in subjects with symptomatic BPH, although it may vary in individuals. AVODART may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. To interpret serial PSAs in men taking AVODART, a new PSA baseline should be established at least 3 months after starting treatment and PSA monitored periodically thereafter. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on AVODART may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor. Noncompliance with AVODART may also affect PSA test results.

To interpret an isolated PSA value in a man treated with AVODART for 3 months or more, the PSA value should be doubled for comparison with normal values in untreated men. The free-to-total PSA ratio (percent free PSA) remains constant, even under the influence of AVODART. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men receiving AVODART, no adjustment to its value appears necessary.

Coadministration of dutasteride and tamsulosin resulted in similar changes to serum PSA as dutasteride monotherapy.

Prostate cancer screening randomized trials (PLCO and ERSPC) — protocol differences and mortality outcomes are contrasted: In the PLCO study, there was no reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening after an average of 7 years with a hazard ratio of 1.13 and a 95% CI of 0.75 to 1.70, whereas the ERSPC reported a hazard ratio of 0.80 and a 95% CI of 0.65 to 0.98, reflecting a 20% reduction in prostate cancer mortality after an average follow-up of 9 years; when adjusting for contamination and nonattendance in the ERSPC, the hazard ratio improved to 0.69 (95% CI, 0.51–0.92), representing a 31% reduction. Both studies began with a PSA threshold of 4.0 ng/mL as the value for biopsy referral and both included digital rectal examination (DRE), but many ERSPC countries lowered the PSA threshold to 3.0 ng/mL and dropped the DRE midstudy. Biopsy adherence also differed, with a biopsy rate that had dropped to 30%; overall, less than half of the men with abnormal screening results underwent a biopsy, in contrast to 85.8% adherence with biopsy recommendations in the ERSPC. Postrandomization consent and treatment setting differences are noted, and these factors may explain why a significant reduction in prostate cancer mortality was noted in the ERSPC but not in the PLCO study.

Prostate-specific antigen screening in high-risk populations — Test positivity generally increases with advancing age; in men younger than age 50 years, test positivity, based on a 4-ng/mL PSA cutoff, ranges between 2% and 3% and increases up to as high as 28% among men ages 70 years and older, while the prostate cancer detection rate and positive predictive value (PPV) are lower among men younger than age 50 years (1%-2%, and 6%-38%, respectively) compared with older men (13% and 39%-58%, respectively), and specificity decreases with increasing age (from 97% to 98% in younger adults compared with 80% in older adults); in African American men ages 70 to 79 years, based on a 4-ng/mL PSA cutoff, test positivity reportedly may be as high as 54% with a prostate cancer detection rate of 25% and a PPV of 59%.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^114a5coV]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

American Cancer Society guideline — shared decision-making for prostate cancer screening emphasizes involving men in whether to initiate and continue testing and states that men must have a basic understanding of the potential benefits of early detection, the strengths and limitations of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, and the risks of finding and treating screen-detected cancer. Health care providers can and should play a critical role, and we encourage providers and patients to use prostate cancer screening decision aids; for men who are unable to decide, the screening decision can be left to the discretion of the health care provider, who should factor into the decision his or her knowledge of the patient's general health preferences and values. In view of the delay between diagnosis through screening and the expected mortality benefit, we continue to recommend that men whose life expectancy is less than 10 years not pursue prostate cancer early detection, noting that the likelihood of benefit in these men is sufficiently low to be outweighed by the risk of harms from treatment in the near term.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^114UCgf9]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

PLCO and ERSPC trial designs and screening triggers indicate that the PLCO study enrolled 76,693 men ages 55 years to 74 years who were screened annually with a serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test and a digital rectal examination (DRE), whereas the ERSPC enrolled a total of 162,243 men ages 55 years to 69 years; these men generally were screened every 4 years mostly with PSA only. In the PLCO study, prostate biopsy was recommended for men whose PSA exceeded 4 ng/mL or whose DRE revealed a suspicious nodule, whereas in the ERSPC a PSA of 3 ng/mL generally was used without DRE to trigger a biopsy.

Informed and shared decision making — when the evidence is not clear that the benefits of screening outweigh the risks, an individual's values and preferences must be factored into the screening decision; given the uncertain balance between benefits and risks, it is vital to involve men in the decision whether to screen, and for informed decision making to occur, the individual should understand the basic aspects of prostate cancer and the role of screening, understand the uncertainties, risks, and potential benefits associated with testing and the option not to be tested, consider his preferences and values about screening, choose a level of participation in the decision with which he is comfortable, and make (or defer) a decision based on his values and preferences.

### Summary of the standards, options and recommendations for the management of patients with nonmetastatic prostate cancer (2001) [^113bhrWy]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

Further prostate biopsies after initial negative biopsy (Figure 2)

When curative treatment is not planned, an additional work-up is not indicated (standard). When curative treatment is planned there are two possible options: (1) no further biopsy; (2) wait for 3 months and then re-evaluate with serum PSA determination and ultrasound-guided biopsy. Depending on the degree of suspicion, the additional work-up for re-evaluation can include: PSA velocity and the percentage of free PSA; a further series of biopsies including the transition zone (the number of biopsies can be increased by including laterally directed biopsies in the peripheral zone) or a transurethral resection (option). If the test result is suspicious (PSA concentration, digital rectal examination), a second series of biopsies is recommended (recommendation).

Management of patients following a diagnosis of stage T1a or T1b cancer (Figure 3)

Figure 3
Management of patients with stage T1a and T1b tumours.

There are two therapeutic options possible for patients with a life expectancy of more than 10 years: primary curative treatment or evaluation of the remaining prostate to confirm the presence of residual tumour. The remaining prostate should be biopsied if the postoperative digital rectal examination is abnormal, and/or the 3-month postoperative PSA concentration is higher than 4 μ g l −1 or has been reduced by less than 50%. If the results of the biopsies of the remaining prostate are negative, clinical surveillance and determination of serum PSA concentrations should be performed every 6 months (option). If the biopsies of the remaining prostate are positive, curative treatment should be undertaken. Curative treatment is not recommended for patients with a life expectancy of less than 10 years (recommendation, expert agreement).

### Serial percent free prostate specific antigen in combination with prostate specific antigen for population based early detection of prostate cancer [^1154vqi5]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

We characterized the diagnostic properties of serial percent free prostate specific antigen in relation to prostate specific antigen in a multiethnic, multiracial cohort of healthy men.

Materials and Methods

A total of 6,982 percent free prostate specific antigen and prostate specific antigen measurements were obtained from participants in a greater than 12-year Texas screening study comprising 1,625 men who never underwent biopsy, 497 who underwent 1 or more biopsies negative for prostate cancer and 61 diagnosed with prostate cancer. We evaluated the ROC AUC of percent free prostate specific antigen and the proportion of patients with fluctuating values across multiple visits determined according to 2 thresholds (less than 15% vs 25%). The proportion of cancer cases in which percent free prostate specific antigen indicated a positive test before prostate specific antigen greater than 4 ng/ml did and the number of negative biopsies that would have been spared by negative percent free prostate specific antigen test results were calculated.

Results

Percent free prostate specific antigen fluctuated around its threshold of less than 25% (less than 15%) in 38.3% (78.1%), 42.2% (20.9%), and 11.4% (25.7%) of patients never biopsied, and with negative and positive biopsies, respectively. At the same thresholds, percent free prostate specific antigen tested positive earlier than prostate specific antigen in 71.4% and 34.2% of cancer cases, respectively. Among men with multiple negative biopsies and PSA greater than 4 ng/ml, percent free PSA would have tested negative in 31.6% and 65.8%, respectively.

Conclusions

Percent free prostate specific antigen should accompany prostate specific antigen testing to potentially spare unnecessary biopsies or detect cancer earlier. When near the threshold, both tests should be repeated due to commonly observed fluctuation.

AUA/SUO prostate cancer screening — AUA nomenclature describes Conditional Recommendation and defines Clinical Principle and Expert Opinion. For Conditional Recommendation (Net benefit or harm comparable to other options), one description states "Benefits = Risks/Burdens" and that the "Best action depends on individual patient circumstances" with "Future Research is unlikely to change confidence"; another states "Best action appears to depend on individual patient circumstances" and that "Better evidence could change confidence"; and a third states "Balance between Benefits & Risks/Burdens unclear", "Net benefit (or net harm) comparable to other options", "Alternative strategies may be equally reasonable", and "Better evidence likely to change confidence". The guideline also defines Clinical Principle as "a statement about a component of clinical care that is widely agreed upon by urologists or other clinicians for which there may or may not be evidence in the medical literature" and Expert Opinion as "a statement, achieved by consensus of the Panel, that is based on members' clinical training, experience, knowledge, and judgment for which there may or may not be evidence in the medical literature".

### Specificity of serum prostate-specific antigen determination in the Finnish prostate cancer screening trial [^114ZPDaf]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

An invitation letter was sent to the men of the screening arm with an information leaflet describing the trial, appended with a brief questionnaire about urological symptoms, family history of prostate cancer, previous PSA tests and an informed consent form to be signed by the subject. This approach is called randomisation before consent or Zelen-type randomisation.

After an informed consent, a blood sample was drawn at the local cancer society clinics in Helsinki and Tampere. Serum PSA concentrations were analysed at the Central Laboratory of Helsinki University Hospital by Hybritech Tandem-E for determination of total PSA and Wallac AutoDelfia for free PSA.

Men with serum PSA⩾4 ng mL −1 were referred to the local hospital for diagnostic examinations, including three examinations for all men: digital rectal examination (DRE), transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and prostate biopsy (compliance with biopsy 95%). Men with serum PSA concentration 3.0–3.9 ng mL −1 were referred for supplementary test: DRE during the first 3 years and the proportion of free PSA (F/T-PSA) since 1999 with a cutoff point of 0.16. Those with a positive ancillary test were also referred to diagnostic work-up. Diagnosis of prostate cancer was based on histological confirmation. The biopsy protocol consisted initially of sextant biopsies, but the number of cores was increased to 10–12 in 2002. A re-biopsy was carried out if either the PSA was above 10 ng mL −1 or the initial histopathologic diagnosis was prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, atypical small acinar proliferation or unconfirmed suspicion for carcinoma. Information on screen-detected cases was obtained from the trial database and interval cancers were identified from the population-based, nationwide Finnish Cancer Registry.

Specificity was defined as the proportion of the disease-free men correctly classified as negative by the test (PSA < 4.0 mg mL −1, or PSA 3.0–3.9 ng mL −1 with a positive ancillary test), among men classified as disease-free during the screening episode (including both SN men and those who were screen positive but had a negative biopsy). Confidence interval (CI) for specificity was calculated based on standard error for a proportion, s.e. (p) = √(pq/n).

The study protocol was approved by the ethical committees in each participating hospital. Permission to use the data of the cancer registry was obtained from the Research and Development Center for Welfare and Health (STAKES).

### Recent changes in prostate cancer screening practices and epidemiology [^111ifKWa]. The Journal of Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Prostate specific antigen based screening for prostate cancer has had a significant impact on the epidemiology of the disease. Its use has been associated with a significant decrease in prostate cancer mortality but has also resulted in the over diagnosis and overtreatment of indolent prostate cancer, exposing many men to the harms of treatment without benefit. The USPSTF (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force) in 2008 issued a recommendation against screening men older than 75 years, and in 2012 against routine screening for all men, indicating that in its interpretation the harms of screening outweigh the benefits. We review changes in the use of prostate specific antigen testing, performance of prostate biopsy, incidence of prostate cancer and stage of disease at presentation since 2012.

Materials and Methods

An English language literature search was performed for terms that included "prostate specific antigen", "screening" and "United States Preventive Services Task Force" in various combinations. A total of 26 original studies had been published on the effects of the USPSTF recommendations on prostate specific antigen based screening or prostate cancer incidence in the United States as of December 1, 2016.

Results

Review of the literature from 2012 through the end of 2016 indicates that there has been a decrease in prostate specific antigen testing and prostate biopsy. As a result, there has been a decline in the incidence of localized prostate cancer, including low, intermediate and high risk disease. The data regarding stage at presentation have yet to mature but there are some early signs of a shift toward higher burden of disease at presentation.

Conclusions

These findings raise concern about a reversal of the observed improvement in prostate cancer specific mortality during preceding decades. Alternative screening strategies would 1) incorporate patient preferences by allowing shared decision-making, 2) preserve the survival benefits associated with screening, 3) improve the specificity of screening to reduce unnecessary biopsies and detection of low risk disease, and 4) promote the use of active surveillance for low risk cancers if they are detected.

### The prostate health index selectively identifies clinically significant prostate cancer [^115tytib]. The Journal of Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

The Prostate Health Index (phi) is a new test combining total, free and [-2]proPSA into a single score. It was recently approved by the FDA and is now commercially available in the U.S. Europe and Australia. We investigate whether phi improves specificity for detecting clinically significant prostate cancer and can help reduce prostate cancer over diagnosis.

Materials and Methods

From a multicenter prospective trial we identified 658 men age 50 years or older with prostate specific antigen 4 to 10 ng/ml and normal digital rectal examination who underwent prostate biopsy. In this population we compared the performance of prostate specific antigen, % free prostate specific antigen, [-2]proPSA and phi to predict biopsy results and, specifically, the presence of clinically significant prostate cancer using multiple criteria.

Results

The Prostate Health Index was significantly higher in men with Gleason 7 or greater and "Epstein significant" cancer. On receiver operating characteristic analysis phi had the highest AUC for overall prostate cancer (AUCs phi 0.708, percent free prostate specific antigen 0.648, [-2]proPSA 0.550 and prostate specific antigen 0.516), Gleason 7 or greater (AUCs phi 0.707, percent free prostate specific antigen 0.661, [-2]proPSA 0.558, prostate specific antigen 0.551) and significant prostate cancer (AUCs phi 0.698, percent free prostate specific antigen 0.654, [-2]proPSA 0.550, prostate specific antigen 0.549). At the 90% sensitivity cut point for phi (a score less than 28.6) 30.1% of patients could have been spared an unnecessary biopsy for benign disease or insignificant prostate cancer compared to 21.7% using percent free prostate specific antigen.

Conclusions

The new phi test outperforms its individual components of total, free and [-2]proPSA for the identification of clinically significant prostate cancer. Phi may be useful as part of a multivariable approach to reduce prostate biopsies and over diagnosis.

### False-positive screening results in the Finnish prostate cancer screening trial [^114i15T7]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

In our study, a PSA threshold of 4.0 ng mL −1 was used. In addition, during 1996–1998, men with a suspicious DRE finding and in 1999–2007 men with PSA 3.0–3.9 and free/total PSA ratio ≤ 16% were referred. The PSA threshold was chosen in 1996 when the study began. A study from the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial reported that 24.7% of men in the placebo group with PSA 2.1–4.0 had PC when biopsied at the end of the study, although 50% of these men were older than 71 years and all the cancers were stage T1. In another study with younger subjects (50–65 years), 11.3% (13 of 115) of men with PSA level 1.1–3.99 and F/T PSA ⩾20% had cancer in biopsy. In our study with men aged 55–71 years, the proportion of PC from those biopsied varied from 26.6 to 32.9%. If the PSA threshold had been lower, for example, 2.1–3.9 ng mL −1, the proportion of PC in the biopsied men would probably be smaller, that is, the downside of the expected improvement in sensitivity would be a decreased specificity.

A screen-detected cancer was defined as a PC detected within 1 year from the PSA test in a man with a screen-positive result. On this basis, we defined an FP as a screen-positive result with no PC diagnosis within 1 year from the PSA test (excluding men without biopsy). Prostate-specific antigen predicts the development of PC by several years and there is no clear time as for the optimal definition of an FP result, but the proportion of de novo cases relative to those present at the screen can be anticipated to increase with time since the PSA test. If we had extended our 1-year limit to, for example, 3 years, the number of FP results would have decreased by 86 (6.5%), 88 (5.9%) and 47 (4.7%) men in the first, second and third rounds, respectively. These men were diagnosed with an interval cancer within 1–3 years from the PSA test. As the proportion of these men out of all FP men was relatively small (4.7–6.5%), using another definition would not be likely to materially affect our results.

### Specificity of serum prostate-specific antigen determination in the Finnish prostate cancer screening trial [^113Xsznt]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Specificity constitutes a component of validity for a screening test. The number of false-positive (FP) results has been regarded as one of major shortcomings in prostate cancer screening. We estimated the specificity of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) determination in prostate cancer screening using data from a randomised, controlled screening trial conducted in Finland with 32 000 men in the screening arm. We calculated the specificity as the proportion of men with negative findings (screen negatives, SN) relative to those with negative and FP results (SN/(SN+FP)). A SN finding was defined as either PSA ≤ 4 ng mL −1 or PSA 3.0–3.9 ng mL −1 combined with a negative ancillary test (digital rectal examination, DRE or free/total, F/T PSA ratio). False positives were those with positive screening test followed by a negative diagnostic examination. Of the 30 194 eligible men, 20 794 (69%) attended the first screening round and 1968 (9.5%) had a screen-positive finding. A total of 508 prostate cancers were detected at screening (2.4%). Hence, the number of SN findings was 18 825 and the number of FP results 1358. Specificity was estimated as 0.933 (18 825 out of 20 183) with 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.929–0.936. Specificity decreased with age. Digital rectal examination as ancillary examination had similar or higher specificity than F/T PSA. In the second screening round, specificity was slightly lower (0.912, 95% CI 0.908–0.916). The specificity of PSA screening in the Finnish screening trial is acceptable. Further improvement in specificity could, however, improve acceptability of screening and decrease screening costs.

### The effects of the blood-based S2, 3PSA% test on prostate cancer screening: a novel approach to reduce the need for MRI and unnecessary biopsies [^112qctwc]. The Prostate (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in men worldwide. Prostate‐specific antigen (PSA) is widely used as a biomarker for prostate cancer (PCa). PSA‐based screening has been shown to reduce PCa‐related mortality. However, the clinical utility of PSA test is limited by its low cancer specificity, which can result in unnecessary biopsies, overdiagnosis, and overtreatment. To address these limitations, risk stratification tools such as the Prostate Imaging‐Reporting and Data System (PI‐RADS) and novel biomarkers, including the prostate health index (phi), have been developed to better assess PCa risk before biopsy. We recently identified a novel biomarker, S2,3PSA%, which improves the specificity of prostate cancer detection by distinguishing cancer‐type PSA from non‐cancer PSA based on aberrantly glycosylated free‐PSA. In the PSA range of 4–10 ng/mL, the diagnostic performance of S2,3PSA% (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.727) was superior to that of total PSA (AUC: 0.517) and the free‐to‐total PSA ratio (AUC: 0.679). Based on these findings, the S2,3PSA% test was approved on February 1, 2024, and is now covered by insurance as a secondary screening tool for prostate cancer following initial PSA test. Our preliminary analysis suggests that the performance of S2,3PSA% is comparable to conventional methods, excluding phi and MRI‐based PI‐RADS scores. However, the effectiveness of S2,3PSA% in the context of PSA‐based prostate cancer screening has not yet been fully investigated.

Therefore, we conducted this study to evaluate the impact of S2,3PSA% test on the need for unnecessary MRI examinations and prostate biopsies.

### The detection and potential economic value of complexed prostate specific antigen as a first line test [^117ST2rq]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Prostate cancer detection is subject to a number of variables that can lead to unnecessary biopsies and associated costs. Measuring cPSA has been proposed as an alternative to tPSA for the early detection of prostate cancer.

Materials and Methods

Between November 1998 and April 2000, 1,362 men underwent transrectal ultrasound guided biopsies at 7 institutions. Of 1,243 evaluable men 467 with tPSA between 2.5 and 6.0 ng/ml, and normal digital rectal examination were analyzed. Statistical analysis used to compare cancer detection rates between PSA assays was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test. A separate group of 2,807 men who participated in a free cancer detection program was used to determine the current tPSA distribution and assess the economic impact of cPSA.

Results

Cancer was detected in 31.5% of the men (147 of 467) with tPSA between 2.5 and 6.0 ng/ml. Using a 2.2 ng/ml cPSA cutoff point detected 93.9% of cancers and would have avoided 20.3% of unnecessary biopsies in men with tPSA between 2.5 and 4.0 ng/ml. A 2.2 ng/ml cPSA cutoff point achieved an 11.9% overall decrease in the number of unnecessary biopsies in the tPSA range of 2.5 to 6.0 ng/ml with accompanying 98% sensitivity. The decrease in unnecessary biopsies is potentially associated with substantial health care cost savings.

Conclusions

In the clinically relevant sensitivity ranges a 2.2 ng/ml cPSA cutoff point decreases the number of unnecessary biopsies and maintains higher specificity than a tPSA threshold of 2.5 ng/ml, illustrating the potential value of cPSA as a first line diagnostic test.

### Specificity of serum prostate-specific antigen determination in the Finnish prostate cancer screening trial [^112u5TVs]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

The validity of a screening test is the capability to discriminate between those with and without disease, and can be measured by sensitivity and specificity. Ideally, a screening test should be able to classify correctly both subjects with and without the target disorder. In practice, the distributions of test values between these two populations always overlap. Sensitivity indicates the capacity to find persons with disease, whereas specificity is the ability to identify those free of the target disorder. Sensitivity and specificity are characteristics of the test that are independent of the occurrence of the disease in the target population, but may depend on disease characteristics. Specificity is inversely proportional to the frequency of FP tests in those free of disease. In the context of cancer screening, optimal specificity depends on how many negative (unnecessary) biopsies one is willing to accept in order to detect one case of cancer. Specificity of a screening test is an indicator of the adverse effects of screening, including the cost and inconvenience owing to the diagnostic examination. Specificity is a characteristic of the test and an indicator of test performance used in evaluation of screening methods, but not directly applicable in decision making at the individual level.

Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers among men in the industrial countries. Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was identified in the 1970s and later shown to be a marker of prostate cancer. It has been adopted for case finding among asymptomatic men, which has substantially increased the detection and incidence of prostate cancer. Opportunistic screening with PSA is widespread, but the evidence for its effectiveness in terms of mortality reduction is still lacking. One of the problems with PSA screening is the large proportion of FP results, as PSA is an organ-specific, but not disease-specific marker. The main cause of elevated serum PSA concentration is benign prostatic hyperplasia. A positive screening test in the absence of disease leads to unnecessary biopsies and constitutes an adverse effect of screening, which adds costs, increases overdiagnosis and overtreatment and can affect acceptability of screening, that is, reduce participation at subsequent screening rounds. This is especially important in population screening, where the proportion of those with disease is low.

The aim of the study was to estimate the specificity of the PSA test in the Finnish prostate cancer screening trial.

### Specificity of serum prostate-specific antigen determination in the Finnish prostate cancer screening trial [^113K5t7C]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Specificity was only slightly lower in the second screening round compared with the first. This was due to participants being older at the second round. The main factor is probably the strong increase in prevalence of benign prostatic hyperplasia with age. Introduction of a new biopsy regimen with increased number of cores may have also decreased the number of apparent FP screening findings (if a larger proportion of true-positive findings were detected). In both rounds, the specificity was higher in the young age groups. This finding indicates that specificity is likely to decrease at subsequent screening rounds, as age at screening increases.

Digital rectal examination as an ancillary test among men with intermediate PSA levels was associated with a lower rate of FP findings than F/T PSA and hence, slightly higher specificity. The yield was also lower than with free PSA (2.1% vs 5.2% of men with PSA 3.0–3.9 ng mL −1). This is consistent with the findings from a Dutch screening trial, where the specificity of DRE was 91%. However, the costs for a DRE are substantially higher than determination of F/T PSA in our trial, where a blood sample is drawn initially and can be used for determination of both total and free PSA, whereas DRE requires a separate visit for an urologist.

### Testosterone [^114rebwu]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Testosterone gel, 1.62% was evaluated in a two-phase, 364-day, controlled clinical study. The first phase was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled period of 182 days, in which 234 hypogonadal men were treated with testosterone gel, 1.62% and 40 received placebo. Patients could continue in an open-label, non-comparative, maintenance period for an additional 182 days [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

The most common adverse reaction reported in the double-blind period was increased prostate specific antigen (PSA) reported in 26 testosterone gel, 1.62%-treated patients (11.1%). In 17 patients, increased PSA was considered an adverse event by meeting one of the two pre-specified criteria for abnormal PSA values, defined as (1) average serum PSA > 4 ng/mL based on two separate determinations, or (2) an average change from baseline in serum PSA of greater than 0.75 ng/mL on two determinations.

### Specificity of serum prostate-specific antigen determination in the Finnish prostate cancer screening trial [^113WGFRh]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

RESULTS

In the target population of 80 458 men, 8000 men were randomly allocated to the screening arm each year during the enrolment period, 1996–1999. At the time of the invitation to the first screening round, 30 194 were eligible and invited. Of them, 20 794 (69%) participated in the first screening round. A drop-out analysis showed that young age and residence in Helsinki area were associated with non-participation (mean ages 59.8 vs 60.2 years and 81% vs 72% resident in Helsinki region among non-participants and participants). Of the participants, 18,825 had serum PSA concentration below 3 ng mL −1 or PSA 3.0–3.9 ng mL −1 in combination with negative DRE or free/total ratio ⩾0.16 (Table 1). Thus, the number of screen-positive men was 1968 and prostate cancer was histologically confirmed in 508 subjects. The histological finding was benign in 1358 men and 102 subjects (5.2%) did not undergo biopsy.

Based on these observations, the specificity of the screening test was estimated as (18 825)/(18 825+1358) that is, 0.933 with 95% CI 0.929–0.936 (Table 2). Men without biopsy were excluded from this calculation. Specificity decreased with increasing age, from 0.97 at age 55 to 0.88 at 67 years.

Assuming a similar proportion of cancers and benign findings among the 102 men who were not biopsied as among the screen-positive men who underwent biopsy (102•(508/{508+1,358})), the number of cancers was estimated as 28 and number of men with FP screening test as 74. Therefore, a corrected estimate of the relative specificity of the PSA test was virtually identical to the original: (18 825)/(18 825+1432) = 0.929 (95% CI 0.926–0.933).

### Evaluation of a low-invasive strategy for prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen [^112EMaCk]. Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate a two-step strategy for the detection of prostate cancer within the context of serial screening and compare this strategy with other screening strategies. The optimal combination of tests proposed for prostate cancer screening remains undetermined, particularly when screening is repeated over time.

Methods

A prospective serial prostate cancer screening study with follow-up to 55 months was performed in a general community screening clinic. One thousand seven hundred seven self-referred men, 50 to 75 years old, without a history of prostate cancer agreed to undergo screening for prostate cancer on an annual basis. Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurement was the first-step screening test. If the serum PSA test was positive, a standard urologic evaluation was performed. Biopsy was recommended only if a test other than serum PSA was suspicious for cancer. The outcome measures were the biopsy rate and prostate cancer detection rate. The comparisons with other studies were age-standardized to correct for differences in age distribution.

Results

The biopsy and cancer detection rates after the first test were 7.0% and 2.0%, respectively. After 4 years of the study, the cumulative biopsy rate and cumulative cancer detection rate per enrolled man was 12% and 4.1%, respectively. The comparisons between studies revealed that screening strategies using serum PSA as a first-line test had similar detection rates but lower biopsy rates than strategies performing biopsy when one of several screening tests was positive.

Conclusions

A two-step screening strategy using serum PSA alone as the initial test seemed able to detect as many cancers as when all screening tests were used at the same time but reduced the number of unnecessary biopsies.

### Prostate specific antigen concentration at age 60 and death or metastasis from prostate cancer: case-control study [^114nZyuf]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Table 5
Cumulative proportion (%) of cases (95% confidence intervals) above centiles of prostate specific antigen (PSA) concentration

*Imputed to whole population from case-control data.

Six men in our dataset had prostate specific antigen concentrations of 20 ng/ml or more, and four of these men died of prostate cancer. These men might have had incurable disease at the time of the blood sample and therefore prostate specific antigen based screening at this age would possibly have made little difference to their survival. In a sensitivity analysis, we excluded these six cases but saw no important influence on our findings: the proportion of deaths from cancer in men in the top quarter of prostate specific antigen remained at 90%. The proportion of deaths occurring in the top quarter was also unaffected if we excluded men dying of prostate cancer within five (91%) or 10 (89%) years.

Baseline free prostate specific antigen, free:total prostate specific antigen ratio, and hK2 predicted all three end points. Total prostate specific antigen, however, was the best single marker, and its predictive accuracy was enhanced only by the other kallikrein markers for men with concentrations above the median (table 6).

### Prostate-specific antigen at or before age 50 as a predictor of advanced prostate cancer diagnosed up to 25 years later: a case-control study [^1138Fsvi]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Current US prostate screening guidelines recommend that all men over age 50 who have a life expectancy of at least 10 years should have an annual digital examination and PSA test. Results from ongoing screening trials show that these recommendations result in over-diagnosis and over-treatment. For example, the Rotterdam section of the European Randomized Screening Study for Prostate Cancer have shown that almost 50% of screen-detected cancers are indolent (organ-confined, Gleason 6 or less, and 0.5 cc or less in volume) and thus unlikely to affect a man's survival or quality of life. Over-treatment is associated not only with high morbidity, such as poor erectile, bowel and urinary function resulting from surgery or radiotherapy, but also high healthcare costs. A screening program that focused on those at highest risk of prostate cancer morbidity or mortality might well have a superior benefit-to-harm ratio compared with the current approach of screening all men. One scenario might be to make exceptional efforts to ensure that all men obtain a PSA test in their mid to late forties. Although a man with a PSA elevated above the threshold for biopsy (e.g. 3 ng/ml) could be referred for immediate biopsy, this would be very rare (~1–2% in the current data set); the primary purpose of the early PSA test would be to determine which men should be invited back for regular screening at age 50 and which men advised that PSA screening is unlikely to benefit them.

This study is based on a previously published case-control study in which we attempted to predict the occurrence of prostate cancer at any stage. We did not re-match for this study and hence patients with a prostate cancer diagnosis were not included in the sample from which controls were selected. We note that kallikrein levels of these 301 participants are likely to be higher than those of Malmö Preventive Medicine participants not diagnosed with prostate cancer, thus inflating differences between cases and controls in our current analysis. However, the original Malmö Preventive Medicine cohort contains approximately 21,270 participants who could act as controls, from whom 436 controls were randomly chosen to be included in our current analysis. As there were 462 prostate cancer cases, we would expect prostate cancer patients to comprise approximately 2% of the control group. Therefore, we conclude that our failure to sample from non-advanced prostate cancer cases is unlikely to have any major effect on the current results.

### Effectiveness of the combined evaluation of KLK3 genetics and free-to-total prostate specific antigen ratio for prostate cancer diagnosis [^111uPxbL]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

Of serum prostate specific antigen variability 40% depends on inherited factors. We ascertained whether the knowledge of KLK3 genetics would enhance prostate specific antigen diagnostic performance in patients with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer.

Materials and Methods

We studied 1,058 men who consecutively underwent prostate biopsy for clinical suspicion of prostate cancer. At histology prostate cancer was present in 401 cases and absent in 657. Serum total prostate specific antigen and the free-to-total prostate specific antigen ratio were determined. Four polymorphisms of the KLK3 gene (rs2569733, rs2739448, rs925013 and rs2735839) and 1 polymorphism of the SRD5A2 gene (rs523349) were studied. The influence of genetics on prostate specific antigen variability was evaluated by multivariate linear regression analysis. The performance of total prostate specific antigen and the free-to-total prostate specific antigen ratio alone or combined with a genetically based patient classification were defined by ROC curve analyses.

Results

For prostate cancer diagnosis the free-to-total prostate specific antigen ratio index alone (cutoff 11%) was superior to total prostate specific antigen (cutoff 4 ng/ml) and to free-to-total prostate specific antigen ratio reflex testing (positive predictive value 61%, 43% and 54%, respectively). Prostate specific antigen correlated with KLK3 genetics (rs2735839 polymorphism p = 0.001, and rs2569733, rs2739448 and rs925013 haplotype combination p = 0.003). In patients with different KLK3 genetics 2 optimal free-to-total prostate specific antigen ratio cutoffs (11% and 14.5%) were found. For free-to-total prostate specific antigen ratio values between 11% and 14.5% the prostate cancer probability ranged from 30.0% to 47.4% according to patient genetics.

Conclusions

The free-to-total prostate specific antigen ratio is superior to total prostate specific antigen for prostate cancer diagnosis, independent of total prostate specific antigen results. Free-to-total prostate specific antigen ratio findings below 11% are positively associated with prostate cancer and those above 14.5% are negatively associated with prostate cancer, while the interpretation of those between 11% and 14.5% is improved by patient KLK3 genetic analysis.

### Opportunistic testing versus organized prostate-specific antigen screening: outcome after 18 years in the Göteborg randomized population-based prostate cancer screening trial [^116hNRQp]. European Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

It has been shown that organized screening decreases prostate cancer (PC) mortality, but the effect of opportunistic screening is largely unknown.

Objective

To compare the ability to reduce PC mortality and the risk of overdiagnosis between organized and opportunistic screening.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The Göteborg screening study invited 10 000 randomly selected men for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing every 2 yr since 1995, with a prostate biopsy recommended for men with PSA ≥ 2.5 ng/ml. The control group of 10 000 men not invited has been exposed to a previously reported increased rate of opportunistic PSA testing. Both groups were followed until December 31, 2012.

Outcome Measurements and Statistical Analysis

Observed cumulative PC incidence and mortality rates in both groups were calculated using the actuarial method. Using historical data from 1990–1994 (pre-PSA era), we calculated expected PC incidence and mortality rates in the absence of any PSA testing. The number needed to invite (NNI) and the number needed to diagnose (NND) were calculated by comparing the expected versus observed incidence and mortality rates.

Results and Limitations

At 18 yr, 1396 men were diagnosed with PC and 79 men died of PC in the screening group, compared to 962 and 122, respectively, in the control group. In the screening group, the observed cumulative PC incidence/mortality was 16%/0.98% compared to expected values of 6.8%/1.7%. The corresponding values for the control group were 11%/1.5% and 6.9%/1.7%. Organized screening was associated with an absolute PC-specific mortality reduction of 0.72% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.50–0.94%) and relative risk reduction of 42% (95% CI 28–54%). There was an absolute reduction in PC deaths of 0.20% (95% CI -0.06% to 0.47%) and a relative risk reduction of 12% (95% CI -5 to 26%) associated with opportunistic PSA testing. NNI and NND were 139 (95% CI 107–200) and 13 for organized biennial screening and 493 (95% CI 213- -1563) and 23 for opportunistic screening. The extent of opportunistic screening could not be measured; incidence trends were used as a proxy.

Conclusions

Organized screening reduces PC mortality but is associated with overdiagnosis. Opportunistic PSA testing had little if any effect on PC mortality and resulted in more overdiagnosis, with almost twice the number of men needed to be diagnosed to save one man from dying from PC compared to men offered an organized biennial screening program.

Patient Summary

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening within the framework of an organized program seems more effective than unorganized screening.

### Prostate cancer screening within a prostate specific antigen range of 3 to 3.9 ng. / ml.: a comparison of digital rectal examination and free prostate specific antigen as supplemental screening tests [^116UEj1H]. The Journal of Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

Performing biopsy in all men with a serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) of 3 to 3.9 ng./ml. increases the sensitivity of prostate cancer screening compared with a PSA cutoff of 4 ng./ml. but decreases specificity and may contribute to over diagnosis. Therefore, we evaluated the detection rate and specificity attributable to digital rectal examination and percent free PSA within the PSA range of 3 to 3.9 ng./ml.

Materials and Methods

Serum PSA was determined in 20,716 participants in the Finnish population based screening trial. Supplementary digital rectal examination was offered to men with a PSA of 3 to 3.9 ng./ml. during 1996 to 1998 (protocol 1). Those with a suspicious digital rectal examination finding were referred for biopsy. The screening algorithm was modified by substituting percent free PSA for digital rectal examination with a cutoff of 16% as a biopsy criterion in 1999 (protocol 2). In addition, biopsies were performed in all men with PSA 4 ng./ml. or greater.

Results

A total of 23 cancers (2.9%) were detected by digital rectal examination among 801 men, while percent-free PSA resulted in the diagnosis of 13 cases (4.8%) among 270 men with a PSA of 3 to 3.9 ng./ml. The detection rate of tumors with a Gleason score of 5 or greater increased from 1.6% (13 of 801 cases) to 4.4% (12 of 270) in the modified screening program. The PSA cutoff of 3 ng./ml. alone showed 88.6% and 87.5% specificity in protocols 1 and 2 but specificity increased to 93.3% and 91.7% using digital rectal examination and percent free PSA, respectively.

Conclusions

Using percent free PSA increased the detection rate of aggressive disease compared with digital rectal examination and provided higher specificity than PSA alone.

### Choosing wisely® in preventive medicine: the American College of Preventive Medicine's top 5 list of recommendations [^114yVGty]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Barriers to implementation — The article notes that "Both physicians and patients experience barriers to adoption of recommended best practices in health care", and that "there is a surprisingly low adherence to clinical practice guidelines". Barriers include that "Barriers include the characteristics of clinical practice guidelines, implementing professionals, patients, and the environment", as well as provider attitudes such as "lack of agreement with the guidelines, lack of self-efficacy (lack of training or experience to implement), lack of outcome expectancy, and practice inertia/lack of motivation to change". It also highlights reliance on heuristics and defensive medicine: "Physicians use heuristics to rapidly and reliably address complex medical problems… may include expensive diagnostic algorithms or use of tests with questionable benefits, such as prostate-specific antigen screening or body scans… This also results in overuse of expensive medical prescriptions and procedures". Additionally, "in one study, 89% of providers believed that "doctors need to take an active and more prominent role in limiting use of unnecessary tests".

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^114PZZxT]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

Prostate cancer screening — anxiety and false-positive effects are described as follows: Participants with positive prostate-specific antigen (PSA) results who were waiting for a biopsy had marginally higher anxiety than the general population and had significantly higher cortisol levels, and cancer‑specific questionnaires showed severe anxiety was low (6%) while moderate anxiety was frequent (49%) among those awaiting biopsy; anxiety decreased significantly after negative biopsy results. Two studies and two well designed surveys reported a significantly higher prostate cancer–specific psychological impact and higher short‑term and long‑term cancer worry in men with false‑positive PSA results than in men with true‑negative results, with statistically significant differences at 6 weeks and 1 year after PSA testing and more subsequent tests/visits following a false‑positive test; given the high prevalence of false‑positive screens, these deleterious effects are noted as not inconsequential.

### False-positive screening results in the Finnish prostate cancer screening trial [^117AGWgn]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer (PC) is the most common cancer in most industrialised countries. Its incidence increased steadily from the 1980s onwards, as the increased use of transurethral resection of the prostate for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) resulted in more (incidental) PC diagnoses. A steep rise in the incidence of PC was observed in the 1990s when the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test as a diagnostic tool was adapted widely. Lately, the incidence of PC has been decreasing in many countries.

Screening for PC with PSA has become one of the most controversial public health issues. The two major screening trials in Europe and in the United States have provided inconsistent results concerning the mortality effects of PSA-based PC screening. Although it is essential to determine mortality and the quality-of-life effects of screening, it is also important to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the screening test to ensure best possible screening protocol, that is, maximise the benefits and minimise the harms of screening. The proportion of false-positive (FP) screening results indicates one aspect of adverse effects of screening, in addition to overdiagnosis and overtreatment.

The FP results are related to the specificity of the screening test. Specificity represents the ability of a test or test protocol to identify those free of the target disorder. Specificity is calculated as the ratio of the frequency of the true negative results (those with a negative test and without the target disease) to the sum of the frequencies of the true negatives and FPs (those with a positive test but free of the disease). Hence, the proportion of FP results is 1-specificity.

The FP screening results are common in PC screening, as PSA is an organ-specific but not a disease-specific marker. It has been previously reported that ∼70% of men with elevated PSA do not have PC. The proportion of FP results is likely to increase with age, as prostatic diseases, such as chronic prostatitis and BPH, become more common. The proportion of FP results has been estimated to be 7–8% per screen (with 1 year of follow-up after the test). In repeated screening, the cumulative proportion of FP results was recently estimated at 10.4% with four PSA tests and over 3 years of follow-up.

### The influence of finasteride on the development of prostate cancer [^1178PjzA]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2003). Excellent credibility.

The study PCPT was published by Thompson IM and colleagues in 2003 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Prostate cancer. In the PCPT study, the trial question was: what is the role of finasteride on the development of prostate cancer? In the PCPT study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the PCPT study, the population was: 18882 male patients. The inclusion criteria were men ≥ 55 years with a normal DRE and PSA level ≤ 3.0 ng/mL. The key exclusion criteria were PSA level > 3.0 ng/mL, previous prostate cancer, early termination of the study, or declined biopsy. In the PCPT study, the interventions were: n = 9423 finasteride (5 mg/day for 7 years) n = 9459 placebo (matching placebo for 7 years). In the PCPT study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in the prevalence of prostate cancer over the 7-year period (18.4% vs. 24.4%; RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.81). In the PCPT study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in tumors of Gleason grade 7, 8, 9, or 10 (6.4% vs. 5.1%; RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.5). In the PCPT study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in number of deaths (5 vs. 5). significant difference in sexual side-effects more common in finasteride group (p < 0.001 for all comparisons) and urinary symptoms more common in placebo group (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). In the PCPT study, the conclusion was: in men ≥ 55 years with a normal DRE and PSA level ≤ 3.0 ng/mL, finasteride was superior to placebo with respect to the prevalence of prostate cancer over the 7-year period.

### Influence of blood prostate specific antigen levels at age 60 on benefits and harms of prostate cancer screening: population based cohort study [^115Z9vX6]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with other studies

Our findings are similar to others in the literature. Van Leeuwen and colleagues compared the benefits of screening by baseline PSA level in a screened group in the European Randomized trial of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC), of which the Gothenburg study is a component, with a non-screened population in Northern Ireland. For men with a PSA level between 0.0 and 1.99 ng/mL at study entry, the number needed to screen was extraordinarily high at 24 642, and the number needed to diagnose was similarly high, at 724, making it hard to justify repeat screening for men with these levels. A separate study on the Rotterdam branch of the ERSPC confirms the strong prognostic value of a baseline PSA level. Bul and colleagues reported that men aged 55–74 years who had a PSA level < 3 ng/mL at baseline were 10 times less likely to die from prostate cancer over the next 15 years than men with a higher PSA level (≥ 3 ng/mL). Those with a baseline PSA of < 1 ng/mL had a small risk of dying from the disease (0.04%). Both estimates are comparable to those reported here.

It might be questioned why some men died of prostate cancer despite screening. Excluding six men whose diagnosis followed their first PSA screen, many of whom already had advanced disease, eight men in the screening group subsequently died. All but one had a PSA level > 1.0 ng/mL at baseline. Four men attended several screening visits following the screening protocol (complete attendees) and had PSA detected cancers, though one had a contraindication to prostate biopsy. One man followed the protocol but was diagnosed after termination of screening owing to reaching the upper age limit of 70 years. Another participated at irregular intervals, and two men each had one PSA measurement only. All but one man, who had intermediate risk disease, presented with high risk or locally advanced disease at diagnosis. This illustrates that risk stratification is important, as some men will probably need more intense and prolonged screening whereas many men have an extremely low risk and might stop screening at an early age.

### Long-term results of active surveillance in the Göteborg randomized, population-based prostate cancer screening trial [^112Zp8hV]. European Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Active surveillance (AS) has become a well-accepted and widely used treatment strategy.

Objective

To assess the long-term safety of AS for men with screen-detected prostate cancer (PCa).

Design, Setting, and Participants

All men with screen-detected PCa who had very low-, low-, or intermediate-risk PCa and were managed with AS (January 1, 1995 to December 31, 2014) in the Göteborg screening trial.

Intervention

Prostate-specific antigen tests every 3–12 mo, rebiopsies in cases of clinical progression, and every 2–3 yr in men with stable disease. Triggers for intervention were disease progression (prostate-specific antigen, grade, and/or stage) or patient initiative.

Outcomes Measurements and Statistical Analysis

Treatment-free, failure-free, PCa-specific, and overall survival. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards models were used.

Results and Limitations

Four-hundred and seventy-four men were managed with AS (median age at diagnosis 66.0 yr, median follow-up 8.0 yr). Two-hundred and two men discontinued AS and initiated treatment. The 10-yr and 15-yr treatment-free survival was 47% and 34%, respectively. The hazard ratio for the treatment for low- and intermediate-risk PCa, compared with very low risk, was 1.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01–1.94) and 1.6 (95% CI 1.13–2.25). Fifty-four men failed AS. The 10-yr and 15-year failure-free survival was 87% and 72%, respectively. These estimates were 94% and 88% for the very low-risk group, 85% and 77% for the low-risk group, and 73% and 40% for the intermediate-risk group. The hazard ratio for failure for low- and intermediate-risk PCa, compared with very low-risk, was 2.2 (95% CI 1.05–4.47) and 4.8 (95% CI 2.44–9.33). Six men died from PCa and none had very low-risk PCa. The 10-yr and 15-yr PCa-specific survival was 99.5% and 96%, respectively. These estimates were 100% for the very low-risk group, 100% and 94% for the low-risk group, and 98% and 90% for the intermediate-risk group. No predefined protocol was used.

Conclusions

AS is safe for men with very low-risk PCa, but for men with low- and intermediate-risk PCa, AS carries a risk of missing the possibility of being able to cure the cancer. It is questionable whether men who are not in the lowest tumor risk group and who have a long remaining life expectancy are suitable candidates for this strategy.

Patient Summary

Long-term results from this study indicate that some men will miss their chance of cure with active surveillance and it is questionable whether active surveillance is a suitable strategy for men who are not in the lowest tumor risk group and who have a very long remaining life expectancy.

### Clinical evaluation of the PCA3 assay in guiding initial biopsy decisions [^116Zao1w]. The Journal of Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

We evaluated the clinical utility of the PCA3 assay in guiding initial biopsy decisions in prostate cancer.

Materials and Methods

A European, prospective, multicenter study enrolled men with a serum total prostate specific antigen of 2.5 to 10 ng/ml scheduled for initial biopsy. After digital rectal examination first catch urine was collected. PCA3 scores were determined using the PROGENSA(®) PCA3 assay and compared to biopsy outcome. The diagnostic accuracy of PCA3 was compared to total prostate specific antigen, prostate specific antigen density and %free prostate specific antigen.

Results

In 516 men the positive biopsy rate was 40%. An increasing PCA3 score corresponded with an increasing probability of a positive biopsy. The mean PCA3 score was higher in men with a positive vs a negative biopsy (69.6 vs 31.0, median 50 vs 18, p < 0.0001). The PCA3 score was independent of age, total prostate specific antigen and prostate volume. The PCA3 score (cutoff of 35) had a sensitivity of 64% and specificity of 76%. ROC analysis showed a significantly higher AUC for the PCA3 score vs total prostate specific antigen, prostate specific antigen density and %free prostate specific antigen. The PCA3 score was significantly higher in men with biopsy Gleason score 7 or greater vs less than 7, greater than 33% vs 33% or fewer positive cores and significant vs indolent prostate cancer. Inclusion of PCA3 in multivariable models increased their predictive accuracy by up to 5.5%.

Conclusions

The PROGENSA PCA3 assay can aid in guiding biopsy decisions. It is superior to total prostate specific antigen, prostate specific antigen density and %free prostate specific antigen in predicting initial biopsy outcome, and may be indicative of prostate cancer aggressiveness.

### Is there any association between prostate-specific antigen screening frequency and uptake of active surveillance in men with low or very low risk prostate cancer? [^1164m9Df]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

The main outcome of interest was uptake of AS. For our main analyses we derived the measure of AS uptake from the NPCR based on primary treatment reported to the register 6 months post-diagnosis. When treatment data were missing (n = 485, 11%) men were considered not to have undergone AS. For sensitivity analyses, we reclassified AS based on linkage with the inpatient register to identify men who had undergone radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy as inpatients within 6 months of diagnosis. This resulted in reclassification of four men from the AS group to active treatment and 476 men with unknown treatment to the AS group. This reclassification assumes that men were on AS if treatment data were missing in NPCR and no active treatment was identified in the inpatient register.

Measures of pre-diagnosis PSA and biopsy history were derived from the Stockholm PSA and Biopsy Register. These included: total number of PSA tests; total number of PSA tests excluding any likely repeat tests for abnormal/inconclusive results (i.e. tests within 60 days of the previous PSA test); highest total PSA; PSA velocity (defined as change in total PSA/year from first test to PSA at diagnosis); and number of prior negative biopsies. Biopsies performed within 60 days of diagnosis were considered part of diagnostic workup and were excluded. For the main analysis, all measures were derived for the five-year period before PCa diagnosis to ensure equivalence with respect to period of observation.

Data on potential confounders included: age and year of diagnosis; Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), civil status (married, not married); education level (< high school, high school, post-secondary and university); family history of PCa (any first-degree family member had PCa); symptoms at presentation (yes/no); and risk category (e.g. very low versus low risk). In accordance with Swedish guidelines, very low risk PCa was defined as those with T1c disease, ≤ 4 positive cores (of ≥ 8 cores) and PSA density (total PSA/prostate volume) < 0.15 μl/cm 3. Most men would have been assessed through 8–10 core TRUS biopsy prior to treatment decision. Use of MRI was not specified in the Swedish guidelines during the study period and thus has not been considered as a contributing factor in this study.

### Specificity of serum prostate-specific antigen determination in the Finnish prostate cancer screening trial [^1173rmgj]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

After the first 3 years of screening, DRE was replaced with F/T PSA ratio as ancillary test among men with PSA 3.0–3.9 ng mL −1. The proportion of FP results among men with PSA in this range was 7% with DRE (59 out of 794) and 16% with F/T PSA ratio > 0.16 (44 out of 269). The overall number of SN findings during the three initial years was 14 149 and the number of FP findings 995 (7.0%). During the last year of the first screening round, the corresponding figures were 4540 and 368 (8.1%). Hence, adoption of the F/T PSA to replace DRE was associated with a nonsignificant decrease in specificity of the screening programme, 0.934 (0.930–0.938) vs 0.925 (0.917–0.932) in the first screening round.

Specificity in the second round was slightly lower compared with the first round (Table 3). A total of 18 612 men were screened and 2303 screen-positive subjects referred to biopsy. Of them, 2156 were biopsied within the study (at the screening centres) and 583 cancers (3.1%) detected. Overall, specificity was 0.912 (95% CI 0.908–0.916, Table 4). Correction for missing biopsy results did not materially affect the estimate (corrected specificity 0.910, 95% CI 0.906–0.914). In men who attended screening for the first time (i.e. were non-participants in the first round), specificity was 0.903 (95% CI 0.891–0.914), with a corrected estimate of 0.911 (0.900–0.921). Similar to the first screening round, specificity decreased with age. However, no obvious difference in specificity was found within age group, that is, when comparing men at the same age in the first vs second round. Specificity in the two screening rounds remained comparable (0.917 and 0.922) after restricting the analysis to the three age groups targeted in both rounds (59, 63 and 67 years, Figure 1). This suggests that the decrease in sensitivity between the screening rounds was due to the older age structure alone.

### Prostate specific antigen and biopsy contamination in the Göteborg-1 randomized, population-based, prostate cancer screening trial [^115LXySb]. The Journal of Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Even when a screening study has demonstrated a mortality reduction, the degree of pre-testing and contamination is of importance as it can dilute the "true" effect of screening. Our object was to describe the level of pre-testing and contamination in the Göteborg-1 prostate cancer screening trial.

Materials and Methods

A total of 20,000 men, 50–64 years old, were invited in 1994 and randomized to either a screening group (offered prostate specific antigen testing every 2 years) or to a control group. Follow-up was through December 31, 2014. Outcome measurement was overall testing in the screening group and control group. A positive prostate specific antigen test was defined as a prostate specific antigen ≥ 3 ng/ml.

Results

In the study, 4.2% in the screening group and 4.6% men in the control group were tested before study start. During follow-up, 72% in the control group took at least 1 prostate specific antigen test (contamination) compared to 87% of men in the screening group. Of all prostate specific antigens, 24% in the screening group and 39% in the control group were above threshold. In total, 66% of the men underwent prostate biopsy within 12 months from a raised prostate specific antigen in the screening group and 28% in the control group.

Conclusions

Similar proportions of men were prostate specific antigen-tested in both the screening group and control group, yet only a minority of contamination prostate specific antigens led to biopsy. Also, men in the screening group started screening at a younger age. These could both be explanations for our result that organized screening is more effective in reducing prostate cancer mortality than non-organized testing. When carried out properly and compared to an unscreened population, the effects of organized screening are likely even greater than previously shown in the Göteborg screening trial.

### Association between smoking status, and free, total and percent free prostate specific antigen [^114w5m8G]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

There are scant data available on the relationship between smoking and total prostate specific antigen, free prostate specific antigen and percent-free prostate specific antigen. Given the high prevalence of smoking and the frequency of prostate specific antigen screening, it is important to determine any association between smoking and prostate specific antigen values using nationally representative data.

Materials and Methods

Included in the final study population were 3,820 men 40 years old or older who participated in the 2001–2006 NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) and met the eligibility criteria for prostate specific antigen testing. The distributions of total, free and percent free prostate specific antigen were estimated by sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Multivariate linear regression models were fit to determine the adjusted relationship between smoking and total and percent free prostate specific antigen while simultaneously controlling for these characteristics.

Results

For all ages combined the median total and free prostate specific antigen levels were 0.90 (0.81–0.90) and 0.26 (0.25–0.28) ng/ml, respectively. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that total prostate specific antigen was 7.9% and 12.2% lower among current and former smokers, respectively, than among never smokers. High body mass index and diabetes were also statistically significantly associated with a lower total prostate specific antigen. Approximately a third of the men had a percent free prostate specific antigen less than 25%. Current smokers had a significantly lower percent free prostate specific antigen than former smokers.

Conclusions

Our finding that smoking is inversely associated with total prostate specific antigen may have potential implications for the interpretation of prostate specific antigen levels in men who are current or former smokers. Given the high prevalence of smoking, obesity and diabetes, additional research on the combined effect of these health risk factors is warranted.

### Testosterone [^117GNHBm]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

During the 182-day, double-blind period of the clinical trial, the mean change in serum PSA value was 0.14 ng/mL for patients receiving testosterone gel, 1.62% and -0.12 ng/mL for the patients in the placebo group. During the double-blind period, seven patients had a PSA value > 4.0 ng/mL, four of these seven patients had PSA less than or equal to 4.0 ng/mL upon repeat testing. The other three patients did not undergo repeat PSA testing.

During the 182-day, open-label period of the study, the mean change in serum PSA values was 0.10 ng/mL for both patients continuing on active therapy and patients transitioning onto active from placebo. During the open-label period, three patients had a serum PSA value > 4.0 ng/mL, two of whom had a serum PSA less than or equal to 4.0 ng/mL upon repeated testing. The other patient did not undergo repeat PSA testing. Among previous placebo patients, 3 of 28 (10.7%), had increased PSA as an adverse event in the open-label period.

Table 4 shows adverse reactions reported by > 2% of patients in the 182-day, double-blind period of the testosterone gel, 1.62% clinical trial and more frequent in the testosterone gel, 1.62% treated group versus placebo.

### 2023 Canadian Urological Association guideline: genetic testing in prostate cancer [^114ZyfC5]. Canadian Urological Association Journal = Journal de L'Association des Urologues du Canada (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for prostate cancer, more specifically with respect to germline testing, general indications, CUA 2023 guidelines recommend to assess the following genes as a minimum in genomic profiling of the tumor in patients with prostate cancer meeting tumor testing criteria: BRCA1, BRCA2, and ATM. Align tumor testing panels with germline testing panels as much as possible and ideally include also CHEK2, EPCAM (large deletions), HOXB13, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PALB2, PMS2, TP53, and RAD51D, as well as CDK12 for prognostic purposes. Consider assessing additional genes for research purposes, prognostic purposes, or inclusion of patients in clinical trials.

### Effect of prostate-specific antigen screening on metastatic disease burden 10 years after diagnosis [^112zdwBr]. Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the effect of prostate-specific antigen screening on the development of metastatic disease after treatment relative to 1992, the year that prostate-specific antigen screening was recommended by the American Urological Association. Screening for cancer of the prostate (CaP) with prostate-specific antigen has been questioned because of its modest impact on survival in two randomized trials. Its impact on the metastatic disease burden in a population was not assessed. To account for lead-time bias, we compared the 10-year metastasis-free survival rate for the prescreening era group (PRE) to the 15-year metastases-free survival rate of the postscreening era group (POST).

Methods

From 1986 to 1996, a total of 1721 CaP patients were definitively treated at our institution. The cohort was divided into PRE (1986–1992; n = 575) and POST (1993–1996; n = 1146). PRE patients were censored at 10 years, and POST patients were censored at 15 years. The 10- and 15-year metastasis-free survival rate and the characteristics associated with the risk of developing metastatic disease were assessed.

Results

Median follow up for all patients was 10 years (range 0.1–15 years), 9.6 years (range 0.1–10 years) for PRE, and 10.25 years (range 0.1–15 years) for POST. The 10-year PRE versus 15-year POST metastasis-free survival rate was 58% versus 65% for high-risk (P < .0001), 79% versus 86% for intermediate-risk (P < .0001), and 90% versus 96% (P = .0001) for low-risk patients. On multivariable analysis, screening era (P < .0001, hazard ratio = 4.2, 95% confidence interval = 3.1–5.7), T-stage, biopsy Gleason score, and post-treatment prostate-specific antigen testing frequency were significant for the development of metastatic disease.

Conclusion

The implementation of prostate-specific antigen screening in this population is associated with a decrease in metastatic disease.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^111MLjaC]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

Shared and informed decision making (IDM/SDM) for prostate cancer screening involves collaboration between the patient and health care provider, and health care providers have a particularly important role in the decision for or against testing. Providers can provide men with information on the benefits, limitations, and uncertainties, help men integrate knowledge of benefits and risks with their values to make a decision, and when a man prefers a less active role the provider may use his or her discretion in deciding whether to recommend screening and should incorporate any knowledge of the patient's health preferences and values. Although there are no established criteria for all key information, core elements identified by review and expert consensus should be included in patient discussions and decision aids. Offering values‑oriented scenarios is one technique to help men integrate values with information; while there is no evidence to support superiority of this approach, randomized trial evidence shows a values‑matching decision aid can help to lower men's decisional conflict. Key obstacles to IDM/SDM cited by providers are time constraints and the complexity of the issue, and survey findings showed prostate cancer discussions often did not meet recommended criteria because they were not balanced and typically did not engage men to determine personal preferences. Patient decision aids can serve as effective adjunctive tools; the ideal decision aid should provide balanced information regarding screening options, reflect up‑to‑date information regarding benefits and risks, provide methods for clarifying values, and suggest ways to discuss the decision with health care providers. Decision aids are available in print, web‑based, and CD format, and low‑literacy versions have been developed but are not yet widely available. Criteria for selecting high‑quality decision aids are available from the International Patient Decision Aids Standards (IPDAS) Collaboration; several aids have been evaluated against these criteria and those accessible online are listed in Table 1. When selecting a tool, it is important that it reflects the latest key information or that the health care provider is able to supplement an otherwise effective tool with the latest data.

### Measurement of serum total and free prostate-specific antigen in women with colorectal carcinoma [^111pwa8p]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

Statistics

The serum total and free PSA levels of 30 healthy women were arranged in sequence from the lowest to highest and the marker concentrations of the 28th woman were accepted as cut-off values (specificity 93.3%). Marker levels exceeding these cut-off values were considered as positive. Cases with a free PSA/total PSA ratio over 50% were titled 'free PSA predominant subject'.

Mann–Whitney U -Wilcoxon Rank Sum W test was used for comparisons of total PSA or free PSA levels between colorectal carcinoma patients and healthy women. The effect of age on total PSA and free PSA levels was investigated using Spearman correlation analysis. Fisher exact test was used for comparison of free PSA predominancy between carcinoma patients and healthy women. Chi-square test and Fisher exact test were used to assess the association between clinicopathological factors and total PSA positivity, free PSA positivity or free PSA predominancy. P -values of less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.

### Specificity of serum prostate-specific antigen determination in the Finnish prostate cancer screening trial [^113zdoZS]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Some alternative screening algorithms can also be evaluated, based on number of screen-positive findings. Had a cutoff limit of 3 ng mL −1 been used, the number of test-positive men would have been increased from 1980 (9.5%) to 2762 (13.3%) in the first screening round. For the second screening round, the number of screen-positive tests with a cutoff level of 3 ng mL −1 would have increased from 2303 to 3401 compared with the current protocol (12.3% vs 18.3% screen positive).

Age-specific cutoff levels (3.5 ng mL −1 for ages 55–59 and 4.5 ng mL −1 for 63–67) would have resulted in 287 fewer screen-positive findings (from 1980 to 1693, i.e. from 9.5 to 8.1%) in the first screening round, that is, slightly lower compared with the current screening protocol. The number of screen-positive results would have increased for men in their fifties and decreased for older men. In the second screening round with 4 years older subjects, age-specific cutoff levels would have increased the number of screen-positive findings by 557 compared with the protocol used in the trial (from 2303 to 2860 i.e. from 12.4 to 15.4%).

### Measurement of serum total and free prostate-specific antigen in women with colorectal carcinoma [^116dMef7]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

We investigated the diagnostic value and the relationship with clinicopathological features of total and free prostate-specific antigen by measuring the concentrations of these markers in the sera of 75 women with colorectal carcinoma and in 30 healthy women. Measurements were performed by immunoradiometric assay which utilizes monoclonal and polyclonal anti-prostate-specific antigen antibodies; the lowest detection level for both markers was 0.01 ng mL −1. Free prostate-specific antigen levels were significantly higher in women with colorectal carcinoma than healthy women (P = 0.006). The percentage of free prostate-specific antigen predominant (free prostate-specific antigen/total prostate-specific antigen > 50%) subjects was 20% in colorectal carcinoma patients and 3.3% in healthy women (P = 0.035). Cut-off values were 0.34 ng mL −1 for total prostate-specific antigen and 0.01 ng mL −1 for free prostate-specific antigen. In women with colorectal carcinoma, total prostate-specific antigen positivity was 20% and free prostate-specific antigen positivity was 34.6%. When compared to negatives, total prostate-specific antigen positive patients had a lower percentage of well-differentiated (P = 0.056) and early stage (stages I and II) tumours (P = 0.070). However, patients with predominant free prostate-specific antigen, had a higher percentage of well-differentiated (P = 0.014) and early stage tumours (P = 0.090) than patients with predominant bound prostate-specific antigen. In conclusion, although the sensitivity of free prostate-specific antigen predominancy is low (20%), in distinguishing women with colorectal carcinoma than healthy women, its specificity is high (96.7%). Free prostate-specific antigen predominancy tends to be present in less aggressive tumours. These findings may indicate clinical significance of preoperative measurement of serum total and free prostate-specific antigen in women with colorectal carcinoma.

### Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of prognostic markers in prostate cancer [^112WWJR5]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

Figure 3
Threshold analysis showing cost per QALY of £30000 for ploidy marker selection policy compared with observation by test sensitivity and specificity.

illustrates the threshold combinations of sensitivities and specificities that produce a cost per QALY of £30 000. Combinations above and to the right of the isoquant indicate costs per QALY below £30 000, and vice versa below and to the left of the isoquant. The ICER is clearly more responsive to changes in specificity than to sensitivity, and the marker test is cost-effective for all combinations examined when the specificity is 78% or greater. For sensitivity and specificity values tested, the number of QALYs from the marker-based treatment policy never falls below the total achieved in the surgery policy central scenario.

Using a threshold ICER of £30 000/QALY, the sensitivity of the ICERs for the marker-based selection policy with respect to observation, and for the 'surgery for all' policy with respect to the marker policy were tested using threshold analysis. The results of the analysis are presented in Table 4

Table 4
Threshold sensitivity analyses. The results indicate that the central scenario cost-effective result for the marker policy is pretty robust for all variables except the utility values for quality-of-life when living with the knowledge of having localised prostate cancer, and impotence following prostatectomy. The former needs only to vary from its central value of 0.72 outside the range 0.69–0.75 to render the cost-effectiveness of ploidy doubtful compared to the alternative policies. Likewise, the central value for impotence utility can only vary from 0.69 within the range 0.63–0.76. Table4 indicates that many of the modelled input variables can be changed to their extremes, and still the policy of 'radical prostatectomy for all' does not become cost effective compared to the selective marker-based policy. The shaded boxes highlight those results where a feasible threshold value has been achieved, but where radical prostatectomy is still dominated by the observation treatment policy.

### Serum index test% [-2] proPSA and prostate health index are more accurate than prostate specific antigen and% fPSA in predicting a positive repeat prostate biopsy [^111FAgrA]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

We tested the hypothesis that serum isoform [-2]proPSA derivatives %p2PSA and Prostate Health Index are accurate predictors of prostate cancer in men scheduled for repeat biopsy.

Materials and Methods

The study was an observational prospective evaluation of a clinical cohort of men with 1 or 2 previous negative prostate biopsies, with persistent suspicion of prostate cancer. They were enrolled in the study to determine the diagnostic accuracy of %p2PSA using the formula, (p2PSA pg/ml)/(free prostate specific antigen ng/ml × 1,000)]× 100, and Beckman-Coulter Prostate Health Index using the formula, (p2PSA/free prostate specific antigen) × √total prostate specific antigen), and to compare it with the accuracy of established prostate cancer serum tests (total prostate specific antigen, free prostate specific antigen and percent free prostate specific antigen). Multivariable logistic regression models were complemented by predictive accuracy analysis and decision curve analysis.

Results

Prostate cancer was found in 71 of 222 (31.9%) subjects. %p2PSA and Prostate Health Index were the most accurate predictors of disease. %p2PSA significantly outperformed total prostate specific antigen, free prostate specific antigen, percent free prostate specific antigen and p2PSA in the prediction of prostate cancer (p ≤ 0.01), but not Prostate Health Index (p = 0.094). Prostate Health Index significantly outperformed total prostate specific antigen and p2PSA (p ≤ 0.001) but not free prostate specific antigen (p = 0.109) and free/total prostate specific antigen (p = 0.136). In multivariable logistic regression models %p2PSA and Prostate Health Index achieved independent predictor status, and significantly increased the accuracy of multivariable models including prostate specific antigen and prostate volume with or without percent free prostate specific antigen and prostate specific antigen density by 8% to 11% (p ≤ 0.034). At a %p2PSA cutoff of 1.23, 153 (68.9%) biopsies could have been avoided, missing prostate cancer in 6 patients. At a Prostate Health Index cutoff of 28.8, 116 (52.25%) biopsies could have been avoided, missing prostate cancer in 6 patients.

Conclusions

Serum %p2PSA and Prostate Health Index are more accurate than standard reference tests in predicting repeat prostate biopsy outcome, and could avoid unnecessary repeat biopsies.

### Comparison of fresh frozen serum to proficiency testing material in college of American pathologists surveys: α-fetoprotein, carcinoembryonic antigen, human chorionic gonadotropin, and prostate-specific antigen [^111ig13v]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Context

Most proficiency testing materials (PTM) contain an artificial matrix that may cause immunoassays to perform differently with this material than with clinical samples. We hypothesized that matrix effects would be reduced by using fresh frozen serum (FFS).

Objective

To compare the performance of an FFS pool to standard PTM for measurement of alpha-fetoprotein, carcinoembryonic antigen, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA).

Design

One FFS specimen and 4 different admixtures of PTM were distributed in the 2003 College of American Pathologists K/KN-A (for alpha-fetoprotein, carcinoembryonic antigen, hCG, and total and free PSA) and C-C (hCG only) Surveys.

Participants

The number of laboratories that participated in the surveys varied from a low of 288 (free PSA, K/KN-A Survey) to a high of 2659 (hCG, C-C Survey).

Main Outcome Measures

Method imprecision and method bias were compared between the FFS specimen and the standard PTM specimen with the closest value. Method imprecision was determined by calculating the coefficients of variation for each method and for all methods combined. Bias was defined as the proportional difference between peer-group mean and the median of all method means.

Results

The FFS specimen gave significantly higher imprecision than PTM for the analytes alpha-fetoprotein, carcinoembryonic antigen, total PSA, and free PSA. For hCG, no substantial imprecision differences were observed in both surveys. Bias was significantly greater for the alpha-fetoprotein, carcinoembryonic antigen, and total PSA assays and significantly lower for the hCG and free PSA assays when comparing the FFS with the PTM.

Conclusions

Fresh frozen serum did not provide consistently lower imprecision or bias than standard PTM in a survey of commonly ordered tumor markers.

### Effect of flexible cystoscopy on serum prostate-specific antigen values [^1115L6hZ]. Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the effect of flexible cystoscopy on the total, free, and percent-free prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values in male volunteers. Flexible cystoscopy is the standard method of evaluation of the bladder and urethra. PSA measurement is currently used in conjunction with the digital rectal examination to detect and guide management of prostate cancer. Thus, we must understand the effect of flexible cystoscopy on serum PSA levels.

Methods

Healthy men who were undergoing flexible cystoscopy and provided informed consent were enrolled in the study. The volunteers had blood taken for PSA measurement before cystoscopy and 1 and 24 hours after. The mean PSA values were compared using the paired t test.

Results

A total of 40 volunteers (age 22–82 years) enrolled in the study. Statistically significant increases in the total, free, and percent-free PSA values were noted at 1 and 24 hours after cystoscopy. The differences of 0.113 and 0.112 ng/mL (P < .05) in the mean total PSA level at 1 and 24 hours after cystoscopy were not clinically significant. The interassay variability was 0.053 ng/mL, with a standard deviation of 0.150 ng/mL. The standard deviation of 0150 ng/mL was greater than the 0.113- and 0.112-ng/mL differences seen in the total PSA values at 1 and 24 hours after cystoscopy.

Conclusions

Statistically significant differences were noted in the total, free, and percent-free PSA levels before and after cystoscopy. Although these small differences achieved statistical significance, none were clinically significant. We have concluded that the serum PSA values are not affected by diagnostic flexible cystoscopy.
