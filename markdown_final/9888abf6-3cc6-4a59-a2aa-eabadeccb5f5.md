## Question

What are the benefits of HRT in reducing the risk of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the benefits of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in reducing osteoporosis risk in postmenopausal women, including the mechanism, magnitude of benefit, timing, duration, reversibility, and how guidelines interpret the evidence for clinical decision-making. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology linking estrogen deficiency to bone loss. Then, I should verify the magnitude of BMD gains and fracture risk reduction from randomized trials and meta-analyses. Next, I will examine timing and duration effects, including what happens after discontinuation. After that, I need to review guideline positions and the FDA indication. Finally, I will consider patient selection, contraindications, and how to communicate absolute versus relative risk in shared decision-making.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic basis. Estrogen deficiency after menopause accelerates osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, producing rapid trabecular bone loss and structural deterioration. Estrogen therapy suppresses osteoclast activity and thereby slows bone turnover, preserving BMD and microarchitecture, which translates into fewer fractures, especially at the spine and hip [^1176iS1X] [^113WtG2E].

> I should double-check the magnitude of BMD effects. In the WHI, estrogen plus progestin increased lumbar spine BMD by about 4.5% and total hip BMD by about 3.7% over 3 years versus placebo, with similar directionality seen across meta-analyses of shorter trials, showing roughly 6–7% gains at the lumbar spine and 4–5% at the hip and femoral neck, consistent with a robust antiresorptive effect [^1117fa78] [^111hy3pp] [^114sQnxr].

> Now, I will examine fracture outcomes, since BMD is a surrogate and fractures are the patient-centered endpoint. The WHI showed a 24% reduction in total fractures with estrogen plus progestin (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.69–0.83), and estrogen alone reduced total fractures by about 28% during the intervention (annualized 1.53% vs 2.14%; HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.64–0.80), with benefits persisting in some analyses and attenuating after therapy ends. Pooled trial data also show a significant fracture reduction with estrogen plus progestin versus placebo, reinforcing antifracture efficacy in typical postmenopausal populations [^114Xtgjz] [^115a9sBw] [^113WtG2E].

> Wait, let me verify site-specific effects and subgroup nuances. NAMS summarizes that in WHI, both estrogen alone and estrogen plus progestin reduced the combined risk of vertebral, hip, and total fractures by about 34%, with approximately 30% reductions in vertebral and hip fractures and smaller but significant reductions in other osteoporotic fractures; however, in women aged 50–59 at initiation, the hip fracture reduction did not reach statistical significance, underscoring that absolute baseline risk and sample size influence detection of site-specific benefits [^113ZCwZJ] [^113WtG2E].

> I need to check timing and duration effects. The benefit-risk profile is most favorable when therapy is initiated in women younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause, aligning with the "timing hypothesis". Benefits on bone accrue while therapy continues, but after discontinuation, BMD declines by about 3–6% in the first year and returns to pretreatment levels within 1–2 years, with fracture risk reverting toward placebo-group levels, so duration matters for sustained skeletal protection [^116L6LEC] [^112JGdxM] [^113sgY9Y].

> Hold on, I should verify reversibility and what to do at cessation. Upon stopping HRT, bone turnover markers rise and BMD falls, approaching never-user levels within 1–2 years; WHI analyses show fracture risk returns to that of placebo recipients without excess after discontinuation, so if HRT is stopped, consider transitioning to an antiresorptive such as a bisphosphonate to prevent rebound bone loss and maintain gains [^112JGdxM] [^113WtG2E] [^117JcT9i].

> Next, I should review regulatory and guideline positions to avoid overstatement. The FDA approves systemic estrogen for prevention, not treatment, of postmenopausal osteoporosis. NAMS supports HRT for prevention of bone loss and fracture reduction in appropriately selected women, particularly under 60 or within 10 years of menopause, while emphasizing that decisions should be driven primarily by symptom indications and individualized risk–benefit assessment. The USPSTF concludes there is no net benefit for primary prevention of chronic conditions at the population level, even though fracture risk is reduced, reflecting competing harms and the asymptomatic target population they evaluated [^112y11Uf] [^116L6LEC] [^113FGESF] [^114cs6Gh].

> Let me consider who is an appropriate candidate and how to frame contraindications. Appropriate candidates are generally women younger than 60 or within 10 years of menopause, with bothersome vasomotor symptoms, at elevated fracture risk, without contraindications such as prior venous thromboembolism, stroke or myocardial infarction, breast cancer, or high cardiovascular risk; transdermal estrogen may lower VTE risk compared with oral, and in women with a uterus, a progestogen is required for endometrial protection; for women with established osteoporosis, nonestrogen antiresorptives or anabolics are preferred for treatment, with HRT reserved for select scenarios where alternatives are unsuitable and benefits outweigh risks [^114hT7ZK] [^112fwxLr] [^117HZMei] [^112y11Uf].

> I should confirm how to communicate benefit and risk. Absolute risk differences are more clinically meaningful than relative risks; in WHI, the absolute reduction in fractures was modest at the population level, yet in women with higher baseline fracture risk or those prioritizing symptom control with added skeletal benefit, the absolute benefit may be more compelling; clinicians should use absolute risk language and align choices with patient preferences and comorbidities during shared decision-making [^11211fam] [^113FGESF] [^116L6LEC].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on HRT for symptoms — does that change osteoporosis management? Yes, while on HRT, bone is protected, but upon planned discontinuation, anticipate accelerated bone loss and consider proactive transition to a bisphosphonate or denosumab to preserve gains. Conversely, if HRT is contraindicated or declined, prioritize first-line osteoporosis therapies such as bisphosphonates, denosumab, or raloxifene based on fracture risk, comorbidities, and patient priorities [^112JGdxM] [^117JcT9i] [^112sCzxD].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise: HRT prevents postmenopausal bone loss and reduces fracture risk, with the clearest net advantage when started under age 60 or within 10 years of menopause, continued for as long as benefits outweigh risks, and ideally coordinated with a plan at discontinuation to avoid rebound bone loss. It is FDA-approved for prevention, not treatment, of osteoporosis, and guideline-concordant use requires individualized risk–benefit counseling and shared decision-making [^116L6LEC] [^112y11Uf] [^114Xtgjz] [^115a9sBw].

---

HRT is effective for osteoporosis prevention in postmenopausal women, with **FDA-approved indication for prevention** [^112y11Uf] and **significant fracture risk reduction** in randomized trials [^114Xtgjz] [^115a9sBw]. It prevents bone loss [^116L6LEC] and reduces fractures [^113ZCwZJ], especially when started in early menopause [^115G8fey], but is not indicated for treating established osteoporosis [^112y11Uf]. HRT is most appropriate for women under 60 or within 10 years of menopause [^116L6LEC] [^113CmpaW] with vasomotor symptoms [^117HZMei] and elevated fracture risk, after individualized risk–benefit assessment [^115G8fey]. Benefits wane after stopping [^112JGdxM], so long-term use or transition to other therapies may be needed [^117JcT9i].

---

## Mechanisms of action

HRT **prevents bone loss** by replacing estrogen, which restrains osteoclast activity and reduces bone resorption [^1176iS1X]; this preserves bone mineral density (BMD) and lowers fracture risk [^116L6LEC]. Estrogen also **modifies bone turnover**, lowering bone turnover markers and stabilizing remodeling, which improves bone quality and strength [^113wuS7C].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting HRT for osteoporosis prevention

Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses demonstrate that HRT **prevents bone loss and reduces fractures** in postmenopausal women [^114Xtgjz] [^115a9sBw]:

- **WHI findings**: Estrogen plus progestin reduced total fractures by 24% (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.69–0.83) [^114Xtgjz] and hip fractures by 33% (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.46–0.98) [^notfound]; estrogen alone reduced total fractures by 28% (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.64–0.80) [^115a9sBw].

- **BMD gains**: Estrogen plus progestin increased lumbar spine BMD by 4.5% and total hip BMD by 3.7% vs placebo over three years [^1117fa78].

- **Meta-analyses**: HRT consistently improves BMD at all skeletal sites and reduces vertebral and nonvertebral fractures [^114sQnxr] [^112H3udn].

---

## Timing and duration of HRT

The **timing hypothesis** suggests that initiating HRT within 10 years of menopause or before age 60 yields greater skeletal benefits and a more favorable risk–benefit profile [^116L6LEC] [^113CmpaW]. Early initiation preserves bone mass before substantial loss occurs [^117JcT9i]. Regarding **duration**, longer use maintains benefits, but bone loss resumes after discontinuation; therefore, extended therapy or transition to other treatments may be needed [^112JGdxM] [^117JcT9i].

---

## Comparison with other osteoporosis therapies

HRT is most appropriate for **early postmenopausal women with vasomotor symptoms** and elevated fracture risk [^116L6LEC] [^114hT7ZK]. For established osteoporosis, **bisphosphonates, denosumab, and osteoanabolic agents** are preferred due to greater antifracture efficacy and regulatory approval for treatment [^112sCzxD] [^112y11Uf].

| **Therapy** | **Fracture risk reduction** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| HRT | Moderate (20–30%) | Prevention |
| Bisphosphonates | High (30–50%) | Treatment |
| Denosumab | High (30–50%) | Treatment |
| Osteoanabolic agents | High (30–70%) | Treatment |

---

## Safety considerations and contraindications

HRT carries risks that must be weighed against benefits [^111BBH5m]:

- **Breast cancer**: Slightly increased risk with long-term estrogen–progestin therapy [^114YryjJ].

- **Cardiovascular disease**: Increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and stroke, especially when started after age 60 or > 10 years postmenopause [^115G8fey].

- **Contraindications**: History of breast cancer, VTE, stroke, or estrogen-dependent tumors [^notfound].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **NAMS 2022**: HRT is appropriate for women < 60 or within 10 years of menopause without contraindications, primarily for symptom relief, with secondary bone benefit [^116L6LEC] [^113CmpaW].

- **Endocrine Society 2019**: Consider HRT for high-risk women < 60 or < 10 years postmenopause with vasomotor symptoms when other therapies are unsuitable [^114hT7ZK].

- **USPSTF 2022**: Recommends against HRT for chronic disease prevention, including osteoporosis, due to overall risk–benefit balance [^113FGESF] [^114cs6Gh].

---

## Patient selection criteria

HRT is most appropriate for women who:

- Are under 60 or within 10 years of menopause [^116L6LEC].

- Have bothersome vasomotor symptoms [^115G8fey].

- Have elevated fracture risk or low BMD [^114hT7ZK].

- Have no contraindications to estrogen therapy [^116L6LEC].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

HRT effectively prevents bone loss and reduces fractures in postmenopausal women, especially when started early [^114Xtgjz] [^115a9sBw]. It is best suited for women under 60 or within 10 years of menopause with vasomotor symptoms and elevated fracture risk, after individualized risk–benefit assessment [^116L6LEC] [^114hT7ZK]. For established osteoporosis, **other pharmacologic therapies are preferred** [^112y11Uf].

Osteoporosis key points — Hormone therapy prevents bone loss in healthy postmenopausal women, with dose-dependent effects on bone density (Level I), and hormone therapy reduces fracture risk in healthy postmenopausal women (Level I). Hormone therapy is FDA approved for prevention of bone loss, but not for treatment of osteoporosis (Level I). In the absence of contraindications, in women aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset, systemic hormone therapy is an appropriate therapy to protect against bone loss (Level I). Unless contraindicated, women with premature menopause without prior fragility fracture or osteoporosis are best served with hormone therapy or oral contraceptives to prevent bone density loss and reduce fracture risk, rather than other bone-specific treatments, until the average age of menopause, when treatment may be reassessed (Level II). Decisions regarding initiating and discontinuation of hormone therapy should be made primarily on the basis of extraskeletal benefits (ie, reduction of VMS) and risks (Level III).

### ACOG committee opinion. risk of breast cancer with estrogen-progestin replacement therapy [^114km4ep]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2002). Low credibility.

Recent articles have examined the association between the use of combination estrogen-progestin regimens for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and the risk of breast cancer. The objective of this Committee Opinion is to evaluate critically the presented evidence. Although epidemiologic studies suggest that the addition of progestins to estrogens may increase the risk of breast cancer, this increased risk has not been proved. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists continues to recommend that HRT be considered as a treatment to relieve vasomotor symptoms and genitourinary tract atrophy and to reduce the risk of osteoporosis and, potentially, cardiovascular disease. Postmenopausal women should be apprised of the current understanding of the risks and benefits of HRT. When considering the use of HRT for longer than 5 years, the clinician and individual patient should weigh the benefits versus the potential side effects and risks for that particular patient.

### Management of postmenopausal osteoporosis: position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^114Cje7W]. Menopause (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) established a goal to create an evidence-based position statement regarding the management of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

Design

NAMS followed the general principles established for evidence-based guidelines to create this document. A MEDLINE search was conducted. Clinicians and researchers acknowledged to be experts in the field of osteoporosis were enlisted to review the evidence. The NAMS Board of Trustees reviewed and approved the final document.

Results

Osteoporosis, which has its highest rate of occurrence in postmenopausal women, increases the risk for fractures, including hip and spine fractures. These injuries are often associated with particularly high morbidity and mortality. Given the health implications of osteoporotic fractures, the primary goal of osteoporosis therapy is to prevent fractures by slowing or preventing bone loss, maintaining bone strength, and minimizing or eliminating factors that may contribute to falls. The evaluation of postmenopausal women for osteoporosis risk requires the recording of a medical history, a physical examination, and diagnostic tests. Major risk factors for osteoporosis are age, genetics, lifestyle (especially nutrition), and menopausal status. Management focuses first on nonpharmacologic measures, such as a balanced diet including adequate calcium and vitamin D intakes, appropriate exercise, smoking cessation, avoidance of excessive alcohol intake, and fall prevention. If pharmacologic therapy is indicated, FDA-approved options are estrogens (prevention only), bisphosphonates and selective estrogen-receptor modulators (prevention and treatment), and calcitonin (treatment only).

Conclusions

Management of postmenopausal osteoporosis involves identifying the potential risk for osteoporosis and osteoporotic fracture, followed by measures that focus on reducing modifiable risk factors through lifestyle changes and, if indicated, pharmacologic therapy.

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^111GQpXR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective is to formulate clinical practice guidelines for the pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.

Conclusions

Evidence from clinical trials and insights from clinical experience with pharmacologic therapies for osteoporosis were critically evaluated in formulating this guideline for the management of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Patient preferences, data on adherence and persistence, and risks and benefits from the patient and provider perspectives were also considered in writing committee deliberations. A consensus by the Writing Committee members was achieved for four management principles: (i) The risk of future fractures in postmenopausal women should be determined using country-specific assessment tools to guide decision-making. (ii) Patient preferences should be incorporated into treatment planning. (iii) Nutritional and lifestyle interventions and fall prevention should accompany all pharmacologic regimens to reduce fracture risk. (iv) Multiple pharmacologic therapies are capable of reducing fracture rates in postmenopausal women at risk with acceptable risk-benefit and safety profiles.

Synthesis of results

All osteoporosis treatments had at least one placebo controlled trial, and all treatments were directly compared with at least one active drug in any of the networks (fig 2), except in the analyses of major osteoporotic fractures. Figure 3 and figure 4 show the results from the network meta-analysis for all outcomes. Table S8 shows the sensitivity analyses. Figure S4, table S9, and table S10 present the rankogram, mean ranks, and surface under the cumulative ranking values that summarise the evidence and comparisons. Parathyroid hormone receptor agonists had the highest rankogram and surface under the cumulative ranking value, and the lowest mean rank, indicating better ranking of the treatment (fig S4).

Network plot of studies included in network meta-analysis on clinical fractures. Each circle represents an intervention and is referred to as a node. Nodes are sized proportionally to the number of trials that included each intervention. Lines between nodes represent direct comparisons, and their thickness is proportional to the number of trials contributing to each comparison. Number of trials for each direct comparison is shown. No connecting line between two treatments indicates no direct comparison

Figure 5 is a forest plot illustrating the results of node splitting, comparing the direct, indirect, and network estimates. For our network meta-analysis, we found no indication of inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence (fig 5), and we considered that the relevant effect modifiers were balanced across the different comparisons. Figure S3 reports the potential baseline risk indicators facilitating the judgments about the assumption of transitivity.

### Update on estrogens and the skeleton [^112oucML]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Context

The very clinical trial, the Women's Health Initiative, which definitely established the antifracture efficacy of estrogen therapy, led to the demise of estrogen treatment as a viable, long-term option for prevention of bone loss in postmenopausal women due to the well-publicized adverse effects of estrogen plus progestin therapy on a number of nonskeletal endpoints. Given the diminishing clinical use of estrogen, it is logical to question whether estrogen regulation of bone remains a relevant issue at a clinical or basic research level.

Evidence Acquisition

Findings of this update are based on a PubMed search and the author's knowledge of the field.

Evidence Synthesis

Basic and clinical studies on the mechanisms of estrogen effects on bone will continue to provide potential novel drug targets for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. At a clinical level, it is clear that even the low levels of estrogen present in postmenopausal women have a significant impact on bone turnover, leading to a more aggressive approach to prevent bone loss in patients with breast cancer on aromatase inhibitors. Conversely, increasing these low estrogen levels with small doses of estrogen may have beneficial skeletal effects in postmenopausal women without adverse effects on reproductive tissues. Finally, the search continues for new selective estrogen receptor modulators with beneficial effects on bone and other tissues.

Conclusions

Even in the post-WHI era, basic and clinical investigation on estrogen and bone will continue to yield important insights that not only expand our knowledge at a basic level but also impact the health of our aging population.

### Postmenopausal hormone use and skeletal fracture: does the size of the benefit decrease with increasing age? [^111j4kzS]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Results of a recent meta-analysis of randomized trials suggest that, among postmenopausal women, the relative impact of hormone use in reducing the incidence of skeletal fracture declines with increasing age. We contend that: 1) the duration of the randomized trials in which older postmenopausal women were included was too short to adequately evaluate the impact of long-term hormone use on fracture risk; 2) randomized trials of hormone use in relation to a surrogate end point, bone mineral density, as well as nonrandomized studies of hormones and fracture risk, have documented a skeletal benefit associated with long-term hormone use among postmenopausal women irrespective of age; and 3) even if with increasing age there were a true decline in the relative benefit associated with the use of hormones, the size of the absolute reduction in fracture risk produced by hormone use among older postmenopausal women could be similar to or greater than that among younger postmenopausal women. For these reasons, we believe that when weighing the risks and benefits of the initiation or continuation of hormone therapy, a postmenopausal woman and her provider of health care need not consider her age when estimating the skeletal benefit such therapy can offer.

### Is it time to revisit the recommendations for initiation of menopausal hormone therapy? [^113Vxb4F]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Findings from the Women's Health Initiative studies led to menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) guidelines generally recommending the initiation of MHT be limited to women within 10 years of their menopause or before the age of 60 years. This recommendation has led to women who experience troublesome menopausal symptoms and who have not commenced MHT within these limits often being denied this type of therapy. Similarly, the majority of women who might benefit from the protective effects of MHT against bone loss and fracture are not offered this treatment option if they do not fit with these criteria. Based on review of the evidence that led to the conditional initiation of MHT, and subsequent studies, we propose that the recommendations regarding the initiation of MHT need to change to be more inclusive of women outside these chronological limits.

### Strategies for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis during early postmenopause [^115enRQy]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

During the perimenopause, both the quantity and quality of bone decline rapidly, resulting in a dramatic increase in the risk of fracture in postmenopausal women. Although many factors are known to be associated with osteoporotic fractures, measures to identify and treat women at risk are underused in clinical practice. Consequently, osteoporosis is frequently not detected until a fracture occurs. Identification of postmenopausal women at high risk of fracture therefore is a priority and is especially important for women in early postmenopause who can benefit from early intervention to maintain or to increase bone mass and, thus, reduce the risk of fracture. Most authorities recommend risk-factor assessment for all postmenopausal women, followed by bone mineral density measurements for women at highest risk (ie, all women aged ≥ 65 years, postmenopausal women aged < 65 years with ≥ 1 additional risk factors for osteoporosis, and postmenopausal women with fragility fractures). All postmenopausal women can benefit from nonpharmacologic interventions to reduce the risk of fracture, including a balanced diet with adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, regular exercise, measures to prevent falls or to minimize their impact, smoking cessation, and moderation of alcohol intake. Several pharmacologic agents, including the bisphosphonates (eg, alendronate, risedronate, and ibandronate) and the selective estrogen receptor modulator, raloxifene, have been shown to increase bone mass, to reduce fracture risk, and to have acceptable side-effect profiles. Women who have discontinued hormone therapy are in particular need of monitoring for fracture risk, in light of the accelerated bone loss and increased risk of fracture that occurs after withdrawal of estrogen treatment.

### Menopause hormone therapy: 30 years of advances and controversies [^114ix3BR]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Menopause Hormone Therapy (MHT) recommendations have changed significantly over the last thirty years. Early observational studies suggested that MHT offered broad benefits for women, including relief from menopausal symptoms, improved genitourinary health, prevention of osteoporosis, and reduction in cardiovascular disease. As randomized controlled trials were conducted to validate these findings, new evidence emerged that led to shifts in guidance from medical societies and sharp declines in MHT prescriptions. This review summarizes three decades of studies, key advancements and ongoing controversies. We also discuss recommendations for MHT from cardiology, obstetrics/ gynecology and endocrinology perspectives.

Calcium and vitamin D — fracture outcomes evidence summarizes that calcium vs placebo "showed no significant effect on reduction in the risk of vertebral or hip fractures, but a 37% reduction in the risk of nonvertebral fractures (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.90)", vitamin D vs placebo "showed no significant effect… but a 56% reduction in the risk of nonvertebral fractures (HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.88)", and the combination "showed no significant effect on reduction in the risk of vertebral fractures, but a 19% reduction in the risk of hip fractures (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.93), and a 5% reduction in the risk of nonvertebral fractures (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.90 to 1.00)". The greatest observed benefit was "the greatest risk reduction (33%)… in elderly individuals living in residential care", and in the Women's Health Initiative, combined calcium, vitamin D, and HT "had a 42% reduction in hip fractures (0.37 to 0.93) vs calcium plus vitamin D alone".

Regarding medical management for postmenopausal osteoporosis, more specifically with respect to menopausal hormone therapy, ES 2020 guidelines recommend to consider initiating menopausal hormone therapy, with estrogen-only therapy after hysterectomy, to prevent all types of fractures in postmenopausal patients with osteoporosis at high risk of fractures if meeting the following criteria:

- < 60 years of age or < 10 years after menopause

- low risk of DVT

- bisphosphonates and denosumab are not appropriate

- bothersome vasomotor symptoms

- additional climacteric symptoms

- no contraindications

- no prior myocardial infarction or stroke

- no breast cancer

- willing to take menopausal hormone therapy.

### Hormone replacement therapy and fractures in older adults [^115K5Kdv]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2001). Low credibility.

Estrogen deficiency in women is associated with accelerated bone loss, and estrogen replacement therapy has been proven to be effective in preventing osteoporosis and fractures in postmenopausal women. The introduction of selective estrogen receptor modulators that have an estrogen-like effect on the skeleton but have a different pattern of effects on other tissues may have an important role in the management of osteoporosis in women in the near future. In men, androgen deficiency has been shown to be associated with osteoporosis. Although androgen replacement in hypogonadal men may decrease bone resorption and increase bone mass, long-term placebo-controlled trials are needed to better define the benefits and risks of such therapy before it can be recommended. Sex hormone deficiency is linked to the development of osteoporosis in both women and men. In women, hormonal replacement by estrogen or the newly developed selective estrogen receptor modulators may prevent the development of osteoporosis and its related fractures. In men, there is early evidence that testosterone replacement therapy may enhance bone mass in hypogonadal men.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^113CmpaW]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy — key points: The safety profile of hormone therapy is most favorable when initiated in healthy women aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset, so initiation of hormone therapy by menopausal women aged older than 60 years requires careful consideration of individual benefits and risks. [Level I] Long-term use of hormone therapy, including for women aged older than 60 years, may be considered in healthy women at low risk of CVD and breast cancer with persistent VMS or at elevated risk of fracture for whom other therapies are not appropriate. (Level III) Factors that should be considered include severity of symptoms, effectiveness of alternative nonhormone interventions, and underlying risk for osteoporosis, CHD, cerebrovascular accident, VTE, and breast cancer. (Level III) Hormone therapy does not need to be routinely discontinued in women aged older than 60 or 65 years. (Level III)

### The 2012 hormone therapy position statement of: the North American Menopause Society [^114YryjJ]. Menopause (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

This position statement aimed to update the evidence-based position statement published by The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in 2010 regarding recommendations for hormone therapy (HT) for postmenopausal women. This updated position statement further distinguishes the emerging differences in the therapeutic benefit-risk ratio between estrogen therapy (ET) and combined estrogen-progestogen therapy (EPT) at various ages and time intervals since menopause onset.

Methods

An Advisory Panel of expert clinicians and researchers in the field of women's health was enlisted to review the 2010 NAMS position statement, evaluate new evidence, and reach consensus on recommendations. The Panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees as an official NAMS position statement.

Results

Current evidence supports the use of HT for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women when the balance of potential benefits and risks is favorable for the individual woman. This position statement reviews the effects of ET and EPT on many aspects of women's health and recognizes the greater safety profile associated with ET.

Conclusions

Recent data support the initiation of HT around the time of menopause to treat menopause-related symptoms and to prevent osteoporosis in women at high risk of fracture. The more favorable benefit-risk ratio for ET allows more flexibility in extending the duration of use compared with EPT, where the earlier appearance of increased breast cancer risk precludes a recommendation for use beyond 3 to 5 years.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^113WtG2E]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Osteoporosis — During the WHI intervention phase in women of all ages, the CEE plus MPA group had six fewer hip fractures per 10,000 women and six fewer vertebral fractures per 10,000 when compared with the placebo group, and the CEE-alone group had six fewer hip fractures per 10,000 women and six fewer vertebral fractures per 10,000 women compared with the placebo group; however, in the subset of women aged 50 to 59 years at treatment initiation, neither CEE plus MPA nor CEE alone was associated with decreased risk of hip fracture. After hormone therapy discontinuation in the WHI hormone therapy trials, there was a return of fracture risk to levels seen in women who had received placebo, with no excess fracture risk observed after discontinuation, and there are no prospective fracture studies directly comparing hormone therapy with other approved pharmacologic therapies for fracture prevention.

Research needs and gaps — more research is needed on whether age or timing of initiation of hormone therapy with respect to menopause affects health outcomes; on whether the benefits and harms of menopausal hormone therapy vary across population groups, including understanding whether therapy might have a different magnitude or balance of harms or benefits across racial and ethnic groups and how an individual patient data meta-analysis might inform this; and on the comparative benefits and harms of different formulations and treatment durations of menopausal hormone therapy.

1 and about one third will experience dyspareunia, vaginal dryness, or decreased libido. Conventional treatment for menopausal vasomotor symptoms usually consists of hormone replacement therapy. Prevention of osteoporosis usually consists of HRT, bisphosphonates, selective estrogen receptor modifiers, calcitonin, exercise, or calcium and vitamin D supplements. Cardiovascular disease prevention traditionally includes smoking cessation, lowering of lipid levels, blood pressure control, weight control, diabetes management, and exercise. The role of Hrt in this area is still unclear. The women in the black cohosh group had a statistically significant improvement in menopausal vasomotor symptoms and vaginal epithelium after 12 weeks. This group also had significantly greater symptom relief than the placebo and estrogen groups. However, contrary to a vast number of earlier studies, this one found that the estrogen group fared no better than the placebo group.

Preventing Cardiovascular Disease Roughly one half of postmenopausal women die of coronary heart disease or stroke, making CHD the leading cause of death in women in this category. Though HRT was once believed to reduce cardiac events, new evidence appears to contradict these earlier observational studies. 34, 35 Some discussion of alternative methods to reduce risk in this population is warranted. Of course, traditional risk-reduction measures should also be employed. It is theorized that these effects are the result of the membrane-stabilizing effect of these oils. Though these results are impressive in women with established CHD, no large trials have yet addressed the use of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids as a means of primary prevention in post-menopausal women who are at risk.

Preventing Bone Loss It is well documented that the rate of bone loss increases significantly after menopause. Alternative therapies, such as soy and magnesium, may be of benefit. 45 66 post-menopausal women consumed 40 g of soy protein per day during a six-month trial. The study noted an increase in lumbar spine bone mineral density of 2. 2 percent during the study period. No bone density differences were noted in the hip. 45 So far, there have been no studies documenting the role of soy in preventing fractures or increasing hip bone mineral density.

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^111ppnhG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — objective and core management principles: The objective is to formulate clinical practice guidelines for the pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Conclusions note a consensus for four management principles, including that the risk of future fractures should be determined using country-specific assessment tools, patient preferences should be incorporated into treatment planning, nutritional and lifestyle interventions and fall prevention should accompany all pharmacologic regimens to reduce fracture risk, and multiple pharmacologic therapies are capable of reducing fracture rates in postmenopausal women at risk with acceptable risk-benefit and safety profiles.

### Recency and duration of postmenopausal hormone therapy: effects on bone mineral density and fracture risk in the national osteoporosis risk assessment (NORA) study [^113sgY9Y]. Menopause (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

Results from the Women's Health Initiative showed that postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) prevents fractures but has an overall unfavorable risk:benefit ratio, leading to the recommendation that HRT be used only for women with troublesome menopause symptoms, and for as short a time as possible. This recommendation has important implications for the timing and duration of HRT and the prevention of osteoporosis. The large number of women participating in the National Osteoporosis Risk Assessment (NORA) program provided the opportunity to evaluate bone mineral density (BMD) and 1-year fracture risk in analyses stratified by duration and recency of HRT.

Design

Participants were 170,852 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 104, without known osteoporosis, who were recruited from primary physicians offices across the US. BMD was measured at one of four peripheral sites, and the 1-year risk of osteoporotic fracture was assessed by questionnaire.

Results

At baseline, current HRT users had the highest T-scores at every age. Among current hormone users, women who had used HRT longest had the highest BMD levels. Women who had stopped HRT more than 5 years previously, regardless of duration of use, had T-scores similar to never-users. Current but not past hormone use at baseline was associated with a 25% to 29% lower risk of osteoporotic fracture (P < 0.0001) in 1 year, compared with nonusers. These findings were independent of age, ethnicity, body mass index, lifestyle, years postmenopausal, and site of BMD measurement.

Conclusions

We conclude that postmenopausal BMD and fracture are closely associated with current, but not prior, HRT use. Use of HRT for 5 years or less, as proposed for treatment of symptomatic women during menopause transition, is unlikely to preserve bone or significantly reduce fracture risk in later years.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^115G8fey]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

NAMS position statement — conclusions on effectiveness and benefit-risk stratification state that hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for VMS and GSM and has been shown to prevent bone loss and fracture, and that risks differ by type, dose, route, timing, and progestogen need; treatment should be individualized using the best available evidence to maximize benefits and minimize risks, with periodic reevaluation. Absolute attributable risks for hormone therapy in the 50- to 59-year-old age group or within 10 years of menopause onset are low, whereas risks appear greater when initiated at 60 years and older or further than 10 years from menopause onset, particularly for those aged 70 years and older or more than 20 years from menopause onset. For women aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset and without contraindications, the benefit-risk ratio appears favorable for treatment of bothersome VMS and for the prevention of bone loss and reduction of fracture, and based on the WHI RCTs, longer duration may be more favorable for ET than for EPT. For women who initiate hormone therapy more than 10 or 20 years from menopause onset or when aged 60 years or older, the benefit-risk ratio appears less favorable than for younger women because of greater absolute risks of CHD, stroke, VTE, and dementia.

### Estrogen and progestogen use in postmenopausal women: 2010 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^116zFqH3]. Menopause (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To update for both clinicians and the lay public the evidence-based position statement published by The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in July 2008 regarding its recommendations for menopausal hormone therapy (HT) for postmenopausal women, with consideration for the therapeutic benefit-risk ratio at various times through menopause and beyond.

Methods

An Advisory Panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of women's health was enlisted to review the July 2008 NAMS position statement, evaluate new evidence through an evidence-based analysis, and reach consensus on recommendations. The Panel' s recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees as an official NAMS position statement. Also participating in the review process were other interested organizations who then endorsed the document.

Results

Current evidence supports a consensus regarding the role of HT in postmenopausal women, when potential therapeutic benefits and risks around the time of menopause are considered. This paper lists all these areas along with explanatory comments. Areas that vary from the 2008 position statement are noted. A suggested reading list of key references published since the last statement is also provided.

Conclusions

Recent data support the initiation of HT around the time of menopause to treat menopause-related symptoms; to treat or reduce the risk of certain disorders, such as osteoporosis or fractures in select postmenopausal women; or both. The benefit-risk ratio for menopausal HT is favorable for women who initiate HT close to menopause but decreases in older women and with time since menopause in previously untreated women.

### Preventing osteoporosis in symptomatic postmenopausal women [^116z73Nw]. Menopause (2011). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is a common postmenopausal disease that has a substantial impact on the quality of life of older women and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. There are various options for preventing osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, and all are associated with differing benefit-risk profiles. Estrogen therapy (in hysterectomized women) and estrogen/progestogen therapy (in nonhysterectomized women) are the most effective treatments available for the relief of vasomotor and urogenital symptoms in postmenopausal women and provide significant protection against osteoporotic fractures. Selective estrogen receptor modulators reduce bone loss and prevent vertebral fractures without endometrial or breast stimulation. Raloxifene, the only selective estrogen receptor modulator approved for osteoporosis prevention and treatment, significantly reduces vertebral but not nonvertebral or hip fractures. Bisphosphonates prevent bone loss and vertebral fractures; however, not all bisphosphonates have been shown to prevent nonvertebral fractures. Selective estrogen receptor modulators and bisphosphonates are not effective for menopausal symptoms. Hormone therapy should be considered as first-line therapy for preventing bone loss and fractures in early postmenopausal women who are symptomatic; other options include selective estrogen receptor modulators and bisphosphonates, especially in older, nonsymptomatic women. Future therapies are likely to include newer selective estrogen receptor modulators, combinations of estrogen with selective estrogen receptor modulators, and denosumab.

### Management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: the 2021 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^113k3ftY]. Menopause (2021). High credibility.

North American Menopause Society (NAMS) position statement — pharmacologic therapy indications and follow-up: Drug therapy is recommended to prevent bone loss in postmenopausal women with premature menopause, at least until the average age of natural menopause; low BMD (T-score < −1.0) and experiencing relatively rapid bone loss because of acute estrogen deficiency in the menopause transition or on discontinuing ET; or low BMD (T-score < −1.0) and other risk factors for fracture but who do not meet the criteria for osteoporosis treatment. Drug therapy is recommended to treat osteoporosis in these populations: all postmenopausal women who have had a vertebral or hip fracture; all postmenopausal women who have BMD values consistent with osteoporosis (ie, T-scores ≤ −2.5) at the LS, FN, or TH region; and all postmenopausal women who have T-scores from −1.0 to −2.5 and any one of history of fracture of proximal humerus, pelvis, or distal forearm. Consider osteoanabolic therapies for patients at very high risk of fracture, including older women with recent fractures, T-scores −3.0 and lower, or multiple other risk factors. Perform comprehensive evaluation, including vertebral imaging when indicated, before beginning osteoporosis therapy; during therapy, recheck the treatment goals and the choice of medication on an ongoing basis through periodic medical examination and follow-up BMD testing; once diagnosed, patients with osteoporosis require lifelong management to prevent fractures.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — estrogen with progestin and fracture effects: When estrogen is prescribed for a patient with an intact uterus, a progestin should also be used, either daily or cyclically, to protect against endometrial stimulation. In the WHI, conjugated equine estrogen (0.625 mg daily), with or without medroxyprogesterone acetate, was shown to reduce the risk of fractures of the spine, hip, and nonvertebral sites in postmenopausal women. Current recommendations are to use estrogen for the relief of menopausal symptoms in the lowest dose necessary and for the shortest time possible.

### Management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: the 2021 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^117JcT9i]. Menopause (2021). High credibility.

Prevention versus treatment approvals and treatment effects — drugs are approved by North American regulatory agencies for either preventing or treating osteoporosis or both, and although North American guidelines since 2008 have focused on reducing fracture risk and do not recognize preventing osteoporosis by halting postmenopausal bone loss, various oral and transdermal estrogen preparations (alone or with progestogens or bazedoxifene [BZA]), raloxifene, tibolone (in Mexico only), and four bisphosphonates (alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate, zoledronate) have government approval for prevention of osteoporosis; bone density benefits persist while therapy continues but abate when estrogen-like drugs are discontinued, markers of bone turnover return to pretreatment within a few months and BMD falls to pretreatment within 1 to 2 years after stopping therapy, an effect prevented by switching to a bisphosphonate; a strong clinical argument can be made for prevention particularly in women entering menopause with low bone mass because on average women lose about one T-score unit (10–12%) of bone mass across a normal menopause transition with significant and irreversible deterioration in trabecular architecture that is preventable with estrogen and bisphosphonates; additional support comes from women with AIs for nonmetastatic breast cancer in whom bisphosphonates and denosumab prevented bone loss and denosumab reduced vertebral fractures by 50% within the first year of treatment, including in women with normal BMD at baseline.

### Low-dose estrogen therapy for prevention of osteoporosis: working our way back to monotherapy [^113wuS7C]. Menopause (2006). Low credibility.

The risks of low bone mineral density, osteoporosis and fractures, are major concerns in postmenopausal women. Although postmenopausal hormone therapy is effective for reducing these risks, safety issues have been raised by the results of studies such as the Women's Health Initiative. Although there are scientifically valid reasons to be wary of the general applicability of the Women's Health Initiative findings, the study has underscored the continuing need for research into new forms of menopausal hormone therapy. Low-dose transdermal estrogen monotherapy can preserve bone density while relieving vasomotor symptoms. Transdermal administration may offer advantages, including lack of first-pass liver metabolism, which permits the use of lower doses and avoids a negative impact on the lipid profile. Moreover, a recently published 2-year study of ultra-low-dose transdermal estrogen monotherapy in an older population similar to that of the WHI reported significant increases in bone mineral density, accompanied by significant reductions in markers of bone turnover, with no increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia or other side effects. Additional studies are warranted to shed further light on the possible benefits of low-dose estrogen monotherapy for the prevention of bone loss in postmenopausal women.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^1117fa78]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Osteoporosis — In the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), estrogen-progestogen therapy (EPT; 0.625 mg conjugated equine estrogens [CEE] plus 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate [MPA]) significantly increased lumbar spine and total hip bone mineral density by 4.5% and 3.7%, respectively, relative to placebo and reduced fracture risk; markers of bone turnover return within a few months and bone mineral density fell to pretreatment levels within 1 to 2 years of stopping therapy. For postmenopausal women with established osteoporosis, hormone therapy does not carry an FDA indication for treatment, and in women who have osteoporosis, hormone therapy has not been demonstrated in randomized controlled trials to decrease fracture risk.

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^113gaxsD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Hormone therapy (HT) and tibolone — efficacy, harms, and candidate selection in postmenopausal osteoporosis are detailed as follows. Estrogen therapy reduces fractures (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.89), including a 29% reduction in hip fractures (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.98) and a 21% reduction in nonvertebral fractures (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.90). Tibolone shows a 44% reduction in vertebral fractures (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.74) and a 27% reduction in nonvertebral fractures (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.92), but side effects limit use, including stroke (HR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.14 to 4.23), vaginal discharge, and bleeding; benefits include lower risks of breast cancer (HR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.80) and colon cancer (HR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.96), and patients taking tibolone have fewer falls. The risk of venous thromboembolic disease may be lower with transdermal rather than oral estrogen, and there was increased recurrence of breast cancer with tibolone in women with previous breast cancer in LIBERATE. For candidate selection, there is a recommendation to select women < 60 years of age or within 10 years of menopause, and if menopausal HT is prescribed for osteoporosis and it is stopped, alternative treatments for osteoporosis should be given.

### Management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: the 2021 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^111JTxDy]. Menopause (2021). High credibility.

North American Menopause Society (NAMS) 2021 position statement — Osteoporosis in older postmenopausal women increases fracture risk with significant morbidity and mortality, with postmenopausal bone loss related to estrogen deficiency as the primary contributor; other risk factors include advanced age, genetics, smoking, thinness, and many diseases and drugs that impair bone health. Evaluation of these risk factors to identify candidates for osteoporosis screening and recommending nonpharmacologic measures such as good nutrition (especially adequate intake of protein, calcium, and vitamin D), regular physical activity, and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption are appropriate for all postmenopausal women. For women at high risk, especially perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with low bone density and other risk factors, estrogen or other therapies are available to prevent bone loss, and for women with osteoporosis and/or other risk factors for fracture, the primary goal of therapy is to prevent new fractures, accomplished by nonpharmacologic measures, drugs to increase bone density or improve bone strength, and strategies to reduce fall risk. If pharmacologic therapy is indicated, government-approved options include estrogen agonists/antagonists, bisphosphonates, RANK ligand inhibitors, parathyroid hormone-receptor agonists, and inhibitors of sclerostin; management of skeletal health involves assessing risk factors for fracture, reducing modifiable risk factors through dietary and lifestyle changes, and using pharmacologic therapy for patients at significant risk, with lifelong management that is individualized and should include the patient in the process of shared decision-making.

Objective

To update for both clinicians and the lay public the evidence-based position statement published by The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in March 2007 regarding its recommendations for menopausal hormone therapy (HT) for postmenopausal women, with consideration for the therapeutic benefit-risk ratio at various times through menopause and beyond.

Design

An Advisory Panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of women's health was enlisted to review the March 2007 NAMS position statement, evaluate new evidence through an evidence-based analysis, and reach consensus on recommendations. The Panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees as an official NAMS position statement. The document was provided to other interested organizations to seek their endorsement.

Results

Current evidence supports a consensus regarding the role of HT in postmenopausal women, when potential therapeutic benefits and risks around the time of menopause are considered. This paper lists all these areas along with explanatory comments. Conclusions that vary from the 2007 position statement are highlighted. Addenda include a discussion of risk concepts, a new component not included in the 2007 paper, and a recommended list of areas for future HT research.

Benefits of MHT and current guidelines

MHT is effective in reducing vasomotor and genitourinary symptoms associated with menopause, promoting bone health, and, in many cases, improving quality of life. A Cochrane review including 24 randomized controlled trials studying MHT administration for vasomotor symptoms demonstrated a reduction in weekly hot flashes by 75% and an 87% decrease in severity of hot flashes, demonstrating it to be an effective therapy for this difficult-to-manage symptom of menopause, which on its own is associated with increased risk of CVD. MHT is currently approved by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of vasomotor and genitourinary symptoms, prevention of osteoporosis, and as estrogen replacement in the setting of surgical menopause, hypogonadism, or premature ovarian insufficiency. Options for MHT include conjugated equine or synthetic estrogens, micronized 17β-estradiol, or ethinyl estradiol. Progestogens are indicated for endometrial protection in patients with a uterus, and include MPA, norethindrone acetate, and progesterone. Additionally, bazedoxifene, a SERM, can be combined with CE to form a tissue-selective estrogen complex, providing endometrial protection without the use of a progestogen.

### Management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: the 2021 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^113QBvrw]. Menopause (2021). High credibility.

Key points for prevention therapy selection in early postmenopause emphasize timing, preferred options, and when to use alternates: Intervening to prevent rapid bone loss and deterioration of skeletal structure is a unique opportunity to maintain bone health, and such intervention would be most appropriate in women with low BMD who are experiencing relatively rapid bone loss because of acute estrogen deficiency in the perimenopausal and early postmenopausal periods or on discontinuing ET. For younger, healthy postmenopausal women, particularly those with VMS, who are candidates for prevention of bone loss, estrogen alone (if no uterus) or combined with progestogen or BZA are the most appropriate therapies. A bisphosphonate should be initiated only if estrogen is contraindicated or on stopping ET. Raloxifene is an option for prevention of bone loss in postmenopausal women with an elevated risk of breast cancer and a high intolerance of VMS. Bisphosphonates to prevent bone loss can be considered in postmenopausal women with low BMD (T-score < −1) and other risk factors for fracture (eg, family history) who do not meet criteria for osteoporosis treatment.

This statement summarizes the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations for use of hormone replacement therapy for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women and updates the 1996 USPSTF recommendations on this topic. The complete information on which this statement is based, including evidence tables and references, is available through the USPSTF Web site (http://www.preventiveservices.ahrq.gov) and through the National Guideline Clearinghouse (http://www.guideline.gov) The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the use of postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy and the following outcomes: cardiovascular disease, including CHD and stroke; osteoporosis and fractures; thromboembolism; dementia and cognitive function; breast, colon, ovarian, and endometrial cancer; and cholecystitis. The USPSTF also reviewed evidence of the effects of hormone replacement therapy on phytoestrogens and osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. The use of hormone replacement therapy for relieving active symptoms of menopause, such as hot flashes, urogenital symptoms, and mood and sleep disturbances, among others, is outside the scope of these USPSTF recommendations, and literature on this topic was not reviewed. Sources for estimates of benefits and harms cited in this Recommendation statement are described in the summary of the evidence available from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

### Raloxifene reduces fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis [^11397zVn]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2006). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Recently, selective estrogen receptor modulators have been developed for the management of osteoporosis based on antiosteoclastic properties similar to that of estrogens but with a safety profile including potential benefits on the breast, heart, and cognitive function. Raloxifene, the first selective estrogen receptor modulator to be marketed for the treatment of osteoporosis has shown reduction in spinal fracture risk in patients with low bone mineral density with (48%) or without (35%) prevalent vertebral fracture. Raloxifene also reduces nonvertebral fractures in high risk patients (47%). The decrease in Type I procollagen N-terminal propeptide at 1 year accounts for 28% of the total reduction in vertebral fracture risk. Raloxifene reduced the risk of estrogen receptor-positive invasive breast cancer by 84%. Among subjects with increased cardiovascular risk at baseline, those assigned to raloxifene had a 40% decrease in the risk of cardiovascular events compared with placebo. The definite anti-fracture efficacy of raloxifene at the spine, its plausible effect on non-spine fracture in high-risk patients and its beneficial effect on breast and heart make this compound an interesting approach for women presenting with osteoporosis.

### Discontinuation of hormone therapy and bone mineral density: does physical activity modify that relationship? [^1176iS1X]. Menopause (2023). Medium credibility.

Menopause is defined as the cessation of menstrual cycles due to decline of follicular ovarian function and results in the onset of various expected physiological changes, including decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) due to declining ovarian estrogen production. Estrogen is a naturally occurring physiological hormone that helps to control osteoclast activity. After menopause, BMD loss can occur because of drops in endogenous estrogen production, resulting is greater bone resorption by osteoclastic cells and reduction in new bone formation. As a result, postmenopausal women are at greater risk for experiencing significant drops in BMD and increasing their risk for the development of osteoporosis and bone fracture.

Menopausal hormone therapy (HT) use in postmenopausal women can reduce bone loss. However, HT use in postmenopausal women has been met with hesitancy since the results of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) estrogen plus progestin trial in 2002. The trial showed higher risk than benefit in older women taking HT. The risks included heart disease, stroke, and breast cancer. Hip and total fracture reductions, and bone density increases, were shown to be the major benefit of estrogen plus progestin. However, discontinuation of HT use can result in bone loss similar to that which occurs at the time of menopause. BMD returns to pre-HT treatment levels after HT discontinuation.

There is some evidence that certain types of sustained physical activity (PA) in women can provide benefit to BMD. Weight-bearing exercise and resistance training early in life have the greatest positive impact on improvements in BMD. However, after menopause, PA can still help maintain BMD at specific bone sites, including the femoral neck, lumbar spine, and trochanter. The relationship between PA and BMD in postmenopausal women over age 65 as explored by Pinheiro et al in their 2020 systematic review concluded that physical activity that is diverse in exercise types, specifically resistance training, plays a role in osteoporosis prevention. The data indicated that the bone response may vary by body region and higher dose exercise programs are more effective. In addition findings from Gonzalo-Encabo et al in 400 postmenopausal women participating in a 12-month exercise intervention suggested that postmenopausal women could prevent some BMD loss with greater volumes of aerobic exercise, specifically those involving weight-bearing components. Overall, this study suggested a dose-response effect for greater maintenance of BMD with higher PA levels.

While acknowledging that hormone therapy is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the prevention of osteoporosis and reduces fractures, the USPSTF notes that evidence reviewed showed decreased fracture risk but, given the overall benefits and harms, it concluded that there is no net benefit at the population level.

### Recent concerns surrounding HRT [^112PKmfE]. Clinical Endocrinology (2003). Low credibility.

Millions of women are treated with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for relief of menopausal symptoms, including vasomotor flushes and sweats for which oestrogen is uniquely and highly effective. Others may continue longer-term treatment in the hope that HRT will help to prevent chronic disease. The preservation of bone mass with continuing oestrogen therapy and reduction of subsequent risk of fracture is well established. Observational studies of the metabolic and vascular effects of oestrogens have suggested a potential benefit in reducing the risk of vascular disease, but recently published randomized controlled trials demonstrate no evidence of benefit in women with established vascular disease or in apparently healthy women. The increased risks of breast cancer and thromboembolic disease have been confirmed in these trials, with evidence of increased risk of stroke. Observational data suggest there may be a small increased risk of ovarian cancer associated with longer-term use of HRT. The premature termination of one arm of the Women's Health Initiative randomized controlled trial caused concern among patients, doctors and pharmaceutical companies. There are difficulties in extrapolating the results from trials using a specific HRT product to advise women on the wide range of other hormone products, doses, combinations and routes of administration. However, in the absence of evidence that other products are safer, the data suggest that for many women the risks associated with long-term use of HRT outweigh the benefits. There are nonhormonal strategies for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. HRT is not, and has never been, licensed in the UK for the prevention or treatment of vascular disease, and the data suggesting potential benefit should now be regarded as biased. The absolute incidence of an adverse event is low, and the risk in an individual woman in a single year is very small, but the risks are cumulative over time with long-term use. The risk-benefit balance of each woman needs regular reappraisal with continued use.

### Pharmacologic prevention of osteoporotic fractures [^114gpCzJ]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mineral density and a deterioration in the microarchitecture of bone that increases its susceptibility to fracture. The World Health Organization defines osteoporosis as a bone mineral density that is 2.5 standard deviations or more below the reference mean for healthy, young white women. The prevalence of osteoporosis in black women is one half that in white and Hispanic women. In white women 50 years and older, the risk of osteoporotic fracture is nearly 40 percent over their remaining lifetime. Of the drugs that have been approved for the prevention or treatment of osteoporosis, the bisphosphonates (risedronate and alendronate) are most effective in reducing the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures. Risedronate has been shown to reduce fracture risk within one year in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and in patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. Hormone therapy reduces fracture risk, but the benefits may not outweigh the reported risks. Teriparatide, a recombinant human parathyroid hormone, reduces the risk of new fractures and is indicated for use in patients with severe osteoporosis. Raloxifene has been shown to lower the incidence of vertebral fractures in women with osteoporosis. Salmon calcitonin is reserved for use in patients who cannot tolerate bisphosphonates or hormone therapy.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — communicating risk to patients: Risk communication has been defined as "the study and practice of collectively and effectively understanding risks", and in health-care interactions it is characterized as "one-to-one communication in which the intervention includes a stimulus to patients to weigh the risks and benefits of a treatment choice or behavioral (risk reducing) change". It is incumbent on the clinician to provide this information to each patient in a manner that is fully understood and to learn from patient beliefs and concerns. Estimation of fracture risk should consider that T-score must be combined with clinical risk factors, especially advanced age and previous fracture, and that absolute fracture risk is more useful than T- score in developing treatment plans.

### Bisphosphonates and HRT for postmenopausal… [^114stGPa]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Hormone replacement therapy is currently accepted as treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis, with a 50 percent reduction in fractures, especially of the hip, related to this condition. Bisphosphonates are also known to increase bone mass. Wimalawansa conducted this randomized controlled trial to determine if there was a synergistic effect on bone mineral density when hormone replacement therapy and etidronate, a bisphosphonate, were used together in women with established postmenopausal osteoporosis. Patients were excluded from the study if they had surgically-induced menopause or secondary osteoporosis, or if they had previously used medications that affect calcium metabolism. All 72 patients were encouraged to engage in mild exercise and to make lifestyle modifications as needed. All patients received 1 g of elemental calcium and 400 units of vitamin D daily. Three treatment groups and a control group were included in the study. The hormone replacement therapy group received 0.

625 mg of premarin and 150 mg of norgestrel daily for 12 days each month; the etidronate group received 400 mg of etidronate daily for 14 days every 12 weeks; and the combined therapy group received hormone replacement therapy and etidronate in the above dosages. To determine bone mineral density, patients had radiograph absorptiometric measurements of the spine and hip at baseline and at two and four years after beginning treatment. Lateral radiographs of the spine were also taken at baseline and at four years, to determine the occurrence of new vertebral fractures. Patients in the control group lost 0. 9 percent of spinal bone mineral density at two years and
2. 5 percent at four years. Patients in the hormone replacement therapy group and the etidronate group experienced no significant increases in spinal bone mineral density. In contrast, the combined therapy group showed a significant increase in spinal bone mineral density at year two and year four.

Similarly, the patients in the combined treatment group had significant increases in hip bone mineral density at four years over the control and treatment groups. The combined treatment group also had a much lower fracture rate when compared with the control group. The author concludes that the combination of hormone replacement therapy plus etidronate can increase spinal and hip bone mineral density and prevent vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with known osteoporosis. A long-term study is necessary to assess the impact on fracture rates.

### Discontinuation of menopausal hormone therapy and risk of fracture: nested case-control studies using routinely collected primary care data [^117MbwPX]. The Lancet: Healthy Longevity (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Bone mineral density decreases with age and can decrease more rapidly in women during the period of menopause. Among ageing populations, rising levels of osteoporosis and fractures have become major health-care, societal, and economic concerns. Menopausal hormone therapy is a preferred treatment for menopause symptoms, and the beneficial effects on bone density and fracture risk while patients receive this therapy are well known. Some studies have investigated bone health or fracture outcomes after menopausal hormone therapy has ceased, but existing findings are inconsistent, with a lack of long-term evidence.

Research in context

A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of menopausal hormone therapy (dominated by the Women's Health Initiative, which followed-up women for up to 5 years after treatment) reported fracture risk decreases for current users but an unchanged risk post-discontinuation. The Million Women Study, a large observational study that investigated fracture risks during and after menopausal hormone therapy, similarly reported decreased fracture risks in current users but found no reportable change post-cessation. However, a US study of menopausal hormone therapy users reported a 55% rise in hip fracture risk after discontinuation, compared with current use. A National Osteoporosis Risk Assessment study found that bone density was higher in longer-term menopausal hormone therapy users and, although bone density decreased post-discontinuation, remained high compared with never-users. However, the number of fracture events was insufficient to demonstrate risk differences for different combinations of duration and recency of menopausal hormone therapy use. All studies had power limitations during follow-up. Other evidence on fracture risks after stopping menopausal hormone therapy is also inconsistent, underpowered, or based only on short-term menopausal hormone therapy use, despite about 40% of UK therapy users having a more than 5-year exposure.

We aimed to investigate the relationship between the risk of any fracture in users of menopausal hormone therapy and recency and duration of past use, focusing on the period after stopping menopausal hormone therapy and into the medium-term and long-term future.

Pharmacologic therapy to prevent bone loss — several drugs with differing mechanisms have demonstrated the ability to prevent bone loss in postmenopausal women and to reduce fracture risk in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis; antiremodeling agents include estrogen, estrogen agonists/antagonists (EAAs), bisphosphonates, and denosumab, which inhibit bone resorption and to a lesser extent bone formation, maintain or improve BMD and reduce fracture risk but do not improve or repair disruption of trabecular structure; in contrast, osteoanabolic agents stimulate new bone formation, improve cortical and/or trabecular bone structure, induce large increases in BMD, and reduce fractures more quickly than antiremodeling drugs.

### FDA requests labeling changes related to safety information to… [^112zfSUa]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

MHTs are used to provide relief from common menopause symptoms, such as hot flashes and night sweats) and symptoms due to changes to the vagina, vulva, and urinary tract caused by decreased estrogen, also known as vulvovaginal atrophy, or now more commonly known as genitourinary syndrome of menopause. Some MHTs are also approved to prevent osteoporosis. The proposed labeling changes follow the agency's comprehensive assessment of relevant literature since the publication of two long-term, large-scaled studies under the Women's Health Initiative, updated drug utilization review, and public input about MHTs. The two WHI studies investigated the role of estrogen plus progestin in women with a uterus or estrogen alone in women without a uterus in preventing heart disease, cancer, and bone fractures in postmenopausal women 50 to 79 years.

Most recently, FDA held an Expert Panel on July 17, 2025, and the panel focused on the risks and benefits of MHT. After the Expert Panel meeting, FDA requested broad public input on the risks and benefits related to menopause hormone therapy. Although menopause is a natural process in a woman's reproductive life, menopausal symptoms can significantly and adversely impact women's quality of life. FDA has approved numerous MHTs to treat moderate/severe hot flashes, VVA, and for some, prevention of bone thinning. In 2020, the U. S. Census Bureau data reported approximately 41 million women in the U. S. were aged 45 to 64 years, the ages when VMS is most common. FDA recognizes the primary aim of the WHI trials was to evaluate the impact of hormone therapy on cardiovascular disease and other chronic medical conditions in post-menopausal women across all ages, with the average participant aged 63 years.

In contrast, women typically experience bothersome VMS much earlier in the menopausal transition time. Regarding the probable dementia risk, the WHI studies enrolled women aged 65 to 79 years, a population much older than women starting MHT. Based on the agency's assessment of available data and recognition that menopause symptoms can significantly impact a woman's quality of life, FDA has re-considered the benefit/risk balance of these drugs and is requesting the following key changes to the prescribing information of MHT products:

### Fracture risk reduction and safety by osteoporosis treatment compared with placebo or active comparator in postmenopausal women: systematic review, network meta-analysis, and meta-regression analysis of randomised clinical trials [^112H3udn]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Advances in research have led to a more accurate assessment of the risk of fractures, and the range of treatment options available to prevent fractures has expanded. Algorithms on the risk of fractures that combine clinical risk factors and bone mineral density are now widely used in clinical practice to target treatment to individuals at high risk of fractures. Although drug treatments targeted at osteoporosis consistently improve bone mineral density, preventing fractures is the most relevant patient outcome. Heterogeneity has been noted for the magnitude of the reduction in the risk of vertebral, non-vertebral, hip, and clinical fractures between treatments. Few active comparator trials have directly compared the effects on fracture endpoints. Greater understanding of the differences in the effects of treatments across clinical trials would influence estimates of the benefits of treatment and should therefore be considered among the evidence base that drives guideline recommendations.

Moreover, most randomised controlled trials included patients with an estimated high baseline risk of fractures, but this varied between treatments and over time. Existing post hoc analyses indicate that the antifracture efficacy of some treatments for osteoporosis differ according to estimates of the baseline risk of fractures of individuals in the study, typically, but not exclusively, calculated with the fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX). Therefore, factors such as history of fractures, age, bone mineral density, and body mass index, among others, might be potential effect modifiers.

In this analysis, we looked at several baseline risk indicators associated with the efficacy of drug treatments to assess the evidence of the effect and harms of available osteoporosis treatments on primary and secondary reduction of the risk of fractures among postmenopausal women. We also critically appraised the internal validity of the randomised controlled trials. We used meta-regression analyses to explore the evidence of the effect of antiosteoporosis drug treatments on the risk of fracture according to recognised baseline risk factors.

### Management of menopause: a view towards prevention [^116moZ1N]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Women spend approximately one-third of their lives with menopause, which occurs around 50 years of age. It is now appreciated that several important metabolic and cardiovascular disease risks emerge during the menopausal transition. Many important conditions occur 10–15 years after menopause, including weight gain and obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, osteoporosis, arthritis, cardiovascular disease, dementia, and cancer; therefore, the occurrence of menopause heralds an important opportunity to institute preventative strategies. These strategies will lead to improved quality of life and decreased mortality. Various strategies are presented for treating symptoms of menopause and diseases that are asymptomatic. Among several strategies is the use of hormone therapy, which has efficacy for symptoms and osteoporosis, and can improve metabolic and cardiovascular health. When instituted early, which is key, in younger postmenopausal women (under 60 years) oestrogen has been found to consistently decrease mortality with a favourable risk-benefit profile in low-risk women. Prospective data show that long-term therapy might not be required for this benefit.

### Meta-analyses of therapies for postmenopausal osteoporosis. V. meta-analysis of the efficacy of hormone replacement therapy in treating and preventing osteoporosis in postmenopausal women [^114sQnxr]. Endocrine Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on bone density and fractures in postmenopausal women.

Data Source

We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE from 1966 to 1999, the Cochrane Controlled Register, citations of relevant articles, and proceedings of international meetings for eligible randomized controlled trials. We contacted osteoporosis investigators to identify additional studies, and primary authors for unpublished data.

Study Selection

We included 57 studies that randomized postmenopausal women to HRT or a control (placebo or calcium/vitamin D) and were of at least 1 yr in duration. Seven of these studies reported fractures.

Data Abstraction

For each study, three independent reviewers assessed the methodological quality and abstracted the data.

Data Synthesis

HRT showed a trend toward reduced incidence of vertebral fractures [relative risk (RR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41–1.07; 5 trials] and nonvertebral fractures (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.71–1.08; 6 trials). HRT had a consistent effect on bone mineral density (BMD) at all sites. The difference between HRT and control in the percent change in bone density at 2 yr was 6.76 (5.83, 7.89; 21 trials) at the lumbar spine and 4.53 (3.68, 5.36; 14 trials) and 4.12 (3.45, 4.80; 9 trials) at the forearm and femoral neck, respectively.

Conclusions

HRT has a consistent, favorable and large effect on bone density at all sites. The data show a nonsignificant trend toward a reduced incidence in vertebral and nonvertebral fractures.

Nonpharmacologic treatments and lifestyle modifications — postmenopausal osteoporosis emphasize encouraging all postmenopausal women to adopt lifestyle measures such as a balanced diet with adequate calcium and vitamin D, physical activity, and avoiding smoking to support general and bone health; however, these approaches will not prevent bone loss in early menopause, will not significantly increase BMD in postmenopausal women, and are not adequate treatment for osteoporosis. For women at high risk of fracture, pharmacologic therapy to strengthen the skeleton is required to reduce fracture risk.

### Management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: the 2021 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^117HZMei]. Menopause (2021). High credibility.

Systemic hormone therapy — indications, timing, and cautions for bone health: The primary indication for systemic HT is for relief of vasomotor (VMS) and other menopause symptoms in postmenopausal women aged younger than 60 years and within 10 years of menopause, with secondary benefit on bone protection. Extended use of HT is an option for well-counseled women who have a low bone mass for prevention of further bone loss and/or reduction of fracture risk when alternate therapies are not appropriate or when the benefits of extended use exceed the risks. Despite positive effects on bone, initiating HT in women aged older than 60 years or more than 10 years beyond menopause is generally not recommended because of concerns about cardiovascular safety, and ET or EPT should largely be used in the early years after menopause. For women with primary ovarian insufficiency, premature menopause, or early surgical menopause, an estrogen preparation should be considered, unless there are contraindications, to prevent bone loss as well as treat menopause symptoms, at least until the average age of natural menopause; higher doses of HT may be needed in younger women, particularly those aged younger than 40 years.

### Treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis [^116jwotZ]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

The aim of treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis is to reduce the frequency of vertebral and non-vertebral fractures (especially at the hip), which are responsible for morbidity associated with the disease. Results of large placebo controlled trials have shown that alendronate, raloxifene, risedronate, the 1–34 fragment of parathyroid hormone, and nasal calcitonin, greatly reduce the risk of vertebral fractures. Furthermore, a large reduction of non-vertebral fractures has been shown for alendronate, risedronate, and the 1–34 fragment of parathyroid hormone. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation is not sufficient to treat individuals with osteoporosis but is useful, especially in elderly women in care homes. Hormone replacement therapy remains a valuable option for the prevention of osteoporosis in early postmenopausal women. Choice of treatment depends on age, the presence or absence of prevalent fractures, especially at the spine, and the degree of bone mineral density measured at the spine and hip. Non-pharmacological interventions include adequate calcium intake and diet, selected exercise programmes, reduction of other risk factors for osteoporotic fractures, and reduction of the risk of falls in elderly individuals.

### Postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy: scientific review [^111BBH5m]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Context

Although postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is widely used in the United States, new evidence about its benefits and harms requires reconsideration of its use for the primary prevention of chronic conditions.

Objective

To assess the benefits and harms of HRT for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, thromboembolism, osteoporosis, cancer, dementia, and cholecystitis by reviewing the literature, conducting meta-analyses, and calculating outcome rates.

Data Sources

All relevant English-language studies were identified in MEDLINE (1966–2001), HealthSTAR (1975–2001), Cochrane Library databases, and reference lists of key articles. Recent results of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and the Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS) are included for reported outcomes.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

We used all published studies of HRT if they contained a comparison group of HRT nonusers and reported data relating to HRT use and clinical outcomes of interest. Studies were excluded if the population was selected according to prior events or presence of conditions associated with higher risks for targeted outcomes.

Data Synthesis

Meta-analyses of observational studies indicated summary relative risks (RRs) for coronary heart disease (CHD) incidence and mortality that were significantly reduced among current HRT users only, although risk for incidence was not reduced when only studies that controlled for socioeconomic status were included. The WHI reported increased CHD events (hazard ratio [HR], 1.29; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02–1.63). Stroke incidence but not mortality was significantly increased among HRT users in the meta-analysis and the WHI. The meta-analysis indicated that risk was significantly elevated for thromboembolic stroke (RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.01–1.40) but not subarachnoid or intracerebral stroke. Risk of venous thromboembolism among current HRT users was increased overall (RR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.64–2.81) and was highest during the first year of use (RR, 3.49; 95% CI, 2.33–5.59) according to a meta-analysis of 12 studies. Protection against osteoporotic fractures is supported by a meta-analysis of 22 estrogen trials, cohort studies, results of the WHI, and trials with bone density outcomes. Current estrogen users have an increased risk of breast cancer that increases with duration of use. Endometrial cancer incidence, but not mortality, is increased with unopposed estrogen use but not with estrogen with progestin. A meta-analysis of 18 observational studies showed a 20% reduction in colon cancer incidence among women who had ever used HRT (RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.74–0.86), a finding supported by the WHI. Women symptomatic from menopause had improvement in certain aspects of cognition. Current studies of estrogen and dementia are not definitive. In a cohort study, current HRT users had an age-adjusted RR for cholecystitis of 1.8 (95% CI, 1.6–2.0), increasing to 2.5 (95% CI, 2.0–2.9) after 5 years of use.

Conclusions

Benefits of HRT include prevention of osteoporotic fractures and colorectal cancer, while prevention of dementia is uncertain. Harms include CHD, stroke, thromboembolic events, breast cancer with 5 or more years of use, and cholecystitis.

Discontinuing hormone therapy — bone outcomes: After stopping systemic estrogen therapy (ET) or estrogen-progestogen therapy (EPT), bone mineral density (BMD) loss of 3% to 6% occurs during the first year and markers of bone turnover return to pretreatment values within a few months; within 2 years, BMD falls to levels seen in women who never took estrogen. In the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), discontinuation of HT was associated with a return of fracture risk to levels seen in women who had received placebo, with no excess fracture risk observed.

### Perspectives on the women's health initiative trial of hormone replacement therapy [^115DNKPz]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

The premature termination of one comparison in the Women's Health Initiative primary prevention trial due to stopping rules being reached necessitates a reconsideration of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). This part of the Women's Health Initiative trial, however, examined only one popular HRT regimen (conjugated equine estrogen [0.625 mg] and medroxyprogesterone acetate [2.5 mg] daily) in asymptomatic postmenopausal women. To help clinicians understand this large, complex trial, we describe several pervasive biases in earlier observational studies, review the principal findings of the trial, summarize recent systematic reviews, and offer clinical suggestions for HRT. Observational studies of HRT have found consistent, powerful protection against heart disease; this now appears due to consistent, powerful selection biases. These biases have the same net effect: Women using HRT in observational studies were healthier than those not using it. The Women's Health Initiative trial found that the overall risk-benefit ratio tipped against using HRT for prevention. Cardiovascular disease and breast cancer were increased among users, whereas colorectal cancer and osteoporotic fractures were reduced. Whether these findings relate to women with menopausal symptoms and to different HRT regimens is unknown. Hormone replacement therapy remains the best treatment for menopausal symptoms. Although estrogen has proven benefit for osteoporosis prevention, alternatives include raloxifene, alendronate, and risedronate. For women needing HRT, use of a low dose, with reassessments at least annually, appears prudent. Heart disease prevention strategies of proven value include exercise, weight control, blood pressure and lipid control, and avoidance of smoking. Hormone replacement therapy should not be used for this purpose.

### Effects of estrogen plus progestin on risk of fracture and bone mineral density: the women's health initiative randomized trial [^114Xtgjz]. JAMA (2003). Excellent credibility.

Context

In the Women's Health Initiative trial of estrogen-plus-progestin therapy, women assigned to active treatment had fewer fractures.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that the relative risk reduction of estrogen plus progestin on fractures differs according to risk factors for fractures.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized controlled trial (September 1993-July 2002) in which 16 608 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years with an intact uterus at baseline were recruited at 40 US clinical centers and followed up for an average of 5.6 years.

Intervention

Women were randomly assigned to receive conjugated equine estrogen, 0.625 mg/d, plus medroxyprogesterone acetate, 2.5 mg/d, in 1 tablet (n = 8506) or placebo (n = 8102).

Main Outcome Measures

All confirmed osteoporotic fracture events that occurred from enrollment to discontinuation of the trial (July 7, 2002); bone mineral density (BMD), measured in a subset of women (n = 1024) at baseline and years 1 and 3; and a global index, developed to summarize the balance of risks and benefits to test whether the risk-benefit profile differed across tertiles of fracture risk.

Results

Seven hundred thirty-three women (8.6%) in the estrogen-plus-progestin group and 896 women (11.1%) in the placebo group experienced a fracture (hazard ratio [HR], 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69–0.83). The effect did not differ in women stratified by age, body mass index, smoking status, history of falls, personal and family history of fracture, total calcium intake, past use of hormone therapy, BMD, or summary fracture risk score. Total hip BMD increased 3.7% after 3 years of treatment with estrogen plus progestin compared with 0.14% in the placebo group (P < .001). The HR for the global index was similar across tertiles of the fracture risk scale (lowest fracture risk tertile, HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.93–1.58; middle tertile, HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.04–1.46; highest tertile, HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.88–1.24) (P for interaction = .54).

Conclusions

This study demonstrates that estrogen plus progestin increases BMD and reduces the risk of fracture in healthy postmenopausal women. The decreased risk of fracture attributed to estrogen plus progestin appeared to be present in all subgroups of women examined. When considering the effects of hormone therapy on other important disease outcomes in a global model, there was no net benefit, even in women considered to be at high risk of fracture.

### A comparative review of the risks and benefits of hormone replacement therapy regimens [^112rh8Ne]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

The Women's Health Initiative (a large, randomized, placebo-controlled trial) investigated the effect of conjugated equine estrogens combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate on specific potential long-term benefits and risks. A review of the clinical studies that have investigated different types and regimens of estrogens combined with progestins was conducted to assess how applicable the results of the Women's Health Initiative are to hormone replacement therapy regimens in general. The studies that were reviewed were limited to randomized clinical trials and observational studies that have been published over the last 15 years (1987–2002) and to meta-analyses and reviews that may have included the literature before 1987. The increased risks for venous thromboembolism, stroke, coronary heart disease, and breast cancer that were identified in the Women's Health Initiative trial have also been reported with postmenopausal hormone therapies that contain a variety of estrogen and progestin products. The beneficial effects that were noted in the Women's Health Initiative, with respect to reductions in fractures and colorectal cancer, have not been evaluated in large, randomized controlled trials that use different estrogen/progestin combinations; however, observational trials that used a variety of estrogen or hormone replacement therapy products and randomized clinical studies that evaluated bone mineral density (an excellent predictor of fracture risk) with different estrogen/hormone replacement therapy regimens would suggest that results would be similar to those found in the Women's Health Initiative. Although the relief of menopausal symptoms, the primary reason women seek treatment, was not included in the overall benefit/risk analysis of the Women's Health Initiative, numerous trials suggest that all therapies are effective. Overall, these data indicate that the benefit/risk analysis that was reported in the Women's Health Initiative can be generalized to all postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy products.

### Management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: 2006 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^111JdZ7G]. Menopause (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the evidence-based position statement published by The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in 2002 regarding the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.

Design

NAMS followed the general principles established for evidence-based guidelines to create this updated document. A panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of metabolic bone diseases and/or women's health were enlisted to review the 2002 NAMS position statement, compile supporting statements, and reach consensus on recommendations. The panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees.

Results

Osteoporosis, whose prevalence is especially high among elderly postmenopausal women, increases the risk of fractures. Hip and spine fractures are associated with particularly high morbidity and mortality in this population. Given the health implications of osteoporotic fractures, the primary goal of osteoporosis therapy is to prevent fractures, which is accomplished by slowing or stopping bone loss, maintaining bone strength, and minimizing or eliminating factors that may contribute to fractures. The evaluation of postmenopausal women for osteoporosis risk requires a medical history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests. Major risk factors for postmenopausal osteoporosis (as defined by bone mineral density) include advanced age, genetics, lifestyle factors (such as low calcium and vitamin D intake, smoking), thinness, and menopause status. The most common risk factors for osteoporotic fracture are advanced age, low bone mineral density, and previous fracture as an adult. Management focuses first on nonpharmacologic measures, such as a balanced diet, adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, adequate exercise, smoking cessation, avoidance of excessive alcohol intake, and fall prevention. If pharmacologic therapy is indicated, government-approved options are bisphosphonates, a selective estrogen-receptor modulator, parathyroid hormone, estrogens, and calcitonin.

Conclusions

Management strategies for postmenopausal women involve identifying those at risk of low bone density and fracture, followed by instituting measures that focus on reducing modifiable risk factors through lifestyle changes and, if indicated, pharmacologic therapy.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^117D87TK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Guideline scope and shared decision-making for menopausal symptom therapy: This guideline covers the full spectrum of therapies for relief of the most common and bothersome menopausal symptoms, while the detailed management of early menopause transition, primary ovarian insufficiency, and prevention of osteoporosis and fracture are considered beyond the current scope. Choice of therapy is ideally based on available evidence regarding safety and efficacy and is generally a shared decision including both patient and provider, and the treatment selected should be tailored to the individual patient and will vary according to each woman's symptom severity, age, medical profile, personal preference, and estimated benefit/risk ratio. An accepted philosophy is that a fully informed patient should be empowered to make a decision that best balances individual QOL benefits against potential health risks.

### Comparing therapies for postmenopausal osteoporosis prevention and treatment [^115TpdDy]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature concerning the efficacy of calcium, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), bisphosphonates, selective estrogen receptor modulators, and calcitonin in the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

Data Sources

Articles were identified through searches of the MEDLINE (1966-July 2002), EMBASE (1980-July 2002), and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-July 2002) databases using the key words osteoporosis, postmenopausal, fracture, calcium, vitamin D, hormone replacement therapy, bisphosphonates, alendronate, risedronate, raloxifene, and calcitonin. Additional references were located through review of the bibliographies of the articles cited. Searches were not limited by time restriction, language, or human subject.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Experimental and observational studies of the use of calcium and antiresorptive therapies for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis were selected. Articles evaluating bone mineral density (BMD) or fracture efficacy were included in this review.

Data Synthesis

HRT, bisphosphonates, raloxifene, and calcitonin have demonstrated stabilization of and improvement in BMD. Randomized clinical trials have shown fracture risk reduction with bisphosphonates, raloxifene, HRT, calcium, and calcitonin. The largest risk reductions have been reported with use of bisphosphonates in several trials.

Conclusions

Several therapeutic options with well-documented improvements in BMD and reductions in fracture risk are available to women for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

### Bone metabolism and the perimenopause overview, risk factors, screening, and osteoporosis preventive measures [^113eZxr1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

In summary, FDA-approved therapies for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis are all antiresorptive agents. There are no approved therapies at this time that stimulate bone formation, although one such agent (PTH) is awaiting approval. Screening perimenopausal women at risk should identify osteopenic women early in the menopause before the accelerated bone loss of estrogen deficiency causes further irreversible erosion in bone density. The National Osteoporosis Foundation advocates initiating therapy to reduce fracture risk in postmenopausal women with T scores below -2 in the absence or factors and with T scores below -1.5 if other risk factors are present. Estrogen, alendronate, residronate, and raloxifene have all been shown to reduce the incidence of radiographic vertebral fractures in women at risk. Only alendronate and residronate have been shown in large randomized trials to reduce the incidence of nonvertebral fractures including hip fractures in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. These antiresorptive therapies provide benefits above and beyond those of calcium and vitamin D alone. There is insufficient published evidence from randomized controlled trials convincingly to support a role for soy products, androgens, calcitonin, or fluoride in prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis or reduction of fracture rates in women at risk.

### Does tibolone reduce the risk of fracture in older postmenopausal women with osteoporosis? [^113rbE62]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2009). Medium credibility.

This Practice Point commentary discusses a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial by Cummings et al. that investigated the effects of tibolone 1.25 mg per day in 4,534 postmenopausal women (mean age 68 years) with osteoporosis. Tibolone is a synthetic steroid with estrogenic, progestational and androgenic effects. It has been used as an alternative to estrogen to treat menopausal symptoms for 30 years. Cummings et al. found that tibolone reduced the incidence of vertebral fractures by 45%, nonvertebral fractures by 26%, breast cancer by 68% and colon cancer by 69%. The trial was discontinued 2 months before a median treatment time of 3 years because the major end point (reduction of fractures) was reached. In addition, tibolone increased the risk of stroke, although the absolute risk was small. Similarly to other compounds with estrogenic activity that increase the risk of stroke, such as estrogen and selective estrogen-receptor modulators, clinicians must weigh the risks and benefits of therapy for individual patients. This risk might be lower in women aged 50–60 years than in those aged > 60 years.

### Update on menopause hormone therapy; current indications and unanswered questions [^114pVtrs]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide clinicians involved in managing menopause with a summary of current evidence surrounding menopause hormone therapy (MHT).

Design

The authors evaluate and synthesize existing pooled evidence relating to MHT's clinical indications, efficacy, and safety and explore the limitations of existing data.

Patients

The review focuses on MHT-related outcomes in women with natural-timed menopause captured within observational studies, RCTs, and pooled data from pivotal meta-analyses and reviews.

Measurements

Available published data are scrutinized. Available evidence and notably lacking data from women not adequately represented in published MHT trials, such as those with socioeconomic adversity, significant comorbidities, and minority ethnic backgrounds, are highlighted and deliberated.

Results

The impact of MHT differs significantly between demographics. Current consensus recommendations for MHT emphasize the importance of tailoring type, route, dose, and duration of therapy to individual needs and risk/benefit ratio through shared decision-making. MHT impact can change over time. Current MHT data support its benefits for treating menopause symptoms and a potential window of opportunity in midlife to benefit skeletal health. Limitations of current evidence highlight menopause health inequalities and underscores the need for further research.

Conclusions

This review recommends tailored use of MHT for well-defined indications, recognizing its value for menopause symptom relief and skeletal benefits for many midlife women. MHT may be used as long as benefits outweigh risks, through shared decision-making. There is insufficient clinical evidence to support the long-term use of MHT in some contemporary cohorts of women accessing MHT in clinical practice.

### Current perspectives on benefits and risks of hormone replacement therapy [^1123uSfv]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Hormone replacement therapy with estrogen alone or with added progestin relieves menopausal symptoms and physical changes associated with depleted endogenous estrogen levels. Estrogen replacement has also demonstrated a clear benefit in the prevention of osteoporosis. Hormone replacement therapy with added progestin maintains spinal bone density, protects against postmenopausal hip fractures, and provides these benefits even when therapy is started after age 60. More recently, additional benefits have emerged. Current estrogen and hormone replacement therapy users have a 34% reduction in the risk of colorectal cancer and a 20% to 60% reduction in the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Until recently, the body of evidence indicated that hormone replacement therapy with estrogen only reduced cardiovascular disease risk by 40% to 50% in healthy patients; whether the findings of 3 ongoing trials will change this conclusion is pending availability of the final results. The many benefits of estrogen and hormone replacement therapy must be weighed against a slight increase in the risk of breast cancer diagnosis with use for 5 or more years, but which disappears following cessation of therapy. Overall, estrogen and hormone replacement therapy improves the quality of life and increases life expectancy for most menopausal women.

### Assessing benefits and harms of hormone replacement therapy: clinical applications [^113U5vbf]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

An estimated one third of postmenopausal women in the United States use hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to treat symptoms of menopause and prevent chronic conditions. In the context of this widespread use, evidence has been growing about the potential harms of HRT, particularly regarding long-term use. Physicians and patients are often confused about how to use results of studies in individual cases. This article applies the current state of evidence for the benefits and harms of HRT to management decisions in 4 clinical situations. Patient preferences, as well as evidence, are important for these decisions. Benefits and harms need to be readdressed periodically to apply newly published evidence and to reassess emerging risks, comorbidities, and needs of individuals.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — bone mineral density effects with hormone therapy: In the WHI randomized controlled trial, standard daily estrogen-progestin therapy (EPT) increased lumbar spine (LS) and total hip (TH) bone density by 4.5% and 3.7%, respectively, versus placebo, in women aged 50 to 79 years (N = 16,608). Across trials of 2 years' duration, the mean difference in bone mineral density (BMD) after EPT was 6.8% at the LS and 4.1% at the femoral neck (FN). Low-dose vaginal estradiol acetate (0.05 mg or 0.1 mg) increased hip BMD by 1.7% and 1.8%, respectively, and LS BMD by 2.7% and 3.3%, respectively, compared with baseline.

### Management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: the 2021 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^116TaHEX]. Menopause (2021). High credibility.

North American Menopause Society 2021 — osteoanabolic therapies — These bone-building drugs stimulate bone formation and restore trabecular structure; because effects diminish over time, therapy with anabolic agents is limited to treatment intervals of 12 to 24 months. Bone mineral density is lost rapidly when osteoanabolic agents are discontinued, so to maximize benefits these therapies should always be followed by an antiresorptive drug. Osteoanabolic therapies are more effective than antiresorptive agents at increasing BMD and reducing fractures and should be the initial therapy for osteoporosis in women at very high or imminent risk of fracture.

### Back to the future: hormone replacement therapy as part of a prevention strategy for women at the onset of menopause [^111EMTTx]. Atherosclerosis (2016). Low credibility.

In the late 1980s, several observational studies and meta-analyses suggested that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) was beneficial for prevention of osteoporosis, coronary heart disease, dementia and decreased all-cause mortality. In 1992, the American College of Physicians recommended HRT for prevention of coronary disease. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, several randomized trials in older women suggested coronary harm and that the risks, including breast cancer, outweighed any benefit. HRT stopped being prescribed at that time, even for women who had severe symptoms of menopause. Subsequently, reanalyzes of the randomized trial data, using age stratification, as well as newer studies, and meta-analyses have been consistent in showing that younger women, 50–59 years or within 10 years of menopause, have decreased coronary disease and all-cause mortality; and did not have the perceived risks including breast cancer. These newer findings are consistent with the older observational data. It has also been reported that many women who abruptly stopped HRT had more risks, including more osteoporotic fractures. The current data confirm a "timing" hypothesis for benefits and risks of HRT, showing that younger have many benefits and few risks, particularly if therapy is predominantly focused on the estrogen component. We discuss these findings and put into perspective the potential risks of treatment, and suggest that we may have come full circle regarding the use of HRT. In so doing we propose that HRT should be considered as part of a general prevention strategy for women at the onset of menopause.

### Fracture risk reduction and safety by osteoporosis treatment compared with placebo or active comparator in postmenopausal women: systematic review, network meta-analysis, and meta-regression analysis of randomised clinical trials [^114r8q1X]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and limitations of included studies

We used standardised methods allowing us to evaluate the certainty of the results. The potential risks of bias identified across several of the included studies, predominantly in the form of selective reporting, lowered the rate of certainty in the effect estimates of the outcomes. Other reporting items might have favoured newer studies because older studies would not always have anticipated a future standard. Reporting items that might have favoured newer studies were domains related to the description of randomisation sequence generation and allocation concealment (selection bias), but not the domains related to incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting (post hoc analyses), and potential active involvement of funding parties. We adhered to best practice and reviewed only the quality of published scientific papers. The supposedly poor quality of reporting in randomised controlled trials is not unique to drug trials of osteoporosis and is a common problem across medical disciplines. Efforts towards more transparent and stringent reporting are urgently needed.

### Fracture risk reduction and safety by osteoporosis treatment compared with placebo or active comparator in postmenopausal women: systematic review, network meta-analysis, and meta-regression analysis of randomised clinical trials [^117VVURz]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Certainty of evidence

The overall GRADE evaluation of the certainty in the effect estimates was moderate to low for all individual outcomes because of the serious risk of bias and imprecision (table 1 and secondary outcomes in table S6).

Table 1
Estimates of effects and quality ratings for comparison of drug treatments for osteoporosis to prevent clinical fractures

CI = confidence interval.

Baseline risk calculated from: †Miller 2016,‡Cosman 2016,§Greenspan 2003.

Downgraded because of serious risk of bias or imprecision.

The serious risk of bias was mainly because of unclear reporting of how random sequence and allocation concealment were performed (table S7). Some studies also had incomplete outcome dataand selective outcome reporting(table S7). Potential involvement of the funding parties was judged to increase the risk of bias related to conflict of interest. A serious risk of imprecision was assigned for outcomes where data were available from one study only. From visual inspection of the funnel plots, we did not detect evidence of small study effects (fig S1).

### Management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: the 2021 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^1149uAGN]. Menopause (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review evidence regarding osteoporosis screening, prevention, diagnosis, and management in the past decade and update the position statement published by The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in 2010 regarding the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women as new therapies and paradigms have become available.

Design

NAMS enlisted a panel of clinician experts in the field of metabolic bone diseases and/or women's health to review and update the 2010 NAMS position statement and recommendations on the basis of new evidence and clinical judgement. The panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees.

Results

Osteoporosis, especially prevalent in older postmenopausal women, increases the risk of fractures that can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Postmenopausal bone loss, related to estrogen deficiency, is the primary contributor to osteoporosis. Other important risk factors for postmenopausal osteoporosis include advanced age, genetics, smoking, thinness, and many diseases and drugs that impair bone health. An evaluation of these risk factors to identify candidates for osteoporosis screening and recommending nonpharmacologic measures such as good nutrition (especially adequate intake of protein, calcium, and vitamin D), regular physical activity, and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption are appropriate for all postmenopausal women. For women at high risk for osteoporosis, especially perimenopausal women with low bone density and other risk factors, estrogen or other therapies are available to prevent bone loss. For women with osteoporosis and/or other risk factors for fracture, including advanced age and previous fractures, the primary goal of therapy is to prevent new fractures. This is accomplished by combining nonpharmacologic measures, drugs to increase bone density and to improve bone strength, and strategies to reduce fall risk. If pharmacologic therapy is indicated, government-approved options include estrogen agonists/antagonists, bisphosphonates, RANK ligand inhibitors, parathyroid hormone-receptor agonists, and inhibitors of sclerostin.

Conclusions

Osteoporosis is a common disorder in postmenopausal women. Management of skeletal health in postmenopausal women involves assessing risk factors for fracture, reducing modifiable risk factors through dietary and lifestyle changes, and the use of pharmacologic therapy for patients at significant risk of osteoporosis or fracture. For women with osteoporosis, lifelong management is necessary. Treatment decisions occur continuously over the lifespan of a postmenopausal woman. Decisions must be individualized and should include the patient in the process of shared decision-making.

Objective

To update the evidence-based position statement published by The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in 2006 regarding the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.

Methods

NAMS followed the general principles established for evidence-based guidelines to create this updated document.

The panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees.

Results

Osteoporosis, which is especially prevalent among older postmenopausal women, increases the risk of fractures. Hip and spine fractures are associated with particularly high morbidity and mortality in this population. Given the health implications of osteoporotic fractures, the primary goal of osteoporosis therapy is to prevent fractures, which is accomplished by slowing or stopping bone loss, maintaining bone strength, and minimizing or eliminating factors that may contribute to fractures. The evaluation of postmenopausal women for osteoporosis risk requires a medical history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests. Major risk factors for postmenopausal osteoporosis (as defined by bone mineral density) include advanced age, genetics, lifestyle factors (such as low calcium and vitamin D intake, smoking), thinness, and menopause status. The most common risk factors for osteoporotic fracture are advanced age, low bone mineral density, and previous fracture as an adult. Management focuses first on nonpharmacologic measures, such as a balanced diet, adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, adequate exercise, smoking cessation, avoidance of excessive alcohol intake, and fall prevention. If pharmacologic therapy is indicated, government-approved options are bisphosphonates, selective estrogen-receptor modulators, parathyroid hormone, estrogens, and calcitonin.

Conclusions

Management strategies for postmenopausal women involve identifying those at risk for fracture, followed by instituting measures that focus on reducing modifiable risk factors through dietary and lifestyle changes and, if indicated, pharmacologic therapy.

### Hormone therapy for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal persons: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114cs6Gh]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Menopause is defined as the cessation of a person's menstrual cycle. It is defined retrospectively, 12 months after the final menstrual period. Perimenopause, or the menopausal transition, is the few-year time period preceding a person's final menstrual period and is characterized by increasing menstrual cycle length variability and periods of amenorrhea, and often symptoms such as vasomotor dysfunction. The prevalence and incidence of most chronic diseases (eg, cardiovascular disease, cancer, osteoporosis, and fracture) increase with age, and US persons who reach menopause are expected on average to live more than another 30 years.

Objective

To update its 2017 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the benefits and harms of systemic (ie, oral or transdermal) hormone therapy for the prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal persons and whether outcomes vary by age or by timing of intervention after menopause.

Population

Asymptomatic postmenopausal persons who are considering hormone therapy for the primary prevention of chronic medical conditions.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the use of combined estrogen and progestin for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal persons with an intact uterus has no net benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the use of estrogen alone for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal persons who have had a hysterectomy has no net benefit.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends against the use of combined estrogen and progestin for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal persons. (D recommendation) The USPSTF recommends against the use of estrogen alone for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal persons who have had a hysterectomy. (D recommendation).

### Prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis with pharmacological therapy: practice and possibilities [^113AFatP]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) is a common disease that will become more prevalent in the future, with costly implications for public health. Prevention of the disease and its consequences, namely fractures, is therefore, important for both the individual and society. This review discusses: the goals of PMO prevention; the identification of women at risk, including the use of bone mineral density and bone turnover markers; the relevance in the prevention setting of various current guidelines for PMO management; recent data on therapeutic options for the treatment and prevention of PMO, in particular bisphosphonates, hormone replacement therapy and several other new pharmacological agents. It concludes that it is crucial for PMO prevention to start before disease onset and that, in the light of recent evidence, the existing guidelines need updating if they are to continue to be relevant.

### Role of estrogens in the management of postmenopausal bone loss [^116eDBjj]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

It is well known that estrogen deficiency is the major determinant of bone loss in postmenopausal women. Estrogen is important to the bone remodeling process through direct and indirect actions on bone cells. The largest clinical experience exists with estrogen therapy, demonstrating its successful prevention of osteoporosis as well as its positive influence on oral bone health, vasomotor and urogenital symptoms, and cardiovascular risk factors, which may not occur with other nonestrogen-based treatments. Compliance with HRT, however, is typically poor because of the potential side effects and possible increased risk of breast or endometrial cancer. Nevertheless, there is now evidence that lower doses of estrogens in elderly women may prevent bone loss while minimizing the side effects seen with higher doses of estrogen. Additionally, when adequate calcium, vitamin D, and exercise are used in combination with estrogen-based treatments, more positive increases occur in bone density. The benefits and risks of HRT must be assessed on a case-by-case basis, and the decision to use HRT is a matter for each patient in consultation with her physician. Estrogen-based therapy remains the treatment of choice for the prevention of osteoporosis in most postmenopausal women, and there may be a role for estrogen to play in the prevention of corticosteroid osteoporosis. Combination therapies using estrogen should probably be reserved for patients who continue to fracture on single therapy or should be used in patients who present initially with severe osteoporosis.

### Bone health and aging: implications for menopause [^114qojzM]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is one major health condition that contributes to excess morbidity and mortality in women after menopause. In the past, hormone therapy (HT) was prescribed commonly for symptoms of menopause, and there was also evidence that HT protected against osteoporosis. Recently, however, the overall health risks have been reported to exceed benefits, with the beneficial effects seen only in the decreased incidence of hip fractures and colon cancer. The role of HT in menopausal women is unclear at this time, although many women may require it to reduce menopausal symptoms. Osteoporosis may be an area where the benefit of using HT may outweigh the risks in a select group of women. Further, because lower than usual doses of estrogen have been shown to reduce menopausal symptoms and to protect bone, additional research will likely expand physicians' current knowledge of the use of HT in menopausal women. This article reviews the use of low-dose estrogen to promote bone health in postmenopausal women.

### Effect of low-dose hormone replacement therapy on bone… [^111sMGQB]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis prevention through the use of hormone replacement therapy has been clearly documented. However, the dose-related side effects of HRT have limited its acceptance, and many times patients do not even fill their HRT prescriptions. In addition, the lowest available dosages of HRT have not been tested for efficacy in preventing bone loss, particularly in elderly women. Several studies have shown an inconsistent benefit in the prevention of bone loss with low-dose HRT. The lowest dosage that produces bone effects has been thought to be 0. 625 mg of conjugated equine estrogens per day or the equivalent. Recker and associates hypothesized that spinal bone loss would be prevented in elderly, postmenopausal women who received continuous therapy with 0. 3 mg per day of conjugated equine estrogen combined with
2. 5 mg per day of medroxyprogesterone, supplemented by adequate calcium and vitamin D intake.

Bone mineral density of the spine increased significantly in the HRT-treated group. This increase occurred most rapidly during the first six months of therapy and peaked at three years, with an overall increase of 4 percent. The value at the end of the study was 3. 23 percent. Radius bone mineral density also increased significantly in the HRT-treated group. Femoral neck bone density steadily increased in the HRT-treated group for the first one and one half years, then decreased somewhat by the end of the study. Overall, the treatment effect of bone mineral density did not reach statistical significance. Of the 128 study participants, 107 completed the study; all dropouts occurred during the first year. The dropout rate was similar in both study groups. Side effects thought to be related to HRT were mild and brief. In the HRT-treated group, the most common side effect included vaginal spotting or a change in the nature of vaginal discharge.

Most side effects from HRT disappeared within six months. The authors conclude that continuous oral therapy with 0. 3 mg per day of conjugated equine estrogen and
2. 5 mg per day of medroxyprogesterone combined with adequate calcium and vitamin D intake has a significant bone-sparing effect in elderly women. The increase in bone mineral density demonstrated with low-dose HRT is equal to that reported with higher dosages of HRT. Undesirable side effects were rare and brief. The risk of endometrial cancer is likely to be less with lower doses of estrogen, but this requires further investigation.
