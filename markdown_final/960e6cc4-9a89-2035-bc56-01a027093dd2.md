## Question

typical demographic of a patient with gerd

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the typical demographic of a patient with GERD. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "typical" in a way that aligns with epidemiology and clinical practice. Then, I should verify prevalence estimates and geographic variation. Next, I will examine age, sex, and race/ethnicity patterns, followed by risk factors like obesity and lifestyle. After that, I need to distinguish non-erosive reflux disease from erosive esophagitis and Barrett's esophagus because demographics differ by phenotype. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically useful profile and note exceptions and nuances that could change management or screening decisions.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't anchor on a misleading "typical". GERD is commonly defined by troublesome heartburn and/or regurgitation, with a global adult prevalence around 13–20% in high-income regions and substantial regional variation, which frames what "typical" means in population terms rather than implying a single archetype [^116289iV] [^1158WG2M] [^117DokST].

> I will now examine age patterns. Wait, let me verify whether GERD is predominantly a disease of older adults or if it spans ages. Prevalence rises with age but is common in adults of all ages, and while complications like Barrett's esophagus and adenocarcinoma concentrate in older individuals, symptomatic GERD itself is not limited to the elderly, so "typical" spans adulthood with risk accumulating over time [^1158WG2M] [^111Vukfr] [^117NRJo3].

> Next, I should review sex distribution. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — some studies suggest a female predominance in symptomatic GERD, yet men are overrepresented among those with erosive esophagitis and Barrett's esophagus, reflecting a disconnect between symptom reporting and mucosal disease severity. Thus, the "typical" patient with symptoms is more often female, whereas the "typical" patient with complications is more often male [^116289iV] [^117NRJo3] [^111Vukfr].

> I need to check race and ethnicity next. In the United States, GERD symptoms are common across racial groups, but erosive disease and Barrett's esophagus are substantially more frequent in non-Hispanic White individuals, whereas East Asian populations have markedly lower prevalence of erosive esophagitis and Barrett's, even when symptomatic GERD is present. This shapes both risk stratification and screening thresholds in practice [^111Vukfr] [^117NRJo3] [^115iupmA].

> Let me consider obesity and body habitus, because this materially shifts pretest probability. Abdominal obesity and higher BMI are consistently associated with increased GERD risk and severity, and weight loss yields dose-dependent improvements in symptoms and acid exposure. Central adiposity appears to carry risk beyond BMI alone, reinforcing the relevance of waist circumference in clinical assessment [^116289iV] [^1127bfNw] [^115kqG9G].

> I should confirm lifestyle and comorbidity contributors that modify risk. Tobacco smoking, NSAID use, and dietary patterns such as high-fat or spicy foods are associated with higher GERD prevalence, and psychological stress and anxiety correlate with symptom burden, though causality is complex. These factors are common in the general population and thus feature in many "typical" patients [^116289iV] [^112erSoF] [^112vYMSH].

> Now, I will distinguish phenotypes because demographics differ by disease expression. Non-erosive reflux disease is the most common phenotype globally and tends to include more women and younger patients with normal acid exposure but heightened symptom perception, whereas erosive esophagitis and Barrett's esophagus cluster in older, male, White patients with higher BMI and more objective reflux. This split is crucial when interpreting who is "typical" in primary care versus endoscopy cohorts [^1118SNyU] [^116DHm4d] [^117NRJo3].

> But wait, what if the patient has extraesophageal symptoms rather than classic heartburn. I should double-check that atypical presentations are not rare. Chronic cough, laryngopharyngeal symptoms, and asthma-like features are common in the community, and patients with extraesophageal symptoms are more likely to be older and male, with a higher burden of objective reflux in some series, which again shifts the demographic profile depending on the clinical context [^113ZxQtP].

> Let me synthesize a clinically useful "typical" profile, while acknowledging exceptions. In primary care settings, the most common patient is an adult of any age, more often female, with overweight or obesity, living in a Western country, reporting heartburn and/or regurgitation at least weekly, and often with lifestyle risk factors such as smoking, NSAID use, or dietary triggers. In contrast, in endoscopy or surgical cohorts, the "typical" patient is more often male, older than 50, White, with central adiposity and objective reflux or complications, which explains why screening and procedural paradigms target this higher-risk subgroup [^116289iV] [^111Vukfr] [^112BYF8i].

> Hold on, I should verify key caveats so I don't overgeneralize. Prevalence varies widely by region, with lower rates in East Asia and higher rates in Western countries and parts of the Middle East, and within-country differences by race and socioeconomic status exist. Additionally, many patients with Barrett's esophagus or even esophageal adenocarcinoma report minimal or no typical GERD symptoms, so absence of heartburn does not exclude serious disease in higher-risk demographics [^117DokST] [^117NRJo3] [^116w4nxB].

> Finally, I need to ensure the clinical implications are explicit. Because the "typical" symptomatic patient often has non-erosive disease and a good response to PPIs, empiric therapy is reasonable, whereas the "typical" high-risk patient with male sex, age over 50, White race, central obesity, or long-standing symptoms warrants lower thresholds for endoscopic evaluation and consideration of objective reflux testing, especially if alarm features or refractory symptoms are present [^116289iV] [^112BYF8i] [^1172ddqh].

The typical GERD patient is an **adult aged 30–60 years** [^notfound], more often female, with overweight/obesity [^116289iV] and a Western lifestyle [^113ZxQtP]. Symptoms are usually heartburn and regurgitation [^1158WG2M], often triggered by meals, supine position, or nocturnal reflux [^notfound]. Risk increases with age, central obesity, smoking, alcohol, and dietary factors (high-fat, spicy, caffeine, chocolate) [^116289iV] [^115kqG9G]. Prevalence is higher in Western countries (about 20–30%) [^1158WG2M] and lower in East Asia (about 2–8%) [^115iupmA]. Many patients have non-erosive reflux disease, and a subset develop erosive esophagitis or Barrett's esophagus, especially older men with chronic symptoms [^1118SNyU] [^111Vukfr].

---

## Age distribution

- **Peak prevalence**: 30–60 years [^notfound].
- **Pediatric GERD**: Common in infants; prevalence declines with age [^1131N8LW].
- **Elderly**: Higher risk of complications (e.g. Barrett's, adenocarcinoma) [^111Vukfr].

---

## Gender distribution

Women have a **slightly higher prevalence** of typical symptoms, whereas men are more likely to have erosive esophagitis and Barrett's esophagus [^117NRJo3].

---

## Geographic and ethnic distribution

Prevalence is **higher in Western countries** (North America, Europe, Australia) at 18–28% [^115gWatE] [^117NRJo3], and lower in East Asia at 2.5–7.8% [^115iupmA]. Ethnic variation shows higher risk in non-Hispanic whites for Barrett's and adenocarcinoma, whereas East Asians have lower risk [^117NRJo3].

---

## Socioeconomic and lifestyle factors

Obesity is a **major risk factor**, particularly central adiposity [^115kqG9G] [^1127bfNw]. Smoking and alcohol use increase risk and severity [^116289iV] [^116dk1tM]. Dietary factors such as high-fat, spicy foods, caffeine, and chocolate are common triggers [^115QoFPb]. Sedentary lifestyle and low socioeconomic status are also associated with higher prevalence [^116dk1tM] [^112dujDZ].

---

## Clinical presentation

Typical symptoms include heartburn, regurgitation, and chest discomfort [^1158WG2M]; **atypical symptoms** include cough, laryngitis, and dental erosion [^112dujDZ]. Non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) is the most common phenotype, while erosive esophagitis and Barrett's esophagus occur in a subset [^1118SNyU].

---

## Comorbidities and complications

Comorbidities include obesity, diabetes, and respiratory conditions (asthma, COPD) [^116289iV] [^115k5kwH]. Complications include erosive esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, and esophageal adenocarcinoma, with risk rising with chronicity and severity [^1158WG2M] [^116289iV].

GERD is a common and costly disorder. Despite its prevalence, the epidemiology and natural history of GERD are incompletely understood. Until now, most studies have been of short duration and utilized convenience samples of patients presenting for upper endoscopy. There remain several obstacles, enumerated above, that need to be overcome to better study the epidemiology of GERD. Large scale, prospective data collection with standardized terminology and longitudinal follow-up will allow a clearer picture of the incidence, prevalence, natural history, and complications of GERD. This in turn should lead to timely, cost-effective diagnosis and management of this disorder.

Background

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) refers to reflux of the gastric content into the esophagus, leading to esophagitis, reflux symptoms impairing the quality of life, or long-term complications.

GERD is one of the most common disorders seen by primary care providers and gastroenterologists in the United States as well as in Europe. Besides the millions of medical visits to physicians and the billions of dollars in annual costs, frequent or severe GERD symptoms are associated with time lost from work, impaired health-related quality of life, and esophageal adenocarcinoma, further emphasizing the clinical significance of this entity.

Although heartburn is highly specific to characterize GERD, patients usually report a number of associated symptoms such as regurgitation, nausea, sore throat, cough, eructation, globus, hiccups, chest pain, sleep disturbances, etc. Consequently, individuals with the typical GERD symptoms of heartburn and acid regurgitation constitute a heterogeneous group. The combinations of the different symptoms, their associations, but also their link with clinical or demographic factors (age, body mass index [BMI], history of GERD, comorbidities, etc.), might be more prominent in certain groups of patients. An improvement in the understanding of the structure underlying these individual differences in GERD symptoms would help to individualize subject profiles and to adapt GERD management.

### Advances in the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^113ZxQtP]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a multifaceted disorder encompassing a family of syndromes attributable to, or exacerbated by, gastroesophageal reflux that impart morbidity, mainly through troublesome symptoms. Major GERD phenotypes are non-erosive reflux disease, GERD hypersensitivity, low or high grade esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, reflux chest pain, laryngopharyngeal reflux, and regurgitation dominant reflux. GERD is common throughout the world, and its epidemiology is linked to the Western lifestyle, obesity, and the demise of Helicobacter pylori. Because of its prevalence and chronicity, GERD is a substantial economic burden measured in physician visits, diagnostics, cancer surveillance protocols, and therapeutics. An individual with typical symptoms has a fivefold risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma, but mortality from GERD is otherwise rare. The principles of management are to provide symptomatic relief and to minimize potential health risks through some combination of lifestyle modifications, diagnostic testing, pharmaceuticals (mainly to suppress or counteract gastric acid secretion), and surgery. However, it is usually a chronic recurring condition and management needs to be personalized to each case. While escalating proton pump inhibitor therapy may be pertinent to healing high grade esophagitis, its applicability to other GERD phenotypes wherein the modulating effects of anxiety, motility, hypersensitivity, and non-esophageal factors may dominate is highly questionable.

### Extraesophageal symptoms and diseases attributed to GERD: where is the pendulum swinging now? [^112SqJuS]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — Extraesophageal symptoms attributed to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) provides the following diagnostic guidance: Best Practice Advice 1: The role of a gastroenterologist in patients referred for evaluation of suspected extra esophageal symptom is to assess for gastroesophageal etiologies that could contribute to the presenting symptoms. Best Practice Advice 2: Non-GI evaluations by ENT, pulmonary and/or allergy are essential and often should be performed initially in most patients as the cause of the symptoms are more likely explained by these other entities than reflux. Best Practice Advice 3: Empiric therapy with aggressive acid suppression for 6–8 weeks with special focus on response of the extraesophageal symptoms can help in assessing association between reflux and extraesophageal symptoms. Best Practice Advice 4: No single testing methodology exists to definitively identify reflux as the etiology for the suspected extra esophageal symptoms. Best Practice Advice 5: Constellation of patient presentation, diagnostic test results and response to therapy should be employed in the determination of reflux as a possible etiology in extra esophageal symptoms. Best Practice Advice 6: Testing may need to be off or on proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy depending on patients' presenting demographics and symptoms in assessing the likelihood of abnormal gastroesophageal reflux. A. On therapy testing may be considered in those with high probability of baseline reflux. B. Off therapy testing may be considered in those with low probability of baseline reflux with the goal of identifying moderate to severe reflux at baseline.

### Presentation and epidemiology of gastroesophageal reflux Disease [^111Vukfr]. Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is the most prevalent gastrointestinal disorder in the United States, and leads to substantial morbidity, though associated mortality is rare. The prevalence of GERD symptoms appeared to increase until 1999. Risk factors for complications of GERD include advanced age, male sex, white race, abdominal obesity, and tobacco use. Most patients with GERD present with heartburn and effortless regurgitation. Coexistent dysphagia is considered an alarm symptom, prompting evaluation. There is substantial overlap between symptoms of GERD and those of eosinophilic esophagitis, functional dyspepsia, and gastroparesis, posing a challenge for patient management.

### Multi-society consensus conference and guideline on the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) [^113DgMFc]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). High credibility.

Multi-society consensus conference and guideline on the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) — systematic literature reviews addressed 4 key questions in adults on preoperative evaluation, endoscopic vs surgical or medical treatment, complete vs partial fundoplication, and management of obesity with concomitant GERD (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 35 kg/m²). Evidence-based recommendations were formulated using the GRADE methodology by subject experts. The consensus provided 13 recommendations and an algorithm was proposed for aid in the treatment of GERD. For diagnostic workup, patients with typical symptoms should undergo upper endoscopy, manometry, and pH testing; additional testing may be required for patients with atypical or extra-esophageal symptoms. For operative options, patients with normal or abnormal findings on manometry should consider undergoing partial fundoplication, and magnetic sphincter augmentation or fundoplication are appropriate surgical procedures for adults with GERD. For patients who wish to avoid surgery, the Stretta procedure and transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF 2.0) were found to have better outcomes than proton pump inhibitor medications alone.

### A socioeconomic perspective on the global burden of gastroesophageal reflux disease (1990–2021): findings from the GBD 2021 [^115QoFPb]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, this study provides empirical evidence from a socioeconomic perspective for GERD prevention and control. Future public health strategies should focus on stratified interventions. For policy-makers, GERD should be included in the national chronic disease prevention and control system to improve the priority given to the disease, which will help attract funds and attention and achieve comprehensive management. Public education campaigns on typical GERD symptoms (heartburn, reflux), risk factors (obesity, poor diet), and the importance of lifestyle interventions should be provided.

For clinicians, lifestyle intervention is the primary cornerstone. For all GERD patients, detailed guidance should be given on managing weight, not smoking, limiting alcohol, elevating the head of the bed, avoiding eating 3 h before bedtime, and reducing the intake of high-fat/spicy/acidic foods. Standardized and stepwise drug therapy should be implemented, and patient education and communication should be strengthened to promote compliance.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) epidemiology and burden — prevalence ranges from 18.1% to 27.8%, in Europe 8.8% to 25.9%, in the Middle East 8.7% to 33.1%, in East Asia 2.5% to 7.8%, and 11.6% to 23.0% in Australia. Due to its increasing prevalence, the widespread burden of disease carries both a financial and resource cost, and GERD also adversely impacts patients' quality of life (QoL).

### Gastroesophageal reflux disease: a review [^116289iV]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is defined by recurrent and troublesome heartburn and regurgitation or GERD-specific complications and affects approximately 20% of the adult population in high-income countries.

Observations

GERD can influence patients' health-related quality of life and is associated with an increased risk of esophagitis, esophageal strictures, Barrett esophagus, and esophageal adenocarcinoma. Obesity, tobacco smoking, and genetic predisposition increase the risk of developing GERD. Typical GERD symptoms are often sufficient to determine the diagnosis, but less common symptoms and signs, such as dysphagia and chronic cough, may occur. Patients with typical GERD symptoms can be medicated empirically with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Among patients who do not respond to such treatment or if the diagnosis is unclear, endoscopy, esophageal manometry, and esophageal pH monitoring are recommended. Patients with GERD symptoms combined with warning symptoms of malignancy (eg, dysphagia, weight loss, bleeding) and those with other main risk factors for esophageal adenocarcinoma, such as older age, male sex, and obesity, should undergo endoscopy. Lifestyle changes, medication, and surgery are the main treatment options for GERD. Weight loss and smoking cessation are often useful. Medication with a PPI is the most common treatment, and after initial full-dose therapy, which usually is omeprazole 20 mg once daily, the aim is to use the lowest effective dose. Observational studies have suggested several adverse effects after long-term PPI, but these findings need to be confirmed before influencing clinical decision making. Surgery with laparoscopic fundoplication is an invasive treatment alternative in select patients after thorough and objective assessments, particularly if they are young and healthy. Endoscopic and less invasive surgical techniques are emerging, which may reduce the use of long-term PPI and fundoplication, but the long-term safety and efficacy remain to be scientifically established.

Conclusions and Relevance

The clinical management of GERD influences the lives of many individuals and is responsible for substantial consumption of health care and societal resources. Treatments include lifestyle modification, PPI medication, and laparoscopic fundoplication. New endoscopic and less invasive surgical procedures are evolving. PPI use remains the dominant treatment, but long-term therapy requires follow-up and reevaluation for potential adverse effects.

### Epidemiology and pathophysiology of symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease [^112V62ne]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Symptomatic, or nonerosive, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is the most common presentation of GERD. Patients with symptomatic GERD more frequently are younger, female, weigh less, and are less likely to have a hiatal hernia compared with patients who have erosive GERD. Physiologically, these patients demonstrate minimal esophageal motor abnormalities. However, despite a common clinical presentation and similar endoscopic findings, symptomatic GERD is comprised of a heterogeneous group of patients. There are several identifiable subgroups differentiated by the underlying mechanisms causing their heartburn symptoms, distinctions that may explain the relatively low symptom response rate to potent antireflux treatment observed among these patients as compared with those with erosive esophagitis.

### The pathophysiologic basis for epidemiologic trends in gastroesophageal reflux disease [^113ZtLMV]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is defined by either subjective complaints indicative of problematic gastroesophageal reflux or objective complications directly attributable to reflux. Studies focused on GERD-related symptoms suggest a worldwide increase in prevalence of approximately 4% per year. Epidemiologic data indicate that possible contributing factors include increasing longevity, rising obesity rates, greater consumption of medications affecting esophageal function, and potentially changing prevalence rates of Helicobacter pylori infection. This article explores the interplay between pathophysiology and epidemiology by focusing on these risk factors and their potential effect on GERD pathogenesis.

### Patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma with prior gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms are similar to those without gastroesophageal reflux disease: a cross-sectional study [^116w4nxB]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A substantial proportion of patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) do not report gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms. This study aimed to compare the risk factor profiles and cancer stage at presentation of patients with EAC with and without prior GERD.

Methods

In this retrospective cross-sectional study, patients with EAC were divided into 2 cohorts: (i) EAC with prior GERD: patients who reported typical GERD symptoms (heartburn or regurgitation) ≥ 1 year before cancer diagnosis and (ii) EAC without prior GERD: patients who did not report prior GERD symptoms or reported symptoms within 1 year of their cancer diagnosis. Baseline demographics, risk factors, and cancer stage at presentation were compared between the 2 cohorts. In addition, the distribution of patients based on numbers of BE/EAC-associated risk factors (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 or more) was examined in the symptomatic and asymptomatic cohorts.

Results

Over 13 years, 388 patients with EAC with prior GERD and 245 patients with EAC without prior GERD were recruited. Both groups had similar baseline demographics and risk factors, but patients with EAC with prior GERD were more likely to have a history of BE. Asymptomatic patients had more advanced disease. Patients with 3 or more BE/EAC-related risk factors formed the largest proportion of patients in both the symptomatic and asymptomatic cohorts.

Discussion

Patients with EAC with and without prior GERD symptoms are phenotypically similar, suggesting that BE screening efforts to prevent or detect early EAC should not be restricted to just those with GERD.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) diagnostic workup — typical versus extra-esophageal symptoms: EGD, manometry, and pH testing are essential components of the diagnostic workup for patients with typical esophageal GERD symptoms, and manometry is used to rule out other motility disorders such as achalasia; for patients with atypical or extra-esophageal symptoms such as cough, throat clearing, chest pain, or hoarseness, additional workup including pH/impedance testing should be employed with possible referral to other specialty providers as determined by the physician.

### Pathophysiology of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^115WRwYN]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is one of the most common digestive diseases in the Western world, with typical symptoms, such as heartburn, regurgitation, or retrosternal pain, reported by 15% to 20% of the general population. The pathophysiology of GERD is multifactorial. Our understanding of these factors has significantly improved in recent years, with increased understanding of the acid pocket and hiatal hernia and how these factors interact. Although our insight has significantly increased over the past years, more studies are required to better understand symptom generation in GERD, especially in patients with therapy-resistant symptoms.

### AGA clinical practice update on the diagnosis and management of extraesophageal gastroesophageal reflux disease: expert review [^1146UHBo]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — Best Practice Advice 4 — consideration should be given toward diagnostic testing for reflux before initiation of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy in patients with potential extraesophageal manifestations of GERD, but without typical GERD symptoms. Initial single-dose PPI trial, titrating up to twice daily in those with typical GERD symptoms, is reasonable.

### Personalized approach in the work-up and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^116S9Mkq]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) present with heterogeneous symptoms, response to treatment, and physiologic profiles, requiring distinct and personalized management. This article provides a stepwise framework to phenotype GERD beginning with (1) characterization of symptom profile and response to acid suppression; (2) endoscopic evaluation of mucosal and anatomic integrity; (3) ambulatory reflux monitoring to characterize reflux burden and sensitivity; and (4) esophageal physiologic testing to assess gastroesophageal reflux mechanism and effectors of reflux clearance, and evaluate for alternate causes.

### Prevalence of GERD, its effect on HRQL and psychological… [^112erSoF]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

The global prevalence of GERD is about 13. 98% with variation among different countries and ethnic groups. In East Asia, it ranges from 2. 5% to
7. 5%, 8. 5 to
25. 9% in Europe, 18. 1% to
27. 8% in South and North America, and about 11. 6% in Australia. In the Middle East, it ranges from 8. 7% to
33. 1%. Several risk factors have been identified that increase the likelihood of having GERD. Obesity was found to be one of the risk factors that increases GERD. Also, dietary habits such as spicy food, coffee drinks, or administering NSAIDs increase the prevalence of having GERD. Rationale Medical students suffer from a study burden, which increases their level of anxiety and stress. They also have a higher likelihood of having trouble with eating behavior or having a lot of coffee daily. This increases their likelihood of having GERD. In the Middle East, fewer studies have assessed the effect of GERD.

A recent cross-sectional study assessed the prevalence of GERD among medical students in Egypt. They found a prevalence of 17. 1%. They found an association between increasing stress levels and increasing GERD severity. Also, smoking was a significant risk factor for GERD symptoms. Another cross-sectional study among medical students in 21 universities in Egypt. They reported a prevalence of 28. 4%. Again, they found that an increasing level of stress and anxiety was associated with increasing GERD severity. Finally, Two cross-sectional studies were conducted in Saudi Arabia. They reported a prevalence of 23. 8% and
23. 1% respectively. To our knowledge, no study has assessed the GERD and its related quality of life among medical students in Middle East and linked their findings with eating behaviour Other: Questionnaire
- ZU-IRB 1580/5-Aug-2025. If the participant scores 8 or more, this diagnosis is GERD. Furthermore, the severity can be assessed.

A score of 0–2 makes 0% of having GERD, 3–7 makes a 50% likelihood of having GERD, 8–10 makes a 79% and 11–18 makes a 89% of having GERD. This questionnaire has a sensitivity being 65% and a specificity being 71% to diagnose GERD|through study completion, an average of 6 months|.

### ACG clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^112ZgvjR]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) refractory symptoms — definitions and patient groups: persistent symptoms were reported in 32% of patients in randomized trials and 45% in observational studies. The most commonly accepted definition of refractory GERD is persistent heartburn and/or regurgitation despite 8 weeks of double-dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, whereas other authorities consider persistent symptoms after 12 weeks on double-dose PPIs to be refractory GERD. There are 2 broad groups with symptoms despite PPI therapy — those empirically treated with a PPI yet still symptomatic and those with objective evidence of GERD who have incomplete or no response to PPIs — and the evaluation of refractory GERD should begin with a careful history and physical examination.

### Gastroesophageal reflux disease [^1158WG2M]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on gastroesophageal reflux disease:

- **Definition**: GERD is a chronic condition in which the reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus causes symptoms such as heartburn and regurgitation or results in complications including esophagitis, stricture, or Barrett's esophagus. Diagnosis is based on typical symptoms, endoscopic findings of mucosal injury, or abnormal esophageal acid exposure on reflux testing.
- **Pathophysiology**: GERD results from dysfunction of the antireflux barrier at the GEJ, including transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations, hypotensive lower esophageal sphincter tone, and impaired diaphragmatic support. Additional factors such as delayed gastric emptying, reduced salivary neutralization, and impaired esophageal clearance contribute to prolonged acid exposure. Refluxed gastric acid and pepsin cause mucosal inflammation, cytokine release, and damage that may progress to erosive esophagitis or metaplasia.
- **Epidemiology**: The estimated prevalence of GERD symptoms in the US ranges from 6% to 30%, with a weekly prevalence of symptoms approaching 20%.
- **Disease course**: Typical manifestations include heartburn, regurgitation, and chest discomfort, with possible progression to dysphagia or bleeding in severe cases. Many patients experience intermittent symptoms that respond to lifestyle modification and PPIs, while a subset develops chronic or refractory disease requiring diagnostic evaluation and long-term therapy. Complications include erosive esophagitis, peptic stricture, and Barrett's esophagus.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of GERD is generally favorable with effective management. Most patients achieve symptom control with PPIs or lifestyle measures, though relapse is common when therapy is withdrawn. Severe erosive disease or Barrett's esophagus warrants indefinite acid suppression or surgical therapy. Barrett's esophagus occurs in about 10% of patients with chronic GERD. Long-term outcomes are excellent with adherence to treatment, and while complications can occur, GERD rarely progresses to life-threatening disease when managed appropriately.

### Factors that influence therapeutic outcomes in symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease [^113PGTcA]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

The term "symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease" (GERD) refers to those patients who present with the typical GERD symptoms of heartburn and regurgitation, yet do not have endoscopic evidence of esophagitis. The primary goals of managing symptomatic GERD are to control symptoms and improve quality of life. A clinical assessment of the GERD patient can identify important clinical features, such as atypical and extraesophageal symptoms for which acid-suppressive agents tend to be less effective. Performing an endoscopy can further identify the patient as having nonerosive reflux disease, erosive esophagitis, or Barrett's esophagus-diagnoses which can help determine treatment but may not prove predictive of therapeutic response. Determining acid exposure through pH testing can predict therapeutic response, with those revealing an abnormal acid exposure time being more responsive to acid-suppressive therapy. However, the performance of an endoscopy and pH testing on each patient is clearly not practical. Whereas the natural history of symptomatic GERD is still largely undefined, acid-suppressive therapy appears to be the best approach available for both the short-term and long-term management of this disease.

### Critical review of the epidemiology of gastroesophageal reflux disease with specific comparisons to asthma and breast cancer [^112WpHxp]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

GERD is one of the most common GI disorders. Despite its frequent occurrence, the absence of a consistent definition and an easily used diagnostic gold standard make it difficult to ascertain the true epidemiology of this condition. Recent work to validate a short symptom questionnaire to reliably diagnose GERD will be a major methodological improvement facilitating the analysis of large populations to better define its epidemiology. When these methods are available, a number of questions need to be addressed (Table 4). These include elucidating the epidemiology of erosive and nonerosive reflux disease, defining the epidemiology of GERD among minority populations, determining the natural history of erosive and nonerosive reflux disease, and identifying potential risk factors contributing to the development of GERD. The answers to these questions should improve our understanding of GERD, allowing us to better identify and treat individuals and populations at risk with the ultimate goal of improving quality of life in addition to preventing the development of GERD complications such as adenocarcinoma.

### Evaluation of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^111cj12s]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) may present with heartburn, regurgitation, dysphagia, chronic cough, laryngitis, or even asthma. The clinical presentation of GERD is therefore varied and poses certain challenges to the physician, especially given the limitations of the diagnostic testing.

Discussion

The evaluation of patients with suspected GERD might be challenging. It is based on the evaluation of clinical features, objective evidence of reflux on diagnostic testing, correlation of symptoms with episodes of reflux, evaluation of anatomical abnormalities, and excluding other causes that might account for the presence of the patient's symptoms.

Conclusions

The diagnostic evaluation should include multiple tests, in addition to a thorough clinical examination.

### Gastroesophageal reflux disease [^111zmFDQ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a condition that occurs when reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus causes symptoms and/or complications. The prevalence of GERD in Western societies has been estimated at 30%, making it one of the most commonly encountered disorders in primary care. The spectrum of GERD includes typical symptoms of esophageal reflux (heartburn and/or regurgitation); esophageal injury (erosive esophagitis; stricture; Barrett esophagus; and, rarely, adenocarcinoma); and extraesophageal symptoms, such as hoarseness and chronic cough. Proper diagnosis and treatment of GERD includes symptom control, exclusion of other disorders, avoiding overuse of medications and invasive testing, and minimizing complications.

### Multi-society consensus conference and guideline on the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) [^115Wwe73]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). High credibility.

GERD multi-society guideline — recommendation development and strength criteria are described as patient-centered, with physician panelists using collective patient experience to judge values and preferences, patients not included in panel discussions, and the target audience being patients and their physicians, both surgeons and gastroenterologists. Panelists received a guideline-specific systematic review, reviewed GRADE evidence profiles and summary of findings, completed Evidence-to-Decision (EtD) tables, and generated provisional recommendations; a multi-society conference was held at the SAGES 2021 annual meeting, after which participants voted on the proposed recommendations, and consensus conference voting led to minor changes in the recommendations. Outcomes from Evidence Tables were imported into GRADEPro EtD to determine recommendation direction and strength (strong or conditional) based on the magnitude of desirable and undesirable effects, overall certainty of evidence, variation in values, and the balance of these effects, with consideration of acceptability and feasibility and noting additional considerations from panel expert experience or interpretation of evidence. Strength definitions are explicit: a strong recommendation would be made if high certainty evidence demonstrated that benefits clearly outweigh harms for almost all patients in general or for a subgroup without serious acceptability or feasibility implications, whereas a conditional recommendation would be made when important variability in patient values and preferences means the balance of benefits and harms is likely to differ for a substantial proportion, the balance between desirable and undesirable consequences is close, or the overall certainty of evidence is judged low. Subgroups were further addressed for justification and specified for each key question.

### The many manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease: presentation, evaluation, and treatment [^114teH7d]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common problem that is expensive to diagnose and treat. The disease is increasing in prevalence in the Western world, with important risk factors being obesity and the eradication of Helicobacter pylori. Heartburn and acid regurgitation are classic symptoms of GERD, but their sensitivity is poor. Ambulatory esophageal pH testing is the most sensitive test for GERD, whereas endoscopy is the most specific test. Medical treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) has revolutionized the treatment of GERD and its complications, but long-term side effects do exist. Laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery and PPIs have similar efficacy in the few available long-term trials. This article reviews the presentation, evaluation, and treatment of GERD.

### Can symptoms predict esophageal motor function or acid exposure in gastroesophageal reflux disease? A comparison of esophageal manometric and twenty-four-hour pH parameters in typical and extraesophageal gastroesophageal reflux disease [^117HifKT]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

It has been suggested that patterns of esophageal motor function and acid exposure may differ between those patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with classic symptoms and those with extraesophageal manifestations. Our objective was to compare various parameters of esophageal motility and acid exposure between groups of patients who had presented with extraesophageal manifestations of GERD alone, a combination of classic and extraesophageal manifestations, or classic GERD symptoms alone. A retrospective review of consecutive patients undergoing esophageal manometry and 24-hour dual-channel esophageal pH testing was performed. Information on patient demographics, symptoms, and results of various manometric and pH testing parameters was examined. We evaluated 84 patients: 32 with extraesophageal symptoms alone, 24 with both classic and extraesophageal symptoms, and 28 with classic symptoms alone. Apart from a trend toward less supine acid exposure in those with extraesophageal symptoms alone, no significant differences were evident among the three patient groups in any of the other parameters of proximal or distal esophageal acid reflux. With respect to motility parameters, lower esophageal sphincter pressure was lower in those with combined symptoms; otherwise, manometric findings were similar in the three patient groups. Our data do not support the hypothesis that the nature of the clinical presentation of GERD, whether in the form of classic or extraesophageal manifestations, is related to differing patterns of esophageal motor function or esophageal acid exposure.

### AGA clinical practice update on the diagnosis and management of extraesophageal gastroesophageal reflux disease: expert review [^113c33U2]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

PPI trial — Best Practice Advice 4 states that consideration should be given toward diagnostic testing for reflux before initiation of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy in patients with potential extraesophageal manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) but without typical GERD symptoms, and that an initial single-dose PPI trial, titrating up to twice daily, in those with typical GERD symptoms is reasonable. Best Practice Advice 5 adds that symptom improvement of extraesophageal reflux (EER) manifestations while on PPI therapy may result from mechanisms of action other than acid suppression and should not be regarded as confirmation for GERD. For empiric PPI trials among patients with classic reflux symptoms, a meta-analysis demonstrated sensitivity of 71%–78% and specificity of 41%–54%.

### Classification of adults suffering from typical gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms: contribution of latent class analysis in a European observational study [^11358rFE]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

As illustrated by the Montreal classification, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is much more than heartburn and patients constitute a heterogeneous group. Understanding if links exist between patients' characteristics and GERD symptoms, and classify subjects based on symptom-profile could help to better understand, diagnose, and treat GERD. The aim of this study was to identify distinct classes of GERD patients according to symptom profiles, using a specific statistical tool: Latent class analysis.

Methods

An observational single-visit study was conducted in 5 European countries in 7700 adults with typical symptoms. A latent class analysis was performed to identify "latent classes" and was applied to 12 indicator symptoms.

Results

On 7434 subjects with non-missing indicators, latent class analysis yielded 5 latent classes. Class 1 grouped the highest severity of typical GERD symptoms during day and night, more digestive and non-digestive GERD symptoms, and bad sleep quality. Class 3 represented less frequent and less severe digestive and non-digestive GERD symptoms, and better sleep quality than in class 1. In class 2, only typical GERD symptoms at night occurred. Classes 4 and 5 represented daytime and nighttime regurgitation. In class 4, heartburn was also identified and more atypical digestive symptoms. Multinomial logistic regression showed that country, age, sex, smoking, alcohol use, low-fat diet, waist circumference, recent weight gain (> 5 kg), elevated triglycerides, metabolic syndrome, and medical GERD treatment had a significant effect on latent classes.

Conclusion

Latent class analysis classified GERD patients based on symptom profiles which related to patients' characteristics. Although further studies considering these proposed classes have to be conducted to determine the reproducibility of this classification, this new tool might contribute in better management and follow-up of patients with GERD.

### A socioeconomic perspective on the global burden of gastroesophageal reflux disease (1990–2021): findings from the GBD 2021 [^112vYMSH]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

GERD is defined as the reflux of gastric and duodenal contents into the esophagus. It has emerged as a significant global public health concern, with a prevalence that varies across geographic regions, ranging from approximately 5% to 25% globally. GERD is associated with a spectrum of genetic and behavioral risk factors, including dietary habits, obesity, psychological stress, and the use of certain medications. The disease not only manifests with recurrent symptoms, such as heartburn and regurgitation, but also progresses to serious complications, including esophagitis, esophageal stricture, and esophageal adenocarcinoma. These manifestations significantly compromise patients' quality of life and impose a substantial economic burden on global health care systems.​

The GBD database, a collaborative repository hosted by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington, compiles epidemiological data spanning nearly all countries and regions. This comprehensive resource encompasses key health metrics, including disease incidence, mortality rates, and DALYs, thereby facilitating multidimensional assessments of global health burdens. Since its establishment in 1990, the GBD database has provided longitudinal datasets that support temporal trend analyses and cross-period comparisons. By utilizing standardized methodologies that integrate epidemiological surveillance, statistical modeling, and computational algorithms, the GBD framework ensures robust data validity and cross-regional comparability. Although prior investigations leveraging GBD datasets have documented a progressive increase in the burden of GERD — as evidenced by a 77.53% increase in global cases from 441.57 million (1990) to 783.95 million (2019) — critical knowledge gaps persist. Notably, substantial geographic heterogeneity exists, with the highest age-standardized prevalence rates (ASPR > 12,000 per 100,000 population) concentrated in Latin America, South Asia, North Africa, and the Middle East, whereas East Asian regions, including China, exhibit the lowest ASPR values (< 5%). Despite regular database updates, comprehensive analyses of GERD epidemiology incorporating the latest GBD 2021 release are lacking.

Extraesophageal GERD conclusions — The page emphasizes that "the cause of extraesophageal symptoms in many patients is often multifactorial rather than from reflux alone", and that "Diagnostic testing is recommended after a course of high-dose empiric acid suppression therapy after which symptoms remain". It adds that "Patients with extraesophageal symptoms without concomitant typical reflux symptoms, such as heartburn or regurgitation, are less likely to benefit from aggressive reflux therapies". It further states that "Escalation of therapy may be justified in those with mechanical barrier issues, such as a large hiatal hernia and proven significant reflux", and "In those unresponsive to a course of medical therapy that is proven objectively to control reflux, de-escalation of acid-suppression therapy and investigation into other potential causes for patients' continued extraesophageal reflux are recommended".

Algorithm for suspected extraesophageal reflux disease with concurrent typical symptoms — Patients with extraesophageal reflux symptoms with typical GERD sx are managed with Twice daily PPI therapy for 8–12 weeks. If symptoms resolve, Treat accordingly and Lower PPI to lowest effective dose**, with the note **Consider endoscopy and reflux monitoring to support long-term use of PPI. If symptoms persist, Endoscopy* is performed and, if negative, Ambulatory reflux monitoring off-PPI follows. The figure footnote states *Look for evidence of GERD-related injury or complications and rule out alternative esophageal diseases. The narrative adds that An empiric PPI trial can be considered in patients with extraesophageal and concurrent typical reflux symptoms, whereas early reflux testing should be considered in those with extraesophageal symptoms alone, and To avoid long-term PPI use or a placebo effect, patients responsive to a trial of PPI should be titrated to the lowest effective dose and should be considered for off-therapy endoscopy or reflux testing.

### American Gastroenterological Association medical position statement on the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^115zcP1E]. Gastroenterology (2008). Medium credibility.

Maintenance therapy for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with typical esophageal symptoms (with or without esophagitis): Grade A: strongly recommended based on good evidence that it improves important health outcomes — long-term use of PPIs for the treatment of patients with esophagitis once they have proven clinically effective, and long-term therapy should be titrated down to the lowest effective dose based on symptom control. Grade D: recommend against less than daily dosing of PPI therapy as maintenance therapy in patients with an esophageal GERD syndrome who require maintenance therapy. Subjects not maintained on continuous acid suppressive therapy have high rates of recurrence of erosive disease, the recurrence of erosive esophagitis in subjects with GERD is dramatically decreased by daily PPI treatment, and randomized trials show that subjects randomized to H2RAs are just as likely to have recurrent esophagitis. Patients with uninvestigated GERD or an esophageal GERD syndrome without esophagitis did well with on-demand regimens, and the data suggest that on-demand therapy is a reasonable strategy in patients with an esophageal GERD syndrome without esophagitis, where symptom control is the primary objective.

### The effects of reflux on the elderly: the problems with medications and interventions [^112NpMx4]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Reflux-related complaints are a frequent cause for otolaryngology consultation, and with the aging population the concerns specific to the elderly reflux patient are critical. The elderly patient is less likely to present with typical laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms. Importantly, elderly patients typically have objective findings more severe than the level of the symptoms. Therefore, upfront invasive esophageal testing as opposed to an initial medical therapy trial is the recommended management strategy. For all patients irrespective of age, lifestyle and diet modifications continue to represent the cornerstone of medical management for LPR and GERD.

### Investigation of extraesophageal gastroesophageal reflux disease [^11126SPy]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Concluding remarks

The management of patients with extraesophageal manifestations of GERD remains challenging. In the absence of specific diagnostic methods capable of identifying individuals who might respond to antireflux therapy, an empiric trial of PPI therapy is the common approach. More invasive diagnostic testing should be reserved for those with poor or partial response to the initial PPI therapy to exclude reflux as the cause of patients' persistent symptoms. Future trials are needed to improve these diagnostic problems and identify the subgroup of individuals with extraesophageal reflux manifestations who may benefit from PPI therapy or antireflux surgery.

### Gastroesophageal reflux disease | NEJM resident 360… [^112dujDZ]. resident360.nejm.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Literature Clinical Pearls & Morning Reports Published September 28, 2022 Gastroesophageal reflux disease is a condition in which the reflux of stomach contents causes troublesome symptoms and complications. Read the NEJM Clinical Practice Article here. Clinical Pearls Q: Describe the range of manifestations associated with GERD. A: Although heartburn and regurgitation are considered typical, a broad range of manifestations have been associated with GERD, including chronic cough, a globus sensation, wheezing, posterior laryngitis, dental erosions, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Risk factors for GERD include an age of 50 years or older, current smoking, use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, obesity, low socioeconomic status, and female sex. Q: Of patients with GERD, who should undergo upper endoscopy.

A: Upper endoscopy is generally limited to patients with GERD who report alarm symptoms, who have no response or an incomplete response to treatment or have recurrent GERD after a successful 8-week course of empirical therapy, who are candidates for antireflux or bariatric surgery, or who are at increased risk for Barrett's esophagus. A: Pharmacologic treatment for GERD includes medications taken as needed or daily. The medications that are most frequently used are antacids, histamine2 blockers, and proton pump inhibitors. PPIs are the most effective medication for GERD symptom relief, healing of erosive esophagitis, and prevention of disease relapse and complications.

In a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials of antireflux therapies in patients with erosive esophagitis, the percentage of patients with esophageal healing within 12 weeks after starting treatment was 51. 9% with histamine2-receptor antagonists as compared with
83. 6% with PPIs, and healing was more rapid with PPIs. Moreover, PPIs were superior to histamine2-receptor antagonists in relieving symptoms, maintaining symptom relief, and preventing complications. PPIs should be used at the lowest dose that controls the patient's symptoms and esophageal inflammation, and the appropriateness of treatment should be periodically reevaluated.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) — MSA versus proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy: The panel suggests that adult patients with GERD may benefit from MSA over continued PPI use. (Conditional recommendation based on moderate certainty of evidence). From 74 studies there was a single randomized control trial that guided the panel for decision making; this single study included 158 patients that were followed for one year, and no observational studies met inclusion criteria. Reported benefits included patient reported complete reflux symptom resolution less than 2 years with an absolute difference 795 more patients per 1,000 (95% CI 393 to 1, 524 more) in 1 RCT of 148 participants, reduced need for PPI with an absolute difference 910 fewer patients per 1,000 (95% CI 960 fewer – 770 fewer) in 1 RCT of 134 participants, greater patient satisfaction with an absolute difference 786 more patients per 1,000 (95% CI 181 more to 3,181 more) in 1 RCT of 134 participants, and objective reflux recurrence at 6 months with an absolute difference 38 fewer patients per 1,000 (95% CI 140 fewer to 131 more) in 1 RCT of 158 participants. No undesirable effects were available for this comparison; thus, the magnitude of effect is unknown, and there was not informative data for QoL, patient reported symptom recurrence, dysphagia, hiatal hernia recurrence, complications, mortality, re-operation rates, and cost.

### Multi-society consensus conference and guideline on the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) [^112UgWMz]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). High credibility.

Guideline updating and limitations — SAGES plans to repeat a comprehensive literature review in three years to reevaluate and identify new evidence, and a formal update will be generated when substantial literature is detected. One of the main limitations of this guideline is the low certainty of evidence for most of the KQ, except for KQ3. In addition, patient's values and preferences were not actually obtained and instead the panel's impression of their beliefs was used based on experiences with patients. Insurance coverage and cost to society was not addressed in this guideline as it took a patient-centered perspective. In the development of the recommendations, we were not able to take into account certain aspects of diversity, equity, and inclusion due to unavailability in the literature that was reviewed, thus may limit their generalizability. Specifically, various populations might have been underrepresented in the studies that were evaluated such as ethnic minorities or patients in lower socioeconomic areas.

### Gastroesophageal reflux disease in a typical African population: a symptom-based multicenter study [^114cLEPU]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in Africa is not known but is believed to be increasing because of demographic and epidemiologic transition. The main objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence and risk factors of GERD, and its degree of overlap with dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in Nigeria, a typical African population.

Methods

This was an observational, cross-sectional and descriptive study of adult Nigerians. Diagnosis of GERD was by means of the gastroesophageal reflux disease questionnaire (GERDQ) while the diagnosis of dyspepsia and IBS was based on the Rome III criteria for the diagnosis of functional gastrointestinal disorders. The GERDQ and Rome III questionnaires for dyspepsia and IBS were merged into a composite questionnaire and administered to the study participants who were recruited with a multi-stage sampling technique.

Results

Out of 3520 subjects who participated in the study across the country, 269 (7.6%) satisfied the diagnostic criteria for GERD, while 107 (3.0%) had GERD associated with significant impairment of quality of life. Risk factors of GERD (represented by odds ratios) were age 1.014(95% CI: 1.006–1.022), use of analgesics 1.461 (95% CI: 1.060–2.025), and use of herbs 1.318 (95% CI: 1.020–1.704). Overlap of GERD with dyspepsia and/or IBS was observed in over 50% of cases.

Conclusions

The prevalence of GERD in this study is 7.6%. Age, use of analgesics and use of herbs increase the risk, albeit minimally. A high degree of overlap with dyspepsia and IBS exists in Nigerian patients with GERD.

### Erosive esophagitis and nonerosive reflux disease (NERD): comparison of epidemiologic, physiologic, and therapeutic characteristics [^116DHm4d]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Nonerosive reflux disease (NERD) and erosive esophagitis are the main presentations of gastroesophageal reflux disease. However, NERD is the most common presentation of gastroesophageal reflux disease in community-based patients. Patients with NERD differ in demographic characteristics from patients with erosive esophagitis, primarily in sex distribution, weight/body mass index, and prevalence of hiatal hernia. Physiologically, patients with NERD tend to have normal lower esophageal sphincter resting pressure, minimal esophageal body motility abnormalities, low esophageal acid exposure profile and minimal nighttime esophageal acid exposure. Patients with NERD have a lower symptom response rate to proton pump inhibitor once daily than patients with erosive esophagitis. Additionally, NERD patients demonstrate a longer lag-time for symptom resolution and lack of difference in symptom response rate between half to full dose proton pump inhibitor as compared with patients with erosive esophagitis.

### Epidemiology of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^116dk1tM]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

The prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms increased approximately 50% until the mid-1990s, when it plateaued. The incidence of complications related to GERD including hospitalization, esophageal strictures, esophageal adenocarcinoma, and mortality also increased during that time period, but the increase in esophageal adenocarcinoma has since slowed, and the incidence of strictures has decreased since the mid-1990s. GERD is responsible for the greatest direct costs in the United States of any gastrointestinal disease, and most of those expenditures are for pharmacotherapy. Risk factors for GERD include obesity, poor diet, lack of physical activity, consumption of tobacco and alcohol, and respiratory diseases.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) treatment — conclusions emphasize initial testing and procedural options: Patients with typical symptoms should undergo EGD, manometry, and pH-testing; additional testing may be required for patients with atypical symptoms. MSA or fundoplication are both acceptable. MSA has better outcomes than PPI alone. Patients with normal or abnormal findings on manometry should undergo partial fundoplication. For patients that wish to avoid surgery, Stretta and TIF 2.0 were found to have better outcomes than PPI alone. Patients with concomitant obesity were recommended to undergo either RYGB or fundoplication, although patients with BMI > 50 should undergo RYGB for the additional benefits that follow weight loss and comorbidities resolution.

Other investigational teams performed studies to evaluate patients' symptom profiles in GERD disease. Ponce et al. analyzed the symptom profile of patients with typical GERD manifestations (heartburn and/or regurgitation), comparing untreated patients with those with persistent symptoms despite treatment. A total of 2356 Spanish patients were included in a prospective, observational, cross-sectional study under conditions of standard clinical practice. Dyspeptic symptoms were about 90% in both groups and supra-esophageal ones were also common (50–60%). People with persistent symptoms despite treatment were older, had more supra-esophageal symptoms and the typical and dyspeptic symptoms were more severe in these patients. Older age resulted in a risk factor for supra-esophageal symptoms, female gender for dyspeptic symptoms, and BMI for greater severity of GERD symptoms. In Turkey, Bor et al. performed a study to determine the prevalence and clinical spectrum of GERD in a low-income region. Using a reflux questionnaire validated by Locke et al. at Mayo Clinic, they included 630 randomly selected, low-income participants older than 20 years, living in a population of 8857 Caucasian adults. Their results showed that the prevalence of GERD was similar in low-income populations to that in developed countries, but with a different symptom profile (i.e. a lower incidence of heartburn and a higher incidence of regurgitation and dyspepsia). A comparison between the frequent and the occasional symptom group (i.e. subjects with either of the typical symptoms less than once a week) revealed that only two of the other symptoms, namely dysphagia and odynophagia, were significantly higher in the frequent symptom group. They also found that the prevalence of heartburn symptoms, but not regurgitation, increased significantly with age and that heartburn and regurgitation were both significantly more common in women. In conclusion, both these studies found that dyspeptic symptoms as well as typical and atypical symptoms should all be considered in relation to GERD because they are associated in nearly 50% of patients. Although clinical practice guidelines were closely followed, it seemed that the diagnostic procedures were not always adequate to determine clear different symptom profiles. Thus, our study is an additional attempt to define relevant subgroups in GERD patients, using the LCA.

### ACG clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^116VUm9h]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Endoscopy in extraesophageal GERD — utility and cautions are quantified. In patients with extraesophageal symptoms, "the reported frequency of EE ranges from 18% to 52%". However, EE is not definitive for causation: "EE has been found in 16% of patients with no typical or extraesophageal GERD symptoms in a general population who were undergoing periodic health checkup". A high-grade finding can still guide therapy: "if LA grade C or D EE is present, this establishes a diagnosis of severe GERD and justifies a trial of PPI therapy".

Patient identification for endoscopic screening using demographic and historical models — Models to predict Barrett's esophagus or future esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) show only modest discrimination, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCs) "ranging from 0.61 to 0.75". Adding risk factors to weekly reflux symptoms improved "the reclassification index… by up to 25%". A model incorporating additional variables achieved an "AUROC of 0.75 (95% confidence interval, 0.66–0.84)", and adding alarm symptoms increased discrimination to "an AUROC of 0.85 (95% confidence interval, 0.78–0.91)", with "the risk for EAC… more than 100-fold higher in 50-year-old men who had long-standing GERD symptoms with alarm symptoms than in those without alarm symptoms". Despite these findings, "The clinical usefulness of these models has not been established", and they have informed guidance such that "guidelines do not endorse indiscriminate endoscopic screening of all individuals with GERD symptoms, but only for those with additional risk factors", while highlighting "the exceptionally low risk of EAC for women and young men".

### Reflux and sex: what drives testing, what drives treatment? [^1123tLcB]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) affects ∼10–20% of American adults. Although symptoms are equally common in men and women, we hypothesized that sex influences diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in patients with GER. PubMed database between 1997 and October 2011 was searched for English language studies describing symptoms, consultative visits, endoscopic findings, use and results of ambulatory pH study, and surgical therapy for GER. Using data from Nationwide Inpatient Sample, Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, we determined the sex distribution for admissions and reflux surgery between 1997 and 2008. Studies on symptoms or consultative visits did not show sex-specific differences. Even though women are less likely to have esophagitis or Barrett's esophagus, endoscopic studies enrolled as many women as men, and women were more likely to undergo ambulatory pH studies with a female predominance in studies from the US. Surgical GER treatment is more commonly performed in men. However, studies from the US showed an equal sex distribution, with Nationwide Inpatient Sample data demonstrating an increase in women who accounted for 63% of the annual fundoplications in 2008. Despite less common or severe mucosal disease, women are more likely to undergo invasive diagnostic testing. In the US, women are also more likely to undergo antireflux surgery. These results suggest that healthcare-seeking behavior and socioeconomic factors rather than the biology of disease influence the clinical approaches to reflux disease.

### Extraesophageal presentations of GERD: where is the science? [^112ZzBqJ]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

This article reviews the evaluation and management of patients with suspected extraesophageal manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease, such as asthma, chronic cough, and laryngitis, which are commonly encountered in gastroenterology practices. Otolaryngologists and gastroenterologists commonly disagree upon the underlying cause for complaints in patients with one of the suspected extraesophageal reflux syndromes. The accuracy of diagnostic tests (laryngoscopy, endoscopy, and pH- or pH-impedance monitoring) for patients with suspected extraesophageal manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease is suboptimal. An empiric trial of proton pump inhibitors in patients without alarm features can help some patients, but the response to therapy is variable.

### GERD evaluation: time for a new paradigm? [^1157VSjY]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

In the past there has been reliance on heartburn and acid regurgitation as the cardinal symptoms of gastro-esophageal reflux. Now it is recognized that diverse additional symptoms including extraesophageal manifestations are essential components of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Furthermore, previous reliance in mucosal damage at endoscopy as evidence of therapeutic success in the management of GERD has proven of only limited value in the diverse world of GERD symptoms. Indeed is now apparent that the relationship between symptoms and lesions is modest at best. Most patients with GERD have no overt erosions or ulceration at endoscopy and they frequently suffer from a wide array of complaints other than heartburn that contribute to their diminished perception of life's quality. To address these problems, multidimensional questionnaires designed to encompass the diverse symptomatology of GERD have been investigated, principally, to provide a reproducible metric of change in the subjective response to pharmacologic therapy during trials for patients with nonerosive reflux disease. The most promising of these instruments is The ReQuest questionnaire, because it has been extensively validated in multiple patient groups and cultures, appears highly promising in this regard and for erosive disease too and may ultimately prove to be of value for the initial evaluation of patients with GERD. We propose that accurate symptom delineation complemented with endoscopy performed in selected groups of patients will become the mainstay in diagnosis of GERD and the assessment of therapy efficacy.

### ACG clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^116Noc48]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Extraesophageal GERD symptoms — diagnostic and treatment recommendations emphasize conservative attribution and objective testing. "We recommend evaluation for non-GERD causes in patients with possible extraesophageal manifestations before ascribing symptoms to GERD". "We recommend that patients who have extraesophageal manifestations of GERD without typical GERD symptoms (e.g., heartburn and regurgitation) undergo reflux testing for evaluation before PPI therapy". For those with both typical and extraesophageal symptoms, "we suggest considering a trial of twice-daily PPI therapy for 8–12 weeks before additional testing". Endoscopy is discouraged as a standalone diagnostic for extraesophageal syndromes: "We suggest that upper endoscopy should not be used as the method to establish a diagnosis of GERD-related asthma, chronic cough, or laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR)". Procedural interventions require proof of reflux: "In patients treated for extraesophageal reflux disease, surgical or endoscopic antireflux procedures are only recommended in patients with objective evidence of reflux".

### Classification of adults suffering from typical gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms: contribution of latent class analysis in a European observational study [^117We4EE]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Using a LCA based on 12 indicator variables, representing typical and atypical symptoms of GERD, warning signs, and sleep disturbances, 5 symptom profile classes were identified in 7434 European GERD patients. Because no statistical tool allows to determine the optimal number of classes that mirror real life, the final decision to go for a classification in 5 classes (rather than in 6 or 7 classes) was taken according to an expert-investigators'consensus. This consensus was based, on one side, on clinical experience and practice and, on the other side, on practical considerations as using a relatively low number of classes (i.e. 5 classes) when a relatively limited number of indicators (i.e. 12 indicators) are evaluated. Our opinion is that this approach will increase the probability for clinicians to appropriate themselves such a classification; of course, the relevance of the classification in 5 classes should be prospectively tested in usual care conditions.

The clinical presentation of eosinophilic esophagitis in adults is varied but most often starts with some form of dysphagia. These patients often may be diagnosed incorrectly as having gastroesophageal reflux disease or functional disease, given the paucity of objective endoscopy and radiographic findings in some patients, even though symptoms often are severe and persistent. A careful history with attention to detail and a compilation of compatible characteristics is key to the clinician's diagnosing eosinophilic esophagitis in an adult.

### Managing gastroesophageal reflux disease for the lifetime of the patient: evaluating the long-term options [^113wjhj1]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Lifetime management goals of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are to control esophageal as well as extraesophageal symptoms, maintain a stable noninflamed esophageal mucosa, and prevent complications. Large randomized clinical trials and > 16 years of worldwide experience have confirmed the high rate of efficacy and excellent safety profile of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy in individuals with all grades of GERD, making these agents the mainstay of treatment. Despite these outcomes, some individuals may desire an alternative to pharmacologic therapy. In such patients, laparoscopic fundoplication may produce symptom relief and healing of esophagitis, but its invasiveness, cost, and inherent surgical risks have created an interest in a variety of endoscopic therapies for reflux disease. Several short-term uncontrolled trials of these endoscopic therapies have reported encouraging preliminary results; however, careful patient selection as well as clinician experience is critical for their success. In addition to clinician expertise with the procedure, success has been observed only in patients with nonerosive GERD and a hiatal hernia < 3 cm, abnormal pH monitoring, and normal esophageal motility studies, as well as in those who have experienced at least partial symptom relief with PPI therapy. Endoscopic therapy should not be considered the standard of care in patients with erosive disease or large hiatal hernias.

If typical GERD plus extraesophageal symptoms are present, begin a PPI Trial BID up to 12 weeks. If extraesophageal symptoms only are present, proceed directly to reflux monitoring off PPI, and subsequent steps include consideration of pH-impedance monitoring.

### ACG clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^117W2crj]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Extraesophageal gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) — surgical outcomes and patient selection are described as follows: In 1 study of patients with extraesophageal symptoms, predictors of symptomatic improvement after surgery included the presence of heartburn with or without regurgitation and abnormal acid exposure time on pH testing. One retrospective cohort study compared adults with extraesophageal GERD (n = 36) and typical reflux symptoms (n = 79), all of whom had abnormal distal esophageal acid exposure, and recurrence of symptoms after surgery was more likely in patients with extraesophageal symptoms and in those who had a poor response to preoperative PPI therapy. The range of reported improvement in extraesophageal symptoms was wide, ranging from 15% to 95%, with extraesophageal symptoms having poorer response to surgical treatment than typical GERD symptoms. At 1 year, only 10% of patients who underwent surgery and 7% of patients who continued medical therapy for GERD had improvement in laryngeal symptoms, whereas two-thirds of patients who pursued nonsurgical, non-GERD treatments had improved symptoms at 1 year. Patients with extraesophageal symptoms that do not respond to PPIs and patients without objective evidence of reflux should avoid surgical or endoscopic treatment of GERD.

Methods

Study design and patients' characteristics

Between 2005 and 2007, a cohort of patients with GERD and individuals lacking any symptom or endoscopic sign of GERD as GERD-negative controls were enrolled. Patients with typical GERD-related symptoms based on Montreal classification and patients without any reflux-related clinical symptoms undergoing EGD for screening or non-reflux dyspepsia (GERD-negative controls with a reflux disease questionnaire, RDQ score of 0) were invited to participate. All the patients underwent a detailed history and physical examination. The demographic data and endoscopic findings of the study population are presented in Table 1 A and Table 1 B. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients before endoscopy, after the endoscopist had explained the procedure to the patient in detail and answered all questions. The study was approved by the ethical committee of our institution and conducted according to the ethical guidelines of the declaration of Helsinki as revised in 1989.

Table 1
Patient groups analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry

Functional investigations such as 24 hour-pH-metry or MII-pH analysis were performed in individual cases only, and could not be included as separate parameter. The assignment of NERD was additionally based on the responsiveness to PPI therapy that was subsequently assessed.

Inclusion criteria

Female or male, age 18 to 80, able to provide written informed consent. Patients with typical reflux symptoms had to present symptoms at least three times a week. Typical reflux symptoms were defined as heartburn and regurgitation, as evaluated by the RDQ score. Patients with other types of reflux symptoms were not included in this study.

Exclusion criteria

Upper gastrointestinal pathology (e.g. peptic ulcers, cancers, polyps, and Barrett's mucosa), systemic inflammatory, neoplastic or malabsorptive diseases (e.g. Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, vasculitis, celiac disease), and acute medical conditions such as pneumonia, stroke, coronary ischemia and acute renal failure. Patients with known abnormal coagulation parameters and thrombocytopenia at the time of the procedure (i.e. INR > 1.2, platelet count < 80,000) were also excluded. None of the patients had taken antibiotics, or bismuth compounds or any H2-blockers or proton-pump inhibitors (PPI) in the last 2 weeks before entering the study. It is notable that the majority of patients enrolled had various anti-secretory medications in their past, and does not present GERD-naïve patients. Each patient was assigned a coded number. Histopathological assessment was done by pathologist (DK) blinded to clinical data.

A third limitation is that our case definition required an individual to have typical reflux symptoms at least weekly for 12 months. This definition is consistent with a published meta-analysisand similar to expert group recommendations for population-based research on gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, but might miss individuals who have appreciable symptoms over shorter periods of time, those who have atypical symptoms, and those who have asymptomatic mucosal injury and risk of complications. Future rounds of GBD should estimate burden due to these additional presentations of the disease. Conversely, symptom-based definitions might include individuals with similar symptoms not due to reflux of stomach contents, such as those with functional dyspepsia. Differences might exist in the association between symptoms and findings on diagnostic studies by location. Validation studies in representative populations should be done to estimate the predictive value of symptom-based questionnaires compared to more comprehensive and specific case definitions.

Finally, health loss due to conditions for which gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is a risk factor (such as oesophageal carcinoma) is accounted for in separate GBD estimates, but the relationship to gastro-oesophageal reflux disease should be made more explicit in future rounds to fully account for the effect of this disease on human health.

Our study has several strengths. We have incorporated more prevalence data sources than previously published systematic reviews and one previous meta-analysis. More importantly, GBD 2017 is, to our knowledge, the first study to apply methods of meta-regression to estimate the prevalence of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, which offers several advantages. Rather than qualitatively assessing the differences in study design that might explain differences in estimates of epidemiological measures from diverse sources, we have accounted quantitatively for many of these important differences using fixed effects for study-level covariates. Rather than reporting estimates only for age groups, years, and locations for which prevalence data have been collected, we have generated estimates for all age groups, years, and locations, incorporating information from adjacent age groups, years, and locations to calculate the best possible prevalence estimates where no data are available. Although estimates for locations without data are less certain, they provide policy makers and other stakeholders with the best available knowledge about the possible extent of this problem, and a tool by which to gauge the value of further research on this disease relative to expenditures in other areas.

### Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease [^1118SNyU]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2021). High credibility.

Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common disorder in adults and children. The global prevalence of GERD is high and increasing. Non-erosive reflux disease is the most common phenotype of GERD. Heartburn and regurgitation are considered classic symptoms but GERD may present with various atypical and extra-oesophageal manifestations. The pathophysiology of GERD is multifactorial and different mechanisms may result in GERD symptoms, including gastric composition and motility, anti-reflux barrier, refluxate characteristics, clearance mechanisms, mucosal integrity and symptom perception. In clinical practice, the diagnosis of GERD is commonly established on the basis of response to anti-reflux treatment; however, a more accurate diagnosis requires testing that includes upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy and reflux monitoring. New techniques and new reflux testing parameters help to better phenotype the condition. In children, the diagnosis of GERD is primarily based on history and physical examination and treatment vary with age. Treatment in adults includes a combination of lifestyle modifications with pharmacological, endoscopic or surgical intervention. In refractory GERD, optimization of proton-pump inhibitor treatment should be attempted before a series of diagnostic tests to assess the patient's phenotype.

### Associations between socio-demographic factors, social functioning, and sleep quality among GERD patients in syria: a cross-sectional study [^115k5kwH]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic digestive disorder characterized by reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus, leading to symptoms such as heartburn, regurgitation, and chest discomfort. It is a prevalent condition globally, significantly impacting patients' quality of life and contributing to various health complications when left unmanaged. GERD is associated with complications such as esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, and an increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma, necessitating timely and effective management. Additionally, chronic GERD can lead to dental erosion due to sustained acid exposure and may contribute to respiratory conditions such as COPD, bronchitis, pneumonia, lung cancer and pulmonary embolism.

The diagnosis of GERD is typically based on patient-reported symptoms and medical history, complemented by diagnostic procedures such as endoscopy or esophageal pH monitoring when required to confirm acid reflux. Management strategies for GERD prioritize lifestyle modifications, including weight loss, dietary adjustments, and smoking cessation, as these measures are essential for symptom relief and disease control. Pharmacological treatments, such as antacids, H2 receptor antagonists, and proton pump inhibitors, are frequently employed to reduce gastric acid production and alleviate symptoms. In severe or refractory cases, surgical interventions like fundoplication may be performed to reinforce the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and prevent reflux. A global consensus has been reached that the primary goals of GERD treatment should focus on alleviating symptoms and preventing complications.

Most importantly, endoscopically monitoring patients with chronic GERD symptoms has not been shown to diminish the risk of cancer, and this practice is discouraged.

### Risk factors associated with functional esophageal disorders (FED) versus gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) [^11683YzS]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite the high prevalence of typical symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), approximately 30% of patients have functional esophageal disorders (FED) on ambulatory reflux monitoring, which may include reflux hypersensitivity (RH; defined as physiologic acid exposure but temporally correlated symptoms of reflux), or functional heartburn (FH; defined as physiologic acid exposure and negative symptom correlation). There are limited epidemiological data characterizing these conditions. We investigated demographic and socioeconomic factors as well as medical comorbidities which may predispose to FED versus pathologic GERD.

Methods

Adult patients with reflux symptoms for at least 3 months were studied with 24-h pH-impedance testing from 11/2019 to 3/2021. Participants were categorized into pathologic GERD, FH, or RH using pH-impedance data and reported symptom correlation. Demographic data, including age, gender, race/ethnicity, zip code, insurance status, and medical comorbidity data were retrospectively retrieved from the electronic medical record on all participants.

Results

229 patients were included. Non-Hispanic Asian ethnicity (OR5.65; p = 0.01), underweight BMI (OR 7.33; p = 0.06), chronic pain (OR2.33; p < 0.01), insomnia (OR2.83; p = 0.06), and allergic rhinitis (OR3.90; p < 0.01) were associated with a greater risk for FED. Overweight BMI (OR 0.48; p = 0.03) and alcohol use (OR 0.57; p = 0.06) were associated with a decreased risk for FED.

Discussion

This is the first report of a greater risk of FED in patients with underweight BMI, insomnia, chronic pain, allergic rhinitis, or of Asian or Hispanic ethnicities. The weak associations between female gender and anxiety are corroborated in other studies. Our findings enable clinicians to better screen patients with reflux for this disorder.

Figure 1
Schematic presentation of epidemiological trends in GORD-related disorders. While typical GERD symptoms are balanced between comparator groups, the distribution of complications becomes progressively skewed in gender, geographic and racial distribution. *GORD symptoms are similar between Western and Middle Eastern countries, but are lower in Eastern countries.

Figure 2
Age-adjusted incidence rates of oesophageal adenocarcinoma for men and women in 1998–2002 in several regions. Reference population is world standard population (2000).

Stories behind the trends

Rising rates of obesity together with declining rates of Helicobacter pylori infection are likely behind the observed increase in early onset GORD. The result is a larger number of people living with chronic GORD and, thus, at high risk for developing BO and OAC. The increasing prevalence of abdominal obesity also independently increases the risk of BO and OAC. These factors underlie some of the observed geographic, gender and racial differences.

Obesity is associated with a significant increase in the risk for GORD. However, waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio have been shown to correlate more strongly than BMI with the risk of EO, BOand OAC. In a recent meta-analysis, patients with central adiposity had a higher risk of EO (19 studies; OR, 1.87; 95% CI 1.51 to 2.31), BO (17 studies; OR, 1.98; 95% CI 1.52 to 2.57) and OAC (OR, 2.51; 95% CI 1.54 to 4.06) compared with subjects of normal body habitus and the association between central adiposity and BO persisted after adjusting for BMI (5 studies; OR, 1.88; 95% CI 1.20 to 2.95). Furthermore, a reflux-independent association of central adiposity and BO was observed in studies that used GORD patients as controls or adjusted for GORD symptoms (11 studies; OR, 2.04; 95% CI 1.44 to 2.90). These findings support a role for central adiposity, independent of BMI in increasing the risk of BO and OAC with its effects mediated by reflux-dependent and reflux-independent mechanisms.

We recommend that patients who have extraesophageal manifestations of GERD without typical GERD symptoms (e.g., heartburn and regurgitation) undergo reflux testing for evaluation before PPI therapy. For patients who have both extraesophageal and typical GERD symptoms, we suggest considering a trial of twice-daily PPI therapy for 8–12 wk before additional testing. We suggest that upper endoscopy should not be used as the method to establish a diagnosis of GERD-related asthma, chronic cough, or LPR.

### Artificial neural networks are able to recognize gastro-oesophageal reflux disease patients solely on the basis of clinical data [^114DDrHh]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Artificial neural networks (ANN) are modelling mechanisms that are highly flexible and adaptive to solve the non-linearity inherent in the relationship between symptoms and underlying pathology.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of ANN in achieving a diagnosis of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) using oesophagoscopy or pH-metry as a diagnostic gold standard and discriminant analysis as a statistical comparator technique in a group of patients with typical GORD symptoms and with or without GORD objective findings (e.g. a positive oesophagoscopy or a pathological oesophageal pH-metry).

Methods

The sample of 159 cases (88 men, 71 women) presenting with typical symptoms of GORD, were subdivided on the basis of endoscopy and pH-metry results into two groups: GORD patients with or without oesophagitis, group 1 (N = 103), and pH and endoscopy-negative patients in whom both examinations were negative, group 2 (N = 56). A total of 101 different independent variables were collected: demographic information, medical history, generic health state and lifestyle, intensity and frequency of typical and atypical symptoms based on the Italian version of the Gastroesophageal Reflux Questionnaire (Mayo Clinic). The diagnosis was used as a dependent variable. Different ANN models were assessed.

Results

Specific evolutionary algorithms selected 45 independent variables, concerning clinical and demographic features, as predictors of the diagnosis. The highest predictive performance was achieved by a 'back propagation' ANN, which was consistently 100% accurate in identifying the correct diagnosis compared with 78% obtained by traditional discriminant analysis.

Conclusion

On the basis of this preliminary work, the use of ANN seems to be a promising approach for predicting diagnosis without the need for invasive diagnostic methods in patients suffering from GORD symptoms.

### Infantile gastroesophageal reflux in a hospital setting [^1131N8LW]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Gastroesophageal reflux, defined by the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition as the passage of gastric contents into the esophagus, is common in infants. Yet, there is no information on the demographics of children who have reflux and require hospitalization. Most often the clinical diagnosis of reflux and the decision to employ therapeutic interventions is made by clinicians based on signs and symptoms presented by the patient. Therefore, we used the diagnosis that clinicians assigned to their hospitalized patients to identify patients for inclusion in the study. For this report, we defined primary reflux as reflux that was the primary reason for hospitalization and secondary reflux as reflux that was not the primary reason for hospitalization.

We hypothesized that reflux is an important cause for hospitalizations for children ≤ 2 years of age, that reflux frequently occurs concomitantly with other diseases and that infants born prematurely (< 37 weeks gestation) who were admitted to the hospital with reflux had different characteristics than those who were born at term (≥ 37 weeks gestation). We also hypothesized that demographic data might identify children diagnosed with reflux who are at increased risk for hospitalization. This study was designed to describe the incidence, evaluation, and treatment of children with the most severe reflux, those requiring admission to the hospital, during the first two years of life. This manuscript reports on the demographics of the study children. The data did not allow us to determine the extent reflux contributed to the child's illness, only that it was present. Because the study contained thousands of data points for each category, this report focuses only on the demographic characteristics of the patients. Laboratory, therapeutic, financial and outcomes of the study patients will be presented in subsequent manuscripts.

### Reflux disease: the disorder of the third millennium [^1124U6Bm]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) affects a large group of patients and has a negative impact on quality of life. In addition, this disorder is associated with considerable long-term morbidity and mortality. In Western countries, between 10% and 30% of the population is affected by GORD. Symptoms of GORD include retrosternal burning and regurgitation, which are highly predictive of acid exposure to the oesophageal mucosa. However, erosions or ulcers in the oesophageal mucosa occur in fewer than 30% of patients with this disorder as assessed by current endoscopic techniques. Treatment of symptoms in this patient population is nonetheless of paramount importance. Current data indicate that the prevalence of GORD is increasing in the population as a whole. Although the exact reasons for this increase are unknown, changes in diet and lifestyle may play some role. Furthermore, a decreasing prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in the population, which is thought to exert some protection against GORD, may also be involved. Along with the increasing prevalence of GORD is an increase in GORD-related complications, including Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Given the delay in onset of these GORD-associated complications, these findings are particularly alarming. As these trends continue, current techniques for the treatment of GORD will need to be refined and reevaluated in terms of quality-of-life issues, health care utilization, and cost-efficacy. Treatment of GORD in the future will require effective techniques to control symptoms, maintain remission, and prevent complications in the affected patient.

### Classification of adults suffering from typical gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms: contribution of latent class analysis in a European observational study [^115qjBEX]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

The LCA applied to eating behavior and physical activity have also provided useful results in determining subtypes of children using multiple dimensions of obesity risks and interesting results have also been reported in weight loss strategies among women, parenting characteristics associated with children's BMI, and maternal pregnancy weight associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in their offspring.

The results of our LCA have shown that a person-centered analytical approach could be an effective method to determine a classification of adults suffering from typical GERD symptoms and to describe the most frequent symptom profiles and characteristics. Among patients complaining from at least one of the major symptoms of GERD, i.e. heartburn or regurgitation, subgroups exist. This is an important point to be considered for patients' management in the clinical practice. Indeed, besides heartburn and regurgitation, other symptoms often exist and have to be taken into account in order to provide to the patient an overall and satisfactory symptoms relief. We can speculate that patients'expectations are not the same between, for instance, Class 5 patients suffering only from daytime heartburn and patients from Class 2 or 3 with also nocturnal typical symptoms, a medium probability of atypical symptoms and sleep disorders. Of course, from a clinical perspective, the relevance of this classification should be prospectively tested in further interventional studies and/or in real world setting. These findings may call for refinement of GERD programs, as to our knowledge, this is one of the first attempts in GERD research to estimate latent classes of symptom profiles and characteristics. As this study only comprised one visit, symptom changes over time have not been investigated. Patients could switch classes throughout time due to changes in e.g. therapy, lifestyle habits. However, incorporating these different classes into GERD diagnosis could help in determining a specific patient profile and a specific treatment approach.

### Gastroesophageal reflux disease and morbid obesity: is there a relation? [^112gSyFf]. World Journal of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is highly prevalent in morbidly obese patients, and a high body mass index (BMI) is a risk factor for the development of GERD. However, the mechanism by which the BMI affects esophageal acid exposure is not completely understood. Although many advances have been made in the understanding of the pathophysiology of GERD, many aspects of the pathophysiology of this disease in morbidly obese patients remain unclear. The following review describes the current evidence linking esophageal reflux to obesity, covering the pathophysiology of the disease and the implications for treatment of GERD in the obese patient.

### Laryngopharyngeal reflux symptoms better predict the presence of esophageal adenocarcinoma than typical gastroesophageal reflux symptoms [^113P832M]. Annals of Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether the presence of laryngopharyngeal reflux symptoms is associated with the presence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC).

Background

Most patients diagnosed with EAC have incurable disease at the time of detection. The majority of these patients are unaware of the presence of Barrett's esophagus prior to cancer diagnosis and many do not report typical symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). This suggests that the current GERD symptom-based screening paradigm may be inadequate. Data support a causal relation between complicated GERD and laryngopharyngeal reflux symptoms. We theorize that laryngopharyngeal reflux symptoms are not recognized expeditiously, resulting in chronic esophageal injury and an unrecognized progression of Barrett's esophagus to EAC.

Methods

This is a case-comparison (control) study. Cases were patients diagnosed with EAC (n = 63) between 1997 and 2002. Three comparison groups were selected: 1) Barrett's esophagus patients without dysplasia (n = 50), 2) GERD patients without Barrett's esophagus (n = 50), and 3) patients with no history of GERD symptoms or antisecretory medication use (n = 56). The risk factors evaluated included demographics, medical history, lifestyle variables, and laryngopharyngeal reflux symptoms. Typical GERD symptoms and antisecretory medication use were recorded. Multivariate analysis of demographics, comorbid risk factors, and symptoms was performed with logistic regression to provide odds ratios for the probability of EAC diagnosis.

Results

The prevalence of patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux symptoms was significantly greater in the cases than comparison groups (P = 0.0005). The prevalence of laryngopharyngeal reflux symptoms increased as disease severity progressed from the non-GERD comparison group (19.6%) to GERD (26%), Barrett's esophagus (40%), and EAC patients (54%). Symptoms of GERD were less prevalent in cases (43%) when compared with Barrett's esophagus (66%) and GERD (86%) control groups (P < 0.001). Twenty-seven percent (17 of 63) of EAC patients never had GERD or laryngopharyngeal reflux symptoms. Fifty-seven percent of EAC patients presented without ever having typical GERD symptoms. Chronic cough, diabetes, and age emerged as independent risk factors for the development of EAC.

Conclusions

Symptoms of laryngopharyngeal reflux are more prevalent in patients with EAC than typical GERD symptoms and may represent the only sign of disease. Chronic cough is an independent risk factor associated with the presence of EAC. Addition of laryngopharyngeal reflux symptoms to the current Barrett's screening guidelines is warranted.

GORD epidemiology and some fascinating trends behind that epidemiology

The global burden of GORD is increasing; data from 28 studies of GORD prevalence (defined by either typical symptoms at least once weekly or the Montreal definition) indicate estimates of 18.1–27.8% in North America, 8.8–25.9% in Europe, 2.5–7.8% in East Asia, 8.7–33.1% in the Middle East, 11.6% in Australia, and 23.0% in South America. Furthermore, the prevalence of GORD is ≈50% higher in the USA, Europe and East Asia in studies carried out after 1995 compared to those carried out before 1995. The incidence of GORD per 1000 person-years is approximately 5.0 in the overall UK and US populations, and 0.84 in UK paediatric patients aged 1–17 years.

The incidence and mortality rates of oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC) have also been increasing in regions of North America, Europe and Australia. The risk of OAC increases with age, peaking at the 7th–8th decade of life. However, people born in more recent years have a higher incidence of OAC, independent of age. This birth cohort phenomenon implicates an early life exposure that increased the risk of OAC in successive generations.

There are remarkable variations in the distribution of GORD-related disorders (reflux symptoms, EO, Barrett's oesophagus (BO), and OAC) related to sex, race and geographic regions (figure 1). Similar proportions of men and women report GORD symptoms, but increasingly greater proportions of men than women are affected with EO (≈60%), BO (≈70%), and OAC (≈80%). Similarly, the prevalence of EO, BO and OAC are remarkably low in endoscopic series from East Asia (figure 2). Lastly, within some regions, there exist racial and ethnic variations exemplified by differences between whites and blacks in the USA, such that GORD symptoms are similar between the two groups, but whites are disproportionately affected with EO (60%), BO (≈70%) and OAC (fivefold higher incidence among whites than blacks).

### ACG clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^116na89S]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for gastroesophageal reflux disease, more specifically with respect to patients with extraesophageal symptoms, evaluation, ACG 2022 guidelines recommend to perform upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, ideally off PPIs for 2–4 weeks, if patients with extraesophageal symptoms have not responded to a trial of twice-daily PPIs. Consider obtaining reflux monitoring if the endoscopy is normal.

### Systematic review on epidemiology of gastroesophageal reflux disease in Asia [^115iupmA]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The epidemiology of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) has been a subject of much interest in recent years. This review ascertains the prevalence of GERD in eastern and southeastern Asia, and reports on complications and risk factors.

Methods

This qualitative systematic review of the epidemiology of GERD in eastern and southeastern Asia identified studies in adults reported in English in the Medline database (searched through April 2005), relevant reviews, and our own bibliographic databases.

Results

Thirteen studies were included. The reported population prevalence of GERD in eastern Asia ranged from 2.5% to 6.7% for at least weekly symptoms of heartburn and/or acid regurgitation and may be increasing. No reliable data are available on the prevalence of esophagitis in the general population. In case studies, the prevalence of reflux esophagitis ranged from 3.4% to 16.3%. Well-established risk factors for GERD in Asian populations included hiatus hernia and obesity. Age and male sex also may be risk factors. Chest pain is the predominant extraesophageal manifestation of GERD in China, whereas in Japan, a link with asthma has been implicated in patients with severe esophagitis.

Conclusions

There is a paucity of studies reporting the prevalence of GERD in eastern and southeastern Asia. These results highlight the need for further epidemiologic studies using representative study populations and a standardized methodology. Recognition and awareness of GERD need to increase concomitantly to ensure appropriate diagnosis and treatment of the disease.

### Multi-society consensus conference and guideline on the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) [^116GsK78]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). High credibility.

Certainty in the evidence of effects and decision criteria for GERD surgery in patients with obesity note that the confidence interval for subjective reflux symptom resolution is compatible with clinically relevant, albeit small, benefits to clinically relevant, albeit small, harms for patient symptom resolution. The certainty of evidence was deemed to be very low for outcomes considered critical or important to decision making, including patient reported symptom improvement (critical), patient reported symptom recurrence (critical), perioperative complications (important), perioperative mortality (important) and need for reoperation (important), with limitations from unclear risks of bias and wide CI which increase the imprecision of the results. Due to the important variability in patient values, particularly the value of weight loss versus GERD resolution, the panelists felt that despite the balance of effects, that either RYGB or redo fundoplication may be chosen for patients with both GERD and obesity.

Endoscopy in long-term management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) — Grade B: endoscopy with biopsy is recommended for patients with an esophageal GERD syndrome with troublesome dysphagia, and biopsies should target suspected metaplasia or dysplasia or, if no visual abnormalities, normal mucosa with at least 5 samples to evaluate for eosinophilic esophagitis; Grade Insuff.: there is no recommendation for routine upper endoscopy to diminish death from esophageal cancer or for endoscopic screening for Barrett's esophagus and dysplasia in adults 50 years or older with > 5–10 years of heartburn to reduce mortality from esophageal adenocarcinoma; because PPI treatment is usually begun before testing, the sensitivity of endoscopy for GERD is poor and its principal use is evaluation of treatment failures and risk management; moreover, no direct data substantiate screening or surveillance endoscopy for Barrett's esophagus, and an AGA Institute group rejected statements claiming mortality benefit and the corollary that screening should be performed in all adults ≥ 50 years with > 5–10 years of heartburn.

### Classification of adults suffering from typical gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms: contribution of latent class analysis in a European observational study [^114rUQMH]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Results

Participants

Overall, 7917 subjects, enrolled in five countries (France, Greece, Italy, Russia, and Spain), participated in this single-visit observational study. The per-protocol population consisted of 7700 subjects and the primary analysis was performed on 7434 subjects. The subject's overall characteristics can be found in Additional file 2. Although the primary analysis set was less than the calculated sample size, the representativeness of the effective sample was not affected, because the sample size was based on the theoretically possible number of unique symptom profiles and the included subjects presented approximately 1400 different profiles.

Indications for objective testing in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) — If troublesome heartburn, regurgitation, and/or non-cardiac chest pain do not respond adequately to a PPI trial or if alarm symptoms exist, clinicians should investigate with endoscopy and, in the absence of erosive reflux disease (Los Angeles B or greater) or long-segment (≥ 3 cm) Barrett's esophagus, perform prolonged wireless pH monitoring off medication (96-hour preferred if available) to confirm and phenotype or to rule out GERD; in addition, clinicians should perform upfront objective reflux testing (rather than an empiric PPI trial) in patients with isolated extra-esophageal symptoms and suspicion of reflux etiology; if PPI therapy is continued in a patient with unproven GERD, clinicians should evaluate the appropriateness and dosing within 12 months after initiation and offer endoscopy with prolonged wireless reflux monitoring off PPI therapy, with endoscopy and prolonged reflux monitoring optimally performed after withholding PPI for 2 to 4 weeks whenever possible.

### Gastroesophageal reflux disease [^116VHeGq]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) affects many patients and has a negative effect on quality of life. Along with the increasing prevalence of GERD is an increase in GERD-related complications, including Barrett esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma. The past year has yielded new insights into the pathophysiology of GERD that can help us to better understand the relationship between reflux episodes and symptoms of mucosal damage and to provide a tailored treatment targeting individual pathophysiologic defects. The issues addressed in this report include gastric secretory and motor dysfunction; failure of the antireflux barrier caused by hiatal hernia and transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations; characterization of the refluxate, particularly of nonacid reflux; prevalence and prognostic value of esophageal dysmotility in GERD; presence and eradication of Helicobacter pylori; Barrett esophagus and extraesophageal manifestations of GERD; and, finally, advances in medical, endoscopic, and surgical treatments of GERD.
