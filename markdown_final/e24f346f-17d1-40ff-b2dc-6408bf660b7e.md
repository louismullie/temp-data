facial numbness and tingling without any weakness. Ddx?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the differential diagnosis of isolated facial numbness or tingling without weakness. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about anatomic localization within trigeminal (CN V) sensory territories versus facial nerve (CN VII) motor function. Then, I should separate peripheral trigeminal processes from central brainstem causes by onset, distribution, and associated signs. Next, I will organize the differential across primary trigeminal neuropathies, central lesions, systemic-metabolic and autoimmune causes, neoplastic and toxic processes, followed by red flags, targeted diagnostics, and focused management strategies with appropriate follow-up and vigilance for evolving disease [^116qFQZM] [^112dEiLC] [^112b9EK7].

> Let me first confirm localization. Isolated sensory change in the face maps to CN V divisions (V1 forehead/eye–V2 cheek/upper lip–V3 lower lip/chin), whereas Bell's palsy is a CN VII motor syndrome with weakness and not pure numbness; wait, I initially considered Bell's palsy for "facial numbness", but that would be incorrect because Bell's palsy is weakness, not sensory loss, so I should correct that assumption and keep focus on trigeminal pathways and their central connections [^112dEiLC] [^113HC6M5] [^116qFQZM].

> I need to characterize the pattern. Unilateral versus bilateral, single-division versus multifocal involvement, temporal profile (abrupt, subacute, chronic), and presence or absence of pain or triggers all refine localization; I should also check for accompanying ocular surface, corneal, or intraoral sensory changes that track with V1–V3, because anatomically consistent territory supports a trigeminal process and helps direct subsequent imaging and laboratory workup [^112dEiLC] [^114Fusdq].

> Next, I will examine primary trigeminal neuropathies. Benign or idiopathic trigeminal sensory neuropathy presents with pure sensory loss and may have normal or nonspecific MRI; importantly, transient enhancement of the trigeminal nerve or Meckel's cave can mimic a small neuroma but may regress without surgery, so I need to avoid overcalling neoplasm and consider interval imaging when clinical features are otherwise reassuring [^112pCcyx] [^1172ECY1] [^112KCyFM]. Post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathy is common after dental procedures or facial trauma, typically confined to the injured branch and sometimes evolving into painful dysesthesias, so I should carefully review dental and maxillofacial histories [^116xhF5K] [^112dEiLC].

> But wait, what if the presentation includes ulcerations or excoriations in an area of anesthesia. Trigeminal trophic syndrome follows trigeminal injury and combines numbness with self-inflicted ulceration, especially around the ala nasi; I should recognize this pattern early and emphasize protective strategies and symptom control to limit tissue loss [^117KyTTz] [^114dTRJa].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions with trigeminal neuralgia when pain is absent. Classical trigeminal neuralgia is a paroxysmal, lancinating pain syndrome with neurovascular compression, whereas prominent numbness or sensory deficits raise concern for secondary causes such as demyelination or tumor; if pain features are present, carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine are first line, but pure numbness alone should steer me toward an alternative workup rather than labeling it as TN [^111rm8nZ] [^113tor51] [^112b9EK7] [^114Fusdq].

> I will now consider central nervous system etiologies. Multiple sclerosis commonly presents with facial paresthesias from brainstem demyelination and may be isolated initially; I should screen for other demyelinating features such as optic neuritis or internuclear ophthalmoplegia and image the brain with contrast to evaluate the pons and root entry zone of CN V [^111V3QnX]. Abrupt onset facial sensory loss with vertigo, ataxia, or crossed findings suggests a brainstem ischemic event, necessitating urgent stroke evaluation since posterior fossa strokes can present with predominantly sensory signs in lateral medullary or pontine territories [^111DtbwD] [^112dEiLC].

> Next, I should review systemic and metabolic contributors. Diabetes, B12 deficiency, CKD, paraproteinemia, and toxins can produce cranial sensory neuropathies superimposed on distal symmetric polyneuropathy, although DSP typically starts in the feet; targeted labs for glycemia, B12, TSH, and serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation are prudent, and I should also think about Sjögren-related sensory neuronopathy which can affect trigeminal ganglia with non–length-dependent, patchy sensory loss [^112Y2F6Y] [^1168MNPu] [^1125LZFX] [^1135NNL6]. Infectious triggers include varicella zoster with or without rash and post-viral neuritis; given reports linking COVID-19 to cranial neuropathies, I need to keep contemporaneous infection in mind while excluding other serious etiologies first [^1132mkzF].

> I need to ensure neoplastic processes are not missed. Trigeminal schwannomas, meningiomas, and skull base metastases may cause progressive unilateral facial numbness before other signs; MRI with contrast targeted to the posterior fossa, Meckel's cave, and skull base is indicated when symptoms are progressive, focal, or accompanied by other cranial neuropathies [^116qFQZM] [^112b9EK7]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially wondered whether a parotid tumor could compress V3 to cause numbness, but I should correct that: parotid lesions classically affect the facial nerve causing weakness, whereas V3 is more often compromised by masticator space or skull base lesions rather than parotid pathology, so I should adjust the anatomic differential accordingly [^115373bV] [^112dEiLC].

> I should double-check toxic and iatrogenic causes. Nitrous oxide exposure can precipitate a B12-related myeloneuropathy with paresthesias that may include facial involvement, and certain chemotherapies (taxanes, platinum agents) can cause sensory neuropathy; querying exposures is therefore necessary and reversible factors should be corrected promptly [^115V8cUT] [^112Y2F6Y].

> Next, I should review red flags that mandate urgent action. Sudden onset with posterior fossa symptoms, progressive focal deficits, multiple cranial neuropathies, constitutional symptoms, or nonhealing facial ulcerations all warrant expedited imaging and workup; I must also consider zoster ophthalmicus urgently when V1 is involved due to corneal risk and re-examine for evolving neurologic signs over time [^111DtbwD] [^117KyTTz] [^112dEiLC].

> I will now outline a practical diagnostic approach. Map sensory loss carefully to V1–V3 and document pain qualities, triggers, and tempo; obtain MRI brain with and without contrast including the trigeminal root entry zone, cisternal segment, Meckel's cave, and skull base when symptoms are focal, progressive, or atypical; order screening labs for diabetes, B12 deficiency, thyroid dysfunction, paraproteinemia, and consider SSA/SSB if neuronopathy is suspected; reserve neurophysiology or trigeminal reflex testing for unresolved cases and escalate to CSF and additional imaging when demyelinating or inflammatory etiologies are suspected [^112b9EK7] [^1168MNPu] [^116qFQZM].

> For management, I need to tailor therapy to etiology while treating reversible contributors. Idiopathic trigeminal sensory neuropathy often warrants conservative management with observation and neuropathic symptom control, as many cases stabilize or improve; when MRI shows transient enhancement mimicking a small neuroma, serial imaging can prevent unnecessary surgery, and agents like amitriptyline or gabapentinoids may reduce dysesthesias if present [^112pCcyx] [^1172ECY1] [^1165dmH8]. If coexisting trigeminal neuralgia–type pain emerges, carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine are first line, with procedural options if refractory; for TTS, education, barrier methods, and paresthesia control are core interventions; for systemic neuropathies, optimize glycemic control, replace B12, stop nitrous oxide or neurotoxic agents, and treat autoimmune or infectious drivers where identified; for functional presentations, clear explanation and rehabilitative-psychological strategies are indicated rather than escalation of invasive testing once a positive diagnosis is established [^111rm8nZ] [^113tor51] [^117KyTTz] [^112Y2F6Y] [^115V8cUT] [^116rkmgW] [^111ZqMw4].

> Let me reconsider follow-up and prognosis. Because trigeminal numbness can occasionally herald autoimmune disease or malignancy, especially if progressive, I should arrange interval clinical reassessment and repeat imaging when initial studies are unrevealing but symptoms evolve, balancing vigilance with avoidance of unnecessary procedures; conversely, a stable or improving idiopathic presentation often has a benign course under watchful waiting [^116qFQZM] [^112pCcyx].

> Finally, I need to ensure patient safety instructions are explicit. Patients should seek urgent care for new facial weakness, diplopia, severe headache, vertigo, ataxia, or sudden neurologic worsening given concern for posterior circulation events; they should also report new ulcers or ocular symptoms in V1 territory promptly to prevent complications while the diagnostic evaluation proceeds [^111DtbwD] [^117KyTTz].

Facial numbness and tingling without weakness most often reflect **trigeminal nerve or ganglion pathology** [^112KCyFM] (e.g. idiopathic trigeminal neuropathy [^112pCcyx], post-traumatic or post-dental injury [^113WjR1D], herpes zoster [^112dEiLC], or trigeminal neuralgia [^111rm8nZ]). Central causes include **multiple sclerosis** (often with other brainstem signs) [^111V3QnX] and brainstem lesions (e.g. infarct, tumor, AVM) [^111DtbwD]. Other considerations are sensory-predominant polyneuropathies (e.g. diabetes, B12 deficiency) [^112Y2F6Y], functional neurological disorder [^116rkmgW], and rare entities such as trigeminal trophic syndrome [^117KyTTz] or sensory neuronopathy [^1125LZFX]. Evaluate with focused history, exam, and MRI brain with trigeminal protocol [^112b9EK7]; add labs (CBC, CMP, B12, TSH, HbA1c) [^112Y2F6Y] and consider CSF or electrodiagnostics if indicated [^1168MNPu].

---

## Peripheral trigeminal nerve disorders

- **Idiopathic trigeminal sensory neuropathy**: Isolated sensory disturbance in one or more trigeminal divisions [^112KCyFM], often benign and self-limited [^112pCcyx].

- **Post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathy**: Follows facial trauma, dental procedures, or surgery [^116xhF5K]; numbness/tingling in the affected trigeminal distribution [^113WjR1D].

- **Herpes zoster (shingles)**: Reactivation in trigeminal ganglion causes numbness/tingling, often with vesicular rash [^112dEiLC]; postherpetic neuralgia may persist.

- **Trigeminal neuralgia**: Classically paroxysmal pain [^111rm8nZ], but some have continuous sensory symptoms; consider if sensory changes are trigeminally distributed [^114Fusdq].

---

## Central nervous system disorders

Within the central nervous system, **multiple sclerosis (MS)** causes demyelination of trigeminal pathways and may produce facial numbness or tingling, often with other brainstem signs [^111V3QnX]. Brainstem **lesions**, including infarct, tumor, or AVM affecting trigeminal pathways, may also cause isolated facial sensory symptoms [^111DtbwD].

---

## Systemic and metabolic conditions

Among systemic and metabolic conditions, **sensory-predominant polyneuropathies** — including those due to diabetes, B12 deficiency, and other metabolic causes [^1135NNL6] — rarely present with facial sensory symptoms [^112Y2F6Y]. Sensory **neuronopathies**, characterized by primary degeneration of sensory neurons (e.g. paraneoplastic, autoimmune), may also involve facial sensation [^1125LZFX].

---

## Functional neurological disorder (FND)

In functional neurological disorder (FND) [^116rkmgW], **functional sensory symptoms** may present as facial numbness or tingling without weakness, often with internal inconsistency and variability [^112f4a8L].

---

## Rare conditions

Among rare conditions, **trigeminal trophic syndrome** [^112TdfDG] is characterized by numbness and self-inflicted ulceration after trigeminal injury [^117KyTTz], while **idiopathic trigeminal neuropathy with transient MRI abnormalities** shows transient trigeminal nerve enlargement/enhancement that resolves spontaneously [^1172ECY1].

---

## Diagnostic approach

- **History and examination**: Onset, duration, triggers, associated symptoms, and detailed cranial nerve exam [^112dEiLC].

- **Imaging**: MRI brain with trigeminal protocol to exclude structural lesions, MS, or tumors [^112b9EK7].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, CMP, B12, TSH, HbA1c [^112Y2F6Y]; consider CSF or electrodiagnostics if indicated [^1168MNPu].

---

In sum, **most cases stem from trigeminal pathology**, but screen for central causes and systemic contributors; tailor imaging and labs to the history and exam.

### Numbness over the distribution of trigeminal nerve — trigeminal trophic syndrome or viral neuritis: a diagnostic dilemma [^112TdfDG]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Numbness and ulceration of the face, particularly erosion of the ala of the nose, sometimes occur after sensory denervation in the territory of the divisions of the trigeminal nerve. The incidence is uncertain and usually follows surgical treatments for trigeminal neuralgia. Such a condition is known as trigeminal trophic syndrome (TTS), although some authors believe it to be a special form of dermatitis artefacta. Trigeminal trophic syndrome most commonly affects adults after iatrogenic, vascular, viral, or neoplastic damage to the trigeminal nerve. We present a rare case of TTS in a 32-year-old woman who was referred to us with progressive numbness in the right upper and lower lip region.

### A study of the clinical characteristics of benign trigeminal sensory neuropathy [^112pCcyx]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics of a series of patients presenting with benign trigeminal sensory neuropathy.

- **Patients and methods**: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the clinical and pathologic characteristics of 23 patients presenting with facial numbness of unknown etiology.

- **Results**: Patients presented with diverse medical histories but could be grouped into those with a connective tissue disorder, neurologic disease, psychological problems, or a medical history of unknown significance. The age of the patient, the severity and distribution of the trigeminal neuropathy, and symptoms other than neuropathy closely reflected the patient's medical history. The majority of patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging, but the results did not facilitate the diagnosis of the condition or reflect the extent and severity of the symptoms. In 60% of patients, the symptoms remained unchanged during the course of the study and the outcome was not influenced by medical treatment.

- **Conclusions**: The diagnosis and management of benign trigeminal sensory neuropathy remain a significant clinical challenge.

### Trigeminal neuralgia [^111rm8nZ]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2024). High credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a facial pain disorder characterized by intense and paroxysmal pain that profoundly affects quality of life and presents complex challenges in diagnosis and treatment. TN can be categorized as classical, secondary, and idiopathic. Epidemiological studies show variable incidence rates and an increased prevalence in women and the elderly, with familial cases suggesting genetic factors.

The pathophysiology of TN is multifactorial and involves genetic predisposition, anatomical changes, and neurophysiological factors. This leads to hyperexcitable neuronal states, central sensitization, and widespread neural plasticity changes. Neurovascular compression of the trigeminal root, which undergoes major morphological changes, and focal demyelination of primary trigeminal afferents are key aetiological factors in TN. Structural and functional brain imaging studies in patients with TN demonstrate abnormalities in brain regions responsible for pain modulation and emotional processing of pain.

Treatment of TN involves a multifaceted approach that considers patient-specific factors, including the type of TN. Initial pharmacotherapy is followed by surgical options if necessary. First-line pharmacological treatments include carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine. Surgical interventions, including microvascular decompression and percutaneous neuroablative procedures, can be considered at an early stage if pharmacotherapy is not sufficient for pain control or has intolerable adverse effects or contraindications.

Intracerebral hemorrhage can be associated with various factors and symptoms. These associations can be categorized as follows:

- **Symptoms and physical signs**: Facial weakness, headache, sudden one-sided arm or leg weakness or numbness, Cheyne-Stokes breathing, papilledema, vomiting, anisocoria, focal neurologic deficits.
- **Genetic and medical factors**: Diabetes mellitus, APOE ε2/ε4 genotype, moyamoya disease, bleeding tendency, dyslipidemia.
- **Medication use**: Use of anticoagulants, use of antiplatelets.
- **Lifestyle factors**: Cigarette smoking.

Additional associations include:

- **Neurological and systemic symptoms**: Facial numbness, vertigo, seizures, nausea, acute or recurrent ataxia, loss of consciousness, sudden vision loss, syncope, altered mental status.
- **Medical conditions and predispositions**: Increased intracranial pressure, hypertension, cerebral venous thrombosis, cerebral arteriovenous malformations, intracranial aneurysm, amyloid angiopathy, brain tumor.
- **Demographic factors**: African-American race, Asian ethnicity.
- **Trauma and other factors**: Head trauma.

### Distal symmetric polyneuropathy: A review [^112Y2F6Y]. JAMA (2015). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on distal symmetric polyneuropathy:

- **Definition**: Distal symmetric polyneuropathy is a diffuse, length-dependent peripheral neuropathy characterized by numbness, tingling, pain, and/or weakness that typically starts in the toes and spreads proximally.

- **Pathophysiology**: Distal symmetric polyneuropathy is most commonly caused by diabetes (32–53%) and idiopathic reasons (24–27%). Other causes include alcohol, vitamin B12 deficiency, chemotherapy, chronic kidney disease (CKD), paraproteinemia, and inherited conditions like hammertoes, high arches, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Additional causes encompass pre-diabetes, infections, inflammation, toxins, autoimmunity, neoplasms, and paraneoplasms.

- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include numbness, tingling, and pain starting in the toes with proximal spread. Patients may exhibit decreased pinprick and vibration sensation in a stocking-glove distribution, decreased reflexes starting at the ankles, weakness of toe extension, or difficulty walking on heels. Progression may lead to weakness, involvement of fingertips, and balance issues resulting in falls and fractures. There is also a risk of ulcerations and amputations.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Lower extremity amputations are associated with early postoperative mortality of up to 22%.

### Sensory neuronopathies [^1125LZFX]. Muscle & Nerve (2016). Low credibility.

The sensory neuronopathies, or ganglionopathies, form a small subcategory of neuropathies characterized by primary degeneration of the dorsal root ganglia and trigeminal ganglion sensory neurons, resulting in a distinctive clinical presentation. Patients typically experience subacute onset of asymmetric, non-length-dependent sensory impairment and early ataxia. The etiologies of acquired sensory neuronopathies are rather limited. Early identification is imperative, as they may signal an underlying malignancy or an autoimmune condition such as Sjögren syndrome. This review addresses the various causes of acquired sensory neuronopathies, the recommended diagnostic approach, and treatment options. Finally, a select few hereditary and degenerative sensory neuronopathies, which, in contrast to the acquired disorders, are slowly progressive and are usually associated with additional neurological symptoms, will be briefly discussed.

### Chronic granulomatous neuritis in idiopathic trigeminal sensory neuropathy. Report of two cases [^112KCyFM]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2002). Low credibility.

Idiopathic trigeminal sensory neuropathy is a clinically benign disorder characterized by facial numbness confined to the territory of one or more divisions of the trigeminal nerve. This disorder can persist for a few weeks to several years, and no underlying disease can be identified. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings may occasionally be consistent with a small trigeminal neuroma of the left gasserian ganglion associated with idiopathic trigeminal sensory neuropathy. The authors report on two patients who were treated using a skull base approach, in which the gasserian ganglion was exposed and the lesion removed. The pathological diagnosis was chronic granulomatous neuritis.

The authors conclude that, in patients with MR findings suggestive of a small trigeminal neuroma, benign idiopathic trigeminal sensory neuropathy should also be considered in the differential diagnosis. A conservative approach featuring sequential MR imaging studies may help avoid unnecessary surgical exploration.

### Trigeminal trophic syndrome: A systematic review [^117KyTTz]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2024). High credibility.

The objectives of this study were to systematically report and document Trigeminal Trophic Syndrome (TTS), characterize its clinical presentation and diagnostic tests, outline management strategies and outcomes, and highlight the role of otolaryngologists in the tissue diagnosis of this rare syndrome.

- **Data sources**: PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Cochrane databases were utilized.

- **Review methods**: These databases were systematically reviewed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to identify all cases of TTS published with an English translation from inception to December 2020.

- **Results**: A total of 142 articles describing 214 patients with TTS were included in the analysis. The study indicated a female predominance (62.9%) with a median age of 57 (range 1–93) years at presentation. A trigeminal neurological insult was identified in 200 (93.5%) cases. The most common triggers for TTS were treatment for trigeminal neuralgia (35.7%) and cerebrovascular accident (21.6%). Self-inflicted trauma occurred in 137 (64%) patients. Biopsies were conducted in 123 (57.5%) patients. Patient education, barrier devices, and medications to address paresthesias were the most common treatment strategies. The majority of patients (72.5%) received multimodal therapy. Surgery was performed in 35 (22.7%) patients. Treatment outcomes were discussed in 120 (56.1%) patients.

- **Conclusions**: TTS is a rare condition with poorly understood pathophysiology. It should be suspected in a patient with non-healing facial ulceration and altered sensation.

### Multiple sclerosis prevalence in the United States commercially insured population [^111V3QnX]. Neurology (2016). High credibility.

Multiple sclerosis is a disease that can be associated with a wide range of symptoms. These include paresthesia, central vein sign, and optic neuritis. It is often observed more in females and can manifest as T1 black holes and is linked to vitamin D deficiency. Patients may experience facial numbness, diplopia, and muscle weakness, as well as decreased visual acuity and cognitive impairment. Other symptoms include relative afferent pupillary defect and muscle spasms. Transverse myelitis, limb weakness, and tingling sensations are common, alongside tobacco use-related symptoms such as hypoesthesia and painful eye movements. Notable signs of the disease can include Charcot's neurologic triad and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

- **Less common symptoms**: Fecal incontinence, tremor, gait disturbance, ependymal "dot-dash" sign, and type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).
- **Neurological signs and symptoms**: Ataxia, sleeping disorders, vertigo, fatigue, vision loss, positive Uhthoff's phenomenon, dysarthria, and eye pain.
- **Sensory and cognitive symptoms**: Dysesthesia, color vision impairment, restless legs syndrome, oscillopsia, and speech disturbance.
- **Other associated symptoms**: Neck stiffness, open ring sign, facial pain, binocular diplopia, facial hypoesthesia, and depression.

Additionally, multiple sclerosis can lead to nystagmus, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, dysphagia, psoriasis, Dawson's fingers, positive Lhermitte's phenomenon, low sex drive, urinary incontinence, and obesity. Physical strength can be affected, leading to symptoms like limb paresis and hemiparesis. Visual disturbances are also frequently reported.

### History of facial pain diagnosis [^112GYqxD]. Cephalalgia (2017). Low credibility.

There are other causes of TN. Wartenberg had previously pointed out that several cases can be associated with tumours, yet all have classical features of TN. Subsequently, it has been noted that posterior fossa meningiomas or neuromas are found in about 2% of cases presenting with a typical TN. When tumours are located more peripherally, they are likely to be associated with sensory disturbances. Multiple sclerosis is associated with TN and is seen in 2–4% of patients with MS. It can even be the first sign of MS, and some of these patients have bilateral pain.

In 1988, the first classification and diagnostic criteria for headache disorders, cranial neuralgias, and facial pain were published by the International Headache Society. This classification has subsequently been revised. In the third beta version from 2013, TN is now divided into three classes: classical TN with morphological changes in the trigeminal root by a vessel, secondary TN, where the neuralgia is secondary to an identifiable neurological disease, and idiopathic TN where the etiology is unknown.

### European Academy of Neurology guideline on trigeminal neuralgia [^112arnRo]. European Journal of Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding non-pharmacologic interventions for trigeminal neuralgia, specifically concerning psychological support, the EAN 2019 guidelines recommend offering psychological and nursing support to patients with trigeminal neuralgia. It is also advised to refer patients to national support groups when available.

### Management of functional neurological disorder [^111ZqMw4]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Diagnostic explanation and these basic management steps can often be an effective treatment. They can also prevent unnecessary and potentially harmful further investigations and treatments. A systematic review exploring the impact of receiving a diagnosis of functional seizures found that approximately half of patients had a reduction or cessation of attacks, although considerable heterogeneity exists between studies. However, diagnostic explanation alone frequently does not yield resolution of symptoms. In a systematic review assessing the prognosis of functional motor symptoms, a majority of included studies (20 of 24) found that greater than one-third of patients had ongoing symptoms at follow-up, with the severity being the same or worse. Thus, for many people with FND it is necessary to consider symptom-specific management strategies and to arrange follow-up, which allows for the monitoring of symptoms, the ability to review old notes and test results, and the opportunity for further diagnostic explanation and discussion.

### Trigeminal neuralgia: New classification and diagnostic grading for practice and research [^115Mikbc]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

- **Diagnostic grading system for TN**: The minimum requirements for possible trigeminal neuralgia (TN) are pain distribution within the facial or intraoral territory of the trigeminal nerve and a paroxysmal character of pain. It is essential that the examining physician verifies the pain does not extend to the posterior third of the scalp, the back of the ear, or the angle of the mandible, as these territories are innervated by cervical nerves. The territory of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve reaches to the cranium; thus, a patient with TN in the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve may describe pain both in the lower lip and the temple. If the neuralgia involves two trigeminal divisions, they should be contiguous, with a combination of the maxillary and mandibular divisions being most frequent.

- **Secondary indications and progression**: TN in the ophthalmic division or the tongue tends to be considered an indication of TN secondary to a major neurologic disease, although this interpretation has not been adequately scrutinized. It is also important to note that both the affected division of the trigeminal nerve and the side of the face may change over the course of the disease. TN is typically a unilateral condition. Few patients develop TN on both sides of the face over the course of the disease, such as in multiple sclerosis, but they virtually never present with simultaneous bilateral pain. The pain strictly follows the distribution of the trigeminal nerve branches.

### Conversion disorder: A systematic review of current terminology [^114WYvVa]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

The objective of this review was to address the contention that the label given to unexplained neurological symptoms significantly affects their acceptance, which has led to recent debates about renaming conversion disorder. Numerous studies have explored both layperson and clinician preferences, and this article aimed to consolidate these findings.

The design involved searching multiple databases using terms such as "conversion disorder" and "terminology" to extract relative preferences for the terms.

In the results, seven articles were identified that examined clinician and layperson preferences for terminology used for unexplained neurological symptoms. Most neurologists preferred terms like "functional" and "psychogenic", while laypeople found "functional" acceptable but considered "psychogenic" to be more offensive. The term "non-epileptic/organic" was relatively well-received by both groups.

The conclusions highlighted that "functional" is a relatively popular term with both clinicians and the public. It also satisfies more of the proposed criteria for an acceptable label compared to other popular terms. However, the perspectives of psychiatrists and patients with the disorder were not considered.

### Mechanisms and management of diabetic painful distal symmetrical polyneuropathy [^115C5CGt]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Diagnosing and assessing the severity of DSPN and painful DSPN:

A broad spectrum of presentations may occur in patients with DSPN, ranging from patients experiencing severe painful symptoms with few signs, to those presenting with a foot ulcer after losing all sensation, without having experienced any painful or uncomfortable symptoms. When questioned, such patients may describe their feet as feeling somewhat "numb" or "dead". It is well recognized that the severity of symptoms may not correlate with the severity of the deficit observed during clinical examination.

Diagnosing and assessing severity of DSPN:

The American Diabetes Association Consensus Statement recommends that the diagnosis of painful DSPN in clinical practice should be clinical, relying on the patient's description of pain and typical features of peripheral neuropathy, which include a reduction of sensory modalities and absence or reduction of ankle and knee reflexes. As DSPN is a diagnosis of exclusion, a detailed clinical history and a peripheral neurological and vascular examination of the lower limbs are essential to exclude other causes of neuropathic pain and leg or foot pain, such as peripheral vascular disease, arthritis, malignancy, alcohol abuse, and spinal canal stenosis. Nerve conduction studies are rarely helpful in clinical practice but might aid in excluding other causes of pain, such as entrapment syndromes. Patients exhibiting asymmetrical symptoms or signs, rapid progression of symptoms, or predominance of motor symptoms and signs should be carefully assessed.

### The rate of occult lesion diagnosis in a large Bell's palsy cohort [^115373bV]. The Laryngoscope (2024). Low credibility.

Bell's palsy is a debilitating disorder characterized by facial nerve weakness and is diagnosed in approximately 40,000 individuals in the United States annually. It typically presents as rapid-onset unilateral facial palsy that recovers over several weeks to months. As a diagnosis of exclusion, Bell's palsy is believed to be caused by idiopathic reactivation of a latent herpes simplex virus within the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve.

The differential diagnosis of facial palsy is broad, which can make accurate diagnosis during the initial assessment difficult. Facial palsy is most commonly caused by Bell's palsy, followed by trauma, infection, neoplasms, neurologic diseases, or stroke. Notably, occult lesions, especially parotid gland neoplasms, cranial nerve schwannomas, and cholesteatomas, can cause peripheral facial palsy similar to Bell's palsy by impinging on cranial nerve VII. In the absence of visible or palpable masses, otologic or neurologic deficits, or a history of malignancy, Bell's palsy is the most likely diagnosis. Patients are often treated with oral corticosteroids and antiviral medications and reassured that spontaneous recovery is likely.

Patients who fail to recover or who have a fluctuating course of facial palsy may require multiple referrals before an occult lesion diagnosis is revealed. Although the importance of distinguishing Bell's palsy from occult lesions across different clinical sites has been reviewed in the literature, the actual rate of misdiagnosis of lesions in Bell's palsy is not well-established, and existing studies are limited by small cohorts.

### Clinical reasoning: A 61-year-old man with progressive right leg numbness and weakness [^111WRb8K]. Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Approaching patients with lumbosacral plexopathies or radiculoplexus neuropathies can be challenging, and a well-defined strategy considering specific etiologies is necessary to arrive at the correct diagnosis. In this case, a 61-year-old man presented with a 10-year history of slowly progressive right lower extremity numbness and weakness. His examination was marked by right lower extremity weakness, decreased temperature/pinprick and proprioceptive/vibratory sensations, hypotonia, muscle atrophy, and absent right patellar and ankle deep tendon reflexes. His workup was notable for electrodiagnostic findings of chronic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy and neuroimaging revealing marked enlargement, T2 signal abnormality, and faint contrast enhancement in multiple nerves. A targeted fascicular nerve biopsy yielded the final diagnosis of a rare disease. This case highlights the differential diagnoses of lumbosacral plexopathies or radiculoplexus neuropathies, including a guided workup.

### Idiopathic trigeminal sensory neuropathy in childhood [^115R44sa]. Journal of Child Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Harris first reported transient idiopathic trigeminal sensory neuropathy in 1935, although it later appeared that, in some of his patients, this condition evolved to typical chronic and painful trigeminal neuralgia. The patients who were later described by Hill and Hughes suffered a combined motor-sensory Vth cranial nerve dysfunction, and most cases reported by Spillane and Wells developed sustained permanent trigeminal neuropathy. The largest reported series of pure trigeminal sensory neuropathy includes 10 adults with varying degrees of sensory disturbance confined to all three nerve divisions. These patients experienced no facial pain or motor deficit, and 5 (50%) recovered completely within a few months. It is estimated that typical trigeminal neuralgia occurs in about 1 in 25,000 of the population and is uncommon prior to the third decade, with 1% of the cases occurring before the age of 20 years. To our knowledge, we present the first clinical report of idiopathic trigeminal sensory neuropathy occurring in childhood.

### Comparison of stereotactic radiosurgery and rhizotomy for trigeminal neuralgia: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1148KW3p]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Low credibility.

Ten studies involving 982 patients (436 treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and 546 with rhizotomy) were analyzed. SRS significantly reduced the risk of facial numbness compared to rhizotomy, with a relative risk (RR) of 0.61 (95% CI = 0.37 to 0.99, p < 0.05; Fig. 7). There was no significant difference between multiple sclerosis (MS) groups (RR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.28 to 0.52, I² = 25.4%) and non-MS groups (RR = 2.20, 95% CI = 0.36 to 13.38, I² = 83.5, p = 0.12).

Initially, there was high variation between studies (I² = 72.2%, p < 0.0001), which decreased after removing two outlier studies ("Han, 2010" and "Altamirano, 2023"), resulting in a stronger effect (RR = 0.48, p < 0.0001, I² = 42.4%). No publication bias was detected (p = 0.27). A higher percentage of female patients was associated with a lower risk of facial numbness in the SRS group (p < 0.01), while age had a borderline effect (p = 0.09). The impact of the treatment type was notable yet not clearly defined (p < 0.01). The study "Ferraro 2019" had a high risk of bias, but removing it from this analysis did not lead to any significant changes in the overall effect.

### Advances in diagnosis and management of distal sensory polyneuropathies [^1135NNL6]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Distal sensory polyneuropathy (DSP) is characterized by length-dependent, sensory-predominant symptoms and signs, including potentially disabling symmetric chronic pain, tingling, and poor balance. Some patients also have or develop dysautonomia or motor involvement depending on whether large myelinated or small fibers are predominantly affected. Although highly prevalent, diagnosis and management can be challenging.

While classic diabetes and toxic causes are well-recognized, there are increasingly diverse associations, including with dysimmune, rheumatological, and neurodegenerative conditions. Approximately half of cases are initially considered idiopathic despite thorough evaluation, but often, the causes emerge later as new symptoms develop or testing advances, for instance with genetic approaches.

Improving and standardizing DSP metrics, as already accomplished for motor neuropathies, would permit in-clinic longitudinal tracking of natural history and treatment responses. Standardizing phenotyping could advance research and facilitate trials of potential therapies, which lag so far. This review updates on recent advances and summarizes evidence for specific treatments.

### Neuropathic pain: An updated grading system for research and clinical practice [^113o7Wmo]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

- **A history of relevant neurological lesion or disease**: There should be a clinical suspicion of a relevant lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system (e.g. an episode of acute herpes zoster or a traumatic nerve injury). The temporal relationship between the lesion or disease and the pain may vary, but a close temporal relationship helps strengthen the clinical suspicion. The onset of pain is usually immediate or within a few weeks of the lesion or disease but may be delayed for up to several months after injury (e.g. after stroke) or for many years in conditions with an insidious onset, such as diabetic neuropathy. In some cases, the history of pain or sensory disturbances by themselves suggests a disease, e.g. in polyneuropathy (peripheral neuropathy), where the insidious onset of distal pain or numbness may be the only history indicating the disease. Characteristic sudden short-lasting (usually a few seconds) paroxysmal pain in the face, which may recur several times and may be separated by a refractory period (usually some minutes), suggests trigeminal neuralgia, where the pain is the only symptom indicating a relevant neurological disease.

- **Pain distribution neuroanatomically plausible**: The pain distribution should be anatomically consistent with the suspected location of the lesion or disease in the peripheral or central somatosensory nervous system (as derived from the patient's history). This can be difficult to decipher in the single patient, as the distribution of pain can occupy a smaller area or extend somewhat outside the innervation territory.

### AAN-EFNS guidelines on trigeminal neuralgia management [^112b9EK7]. European Journal of Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Several issues regarding the diagnosis, pharmacological treatment, and surgical treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (TN) remain unsettled. The American Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Neurological Societies launched a joint task force to prepare general guidelines for the management of this condition. After a systematic review of the literature, the task force developed a series of evidence-based recommendations.

In patients with TN, MRI may be considered to identify structural causes. The presence of trigeminal sensory deficits, bilateral involvement, and abnormal trigeminal reflexes should be considered useful in disclosing symptomatic TN, whereas younger age of onset, involvement of the first division, unresponsiveness to treatment, and abnormal trigeminal evoked potentials are not useful in distinguishing symptomatic from classic TN.

Carbamazepine (stronger evidence) or oxcarbazepine (better tolerability) should be offered as first-line treatments for pain control. For patients with TN refractory to medical therapy, early surgical therapy may be considered. Gasserian ganglion percutaneous techniques, gamma knife, and microvascular decompression may be considered. Microvascular decompression might be preferred over other surgical techniques to provide the longest duration of pain freedom. The role of surgery versus pharmacotherapy in the management of TN in patients with multiple sclerosis remains uncertain.

### Neurocutaneous disease: Neurocutaneous dysesthesias [^114dTRJa]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Dysesthesia is a generic term for a cutaneous symptom — such as pruritus, burning, tingling, stinging, anesthesia, hypoesthesia, tickling, crawling, cold sensation, or even pain — without a primary cutaneous condition in a well-defined location that is often caused by nerve trauma, impingement, or irritation. There are multiple types of dysesthesias depending on the body location and the nerves involved. While location, exact symptoms, and etiologies might vary, the underlying theme is that these conditions are of neurologic origin and have dermatologic consequences.

For many of these conditions, the symptoms are localized to the skin, and patients frequently present to the dermatologist; it is important for dermatologists to be knowledgeable about these symptoms and their underlying causes. In part II of this continuing medical education review, the primary diagnoses associated with underlying cutaneous dysesthesias will be explored, including scalp dysesthesia, trigeminal trophic syndrome, meralgia paresthetica, notalgia paresthetica, and brachioradial pruritus. The typical demographics in terms of symptoms, location, and patient populations will be discussed in addition to the specific etiologies, workups, and possible treatment options.

### Functional neurological disorder: New subtypes and shared mechanisms [^1171oKAY]. The Lancet Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Functional neurological disorder is common in neurological practice. A new approach to the positive diagnosis of this disorder focuses on recognizable patterns of genuinely experienced symptoms and signs that show variability within the same task and between different tasks over time. Psychological stressors are common risk factors for functional neurological disorder but are often absent.

- **Functional seizures, functional movement disorders, persistent perceptual postural dizziness, and functional cognitive disorder**: These show similarities in etiology and pathophysiology and are variants of a disorder at the interface between neurology and psychiatry. All four entities have distinctive features and can be diagnosed with the support of clinical neurophysiological studies and other biomarkers.

The pathophysiology of functional neurological disorder includes overactivity of the limbic system, the development of an internal symptom model as part of a predictive coding framework, and dysfunction of brain networks that gives movement the sense of voluntariness. Evidence supports tailored multidisciplinary treatment that can involve physical and psychological therapy approaches.

### Diagnosis and management of Guillain-Barré syndrome in ten steps [^1138rkon]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

The diagnostic criteria for Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) were developed by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and subsequently modified in a review paper. We have added some features that cast doubt on the diagnosis, which were not mentioned in the original criteria, and made adaptations to improve readability. These criteria are not applicable to some specific variants of GBS.

- **Features required for diagnosis**: Progressive bilateral weakness of arms and legs (initially, only legs may be involved); absent or decreased tendon reflexes in affected limbs (at some point in the clinical course).

- **Features that strongly support diagnosis**: Progressive phase lasts from days to 4 weeks; marked, persistent asymmetry of weakness; bladder or bowel dysfunction at onset or persistent during disease course.

### Neuropathic orofacial pain: Facts and fiction [^116xhF5K]. Cephalalgia (2017). Low credibility.

This review deals with neuropathic pain of traumatic origin affecting the trigeminal nerve, also known as painful post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathy (PTTN).

- **Symptomatology**: The clinical characteristics of PTTN vary considerably, partly due to the type and extent of injury. Symptoms involve a combination of spontaneous and evoked pain, along with positive and negative somatosensory signs. Patients with PTTN are at risk of undergoing unnecessary dental or surgical procedures in an attempt to eradicate the cause of the pain. This risk exists because most dentists rarely encounter PTTN.

- **Epidemiology**: Overall, approximately 3% of patients with trigeminal nerve injuries develop PTTN. These patients are most often females above the age of 45 years, with both physical and psychological comorbidities being common.

- **Pathophysiology**: PTTN shares many pathophysiological mechanisms with other peripheral neuropathic pain conditions.

- **Diagnostic considerations**: PTTN may be confused with regional neuralgias or other orofacial pain conditions. For intraoral PTTN, early stages are often misdiagnosed as odontogenic pain.

- **Pain management**: The management of PTTN generally follows recommendations for peripheral neuropathic pain.

- **Expert opinion**: International consensus on classification and taxonomy is urgently needed to advance the field related to this condition.

### Trigeminal neuralgia: New classification and diagnostic grading for practice and research [^114Fusdq]. Neurology (2016). High credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) exemplifies neuropathic facial pain. However, formally classifying TN as neuropathic pain is complicated by the International Association for the Study of Pain's grading system, which requires objective signs confirming an underlying lesion or disease of the somatosensory system. The latest version of the International Classification of Headache Disorders exacerbated these difficulties by abandoning the term symptomatic TN for manifestations caused by major neurologic diseases, such as tumors or multiple sclerosis. These challenges hinder the triage of TN patients for therapy and clinical trials and complicate the development of treatment guidelines.

In response to these shortcomings, we have developed a TN classification aligned with the nosology of other neurologic disorders and neuropathic pain. We propose three diagnostic categories:

- **Classical TN**: Requires demonstration of morphologic changes in the trigeminal nerve root caused by vascular compression.
- **Secondary TN**: Caused by an identifiable underlying neurologic disease.
- **Idiopathic TN**: TN of unknown etiology.

Diagnostic certainty is graded as possible when pain paroxysms occur in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve branches. Triggered paroxysms allow for the designation of clinically established TN and probable neuropathic pain. Imaging and neurophysiologic tests that establish the etiology of classical or secondary TN determine definite neuropathic pain.

### The etiology of Bell's palsy: a review [^111PPGVi]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Bell's palsy (BP), named after the Scottish anatomist Sir Charles Bell, is the most frequent diagnosis linked to facial nerve palsy/paralysis and is also the most common acute mono-neuropathy. It affects individuals across multiple ages and both sexes, with an annual incidence ranging from 11.5 to 53.3 per 100,000 persons in various populations. Typically, BP results in partial or complete inability to automatically move the affected side of the facial muscles. Although it usually resolves within weeks or months, BP facial paresis/paralysis may lead to severe temporary oral insufficiency and an incapability to close the eyelids in some cases, resulting in potentially permanent eye injury. In approximately 25% of patients with BP, moderate-to-severe facial asymmetry may persist, frequently impairing patients' quality of life. These are among BP's long-term adverse consequences, which can be devastating for patients.

Despite its severe effects, the exact etiology of BP remains unclear. The Guideline Development Group (GDG) has identified the diagnosis of BP as one of exclusion, requiring careful clinical elimination of other potential etiologies of facial paralysis/paresis, such as trauma, neoplasms, congenital or syndromic problems, postsurgical facial paralysis/paresis, or infection by agents including zoster and Lyme disease. The GDG has also recognized the "acute" or "rapid onset" nature of BP and noted that the occurrence of paralysis/paresis usually reaches its maximum severity rapidly.

### Evaluation and management of the dysesthetic patient [^114caW1R]. Clinics in Dermatology (2023). Low credibility.

Dysesthesia is a symptomatology that includes sensations such as pain, burning, crawling, biting, numbness, piercing, pulling, cold, shock-like sensations, wetness, and heat. These sensations can cause significant emotional distress and functional impairment in affected individuals. Although some cases of dysesthesia are secondary to organic etiologies, most cases exist without an identifiable infectious, inflammatory, autoimmune, metabolic, or neoplastic process.

Ongoing vigilance is required for continual or evolving processes, including paraneoplastic presentations. Elusive etiologies, unclear treatment regimens, and stigma leave patients and clinicians with a difficult path forward, marked by "doctor shopping", lack of treatment, and significant psychosocial distress. We address this symptomatology and the psychosocial burden that often accompanies it. Although notoriously labeled as "difficult to treat", dysesthetic patients can be effectively managed, making life-changing relief possible for patients.

### Brainstem trigeminal fiber microstructural abnormalities are associated with treatment response across subtypes of trigeminal neuralgia [^111omfAt]. Pain (2021). Low credibility.

- **Classification of treatment response**: Clinical follow-up data were retrospectively reviewed to classify each patient as a responder or nonresponder to neurosurgical treatment. The primary outcome measure of pain intensity was assessed using two scales: (1) the Numerical Rating Scale (0: no pain; 10: worst possible pain) and (2) the Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) scale (I: no trigeminal pain, no medication; II: occasional pain, no medication; III: some pain, adequately controlled with medication; IV: some pain, not adequately controlled with medication; and V: severe pain, no pain relief).

	- Patients were classified as responders if they reported a reduction of ≥ 75% in pain intensity and a BNI score of I to III for ≥ 12 months after treatment. Patients were classified as nonresponders if they did not meet the above criteria, such as < 75% reduction in pain intensity within 12 months and a BNI score of IV or V, or if they had undergone multiple, repeat treatments (i.e. ≥ 3 surgeries) because of inadequate pain relief. These benchmarks of successful neurosurgical response have been repeatedly used in TN research.

	- Other clinical characteristics, including age of onset of TN, pain duration, pain laterality (right-sided or left-sided pain), and pain distribution (V1–3), were also collected for each patient at the pretreatment time point.

### Outcome measurement in functional neurological disorder: A systematic review and recommendations [^112f4a8L]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

Functional neurological disorder (FND or conversion disorder) is defined by motor and sensory symptoms (e.g. tremor, dystonia, limb weakness, numbness, and seizures) that demonstrate clinical features incompatible with other neurological/medical diagnoses and are associated with significant distress and functional impairment. Until recently, there were few controlled treatment trials and little research effort into outcome measurement in FND. However, there has been a marked increase in the number and quality of intervention studies, making it critical to optimize outcome measures for this population. This will facilitate comparison of the effectiveness and efficacy of different treatment modalities for specific FND symptoms.

FND has features that make decisions regarding outcome measurement particularly complex. These include the heterogeneity and variability of symptoms and the marked influence of attention, beliefs, and expectations. Discrepancy between objective measures and patients' subjective experiences of symptoms can also be a prominent feature. These aspects of FND potentially make objective "snapshot" measures (e.g. clinician-rated scales and objective performance tests) less reliable and valid. They also suggest that patient-rated outcomes may be particularly meaningful in this population.

A wide range of additional physical symptoms (e.g. fatigue, pain, sleep disturbance, gastrointestinal and urological problems) are common in people with FND, typically associated with reduced quality of life and greater disability. More generally, elevated physical symptomatology is prevalent.

### Longitudinal extensive transverse myelitis: A rare neurological complication of systemic lupus erythematosus [^1122Wc2a]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

We present a 47-year-old woman with recently diagnosed systemic lupus erythematosus who developed progressive numbness and tingling of her upper and lower extremities, followed by weakness and difficulty ambulating. She was diagnosed with longitudinal extensive transverse myelitis involving her entire cervical and thoracic spinal cord. An infectious workup was unrevealing. She failed to respond to pulse-dose intravenous steroids but slowly improved with the addition of plasmapheresis and cyclophosphamide. Following maintenance treatment with mycophenolate mofetil and slow tapering of oral steroids, she has maintained complete remission with significant recovery of neurological function.

This includes prior overlooked conditions, such as malignancy, and complications of acute COVID-19, like thromboembolic events, myopericarditis, and encephalitis, before diagnosing long COVID in symptomatic patients. Evaluation for other conditions should be guided by symptoms, signs, and tests obtained at the physician's discretion.

### Neuropathic pain: an updated grading system for research and clinical practice [^116fwXnE]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

- **Flow chart of updated grading system for neuropathic pain**: History, including pain descriptors, the presence of nonpainful sensory symptoms, and aggravating and alleviating factors, suggests that pain is related to a neurological lesion rather than other causes such as inflammation or non-neural tissue damage. The suspected lesion or disease is reported to be associated with neuropathic pain, including a temporal and spatial relationship representative of the condition. This includes paroxysmal pain in trigeminal neuralgia.

- **Pain distribution consistent with suspected lesion or disease**: The area of sensory changes may extend beyond, be within, or overlap with the area of pain. Sensory loss is generally required, but touch-evoked or thermal allodynia may be the only finding at bedside examination. Trigger phenomena in trigeminal neuralgia may be counted as sensory signs. In some cases, sensory signs may be difficult to demonstrate; however, if the nature of the lesion or disease is confirmed, the level "probable" continues to be appropriate if a diagnostic test confirms the lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system.

- **Definition of "definite" neuropathic pain**: The term "definite" in this context means "probable neuropathic pain with confirmatory tests" because the location and nature of the lesion or disease have been confirmed which can explain the pain. "Definite" neuropathic pain is fully compatible with neuropathic pain but does not necessarily establish causality.

Acute worsening of chronic weakness and numbness presents diagnostic challenges when distinguishing between acquired and hereditary conditions. We present the case of a 19-year-old patient with acute worsening of chronic symmetric sensory and motor neuropathy, showing no response to intravenous immunoglobulin. Her case highlights the diagnostic approach for patients with atypical features of acquired versus genetic neuropathies and the importance of interpreting a "pathogenic" gene variant in this clinical context. Readers will explore the diagnostic steps our team considered to reach the final diagnosis and the management of patients with complex neuropathy.

### Idiopathic trigeminal neuropathies: A presentation of 15 cases [^1165dmH8]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

The aim of this study is to present a clinical series of patients with trigeminal neuropathy and their treatment. We present a retrospective study of 15 cases of idiopathic trigeminal neuropathies, with unilateral involvement of one or more divisions of the trigeminal nerve. The clinical, radiologic, and laboratory data of the patients, in addition to the treatment and clinical evolution, were reviewed. The patients were followed up for a mean of 34.4 months (range: 12–120 months).

The study consisted of 11 women and 4 men. The numbness was predominantly located in the innervated mental area and extended in some cases to the first and second trigeminal divisions. Seven patients had slight continuous discomfort in association with the numbness, one of whom had bouts of typical neurogenic pain. Of the 15 cases, 8 (53%) had acute idiopathic trigeminal neuropathies and fully recovered within 3 months, while 7 (47%) were chronic cases without full recovery after 3 months. Mild pain was felt by 57% of the chronic patients and 37% of the acute patients; treatment with amitriptyline achieved complete or partial improvement in over half of these patients.

In conclusion, of the idiopathic trigeminal neuropathies, half were acute and half were chronic. Mild pain presented more frequently in the chronic patients and was relieved with amitriptyline.

### Clinical reasoning: A young woman with rapidly progressive weakness and paresthesia [^115rqLrG]. Neurology (2023). Low credibility.

A 24-year-old Middle Eastern woman presented with a two-month history of rapidly progressive asymmetric weakness and paresthesia that began in her left lower extremity and progressed to involve both legs and arms. It was associated with overflow urinary incontinence and significant weight loss. Additionally, she complained of a constant occipital headache that worsened in the supine position and was associated with photophobia, tinnitus, nausea, vomiting, and horizontal binocular diplopia. She also had signs of meningismus, decreased left facial sensation, and right sensorineural hearing loss. Because multifocal localization suggests a wide variety of possible differential diagnoses, this study expands on the differential diagnosis of a subacute multifocal process while highlighting the importance of identifying appropriate risk factors and performing a relevant yet focused diagnostic workup.

### Painful trigeminal neuropathy associated with anti-Plexin D1 antibody [^1124wxTZ]. Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Painful trigeminal neuropathy (PTN) presents with facial pain that coincides with the distribution of the trigeminal nerves (TNs). PTN develops in a variety of underlying conditions, but its pathomechanism is frequently undetermined. The International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition (ICHD-3) defines such cases with unknown mechanisms as idiopathic PTN (IPTN).

We recently reported anti-Plexin D1 antibody (Plexin D1-immunoglobulin G [IgG]) in the sera of 10% of patients with limb and trunk neuropathic pain (NP). Plexin D1-IgG binds to and exerts cytotoxic effects against isolectin B4 (IB4)-positive pain-conducting small unmyelinated dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. NP was improved in all Plexin D1-IgG–positive cases treated with plasma exchange. NP occasionally manifests as facial pain; therefore, we assessed whether Plexin D1-IgG exists in patients with IPTN and determined whether Plexin D1-IgG binds to trigeminal ganglion (TG) neurons.

### Isolated unilateral upper alveolar numbness in silent sinus syndrome [^114CeFhL]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Our case presented with left upper alveolar numbness and facial asymmetry against the background of an incidental finding of left maxillary sinusitis. The differential diagnoses made based on these clinical findings include pathologies of isolated maxillary sinusitis. Inflammatory and infective etiologies such as chronic sinusitis, odontogenic maxillary sinusitis, osteomyelitis, and chronic maxillary atelectasis/silent sinus syndrome (CMA/SSS) were considered. Idiopathic, iatrogenic, and traumatic causes of SSS were also included, while neoplastic maxillary lesions, both primary and secondary, were to be excluded.

Our consideration for differential diagnoses also encompassed non-sinusitis-related causes of both congenital and acquired etiologies. These include maxillary hypoplasia, metabolic bone disease, previous surgery or radiation, and trauma.

### Differential diagnosis of facial pain and guidelines for management [^112dEiLC]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2013). High credibility.

Facial pain can have various causes, including infraorbital nerve dehiscence, trigeminal causalgia, and temporomandibular joint disorders. Other potential causes are dental issues such as toothache, oral ulceration, and dental sepsis. Viral infections such as Bell's palsy and varicella zoster virus infection may also result in facial pain, as can conditions like eosinophilic sialadenitis and sialolithiasis.

Facial pain may also be linked to neurological and sinus-related disorders, including trigeminal neuralgia, atypical odontalgia, maxillary sinus carcinoma, olfactory esthesioneuroblastoma, and acute sinusitis. Other disorders include acute parotitis, temporal arteritis, and granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Aneurysms of the posterior communicating artery or the internal carotid artery, paroxysmal extreme pain disorder, Eagle's syndrome, and cluster headaches are additional potential causes.

Moreover, certain medications, such as moxifloxacin, can induce facial pain. Proper diagnosis and management guidelines are essential in addressing the multifaceted nature of facial pain.

### A new classification for facial pain [^114DJ4zT]. Neurosurgery (2003). Low credibility.

A patient-oriented classification scheme for facial pains commonly encountered in neurosurgical practice is proposed. This classification is driven principally by the patient's history. The scheme incorporates descriptions for so-called "atypical" trigeminal neuralgias and facial pains but minimizes pejorative terminology. It accepts that the physiology of neuropathic pains can reasonably encompass a variety of pain sensations, both episodic and constant.

- **Seven diagnostic labels**:
	- Trigeminal neuralgia Types 1 and 2 refer to patients with spontaneous onset of facial pain, with either predominant episodic or constant pain, respectively.
	- Trigeminal neuropathic pain results from unintentional injury to the trigeminal nerve due to trauma or surgery.
	- Trigeminal deafferentation pain results from intentional injury to the nerve by peripheral nerve ablation, gangliolysis, or rhizotomy, aimed at treating trigeminal neuralgia or other facial pain.
	- Postherpetic neuralgia follows a cutaneous herpes zoster outbreak (shingles) in the trigeminal distribution.
	- Symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia results from multiple sclerosis.
	- Atypical facial pain is synonymous with facial pain secondary to a somatoform pain disorder. It can be suspected but not diagnosed by history alone and requires detailed and objective psychological testing for diagnosis.

This diagnostic classification would allow more rigorous and objective natural history and outcome studies of facial pain in the future.

### Prognostic factors, symptom evolution, and quality of life of posttraumatic trigeminal neuropathy [^113WjR1D]. Pain (2022). Low credibility.

Risk factors for CPSP are well-established and include both patient-related and surgery-related factors. At the time of writing, there is limited evidence regarding the presentation and outcome of patients with posttraumatic trigeminal neuropathies (PTTNs), and potential prognostic predictors have not been thoroughly investigated. Likely predictors for chronification can be identified in the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative periods and cover six broad domains: genetic, demographic, psychosocial, pain, clinical, and surgical factors. Most studies have focused on the preoperative risk factors of trigeminal neurosensory disturbances (NSDs). The identification of these risk factors is important because they may allow the phenotyping of patients in the future. This phenotyping is crucial if we wish to improve treatment outcomes. As yet, there have been no large longitudinal studies investigating the outcomes of posttraumatic trigeminal nerve injuries. Furthermore, prognostic prediction models are lacking.

The aim of this study was to identify prognostic factors in patients with PTTNs by running a multivariable analysis based on the retrospective longitudinal data of a large patient cohort from a tertiary referral center in Belgium (University Hospitals Leuven) and to build a prognostic prediction model using these data. We aimed to determine if and when NSDs persist and how symptoms evolve over time. In addition, we aimed to predict quality of life (QoL) and compare clinical features, pain quality, and characteristics between low and high pain intensity cohorts.

### Stroke mimic in an acute rehabilitation unit patient with associated hypomagnesaemia [^113CYyWV]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

This case report describes a patient who presented with acute left facial numbness and eyelid weakness, prompting further work-up, which demonstrated low suspicion for a new stroke but revealed hypomagnesaemia as a potential differential diagnosis. The patient initially presented to the emergency department with left upper extremity weakness and was diagnosed with right basal ganglia infarction. Two weeks after being transferred to the acute rehabilitation unit, the patient suddenly complained of left facial numbness and eyelid weakness. However, brain imaging did not show any new acute infarct. Instead, laboratory results showed hypomagnesaemia at 1.50 mg/dL. The patient was therefore treated with intravenous magnesium, leading to the resolution of his symptoms.

Up to 30% of acute stroke presentations are stroke mimics. Although hypomagnesaemia is less frequently seen as a mimic, its neuromuscular manifestations may present with similar symptoms. Patients will always benefit from a comprehensive evaluation for stroke symptoms, but it is important to consider the mimics as well.

### Isolated facial diplegia in Guillain-Barré syndrome: Bifacial weakness with paresthesias [^112oMxjq]. Muscle & Nerve (2015). Low credibility.

Bifacial weakness with paresthesias (BFP) is a subtype of Guillain-Barré syndrome characterized by rapidly progressive bilateral facial weakness, occurring without other cranial neuropathies, ataxia, or limb weakness. Many patients report distal limb paresthesias and exhibit diminished or absent deep tendon reflexes. BFP, a localized form of Guillain-Barré syndrome, is believed to be exclusively caused by demyelinating-type neuropathy, rather than axonal-type neuropathy. Notably, patients with BFP do not display anti-ganglioside IgG antibodies. Due to its rarity, many physicians are not familiar with BFP, as bilateral facial weakness is more frequently associated with conditions like sarcoidosis, Lyme disease, or meningeal pathology. Some patients diagnosed with bilateral Bell palsy may actually have BFP. This review highlights the clinical features of BFP and outlines diagnostic criteria.

Neurological examination revealed right facial numbness along the V2 distribution and flaccidity in her lower extremities, with a motor power of 0/5 throughout. The T4 sensory level and bilaterally positive Babinski sign were noted. Brain MRI revealed multiple bilateral T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintense lesions with central enhancement involving the right trigeminal nerve. Full spine MRI demonstrated long-segment thoracic cord demyelination extending from T1 to T11 and nerve root enhancement. An extensive workup for infectious and autoimmune aetiologies was conducted, revealing a positive Covid-19 result. The patient was diagnosed with encephalomyeloradiculitis secondary to Covid-19 infection. Encephalomyeloradiculitis is a rare neurological condition associated with various underlying conditions. Understanding the causes and differentiating these conditions is essential for appropriate treatment.

### The misdiagnosis of functional disorders as other neurological conditions [^1164K81L]. Journal of Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

Several studies have shown that when patients with functional neurological disorders are followed up, it is rare to find another neurological condition that better explains the initial symptoms in hindsight. No study has examined the reverse, studying patients with a range of neurological disease diagnoses with the aim of assessing how often a new diagnosis of functional disorder better explains the original symptoms.

- **Methods**: A prospective multi-centre cohort study of 2,637 new neurology outpatient referrals from primary care in Scotland was conducted. Neurologists provided initial diagnoses and a rating of the extent to which their symptoms were explained by an 'organic' neurological disease. Patients were followed up 19 months later with a questionnaire sent to their primary care physician asking about diagnostic changes and, when indicated, also involving discussions with the original assessing neurologist and review of secondary care records.

- **Results**: Valid responses were obtained for 2,378 out of 2,637 patients (90%) with symptoms 'largely' or 'completely' explained by organic disease at baseline. At follow-up, we found diagnostic errors in 48 patients. Of those, ten (0.4%) had a functional diagnosis, and 38 patients (1.6%) had a different 'organic' diagnosis which better explained the original symptoms.

- **Conclusions**: Patients diagnosed with neurological disease sometimes have a functional diagnosis at follow-up, which, with hindsight, better explains the original symptoms. This occurs at a frequency similar to the misdiagnosis of 'organic' neurological disease as a functional disorder.

### Numbness matters: A clinical review of trigeminal neuropathy [^116qFQZM]. Cephalalgia (2011). Low credibility.

Trigeminal neuropathies are a group of clinical disorders that involve injury to primary first-order neurons within the trigeminal nerve. We review the spectrum of etiologies underlying both painful and non-painful trigeminal neuropathies, with attention to particularly dangerous processes that may elude the clinician in the absence of a meticulous evaluation. Complications and management issues specific to patients with trigeminal neuropathy are discussed.

- **Methods**: Retrospective literature review.

- **Results**: Facial or intraoral numbness, the hallmark of trigeminal neuropathy, may represent the earliest symptomology of malignancy or autoimmune connective tissue disease as sensory neurons are destroyed. Such numbness, especially if progressive, necessitates periodic evaluation and vigilance even years after presentation if no diagnosis can be made.

- **Conclusions**: In the routine evaluation of patients with facial pain, the clinician will inevitably be confronted with secondary pathology of the trigeminal nerves and nuclei. The appearance of numbness, even when pain continues to be the most pressing complaint, necessitates clinical assessment of the integrity of all aspects of the trigeminal pathways, which may also include neurophysiologic, radiographic, and laboratory evaluation.

### Facial pain: Clinical differential diagnosis [^114NxbaW]. The Lancet Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Differential diagnosis of pain in the face as the presenting complaint can be difficult. We propose an approach based on history and neurological examination, which allows a working diagnosis to be made at the bedside, including aetiological hypotheses leading to a choice of investigations. Neuralgias are characterized by stabs of short-lasting, lancinating pain, and although neuralgias are often primary, imaging may be needed to exclude symptomatic forms. Facial pain with cranial nerve symptoms and signs is almost exclusively of secondary origin and requires urgent examination. Facial pain with focal autonomic signs is mostly primary and belongs to the group of the idiopathic trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, but can occasionally be secondary. Pure facial pain is most often due to sinusitis and the chewing apparatus, but also a multitude of other causes. The pain can also be idiopathic. Imaging, as well as non-neurological specialist assessment, is often necessary in these cases.

### A young man with numbness in arms and legs: From the National Multiple Sclerosis Society case conference proceedings [^111iHanP]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

This patient's symptom onset and evolution were both subacute. The differential of a partial myelopathy includes structural (compressive), inflammatory, metabolic, toxic, infectious, paraneoplastic, vascular (especially spinal dural arteriovenous fistula), and malignant causes. Genetic/inherited causes usually present more insidiously. In acute cases of myelopathy where inflammation of the spinal cord is demonstrated by imaging or in CSF, but no more specific etiology is found, the label idiopathic acute transverse myelitis may be applied, typically reaching nadir in 4–21 days. This case presented as a subacute partial myelitis.

A key clinical feature of this patient's presentation is the relative lack of early major clinical deficits despite such an extensive longitudinal spinal cord lesion, which favors neurosarcoidosis. This differs from neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) pathophysiology, which typically causes extensive tissue destruction all along the lesion and profound early deficits. While LETM is exceptionally uncommon in MS, it is highly characteristic of NMOSD and can be associated with other inflammatory myelitides, particularly with neurosarcoidosis. Dorsal subpial post-gadolinium enhancement is characteristic of neurosarcoidosis myelitis when compared to NMOSD, whereas the ring configuration of enhancement is highly reminiscent of the inflammatory pattern most commonly affiliated with those diagnostic entities under the rubric of NMOSD. The "trident sign" describes central canal enhancement with dorsal subpial enhancement.

### Covid-19-associated bifacial weakness with paresthesia subtype of Guillain-Barré syndrome [^116uumyM]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2020). Low credibility.

We report a case of bifacial weakness with paresthesia, a recognized Guillain-Barré syndrome subtype characterized by rapidly progressive facial weakness and paresthesia without ataxia or other cranial neuropathies, which was temporally associated with antecedent coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). This case highlights a potentially novel but critically important neurologic association with the COVID-19 disease process. Herein, we detail the clinicoradiologic work-up and diagnosis, clinical course, and multidisciplinary medical management of this patient with COVID-19. This case is illustrative of the increasingly recognized but potentially underreported neurologic manifestations of COVID-19, which must be considered and further investigated in this pandemic disease.

### Diagnosis and management of functional neurological disorder [^116rkmgW]. BMJ (2022). Low credibility.

Functional neurological disorder (FND), previously regarded as a diagnosis of exclusion, is now a rule-in diagnosis with available treatments. This represents a major step toward destigmatizing the disorder, which was often doubted and deemed untreatable. FND is prevalent, generally affecting young and middle-aged adults, and can cause severe disability in some individuals. An early diagnosis with subsequent access to evidence-based rehabilitative and/or psychological treatments can promote recovery — albeit not all patients respond to currently available treatments.

This review presents the latest advances in the use of validated rule-in examination signs to guide diagnosis, and the range of therapeutic approaches available to care for patients with FND. The article focuses on the two most frequently identified subtypes of FND: motor (weakness and/or movement disorders) and seizure-type symptoms. Twenty-two studies on motor and 27 studies on seizure-type symptoms report high specificities of clinical signs (64–100%), and individual signs are reviewed. Rehabilitative interventions (physical and occupational therapy) are treatments of choice for functional motor symptoms, while psychotherapy is an emerging evidence-based treatment across FND subtypes. The literature at the time of writing highlights heterogeneity in responses to treatment, underscoring that more research is needed to individualize treatments and develop novel interventions.

### Peripheral neuropathy: Evaluation and differential diagnosis [^1168MNPu]. American Family Physician (2020). Low credibility.

Peripheral neuropathy, a common neurologic problem encountered by family physicians, can be classified clinically by the anatomic pattern of presenting symptoms and, if indicated, by results of electrodiagnostic studies for axonal and demyelinating disease. The prevalence of peripheral neuropathy in the general population ranges from 1% to 7%, with higher rates among those older than 50 years. Common identifiable causes include diabetes mellitus, nerve compression or injury, alcohol use, toxin exposure, hereditary diseases, and nutritional deficiencies. Peripheral neuropathy is idiopathic in 25% to 46% of cases. Diagnosis requires a comprehensive history, physical examination, and judicious laboratory testing.

Early peripheral neuropathy may present as sensory alterations that are often progressive, including sensory loss, numbness, pain, or burning sensations in a "stocking and glove" distribution of the extremities. Later stages may involve proximal numbness, distal weakness, or atrophy. Physical examination should include a comprehensive neurologic and musculoskeletal evaluation. If the peripheral nervous system is identified as the likely source of the patient's symptoms, evaluation for potential underlying etiologies should initially focus on treatable causes. Initial laboratory evaluation includes a complete blood count; a comprehensive metabolic profile; fasting blood glucose, vitamin B12, and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels; and serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation. If the initial evaluation is inconclusive, referral to a neurologist for additional testing may be necessary.

### Management of Bell's palsy [^113HC6M5]. Australian Prescriber (2017). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Bell's palsy:

- **Definition**: Bell's palsy, also known as idiopathic facial paralysis, is an acute-onset, isolated, unilateral, lower motor neuron facial weakness or paralysis.

- **Pathophysiology**: The exact cause of Bell's palsy is unknown; however, reactivation of the herpes virus at the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve has been postulated.

- **Disease course**: The likely vascular distension, inflammation, and edema with ischemia of the facial nerve results in Bell's palsy. It presents with clinical manifestations of unilateral weakness or paralysis of upper and lower facial muscles, drooping of ipsilateral eyelids, dry eye due to inability to close eyes completely, epiphora, drooping of the corner of the mouth, ipsilateral impaired or loss of taste sensation, difficulty in eating, dribbling of saliva, altered sensation on the affected side of the face, pain in or behind the ear, and hyperacusis on the affected side if the stapedius muscle is involved. Spontaneous complete recovery occurs in 70–75% of untreated patients.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Bell's palsy is not associated with an increased risk of mortality.

### Facial nerve grading system [^1115ynSS]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (1985). High credibility.

The House-Brackmann Facial Paralysis Scale is a clinical tool used to assess the severity of facial nerve dysfunction, specifically in patients with facial paralysis. This scale is widely used in the evaluation of patients with Bell's palsy, Ramsay Hunt syndrome, or other conditions causing facial nerve paralysis. The clinical utility of this scale lies in its ability to provide a standardized method for assessing the degree of facial nerve damage, which can guide treatment decisions and allow for consistent tracking of patient progress over time.

- **Grading system**: The House-Brackmann scale grades facial function from I (normal) to VI (total paralysis), taking into account parameters such as symmetry at rest, voluntary movement, and synkinesis (involuntary movement).

- **Utility and limitations**: There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the House-Brackmann scale, but it may be less accurate in patients with partial facial nerve palsy or in those with dynamic facial asymmetry due to causes other than facial nerve dysfunction.

The scale assigns a grade from 1 to 6, which corresponds to varying levels of facial movement and symmetry. For example:

- "Normal facial function in all areas" results in "Grade 1: Normal", indicating no noticeable issues with facial movement.
- "Slight weakness on close inspection" is reflected as "Grade 2: Slight asymmetry" with specific characteristics like minor asymmetry visible at the mouth.

This predictive grading is essential for determining the appropriate clinical pathway and for evaluating therapeutic outcomes.

### Diagnosis and management of Guillain-Barré syndrome in ten steps [^115BENez]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

Some patients have a distinct and persistent clinical variant of Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) that does not progress to the classic pattern of sensory loss and weakness. These variants include weakness without sensory signs (pure motor variant), weakness limited to the cranial nerves (bilateral facial palsy with paraesthesias), upper limbs (pharyngeal–cervical–brachial weakness), or lower limbs (paraparetic variant). The Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS) is another variant that, in its full manifestation, consists of ophthalmoplegia, areflexia, and ataxia. In general, GBS variants are rarely 'pure' and often overlap in part with the classic syndrome or show features typical of other variant forms.

- **Pattern of symptoms in variants of Guillain–Barré syndrome**: Graphic representation of the pattern of symptoms typically observed in the different clinical variants of Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS). Symptoms can be purely motor, purely sensory (rare), or a combination of motor and sensory. Ataxia can be present in patients with Miller Fisher syndrome, and both decreased consciousness and ataxia can be present in patients with Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis. Symptoms can be localized to specific regions of the body, and the pattern of symptoms differs between variants of GBS. Although bilateral facial palsy with paraesthesias, the pure sensory variant, and Miller Fisher syndrome are included in the GBS spectrum, they do not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for GBS.

### Incidence and prevalence of functional neurological disorder: A systematic review [^115fwmQH]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2025). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: To be included in this systematic review, studies had to: (i) be original research; (ii) report on patients with FND (described as functional or psychogenic neurological symptoms/disorder, hysteria or conversion disorder, or, in the case of functional seizures, dissociative or non-epileptic) in adults and/or children; (iii) report either on the incidence or prevalence of FND, or provide data from which incidence and/or prevalence could be calculated, within a defined geographic area for which the population was known.

	- Studies in which only one FND subtype (e.g. functional seizures, functional movement disorder, functional limb weakness) were considered were included, but studies focused exclusively on functional cognitive disorder, persistent postural perceptual dizziness (PPPD), functional speech, or functional sensory disturbances (loss of vision, hearing, or tactile sensation) were not. PPPD and functional cognitive disorder were not included as these have only recently been defined as FND subtypes and in the case of the latter, diagnostic guidelines have only recently been operationalized.

	- Studies more broadly examining 'functional' or 'somatoform' disorders were included only if the data included the specific frequency of FND symptoms such as functional motor symptoms or functional seizures. The search was not limited by date of publication or study quality. Studies looking at special subpopulations only (e.g. refugees) and non-English language studies were excluded.

- **Search strategy**: A search of the PubMed database was updated to 15 August 2023.

### Rare but relevant: Nitrous oxide and peripheral neurotoxicity, what do we know [^115V8cUT]. Addiction (2025). Low credibility.

Clinical presentations in hospitals have included various neurologic symptoms following sporadic N2O use. These symptoms, such as paraesthesia, paraplegia, tingling, dizziness, numbness, and limb weakness, are collectively categorized as peripheral neuropathy. More serious symptoms, including progressive neuropathology, myelopathy, and generalized dysautonomia (GDP), can arise with repeated use. These are characterized by limb weakness, vestibular disturbances, and ultimately paralysis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can demonstrate the structural damage to the spinal cord, and the severity of GDP correlates with the reported amount of N2O used. Additionally, asphyxiation due to hypoxia has been reported, leading to several deaths in the United Kingdom (UK) and Australia; however, spinal cord degeneration was not diagnosed in any of these fatal cases.

Whereas literature on N2O's neurotoxicity initially consisted of single case reports, recent years have seen larger case series studies describing the frequency of symptoms among hospitalized patients. In a large Chinese clinical study on N2O-induced pathology, peripheral neuropathy was diagnosed in 107 out of 110 patients. Another Chinese case series study reported peripheral neuropathy as the most frequent diagnosis among 61 patients, with numbness and limb weakness as the most common symptoms. Paraesthesia was reported in 85% of cases (n = 101) in a large UK hospital study, with lower limbs most commonly affected. Finally, a study from the Royal London Hospital diagnosed subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord.

### Unusual sensory variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome [^114KZvyA]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

We describe a 52-year-old woman presenting with acute onset of severe burning paresthesia in the hands and feet, associated with allodynia and antalgic gait. At the time of admission to the hospital, no motor weakness was present. A diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) was considered when neurophysiological studies were completed, showing convincing evidence of demyelination on motor conduction studies and sural sparing on sensory nerve studies. We describe this case as a sensory variant of GBS. Clinical improvement followed treatment with a single course of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). The patient made a complete clinical recovery within six months of onset, and repeat neurophysiological studies showed marked improvement. We encourage clinicians to consider an atypical variant of GBS in patients presenting with acute sensory complaints.

### Idiopathic trigeminal neuropathy with trigeminal mass lesion on MRI: Neoplasm or not [^1172ECY1]. Cephalalgia (2010). Low credibility.

The objective of the present study was to investigate clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of idiopathic trigeminal neuropathy with transient MR abnormalities mimicking a neoplasm (ITNmn). We retrospectively evaluated clinical and MRI features in two cases of ITNmn seen in our institution in comparison with those of previously reported five cases. The most common symptom was altered facial sensation and numbness limited to one or more trigeminal nerve divisions (100%). ITNmn commonly affected not only the second and third divisions (86% and 57%, respectively) but also the first division (71%). The most common findings on MRI were enlargement and gadolinium enhancement of the trigeminal nerve, which were similar to those seen in neoplasms (100%). The abnormalities spontaneously regressed in all five evaluable cases. ITNmn should be added in the differential diagnosis of non-specific mass-like lesions in trigeminal neuropathy and be observed carefully without surgical treatment.
