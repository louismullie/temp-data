## Question

Is Calprotectin and m2-pk positivity characteristic to anything?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether fecal calprotectin and fecal M2-pyruvate kinase (M2-PK) positivity are characteristic of any specific disease, and how to interpret them clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what each biomarker actually measures and its biological basis. Then, I should verify the clinical contexts in which each is elevated and how specific those associations are. Next, I will compare their diagnostic performance and limitations. After that, I should consider how guidelines recommend using these tests in practice. Finally, I will synthesize whether there is any disease for which dual positivity is characteristic and outline practical next steps when both are elevated.

> Let me first confirm the biology and clinical meaning of calprotectin. Calprotectin is a heterodimer of S100A8 and S100A9 released by activated neutrophils and monocytes; in the gut, it reflects neutrophil migration into the lumen during mucosal inflammation and correlates with endoscopic and histologic activity, which is why it is widely used to detect intestinal inflammation in IBD and related conditions [^111eMEJn] [^112Sqojo]. Wait, let me verify the performance characteristics I'm quoting: pooled sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing IBD from non-inflammatory conditions are commonly cited around 0.88 and 0.79, respectively, with commonly used cutoffs in the 50–100 μg/g range, though optimal thresholds vary by assay and clinical question, so I should be cautious not to overstate a single cutoff as universal [^111JSZRp] [^113w4vLd].

> Now, I need to check the biological basis and clinical meaning of M2-PK. Tumor M2-PK is the dimeric isoform of pyruvate kinase expressed by rapidly dividing cells; in the gut, it is released into stool in settings of high epithelial turnover such as colorectal cancer and inflammatory mucosa, so elevations reflect increased cellular proliferation rather than neutrophil activity per se [^111bKZ8a] [^111vr62J]. Hold on, I should verify the performance claims: in IBD cohorts, fecal M2-PK correlates with calprotectin and is higher in active versus inactive disease, but its sensitivity and specificity for "organic disease" are generally lower than calprotectin, and it is not specific for IBD or cancer, which means false positives and false negatives occur and clinical context remains essential [^111bKZ8a] [^117LDkxG].

> Next, I should review the clinical contexts where calprotectin is elevated. Calprotectin rises in IBD (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), infectious colitis, microscopic colitis, diverticulitis, ischemic colitis, NSAID-associated enteropathy, and colorectal neoplasia; critically, it is not specific for any single diagnosis and must be interpreted alongside symptoms, endoscopy, and histology when needed [^1123dhDb] [^113b7duR] [^1123dhDb]. I should double-check that mild elevations can occur with medications and in children, so borderline results warrant repetition or further evaluation rather than a definitive label of disease [^113b7duR] [^112GBgCb].

> I will now examine the clinical contexts where M2-PK is elevated. M2-PK is increased in colorectal cancer, IBD (particularly when active), and can be seen with adenomas and other proliferative or inflamed mucosal states; importantly, it is not specific for cancer or IBD and can be influenced by sampling and assay factors, so a positive result is not diagnostic by itself [^114euYtR] [^111bKZ8a] [^112npNrw]. Wait, let me verify a potential pitfall: I initially thought M2-PK might be "characteristic" of cancer, but that overstates specificity; although sensitivity for CRC can approach the mid-80s in some series, specificity hovers around 79–82%, and performance is notably worse for rectal than colon cancers, reinforcing that M2-PK positivity is not pathognomonic for any single disease [^111Jeuyd] [^112kckzN].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about dual positivity. I should confirm whether any disease is uniquely defined by both calprotectin and M2-PK being positive. Both markers reflect increased mucosal turnover and inflammation rather than a disease-specific pathway; thus, dual positivity simply indicates active inflammatory and/or proliferative mucosal pathology and is not characteristic of a single diagnosis such as IBD, CRC, or infection, even though both may be elevated in those conditions [^111eMEJn] [^111bKZ8a]. Let me reconsider: if both are positive, that strengthens the probability of organic disease and should prompt endoscopic evaluation rather than a specific etiologic conclusion based on the biomarkers alone [^114Ldtnm] [^112jvQz9].

> Next, I should review how guidelines advise using these tests. For calprotectin, major societies endorse its use to differentiate inflammatory from functional disease, to monitor disease activity, and as part of treat-to-target strategies; thresholds around 50–150 μg/g are commonly used, with lower cutoffs favored to rule out inflammation and higher cutoffs to raise suspicion for active disease, while acknowledging assay variability and the need to interpret results in clinical context [^114azLfp] [^114Ldtnm] [^115vxZFw]. For M2-PK, there are no society-endorsed diagnostic algorithms; it remains investigational for routine differentiation of organic versus functional disease and is not recommended as a standalone screening test for CRC given limited specificity and the availability of better options, so I should be cautious not to overinterpret a positive M2-PK in isolation [^117LDkxG] [^111z2dMY].

> I should double-check practical implications when both are elevated. Dual elevation increases the likelihood of organic pathology and should lower the threshold for endoscopic assessment, especially if symptoms are present or calprotectin is markedly elevated; conversely, if calprotectin is normal and symptoms are mild, the probability of IBD is low and empiric treatment for IBS may be reasonable with appropriate safety netting and follow-up [^117MaRos] [^112jvQz9]. But wait, what if calprotectin is only mildly elevated? Intermediate values in the 80–250 μg/g range can reflect low-grade inflammation, medications, or sampling variability, so repeating calprotectin with the same assay and reassessing symptoms is prudent before committing to invasive testing [^1123dhDb] [^112i4Fr9] [^113Kg9s7].

> In summary, I need to ensure the conclusion is precise. Calprotectin positivity reflects neutrophil-driven intestinal inflammation and is highly sensitive but not specific for IBD, while M2-PK positivity reflects epithelial turnover and is neither sensitive nor specific enough to diagnose a single disease; dual positivity is not characteristic of any one condition but is a noninvasive signal of organic, inflammatory, and/or proliferative mucosal disease that warrants confirmatory endoscopic evaluation rather than a specific etiologic diagnosis based on biomarkers alone [^111eMEJn] [^111bKZ8a] [^117LDkxG].

---

Calprotectin and M2-PK positivity are **not specific to any single disease** but together indicate active intestinal inflammation with high cell turnover [^1123dhDb] [^111bKZ8a]. The most characteristic pattern is in **active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)** — especially Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis — where both markers are typically elevated and correlate with disease activity [^111eMEJn] [^111bKZ8a]. They can also be elevated in colorectal cancer, infectious colitis, and other inflammatory conditions, so they are **not disease-specific** [^1123dhDb] [^111Jeuyd]. Dual positivity increases the likelihood of organic disease and helps distinguish IBD from IBS, but **endoscopy is still required** for a definitive diagnosis [^117LDkxG] [^114azLfp].

---

## Biological basis of calprotectin and M2-PK

Calprotectin is a **neutrophil-derived protein** released during inflammation; fecal levels correlate with mucosal neutrophil activity and are stable in stool, making it a reliable marker of intestinal inflammation [^111eMEJn] [^1123dhDb]. M2-PK is a dimeric isoform of pyruvate kinase expressed by rapidly dividing cells, including tumor cells and activated leukocytes; fecal M2-PK reflects **increased epithelial turnover and cell death** [^111bKZ8a] [^114euYtR].

## Clinical conditions associated with calprotectin and M2-PK positivity

| **Clinical condition** | **Calprotectin positivity** | **M2-PK positivity** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) | High sensitivity and specificity for active inflammation [^113w4vLd] [^117XpvAB] | Frequently elevated, correlating with disease activity [^111bKZ8a] [^113jzRjo] | Both markers are typically elevated in active Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis [^1123dhDb] [^111bKZ8a] |
| Colorectal cancer (CRC) | Elevated in some cases, but not specific [^115yYWp5] | Frequently elevated, correlating with tumor burden and stage [^111Jeuyd] [^112T6G8V] | M2-PK is more consistently elevated in CRC than calprotectin [^notfound] |
| Infectious colitis | Elevated due to neutrophil infiltration [^111eMEJn] | Elevated due to epithelial damage and cell turnover [^notfound] | Both markers can be elevated in bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections [^113b7duR] |
| Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) | Typically normal or mildly elevated [^117MaRos] [^113w4vLd] | Typically normal or mildly elevated [^117LDkxG] | Both markers are useful in distinguishing IBS from IBD [^117LDkxG] |
| Microscopic colitis | Elevated, reflecting chronic inflammation [^112Sqojo] | Elevated in some cases, reflecting epithelial turnover [^notfound] | Both markers can be elevated, but endoscopy with biopsies is required for diagnosis [^112Sqojo] |
| Diverticular disease | Elevated in acute diverticulitis [^112Sqojo] | Elevated in some cases due to inflammation and epithelial damage [^notfound] | Both markers can be elevated in acute diverticulitis [^112Sqojo] |

## Diagnostic utility of combined calprotectin and M2-PK testing

Combined testing improves detection of organic disease compared with either marker alone, with **higher sensitivity and specificity** than either alone [^117LDkxG]. It also helps distinguish IBD from IBS, as IBS typically shows normal or mildly elevated levels of both markers [^111bKZ8a] [^117LDkxG]. In IBD, both correlate with disease activity and can aid monitoring and guide therapy adjustments [^1123dhDb] [^111bKZ8a].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

- **Non-specificity**: Both markers can be elevated in various inflammatory and neoplastic conditions, limiting their specificity [^1123dhDb] [^111bKZ8a].
- **Assay variability**: Different assays and lack of standardized cutoffs can affect results and interpretation [^113Kg9s7] [^1123dhDb].
- **Clinical context**: Results must be interpreted in clinical context, and endoscopy remains the gold standard for definitive diagnosis [^116sqycT] [^112jvQz9].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines recommend fecal calprotectin to **differentiate IBD from IBS** and to monitor disease activity in IBD [^114azLfp] [^114Ldtnm]. M2-PK is not yet widely recommended but may complement calprotectin in specific clinical scenarios [^114ZxoNe]. Endoscopic evaluation is recommended when biomarkers are elevated or clinical suspicion persists [^112jvQz9].

---

Calprotectin and M2-PK positivity are **most characteristic of active IBD**, reflecting neutrophil-driven inflammation and epithelial turnover. They are not disease-specific and can be elevated in CRC, infectious colitis, and other inflammatory conditions. Combined testing improves detection of organic disease but **does not replace endoscopy** for definitive diagnosis.

### Fecal M2-pyruvate kinase (M2-PK): a novel marker of intestinal inflammation [^111bKZ8a]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Surrogate markers of bowel inflammation are increasingly being recognized as important, not only as markers of disease activity in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) but also to differentiate irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) from IBD. The dimeric M2-isoform of pyruvate kinase (M2-PK) has been reported to be elevated in fecal specimens from colorectal cancer (CA) patients, but its role in IBD is unknown. This study investigated the usefulness of fecal M2-PK in cohorts of patients with IBD, IBS, and CA.

Methods

Stool samples were obtained for calprotectin and M2-PK measurements in patients with previously diagnosed IBD or new patients being investigated for lower gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in a UK university hospital. Other investigations were performed as directed by the investigating physician and patients with known IBD were assessed for disease activity by a physician global assessment, Harvey-Bradshaw index (HBI), or endoscopic grading.

Results

Fecal M2-PK and calprotectin measurements were obtained for 148 patients: 50 with ulcerative colitis (UC); 31 with Crohn's disease (CD), 43 with irritable bowel syndrome/functional bowel disorders (IBS); 7 with colorectal CA, and 17 with miscellaneous conditions (excluded from the analysis). Median M2-PK values (U/mL) were significantly elevated in UC: 20.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.4–69.0, P < 0.0001), CD: 24.3 (95% CI 6.4–44.0, P < 0.0001), and CA: 7.0 (95% CI 4.3–88.0, P < 0.0006) compared to IBS: 0.1 (95% CI 0.0–3.2). There was a strong linear correlation of M2-PK with calprotectin levels. A predetermined cutoff level of 3.7 U/mL for a normal M2-PK test produced a sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV) of 73%, 74%, and 89%, respectively, for organic disease. Furthermore, M2-PK levels were significantly elevated in active, compared to inactive, disease for CD (30 versus 0.55 U/mL, P < 0.005) and UC (40 versus 1.2 U/mL, P = 0.006), respectively.

Conclusions

Fecal M2-PK is elevated in IBD as well as in CA patients and is a sensitive and relatively specific marker for organic GI pathology, with a PPV of 89%. Furthermore, it appears to be a potentially valuable, noninvasive marker of disease activity in IBD.

### Fecal dimeric M2-pyruvate kinase (tumor M2-PK) in the differential diagnosis of functional and organic bowel disorders [^117LDkxG]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Fecal inflammatory markers have been shown to be useful as noninvasive screening tools to differentiate patients with functional from organic bowel pathology. Of these markers calprotectin has been the most intensively studied. More recently, the dimeric isoform of M2-pyruvate kinase (tumor M2-PK) has been suggested as a marker of gastrointestinal inflammation. The aim of this study was to investigate fecal tumor M2-PK in the differentiation of functional from organic bowel disease.

Methods

Fecal calprotectin and tumor M2-PK were measured in 94 controls and 105 gastroenterology outpatients with a possible diagnosis of organic bowel disease. The diagnosis was made by clinical, endoscopic, and radiological criteria.

Results

Organic bowel disease was diagnosed in 14 patients (13%). Median calprotectin and tumor M2-PK concentrations were 24.5 microg/g and 1 U/mL in controls, 23 microg/g and 1 U/mL in functional, and 227.5 microg/g and 12.6 U/mL in organic bowel disease. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios for diagnosis of organic bowel disease were 93%, 92%, 11.6, and 0.07 for calprotectin and 67%, 88% 5.6, and 0.18 for tumor M2-PK, respectively. Calprotectin in combination with tumor M2-PK gave a sensitivity of 64%, specificity of 98%, and likelihood ratios of 32 and 0.03. Elevated calprotectin or tumor M2-PK decreased specificity to 87%, but increased sensitivity to 100%.

Conclusions

Tumor M2-PK is able to differentiate organic from functional bowel disease but has a lower sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value than calprotectin. Further studies are required, alone or in combination with other markers, before its usefulness in this setting can be recommended.

### Faecal markers of gastrointestinal inflammation [^114jLUxo]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms including abdominal pain, bloating and diarrhoea are a relatively common reason for consulting a physician. They may be due to inflammatory bowel disease (inflammatory bowel disease; Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and indeterminate colitis), malignancy (colorectal cancer), infectious colitis or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Differentiation between these involves the use of clinical, radiological, endoscopic and serological techniques, which are invasive or involve exposure to radiation. Serological markers include C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and antibodies (perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasm antibody and anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody). Faecal markers that can aid in distinguishing inflammatory disorders from non-inflammatory conditions are non-invasive and generally acceptable to the patient. As IBS accounts for up to 50% of cases presenting to the GI clinic and is a diagnosis of exclusion (Rome III criteria), any test that can reliably distinguish IBS from organic disease could speed diagnosis and reduce endoscopy waiting times. Faecal calprotectin, lactoferrin, M2-PK and S100A12 will be reviewed.

### Faecal calprotectin, lactoferrin, M2-pyruvate kinase and S100A12 in severe ulcerative colitis: a prospective multicentre comparison of predicting outcomes and monitoring response [^113jzRjo]. Gut (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare four faecal markers for their ability to predict steroid refractoriness in severe paediatric ulcerative colitis (UC). Construct validity and responsiveness to change were also assessed.

Methods

This was a prospective multicentre cohort study. Stool samples from 101 children (13.3 + or - 3.6 years; Pediatric UC Activity Index (PUCAI) at admission 72 + or - 12 points) were obtained at the third day of intravenous steroid therapy. Repeated samples at discharge were obtained from 24 children. Predictive validity was assessed using diagnostic utility statistics to predict steroid failure (ie, the need for salvage treatment). Concurrent validity was assessed using correlational analysis with the following constructs: PUCAI, Lindgren and Seo scores, physician's global assessment, albumin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein (CRP). Responsiveness was assessed using test utility and correlational strategies.

Results

Median values (IQR) were very high at baseline for all four markers (calprotectin 4215 microg/g (2297–8808); lactoferrin 212 microg/g (114–328); M2-pyruvate kinase (M2-PK) 363 U/g (119–3104); and S100A12 469 microg/g (193–1112)). M2-PK was numerically superior to the other three markers and CRP in predicting response to corticosteroid treatment (area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 0.75 (95% CI 0.64 to 0.85; p < 0.001) vs < 0.65 for the others). However, it did not add to the predictive ability of the PUCAI (area under the ROC 0.81 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.89)). M2-PK also had the highest construct validity but with a modest mean correlation with all constructs (r = 0.3; p < 0.05). None of the markers was responsive to change (Spearman's rho correlation with change in the PUCAI < 0.1; p > 0.05, area under the ROC curve < 0.65; p > 0.05).

Conclusions

The four markers were greatly elevated in severe paediatric UC. Only M2-PK had good construct and predictive validity, and none was responsive to change. The PUCAI, a simple clinical index, performed better than the faecal markers in predicting outcome following a course of intravenous corticosteroids in severe UC.

### Accuracies of fecal calprotectin, lactoferrin, M2-pyruvate kinase, neopterin and zonulin to predict the response to infliximab in ulcerative colitis [^113XBEC4]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Fecal markers might predict the response to anti-TNFα in ulcerative colitis (UC).

Aims

To compare the performance of fecal calprotectin (fCal), lactoferrin (fLact), M2-PK (fM2-PK), neopterin (fNeo), and zonulin (fZon) to predict the response to therapy in active UC patients.

Methods

Disease activity from 31 consecutive patients with an active UC, treated with infliximab (IFX) was assessed by the Mayo score at baseline and at week 14 and by the partial Mayo score at W52 and stool samples collected for fecal marker measurements at W0, W2, and W14.

Results

At W14, 19 patients (61%) were responders to IFX induction. The median levels of fCal, fLact and fM2-PK drop dramatically from baseline to W14 in clinical responders. At W2, fM2-PK, fLact and fCal levels predicted accurately the response to IFX induction. At W14, fLact, fCal, and fM2-PK were individually reliable markers to predict sustained response at W52. The performances of fNeo and fZon were weaker in this setting.

Conclusions

The performance of fM2-PK at W2 to predict response to induction therapy with IFX was superior to that of fLact and fCal, whereas monitoring fLact was the best tool to predict adequately the course of the disease at one year under maintenance IFX in UC.

### Surrogate fecal biomarkers in inflammatory bowel disease: rivals or complementary tools of fecal calprotectin? [^114ZxoNe]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Current noninvasive methods for assessing intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remain unsatisfactory. Along with C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, fecal calprotectin (FC) is the standard test for assessing IBD activity, even though its specificity and accuracy are not optimal and it lacks a validated cutoff. Over the past few decades, several fecal markers released from intestinal inflammatory cells have been investigated in IBD; they are the subject of this systematic review.

Methods

A systematic electronic search of the English literature up to April 2017 was performed using Medline and the Cochrane Library. Only papers written in English that analyzed fecal biomarkers in IBD were included. In vitro studies, animal studies, studies on blood/serum samples, and studies analyzing FC or fecal lactoferrin alone were excluded.

Results

Out of 1023 citations, 125 eligible studies were identified. Data were grouped according to each fecal marker including S100A12, high-mobility group box 1, neopterin, polymorphonuclear neutrophil elastase, fecal hemoglobin, alpha1-antitrypsin, human neutrophil peptides, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, chitinase 3-like-1, matrix metalloproteinase 9, lysozyme, M2-pyruvate kinase, myeloperoxidase, fecal eosinophil proteins, human beta-defensin-2, and beta-glucuronidase. Some of these markers showed a high sensitivity and specificity and correlated with disease activity, response to therapy, and mucosal healing. Furthermore, they showed a potential utility in the prediction of clinical relapse.

Conclusions

Several fecal biomarkers have the potential to become useful tools complementing FC in IBD diagnosis and monitoring. However, wide variability in their accuracy in assessment of intestinal inflammation suggests the need for further studies.

### Comment on: plasma pyruvate kinase M2 as a marker of vascular inflammation in giant cell arteritis: reply [^117Fo7pW]. Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

, We thank Dr R. Watanabe and Dr M. Hashimoto for their interest in our recently published article on pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) expression in giant cell arteritis (GCA). We are happy to respond to the issues raised in their letter and to share some of our additional observations in a point-by-point reply below.

Firstly, as pointed out by the authors, plasma PKM2 levels are indeed elevated not only in active GCA but also in malignancies and infections. Thus, elevated PKM2 levels are not specific for GCA but rather reflect glycolytic inflammatory processes. Therefore, we fully agree that there is an urgent clinical need for novel diagnostic biomarkers that can differentiate between GCA and other inflammatory diseases/infections. It may well be that a combination of biomarkers is required to achieve this. Of note, at baseline, plasma PKM2 expression correlated with CRP and ESR and also with levels of macrophage products, calprotectin and YKL-40, which were previously identified by us as biomarkers in GCA. Whereas CRP and ESR levels decrease after glucocorticoid (GC) treatment, both macrophage markers remain elevated despite GC treatment, which may reflect ongoing vascular inflammation. For this reason, we performed an additional analysis of CRP, ESR, calprotectin and plasma PKM2 levels after 6 weeks and 1 year of GC treatment (Fig. 1A). We found a positive correlation between calprotectin and plasma PKM2 levels (r = 0.447, P = 0.02) after 6 weeks of treatment (Fig. 1B). There was no correlation between PKM2 and calprotectin levels after 1 year of GC treatment. This association between circulating PKM2 and calprotectin at 6 weeks may indicate that plasma PKM2 also reflects ongoing vascular inflammation in GCA patients. 1
Plasma PKM2 levels in GCA patients are associated with continuing vascular inflammation

### A combination of faecal tests for the detection of colon cancer: a new strategy for an appropriate selection of referrals to colonoscopy? A prospective multicentre Italian study [^112T6G8V]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Colonoscopy workload for endoscopy services in Western countries is increasing markedly because of the implementation of faecal occult blood-based mass screening programmes against colorectal cancer (CRC). We therefore explored the possibility of using a combination of faecal tests to prioritize the access to colonoscopy with criteria other than symptoms and/or time of referral.

Aims and Methods

We tested a combination of faecal tests [immunochemical faecal occult blood test (i-FOBT), M2-PK, calprotectin] as markers for advanced neoplasia in a selected series of patients requiring colonoscopy for the suspicion of CRC. All the tests were performed in a 1-day stool sample of patients aged 50–80 years, without any dietary restriction, before colonoscopy.

Results

A total of 280 patients' stool single samples were analysed. Forty-seven patients had CRC and 85 patients had one or more advanced adenoma(s) at colonoscopy/histology. CRCs were associated with a highly significant increase (P < 0.001) in faecal tumour M2-PK (mean 24.2 kU/l), which correlated with Dukes' staging. For CRC detection, i-FOBT was the test with the highest specificity and positive predictive value (0.89 and 0.53), whereas M2-PK had the highest sensitivity and negative predictive value (0.87 and 0.96). Calprotectin showed performance similar to M2-PK in terms of sensitivity and negative predictive value (0.93), but had lower specificity (0.39). The best combination of tests to predict the risk of CRC in this series was i-FOBT+M2-PK, as in patients showing positivity to both markers, the risk of cancer was as high as 79%.

Conclusion

The combination of i-FOBT and M2-PK is a sensitive tool in clinical practice for the appropriate management of waiting lists for colonoscopy, as it allows the classification of patients into different degrees of priority for investigation, according to their foreseeable risk of CRC.

### Faecal M2-pyruvate kinase: a novel, noninvasive marker of ileal pouch inflammation [^111vr62J]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Dimeric M2-pyruvate kinase (dM2-PK) is overexpressed in tumour cells with rapid cell turnover. Its concentrations correlate well with the staging and metastatic capability of the tumour cells. We investigated the use of faecal dM2-PK as a noninvasive marker of pouch inflammation (pouchitis) in patients having undergone restorative proctocolectomy.

Methods

Stool samples were obtained from 46 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and eight with familial adenomatous polyposis. Pouchitis was defined using the objective pouchitis score (OPS) and the pouch disease activity index. Faecal dM2-PK was measured using a quantitative sandwich-type enzyme immunoassay (ScheBo Biotech UK) and the results compared with reciprocal faecal calprotectin concentrations.

Results

Using the OPS, 6 of the 46 patients with UC had pouchitis and prepouch ileitis, 13 had UC pouchitis alone, and 27 had a non-inflamed UC pouch. One patient with familial adenomatous polyposis had pouchitis and prepouch ileitis and 7 had an non inflamed pouch. Respective median dM2-PK values (U/ml) for these five groups were 49.5 (4.5–110), 12 (1–192.3), 2.2 (0.1–95.2), 19.5 and 1 (0.1–3). Statistically significant differences were noted between inflamed and non inflamed pouches (P < 0.0001). dM2-PK correlated significantly with the OPS, pouch disease activity index, endoscopic appearances, acute histological and neutrophil scores (< 0.0001). The receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity of 80 and 70.6%, respectively. dM2-PK and faecal calprotectin concentrations correlated closely (r = 0.87, P < 0.0001).

Conclusion

This study demonstrates that faecal dM2-PK is a sensitive marker of pouch inflammation and that its concentration directly correlates with the objective markers of pouchitis severity.

### Tumour M2-PK as a stool marker for colorectal cancer: comparative analysis in a large sample of unselected older adults vs colorectal cancer patients [^114euYtR]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Apart from performance characteristics, this study was the first to determine faecal tumour M2-PK concentrations in a large sample of unselected older adults allowing investigation of potential determinants of this stool marker. The lack of association between important risk factors for CRC and increased levels of tumour M2-PK suggests that tumour M2-PK is not a marker of CRC risk, but the release of tumour M2-PK into the bowel is only increased when neoplastic lesions are already present. The observed association between current smoking status and higher levels of tumour M2-PK necessitates further examination. Given that the proportion of smokers was comparable among colon cancer patients, rectal cancer patients and ESTHER participants in our study, smoking status should not have confounded the estimates of sensitivity and specificity.

As regards more practical aspects, the analytic procedure of determining faecal tumour M2-PK is rather simple and inexpensive compared with other novel approaches, for example, DNA-based stool testing. Analyses are performed on only 4 mg of stool, and for sampling a special stick is used to capture the stool. On the one hand, this sampling modality appears to be less unpleasant than collecting a larger quantity of stool using a spatula or spoon, an aspect that may improve compliance with screening. On the other hand, given that the marker is determined quantitatively, the approach might be prone to variability owing to incorrect sampling. Considering the problem in a larger context, exact analyses might be a particular challenge of protein-based markers, where quantitative measurements are more common. In contrast, DNA-based tests predominantly provide qualitative (yes/no) answers.

### What is the faecal calprotectin test? [^111A1HPZ]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

Calprotectin is a protein released by white blood cells involved in inflammation of the bowel.1 It can be detected in faeces using laboratory or point of care tests. Although an elevated calprotectin level indicates inflammation in the bowel, it cannot identify the cause.1 Faecal calprotectin testing is mainly used in distinguishing between 'functional' disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome and 'organic' disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease, a group of conditions including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis that require referral to specialist services. Here we explain the role of faecal calprotectin testing in adults in primary care.

Introduction

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are characterized by chronic remittent episodes of inflammation in and beyond the GI tract that afflict individuals with substantial morbidity. Since the identification and characterization of calprotectin in the 1980s, fecal calprotectin emerged as a non-invasive biomarker that discriminates between inflammatory and non-inflammatory diseases of the gut and portraits the disease course of human IBD. Calprotectin is expressed as a heterodimeric protein (Mrp-8/Mrp-14 or S100A8/S100A9) in neutrophils and can reach up to 50% of the soluble protein content in the cytoplasm. During intestinal inflammation, neutrophils migrate to the intestinal mucosa and release calprotectin into the lumen of the intestine, where high calcium ion concentrations are likely to lead to the formation of a tetrameric structure. The quantity of the marker calprotectin detected in feces shows a good correlation with endoscopic and histological data and indicates the severity of IBD. In healthy adults, median levels of fecal calprotectin are 10–34 μg/g; values between 80–160 μg/g can represent a mild organic disease or inflammation, and calprotectin above 160 μg/g is highly indicative of active inflammation in the gut, wherein the values for the categorizations vary slightly in literature –. As such, the marker is broadly used in the diagnosis of IBD and to monitor disease activity, response to therapy, and disease recurrence. Calprotectin can also be elevated in blood and may be used for monitoring other inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, cystic fibrosis, acute coronary syndrome, or sepsis. Quantification of specific oligomeric states or metabolic products of calprotectin, as observed in blood, might offer additional value for the diagnosis of diseases –.

### The role of faecal calprotectin in diagnosis and staging of colorectal neoplasia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115yYWp5]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Calprotectin enters the bowel lumen by migration and is resistant to enzymatic degradation and therefore can be readily detected in bodily fluids such as faeces. Elevation of faecal calprotectin (FC) occur in a wide variety of GI conditions including colitis and malignancy and although a sensitive measure of inflammation, it is not specific for any single condition. Nonetheless, given the importance of inflammation in cancer development and progression, the presence of an elevated FC may provide additional discrimination of a patient's risk of colorectal neoplasia and progression.

The role of FC as a diagnostic test that may categorise patients by risk of neoplasia (adenomas and carcinomas) is poorly defined. Furthermore, it is not clear whether FC values show any correlation with tumour characteristics including disease stage or location. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to attempt to characterise the relationship between elevations of FC and colorectal neoplasia, in order to ascertain whether there may be any value in its routine assessment as part of the diagnostic process.

### Calprotectin: from biomarker to biological function [^1123dhDb]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Major advances over the last decade have fostered our understanding of the molecular functions of CP in mammals. Translation of biological insights by mechanistic studies of mucosal surfaces in mice to human disease is scarce, but would evolve our understanding of CP as inflammatory biomarker. Both subunits, S100A8 and S100A9, harbour a broad spectrum of intracellular and extracellular immunomodulatory properties (figure 3). However, it is still debated whether the biological function of the S100A8 subunit may be opposed to that of S100A9 in tissue inflammation and tumorigenesis. Analysis of tissue-specific knock-out mice of either subunit and/or blocking distinct binding sites will help to delineate divergent intracellular or extracellular biological functions. Considering the transcriptional regulation and biological functions of CP during inflammation, clinicians should be aware that other conditions, most commonly GI (bacterial or viral) infections, but also malignancies, drugs and graft-versus-host disease, are paralleled by increased faecal CP concentrations. Faecal CP represents an extensively validated biomarker for the diagnosis and longitudinal evaluation of IBD reflecting endoscopic disease activity reasonably well. Lack of guidelines and data regarding optimal faecal CP cut‐offs renders intermediate faecal CP concentrations of 150–250 µg/g (declared as grey zone by STRIDE-II recommendations) frequently challenging to interpret in IBD, while < 40 µg/g rules out IBD and > 250 µg/g should prompt evaluation for IBD or raise suspicion for an IBD flare (figure 2). We propose that a better understanding of the biological functions of CP and particularly the S100A8 and S100A9 subunits will lead to novel diagnostic and therapeutic advances in humans in the future.

Introduction

Inflammation describes an evolutionarily conserved process, which is characterised by the activation of innate and adaptive immune cells to protect the host against a wide range of potential threats. If such responses spiral out of control, dysregulated chronic inflammation turns into a detrimental condition underlying the pathophysiology of many human diseases. Recent advances fostered our cellular and molecular understanding of unresolved inflammation and consequently, anti-inflammatory targeted therapies, for example, for human inflammatory diseases of the skin, joints and gut have substantially changed clinical practice over the last decade. However, many inflammatory diseases are still poorly controlled, partly because the underlying disease trigger(s) remain enigmatic.

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are characterised by chronic remittent episodes of inflammation in and beyond the GI tract. Recent insights have revealed the complex nature of IBD with a genetic underpinning that cannot explain the majority of cases. In line with this, a rising incidence and prevalence worldwide suggests that Westernisation of life style (with associated dietary and microbial cues) significantly contributes to the development and natural history of IBD. Specific dietary compounds that instigate or impact the course of human IBD remain to be determined, while experimental studies in mice identified that nutritional compounds fuel gut inflammation partly by modulation of the intestinal microbiota.

To accurately diagnose IBD, the entire spectrum of available tools should be exploited, including patient history, non-invasive and invasive imaging (endoscopy) and histological interpretation. In such a diagnostic algorithm, serum and especially faecal biomarkers help to select patients for an invasive diagnostic evaluation, in that a specific threshold allows to discriminate between functional (non-inflammatory) diseases with a similar clinical presentation and an inherently high prevalence (such as irritable bowel syndrome). In IBD, but also in many other inflammatory conditions, clinicians increasingly employ calprotectin (CP) as well-studied (systemic and faecal) inflammatory biomarker due to its stability, assay reproducibility and low cost to guide diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. In contrast, the biological functions of CP in health and unresolved inflammation are poorly appreciated by most clinicians. In this review, we focus on emerging biological functions and clinical applications of CP in inflammatory diseases to facilitate interpretation in daily practice.

Coverage gaps in disease monitoring for IBD — targets and therapeutic drug monitoring — are noted: International recommendations include normalization of fecal calprotectin as a treatment target and evaluation of biologic drug levels; reaching a target fecal calprotectin level within 12 weeks of starting a new therapy predicts favorable long-term clinical outcomes; and drug concentrations and anti-drug antibodies are important for individual optimization.

Biomarker-based treat-to-target strategy and biomarker elevation magnitude — panel observations and knowledge gaps are outlined. Trials such as CALM have demonstrated that incorporating biomarker assessment as part of the treat-to-target strategy is beneficial, especially in patients with active disease, yet such trials have relied on a rigid set of prespecified criteria that would result in treatment escalation. The panel notes the need to examine various biomarker cutoff thresholds, combinations of biomarkers, the role in asymptomatic patients, and the potential harm of not dose escalating with mild abnormalities, and states there have not been any studies comparing a biomarker-based strategy with an endoscopy-based strategy for assessment and monitoring of endoscopic remission — a knowledge gap. Regarding magnitude, the panel focused on performance at commonly used cutoffs, so recommendations were based only on whether values were above the cutoff and did not factor in degree of abnormality; a single marked elevation may carry different prognostic implications, exemplified by fecal calprotectin > 2500 μg/g in individuals with mild symptoms.

Mucosal calprotectin expression indicated by brown immunohistochemical staining is visualised in lamina propria immune cells and to a lesser extent the intestinal epithelium in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), but not healthy controls (Ctrl).

Collectively, faecal CP can be used to virtually exclude a wide range of intestinal diseases characterised by gut inflammation, while it does not allow to discriminate potential triggers. As such, other causes of elevated faecal CP concentration must be ruled out prior to IBD diagnosis. Strongly elevated faecal CP concentration is frequently observed during bacterial infections. Interpretation of slightly elevated faecal CP concentrations should be made with care, as viral infections and drugs (e.g. NSAIDs, proton pump inhibitors, glucocorticoids, and levodopa) may induce S100A8 and/or S100A9 expression, and GI bleeding is associated with moderately elevated CP levels (i.e. 50–200 µg/g).

Faecal CP discriminates between inflammatory and non-inflammatory gut disease

Although faecal CP values > 600 µg/g are strongly associated with IBD (or food-borne infections), no consistent CP cut-off is established that would allow to diagnose IBD with high accuracy. Thus, clinicians rely on probabilities to rule in or to rule out IBD (or functional gut diseases) based on faecal CP concentration. The threshold of what is considered an 'elevated' faecal CP (or vice versa what is considered healthy) is still debated. As already mentioned earlier, faecal CP concentrations found in healthy individuals mainly range between ~10–50 µg/g stool, which depends on study cohorts and the used assay. A meta-analysis including 12 studies (comprising 491 healthy controls, 595 patients with IBS and 1059 patients with IBD) generally indicated that faecal CP concentrations of ≤ 40 µg/g (using sensitive assays) rule out IBD (i.e. provides ≤ 1% probability of having IBD). Several studies implicated that faecal CP allowed differentiation between non-IBD and IBD at a cut-off between 100–200 µg/g. However, an exact faecal CP cut-off value for the discrimination between IBD and functional bowel diseases is not established. Clinical decision-making to discriminate inflammatory from non-inflammatory disease with relative accuracy and the need for endoscopy is indicated in figure 2A.

### Faecal calprotectin: factors affecting levels and its potential role as a surrogate marker for risk of development of Crohn's disease [^115nqDC1]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Faecal calprotectin (FC) is one of the most widely used non-invasive tests for the diagnosis and assessment of Crohn's disease (CD) activity. Despite this, factors other than the presence of disease and disease activity that affect levels, have not been adequately reviewed. This is important particularly in the context of the use of FC in assessing the risk that a patient with symptoms may have disease.

Another potentially important issue is the question as to whether FC levels may be of use in establishing a subject's risk of developing Crohn's disease in the future. This possibility will also be further elaborated on in this review, as factors influencing levels in asymptomatic subjects may also have a bearing on this.

CD is a complex chronic disease. Over the last decade large population studies and experimental studies have helped to elucidate the aetiopathogenesis of the disease. The onset of CD is caused by an interaction of genetic susceptibility, environmental triggers and subsequent change in the intestinal microbiome causing disruption of the host immunity. As with many other diseases, the relative contribution of environment over genetic influences increases with age. With early onset CD, genetics are likely to play an important role, whereas in later onset disease the effect of the environment is likely to be more prominent.

### Faecal calprotectin: factors affecting levels and its potential role as a surrogate marker for risk of development of Crohn's disease [^111XdnZN]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

FC maybe a useful surrogate marker of developing CD as suggested by family studies. These have shown increased lifetime risk of developing CD in children whose parents have CD than the general population. Additionally non-affected family members who are known to be at increased risk, have consistently shown to have increased levels of FC; 49% of relatives but only 13% of spouses (who did not actually have CD). 5–10% of first degree relatives will go on to develop CD. Additionally, elevated FC is a well validated marker of risk of relapse in established CD in remission, which whilst is a different situation to risk of developing disease is likely to share some aetiological factors in common such as cigarette smoking.

The remainder of this review explores the environmental factors which affect FC levels in subjects without disease and argues that as well as being an excellent marker of disease activity and relapse risk, may also be a candidate surrogate marker of risk of developing CD in subjects yet to develop the disease. We will make this argument by demonstrating that many environmental exposures associated with elevated FC in healthy subjects are themselves risk factors for CD. We will begin by assessing what is known about the determinants of FC levels in healthy subjects.

### Calprotectin: from biomarker to biological function [^1112q6TQ]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

The incidence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) emerged with Westernisation of dietary habits worldwide. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic debilitating conditions that afflict individuals with substantial morbidity and challenge healthcare systems across the globe. Since identification and characterisation of calprotectin (CP) in the 1980s, faecal CP emerged as significantly validated, non-invasive biomarker that allows evaluation of gut inflammation. Faecal CP discriminates between inflammatory and non-inflammatory diseases of the gut and portraits the disease course of human IBD. Recent studies revealed insights into biological functions of the CP subunits S100A8 and S100A9 during orchestration of an inflammatory response at mucosal surfaces across organ systems. In this review, we summarise longitudinal evidence for the evolution of CP from biomarker to rheostat of mucosal inflammation and suggest an algorithm for the interpretation of faecal CP in daily clinical practice. We propose that mechanistic insights into the biological function of CP in the gut and beyond may facilitate interpretation of current assays and guide patient-tailored medical therapy in IBD, a concept warranting controlled clinical trials.

Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 4 gives an overview of changes in faecal calprotectin from baseline to the moment of reaching the target range (ΔFC ↓) and from the last result in range to the first out-of-range result (ΔFC ↑). The median ΔFC ↓ was −2095 (interquartile range, IQR −3000 to 1281) μg/g. The median ΔFC ↑ was 860 (interquartile range, IQR 557–1922) ug/g. Ninety-five percentage (72/76) of IBD patients in our cohort had FC concentrations over 500 μg/g at baseline. Eighty-eight percent (53/60) of patients had FC concentrations below 200 μg/g when the target range was reached. Similarly, in those who flared during the observation period, FC concentrations were below 200 μg/g shortly before the flare in 92% (23/25) of cases. The first out-of-range measurement was over 500 μg/g in 96% (24/25) of cases.

An implementation consideration states that lack of normalization or persistently elevated biomarkers after initial treatment likely suggests active inflammation and may warrant treatment adjustment without need for endoscopic or radiologic evaluation.

### What calprotectin cut-offs should apply for IBD in general practice? [^113mtvEK]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

It has been shown that much of the cost attributed to IBS arises from the time and resources used to establish the diagnosis and to rule out inflammatory conditions; 50%–75% of the overall costs attributable to IBS arise from the use of invasive endoscopic procedures. Like others, we argue that use of the FC test, at the manufacturer's recommended cut-off of 50 µg/g, is clinically useful and cost-effective, with little risk of an error that would pose serious risks. Indeed, previous work has shown that the routine use of calprotectin to exclude inflammatory changes results in substantial economic savings.

In summary, while we applaud the work of Dhaliwal et al, in confirming the value of FC in the clinical setting where IBD and IBS are the primary concerns, we caution that greater insight is required in the interpretation of such studies, particularly with regard to establishment of the target condition against which test performance characteristics are measured. We also reiterate that FC has high clinical utility in general practice settings to exclude IBD or other inflammatory conditions of the colon, is Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared for this indication, and is also recommended by National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines and several gastrointestinal (GI) specialty societies for this purpose.

Biomarker quantification by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA)

Nine protein biomarkers selected in our preliminary studyand comprising haemoglobin, C-reactive protein (CRP), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP1), M2-pyruvate kinase (M2-PK), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9), peptidyl arginine deiminase-4 (PADI4), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), calprotectin and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) were quantified in the collected CM samples using commercially available ELISA kits. ELISA kits for haemoglobin, CRP, TIMP1, MMP9 and EGFR were provided by Abcam (Cambridge, UK). M2-PK and PADI4 were detected using kits from MyBioSource (San Diego, CA, USA). Calprotectin was measured by kits from Calpro AS (Lysaker, Norway). Kits manufactured by MBL (Nagoya, Japan) were applied for the quantification of EDN. All ELISA assays were carried out according to the protocols provided by kit manufacturers, and calibration standards as well as quality controls supplied with the kits were used for assay calibration and examination quality testing. All standards and samples were analysed in duplicates. Sample dilutions used for obtaining optimal measurement results were as follows: M2-PK and PADI4 — no dilution; TIMP1 — 1/4; EDN — 1/5; haemoglobin and EGFR — 1/10; calprotectin — 1/50; MMP9 — 1/100; CRP — 1/250. These optimal dilutions were determined in our previous study. Assay results were quantitatively measured using Multiscan FC plate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific Oy, Vantaa, Finland), at absorbance wavelengths recommended by the ELISA kit manufacturers.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of Crohn's disease [^112i4Fr9]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

AGA practical application of biomarkers advises that application of all biomarkers in clinical practice should be guided by downstream implications, including risk of consequent treatment decisions (low-risk treatment adjustment vs high-risk treatment adjustment), and that test performance thresholds (acceptable FP and FN rates) may vary for patient–provider teams depending on the decision. Fecal calprotectin assays may not be interchangeable and the same assay should be used for a given patient to compare performance across time; stool sampling can vary with within-day variation, and when results are borderline or unexpected repeat fecal calprotectin testing or endoscopic evaluation for confirmation may be required. Because there are inter-individual differences in biomarker elevation and in a subset of patients biomarkers may correlate poorly with endoscopic activity, overall performance and confidence may be higher when biomarkers have been longitudinally observed to correlate with the patient's endoscopic disease activity during both active disease and remission.

### Practical guidance on the use of faecal calprotectin [^111RRtnL]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Differentiation between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and functional gut disorders, and the determination of mucosal disease activity in established cases of IBD remain the cornerstones of disease diagnosis and management. Non-invasive, accurate biomarkers of gut inflammation are needed due to the variability of symptoms, the inaccuracies of currently available blood markers and the cost and invasive nature of endoscopy. Numerous biomarkers have been used and/or considered with some in current use. This article reviews the current evidence base around the indications for using biomarkers and their limitations, with a particular focus on faecal calprotectin.

### Tumour M2-PK as a stool marker for colorectal cancer: comparative analysis in a large sample of unselected older adults vs colorectal cancer patients [^1125gdju]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

In the interpretation of our results, the following limitations should be kept in mind. Samples from cases and controls could not be analysed in a blinded fashion. However, this may not have a relevant impact given the highly standardised and automated performance of this test. Another limitation concerns the collection of stool samples, which was different for cases and controls. To account for potential bias from this source, we performed sensitivity analyses based on the results from stability testing. These analyses showed that performance characteristics of the test only changed slightly when potential degradation during mailing of control samples was taken into account. The consistency of our findings with performance characteristics reported previously based on smaller sample sizes further supports that the limitations of our study might not have distorted the results.

Given that previous studies on tumour M2-PK did not mention conditions of sample handling at all, the necessity of raising stability issues within our study is not only a limitation, but also a strength and allows further conclusion: Application of the test in a setting where a cold chain might be feasible would be expected to result in levels of specificity close to the corrected levels derived in this study and in levels of sensitivity close to those observed in this study. Conversely, application of the test in a setting where all stool samples are mailed without cooling would be expected to result in levels of specificity close to the uncorrected levels observed in this study and in levels of sensitivity that would be somewhat lower than observed in this study. The possibility of buffer-based stabilisation of faecal tumour-M2-PK should be explored.

In conclusion, regarding the comparatively high sensitivity of the tumour M2-PK stool test, its potential use for early detection of CRC and adenomas merits further investigation. At the current specificity, the test would result in a large proportion of follow-up colonoscopies. Possibilities to enhance specificity of the test (eg, by combination with other markers) need to be explored to make potential screening based on this test more focused and economic.

### Tumour M2-PK as a stool marker for colorectal cancer: comparative analysis in a large sample of unselected older adults vs colorectal cancer patients [^111Jeuyd]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Stool testing based on tumour-derived markers might offer a promising approach for non-invasive colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. The aim of this study was to estimate the potential of a new test for faecal tumour M2-PK to discriminate patients with CRC from a large sample of unselected older adults. Faecal tumour M2-PK concentrations were determined in 65 CRC patients and in a population-based sample of 917 older adults (median age: 65 and 62 years, respectively). Sensitivity and specificity of the test were calculated at different cutoff values, and receiver-operating characteristic curves (ROC) were constructed to visualise the discriminatory power of the test. The median (interquartile range) faecal tumour M2-PK concentration was 8.6 U mL −1 (2.8–18.0) among CRC patients and < 2 U mL −1 (< 2–3.2; P < 0.0001) in the population sample. At a cutoff value of 4 U mL −1, sensitivity (95% confidence interval) was 85% (65–96%) for colon cancer and 56% (41–74%) for rectum cancer. Specificity (95% confidence interval) was estimated to be 79% (76–81%). Given the comparatively high sensitivity of the tumour M2-PK stool test (especially for colon cancer) and its simple analysis, the potential use of the test for early detection of CRC merits further investigation. Possibilities to enhance specificity of the test should be explored.

### Fecal markers: calprotectin and lactoferrin [^1122J3pK]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Overall, fecal markers have been found to be more accurate than serum markers. However, fecal markers are not specific for IBD and may be elevated in a range of organic conditions. Fecal calprotectin and lactoferrin can still differentiate inflammatory disease from functional bowel disorders. Comparison studies have found an overall diagnostic accuracy in IBD of 80% to 100% for both calprotectin and lactoferrin. Elevated levels are found in both CD and UC making it difficult to distinguish between these 2 diagnoses from these biomarkers alone. Both markers correlated well to mucosal healing and histologic improvement. Hence, they may be useful in monitoring response to treatment and predicting endoscopic and clinical relapse. Overall, patients with elevated markers were at higher risk of postoperative recurrence than those with normal levels. Fecal markers are useful in predicting pouchitis as well. Fecal markers are helpful as an adjunctive tool in overall evaluation of patients with nonspecific symptoms and as a management tool in those with inflammatory disease to monitor disease activity and possibility of relapse. They are less invasive than colonoscopy and can help guide management in a more cost-effective manner.

### Clinical utility of fecal calprotectin: potential applications beyond inflammatory bowel disease for the primary care physician [^112GBgCb]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gastrointestinal (GI) complaints, such as abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea, are common symptoms in the general population and prevalent in the primary care setting, but may also be a presentation of various GI organic or functional diseases. Defining the underlying etiology is generally challenging and necessitates complementary diagnostic examinations, including blood tests, imaging, endoscopy and histology. The introduction of noninvasive diagnostic tools into clinical practice has been invaluable in the assessment of various GI symptoms and may ultimately decrease the use of invasive, complicated, expensive and potentially harmful procedures, such as endoscopy. In the last decade new markers have been extensively investigated with the aim of identifying a universal marker that can be introduced into clinical practice for primary care physicians and gastroenterologists. Fecal calprotectin (FC) appears to be the best candidate, as testing for levels of this protein has high accuracy, reproducibility and practicality, the test is easy to perform, and the results are simple to interpret. FC is a protein heterodimer (A100A8/A9) released by granulocytes, monocytes, macrophages and epithelial cells during an inflammatory response, with inflammatory cells accumulating in the mucosa. FC is subsequently released in the stool, from where it can be measured using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and it is resistant to metabolic degradation for up to 7 days at room temperature. Roseth et al showed a good correlation between FC and the fecal excretion of indium-111-labeled granulocytes via scintigraphy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Several groups have investigated FC concentrations in healthy individuals and a cutoff of 50 μg/g for a positive test has been suggested, although a cutoff of 100 μg/g appears to have better accuracy for an IBD diagnosis, while factors such as type of assay and manufacturers' recommendations should also be considered. Several factors affect FC levels, including acute GI infections, colon adenomas and malignancies, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and age, since children under the age of 5 years have been found to have higher FC concentrations, probably due to higher intestinal permeability.

In patients with unknown endoscopic remission status, certainty was "low for calprotectin < 50 μg/g and very low for cutoffs of < 150 μg/g and < 250 μg/g… because both the point estimate and 95% CI are higher than FN threshold of 5%". For ruling in disease, "in patients with CD in symptomatic remission… there was very low certainty of evidence supporting the use of any proposed cutoff of elevated fecal calprotectin… due to unacceptably high rates of FP… and inconsistency".

### The role of faecal calprotectin in diagnosis and staging of colorectal neoplasia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114TcqMq]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The presence of inflammation is a key hallmark of cancer and, plays an important role in disease progression and survival in colorectal cancer (CRC). Calprotectin detected in the faeces is a sensitive measure of colonic inflammation. The role of FC as a diagnostic test that may categorise patients by risk of neoplasia is poorly defined. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to characterise the relationship between elevations of FC and colorectal neoplasia.

Methods

A systematic review was performed using the keywords (MESH terms) and a statistical and meta-analysis was performed.

Results

A total of 35 studies are included in this review. CRC patients are more likely than controls to have an elevated FC OR 5.19, 95% CI 3.12–8.62, p < 0.001 with a heterogeneity (I² = 27%). No tumour characteristics significantly correlated with FC, only stage of CRC shows signs that it may potentially correlate with FC.

Conclusion

FC levels are significantly higher in CRC, with high sensitivity. Its low specificity prevents it from being used to diagnose or screen for CRC.

### Can 2 different fecal calprotectin assays be used interchangeably in IBD treatment? [^115debNs]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

A total of 171 patients were included in this study: 125 adults and 46 children, all diagnosed with IBD. Baseline characteristics of the included patients are displayed in Table 1.

TABLE 1
Patient Demographics at Baseline

FC Measurements

Median (interquartile ranges) FC levels were 281 mg/kg (70 to 971) for the measurements by EK-Cal and 159 mg/kg (31 to 778) for the measurements by the EliA 2. The mean difference between the 2 assays was 89 mg/kg (range, −1140 to 1341). Figure 1 displays the Bland-Altman plot in which the mean FC level per patient is plotted against the difference (ΔFC) between the 2 measurements. It demonstrates a wide range between the limits of agreement (−487 to 666 mg/kg), resulting from an increase in ΔFC in patients with a higher mean FC level. This indicates a larger interassay variability in patients with a high FC level. The categorized FC results per assay are displayed in Table 2. In 5 of 171 patients (3%), there was a difference of 2 categories between the 2 assays and in 25 of 171 (15%), there was a difference of 1 category. For the whole population and the adult population, there was substantial agreement between the 2 assays [κ: 0.78; SE: 0.04; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.71–0.86; and κ: 0.72; SE: 0.06; 95% CI: 0.60–0.83, respectively], as assessed with the linear weighted κ. For the pediatric population the agreement was almost perfect (κ: 0.83; SE: 0.06; 95% CI: 0.70–0.95).

Cover drug and disease activity monitoring — medical providers and insurers must recognize the need for objective longitudinal monitoring and pharmacokinetic assessments, and insurance coverage should encourage specific tests. Medical providers and insurers must recognize that appropriate drug therapy requires objective longitudinal disease activity monitoring and assessments of drug pharmacokinetics. The current standard of care is a treat-to-target approach in which objective assessments of intestinal inflammation directly influence drug selection and optimization. Insurance coverage for disease activity monitoring should acknowledge this value and encourage use of objective testing including colonoscopy, noninvasive biomarkers such as calprotectin, video capsule endoscopy, and cross-sectional imaging with ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. In addition, drug dose optimization requires pharmacokinetic assessments with drug level and anti–drug antibody testing, and coverage for these essential tests allows appropriate medication escalation or de-escalation, ultimately impacting outcomes, complications, patient quality of life, and costs.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^117XpvAB]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis — fecal calprotectin (FC) as a biomarker: Calprotectin comprises 60% of soluble proteins in neutrophil cytosol, FC levels correlate with endoscopic and histologic inflammation, and are more sensitive and specific than serum inflammatory markers while being less invasive than endoscopy or biopsies. Cut-offs are not prospectively validated and vary by clinical question; in separate studies, FC < 60 mg/g and < 187 mg/g predicted deep remission and mucosal healing, respectively, whereas FC > 321 mg/g in clinical remission predicted increased relapse risk at 6 and 12 months. A meta-analysis reported an optimal cut-off of 50 μg/g, and the best specificity of 78.2% (57.8–80.6) occurred with cut-offs greater than 100 μg/g. Mild elevations may occur with proton pump inhibitors and obesity. In individual patients, serial FC can be useful to predict response to therapy or relapse, FC correlates with histologic activity, and robust data support FC as an appropriate surrogate to sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy for assessment and monitoring of mucosal inflammation.

Concluding remarks

Because of its positive attributes, the evaluation of FC as a biomarker in clinical practice for the diagnosis and monitoring of several GI disorders has yielded encouraging results. Its potential utilization is currently being investigated by many research groups from different fields and a significant body of data has emerged in recent years. Currently, the best available evidence in the literature supports its use in IBD diagnosis and monitoring, as well as in distinguishing between IBD and IBS. The increased level of FC in MC is interesting because of the scarcity of neutrophils. Despite these results obtained to date, the role of FC in diagnosing and managing MC remains to be validated by future multicenter studies, although higher levels of FC appear to be a surrogate marker of active MC. FC levels were found to be significantly higher in patients with severe CDI compared to mild CDI and to the control group, and the implementation of FC levels as a predictive marker for assessing and stratifying CDI severity has been proposed. FC levels may have a practical use in detecting inflammation and response to treatment in DD patients. In addition FC > 60 μg/g was correlated with acute complications of DD. Knowledge is evolving concerning its potential application in various GI conditions, such as CD, CRC, GVHD and others, and further studies are required to address the many uncertainties which remain and to better define the use of FC levels in clinical practice.

Prognostic significance of biomarker magnitude and persistence in ulcerative colitis — The guideline did not examine prognostic significance of the magnitude and persistence of biomarker elevation, and a single measurement versus sustained or marked elevation may carry different prognostic implications than a more modest elevation. For example, in individuals with mild symptoms, fecal calprotectin > 2500 μg/g may carry different implications for management than fecal calprotectin of 251 μg/g, yet there were insufficient data to guide nuanced decision making. Combination of biomarkers, such as elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) with an elevated fecal calprotectin, may have different management implications than a single biomarker, and several novel biomarkers and panels require more robust clinical validation; the paucity of data was identified as a knowledge gap requiring further research.

### Tumour M2-PK as a stool marker for colorectal cancer: comparative analysis in a large sample of unselected older adults vs colorectal cancer patients [^114GXtBp]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Another aspect that deserves more consideration is the potential presence of adenomas among controls with 'false'-positive test result. Screening and autopsy studies found that the prevalence of adenomas in this age group is about 30% and other studies have reported a sensitivity of the tumour M2-PK test to detect adenomas of about 30%. Model calculations showed that specificity increases from 73.0 to 74.7 and 79.0% assuming a sensitivity for adenomas of 30 and 40%, respectively (and assuming a prevalence of adenomas and CRC of 30 and 0.5%, respectively; see Appendix B). These figures suggest that specificity is likely to be slightly higher among subjects who are endoscopically proven free of colorectal lesions.

So far, specificity of the tumour M2-PK test has only been estimated based on selected high-risk controls. Our results suggest that specificity may be slightly higher in an asymptomatic screening population. Nevertheless, the false-positive rate of this test is still high and possibilities to enhance specificity should be explored. Considering the current specificity, it is debatable whether implementation of this test in a population-based screening setting is justifiable, from both an ethical and an economic point of view. However, while awaiting the development of an optimal screening test, it may be an option for individuals who wish a test with a higher sensitivity than the FOBT (provided that high sensitivity is confirmed by further studies) and who are well informed on possible false-positive findings. Furthermore, as previous simulations have shown, limited specificity in the long run may reduce CRC incidence by ensuring that a large proportion of screened subjects undergo colonoscopy even though more focused and economic approaches to achieve this goal would be highly desirable.

### Tumour M2-PK as a stool marker for colorectal cancer: comparative analysis in a large sample of unselected older adults vs colorectal cancer patients [^112ib8Pg]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

RESULTS

In Table 1, the CRC patients, the subgroup of the ESTHER participants included in this analysis and the whole ESTHER study population are described with respect to age, sex, body mass index, alcohol consumption, smoking status, family history of CRC (the latter information was available for ESTHER study participants only) and neoadjuvant treatment (CRC cases only). Median age among CRC patients was 65 years and about one-third of the patients were females. Median age in the subgroup of the ESTHER study was 62 years, a slight majority were females. The subgroup of the ESTHER study did not differ from the whole ESTHER study population with respect to the distribution of age, sex, body mass index, smoking status and family history of CRC.

The median (interquartile range) tumour M2-PK concentration for the CRC patients was 8.6 U mL −1 (2.8–18.0) with a striking difference between colon and rectum cancer (9.5 U mL −1, 6.2–18.4 and 5.5 U mL −1, < 2–18.0, respectively). The median (interquartile range) tumour M2-PK concentration in the subsample of the ESTHER study was < 2 U mL −1 (< 2–3.2). The difference in median tumour M2-PK levels in stool between ESTHER participants and both subgroups of CRC patients was highly statistically significant (P < 0.0001 for colon and rectum cancer, respectively; see Figure 1).

In the patient sample, 60% of tumours were located in the rectum (as the recruiting hospital was a referral centre for rectal cancer patients). The most frequent tumour stage was T3 (34 out of 65). Information allowing Dukes' classification was available for 48 patients. Twelve patients presented with Dukes' stage A, 18 with Dukes' stage B, 12 with Dukes' stage C and 6 with Dukes' stage D. At a cutoff value of 4 U mL −1, overall sensitivity (95% confidence interval) was 68% (55–79%), with a clear difference between colon cancer (85%) and rectum cancer (56%) (P = 0.02; see Table 2). Sensitivity (95% confidence interval) by tumour size was 67% (22–96%), 44% (20–70%), 71% (53–85%) and 100% (40–100%) for T1–T4, respectively, and by Dukes' stage it was 67% (35–90%), 61% (36–83%), 67% (35–90%) and 100% (54–100%) for Dukes' stage A, B, C and D, respectively. As regards neoadjuvant therapy, no impact on sensitivity could be observed.

Of the ESTHER study participants, 21% showed a positive test result at the cutoff value of 4 U mL −1, that is, overall specificity was 79% (see Table 3). There was no clear association between age, sex, body mass index or family history of CRC and a positive test result. However, current smokers showed more frequently increased levels of tumour M2-PK in stool compared to never and former smokers (P = 0.003).

The results of the ROC analysis are shown in Figure 2 for both colon and rectum cancer as well as for both forms of cancer combined. With an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.789, the overall discriminatory power of the test was good. The AUC for colon cancer (0.857) was larger than the AUC for rectum cancer (0.744).

### Clinical utility of fecal calprotectin monitoring in asymptomatic patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and practical guide [^116dsxvg]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

In asymptomatic patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), "monitoring" involves repeated testing aimed at early recognition of disease exacerbation. We aimed to determine the usefulness of repeated fecal calprotectin (FC) measurements to predict IBD relapses by a systematic literature review.

Methods

An electronic search was performed in Medline, Embase, and Cochrane from inception to April 2016. Inclusion criteria were prospective studies that followed patients with IBD in remission at baseline and had at least 2 consecutive FC measurements with a test interval of 2 weeks to 6 months. Methodological assessment was based on the second Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) checklist.

Results

A total of 1719 articles were identified; 193 were retrieved for full text review. Six studies met eligibility for inclusion. The time interval between FC tests varied between 1 and 3 months. Asymptomatic patients with IBD who had repeated FC measurements above the study's cutoff level had a 53% to 83% probability of developing disease relapse within the next 2 to 3 months. Patients with repeated normal FC values had a 67% to 94% probability to remain in remission in the next 2 to 3 months. The ideal FC cutoff for monitoring could not be identified because of the limited number studies meeting inclusion criteria and heterogeneity between selected studies.

Conclusions

Two consecutively elevated FC values are highly associated with disease relapse, indicating a consideration to proactively optimize IBD therapy plans. More prospective data are necessary to assess whether FC monitoring improves health outcomes.

However, a recent cohort study of 300,724 participants found with a much smaller number of incident cases, that obesity/high BMI was not associated with the risk of development of CD. Participants were men and women aged 20 to 80 years from 10 European countries without CD or UC. Recruitment took place from 1991 to 1998 and participants were followed up until 2004. Median age of CD diagnosis was 56.4 (range 24 to 78.7 years), much older than the previous two confirmatory studies with median time after recruitment of 5.1 years (range 1.5 years to 14 years) However the incident cases of CD in this study was 75 which is fewer than NHS 2 which had a total of 144 incident cases. In addition the length of follow up is also comparatively shorter. It may be possible therefore that a true risk was not detected due to small number of the incident cases, and the different age range of cases meant that a different spectrum of Montreal sub-types was being studied.

As an implementation alternative, repeat measurement of biomarkers (in 3–6 months) may be reasonable, but if biomarkers remain elevated on repeat evaluation then endoscopic assessment may be warranted.

Laboratory analyses

For the quantitative measurement of tumour M2-PK, stool samples were thawed and a special stick capturing 4 mg of stool was loaded. Stool samples of both the CRC patients and the ESTHER participants were examined with the ScheBo® Tumour M2-PK test (ScheBo Biotech, Giessen, Germany), a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on two monoclonal antibodies specific for tumour M2-PK. The test allows quantitative measurement of tumour M2-PK in 4 mg of stool with a lower detection limit of 2 U mL −1. All analyses were carried out in a central laboratory under standardised conditions.

Statistical analyses

The CRC patients were characterised with respect to age, gender, body mass index, current smoking status, tumour stage, tumour location and neoadjuvant therapy. The subsample of the ESTHER study was described with respect to age, gender, body mass index, family history of CRC and smoking status; the distribution of levels of faecal tumour M2-PK among ESTHER participants was assessed according to these factors.

To estimate performance characteristics regarding the detection of CRC, the distribution of faecal tumour M2-PK concentrations among participants of the ESTHER Study and among CRC patients was compared. Sensitivity and specificity of the test were calculated at a cutoff value of 4 U mL −1, the cutoff level proposed by the manufacturer, and 95% confidence intervals were determined based on the exact binomial distribution. In addition, sensitivity and specificity were derived at a broad range of alternative cutoff values and receiver-operating characteristic curves (ROC) were constructed to visualise the discriminatory power of the test. To estimate the area under the ROC, the curve was linearly extrapolated beyond the lower detection limit of 2 U mL −1.

To assess the impact of different sample treatment between ESTHER study participants (stool samples were mailed before freezing) and CRC patients (stool samples were frozen immediately), sensitivity analyses were carried out based on the results of stability testing. For that purpose, faecal tumour M2-PK concentrations measured in ESTHER study participants were corrected according to the duration of sample mailing to estimate initial concentrations (the equation is given in Appendix A). The duration of sample mailing was calculated from the date of defecation and the date of receipt of the stool sample. On the basis of corrected values, ROC analyses were repeated as described above and compared to the ROC based on crude values.

Measurement of faecal calprotectin concentration is increasingly used to assess disease activity in patients with IBD.

### Can fecal calprotectin better stratify Crohn's disease activity index? [^113Mk3k5]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

According to estimates of the odds ratio (OR), for every 10 points increase in CDAI score, the odds of having calprotectin ≥ 150 µg/g increases by 30% (OR 1.30309, 95% CI 1.19534–1.42055).

Consistent results were obtained by applying the same analysis model when patients are subdivided according to disease localization (ileum and/or upper gastrointestinal tract-L1, colon-L2, and ileum-colon-L3) (Table 3).

With a CDAI cut-off > 120 we have a high diagnostic accuracy of 72%; 88% for specificity and 50% for sensitivity (positive predictive value: 76%, negative predictive value: 71%).

Only a small proportion of patients with abdominal discomfort have organic disease, but a correct diagnosis can seldom be made by simple clinical examination. Additional diagnostic procedures must be employed, but these are expensive and demanding and carry a certain risk. Assessment of faecal concentrations of the neutrophil granulocyte-derived protein calprotectin can be used as a screening test — an 'ESR of the gut' — to select patients for further examination. The test can be performed on 1–2 g of random stool samples that can be sent to the laboratory by ordinary mail since the protein is remarkably stable in stools. The test has high sensitivities and specificities for gastrointestinal cancers and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Faecal calprotectin levels reflect the disease activity in IBD and can be used to monitor the response to treatment and detect relapses.

The principal analysis was performed using the first FC measurement for each patient for those in whom there was more than 1. Because of the retrospective nature of this data set, these were not taken at uniform intervals. Exploratory analysis of multiple FC measurements was performed using the median for each rolling 6-month period centered on each month after diagnosis and stratified by progression in Montreal behavior. FC measurements were excluded from this analysis if the patient was symptomatic at the time of sampling.

This study was conducted as a service evaluation using data collected routinely as part of clinical care, and therefore following guidance from the UK Health Research Authority did not require specific ethical approval or consent.

### Can 2 different fecal calprotectin assays be used interchangeably in IBD treatment? [^1133XbqD]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Fecal Calprotectin (FC) levels can be used as a surrogate marker for disease activity in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Calprotectin is released into the intestinal lumen from the neutrophils in the mucosa during inflammation, and measuring the levels of FC thus reflects intestinal inflammation. Not only can FC levels be used to discriminate between IBD and functional gastrointestinal disorders in patients with chronic abdominal pain, these measurements also have a prominent place in today's clinical care of patients with IBD; FC is used to discriminate between active and quiescent IBD, and has a higher accuracy than other biomarkers such as C-reactive protein (CRP).

Despite its widespread use, there is currently no consensus on the optimal cutoff value for discriminating active disease from remission in patients with IBD. This lack of consensus is partly caused by questions about the variability between different assays used to measure FC. Several studies have demonstrated varying accuracies when comparing different FC assays head-to-head,–but these studies mainly focused on discriminating between healthy controls and patients with IBD.

As in practice patients frequently switch between different laboratories where different assays are used, we need to know whether different assays classify disease activity in the same way in order to correctly monitor the disease activity of our patients with IBD. This study aimed to answer the following research question: "Can two different FC assays be used interchangeably in IBD monitoring?" Our primary outcome was the agreement between the 2 assays, as assessed with the weighted κ.

### Biomarkers in juvenile idiopathic arthritis: towards precision diagnosis and personalized therapy? [^112Z6XLj]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose To Review

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common chronic rheumatic disease in children, characterized by persistent joint inflammation with heterogeneous clinical subtypes. Early diagnosis and targeted treatment remain critical to improving long-term outcomes. In recent years, research has increasingly focused on the identification and validation of biomarkers to enhance diagnostic precision, predict disease course, and guide therapeutic decisions.

Recent Findings

Calprotectin (S100A8/A9) is a pro-inflammatory protein complex released by activated neutrophils and monocytes. In JIA, serum and synovial fluid calprotectin levels correlate with disease activity and may outperform traditional markers like C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Evidence suggests that elevated calprotectin levels can predict flares and subclinical inflammation, making it a promising biomarker for monitoring and prognosis in JIA. Novel biomarkers including microRNAs show potential for differentiating disease subtypes and monitoring treatment response. Proteomic and metabolomic profiling are also uncovering candidates that may improve early diagnosis and personalized management.

Summary

Biomarkers have emerged as pivotal tools in the management of JIA, offering significant advantages in both therapeutic decision-making and long-term monitoring. In the future, a robust biomarker framework holds the potential to improve early diagnosis, guide personalized treatment strategies, and enhance outcome prediction-ultimately contributing to more effective and individualized care for patients with JIA.

### Association between level of fecal calprotectin and progression of Crohn's disease [^112XCa8p]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

We have shown that increased FC concentration at any point in the disease course beyond the first year correlates with poorer outcome. Previous studies have shown an increase in symptomatic relapse in patients with an increase of FC level, our study further indicates that this is associated with an increase in disease progression. The CALM study recently showed better outcomes at 52 weeks when a strategy incorporating symptoms, C-reactive protein level, and FC level was compared with clinical disease activity alone. Together, these data now clearly support a treat-to-target strategy combining a patient-reported symptom score with FC as a marker of mucosal inflammation.

Strengths of the present study include the large number of patients and duration of follow-up evaluation, with a median follow-up time after index FC of longer than 4 years. A clinically relevant definition of disease progression was selected a priori, and rich phenotype information was available. Restricting measurement of end points to at least 90 days after the index FC measurement should reduce bias from measuring disease activity associated with an exacerbation that went on to cause hospital admission or surgical resection. It also can be observed that the survival curves in Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure 3, Supplementary Figure 4, Supplementary Figure 5 continue to separate for many months after the index FC. This suggests that identification of mucosal inflammation at any point in patient follow-up evaluation, even at relatively modest levels previously considered acceptable (ie, FC, 115–250 ug/g), should warrant careful monitoring and a low threshold for treatment escalation decisions.

Limitations of this study relate to its retrospective nature. FC measurements were not collected at fixed intervals, but as determined by the treating clinician. However, routine monitoring of FC levels including in asymptomatic patients was established quite early on in Edinburgh after the full roll-out of the FC test in 2005. The study also was performed at a single center, which may reduce heterogeneity, but at the expense of generalizability. Nonetheless, although the Western General Hospital is a referral center, it also has a large secondary care population from the local catchment. Finally, medication data were completed as accurately as was possible, but it is possible some courses of steroids, particularly those in primary care, may have been missed. This is unlikely to have introduced any systematic bias.

In conclusion, we have shown in this study that increased FC levels are associated with an increased risk of disease progression over time in CD. Further studies should continue to explore the utility of repeated FC measurements, and to assess whether intervention based on FC concentration can alter disease outcome.

### Tumour M2-PK as a stool marker for colorectal cancer: comparative analysis in a large sample of unselected older adults vs colorectal cancer patients [^112kckzN]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this study, performance characteristics for the tumour M2-PK stool test, a novel approach aimed at detecting CRC in the screening setting, were estimated by comparing tumour M2-PK concentrations in CRC patients and in a large sample of unselected older adults supposed to be healthy controls. With the cutoff level at 4 U mL −1 (recommended by the manufacturer), overall sensitivity for CRC was 68%. Albeit not perfect, this detection rate compares superior to FOBT and to the results reported for several DNA-based stool tests.

Colon cancer was detected with a remarkable sensitivity of 85%, which was higher than for rectum cancer (56%). Correcting for the unusually high proportion of rectal cancer patients in our sample (60% in our sample vs 20% in population-based series of CRC patients;) overall sensitivity for CRC would be 79%. This estimate is in line with the finding of a recently published prospective study reporting an overall sensitivity of 81%. As regards sensitivity by tumour stage, no relevant difference could be observed between Dukes' A, Dukes' B and Dukes' C, but sensitivity was maximal for Dukes' D. However, given that in our study the number of cases per stage was rather limited, larger studies are needed to estimate sensitivity by tumour stage more precisely.

Specificity in terms of detecting CRC (ie, the denominator comprises subjects who do not have CRC) in this study was estimated to be about 79% (73% after correction for potential degradation) at the proposed cutoff level of 4 U mL −1. This estimate is based on tumour M2-PK concentrations determined in average-risk subjects who did not undergo colonoscopy, that is, the current status of the colon and rectum in this population sample serving as control group was unknown. The putative false positive rate may therefore comprise a small number of not yet diagnosed CRC patients. The prevalence of undiagnosed CRC in this age group has been reported to be below 1%. Model calculations showed that specificity increases from 73.0 to 73.3% and 73.5% assuming a prevalence of undiagnosed CRC of 0, 0.5% and 1.0%, respectively (see Appendix B). Thus, the resulting error (ie, an underestimation of specificity) should be very small.

### Can 2 different fecal calprotectin assays be used interchangeably in IBD treatment? [^111xbgcw]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analyses

Normally distributed variables were displayed as means with SDs, and non-normally distributed variables were displayed as medians with interquartile ranges. Interassay variability was first displayed in a Bland-Altman plot, and then the difference in the categorization of the FC result was assessed with the linear weighted κ. The agreement was assessed for the whole population together and also separately for the pediatric (ie: < 18 y) and adult population. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the agreement for patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) separately, and patients with small bowel disease (CD L1) and large bowel disease (CD L2 and UC) separately. Values for the agreement were judged as follows: κ < 0.0: poor; κ 0.0 to 0.20: slight; 0.21 to 0.40: fair; 0.41 to 0.60: moderate; 0.61 to 0.80: substantial; > 0.80, almost perfect. For the analysis, FC measurements > 1800 mg/kg were displayed as 1800 mg/kg, as the EK-Cal test could not measure higher values.

### Clinical utility of fecal calprotectin: potential applications beyond inflammatory bowel disease for the primary care physician [^111J4tUH]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Fecal calprotectin (FC) is an inflammatory marker released mainly from gastrointestinal granulocytes measured in stool samples. FC is noninvasive, economical, simple, and acceptable for patients. Levels of FC have proven reliable for intestinal inflammation, with good clinical sensitivity, and are useful in screening and monitoring inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), as well as in the differential diagnosis between IBD and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Given its advantages, FC represents an attractive biomarker that could be utilized in various gastrointestinal (GI) diseases apart from IBD, and is currently being studied extensively by many research groups with significant amounts of data emerging. In this current review we aim to provide an outline of the utility of FC in distinguishing between IBS and IBD, as well as an up-to-date summary of the available clinical experience concerning FC in various common conditions of the GI tract commonly encountered by gastroenterology practitioners, such as IBS, microscopic colitis, acute gastroenteritis, Clostridium difficile infection, colorectal cancer, diverticular disease, coeliac disease, and other GI conditions.

### New faecal tests for colorectal cancer screening: is tumour pyruvate kinase M2 one of the options? [^111z2dMY]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

One of the limitations of their study was a retrospective study design with historical controls; these subjects did not undergo either any of the more accurate faecal screening test, for example, IFOBT (immunological FOBT) or a colonoscopy for confirming the results of M2-PK in detecting CRC. Thus, if the prevalence of CRC is taken to be 1% in the historical controls, there lies a possibility of missing out significant number of CRC in the control group considering such a low performance characteristics which is highly unacceptable.

We agree with the authors that the poor performance characteristics (especially low specificity and poor PPV) of faecal tumour M2-pyruvate kinase (M2-PK) as has also been reported in previous prospective study does not warrant its use as a marker for CRC screening. This is particularly relevant when other better options are available for stool testing for CRC namely IFOBT and should have been discussed by the authors. These ELISA-based IFOBTs or automatically analysable IFOBT have demonstrated sensitivity of around 60% and specificity of about 90%. Recently various 'office based or bedside' simple, convenient and cheap strip-based IFOBT have been validated for CRC screening with performance characteristics similar to that of an ELISA-based IFOBT. In fact our group compared an office-based IFOBT with that of M2-PK to show that M2-PK and IFOBT had a sensitivity of 80.4 vs 72.3% for diagnosing CRN, whereas specificity for these tests were 76.3 vs 94.7%, respectively. All the above information further demonstrates it emphatically that M2-PK cannot be recommended as a marker for CRC screening.

Considering above factors it would be really catastrophic to recommend M2-PK as a biomarker for screening patients with CRC when much better options for the same are available.

### Sensitivity and specificity of faecal tumour M2 pyruvate kinase for detection of colorectal adenomas in a large screening study [^112npNrw]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Results

Overall, 1082 participants (mean age 63 years, 50% females) were included in the analyses. Although the majority of stool samples arrived at the laboratory within 1 day, 32% of samples arrived after 2 days only. The median (interquartile range) tumour M2 PK level in the whole study population was 1.3 U mL −1 (0.3–3.3). Median tumour M2 PK levels did not differ by gender or duration of mailing, but tended to be higher in older age groups (P = 0.002) (see Table 1).

The distribution of findings at colonoscopy, median tumour M2 PK and test performance characteristics at a cutoff level of 4 U mL −1 (recommended by the manufacturer) by subgroup are shown in Table 2. Overall, about 30% of participants had at least one adenoma and about 10% of participants had an advanced adenoma. Sensitivity (95% CI) for advanced adenomas and other adenomas was 22% (14–31%) and 23% (17–29%), respectively. There was no significant variation of sensitivity by location, number or size of adenomas. Sensitivity appeared to be slightly higher among participants with three or more adenomas, but CIs were wide given the small number of patients in this group. Sensitivity did not vary by age, gender or shipping time of stool samples. The positive predictive value (95% CI) was 34% (28–41%) for bearing any adenoma and 11% (7–16%) for bearing an advanced adenoma.

Specificity (95% CI) was about 82% (78–84%), irrespective of whether participants with hyperplastic polyps were included as controls or not. Specificity did not vary in gender or shipping time of stool samples, but tended to be lower in older age groups (P = 0.001). The negative predictive value was 61% (57–64%) when including only participants with no polyp as controls and 71% (68–74%) when including participants with hyperplastic or no polyp as controls.

The AUC (95% CI) was 0.54 (0.51–0.58) for advanced adenomas and 0.56 (0.52–0.59) for other adenomas (see Figure 1).

### AGA clinical practice update on management of inflammatory bowel disease during the COVID-19 pandemic: expert commentary [^117DYF93]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) during the COVID-19 pandemic — active IBD with concern for relapse is managed by sequential steps that include "Consider IBD relapse unrelated to COVID-19", "Confirm inflammation by non-endoscopic approach (CRP, Fecal calprotectin, other)", assessment of drug exposure and adherence ("Is there sufficient drug present? (Consider thiopurine metabolites or serum concentration of biologics)" and "Is the patient adherent?"), "Restart prior therapy" when appropriate, and therapy selection by "Activity of the IBD?" with symptom-directed options such as "Consider topical (rectal) therapies, oral budesonide, symptomatic therapies" or standard escalation where "Treat as you would normally do with existing therapy (benefits outweigh risks). Consider avoiding thiopurines, methotrexate, tofacitinib".

### Association between level of fecal calprotectin and progression of Crohn's disease [^115JwPv3]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study shows that increased FC concentration is associated with increased disease progression, both as defined by a composite primary end point of advance in Montreal luminal behavior, surgical resection, and hospitalization, and by each of these end points when considered individually.

Mucosal healing is recognized as a target for therapy in Crohn's disease, with poorer prognosis and a higher risk of surgery associated with increased endoscopic disease activity. There is a strong correlation between FC, endoscopic disease activity, and ulcer depth. Our data show more directly that increased FC can be used as a marker of increased risk of progression.

Although absolute index FC levels were lower in L1 patients, FC concentration better predicted poorer outcomes in patients with L1/L3 rather than L2 disease distribution. Patients with active colonic disease may be more likely to show symptoms, and thus have an earlier intervention. In contrast, patients with active ileal disease may tolerate a higher level of subclinical inflammation, resulting in a delay of treatment with a greater risk of progression and complications.

Other variables associated with an adverse outcome in our analysis included younger age, which has been identified previously as an adverse prognostic factor, and previous immunomodulator use, which is likely to be a marker for a more aggressive prior disease course. Symptomatically active disease was associated with an increased rate of disease progression independently of increased FC. This validates a treat-to-target approach aiming for a combination of resolution of symptoms as well as mucosal healing, with FC being a marker of the latter.

Thresholds for prediction of disease relapse have varied across the literature, influenced by the disease cohort being studied and the assay used. Several studies have identified a cut-off value of 250 μg/g as being useful to distinguish active from inactive disease. In the present study, the optimal separation between survival curves for progression of disease was seen using a lower threshold of 115 μg/g, suggesting that lower levels of inflammatory activity still may be associated with an adverse outcome. However, any such threshold needs to be interpreted in the context of the methods of FC extraction and measurement. For example, others have shown significant variability in FC measurement between weight-based and other methods of FC extraction, and similarly when comparing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits from different manufacturers.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of Crohn's disease [^1125Pm2b]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

AGA guideline — biomarkers for symptomatic Crohn's disease (CD) with moderate to severe symptoms: The AGA suggests using fecal calprotectin > 150 μg/g or C-reactive protein (CRP) > 5 mg/L to rule in active inflammation, inform treatment adjustment, and avoid routine endoscopic assessment of disease activity (Conditional recommendation, low to moderate certainty of evidence). In the same symptom group with normal biomarkers (fecal calprotectin < 150 μg/g, CRP ≤ 5 mg/L), the AGA suggests endoscopic assessment of disease activity rather than empiric treatment adjustment (Conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence).

### Fecal osteoprotegerin may guide the introduction of second-line therapy in hospitalized children with ulcerative colitis [^112YKQoX]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is increased in inflamed colonic mucosa and has a role in immune regulation and apoptosis resistance. Fecal OPG may be useful in predicting corticosteroid resistance in hospitalized children with severe ulcerative colitis (UC). We aimed to determine whether fecal OPG predicts the need for second-line therapies in children hospitalized for UC.

Methods

We included 83 children with UC admitted for intravenous corticosteroid treatment. Children were classified as responders/nonresponders based on the need for therapy escalation. Fecal OPG results were compared with those of four other fecal markers.

Results

Of the enrolled children, seven had day 1 samples only, 53 children had day 3 samples only, and 23 had both. Twenty-two children failed corticosteroid therapy and required infliximab (n = 20) or colectomy (n = 2). On the third treatment day the median fecal OPG levels were significantly higher in the nonresponders group compared with the responders: 77 pmol/L (interquartile range [IQR] 27–137) versus 13 pmol/L (3–109); P = 0.007. The best day 3 fecal OPG cutoff to predict second-line therapy was > 50 pmol/L with a sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 69% (area under the receiver operator curve [ROC] of 0.70%-95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57–0.82). Fecal OPG was superior to day 3 fecal calprotectin, lactoferrin, and S100A12 as a predictor of corticosteroid nonresponse, but equivalent to the less commonly used M2-pyruvate kinase.

Conclusions

Day 3 fecal OPG may guide the decision to institute second-line therapy in children with severe UC. The role of OPG in the inflammatory response in pediatric UC deserves further study.

AGA ulcerative colitis (UC) biomarkers — management of elevated markers in symptomatic remission — in patients with UC in symptomatic remission but elevated stool or serum markers of inflammation (fecal calprotectin > 150 µg/g, elevated fecal lactoferrin, elevated CRP), the AGA suggests endoscopic assessment of disease activity rather than empiric treatment adjustment; for such patients, repeat measurement of biomarkers (in 3–6 mo) may be a reasonable alternative to endoscopic assessment, but if biomarkers are elevated on repeat evaluation, then endoscopic assessment may be warranted.

Fecal calprotectin — certainty of evidence for ruling out or in endoscopic inflammation: In low pretest probability settings, there was low certainty of evidence supporting cutoffs of < 50 µg/g and < 150 µg/g to rule out moderate to severe endoscopic inflammation, and very low certainty for < 250 µg/g. In intermediate pretest probability settings, there was very low certainty for using fecal calprotectin to rule out due to unacceptably high false negatives, with the point estimate crossing the false negative (FN) threshold of 5%, and very low certainty for using elevated fecal calprotectin to rule in because of unacceptably high false positives (FP) and inconsistency.

### Sensitivity and specificity of faecal tumour M2 pyruvate kinase for detection of colorectal adenomas in a large screening study [^112qpm2H]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

The measurement of faecal tumour M2 pyruvate kinase (tumour M2 PK) has been proposed as a novel approach for early detection of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, as regards the potential of the test to detect precursors to CRC, an issue that is highly relevant to estimate its use in reducing CRC incidence and mortality, the available evidence is scant and controversial. The aim of our study was to determine the performance characteristics of the tumour M2 PK test with respect to colorectal adenomas in the target population of screening. Among 1082 participants of screening colonoscopy in Germany, of whom 30% had any adenoma and 10% had an advanced adenoma, the median (interquartile range) tumour M2 PK level in the whole study population was 1.3 U mL −1 (0.3–3.3). At a cutoff value of 4 U mL −1, sensitivity was 22 and 23% for detection of advanced and other adenomas, respectively, whereas specificity was 82%. The area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (95% confidence interval) was 0.54 (0.51–0.58) and 0.56 (0.52–0.59) for advanced and other adenomas, respectively. In conclusion, the tumour M2 PK test has only very limited potential to distinguish between people bearing precursors to CRC and people with no finding at colonoscopy.

Fecal calprotectin (FC) — diagnostic utility and accuracy: FC is a nonspecific neutrophil marker of inflammation and is elevated in infectious and inflammatory colitis but not in non- inflammatory causes of diarrhea such as irritable bowel syndrome, and several studies have confirmed its utility in differentiating IBD from irritable bowel syndrome using cut-offs that vary from 6 to 280 μg/g of stool. For diagnosis of ulcerative colitis, the pooled sensitivity and specificity of FC are 0.88 and 0.79, respectively, with a modest positive likelihood ratio of 4.2 and a more clinically meaningful negative likelihood ratio of 0.15.

### Faecal tumour M2 pyruvate kinase: a new, sensitive screening tool for colorectal cancer [^114k8WTY]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

For the statistical comparison of the nonparametrically distributed data, the Kruskall–Wallis ANOVA test was used (Statistica Version 5.0, StatSoft® Inc. Tulsa, USA).

Sensitivity was calculated as the number of patients with colorectal cancer who tested positive for Tumour M2-PK (true positives) divided by the total number of histologically confirmed tumour patients (true positives plus false negatives), expressed as a percentage (i.e. sensitivity = (number of true positives/number of tumour patients) × 100).

Specificity was calculated as the number of controls who tested negative for Tumour M2-PK (true negatives) divided by the total number of control subjects (true negatives plus false positives), expressed as a percentage (i.e. specificity = (number of true negatives/number of patients without pathological findings at colonoscopy) × 100).

Fecal calprotectin (fCal) cutoffs — patients with symptomatically active Crohn's disease and mild symptoms — report per‑1000 patients tested (95% CI) at thresholds fCal > 50 μg/g, fCal > 150 μg/g, and fCal > 250 μg/g with a prevalence of 65%. True positives were 572 (514–611), 527 (481–566), and 494 (455–533); false negatives were 78 (39–136), 123 (84–169), and 156 (117–195); true negatives were 235 (179–280), 252 (214–284), and 259 (235–280); and false positives were 115 (70–171), 98 (66–136), and 91 (70–115). GRADE certainty of evidence is LOW b, c for fCal > 50 μg/g and VERY LOW b, c, d for fCal > 150 μg/g and fCal > 250 μg/g.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of Crohn's disease [^114Ldtnm]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Guideline on biomarkers for Crohn's disease (CD) reviews the performance of fecal calprotectin, serum C-reactive protein (CRP), and the Endoscopic Healing Index across asymptomatic patients, those with varying symptom severity, and those in surgically induced remission, and the guideline panel made 11 conditional recommendations. In CD in symptomatic remission, the panel suggests use of a biomarker- and symptom-based monitoring strategy over symptoms alone, and in this setting a fecal calprotectin < 150 μg/g and normal CRP rules out active inflammation, avoiding endoscopic evaluation for assessment of disease activity; however, elevated biomarkers in this setting merit confirmation with endoscopy before treatment adjustment. In CD with mild symptoms, neither normal nor elevated biomarkers alone are sufficiently accurate to determine endoscopic activity, whereas in moderate to severe symptoms, elevated fecal calprotectin or serum CRP suggests endoscopic activity, precluding routine endoscopic assessment for disease activity. In surgically induced remission in low-risk patients on pharmacologic prophylaxis, a normal fecal calprotectin reliably rules out endoscopic recurrence, while in other postoperative settings biomarkers are insufficient for establishing diagnosis of recurrence.

### Role of fecal calprotectin as a biomarker of intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease [^1132s7HV]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Calprotectin is an abundant neutrophil protein found in both plasma and stool that is markedly elevated in infectious and inflammatory conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We conducted a systematic review of the published literature regarding fecal calprotectin to evaluate its potential as a noninvasive marker of neutrophilic intestinal inflammation. Reference ranges for fecal calprotectin have been established in healthy adults and children, and elevated concentrations of fecal calprotectin have been demonstrated in numerous studies of patients with IBD. Fecal calprotectin correlates well with histological inflammation as detected by colonoscopy with biopsies and has been shown successfully to predict relapses and detect pouchitis in patients with IBD. Fecal calprotectin has been shown to consistently differentiate IBD from irritable bowel syndrome because it has excellent negative predictive value in ruling out IBD in undiagnosed, symptomatic patients. Fecal calprotectin also may be useful in determining whether clinical symptoms in patients with known IBD are caused by disease flares or noninflammatory complications/underlying irritable bowel syndrome and in providing objective evidence of response to treatment. Although more studies are needed to define fully the role of fecal calprotectin, convincing studies and growing clinical experience point to an expanded role in the diagnosis and management of IBD.

Ulcerative colitis biomarkers — false-positive tolerance and cutoffs are detailed, with the panel determining a maximal tolerable false-positive threshold at 5% for symptomatically active disease and noting circumstances where higher false-positive rates may be acceptable depending on downstream consequences. For practical implementation, the panel preferred a single fecal calprotectin cutoff (> 150 μg/g) across scenarios, and in typical flare symptoms reported that an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) had very good performance, at least comparable with fecal tests. The document also notes that stool testing to rule out C difficile and other enteric pathogens may still be required for all symptomatic patients.

### What calprotectin cut-offs should apply for IBD in general practice? [^111tWFhq]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

To the Editor

We write in response to the recent article by Dhaliwal et al in Frontline Gastroenterology, which discussed the utility of faecal calprotectin (FC) levels in discriminating between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We applaud the authors' investigation of this important topic given the high prevalence of IBS in general practice, the understandable concern of practitioners in reliably excluding inflammatory conditions in patients with IBS and the imperative to avoid unnecessary diagnostic evaluations.

The main reported results of the Dhaliwal study support previous findings in the published literature that, at a cut-off of 50 µg/g, FC determination demonstrates adequate sensitivity and specificity to distinguish between IBS and IBD. The authors note, however, that raising the cut-off to 100 µg/g 'does further improve' sensitivity and specificity of the FC test, and improves the negative predictive value (NPV) to 97% from 87%. This statement highlights several practical concerns that we believe are of substantial importance for both general practitioners and medical policy decision-makers when interpreting the extensive literature on the role of FC in differentiating IBS and IBD.

First, it is essential for readers to understand which condition (IBS or IBD) is selected as the 'target' when constructing receiver operating characteristic curves for sensitivity and specificity of FC. Although the authors state that '[performance characteristics] for diagnosing IBD… were calculated at different FC cut-off values', it appears they actually use IBS as the target condition for IBS versus IBD in table 3, as evidenced by the increase in sensitivity and (slight) reduction in specificity produced by raising the cut-off. Using the authors' data and switching the target condition to IBD for an indication of IBS versus IBD at FC 50 μg/g yields a sensitivity of 77.7 and specificity of 87.5, the inverse of what is reported in table 3.

Unfortunately, this inconsistency in selecting the target condition is not unusual in the published literature for FC and may contribute to the widespread perception among medical policy decision-makers in the United States that there is a 'lack of consensus for appropriate cut-off values for FC'.

### Faecal calprotectin level for assessing endoscopic activity and predicting future clinical course in patients with moderately active ulcerative colitis undergoing granulomonocytapheresis: a prospective cohort study [^113aHbis]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We found that FC, which is convenient to measure in patients with IBD could become a validated biomarker for the assessment of endoscopic disease activity in UC patients undergoing GMA therapy. Further, FC at the end of GMA treatment course appeared to be a relevant biomarker for the prediction of clinical relapse in patients who had achieved remission. Further, FC measurement is a relatively low-cost approach to monitor intestinal inflammation, and should spare patients from invasive and time-consuming endoscopic procedures. Our FC levels appeared to be lower compared with previous studies in which different FC assays were used. Additional, well designed, prospective, controlled trials with standardisation in FC measurements should strengthen our findings. Future studies should investigate whether early medical intervention can prevent subsequent relapse in patients with elevated FC.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of ulcerative colitis [^115vxZFw]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Fecal calprotectin thresholds in ulcerative colitis are addressed, and the guideline panel felt choosing a single fecal calprotectin cutpoint (< 150 μg/g) is preferable for broad clinical use, while in patients who have recently achieved symptomatic remission after treatment adjustment in the preceding 1–3 months a lower fecal calprotectin < 50 μg/g may be more accurate than < 150 μg/g to rule out moderate to severe active inflammation; in children 2 years or younger, a higher threshold may be needed. The panel did not compare different noninvasive biomarkers due to variable cutoffs, and notes that stool-based tests may be more sensitive for intestinal inflammation compared with serum CRP, although CRP has the convenience of being a blood test.
