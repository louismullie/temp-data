## Question

why not use ondansetron in malignant bowel obstruction

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why ondansetron should not be used in malignant bowel obstruction and what the rationale is for avoiding it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of malignant bowel obstruction and how that influences antiemetic choice. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about ondansetron in MBO. Next, I will examine the FDA labeling warnings that specifically mention masking of ileus and gastric distension. After that, I need to check whether there is any direct clinical evidence for ondansetron in MBO and compare it to alternatives like granisetron. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant approach and confirm safety considerations before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and pathophysiology. Malignant bowel obstruction is common in advanced abdominal and pelvic cancers, often multifactorial, and may be partial or complete; symptoms include nausea, vomiting, distension, and pain, driven by mechanical blockage, impaired motility, and accumulation of secretions, which together shape the pharmacologic strategy for palliation [^116KbShY] [^116m8dBA].

> Wait, let me verify what the major guidelines actually recommend for antiemetics in MBO. MASCC 2022 and ESMO 2021 emphasize antisecretory therapy with somatostatin analogs, consider dopamine antagonists only in partial obstruction, and list several antiemetic classes for symptom control, but notably do not recommend ondansetron for MBO; instead, they suggest granisetron as a 5‑HT3 antagonist option, haloperidol, olanzapine, and H1 antagonists depending on obstruction type and severity [^111C963Y] [^115Bg2Y2] [^1141LK7x] [^117XeDLd] [^111fqSJt].

> Hold on, I should verify the FDA labeling because it often contains practical cautions relevant to obstruction. Multiple ondansetron labels carry a boxed or prominent warning that ondansetron may mask progressive ileus and gastric distension and explicitly state it should not be used instead of nasogastric suction; this masking risk is precisely the concern in suspected or evolving bowel obstruction where clinical deterioration could be obscured [^112tQFSY] [^1167Hajn] [^115aAHV9] [^115U3hNt].

> I need to check whether there is direct clinical evidence for ondansetron in MBO. I should double-check the MASCC evidence summaries: the only 5‑HT3 antagonist studied in MBO is granisetron, which showed benefit in a phase II trial, whereas ondansetron is not included in MASCC's MBO antiemetic recommendations or evidence tables, indicating a lack of supportive data for ondansetron in this setting [^114Cu9wM] [^113z6HEc].

> Let me consider mechanistic plausibility. Ondansetron blocks 5‑HT3 receptors centrally and peripherally, reducing emesis, but it does not promote motility or reduce secretions; in MBO, the priority is to decrease secretory load and distension with antisecretory agents like octreotide and to avoid prokinetics in complete obstruction, so ondansetron's mechanism does not address the core drivers of vomiting in MBO and may suppress warning signs of worsening obstruction [^114RDSdZ] [^111C963Y].

> But wait, what if granisetron is a 5‑HT3 antagonist too — doesn't that contradict avoiding ondansetron? Hmm, wait a minute, the distinction is that granisetron has at least supportive phase II data in MBO and is explicitly suggested by MASCC, whereas ondansetron lacks MBO-specific evidence and carries a label warning about masking ileus; thus, the evidentiary and safety profiles diverge despite shared class, so I should not overgeneralize across all 5‑HT3 antagonists in MBO [^115Bg2Y2] [^114Cu9wM] [^112tQFSY].

> I should confirm the practical, guideline-concordant approach. For MBO, use octreotide as the antisecretory backbone, add haloperidol or olanzapine for antiemetic effect, consider granisetron if additional 5‑HT3 blockade is needed, reserve metoclopramide only for carefully selected partial obstructions, and avoid prokinetics entirely in complete obstruction; importantly, in complete obstruction, administer all medications parenterally or subcutaneously given impaired absorption [^111C963Y] [^111pcqum] [^1122UQg5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety without reviewing other risks. Ondansetron has QT prolongation risk and potential serotonin syndrome, which can complicate management in medically fragile patients with advanced cancer; while these are not unique to MBO, they add to the risk burden in a population where masking of obstruction could delay escalation of care or procedural intervention [^1167Hajn] [^115aAHV9] [^115XWtFY].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line: ondansetron should be avoided in MBO because it lacks supportive evidence, may mask progressive ileus or gastric distension per FDA labeling, and does not address the secretory pathophysiology that drives vomiting in obstruction; guideline-preferred strategies prioritize antisecretory therapy and agents with MBO-specific evidence or favorable safety profiles in this context, such as octreotide, haloperidol, olanzapine, and granisetron when indicated [^112tQFSY] [^114RDSdZ] [^1141LK7x] [^111Nmbrg] [^115Bg2Y2].

---

Ondansetron is not recommended for malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) because it **masks progressive ileus and gastric distension** [^112tQFSY] by suppressing nausea and vomiting without addressing the underlying obstruction, which can delay recognition of clinical deterioration [^115U3hNt]. It also **does not reduce secretions or improve motility**, so it does not target the core pathophysiology of MBO [^114RDSdZ]. Guidelines favor antisecretory agents (e.g. octreotide) [^1122UQg5], dopamine antagonists for partial obstruction [^111C963Y], and haloperidol or H1 antagonists for complete obstruction [^111vKaF2]; ondansetron is not included in MBO-specific recommendations [^111vKaF2]. Use of ondansetron in MBO may therefore provide only transient symptom relief while obscuring the need for definitive intervention.

---

## Pathophysiology of malignant bowel obstruction

MBO is characterized by **mechanical blockage** of the bowel lumen due to tumor infiltration, extrinsic compression, or adhesions, leading to accumulation of gas, fluid, and secretions proximal to the obstruction [^116YgSsJ]. This accumulation causes **distension, pain, nausea, and vomiting** [^116m8dBA]. The pathophysiology involves:

- **Accumulation of secretions**: Gastric, pancreatic, and biliary secretions accumulate proximal to the obstruction, causing distension and vomiting [^114RDSdZ].

- **Impaired motility**: The normal peristaltic movements of the bowel are disrupted, leading to stasis and further accumulation of contents [^116YgSsJ].

- **Inflammation and edema**: The bowel wall becomes inflamed and edematous, exacerbating the obstruction and symptoms [^116YgSsJ].

---

## Mechanism of action of ondansetron

Ondansetron is a selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist that blocks serotonin receptors in the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract, thereby reducing nausea and vomiting. It is effective for chemotherapy- and radiation-induced nausea and vomiting and for postoperative nausea and vomiting [^115tfRUo]. However, ondansetron **does not address the underlying mechanical obstruction** or the accumulation of secretions and gas in the bowel [^112tQFSY].

---

## Limitations of ondansetron in malignant bowel obstruction

### Masking of progressive ileus and gastric distension

Ondansetron can **mask progressive ileus and gastric distension** by suppressing nausea and vomiting, delaying recognition of clinical deterioration and potentially postponing necessary interventions such as nasogastric decompression or surgery [^112tQFSY] [^1167Hajn].

---

### Lack of effect on secretion reduction and motility

Ondansetron **does not reduce gastrointestinal secretions** or improve bowel motility, which are critical factors in managing MBO [^112tQFSY]. The accumulation of secretions and gas continues despite symptomatic relief, perpetuating the underlying obstruction [^112tQFSY].

---

### Potential for delayed intervention

By masking symptoms, ondansetron may lead to **delayed recognition of worsening obstruction**, increasing the risk of complications such as bowel perforation, ischemia, and sepsis [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus statements **do not recommend ondansetron as a first-line antiemetic** for MBO. Instead, they emphasize the following:

- **Antisecretory agents**: Octreotide, a somatostatin analog, is recommended to reduce gastrointestinal secretions and vomiting in MBO [^1122UQg5] [^114RDSdZ].

- **Dopamine antagonists**: Metoclopramide or domperidone may be considered in partial obstruction to restore bowel transit time, but should be avoided in complete obstruction due to the risk of perforation [^111C963Y] [^112nPd4R].

- **Haloperidol and H1 antagonists**: Haloperidol and histamine H1 antagonists (e.g. dimenhydrinate, cyclizine) are recommended for nausea and vomiting, particularly in complete obstruction [^117XeDLd] [^114VidJa].

- **Granisetron**: Granisetron, another 5-HT3 antagonist, has been suggested in some guidelines, but evidence is limited and further studies are needed [^114Cu9wM] [^113DrNeQ].

---

## Alternative pharmacological management strategies

Effective management of MBO requires a **multimodal approach** that addresses the underlying pathophysiology:

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Mechanism of action** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Antisecretory agents | Octreotide, lanreotide | Reduce gastrointestinal secretions | Effective in reducing vomiting and distension [^114RDSdZ] |
| Dopamine antagonists | Metoclopramide, domperidone | Prokinetic agents | Useful in partial obstruction; avoid in complete obstruction [^111C963Y] [^112nPd4R] |
| Antipsychotics | Haloperidol, olanzapine | Antiemetic properties | Effective in complete obstruction [^114VidJa] |
| H1 antagonists | Dimenhydrinate, cyclizine | Antiemetic properties | Effective in complete obstruction [^117XeDLd] [^116oBx3o] |
| Corticosteroids | Dexamethasone | Anti-inflammatory | May reduce edema and improve symptoms [^115F3rPW] |

---

## Clinical outcomes and patient safety considerations

Using ondansetron in MBO may provide **transient symptom relief** but does not address the underlying obstruction, potentially leading to delayed interventions and increased risk of complications. Clinicians should prioritize therapies that target the pathophysiology of MBO and provide sustained symptom control [^112tQFSY].

---

Ondansetron is **not recommended for malignant bowel obstruction** because it masks symptoms without addressing the underlying obstruction, potentially delaying necessary interventions. Clinicians should use antisecretory agents, dopamine antagonists (in partial obstruction), and haloperidol or H1 antagonists (in complete obstruction) to manage MBO effectively [^1122UQg5] [^111C963Y] [^117XeDLd].

### Medical management of inoperable malignant bowel obstruction [^1173YuHE]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review medical management of inoperable malignant bowel obstruction.

Data Sources

A literature review using PubMed and MEDLINE databases searching malignant bowel obstruction, etiology, types, pathophysiology, medical, antisecretory, anti-inflammatory, antiemetic drugs, analgesics, promotion of emptying, prevention of infection, anticholinergics, somatostatin analogs, gastric antisecretory drugs, prokinetic agents, glucocorticoid, opioid analgesics, antibiotics, enema, and adverse effects.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Randomized or observational studies, cohorts, case reports, or reviews written in English between 1983 and November 2020 were evaluated.

Data Synthesis

Malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) commonly occurs in patients with advanced or recurrent malignancies and severely affects the quality of life and survival of patients. Its management remains complex and variable. Medical management is the cornerstone of MBO treatment, with the goal of reducing distressing symptoms and optimizing quality of life. Until now, there has been neither a standard clinical approach nor registered medications to treat patients with inoperable MBO.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

This review provides information on the etiology, type and pathophysiology, and medical treatment of MBO and related adverse reactions of the drugs commonly used, which can greatly assist clinicians in making clinical decisions when treating MBO.

Conclusions

Published research shows that medical management of MBO mainly consists of antisecretory, anti-inflammatory strategies, controlling vomiting and pain, promoting emptying, preventing infection, and combination therapy. Being knowledgeable about the most current treatment options, the related adverse effects, and the evidence supporting different practices is critical for clinicians to provide individualized medical therapy for MBO patients.

### Aggressive pharmacological treatment for reversing malignant bowel obstruction [^1119A1DT]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2004). Low credibility.

Early and intensive pharmacological treatment not only may reduce gastrointestinal symptoms but also reverse malignant bowel obstruction. Fifteen consecutive advanced cancer patients with inoperable bowel obstruction received a combination of drugs including metoclopramide, octreotide, dexamethasone and an initial bolus of amidotrizoato. Recovery of intestinal transit was reported within 1–5 days in fourteen patients, who continued this treatment without presenting symptoms of bowel obstruction until death. This case series establishes that the combination of propulsive and antisecretive agents can act synergistically to allow a fast recovery of bowel transit without inducing unpleasant colic. It suggests that the most important mechanism in these circumstances is functional and can be reversible, if an aggressive treatment is initiated early before fecal impaction and edema render bowel obstruction irreversible.

### Considerations in the management of malignant bowel obstruction [^1177DwjH]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Malignant bowel obstruction is a challenging clinical problem encountered in patients with advanced abdominal and pelvic malignancies. Although medical therapies form the foundation of management, some patients may be suitable candidates for surgical and procedural interventions. The literature is composed primarily of retrospective single-institution experiences and the results of prospective trials are pending. Given the high symptom burden and limited life expectancy of these patients, management may be best informed by multidisciplinary teams with relevant expertise.

Serotonin (5-HT 3) antagonists

Suggestion: Granisetron, serotonin (5HT 3) antagonist may reduce nausea and the frequency of vomiting in MBO (level of evidence: III; grade D).

Serotonin (5-HT 3) antagonists act on receptors located in the chemoreceptor trigger zone to reduce nausea and vomiting. The review identified only one study published in 2009 that examined the use of a 5-HT 3 antagonist, granisetron, for MBO management. This study was a phase II clinical trial that found granisetron, in addition to dexamethasone and as-needed haloperidol, significantly reduced the severity of nausea (p < 0.001) and a number of episodes of vomiting (p < 0.001) before and after treatment. However, the reported incidence of constipation associated with granisetron ranges from 3 to 18%. Further studies are required to assess its use in MBO.

Analgesics for malignant bowel obstruction — Pain is experienced by 70 to 90% of patients with MBO. The WHO Guidelines for the Pharmacologic and Radiotherapeutic Management of Cancer Pain in Adults and Adolescents recommend that analgesics should be given by mouth whenever possible. However, patients with MBO often have significant nausea and vomiting and malfunctioning gastrointestinal tracts that prevent ingestion and absorption of oral analgesics; consequently, the parenteral (subcutaneous or intravenous) and/or transdermal routes of administration should be considered for this population to deliver effective analgesia, and a comparison of subcutaneous and intravenous routes found no differences, confirming both routes as feasible, effective, and safe.

### What is the evidence for dietary modification in the management and prevention of malignant bowel obstruction? A scoping review [^111FakFj]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) is a common complication in advanced malignancy, particularly in gynaecological and gastrointestinal tumours that spread within the abdominal cavity. MBO affects up to 51% of patients with recurrent gynaecological cancers, and malignant obstructions of the small bowel are more prevalent than large bowel obstructions.

MBO typically presents as colicky abdominal pain, distention, nausea and bilious vomiting, and an inability to pass wind or stool. This occurs due to either a functional or mechanical obstruction, the aetiology and pathophysiology of which are well described elsewhere. MBO is often recurrent with symptoms increasing in severity and frequency over time, until, without surgical intervention, obstruction becomes a permanent state. This results in frequent, protracted hospital admissions, with significant burden both for patients and healthcare services. In addition to diminishing well-being and quality of life (QoL), patients with MBO have reported lack of attention to nutritional problems, fear of starvation and unmet supportive care needs.

### Pharmacologic management of malignant bowel obstruction: when surgery is not an option [^116qDTVV]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) complicates 3%-15% of cancers and often necessitates inpatient admission. Hospitalists are increasingly involved in treating patients with MBO and coordinating their care across multiple subspecialties. Direct resolution of the obstruction via surgical or interventional means is always preferable. When such options are not possible, pharmacological treatments are the mainstay of therapy. Medications such as somatostatin analogs, steroids, H2-blockers, and other modalities can be effective in palliation and possible resolution of obstruction. Awareness of these pharmacologic therapies can aid hospitalists in treating patients who are confronted with this devastating condition.

### Current concepts in malignant bowel obstruction management [^111Rtio9]. Current Oncology Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) is a challenging complication of advanced cancer. Several pathophysiologic mechanisms are responsible for the syndrome, including mechanical compression, motility disorders, gastrointestinal secretion accumulation, decreased gastrointestinal absorption, and inflammation. The treatment of related symptoms requires a collaborative approach of surgical, interventional, and medical specialists. The surgical approach proves beneficial in selected patients with operable lesions, life expectancy greater than 2 months, and good performance status. Interventionalists place self-expanding metallic stents as a minimally invasive palliative method either as a definitive treatment or as a bridge to surgery. However, most patients with MBO are not candidates for surgery or stent placement. Medical management with opioids, antispasmodics, antiemetics, antisecretory agents, and corticosteroids is effective in controlling the symptoms associated with MBO. This article discusses the current understanding of MBO pathophysiology and emphasizes current MBO management concepts; it then reviews surgical, interventional, and medical approaches.

### Systematic review of the efficacy of antiemetics in the treatment of nausea in patients with far-advanced cancer [^116PZ7fg]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To systematically review studies of antiemetics used in the treatment of nausea in patients with far-advanced cancer.

Data Sources

Randomized controlled trials (RCT) and uncontrolled studies identified by electronic and hand searching.

Review Methods

Identified studies were appraised for quality and effect size.

Results

Of 21 studies included, 2 were systematic reviews, 7 were RCT and 12 were uncontrolled studies or case series. Differences in interventions and outcomes amongst the RCT precluded any quantitative data synthesis and all seven studies were prone to bias. Whereas uncontrolled studies indicated a high response rate to standard regimens (75–93% for both nausea and vomiting), RCT showed much lower response rates to these agents (23–36% for nausea, 18–52% for vomiting). The two methods of antiemetic choice (choice based either on the inferred mechanism or empirical) were equally effective. There is reasonably strong evidence for the use of metoclopramide in cancer-associated dyspepsia and steroids in malignant bowel obstruction. There was conflicting evidence about the efficacy of serotonin antagonists compared with standard treatments (e.g. metoclopramide, dopamine antagonists and dexamethasone). There was little or no evidence of the efficacy of some commonly used and seemingly effective drugs such as haloperidol, cyclizine, and methotrimeprazine.

Conclusion

Evidence supporting the existing consensus-based guidelines for management of nausea and vomiting in advanced cancer is sparse. Current approaches to treatment based on the neuropharmacology of the emetic pathway may be inappropriate in this setting. Well-designed studies of the impact of "standard" management and novel agents on nausea and vomiting in palliative populations are needed.

### Medical management of malignant bowel obstruction in patients with advanced cancer: 2021 MASCC guideline update [^111dAeQf]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) is a frequent complication in patients with advanced cancer, particularly colon or gynecological malignancies. MASCC previously published a guideline for symptom management of MBO in 2017. This is a 5-year update.

Method

A systematic search and review of relevant literature includes a review published in 2010 and 2017. The guideline update used the same literature search process as followed in 2015. The dates of the new search included 2015 up to February 2, 2021. The guidelines involved the pharmacologic management of nausea and vomiting in malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) only. Only randomized trials were included in the updated guideline as evidence. The evidence was reviewed by the panel and the MASCC criteria for establishing a guideline were followed using MASCC level of grading and category of evidence.

Results

There was one systematic review and 3 randomized trials accepted as evidence from 257 abstracts. Octreotide is effective in reducing gastrointestinal secretions and colic and thereby reduces nausea and vomiting caused by MBO. Scopolamine butylbromide is inferior to octreotide in the doses used in the comparison study. Olanzapine or metoclopramide may be effective in reducing nausea and vomiting secondary to partial bowel obstructions. The panel suggests using either drug. Additional studies are needed to clarify benefits. Haloperidol has been used by convention as an antiemetic but has not been subjected to a randomized comparison. Ranitidine plus dexamethasone may be effective in reducing nausea and vomiting from MBO but cannot be recommended until there is a comparison with octreotide.

Discussion

Octreotide remains the drug of choice in managing MBO. Ranitidine was used in one randomized trial in all participants and so its effectiveness as a single drug is not known until there is a randomized comparison with octreotide. Antiemetics such as metoclopramide and olanzapine may be effective, but we have very few randomized trials of antiemetics in MBO.

Conclusion

The panel recommends octreotide in non-operable MBO. Randomized trials are needed to clarify ranitidine and antiemetic choices.

Suggestions/recommendations

The following sections present each MBO management recommendation and its associated evidence (Table 3). In complete MBO, medication should be administered intravenously or subcutaneously if available.

Table 3
Summary of suggestions and recommendations for MBO management, with associated level and grade of evidence

Anti-emetics

The 2021 MASCC guideline about select pharmacologic management of nausea and vomiting in MBO was released in August 2021 as an update to a previous guideline published in 2017. The following sections and Appendix B provide suggestions/recommendations for all anti-emetic drug classes reportedly used for MBO management and their associated existing evidence:

Anticholinergics

Suggestion: The benefit of anticholinergics (hyoscine butylbromide) may be inferior to octreotide to reduce vomiting in MBO. (Level of evidence: III; Grade: D).

Hyoscine (scopolamine) butylbromide is an anticholinergic agent that reduces gastrointestinal secretions. A 2016 systematic review identified four randomized clinical trials with high Cochrane risk of bias that found somatostatin analog (e.g. octreotide) were more effective than hyoscine butylbromide in reducing nausea and vomiting. Three case reports reported mixed findings, where two reported hyoscine butylbromide in combination with other drugs (e.g. octreotide, dexamethasone) was effective in reducing vomiting, and one that reported that it was ineffective for controlling vomiting. Since the publication of that review, no new randomized clinical trials have been published. An alternative anticholinergic that can reportedly be used is glycopyrrolate. However, this review only identified one case report that reported that glycopyrrolate reduced nausea and vomiting in MBO. Appendix B presents the characteristics of all included studies about anticholinergic use in MBO.

Butyrophenone antipsychotic

Suggestion: Haloperidol, a butyrophenone antipsychotic, may be an effective anti-emetic in MBO, particularly for complete MBO (level of evidence: IV; grade: B),

Butyrophenone antipsychotics are commonly used as anti-psychotics for delirium management but are also used for the management of nausea and vomiting in MBO. The main butyrophenone used is haloperidol. The review identified two cross-sectional studies and two case reports/series that reported on haloperidol's use in MBO. All studies suggested that haloperidol effectively relieve nausea and vomiting in MBO and is the preferred anti-emetic in complete BO.

### Can malignant bowel obstruction in advanced cancer patients be treated at home? [^117CPY5E]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Eleven advanced cancer patients affected by malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) were treated at home with a combination of octreotide, metoclopramide, morphine, and dexamethasone. In all patients, we observed a prompt control of gastrointestinal symptoms and recovery of bowel movements within 1–5 days. Based on our results, a combination of drugs with different mechanisms of action allows an effective and safe treatment for MBO at home. Further studies with larger number of patients are warranted to confirm these preliminary data.

### 2016 updated MASCC / ESMO consensus recommendations: management of nausea and vomiting in advanced cancer [^1156zzzL]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this paper is to review the existing literature related to the management of nausea and vomiting (N & V) in advanced cancer and derive clinical evidence-based recommendations for its management.

Methods

Available systematic reviews on antiemetic drug effectiveness were used. One generic systematic review of antiemetics in advanced cancer (to 2009) was updated to February 2016. Agreement on recommendations was reached between panel members, and these were voted in favor unanimously by the larger antiemetic committee membership (n = 37).

Results

The evidence base in this field is minimal with largely poor quality trials or uncontrolled trials and case studies. The level of evidence in most studies is low. The drug of choice for managing N & V in advanced cancer is metoclopramide titrated to effect. Alternative options include haloperidol, levomepromazine, or olanzapine. For bowel obstruction, the recommendation is to use octreotide given alongside an antiemetic (haloperidol) and where octreotide is not an option to use an anticholinergic antisecretory agent. For opioid-induced N & V, no recommendation could be made.

Conclusion

These new guidelines, based on the existing (but poor) evidence, could help clinicians manage more effectively the complex and challenging symptoms of N & V in advanced cancer.

Purpose

To provide evidence-based recommendations on the management of malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) for patients with advanced cancer.

Methods

The Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) MBO study group conducted a systematic review of databases (inception to March 2021) to identify studies about patients with advanced cancer and MBO that reported on the following outcomes: symptom management, bowel obstruction resolution, prognosis, overall survival, and quality of life. The review was restricted to studies published in English, but no restrictions were placed on publication year, country, and study type. As per the MASCC Guidelines Policy, the findings were synthesized to determine the levels of evidence to support each MBO intervention and, ultimately, the graded recommendations and suggestions.

Results

The systematic review identified 17,656 published studies and 397 selected for the guidelines. The MASCC study group developed a total of 25 evidence-based suggestions and recommendations about the management of MBO-related nausea and vomiting, bowel movements, pain, inflammation, bowel decompression, and nutrition. Expert consensus-based guidance about advanced care planning and psychosocial support is also provided.

Conclusion

This MASCC Guideline provides comprehensive, evidence-based recommendations about MBO management for patients with advanced cancer.

### A systematic review of the treatment of nausea and / or vomiting in cancer unrelated to chemotherapy or radiation [^117TdjXU]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2010). Low credibility.

Context

A systematic review of antiemetics for emesis in cancer unrelated to chemotherapy and radiation is an important step in establishing treatment recommendations and guiding future research. Therefore, a systematic review based on the question "What is the evidence that supports antiemetic choices in advanced cancer?" guided this review.

Objectives

To determine the level of evidence for antiemtrics in the management of nausea and vomiting in advanced cancer unrelated to chemotherapy and radiation, and to discover gaps in the evidence, which would provide important areas for future research.

Methods

Three databases and independent searches using different MeSH terms were performed. Related links were searched and hand searches of related articles were made. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective single-drug studies, studies that used guidelines based on the etiology of emesis, cohort studies, retrospective studies, and case series or single-patient reports. Studies that involved treatment of chemotherapy, radiation, or postoperation-related emesis were excluded. Studies that involved the treatment of emesis related to bowel obstruction were included. The strength of evidence was graded as follows: 1) RCTs, A; 2) single-drug prospective studies, B1; 3) studies based on multiple drug choices for etiology of emesis, B2; and 4) cohort, case series, retrospective, and single-patient reports, E. Level of evidence was determined by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Levels of Evidence (May 2001) (A, B, C, D).

Results

Ninety-three articles were found. Fourteen were RCTs, most of them of low quality, based either on lack of blinding, lack of description of the method of randomization, concealment, and/or attrition. Metoclopramide had modest evidence (B) based on RCTs and prospective cohort studies. Octreotide, dexamethasone, and hyoscine butylbromide are effective in reducing symptoms of bowel obstruction, based on prospective studies and/or one RCT. There was no evidence that either multiple antiemetics or antiemetic choices based on the etiology of emesis were any better than a single antiemetic. There is poor evidence for dose response, intraclass or interclass drug switch, or antiemetic combinations in those individuals failing to respond to the initial antiemetic.

Conclusion

There are discrepancies between antiemetic studies and published antiemetic guidelines, which are largely based on expert opinion. Antiemetic recommendations have moderate to weak evidence at best. Prospective randomized trials of single antiemetics are needed to properly establish evidence-based guidelines.

### Evidence-based recommendations for cancer nausea and vomiting [^117QMDPn]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

The experience of patients living with cancer and being treated with chemotherapy often includes the symptoms of nausea and vomiting. To provide a framework for high-quality management of these symptoms, we developed a set of key targeted evidence-based standards through an iterative process of targeted systematic review, development, and refinement of topic areas and standards and consensus ratings by a multidisciplinary expert panel as part of the RAND Cancer Quality-Assessing Symptoms Side Effects and Indicators of Supportive Treatment Project. For nausea and vomiting, key clinical standards included screening at the initial outpatient and inpatient visit, prophylaxis for acute and delayed emesis in patients receiving moderate to highly emetic chemotherapy, and follow-up after treatment for nausea and vomiting symptoms. In addition, patients with cancer and small bowel obstruction were examined as a special subset of patients who present with nausea and vomiting. The standards presented here for preventing and managing nausea and vomiting in cancer care should be incorporated into care pathways and should become the expectation rather than the exception.

Instruct patients to immediately report any signs or symptoms consistent with a potential bowel obstruction to their healthcare provider [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4)].

Drug Interactions

Instruct the patient to report the use of all medications, especially apomorphine, to their healthcare provider. Concomitant use of apomorphine and ondansetron may cause a significant drop in blood pressure and loss of consciousness.

Advise patients of the possibility of serotonin syndrome with concomitant use of ondansetron and another serotonergic agent, such as medications to treat depression and migraines. Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if the following symptoms occur: changes in mental status, autonomic instability, neuromuscular symptoms with or without gastrointestinal symptoms [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)].

5.3 Serotonin Syndrome

The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3receptor antagonists alone. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of ondansetron tablets alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center.

Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of ondansetron tablets and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue ondansetron tablets and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if ondansetron tablets is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Overdosage (10)].

5.4 Masking of Progressive Ileus and Gastric Distension

The use of ondansetron tablets in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distension. Monitor for decreased bowel activity, particularly in patients with risk factors for gastrointestinal obstruction.

Ondansetron tablets are not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction.

Background

Etiology

MBO most frequently occurs when patients have advanced cancers that originate in the abdomen or pelvis. Though the incidence of MBO is not well established, based on retrospective and autopsy-based studies, MBO is estimated to occur in 10–28% of patients with gastrointestinal cancers and up to 51% of patients with advanced ovarian cancer. Limitations of these estimates include patient population selection and nonhomogeneous criteria to diagnose MBO.

The mechanisms of MBO development are multi-factorial and can be divided into two main groups: mechanical and functional obstruction. Causes of mechanical obstruction include extrinsic obstruction of the lumen by pathology, such as mesenteric and omental masses, adhesions, and fibrosis; intra-luminal obstruction from tumor growth in the bowel; and intra-mural obstruction by tumor within the bowel wall, which impairs motility. Whereas functional obstruction is a result of motility disorders, which can be due to tumor infiltration of mesentery, nerves and/or celiac and enteric plexus, and paraneoplastic syndromes. Further, nonmalignant factors may induce or worsen bowel obstruction (BO) in patients with advanced cancer, including constipation/fecal impaction, pharmacological (i.e. opioids, intra-peritoneal chemotherapy), fibrosis, and adhesions from prior surgery and radiotherapy.

Pathophysiology and symptoms

MBO can occur in the small or large bowel, with small BO being more common. The obstruction can be partial or complete and can occur at single or multiple transition points. MBO causes reduction or absence of movements of the intestinal content and bowel distension. The accumulation of content in the intestinal lumen increases the epithelial surface area and prompts an accumulation of gastric, pancreatic, biliary secretions, water, and salt, which damages the intestinal epithelium and triggers an inflammatory response with intestinal edema, hyperemia, and production of inflammatory mediators (i.e. prostaglandins, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and nociceptive mediators). Bacterial overgrowth and translocation are important mechanisms in the development of symptoms. The cumulative impact of these events results in abdominal pain, cramps, distention, nausea, vomiting, absence of gas and stool passage, and, occasionally, overflow diarrhea. MBO symptoms usually start gradually and become more frequent and severe when a complete obstruction occurs. Re-obstruction and malnutrition are common, with malnutrition being an independent predictor of poor survival in this population.

### MASCC multidisciplinary evidence-based recommendations for the management of malignant bowel obstruction in advanced cancer [^1115Kpzb]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

MBO is a significant complication for patients living with cancer. The approach should be multi and inter-disciplinary to improve the management of these patients and support their families. Studies indicate the need to improve the quality of research and subsequent interventions in this domain (refer to Table 3 for a summary of suggestions and recommendations). Communication around changing goals of care is essential to foster clear and decisive clinical decision making in partnership with patients and families. Further prospective and innovative studies are needed to improve the care for patients with MBO.

### What is the evidence for dietary modification in the management and prevention of malignant bowel obstruction? A scoping review [^1147GgSS]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This scoping review has highlighted a significant lack of relevant, high-quality studies providing evidence for the recommendation of dietary modification in the management of MBO. This reflects the challenges of designing an ethically sound clinical trial and controlling for confounding variables such as disease state, anti-cancer treatments and palliative care interventions. Despite this, dietary modification is a widely used approach, is referred to in clinical management guidelines and is common particularly in re-introduction of oral intake after a subacute bowel obstruction. Whilst we have found no strong evidence to support the use of a modified diet, and developing ethical, adequately powered, well-designed clinical trials in this field remains challenging, this does not mean that dietary modification is not beneficial in the multidisciplinary and holistic management of MBO.

### Reducing gastric secretions – a role for histamine 2 antagonists or proton pump inhibitors in malignant bowel obstruction? [^112YJgem]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Goals Of Work

Inoperable bowel obstructions are not uncommon in advanced cancer and are associated with a very poor prognosis. Symptom control includes reducing the frequency of vomiting by prescription of antisecretory medications. The most commonly used agents for this are either hyoscine butylbromide or octreotide. Either histamine 2 antagonists or proton pump inhibitors are sometimes recommended as adjuvants to reduce gastric secretions. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of histamine 2 antagonists and proton pump inhibitors and to objectively compare the effects of one agent over another.

Materials and Methods

Previously, electronic databases were searched for trials that compared ranitidine versus proton pump inhibitors in their effect on volume of gastric aspirates.

Results

Seven trials were included in a meta-analysis. Pooled outcomes suggest that both proton pump inhibitors and ranitidine reduce gastric volumes, but the most superior agent is ranitidine, which reduces the volume of gastric secretions by an average of 0.22 ml·kg⁻¹; 95% confidence interval 0.04 to 0.41.

Conclusions

Based on well-conducted studies, objective evidence exists that confirms ranitidine will decrease the volume of gastric aspirates. This forms a sound basis from which to develop further research aimed at improving the care of people with malignant bowel obstructions.

Somatostatin analog

Recommendation: Somatostatin analog (octreotide, lanreotide) may reduce vomiting in MBO (levels of evidence: I; grade A).

MBO can cause intestinal secretions to accumulate and contribute to bowel distention, resulting in nausea and vomiting. Octreotide is a somatostatin analog that reduces intestinal and pancreas secretion and gastrointestinal motility, biliary contraction, and intestinal edema. Octreotide may be administered by subcutaneous bolus or continuous subcutaneous infusion. Its duration of activity is approximately 6 to 12 h, with an average half-life elimination of 1.8 h, thus necessitating multiple daily dosing schedules. Given it has a short half-life, a long-acting depot formulation is available to be administered intramuscularly once a month. Furthermore, another somatostatin analog, lanreotide, is available as a long-acting depot formulation.

A 2016 systematic review of randomized control trials and quasi-randomized control trials, published between 1979 and 2016, identified seven studies that compared the effect of somatostatin analog with placebo and/or other pharmacologic agents (e.g. hyoscine butylbromide) on vomiting. A meta-analysis was not possible given the heterogeneity in study design, outcomes, and timing of endpoints. Of these seven studies, five studies with high Cochrane risk of bias found the somatostatin analog were more effective than hyoscine butylbromide and placebo for reducing vomiting. Whereas two studies with low Cochrane risk of bias found no significant difference in vomiting between somatostatin analog and placebo in their primary end points. A secondary analysis of a randomized control trial originally published in 2015 examined the health-related quality of life in patients with inoperable MBO and found no difference in quality-of-life scores.

Thienobenzodiazepene (second-generation) antipsychotic

Suggestion: Thienobenzodiazepene antipsychotic (e.g. olanzapine) may reduce nausea and vomiting in MBO (level of evidence: IV; grade: D).

Olanzapine is a second-generation thienobenzodiazepine antipsychotic that antagonizes serotonin 5-HT 3 and 5-HT 2c and dopamine D 2 receptors, which may be responsible for its anti-emetic effects. We identified one cross-sectional study, published in 2012, that found olanzapine reduced the average nausea scores and frequency of vomiting in patients with advanced cancer and partial BO.

### Palliative management of inoperable malignant bowel obstruction: prospective, open label, phase 2 study at an NCI comprehensive cancer center [^116SZdtK]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2024). Medium credibility.

Context

Malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) is a common complication of intra-abdominal cancer, frequently seen in advanced gastrointestinal and gynecologic cancer. Management of MBO can be challenging, particularly if the patient is not a surgical candidate. No consensus exists on how best to manage these patients medically. Retrospective studies suggest that the combination of dexamethasone, octreotide and metoclopramide may lead to relief of obstruction and improvement in symptoms associated with the obstruction.

Objectives

This study seeks to prospectively evaluate the combination of drug "triple therapy" dexamethasone 4 mg BID, metoclopramide 10 mg Q6 and octreotide 300 mcg TID to assess tolerability, safety, and effect on symptoms and deobstruction.

Methods

Adults admitted at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center with malignant bowel obstruction were eligible. Eligible patients who constented to the study were started on the triple therapy with close monitoring of symptoms and for adverse effects.

Results

A total of 15 patients enrolled in the study. Two patients experienced bradycardia as adverse effect and there was no incidence of bowel perforation. All patients who completed the study had complete resolution of their nausea, and improvement in other symptoms including pain, constipation, tolerance of oral intake and resumption of bowel movements. Only two of the 15 patients were alive to complete the six-month post study follow up.

Conclusion

"Triple therapy" with dexamethasone, metoclopramide, and octreotide for management of nonsurgical MBO in this small sample size appears safe and well tolerated however a diagnosis of inoperable MBO remains associated with poor prognosis and death within months.

### Optimal management of malignant left-sided large bowel obstruction: do international guidelines agree? [^113zPofQ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

International guidelines offer limited and contrasting recommendations on the management of left-sided MBO. There is a lack of high-quality evidence to support whether emergency surgery or stenting as a bridge to surgery is the best procedure with regards to morbidity, mortality and long-term oncological outcomes. Comparison of the guidelines is difficult as they are based on differing levels of evidence and a number require updating to consider the results of more recent randomised controlled trials. Furthermore, a number of guidelines fail to provide a formal evaluation of the evidence at all. This review provides a snapshot of current guidelines, and until high-quality research is available, the optimal management of this emergency surgical condition will continue to be debated.

### Efficacy of granisetron in the antiemetic control of nonsurgical intestinal obstruction in advanced cancer: a phase II clinical trial [^113z6HEc]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess antiemetic efficacy of granisetron in inoperable intestinal obstruction caused by advanced cancer. The study was open, prospective, and multi-centered. We assessed 24 patients (mean age: 61.3 years; 10 males, 14 females) with intestinal obstruction who were refractory to previous antiemetics. Obstruction involved the upper intestine in six patients, the lower intestine in three, and was at multiple levels in 15. Daily treatment included intravenous granisetron (3mg) and dexamethasone (8 mg); nasogastric drainage was not allowed. Subcutaneous haloperidol was available as rescue therapy. A numeric scale was used to evaluate nausea, pain, asthenia, and anorexia at baseline visit and every 24 hours up to the completion of four days of treatment (final visit). Treatment failure was defined as nausea > 4 on the numeric scale, vomiting 2/day or more, and rescue therapy with haloperidol at 5mg/day or more. Of the 24 patients, 23 were evaluable for efficacy. Evaluation pre- vs. post-treatment indicated a significant decrease in the severity of nausea (score 6.9 vs. 0.8; P < 0.001), number of episodes of vomiting (5.3 vs. 1.0; P < 0.001), and abdominal pain (score 4.4 vs. 1.2; P < 0.001). Nausea and vomiting control was achieved in 86.9% of patients. Although there was a trend toward greater efficacy in the lower and multiple levels of obstruction, the differences were not statistically significant owing, probably, to small sample size. We conclude that granisetron may be highly efficacious in the control of emesis resulting from intestinal obstruction caused by metastatic cancer, and can be used effectively in patients refractory to other antiemetics.

### Lidocaine infusion for malignant visceral pain: case report [^114GfLto]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2024). High credibility.

Case 2

A 66-year-old female patient with peritoneal carcinomatosis and rectovaginal fistula secondary to advanced ovarian cancer presented with symptoms of abdominal distension, vomiting and absence of stool. She had a history of partial intestinal obstruction. Radiological findings showed dilation of intestinal loops with non-incremental air-fluid levels, consistent with a diagnosis of MBO. Her numeric rating scale for pain was 8/10. She was managed conservatively with antiemetics, analgesics and bowel rest. Her symptoms improved with medical management, and she did not require surgery.

After the diagnosis of MBO, the initial medical management included the placement of a nasogastric tube, non-opioid analgesia, antisecretory and antiemetic drugs. Opioid analgesia was given on arrival but stopped shortly after due to dizziness and somnolence. In the case of patient #1, the surgical team was consulted and ruled out palliative surgery. Abdominal paracentesis was performed. For patient #2, the surgical team decided to perform a laparotomy, releasing the adhesions and resecting a retroperitoneal lesion. Medical treatment included ondansetron, haloperidol, scopolamine butylbromide, octreotide and opioids. However, despite optimal treatment, medical and surgical, neither patient #1 nor patient #2 had adequate pain control. In both cases, opioid dose increases were limited due to adverse effects, so it was mandatory to find alternative analgesic approaches.

Twenty-four hours after the lidocaine infusion began, patients experienced greater than a 50% reduction in their baseline pain score without the need for an increase in opioid dose. Patient #1 received 72 hours of lidocaine infusion, while patient #2 received 48 hours. Nausea, vomiting, and output from the nasogastric tube reduced which was subsequently removed. Oral intake improved for both patients, bowels moved and both could be discharged home. No complications during the infusion were reported. We propose that intravenous lidocaine may be beneficial for the management of malignant visceral pain. We believe the low dosage of opioids that our patients required was due to the lidocaine infusion and its effect on visceral hypersensitivity, which also helped reduce its side effects and probably aided in the rapid recovery of bowel transit.

### Nausea and vomiting: a palliative care imperative [^111hH98G]. Current Oncology Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review was undertaken to survey recent literature for research reports and comprehensive clinical reviews addressing the pharmacologic management of nausea and vomiting (N&V) in advanced cancer. The goal was to integrate findings in a comprehensive article that incorporates palliative care concepts into antiemetic treatment.

Recent Findings

There are few published studies of N&V in advanced cancer; such research may be limited by the multicausal nature of N&V and participant burden to patients with life-limiting disease. Most articles are written by oncologists who also specialize in palliative care, and those addressing adverse effects of drugs used as antiemetics are found in other literature. Articles addressing more novel therapies, like cannabinoids and medical marijuana, are uncommon in the oncology literature. N&V in patients with progressive or advanced cancer is often multicausal. Nausea is more common and persistent, and even mild nausea is bothersome and may cause anxiety or depression. The mechanisms of nausea and vomiting overlap, but different neural pathways constitute the final pathway for each-the brainstem for vomiting and higher brain regions for nausea. Common causes of N&V in advanced cancer include constipation, opioids, and malignant bowel obstruction. About 40% have undetermined causes and may be exacerbated by impaired gastric emptying, chemical imbalances, or other factors. Several drugs that have antiemetic effects and act at different receptors are used to palliate N&V. There is a paucity of research that supports palliative antiemetic choices, and other research is needed to define potential therapeutic strategies that capitalize on differences between nausea and vomiting.

Laxatives in malignant bowel obstruction — Suggestion: Oral osmotic laxatives should be considered in the management of impaired bowel movements in partial bowel obstruction but should be avoided in complete MBO (level of evidence: V; grade: D). If patients have complete MBO, the use of laxatives is not recommended. Whereas, if patients have partial BO, the cautious use of oral osmotic laxatives (e.g., polyethylene glycol 3350, also known as macrogol) can be used. The use of bulk-forming laxatives (e.g., psyllium) is not advised as they will increase stool consistency and potentially worsen BO. If a digital rectal examination identifies a full rectum or fecal impaction, suppositories and fecal disimpaction can be considered in partial MBO. However, enemas should be used with caution and are generally not recommended in MBO due to the risk of bowel perforation. Stool softeners (e.g., docusate) may be used, but their effect on bowel movement frequency is not well established.

Corticosteroids

Suggestion: The use of steroids may help with the acute symptoms of MBO and can be used for short-term benefit (level of evidence: III; grade: B).

The role of corticosteroids in MBO is complex, and the mechanism of action is not completely understood. Corticosteroids likely have an anti-inflammatory and anti-secretory effect, which may help decrease intestinal wall edema, promote salt and water absorption in MBO and, therefore, help with acute management of pain, nausea, and vomiting. Dexamethasone is generally the preferred corticosteroid given its potent anti-inflammatory effect and lack of sodium-retaining properties. The optimal dose of corticosteroids for MBO management is not well established. A dose between 4 and 16 mg of dexamethasone daily may be considered. In cases of no symptomatic improvement in 3 to 5 days, discontinuation should be considered.

Unselected and uncontrolled case series have reported a benefit of corticosteroids for the management of BO, yet it is challenging to attribute whether the resolution of MBO related symptoms is due to the medication or potential spontaneous resolution. Moreover, some of these reports look at combination strategies of corticosteroids with other therapies, which makes it challenging to attribute the resolution of MBO to the corticosteroid therapy per se. A retrospective cohort study retrieved information from a Japanese national medical claims database that included 3,090 adult patients with MBO treated with octreotide. Octreotide alone, in combination with H 2 antagonists, proton pump inhibitor, or corticosteroids, was administered in 53%, 14%, 11%, and 12% of patients, respectively. A secondary endpoint of the study was the assessment of nasogastric tube removal at 4 days. Of the 1595 patients who underwent a nasogastric tube insertion, those receiving corticosteroids with octreotide had a higher odds ratio (OR) of nasogastric tube removal within four days of insertion compared to those who did not receive corticosteroids (OR 1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08–1.23).

### Recommendations for bowel obstruction with peritoneal carcinomatosis [^114BiPj8]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2014). Low credibility.

This article reports on the clinical practice guidelines developed by a multidisciplinary group working on the indications and uses of the various available treatment options for relieving intestinal obstruction or its symptoms in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis. These guidelines are based on a literature review and expert opinion. The recommended strategy involves a clinical and radiological evaluation, of which CT of the abdomen is a crucial component. The results, together with an analysis of the prognostic criteria, are used to determine whether surgery or stenting is the best option. In most patients, however, neither option is feasible, and the main emphasis, therefore, is on the role and administration of various symptomatic medications such as glucocorticoids, antiemetic agents, analgesics, and antisecretory agents (anticholinergic drugs, somatostatin analogues, and proton-pump inhibitors). Nasogastric tube feeding is no longer used routinely and should instead be discussed on a case-by-case basis. Recent studies have confirmed the efficacy of somatostatin analogues in relieving obstruction-related symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and pain. However, the absence of a marketing license and the high cost of these drugs limit their use as the first-line treatment, except in highly selected patients (early recurrence). When these medications fail to alleviate the symptoms of obstruction, venting gastrostomy should be considered promptly. Rehydration is needed for virtually every patient. Parenteral nutrition and pain management should be adjusted according to the patient needs and guidelines.

Nausea and Vomiting

Nausea, defined as the unpleasant subjective feeling of wanting to vomit or retch, and/or vomiting, are experienced by as many as 68% of patients with cancer at some point during their illness; during the last 6 weeks of life, the prevalence of nausea and vomiting is 40% or more. Poorly controlled nausea and vomiting is associated with physical, cognitive, and psychosocial distress, and can contribute to patient and family fears of death from dehydration and/or starvation.

Nausea and vomiting secondary to antineoplastic agents or radiation therapy should be anticipated and managed according to ASCO antiemetic, or equivalent, clinical practice guidelines. The latest ASCO antiemetic update includes evidence-based recommendations and information on the appropriate use of olanzapine, neurokinin 1 receptor antagonists, and use of subcutaneous 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 receptor antagonists.

Much less trial evidence is available for the use of antiemetics in patients with advanced cancer and nausea and vomiting unrelated to antineoplastic agents or radiation therapy. Instead, an etiologic or mechanism-based approach to choosing an antiemetic is commonly recommended. This approach requires clinicians to take a detailed history and perform a focused examination to determine the most likely underlying cause(s) of the patient's nausea and vomiting. In the advanced cancer population, the most common underlying causes of nausea and vomiting are chemical abnormalities (eg, renal or liver failure, hyponatremia, hypercalcemia); drugs (eg, opioids, antidepressants, antibiotics); infection; and impaired gastric emptying, as well as visceral and serosal causes of delayed gastrointestinal transit (bowel obstruction, gastric bleed, enteritis, constipation). - Once the most likely underlying cause of the patient's nausea and vomiting is determined, an appropriate antiemetic can then be selected based on the pathophysiology and receptors implicated (Table 1).
