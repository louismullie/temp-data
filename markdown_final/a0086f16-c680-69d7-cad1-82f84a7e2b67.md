## Question

5.1. Evgeny is tiling the floor of his living room, which measures 12 by 16 meters. He plans to place 1 m $\times$ 1 m square tiles along the perimeter of the room, and the rest of the floor will be covered with 2 m $\times$ 2 m square tiles. How many tiles will he need in total?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many tiles are needed to cover a 12 m by 16 m living room, using 1 m × 1 m tiles along the perimeter and 2 m × 2 m tiles for the interior. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the total floor area and the area to be covered by 2 m × 2 m tiles. Then, I should verify the perimeter layout and count the 1 m × 1 m tiles without double-counting corners. Next, I will calculate the interior dimensions and the number of 2 m × 2 m tiles. Finally, I will sum the tiles and double-check for any off-by-one errors or overlaps that could affect the count.

> Let me first confirm the basics: the room is 12 m by 16 m, so the total area is 12 × 16 = 192 m², and I need to subtract the perimeter strip to find the interior area that will be tiled with 2 m × 2 m squares. Wait, let me verify the perimeter concept before I proceed, because I need to ensure I'm not mixing linear and area measures. The perimeter is 2 × (12 + 16) = 56 m, but that is a length, not an area; the perimeter tiles will occupy a 1 m wide strip around the edge, so I should calculate the area of that strip and then the remaining interior rectangle.

> I will now examine the perimeter tiling. A 1 m wide border around a 12 m × 16 m room leaves an interior rectangle of 10 m × 14 m, since I remove 1 m from each side. Hold on, I should verify that subtraction: 12 − 2 = 10 m and 16 − 2 = 14 m, so the interior is indeed 10 m × 14 m. The area of the perimeter strip is therefore 192 − 140 = 52 m², which will be covered by 1 m × 1 m tiles, implying 52 tiles if there were no overlaps or special handling at corners. But wait, I need to check the corner logic, because the four corner 1 m × 1 m tiles are shared by two walls and could be double-counted if I simply multiply perimeter length by width. Let me reconsider: the correct way is to count the perimeter tiles as two strips of 16 m and two strips of 12 m, each 1 m wide, and then subtract the four 1 m × 1 m corner squares that were counted twice, so total perimeter tiles = 16 + 16 + 12 + 12 − 4 = 52 tiles, which matches the area calculation and confirms 52 perimeter tiles.

> Next, I should review the interior tiling. The interior rectangle is 10 m × 14 m, and each interior tile is 2 m × 2 m, so I need to divide each dimension by 2 and multiply the results. 10 ÷ 2 = 5 and 14 ÷ 2 = 7, so 5 × 7 = 35 interior tiles. Hold on, I should verify that 10 and 14 are both divisible by 2; yes, they are, so there is no partial tile issue here, and 35 tiles will exactly cover the interior.

> Now, I will sum the tiles. Total tiles = perimeter tiles + interior tiles = 52 + 35 = 87 tiles. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the perimeter might be 56 tiles if I naively multiplied 56 m by 1 m, but that would ignore the corner overlap; correcting for that, 52 perimeter tiles plus 35 interior tiles gives 87 total tiles, which is the final answer.

Evgeny will need **87 tiles** in total: **52 perimeter tiles** (1 m × 1 m) and **35 interior tiles** (2 m × 2 m). The perimeter tiles cover the outer 1-meter strip around the 12 m × 16 m room, and the interior tiles cover the remaining 10 m × 14 m area.

---

## Step-by-step calculation

### 1. Total area of the living room

The total area of the living room is:

[
12, \\text{m} \\times 16, \\text{m} = 192, \\text{m}^2
]

---

### 2. Area covered by perimeter tiles

The perimeter tiles form a 1-meter-wide border around the room. The inner dimensions after removing the border are:

[
(12–2), \\text{m} \\times (16–2), \\text{m} = 10, \\text{m} \\times 14, \\text{m} = 140, \\text{m}^2
]

Thus, the area covered by the perimeter tiles is:

[
192, \\text{m}^2–140, \\text{m}^2 = 52, \\text{m}^2
]

Since each perimeter tile is 1 m × 1 m, the number of perimeter tiles is:

[
\\frac{52, \\text{m}^2}{1, \\text{m}^2/\\text{tile}} = 52, \\text{tiles}
]

---

### 3. Area covered by interior tiles

The interior area to be covered by 2 m × 2 m tiles is **140 m²**. Each interior tile covers:

[
2, \\text{m} \\times 2, \\text{m} = 4, \\text{m}^2
]

Therefore, the number of interior tiles is:

[
\\frac{140, \\text{m}^2}{4, \\text{m}^2/\\text{tile}} = 35, \\text{tiles}
]

---

### 4. Total number of tiles

The total number of tiles is the sum of perimeter and interior tiles:

[
52, \\text{tiles} + 35, \\text{tiles} = 87, \\text{tiles}
]

---

## Final answer

Evgeny will need a total of **87 tiles**: 52 perimeter tiles and 35 interior tiles.

### Forest fire size amplifies postfire land surface warming [^042b6100]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Nonetheless, the omission of the burnt area by MCD61A1 in boreal regions probably leads to the underestimation of fire size, which is confirmed by comparing the GFA with three regional fire patch datasets of higher quality than the GFA for Canadian and Alaskan boreal forests (Supplementary Note 1). The first two regional datasets cover both Canadian and Alaskan forests and were generated by the Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) project by combining fire perimeter information from the Alaskan Interagency Coordination Center and Natural Resources Canada with either burn severity information derived from Landsat images (ABoVE-Landsat) or with the burn date information from the MODIS MCD14ML active fire product (ABoVE-MODIS). The third dataset covers Alaska only and was obtained from the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) project, which is based on Landsat images. These three datasets are not subject to the omission/commission errors associated with MCD64A1. The major conclusion of this study — that the forest fire size amplifies postfire surface warming — was tested using these high-quality fire patch datasets and found to be robust (Supplementary Note 1).

The GFA is also known to erroneously divide a single fire patch spanning two MODIS tiles (each tile covering a 10° × 10° region) into two patches. However, our analysis revealed that fire patches subject to this error accounted for negligible percentages of the total number of fires and total burnt area (Supplementary Note 5). The analysis in this study was complemented by a comparison of the results based on the GFA with those based on another MCD64A1-based fire patch dataset (GlobFire), which is free of tiling error. This comparison showed consistent results derived using the two datasets, confirming the negligible influence of the tiling error in the GFA on our key findings (Supplementary Note 5).

### Study protocol: effect of playful training on functional abilities of older adults-a randomized controlled trial [^f92b1c86]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Study settings

In Denmark, care for the elderly by the municipalities consists of many different services. Care is given in form of nursing homes, day centers and care at the private homes depending on the elderly and their abilities. The care is granted by the municipalities, and is an ongoing negotiation on the amount of money for elderly care and other services provided by the municipalities.

Activities for elderly consist of volunteer activities such as gymnastics (local teams often with public support), day centers where elderly is screened and appointed to, or rehabilitation normally after operations or hospitalization. In a recent study, elderly at a day center participated in exercising with playware technology.

In this study, the participants will be participating in training at facilities appointed by the participating municipalities. The intervention will consist of 2 weekly group training sessions for the participants.

The interventions group will train using interactive modular tiles. The tiles include preprogrammed games that create playful training for the participants. The tiles are described in Lund, and Lund and Jessen. The tiles are approx. 30 × 30 cm and can light up in a variety of colors and detect pressure. The rules of the games developed for the tiles vary, but in general the player should press the tiles that light up. Another tile will then light up getting the player to move from tile to tile in order to play the game. The player controls the speed and intensity of the games by their choice of movement speed, if they move quicker the game will become quicker. The games are focused on the lower body (primary legs).

The control group will receive "usual care", which here refers to normal day activities.

The intervention is done in the form of groups of 4–5 participants per set of tiles, with 2–3 sets of tiles at a time (see Fig. 1: Group training with the IMT). As more sets can be used it is possible to make groups of more people. The training will consist of 1.5–3 min of training (depending on the game) on tiles and then rest while the other 2–3 participants train (4–6 min of break). Then the participants will train for 1.5–3 min again until each participant has received a total of 13 min of training. The control group will not train.

### Image analysis reveals molecularly distinct patterns of TILs in NSCLC associated with treatment outcome [^1ffefd94]. NPJ Precision Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

A targeted tile selection was performed to reduce computational complexity by selecting tiles that preserve the most diversity in D 1, D 2, D 5, and D 6. Specifically, Principal Component Analysiswas used to reduce the size of the original feature matrix obtained from graph- and shape-based feature extraction (details below), from 240 dimensions to 2 dimensions. Subsequently, kernel density estimationwas used to identify the top 20% most representative tiles corresponding to the kernel density values for each case. Supplementary Fig. 1 shows the kernel density map and example tiles from one patient. These selected tiles were used for the downstream analysis.

19 features relating to the density of TILs (DenTIL features) were extracted. These features include descriptors such as the ratio between the number of TILs and the tissue area, the ratio between the number of TILs and the total number of nuclei, and the ratio between the total area covered by TILs to the total area of the tissue. A total of 350 features to quantify the spatial arrangement of TILs and spatial interaction between TILs and non-TILs (SpaTIL features) were also extracted. These features include area of TIL clusters and the intermixing of the TIL and non-TIL clusters, among others.

Technical details

The tumour cell detection algorithm described above only detects tumour cells at a specific stage in their cell cycle (when expressing Ki67). Assuming a typical diameter of a tumour cell to be comparable to that of a CD8 T-cell (~5 µm), we populated empty space within the tumour annotations (which were hand-drawn by a pathologist) with tumour cells up to a density of 70% of the maximum possible with tight packing of cells. The size of each grid cell in our simulations is considered to be one cell width, which we assume is on the order of magnitude of 5 µm. Although alternative grid definitions are possible (such as off-latticeor hexagonal), in order to be consistent with the original model, we opted to work with a square lattice and single occupancy of grid spaces. We did not observe any artefacts in our simulations due to the lattice choice.

We subdivide each biopsy into as many minimally overlapping square tiles (of dimension 100 × 100 cell widths) as possible. Each of these tiles is passed to the model as an input. The tiling algorithm that we developed selects tiles from the images while obeying the following rules: at least 90% overlap with tissue annotations and tile overlap of ≤ 10%.

As well as the positions of CD8 and tumour cells in the tiles, the model requires physiological properties of the cells as an input such as proliferation capacity and stem cell-ness. To this end, for each cell at each position, a number of different properties are stored and updated with each iteration of the model. Since there is no way to obtain these properties from the real biopsy images, we assigned them according to realistic estimations. The properties and our allocations at baseline are listed in Table 3.

Table 3
Assigned properties of the tumour cells and immune cells in the preprocessing script.

For each patient in the dataset, the input to the simulation model consists of a stack of tiles extracted from the full pretreatment biopsy image, each of size 100 × 100 cell widths, and a structure containing the properties of the cells in each tile. Depending on the size of the original sample, the number of tiles per patient ranged from 1–65 and the number of tiles per patient are listed in Table 1. We excluded samples from which less than four tiles were extracted to increase statistical confidence in our results.

### Mosaic: in-memory computing and routing for small-world spike-based neuromorphic systems [^b09911a4]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Calculation of memory footprint

We calculate the Mosaic architecture's Memory Footprint (MF) in comparison to a large crossbar array, in building small-world graphical models.

To evaluate the MF for one large crossbar array, the total number of devices required to implement any possible connections between neurons can be counted - allowing for any Spiking Recurrent Neural Networks (SRNN) to be mapped onto the system. Setting N to be the number of neurons in the system, the total possible number of connections in the graph is M F r e f = N 2.

For the Mosaic architecture, the number of RRAM cells (i.e. the MF) is equal to the number of devices in all the Neuron Tiles and Routing Tiles: M F m o s a i c = M F N e u r o n T i l e s + M F R o u t i n g T i l e s.

Considering each Neuron Tile with k neurons, each Neuron Tile contributes to 5 k 2 devices (where the factor of 5 accounts for the four possible directions each tile can connect to, plus the recurrent connections within the tile). Evenly dividing the N total number of neurons in each Neuron Tile gives rise to T = c e i l (N / k) required Neuron Tiles. This brings the total number of devices attributed to the Neuron Tile to T ⋅ 5 k 2.

The number of Routing Tiles that connects all the Neuron Tiles depends on the geometry of the Mosaic systolic array. Here, we assume Neuron Tiles assembled in a square, each with a Routing Tile on each side. We consider R to be the number of Routing Tiles with (4 k) 2 devices in each. This brings the total number of devices related to Routing Tiles up to M F R o u t i n g T i l e s = R ⋅ (4 k) 2.

### High-throughput whole-slide scanning to enable large-scale data repository building [^4aa48e30]. The Journal of Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

High‐throughput whole‐slide scanning

High‐throughput slide scanning can be distinguished from conventional slide scanning by the presence of all three of the following factors:
Scan speed: the scanner must be able to scan slides quickly at the target magnification. Although manufacturers often cite the 15 × 15 scan speed (the time it takes to scan a 15 × 15 mm square region in the slide), there are several factors that are often not captured by this metric. For example, the geometry of the tissue on the slide can impact the time it takes to scan a slide, particularly for line scanners (as opposed to tile scanners, Figure 2). This effectively makes the scan area larger, leading to longer scan times. Also, other factors such as the time it takes for the scanner to load the slide onto the stage can vary considerably across scanners, and in many cases pre‐scan snapshots, focal plane capture, and file post‐processing can be a significant factor in the duration of a scan, which may not necessarily be accounted for in the manufacturer's specification. There are a multitude of other factors as well that can impact speed considerably, such as tile overlap, objective magnification, focal plane range and precision, tissue detection sensitivity, geometric parameters, and others. Therefore, the 'real world' speed of a scanner on slides likely to be encountered in practice should be assessed before predicting throughput. To demonstrate how this may vary across modern scanners, we measured the scan time from nine sample slides scanned on four different scanners (Table 1). The fastest scanner that we tested usually scanned slides in under 2 min, and for some slides, under 1 min. The two slowest scanners were 7.4× slower, on average, with particularly long scan times for large tissue sections.
Capacity: the scanner capacity must be large enough to enable batch scanning without the need for frequent human interaction. Many modern whole‐slide scanners can accommodate several hundred to a thousand slides per batch. The optimal capacity for a high‐throughput operation should be built around the anticipated volume for the project. For example, if only 400 slides are loaded by staff per day, a 1,000‐slide capacity scanner will likely have a lot of unused capacity. Conversely, a single 100‐slide scanner may also not be optimal, as the staff would have to unload/reload the scanner several times per day to accommodate their volume. Depending on budget, available space, and the needs of the project, several smaller‐capacity scanners may sometimes be preferable to a single large‐capacity scanner, as they can operate in parallel, therefore scanning more quickly (all else being equal) and enabling users to mitigate downtime by scanning on the remaining scanners in case of scanner failure. It may also provide a more flexible method for prioritizing urgent scans, although many manufacturers have built such functionality into their scanners already.
Automation: a high‐throughput operation fundamentally relies on the ability to batch scan multiple slides quickly without significant user intervention or excessive setup time. This requires a degree of automation that, at minimum, relies on accurate automatic tissue detection and focusing but also benefits from other factors as described in the following section.

Interventional radiology preparatory and recovery rooms — counts and bay sizes are specified as follows: the minimum recommendation is 1.5 preparatory and 1.5 recovery bays per IR suite, and the consensus panel generally supports 2.5–3.2 prep/recovery rooms per IR suite. For patient bays and rooms, a minimum of 60 square feet of clear floor space should be provided for each patient in a lounge chair or stretcher; for individual patient cubicles, a minimum of 80 square feet should be provided; and for single-bed rooms, a minimum of 100 square feet should be provided. Per IR suite, 3–4 preparatory and recovery rooms are recommended, and if additional space is unavailable for patients needing recovery for 6–36 hours, additional preparatory and/or recovery rooms may be necessary.

### Unraveling microglial spatial organization in the developing human brain with deepCellMap, a deep learning approach coupled with spatial statistics [^b9f7161e]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Cell detection and segmentation

Given the arbitrary division of the image into tiles and the possibility that cells may be present on several tiles, the following procedure is applied to ensure that all cells are taken into account and not counted more than once. During the detection procedure on a tile, the 8 neighboring tiles are considered, and the segmentation algorithm is applied to the resulting 3 × 3 tile image. The centers of mass of detected cells with part of their body in the central tile are calculated; if this center of mass is in the central tile, then the cell belongs to this tile. The segmentation algorithm proceeds in several steps, applied to each tile whose tissue percentage exceeds 5% (Supplementary Fig. 4 A). First, Image binarization is performed with the Otsu adaptive thresholding from the eosin color-deconvolution of the RGB image. The algorithm evaluates the histogram of the eosin image and finds two critical thresholds, allowing it to separate three regions. Pixels belonging to the third region are assigned a value of 1, while the others are set to 0 (Supplementary Fig. 4 B1). Small isolated fragments of the binary mask are removed by using a disk of radius r = 1. (Supplementary Fig. 4 B2). Then, a morphological dilation with a disk of radius r = 3 is applied to the binary mask to connect the different binary masks belonging to the same cells (Supplementary Fig. 4 B3). Holes in the cell mask are filled by a background reconstruction (Supplementary Fig. 4 B4), and finally, a size filter is applied to cell masks, and cells with a size smaller than a threshold T = 700pixels) are filtered out (Supplementary Fig. 4 B5).

During this segmentation procedure, two parameters can be adjusted by the user: the radius r of the dilation disk (between 2 and 4), and the maximum size of the cells, which depends mainly on the resolution of the image.

The output is a binary mask of segmented cells over the background. Five parameters are associated with each segmented cell: row and column of the corresponding tile, coordinates (x, y) of the cell center of mass, and cell size (sum of mask pixels equal to 1). For brightfield images, the result of the DL classification into the different types of microglial cells is also listed.

### Uncomputability of phase diagrams [^9c1212a3]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

A set of Wang tiles — square, 2D tiles with coloured sides, with the rule that adjacent sides of neighbouring tiles in a tiling of the plane must have matching colours — can be mapped to a classical Hamiltonian: if tiles t i, t j cannot be placed next to each other, then we introduce a terminto the Hamiltonian. The overall Hamiltonian is the sum over all such local terms, such that its ground state represents a tiling satisfying the tiling rules (if such a tiling exists). If no such tiling exists, the ground state energy is ≥ 1.

Similarly, it is well known that there exist tile sets that encode the evolution of a classical TM, within a square grid: TM tape configurations are represented by rows, such that adjacent rows represent successive time steps of the TM (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2
The evolution of a classical TM can be represented by Wang tiles, where colours of adjacent tiles have to match, and arrowheads have to meet arrow tails of the appropriate kind.

Here, the evolution runs from the bottom of the square to the top, where it places a marker
- on the boundary as explained in section 'Classical tiling with quantum overlay'. In this image, the TM's evolution is contained in an individual square in the checkerboard grid shown in the figure below.

We combine both Wang tiles and the TM tiling ideas by constructing a tile set whose valid tilings have the following properties:
A tiling pattern that creates a square grid across the lattice Λ (much like a checkerboard). The side length of the grid squares can be varied (provided all grid squares are the same size) and still correspond to a valid tiling (depicted in Fig. 3).
Within each square of the grid, we use the tiles to encode a TM that first counts the size of the square it is contained in, and then outputs a marker
- on the top border of the square, where the placement of this marker is a function of the size of the square (depicted in Fig. 2).

### MOCHA's advanced statistical modeling of scATAC-seq data enables functional genomic inference in large human cohorts [^807d9cba]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Step 2: Simulating the number of fragments in individual cells. Each simulated cell was randomly allocated a mean of 4k fragments, following a Poisson distribution (= 4000). To simulate our quality control (QC) thresholds for sequencing depth, we excluded cells with fewer than 1000 fragments. The process was repeated until a target number of simulated cells was reached.

Step 3: Assigning fragments to open and closed tiles within each cell. Simulating a FRIP (fraction of reads in peaks) score of 95%, a random number of fragments were assigned to the open tiles using a Poisson distribution (= 0.95*fragment number) while the rest fragments were randomly assigned to the closed tiles with equal weight. For the open tiles, we first simulated their relative weight using a Beta distribution (1,3) and then allocated the corresponding fragments to individual open tiles according to their relative weights. These weights were set to simulate real data of many low accessible tiles and few highly accessible ones.

Step 4: Positioning fragments in individual tiles. To determine the precise location of fragments assigned to open tiles, we first assigned the midpoint of each fragment to the center of the corresponding tile and then used a Poisson distribution (= 5) to add a random offset from the center. The direction of the offset (left or right) was randomly generated with a Bernoulli distribution (p = 0.5). For fragments assigned to closed tiles, their position was randomly distributed across 'closed' tiles.

Step 5: Determining the length of individual fragments. We simulated the length of individual fragments following a Poisson mixture distribution so that approximately 90% of fragments have a mean length of 75 bp, and 10% with a mean length of 200 bp.

Step 6: Assembling simulated scATAC-seq data. All simulated fragments from all simulated cells were treated as a scATAC-seq sample, saved in a single fragment file, and converted into a normalized bedgraph file for peak calling.

### Drosophila activins adapt gut size to food intake and promote regenerative growth [^b4a7d622]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Image analysis and quantifications

Image analysis and quantifications were performed using the open-source FIJI software. For quantitative measurements of specific cell types per area, a z-stacks were acquired with a 20x objective in the R4bc region for each mounted gut. Acquired z-stacks were converted to maximum-intensity projections and cell numbers was manually counted using the CellCounter Fiji plugin and normalized to the total epithelial area counted in. Cells per area is defined as cells per 10000 μm 2 in all cases. For quantitative measurements of total number of specific cell types in posterior midguts, tiles of z-stacks were acquired covering the entire posterior midgut from top to halfway through the organ. Acquired z-stacks were converted to maximum-intensity projections and cell numbers was manually counted using the CellCounter Fiji plugin and multiplied by two. For quantifications of gut dimensions, tiled images of entire fixed midguts mounted with 0,12 mm spacers were acquired with fluorescence imaging with a 5x objective and stitched together in Zen Blue imaging software (Zeizz). Length was then measured in Fiji by drawing a segmented line using spline along the center of each midgut while R4 width was measured by drawing a straight line perpendicular to the midgut at the widest point in the R4 region. TUNEL + cells were determined in FIJI by applying the following steps to each maximum-intensity projection: (1) kuwahara filter = 5, (2) smooth, (3) auto threshold = max entropy, (4) convert to mask, (5) watershed, and (6) analyze particles.

### Acute canopy deficits in global cities exposed by the 3-30-300 benchmark for urban nature [^3e862080]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Testing whether three trees are in view of each building used only building footprints and tree inventory data. The workflow used in FME Workbench (originally named Feature Manipulation Engine) is shown in Supplementary 6, and Fig. 7 shows an example of the analysis, with lines of sight between trees and buildings demonstrated.

Fig. 7
Example of sightline analysis, showing views from buildings (magenta lines) to trees (blue dots).

Counts of visible trees are posted as labels on each building.

To determine whether each building was likely to have a view of three or more trees, each building footprint polygon was converted into a set of vertices (or points) at five-metre intervals. This served to represent potential window locations on each building façade, assuming that most unobstructed facades on buildings will have one or more windows at reasonable intervals and that obstructed facades could be identified in subsequent analytical steps. Second, a 'nearest neighbour' test was used to draw lines between each window vertex and each tree location. The closest three trees within 30 m of each vertex were identified by this mechanism. The resulting lines represent sightlines from a notional window location at every 5 m along the building façade. Data quality and processing limitations meant that building height was not factored into the analysis; this is a limitation of our study. Property-by-property viewshed analysis would require a 3D model of each city, including tree and building heights, as well the floorplates of every apartment and townhouse to ensure viewsheds calculated based on window locations were correctly assigned to properties. We anticipate that three-dimensional city-scale analyses of this precision would require very powerful computing resources, well beyond the reach of the national council arborist/planner that we role-played in this study. This analysis could potentially add slightly more nuance to this study both by assigning positive scores to windows that have views over other buildings (and therefore are unobstructed) and by identifying windows that are so high up that the view to trees is too distant to be counted. This (modest) limitation is discussed further in Supplementary 7.

Airway comparative analysis — matching strategies and considerations: Table 5 outlines selection criteria including anatomical property via designation of "Terminal bronchiole," branching hierarchy by "Designating a generation number for each airway," distance from a landmark using "Path distance (e.g., 5 cm from carina or pleura)," airway dimension via "Lumen size (e.g., 2-mm-diameter airways)," and airways of a stipulated inner perimeter using "Wall thickness of airways with inner perimeter of 10 mm (Pi10)." Considerations note that "Pathology may alter airway status," "There are anatomical variations in branching pattern; certain nomenclature systems do not cover the entire airway tree," and there is "Risk of bias when pathology alters airway dimension (e.g. COPD may narrow airway lumens; therefore, 2-mm airways may occur at a different generation compared with subjects without COPD)," and "Regression assumptions should be confirmed in the condition(s) under study; potential effects of outliers on regression equation should be assessed"; definitions specify "PiX = predicted wall thickness of airways with inner perimeter of X" and "Pi10 = predicted wall thickness of airways with inner perimeter of 10 mm."

### Healthy housing reference manual [^02ccabf5]. CDC (2006). Medium credibility.

Healthy Housing Reference Manual — 19th-century tenement housing conditions are outlined, noting that children had a one in six chance of dying before the age of 1 year. In the report, 50 recommendations were made, including recommendations for protecting school children by ventilation and sanitation of school buildings, emphasizing town planning and controlling overcrowded tenements and cellar dwellings. The term "tenement house" was first used in America and dates from the mid-nineteenth century; the author noted that in the larger cities of the United States, the apartment house emerged in the 1830s as a housing unit of two to five stories, with each story containing apartments of two to four rooms, and the tenement house emerged in the 1830s when landlords converted warehouses into inexpensive housing. These rear houses, although new, were no healthier than the front house, often housing up to 10 families. By 1850 in New York and Boston, each tenement housed an average of 65 people. During the 1850s, the railroad house or railroad tenement was introduced; the structure was typically 90 feet long and had 12 to 16 rooms, each about 6 feet by 6 feet and holding around four people, and the facility allowed no direct light or air into rooms except those facing the street or alley.

Substantive provisions of a housing code — egress, lighting/ventilation, thermal standards, and occupancy/structural conditions include that within each dwelling unit two or more means of egress should be provided to safe and open space at ground level. The housing code should spell out minimum standards for lighting and ventilation within each room in the structure, and in addition, minimum thermal standards should be provided; although most codes merely provide the requirement of a given temperature at a given height above floor level, the community should give consideration to the use of effective temperatures. The effective temperature is a means of incorporating not only absolute temperature in degrees, but also humidity and air movement, giving a better indication of the comfort index of a room. The code should provide that no person shall occupy or let for occupancy any dwelling or dwelling units that do not comply with stated requirements, which generally specify that the foundations, floors, exterior walls, doors, window space and windows be sound and in good repair; that it be moisture-free, watertight and reasonably weather tight and that all structural surfaces be sound and in good repair.

Keyword spotting task description

For keyword spotting task, we used SHD dataset (20 classes, 8156 training, 2264 test samples). Each input example drawn from the dataset is sampled three times along the channel dimension without overlap to obtain three augmentations of the same data with 256 channels each. The advantage of this method is that it allows feeding the input stream to fewer Neuron Tiles by reducing the input dimension and also triples the sizes of both training and testing datasets.

We set the simulation time step to 1 ms in our simulations. The recurrent neural network architecture consists of 2048 LIF neurons with 45 ms membrane time constant. The neurons are distributed into 8 × 8 Neuron Tiles with 32 neurons each. The input spikes are fed only into the neurons of the Mosaic layout's first row (8 tiles). The network prediction is determined after presenting each speech data for 100 ms by counting the total number of spikes from 20 neurons (total number of classes) in 2 output Neuron Tiles located in the bottom-right of the Mosaic layout. The neurons inside input and output Neuron Tiles are not recurrently connected. The network is trained using BPTT on the loss L = L C E + λ L M, where L C E is the cross-entropy loss between input logits and target and L M is the Mosaic-layout aware regularization term. We use batch size of 512 and suitably tuned hyperparameters.

### Spatial patterns of hepatocyte glucose flux revealed by stable isotope tracing and multi-scale microscopy [^eee0773b]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Here, the distance d between points p and q in n -dimensional Euclidean space can be defined in terms of q i and p i, or the cartesian coordinate component in the i th dimension of the n-dimensional space. To identify "contact sites" between neighboring organelles, we first defined a range of distances as our search radius. In our case, we considered pixels to be "in contact" with one another between different organelle objects if the distance between two pixels was within 1–2-pixel lengths, or 5–10 nm. Next, we centered on the pixels lying along the perimeter of each organelle object and calculated relative distances between neighboring organelles. To reduce the time needed for computations, distance calculations were only performed on a "region of interest" (in 2D, a [m + 1] x [m + 1] matrix where "m" is the maximum of our "search threshold" in pixels) centered on said perimeter pixel. If a neighboring organelle image object contained pixels within the search distance radius, then these pixels were annotated as contacting pixels (see attached code for more details). To quantify the total area occupied by organelle contacts in each organelle, features such as the number of "contacting" pixels and the perimeter of an object in contact, for example, are recorded. To denote separate contact sites from one another, MATLAB's connected component labeling algorithm, ' bwconncomp " is used in a similar fashion to how organelle objects are labeled previously. To reduce the false positive rate, contact sites of a single contacting pixel were removed. Organelle perimeters were obtained using 2D image convolution with MATLAB's " conv2" function and a kernel to detect 8-connected image edges. Perimeter length is reported as the number of pixels that lay along the perimeter, rather than the pixel length distance, thus, quantification of the percentage of an organelle objects perimeter in contact with another is reported as the ratio of the number of contacting pixels to the number of pixels along object's perimeter. To quantify the composition of each cell by organelle area, following the processing of the 8-bit organelle masks, the remaining area covered by each organelle type is compared to the area covered by the manually segmented cell mask. To obtain the average 13 C/ 12 C value for organelle image objects and per organelle type across an image, we used the arithmetic mean of the 13 C/ 12 C image pixel values in the corresponding spatial regions of interest between the different images. When calculating the distances between image objects, the centroids of the image objects are used. Circularity scores were calculated according to the formula:

### Mapping the landscape of histomorphological cancer phenotypes using self-supervised learning on unannotated pathology slides [^c036871b]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Cancer diagnosis and management depend upon the extraction of complex information from microscopy images by pathologists, which requires time-consuming expert interpretation prone to human bias. Supervised deep learning approaches have proven powerful, but are inherently limited by the cost and quality of annotations used for training. Therefore, we present Histomorphological Phenotype Learning, a self-supervised methodology requiring no labels and operating via the automatic discovery of discriminatory features in image tiles. Tiles are grouped into morphologically similar clusters which constitute an atlas of histomorphological phenotypes (HP-Atlas), revealing trajectories from benign to malignant tissue via inflammatory and reactive phenotypes. These clusters have distinct features which can be identified using orthogonal methods, linking histologic, molecular and clinical phenotypes. Applied to lung cancer, we show that they align closely with patient survival, with histopathologically recognised tumor types and growth patterns, and with transcriptomic measures of immunophenotype. These properties are maintained in a multi-cancer study.

Initial registration

The initial registration step finds offsets between all image tiles using the anchor images taken on round 8 (which we refer to as 'reference images'). We use this to define a global coordinate system for the entire tissue sample.

Because we use a square tiling strategy, each tile may have up to four 'neighbours': other tiles with which it has a region of substantial overlap. We denote the set of neighbouring tile pairs as 𝔑.

Spots first are detected in each tile's reference images, as local maxima of the filtered image exceeding a fixed detection threshold. To align the reference images, we loop over all pairs of neighbouring tiles, and compute an offset to register the overlapping regions of the filtered reference images of these two tiles. The offset between two tiles T 1 and T 2 is found by exhaustive search over all 2D shifts in a range around to the shift expected from the microscope's position sensor. For each shift, we find for each spot s on T 1 the pixel distance D s to the nearest spot on T 2 after the shift has been applied. A score is computed as, and the final shift vectoris taken as the one that maximizes this score; that is, the one with the most near neighbours.

We define a single global coordinate system by finding the coordinate origin X T for each tile T. Note that this problem is overdetermined as there are more neighbour pairs than there are tiles. We therefore compute the offsets by minimizing the loss function

Differentiating this loss function with respect to X T yields a set of simultaneous linear equations, the solution of which yields the origins of each tile on the reference round. The results of this step suffice to define a global coordinate system, but do not provide pixel-level alignment of images from multiple colour channels on multiple rounds, owing to the occurrence of chromatic aberration and small rotational or non-rigid shifts. The latter will be dealt with in the next step, through point cloud registration.

### Toroidal topology of population activity in grid cells [^7f4ab5aa]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

Toroidal rate map visualization

For visualization, toroidal firing rate maps were calculated in the same way as the physical space covariate (see 'Spatial position and direction tuning'), first binning the toroidal surface into a square grid of 7.2° × 7.2° bins and computing the average spike rate in each position bin. However, for toroidal maps, it was necessary to address the 60° angle between the toroidal axes before smoothing. After binning the toroidal coordinates, the rate map was 'straightened' by shifting the bins along the x axis ('horizontally') the length of (y mod 2)/2 bins, where y is the vertical enumeration of the given bin. Copies of the rate map were then tiled in a three-by-three square (similar to Extended Data Fig. 5d), before applying the closing and smoothing operations as for the spatial firing rate map. The single toroidal rate map was finally recovered by cutting out the centre tile, rotating it 90° and defining 15° shear angles along both the x and the y axis to correct for the 60° offset between them.

Comparison of spatial periodicity

Differences in grid periodicity between OF and WW environments were quantified for a given cell by comparing the grid scores in the two behavioural conditions. Two alternative methods were used to generate the spatial autocorrelograms for this comparison: (1) comparing the autocorrelograms for OF and WW directly; and (2) comparing autocorrelograms for OF and WW after first equalizing the spatial coverage between the two conditions.

For method (1), rate maps were calculated as specified in the above section 'Spatial position and direction tuning', using the same grid of 3 × 3-cm bins for both environments. This set of bins spanned the entirety of the OF arena and covered most of the WW track apart from some small regions at the outer extrema, which were discarded for the purpose of this analysis. For each of the two rate maps, the autocorrelogram was computed and the grid score was calculated.

Method (2) was similar to method (1), except that the cell's OF rate map was converted into a 'masked OF' rate map, by removing all bins that were unvisited by the rat in the WW session. This effectively equalized the position coverage between the two conditions, and thus allowed for a more valid comparison.

GAN training

We used the Adam optimiser for all GAN models and the hyper-parameters as proposed in, except for the learning rates that we specifically fine-tuned. We stopped training in all settings when the FID between 10,000 real and synthetic images converged. The FID score is a commonly used metric to compare the visual quality between images synthesised by generative models and the real training data and tracking it allows for an unbiased GAN training evaluation. A low FID score means that the visual quality of the synthetic images is close, compared to the set of real images. More precisely, for both sets of images the coding layer representations of a pre-trained Inception model (v3) are extracted to obtain vision-relevant features. The sets of features are summarised as a multivariate Gaussian by calculating the mean (m) and covariance (C), and the FID score is computed aswhere (m w, C w) are the mean and covariance of real image feature representations, while (m, C) refers to the statistics for synthetic images and Tr refers to the trace, the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix. We ran all models for a minimum number of steps, until the discriminator had seen as many real images as the prog-GAN discriminator after the final stabilisation phase. At a resolution of 32 × 32 pixels, each progressive phase lasted until the discriminator had seen 1.4M real images, resulting in a minimum number of 7M real images for the other models. For 64 × 64 and 128 × 128 pixels, we lowered the number of images per phase to 1M, resulting in a minimum number of images of 7M and 9M, respectively. At this point, we computed the FID score after every 400T real images, and if there was no improvement for two consecutive evaluations, we stopped training. We stopped all repetitions for each experiment at the same step as the first model to get comparable results. For the number of classes' benchmark, the convergence point for all experiments on both datasets was between 7.0M and 9.6M real images. For the number of samples per class benchmark, the FID convergence occurred between 7.2M and 10.8M real images for sample numbers above 1500. Below that it took between 14M and 16M real images, likely due to the small amount of training data and label overfitting effects. At a resolution of 64 × 64 and 128 × 128 pixels, the GAN models converged between 9M and 11M, and between 12M and 14M, respectively. At a resolution of 256 × 256 pixels for brain scans and X-rays and at 512 × 512 pixels for X-rays, the GAN models converged at around 7.5M and 8.6M, respectively.

Downsampling comparison on open chromatin

Since pooling cells across samples before calling open tiles is a common approach, we benchmarked all three methods on the same randomly selected cell subsets ranging from 5 cells to the full set in the COVID19 dataset (n = 91). For this comparison, we utilized the same three cell types across the same three datasets. For each cell type and dataset, we used the following procedures. For MOCHA:
Generate a coverage object using predefined 500 base-pair tiles on all pooled cells (e.g. CD16 monocytes).
Predict open tiles on the pooled cells.
Count the total number of open tiles, the number of open tiles overlapping with CTCF sites, and the number of open tiles overlapping with TSSs.
Repeat (1–3) for all pre-specified downsampled cell counts.

For MACS2 and HOMER:

1. Generate a coverage file on all pooled cells (e.g. CD16 monocytes),

2. Call peaks on the pooled cells.

3. Convert the peak regions onto the pre-defined MOCHA tiles.

4. Remove tiles that extend onto empty regions.

5. Count the total number of open tiles, the number of open tiles overlapping with CTCF sites, and the number of open tiles overlapping with TSSs.

6. Repeated (1–5) for the pre-specified downsampled cell counts.

Simulating fragments and open chromatin from scATAC-seq

To benchmark HOMER, MACS2, and MOCHA, we designed a simulation study to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of each method. The simulated scATAC-seq data is constructed in 6 steps as follows:

Step 1: Defining open and closed tiles as the ground truth. We first splitted each chromosome into 500 bp tiles. We then assigned roughly 200,000 open tiles across the genome, with the number of open tiles per chromosome being proportional to the chromosome's length. Afterwards, we distributed the open tiles along each chromosome with a sinusoidal probability (negative values set to 0) with a periodicity of 10 tiles, to mimic periodic appearances of open regions followed by large closed regions. All other tiles were defined to be closed. We treated these open and closed tiles as the ground truth in this simulation analysis. In this step, each sampling draws a different peakset and thus mimics a cell type with its own peakset.

### Satellite mapping reveals extensive industrial activity at sea [^8c3e2c81]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

First, we are classifying the environmental context in which the vessel in question operates. To do so, we constructed 11 gridded fields (rasters) with a resolution of 0.01° (approximately 1 km per pixel at the equator) and with global coverage. At every pixel, each raster contains contextual information on the following variables: (1) vessel density (based on SAR); (2) average vessel length (based on SAR); (3) bathymetry; (4) distance from port, (5) and (6) hours of non-fishing-vessel presence (from the AIS) for vessels less than 50 m and more than 50 m, respectively; (7) average surface temperature; (8) average current speed; (9) standard deviation of daily temperature; (10) standard deviation of daily current speed; and (11) average chlorophyll. For every detected vessel, we sampled 100 × 100-pixel tiles from these rasters, producing an 11-band image that we then classified with the ConvNet. Each detection is thus provided with context in an area just over 100 × 100 km. We obtained the fishing and non-fishing labels from AIS vessel identities.

Second, our predictions are produced with an ensemble of two models with no overlap in spatial coverage. To avoid leakage of spatial information between the training sets of the two models, and also to maximize spatial coverage, we divided the centre of the tiles into a 1° longitude and latitude grid. We then generated two independent labelled datasets, one containing the tiles from the 'even' and the other from the 'odd' latitude and longitude grid cells. This alternating 1° (the size of the tile) strategy ensures no spatial overlap between tiles across the two sets. We trained two independent models, one for 'even' tiles and another for 'odd' tiles, with each model 'seeing' a fraction of the ocean that the other model does not 'see'. The test set that we used to evaluate both models contains tiles from both 'even' and 'odd' grid cells, with a 0.5° buffer around all the test grid cells removed from all the neighbouring cells (used for training) to ensure spatial independence across all data partitions (no leakage). By averaging the predictions from these two models, we covered the full spatial extent of our detections with independent and complementary spatial information.

### A transcriptomic axis predicts state modulation of cortical interneurons [^8863c988]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

Spot detection and fine registration

The second processing step detects spots in all images of the seven sequencing rounds, performs fine alignment of colour channels and sequencing rounds, and computes for each spot a position in global coordinates and an intensity vector summarizing that spot's detected fluorescence in each round and channel.

The most intricate part of this step is fine image registration. Even though the same tile layout is used for all sequencing rounds, the precise positions of the tiles may differ owing to slight shifts in the placement and rotation of the sample. Thus, a single spot might be found on different tiles in different sequencing rounds. Furthermore, owing to chromatic aberration, a spot may be in slightly different positions (although not different tiles) in different colour channels. Because most spots are only a few pixels in size, even a one-pixel registration error can compromise accurate RNA reads.

A global coordinate is defined for each of the spots detected in the reference images using the initial registration described above. In regions where tiles overlap, duplicate spots are rejected by keeping only spots which are closer in global coordinates to the centre of their original tile than to any other.

Next, spot positions are detected in images from all sequencing rounds and colour channels. These are used to align each round and colour channel to the corresponding tile's reference image, using point cloud registration. Specifically, we fit an affine transformation from each reference image to the images of the corresponding tile for all rounds and colour channels, using the iterative-closest point (ICP) algorithm with matches further than 3 pixels away excluded. These affine transformations can include shifts, scalings, rotations and shears, but we did not find it necessary to introduce nonlinear warping transformations within tiles (nonlinear transformations can still occur globally by variation of the affine transformation across tiles). As the ICP algorithm is highly sensitive to local maxima, it is initialized from a shift transformation computed by the same method used to find the overlap between reference images; that is, the shift that maximizes the number of near neighbours as measured by. When spots are located on neighbouring tiles on different rounds, the corresponding images are again registered with ICP.

Finally, a seven-dimensional intensity vector V s, r is computed for each spot s in each round r, by reading the intensity from the aligned coordinate of each filtered image.

Action levels for lead — current action levels identified by HUD and EPA define thresholds for lead in paint, dust, and soil. For paint, lab analysis thresholds are 5,000 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) or 5,000 parts per million (ppm) 0.5% lead by weight, and x-ray fluorescence is 1 milligram per square centimeter (mg/cm^2). For dust, floors are 40 micrograms per square foot (μg/ft^2); window sills are 250 μg/ft^2 and window troughs are 400 μg/ft^2 (clearance only). For soil, high-contact bare play areas are 400 ppm and other yard areas are 1,200 ppm. Lead is considered a potential hazard if above the following levels, but can be a hazard at lower levels if improperly handled.

a Iso-contours of the probability density function (pdf) of a Gaussian mixture model in two dimensions. b Iso-contours of the magnitude of the score function for the same pdf. Note that the score function is large in regions where the density is small.

Our approach begins by dividing a single four-channel immunofluorescence (IF) image of a slide into approximately N ≈ 2.5 million tiles (see Fig. 2). The size of the tile is selected so that each tile contains, on average, up to 4 events, where an event may be a cell, a vesicle or some other blood-based analyte. For applications considered in this study, this yields tiles with 32 × 32 pixels. Thereafter, uncorrelated Gaussian noise is added to each tile and pairs of clean and noisy tiles are used to train a DAE. When the training is complete, each tile is used as input to the DAE and the magnitude of the difference between the output of the DAE and the tile itself is evaluated for each IF channel. This scalar is multiplied with user-supplied channel weights, such that markers with important variance in the assay are emphasized, and the resulting products are summed to yield a single reconstruction error value for each tile. This error is used as a rarity metric to rank the tiles from most rare (largest reconstruction error) to least rare and a cohortrare tiles is identified. In the final step, an algorithm to remove imaging artifacts from the rare tile cohort is applied and tiles with artifacts are replaced with tiles with slightly lower rarity metric. The approach is described in detail in the Methods section. We refer to this algorithm as the Rare Event Detection algorithm, or the RED algorithm in short.

A pair of rays propagating from different points of a finite electron source are formed into a parallel beam on the sample, and are forward propagated from the sample and formed into a projected and magnified image on the detector (camera) plane. The beam is deflected above the sample to illuminate an adjacent location on the sample, and the subsequent image is returned to the optic axis to be acquired by the camera. b – d Cricket sequentially scans each tile of a 3 × 3 matrix pattern on the sample, producing a "supertile" at a stage position with overlap between tiles.

Protection against injury — building codes and home injury epidemiology (Home Safety Council) are summarized: The International Code Council one- and two-family dwelling code states the "purpose of building codes is to provide minimum standards for the protection of life, limb, property, environment, and for the safety and welfare of the consumer, general public, and the owners and occupants of residential buildings regulated by this code." HSC reports that in 1998 "the leading causes of home injury deaths… were falls and poisonings, which accounted for 6,756 and 5,758 deaths, respectively," with higher fall death rates "among those older than 64 years," and that "stairs or steps were associated with 17% of fall deaths." Nonfatal burden is substantial as "falls were the leading cause of nonfatal, unintentional injuries occurring at home and accounted for 5.6 million injuries." Emergency visits were often linked to "stairs and steps, accounting for 854,631 visits, and floors, accounting for 556,800 visits." Safety features were frequently lacking: "one-third of all households with stairs did not have banisters or handrails," and "homes with older persons were more likely to have banisters or handrails than were those where young children live or visit." Additional findings include that "48% of households have windows on the second floor or above, but only 25% have window locks or bars," "Bathtub mats or nonskid strips… were used in 63% of American households," while "in senior households (age 70 years and older), 79% used mats or nonskid strips," yet "Nineteen percent of the total number of homes surveyed had grab bars" and "only 39% of the group most susceptible to falls (people aged 70 years and older) used both nonskid surfaces and grab bars."

Methods

Geometrical definitions

The islands are distributed on the geometrical active surface of each electrode (A total = 2.25 cm 2) in a periodic hexagonal array. This arrangement is defined by a two-dimensional unit cell in which islands of diameter d are separated by a pitch c (i.e. the centre-to-centre separation), as shown in Fig. 1b. Consequently, the area of this unit cell A uc is given by Eq. (1). The total perimeter of the islands within the unit cell is three times their circumference:The interfacial density ρ int is defined as the total length of the perimeter of the islands per unit area of the electrode. Therefore, ρ int can be calculated as the ratio of L uc to A uc, as shown in Eq. (3). It follows that this value can also be obtained by multiplying the total number of islands on the electrode n by their circumference, and then dividing by the electrode area. Analogously, the fraction of the electrode surface covered by the In 2 O 3 or In islands (S C) can be calculated either from the unit cell or from the total surface of the electrode, as shown in Eq. (4). The fraction of the electrode surface modified by the diffusion of indium from the islands (S M) depends on the diameter of the islands and on the width of the concentric rings (x), but more crucially, on the total number of islands on each electrode, which varies in the same way across different samples as the interfacial density, as shown in Eq. (2). In geometric terms, the relationship between these variables is shown by Eq. (5).

Quantifying infected myc Prnp cells

To determine the proportion of infected G70 PrP-expressing cells at early time points after prion infection, three separate automated scans of 9 × 9 tiles with approximately 40 cells per tile were set up for every condition with a 5% overlap among tiles. Background levels were adjusted as specified above. For cell phenotypic analysis, cells double-positive for anti-myc and 6D11 were manually scored based on fluorescence intensity using Zen black 2.3SP1. The total number of cells was determined by scoring DAPI-positive nuclei using Volocity software. To determine the percentage of 5B2-positive cells (Fig. 7B), tile scans of 9 × 9 tiles were acquired and cells were scored based on the detection of anti-5B2-positive PrP d at the plasma membrane.

Transcriptional gene silencing

Transient knockdown of gene expression was conducted by reverse transfection of cells using siRNA pools (siTOOLs Biotech GmbH, Martinsried, Germany) which contain up to 30 siRNAs to achieve maximal transcript coverage and highly efficient gene knockdown. Briefly, siRNA pools were reconstituted with nuclease-free water to a stock concentration of 10 µM. Two µl siPool and 6 µl RNAimax transfection reagent were added to 42 µl FBS-free OPTIMEM and incubated to form a complex. After 5 min, 950 µl OFCS were added to the RNA complex and 1 mL of 1.33 × 10 5 cells (reverse transfection) was added for a final concentration of 6.7 × 10 5 cells/ml.

Literature Review

Nursing home architecture has been evolving in some notable ways over the past 20 years as new approaches to long-term care services for older adults have been implemented (e.g. Eden Alternative, Planetree Model, Pioneer Network Culture Change;). There are now two clear ends of the spectrum for nursing home settings. At one end are nursing home environments that continue to reflect the institutional architecture of hospital layouts promoted and constructed between 1960 and 1990 (see Figure 1). The environmental characteristics of these buildings focus primarily on the staff role in the delivery of a "traditional" medical model of care. One of the most defining features of this institutional design is long, double-loaded corridors that lead to a nurse station where procedures such as charting and medication distribution happen in a public setting. Social spaces such as dining rooms and lounges are large and sized to be used and shared by all residents in the nursing home.

Figure 1.
Traditional medical model architectural layout for skilled nursing care.

At the other end of the spectrum are small household designs that support "person-centered" models of care. The architecture and interior features are scaled down and designed to focus primarily on replicating a residential environment with the goal of resident autonomy and quality of life (see Figure 2). Households (HHs) are defined as a small group of residents who live together in a clearly defined setting that has a front door and contains a functional kitchen, a dining room, and a living room. The composition of these living areas (LAs) can vary but one of the first distinctions as a HH (beyond the small size of 10–12) is the proximity of resident bedrooms to the social spaces. Another defining feature of the HH model is the departure from the double-loaded corridors that dominate the traditional nursing home environment.

### Cutting edge or blunt instrument: how to decide if a stepped wedge design is right for you [^471f52f2]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2021). High credibility.

When might I consider doing a stepped wedge trial?

Research designs are shaped as much by practical constraints as by abstract schemes, and it is always a good idea to start with the constraints and work towards a design, rather than start with a design and try to fit it to constraints. These constraints will be unique to each research context, and box 1 lists some areas to think about. Still, there are some common features of settings where a stepped wedge trial might be considered as a possible design, and we now review these.

Box 1
Practical constraints on the design of a longitudinal cluster randomised trial

Are there limits on the time available to complete the evaluation, on the number of clusters, or on the number of participants (or the rate at which you can recruit participants) at each cluster? These constraints put limits on the overall scale of the evaluation, or force trade-offs between different design characteristics.
How will participants and their data be sampled in your study: as a series of cross-sectional surveys, as a continuous stream of incident cases, as a cohort followed over time, or some other way? Does the timescale divide into cycles, seasons or milestones that influence how you will sample participants and data?
Is there a limit on how many clusters can implement the intervention at the same time in the evaluation? If this is constrained by research resources (eg, if there are only enough trained research staff to implement the intervention one cluster at a time) then implementation must be staggered in some way.
If implementation is to be staggered, is there a minimum 'step length'? If the same team delivers the intervention in different clusters at different steps, then bear in mind it may take some time to get the intervention fully operational at a site, and the team will also need time to relocate from one cluster to the next.

Data acquisition

For our demonstrations, we set up a hidden room 2.2 m wide, 2.2 m deep and 3 m high, as shown in Fig. 4 A. Assuming the coordinate system origin is at the bottom of the occluding edge, the left wall is at x = − 1.20 m, the right wall is at x = 1 m, the back wall is at y = 2.2 m, and the ceiling is at z = 3 m. The walls are made of white foam board and the ceiling is black cloth. The SPAD array is positioned on the side of the wall, looking down at the occluding edge origin, allowing half of the array to be occluded. The laser is positioned so that it shines close to the origin. To reject the strong ballistic contribution (first bounce) of light reflected from the origin, we punched a hole in the occluding wall and shined the laser through the hole. The true location of the laser spot on the floor is slightly off the origin, by 6 cm to the right side. The latter was found by cross-checking and minimizing the number of ballistic photons measured by the SPAD array. More recent SPAD arrays incorporate a fast hard gate to rapidly enable and disable the detector with few hundreds picoseconds width, which can be tuned to censor the ballistic photons.

Two test scenarios were analyzed. For the first, we used two rectangular white foam board facets of size 20 × 110 cm as our moving objects. For the second, we used four different targets: a white foam board facet (of size 20 × 110 cm), a gray foam board facet (white foam board painted with a gray diffuse spray paint), a fabric mannequin of size 30 × 80 cm, and a stair-like facet of size 75 × 75 cm. These objects were used to test our method on targets of different shape, height and albedo. All tests were conducted with the objects facing the occluding edge. Before moving objects enter the hidden room, a 30 s acquisition was collected to form an estimate of b, the response of the stationary scene. Then, new measurement frames were collected with moving objects fixed at discrete points along their trajectories during 0.4 s. In Supplementary Note 4, we demonstrate that these measurements can be acquired over a much shorter period of time with little effect on the reconstruction quality.

Morris water maze

To assess spatial learning and memory, we trained and tested mice in a large circular pool (1.1 meters in diameter) filled with 21 °C water, which was rendered opaque by the addition of non-toxic white paint. We placed four distinct visual cues (representing different geometric shapes, patterns, and colors) on each wall, to facilitate spatial orientation and the acquisition of spatial memory. Mice were given 4 training trials/day for 5–7 consecutive days. Each training trail lasted for 1 min. Mice were trained to remember the location of a hidden platform, which was submerged 1 inch below the water surface. The location of the hidden platform (SE) remained the same during the 5–7-day training period. If after a 60 s trial, the animal failed to locate the platform, the animal was placed on the platform and allowed to remain on the platform for 15 s. Mice were trained 4 times a day and entered the pool in a randomized order of rotating entrance points (N, S, E, W, NE, and SW). During each training trial, the latency to find the hidden platform was recorded. 24 h after the last training trial, a probe trial was conducted. The platform was removed, and mice entered the arena from the NW location (opposite from the platform). The number of entries in the target area (representing the area where the platform had been located during the training trials); the total time spent in the target area; as well as the time spent in all quadrants, and the swim speed, were recorded during the 60-s probe trial. We also conducted separate trials in which a visible platform (platform elevated above the water level, on which a small red flag had been placed) was presented. Mice were given several training sessions and the time (latency) to reach the visible platform was recorded. Mouse movements, as well as average speed, distance traveled, latency to reach a quadrant or target area, or number of entries in the target area, were tracked in real-time using the TopScan Lite® software (Clever Sys Inc.) and the different measures were automatically recorded.

Assessments

Assessments took place in three environments: 1) 'home', which took place in their residential environment (e.g. home, care home or sheltered housing), 2) 'ADL flat' (Fig. 1 a), which took place in the university's Activities of Daily Living flat, which comprises a kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, and living room, and 3) 'lab', i.e. the university's gait laboratory (Fig. 1 b), where the walking pathways replicated from the ADL flat were marked on the floor, hence avoiding the distractions of furniture, carpet edges, door frames, door thresholds, and walls. Participants were given a choice to participate in any of these; this facilitated their recruitment as users of walking aids proved to be reluctant to commit to three assessments from the start, two of which required travel to the university. For each assessment participants were asked to walk common household distances (e.g. to walk from the lounge to the kitchen as if to make a cup of tea) with an instrumented pick-up walker and/or a front-wheeled walker, in accordance with what they generally use at home and set to their own walking frame's height.

### Massively parallel functional testing of MSH2 missense variants conferring Lynch syndrome risk [^84e7c063]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2021). Medium credibility.

Sequence data processing

Shotgun sequencing reads were aligned to a set of MSH2 cDNA sequences with each codon sequentially replaced with "NNN" using bbmapin semi-perfect mode, to identify reads containing at most one mutated codon with between one and three edits. Custom python scripts converted the resulting alignments to a per-sample table of counts for every possible codon mutation. For tile-seq libraries, paired reads were overlapped and error-corrected with PEAR v.0.9.6; only perfectly matching pairs were used. For each tile, all possible single-codon mutation sequences were enumerated, and the count of reads exactly matching each mutant sequence was tabulated. Reads with additional mutations or sequencing errors were discarded. Barc-seq reads were clustered with starcode v.1.3to define and count unique barcodes. To determine the number of distinct barcodes present, robust to sequencing or amplification artifacts, we ranked clustered barcode groups by read count and determined the minimum number of barcodes for which all equally or more abundant barcodes cumulatively accounted for ≥ 90% of the total read counts.

### Healthy housing reference manual [^175aa821]. CDC (2006). Medium credibility.

Rural water supplies — well construction and protection guidance states that 15% of people in the United States are on individual water supply systems, and a table outlines well types and dimensions; for example, Driven wells have depth 0–50 with diameter 1.25 to 2 inches, and Drilled (rotary type) wells have depth 0–1,000 with diameter 4 to 24 inches. To help assure potability, drainage should be away from a well, the casings of the well should be sealed with grout, and research suggests that a minimum of 10 feet of soil is essential to filter unwanted biologic organisms; wells should be protected from surface water entering directly into the top of the well, groundwater entering below ground level without filtering through at least 10 feet of earth, and surface water entering the space between the well casing and surrounding soil. Additional considerations include that in areas with karst topography, wells of any type are a health risk because of the long distances that both chemical and biologic contaminants can travel, that a well should be located in such a way that it is accessible for maintenance, inspection, and pump or pipe replacement when necessary, and that driven wells are typically installed in sand or soil and do not penetrate base rock.

### PICS / AEPC / APPCS / CSANZ / SCAI / SOLACI: expert consensus statement on cardiac Catheterization for pediatric patients and adults with congenital heart Disease [^da19455d]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2024). High credibility.

Pediatric and congenital cardiac catheterization laboratory (PCCL) layout and size — procedure rooms and support spaces are specified with exact dimensions and requirements: the optimal size for a cardiac cath lab procedure room is 32 feet (11 m) in length and 24 feet (7.3 m) in width with 14 feet (4.3 m) high ceilings, and PCCL procedure rooms should have a size of 1000 ft^2 (~93 m^2) or even larger to support complex care including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). An extra-long (6.5 ft or 2 m) table is necessary, shielding needs to be installed so that it is not cumbersome to move or utilize, and space should also be provided to store protective aprons. There must be sufficient clear space around the patient for staff to work safely and to transport the patient while maintaining a flat supine position, and when procedures are performed with an anesthesiologist there must be adequate space at the head of the table for the anesthesia team and their equipment, including wall attachments for medical air, oxygen, and suction, as well as for the delivery of inhalational anesthetics. Around the fixed equipment, there needs to be sufficient space for pressure recording equipment (including wires and connections), an extra equipment table for hybrid or valve procedures, a resuscitation cart/defibrillator, machines to analyze saturation and blood gas data, a power injector for contrast, adjustable spotlights or OR lights, and electronic monitors. The procedure room alone does not provide all that is needed; supporting rooms should be positioned immediately adjacent to the main cath lab room, including a control room, and a control room adjoining the laboratory is essential; the control room must have adequate space (ideally 200 square feet (19 square meters)) and uninterrupted lines of sight between the recording staff member and the procedural team at the table is an essential requirement for any PCCL. A fluoroscopy equipment support room is also described, as modern fluoroscopy equipment requires a relatively large power supply within a temperature-controlled space to allow it to function optimally, and this space requirement should not reduce the footprint required for the procedure room.

### Frail older people ageing in place alone and their perception of the built environment in rural and urban sites: a mixed-methods study [^872324b7]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The built environment

The home

The respondents have been living in the current home for a very long period (even over 40 years). Homes are mainly own properties of seniors (especially rural sites), have a medium size (five-six rooms), and independent radiators (mainly rural sites, where also stove and fireplace are present) (Supplementary File 3, Table 4). Narratives better underscore these characteristics.

I have lived here for 50 years, since I got married. (Urb-7)

I have lived here for 45 years, since my daughter was born. (Rur-6)

In particular, the homes are perceived as too large, with consequently too expensive running and repairing costs, which leads to waivers. Also, a winter cooling, especially at rural sites, needs to be managed by combining more types of heating.

The home is medium but however very large for me, as I live alone. In winter it is cold, so I spend a lot heating it. (Urb-18)

I have radiators with independent heating, but also a wood stove. (Rur-4)

The Building

The majority of respondents live on the first-second floors (that is necessary when some functional limitations hamper mobility) of both small-medium and large buildings, with those in urban site also inhabiting higher floors and edifices containing even more than 10 apartments. Older people in rural sites are concentrated in constructions of two-four flats, and in single/independent dwellings. Relations with neighbours living in the same building are reported above all good and at least civil, even though some cases of bad (only at urban site) and non-existent/superficial relationships (mainly at rural sites) emerged (Supplementary File 3, Table 5). Quotations well support and clarify that, at both sites, a sense of loneliness following the lack of old "historic neighbours", and the absence of contacts with new young people, are perceived.

Two young people live in my building who are almost never there. I am alone in this place, since I have no relationship with anyone. (Rur-5)

There are civil relationships, good evenings and good mornings are enough, since everyone is on their own business. The old neighbours are no longer there. Currently I have a couple of young neighbours who are never there because they work. (Urb-15)

### A need to improve the assessment of environmental hazards for falls on stairs and in bathrooms: results of a scoping review [^f0c6ef22]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Stage 2

Most checklists assessed solely fall-related environmental hazards; a quarter of them (n = 10) were imbedded in a checklist designed to also capture non-fall related hazards. As shown in Tables 2 and 4, checklists varied greatly in their length and in the number of bathroom and stair items assessed. Checklists differed with respect to what rooms were assessed (e.g. all bathrooms or bathroom most often used), whether or not outdoor hazards were assessed, and how responses were coded. Some hazards were assessed using dichotomous response categories (e.g.; present/absent); others were coded as continuous variables (e.g.; number of stairs/steps).

Table 4
Bathroom and stair locations included in checklists and range and average number of items evaluated (n = 42 checklists)

Range and average are shown only for tools including 1 or more assessment item in location

Person-environment fit

Most checklists did not assess person-environment fit. There were a few exceptions. Examples of items that assessed person-environment fit included either participants' self-reports or assessors' observations of difficulties (or lack or thereof) walking from room to room, over different floor surfaces; climbing and descending stairs/steps; transferring from beds, chairs, and toilets; and getting in and out of bathtubs or showers. Notably, the Housing Enabler Instrument assesses the environment and older adults' functional limitations separately. Uniquely, these authors provide an analytic matrix and a software program to examine the gap between the environment and the person's limitations.

Summary of key findings related to bathrooms

Thirty-nine checklists assessed bathrooms. Few checklists indicated which bathroom to assess when there were more than one in the home. As shown in Table 5, a majority of checklists (n = 25, 63%) used mostly subjective items to assess hazards in bathrooms. For instance, they assessed an "awkward toilet seat", or "slippery floor". Similarly, over three quarters of checklists (n = 30, 77%) assessed primarily non-structural hazards such as non-skid mats, abrasive strips in the bath or shower, or objects on the bathroom floor. The most frequently assessed structural hazard was the absence of grab bars.

Hyperthermia risk factors and home heat mitigation — According to the National Institute on Aging (NIA), lifestyle factors can increase the risk for hyperthermia, including unbearably hot living quarters in homes without fans or air conditioners, and to help avert the problem, residents should open windows at night; create cross-ventilation by opening windows on two sides of the building; cover windows when they are exposed to direct sunlight and keep curtains, shades, or blinds drawn during the hottest part of the day. Additional factors include lack of transportation that prevents people without fans or air conditioners from going to shopping malls, movie theaters, and libraries to cool off, inadequate or inoperable windows with many homes worldwide lacking fans for cooling as noted during the 2003 heat wave in France, and overdressing whereby older people may not dress appropriately in hot weather.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine guidelines on family-centered care for adult ICUs: 2024 [^248a1d93]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Physical ICU design — best practice and supporting evidence: Best practice statement. We recommend ICUs use family support zones or incorporate supportive features to meet family needs during patients' ICU stays, and family needs described in the literature include rest spaces, areas for personal care, spaces to interact with staff for sensitive and confidential discussions, and room to sit comfortably at the bedside of the patient. The panel identified 20 observational studies of family experiences with ICU design, with multiple studies reporting pre-post improvements in family satisfaction measures due to single bedrooms, and provision of family support zones with sleeping surfaces increasing the proportion of families staying at the bedside overnight; other features reported by families to improve satisfaction or increase presence or engagement were larger room size, seating areas, natural light, and low noise. Narrative reports on common family areas found qualities that better supported families included adequate seating, availability of vending machines, close proximity to the ICU, natural light, and presence of natural plants; families also voiced the need for consultation rooms for meetings in which privacy was desired or for which family preference was not to talk within patients' rooms, and given this indirect evidence, the panel made a best practice statement per GRADE guidance supporting the inclusion of family areas in room design and supportive features for families in ICUs.

### Beds, overlays and mattresses for treating pressure ulcers [^a01cc3eb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Pressure ulcers (also known as pressure injuries, pressure sores, decubitus ulcers and bed sores) are localised injuries to the skin or underlying soft tissue, or both, caused by unrelieved pressure, shear or friction. Beds, overlays or mattresses are widely used with the aim of treating pressure ulcers.

Objectives

To assess the effects of beds, overlays and mattresses on pressure ulcer healing in people with pressure ulcers of any stage, in any setting.

Search Methods

In November 2019, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta-analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials that allocated participants of any age to pressure-redistributing beds, overlays or mattresses. Comparators were any beds, overlays or mattresses that were applied for treating pressure ulcers.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently assessed studies using predetermined inclusion criteria. We carried out data extraction, 'Risk of bias' assessment using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and the certainty of the evidence assessment according to Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations methodology.

Main Results

We included 13 studies (972 participants) in the review. Most studies were small (median study sample size: 72 participants). The average age of participants ranged from 64.0 to 86.5 years (median: 82.7 years) and all studies recruited people with existing pressure ulcers (the baseline ulcer area size ranging from 4.2 to 18.6 cm 2, median 6.6 cm 2). Participants were recruited from acute care settings (six studies) and community and long-term care settings (seven studies). Of the 13 studies, three (224 participants) involved surfaces that were not well described and therefore could not be classified. Additionally, six (46.2%) of the 13 studies presented findings which were considered at high overall risk of bias. We synthesised data for four comparisons in the review: alternating pressure (active) air surfaces versus foam surfaces; reactive air surfaces versus foam surfaces; reactive water surfaces versus foam surfaces, and a comparison between two types of alternating pressure (active) air surfaces. We summarise key findings for these four comparisons below. (1) Alternating pressure (active) air surfaces versus foam surfaces: we are uncertain if there is a difference between alternating pressure (active) air surfaces and foam surfaces in the proportion of participants whose pressure ulcers completely healed (two studies with 132 participants; the reported risk ratio (RR) in one study was 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 3.58). There is also uncertainty for the outcomes of patient comfort (one study with 83 participants) and adverse events (one study with 49 participants). These outcomes have very low-certainty evidence. Included studies did not report time to complete ulcer healing, health-related quality of life, or cost effectiveness. (2) Reactive air surfaces versus foam surfaces: it is uncertain if there is a difference in the proportion of participants with completely healed pressure ulcers between reactive air surfaces and foam surfaces (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.80; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 156 participants; low-certainty evidence). When time to complete pressure ulcer healing is considered using a hazard ratio, data from one small study (84 participants) suggests a greater hazard for complete ulcer healing on reactive air surfaces (hazard ratio 2.66, 95% CI 1.34 to 5.17; low-certainty evidence). These results are sensitive to the choice of outcome measure so should be interpreted as uncertain. We are also uncertain whether there is any difference between these surfaces in patient comfort responses (1 study, 72 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and in adverse events (2 studies, 156 participants; low-certainty evidence). There is low-certainty evidence that reactive air surfaces may cost an extra 26 US dollars for every ulcer-free day in the first year of use (1 study, 87 participants). Included studies did not report health-related quality of life. (3) Reactive water surfaces versus foam surfaces: it is uncertain if there is a difference between reactive water surfaces and foam surfaces in the proportion of participants with healed pressure ulcers (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.63; 1 study, 101 participants) and in adverse events (1 study, 120 participants). All these have very low-certainty evidence. Included studies did not report time to complete ulcer healing, patient comfort, health-related quality of life, or cost effectiveness. (4) Comparison between two types of alternating pressure (active) air surfaces: it is uncertain if there is a difference between Nimbus and Pegasus alternating pressure (active) air surfaces in the proportion of participants with healed pressure ulcers, in patient comfort responses and in adverse events: each of these outcomes had four studies (256 participants) but very low-certainty evidence. Included studies did not report time to complete ulcer healing, health-related quality of life, or cost effectiveness.

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain about the relative effects of most different pressure-redistributing surfaces for pressure ulcer healing (types directly compared are alternating pressure air surfaces versus foam surfaces, reactive air surfaces versus foam surfaces, reactive water surfaces versus foam surfaces, and Nimbus versus Pegasus alternating pressure (active) air surfaces). There is also uncertainty regarding the effects of these different surfaces on the outcomes of comfort and adverse events. However, people using reactive air surfaces may be more likely to have pressure ulcers completely healed than those using foam surfaces over 37.5 days' follow-up, and reactive air surfaces may cost more for each ulcer-free day than foam surfaces. Future research in this area could consider the evaluation of alternating pressure air surfaces versus foam surfaces as a high priority. Time-to-event outcomes, careful assessment of adverse events and trial-level cost-effectiveness evaluation should be considered in future studies. Further review using network meta-analysis will add to the findings reported here.

### Tumour-infiltrating FOXP3 (+) lymphocytes are associated with cytotoxic immune responses and good clinical outcome in oestrogen receptor-negative breast cancer [^75621858]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Results

High levels of FOXP3 + TIL are associated with favourable clinical outcome in ER– breast cancer

FOXP3 + TIL were detectable in 143 of 175 (82%) assessable tumours. The median number of FOXP3 + TIL was 9 per mm 2, with respective lower and upper quartiles of 3 per mm 2 and 27 per mm 2. FOXP3 + lymphocytes were present throughout tumours (Figure 1A), with a tendency for stromal localisation (Figure 1B). When patients were categorised based on the presence or absence of recurrent disease at the time of final follow-up, FOXP3 + TIL were significantly more abundant in the disease-free subgroup (P = 0.0033, Figure 1C).

To establish a FOXP3 cutoff value for survival analysis, we used X-Tile software (as described in Materials and methods) and identified an optimal cutpoint of 18 FOXP3 + TIL per mm 2. Cases with ⩾18 FOXP3 + TIL per mm 2 had significantly prolonged RFS in both the training (HR = 0.438, 95% CI 0.244–0.789; P = 0.0059; Figure 1D) and validation cohorts (HR = 0.490, 95% CI 0.275–0.873; P = 0.0155). In the combined total cohort, the 10-year RFS rates were 59% and 24% for FOXP3-high and FOXP3-low patients, respectively (HR = 0.461, 95% CI 0.306–0.696; P = 0.0002). The cutoff value of 18 per mm 2 was used to define FOXP3 status in all subsequent analyses.

To confirm the association between FOXP3 + TIL and patient outcome, we assessed several cutoff values that centred on 18 per mm 2 (Supplementary Table S2). FOXP3 + TIL were significantly associated with RFS at cutoff values ranging from 5 per mm 2 to 30 per mm 2. The pattern of stromal vs intraepithelial infiltration did not significantly influence the clinical relevance of FOXP3 + TIL (data not shown).

### Healthy housing reference manual [^3fe4030a]. CDC (2006). Medium credibility.

Pool content turnover rate — definition, 6-hour standard, and calculation are detailed. The turnover rate is the number of times a pool's contents can be filtered though its filtration equipment in a 24-hour period, and a 6-hour turnover rate will result in 98% clarification if the pool is properly designed. A typical-use pool should have a pump and filtration system capable of pumping the entire contents of the pool though the filters every 6 hours; to determine compliance, use Turnover rate = pool volume (gallons)/flow rate×60 (minutes in hour). A sample calculation shows Turnover rate = 90,000 (gallons in pool)/ 180 gallons per minute×60 (minutes in hour), yielding an 8.3-hour turnover rate = 90,000 (pool volume in gallons)/10,800, which would not meet the required turnover rate of 6 hours.

### SWITCH: Al wakra hospital journey to 90% hand hygiene practice compliance, 2011–2015 [^d88b31c1]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Third Strategy: Shape the Path. What looks like a people problem is often a situation problem. We call the situation the "Path". When you shape the Path, you make change more likely, no matter what's happening with the Rider and Elephant.

This is the physical dimension, having all the appliances and item or equipment available to staff to ensure that it is easy to undertake hand hygiene when and where it should be done according to healthcare activity. A joint review of hand washing sinks and hand rub allocations were undertaken by Engineering Department and IPC teams by the end of the first quarter of 2012. The goal of the review was to have the hand washing stations convenient for nurse stations and patient bed areas. The IPC team recommended that where a single room is used, a hands-free hand washing station should be provided within each room. Meanwhile, in a multiple bed room, every patient bed should be within 20 feet (6 meters) of a hands-free hand washing station. Hand washing stations should be no closer than 3 feet (0.9 meter) from a patient bed or clean supply storage. It is also highlighted that hand washing sinks should be large enough to control splashing and designed to avoid standing or retained water. As recommended by the American Institute of Architects (AIA)…, the minimum dimensions for a hand washing sink are 24 inches wide × 16 inches front to back × 10 inches deep (61 cm × 41 cm × 25 cm) from the bottom of the sink to the top of its rim. With the purpose of acting as a continuous reminder and guide, a space for hand washing instructions shall be provided above all sinks. Walls adjacent to hand washing sinks shall be constructed of non-porous material. Space shall also be provided for soap and towel dispensers and for appropriate trash receptacles. Towel dispensers shall operate so that only the towel itself need be touched in the process of dispensing, and constructed in such a fashion.

### DNA methylation analysis reveals epimutation hotspots in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy-associated laminopathies [^45e1b397]. Clinical Epigenetics (2021). Medium credibility.

Statistical analyses

All statistical tests were performed through R (Version 2.15.2). Data distributions were first tested for normality using the Shapiro–Wilks test. The Kruskal–Wallis and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were performed for datasets with non-normal distribution.

Quadrant count ratio (QCR) was calculated as, where n(Quadrant) is the number of observations present within a given quadrant, and N total is the total number of observations across all four quadrants.

Odds ratio (OR) analyses were performed to determine the significance of DMR association to particular chromatin contexts (for example, distance from a gene's transcriptional start site (TSS), histone modifications, and ChromHMM annotations). CpGs (filtered for ≥ 5 × depth) captured in our RRBS study for each sample were merged according to the three categories previously described (all samples, Family A samples, Family C samples), thus creating three categories of background CpGs. The resulting background CpG files were then intersected with one of the six DMR files previously generated (Hyper and hypomethylated DMRs for shared, Family A, and Family C). Subsequently, the number of DMR-filtered CpGs and background CpGs that intersected with a particular context of interest were compared. For distance from a gene's TSS, CpGs were intersected with bins of distance (from 0–1 Kb up to 10–50 Kb) in both up and downstream directions relative to each gene's genomic orientation. For histone modifications and ChromHMM annotations, CpGs were simply intersected with the Chip-seq peak tiles or annotated tiles. OR was then calculated as follows: where a = the number of CpGs that fall within a DMR and within the context of interest, b = the number of CpGs that fall within DMRs and outside of the context of interest, c = the number of CpGs that fall outside of DMRs and within the context of interest, d = the number of CpGs that fall outside of DMRs and outside of the context of interest. The logarithmic OR value (logOR) was then reported for each context of interest. Fisher's exact test was used to determine significance of odds ratios.

See, " How do I store HumatroPen 6 mg?" in Section 1 of this Instructions for Use for more information.
When it is time for the next scheduled dose, go to Section 3, and repeat Steps 3A through 3D.
When using the Hidden Needle Cover with HumatroPen 6 mg, repeat steps 1 to 10 of the Hidden Needle Cover Instructions for Use.

Commonly asked questions:

Do I need to perform the New Cartridge Setup before every dose?
No. You only need to perform the New Cartridge Set-up 1 time for each Cartridge, just before a new Cartridge is used for the first time.
The purpose of the New Cartridge Set-up is to make sure the HumatroPen 6 mg with an attached HUMATROPE 6 mg Cartridge are ready to use.
If you repeat the New Cartridge Set-up before each routine dose, you may run out of HUMATROPE early. The small amount of medicine used in the New Cartridge Set-up will not affect the amount of HUMATROPE in the Cartridge.
What should I do if the Cartridge label and Pen do not match?
Do not use the Pen if the Cartridge strength on the HUMATROPE Cartridge label does not match the number on the Pen's front housing. This is important to make sure the correct dose of HUMATROPE is given.
Contact your healthcare provider for a replacement.
What should I do if the HUMATROPE is not clear?
Do not use the Pen if the liquid is cloudy or contains particles. Contact your healthcare provider or call Lilly at 1-800-545-5979 or go to www.humatrope.com.
Why are there air bubbles in the Cartridge?
Air bubbles may remain in the Cartridge after mixing.

### Healthy housing reference manual [^69100d73]. CDC (2006). Medium credibility.

New York City tenement housing conditions — late 19th-century dumbbell tenements were typically five stories with limited sanitation, and crowding was extensive. These tenements were "typically five stories, with a basement and no elevator (elevators were not required for any building of less than six stories)," and "the public hallways only contained one or two toilets and a sink." Boarding was common: "44,000 families rented space to boarders in New York in 1890, with this increasing to 164,000 families in 1910." In the early 1890s the city had "a population of more than 1 million, of which 70% were residents of multifamily dwellings," and "80% lived in tenements consisting mostly of dumbbell tenements." Earlier, "a series of tenement fires in 1860 in New York" led to terms such as "death-trap and fire-trap."

### 2018 ACC / HRS / NASCI / SCAI / SCCT expert consensus document on optimal use of ionizing radiation in cardiovascular imaging: best practices for safety and effectiveness [^aaaedede]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2018). Medium credibility.

X-ray imaging field size and system positioning — The product of the total dose and the imaging field size determines the total amount of radiation energy (expressed as the KAP in Gy-cm2) that the patient receives, and the total KAP determines the patient's stochastic risk associated with the exposure. In addition to the examination's total number of pulses and the detector dose per pulse, the KAP is affected by 2 additional parameters that are under the operator's control: the imaging field size selected and system positioning. Because scattered x-ray dose to the operator and nearby personnel is directly related to KAP, the operator has a personal interest to minimize KAP. Current x-ray systems link brightness stabilization detection to a collimator position that samples only the detector area receiving the collimated x-ray beam, so the dose per pulse to the detector is not affected by collimator position, whereas the KAP is directly related to the size of the imaged area. At a given detector zoom mode, smaller image areas sizes deliver proportionately smaller KAPs, and reducing exposed field size by collimation to the smallest size necessary minimizes the KAP that the patient receives. Detector dose per pulse increases as the zoom magnification increases.

### Personalised, GIS-based counselling to promote habitual walking in mobility-limited and chronically ill older adults: protocol of the MOBITEC-routes randomised controlled trial [^922b1399]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The tool splits the screen into a left and a right pane (Fig. 3). The right pane shows the map including the individual walking routes and markers. The left pane guides the user (i.e. the exercise professional) through the process of setting up new participants and routes. The tool is operated by the exercise professional in the presence of the participant, both sitting in front of a computer screen. In short, the process is as follows: 1. define a new participant (or selecting an existing participant), 2. enter the participant's step length and walking speed (assessed within the first face-to-face consultation) and potentially a correction factor for expected real-life vs. laboratory walking (the pre-set correction factor is 1), 3. mark the participant's home location on the map, 4. draw the self-perceived neighbourhood polygon on the map, 5. select markers and place them on the map, and 6. co-create routes. Inspired by other authors' perception-based, participatory neighbourhood definitions, we define "self-perceived neighbourhood" as "[…] the area that feels familiar to you and where you spend most of your time moving about in daily life. It includes your home and extends to the places you regularly move through or visit, such as parks, shops or other locations where you carry out routine activities. Think about the routes you travel most often, the spaces you recognise and use, and the boundaries that define this familiar area for you.". Besides the marker for the home location, there are three categories of markers to choose from: 1. destinations for leisure walks (three different markers): park/forest/green area, shore/blue area, pleasant place; 2. destinations for utilitarian walks (seven different markers): family/friends, culture/education/religion, groceries/shopping, sports/exercise, medical facility, restaurant/café, volunteering/work; and 3. others (three different markers): change of transportation mode, break, unpleasant place/barrier. The user can choose from four different colour-coded transportation modes when drawing the routes: 1. walking (magenta), 2. public transport (light blue), 3. private car (dark blue), and 4. bicycle/e-bike (orange). When a route is created, the tool automatically calculates the distance as well as expected duration and number of steps. Route plans are printed, placed in a binder, and handed out to the participant. For each walking route, a separate map is created and printed.

### Drinking water advisory communication toolbox. updated 2013 [^5d8734f1]. CDC (2013). Medium credibility.

Boil water advisory — household water preparation and disinfection steps include boiling instructions and bleach-based alternatives when boiling is not possible. For boiling, "Once the water reaches a rolling boil, let it boil for 1 minute". If you are unable to boil, the document states to "disinfect it instead" and to "Use unscented bleach (bleach that does not have an added scent)". For clear tap water, add "1/8 teaspoon (8 drops or about 0.75 milliliters)" of unscented household liquid bleach to "1 gallon (16 cups)" of water and "Mix well and wait 30 minutes or more before drinking". For cloudy water, first "Filter water using clean cloth", then add "1/4 teaspoon (16 drops or 1.5 milliliters)" per "1 gallon (16 cups)" and again "Mix well and wait 30 minutes or more before drinking". For container sanitation, make a sanitizing solution by mixing "1 teaspoon (5 milliliters) of unscented household liquid bleach in 1 quart (32 ounces, 4 cups, or about 1 liter) of water" and "Pour this sanitizing solution into a clean storage container and shake well, making sure that the solution coats the entire inside of the container".

### Summary of guidance for public health strategies to address high levels of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and related deaths, December 2020 [^13b39dcf]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

In the 10 months since the first confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in the United States on January 20, 2020, approximately 13.8 million cases and 272,525 deaths have been reported in the United States. On October 30, the number of new cases reported in the United States in a single day exceeded 100,000 for the first time, and by December 2 had reached a daily high of 196,227. * With colder weather, more time spent indoors, the ongoing U.S. holiday season, and silent spread of disease, with approximately 50% of transmission from asymptomatic persons, the United States has entered a phase of high-level transmission where a multipronged approach to implementing all evidence-based public health strategies at both the individual and community levels is essential. This summary guidance highlights critical evidence-based CDC recommendations and sustainable strategies to reduce COVID-19 transmission. These strategies include 1) universal face mask use, 2) maintaining physical distance from other persons and limiting in-person contacts, 3) avoiding nonessential indoor spaces and crowded outdoor spaces, 4) increasing testing to rapidly identify and isolate infected persons, 5) promptly identifying, quarantining, and testing close contacts of persons with known COVID-19, 6) safeguarding persons most at risk for severe illness or death from infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, 7) protecting essential workers with provision of adequate personal protective equipment and safe work practices, 8) postponing travel, 9) increasing room air ventilation and enhancing hand hygiene and environmental disinfection, and 10) achieving widespread availability and high community coverage with effective COVID-19 vaccines. In combination, these strategies can reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission, long-term sequelae or disability, and death, and mitigate the pandemic's economic impact. Consistent implementation of these strategies improves health equity, preserves health care capacity, maintains the function of essential businesses, and supports the availability of in-person instruction for kindergarten through grade 12 schools and preschool. Individual persons, households, and communities should take these actions now to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission from its current high level. These actions will provide a bridge to a future with wide availability and high community coverage of effective vaccines, when safe return to more everyday activities in a range of settings will be possible.
