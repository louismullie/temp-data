## Question

posterior knee pain differential

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a differential diagnosis and workup plan for posterior knee pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial history and red flag screening. Then, I should organize the differential by anatomic location and pathophysiology. Next, I will review key examination maneuvers and their diagnostic accuracy, followed by an imaging algorithm aligned with ACR guidance. Finally, I will consider special scenarios such as post-surgical states and referred or neurogenic pain, and close with a concise diagnostic pathway and safety netting recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the foundational approach to the history and red flags, because missing an urgent diagnosis would be unacceptable. Posterior knee pain evaluation starts with onset, mechanism, precise location, swelling, mechanical symptoms, instability, fever, or erythema; inability to bear weight after trauma, acute effusion with severe pain, fever with a hot joint, or Ottawa Knee Rule positivity should prompt immediate imaging and possible urgent referral, and I should double-check that the Ottawa criteria and age thresholds are applied correctly in acute trauma settings [^11497fDv] [^115Uzd9s].

> Hold on, let me think about how to frame the differential by anatomic region and mechanism so I do not overlook key posterior etiologies. Pure posterior pain after trauma raises PCL or posterolateral corner injuries, twisting injuries can implicate posterior horn meniscal tears, fullness suggests a cyst, posterolateral snapping implicates popliteus or biceps femoris tendinopathy, while subacute to chronic pain suggests osteoarthritis or inflammatory arthropathy; neurogenic saphenous neuritis and referred hip or lumbar pathology can mimic medial or posterior knee pain, so I need to ensure I ask about spine and hip symptoms too [^113jfkda] [^1173sAtq] [^112CRL3g].

> I will now examine the high-priority traumatic ligamentous causes, starting with the PCL. Typical mechanisms include a posteriorly directed force to the proximal tibia, hyperflexion, or hyperextension; isolated PCL tears may have posterior pain with minimal instability, and the posterior drawer test has moderate sensitivity and high specificity, although I should confirm that my technique is correct to avoid false negatives; MRI is the definitive modality when internal derangement is suspected and X-rays help exclude fractures or posterior tibial avulsion [^112fG382] [^114hznr3] [^114iToWE].

> Next, I should review the posterolateral corner, because it is often missed and can coexist with PCL tears. Mechanisms include varus stress, hyperextension, and external rotation; key findings are posterolateral pain, varus thrust gait, and increased external rotation on the dial test, and I need to check varus stress testing for lateral collateral integrity; MRI can define the extent of PLC injury and associated meniscal or chondral damage, while high-resolution ultrasound may aid evaluation of superficial PLC structures but has limitations for deep joint assessment [^111ty6Xj] [^1173sAtq].

> Wait, let me verify my approach to meniscal pathology, especially posterior horn tears that can present with posterior joint line pain and mechanical catching or locking. I initially focused on McMurray based on traditional teaching, but I should correct myself: AAFP 2018 recommends the Thessaly test over McMurray or isolated joint line tenderness for suspected meniscal injury; that said, McMurray still has useful accuracy data and joint line tenderness can be supportive, and MRI remains the gold standard when clinical suspicion is high or surgery is considered [^11497fDv] [^113jfkda] [^114iToWE].

> Let me consider cystic lesions now, because a Baker's cyst can produce posterior fullness and even calf pain if it ruptures. Ultrasound is a pragmatic first-line tool to confirm a popliteal cyst and assess effusions, while MRI helps when intra-articular pathology is suspected or when features are atypical; proximal tibiofibular joint cysts can cause posterolateral pain and occasional peroneal nerve findings, so I should examine for neurologic deficits if symptoms suggest neuropathy [^112kWAdx].

> I should review tendinous sources of posterior or posterolateral pain, including popliteus tendinopathy or snapping, as well as biceps femoris tendinopathy at the fibular head. Dynamic ultrasound can visualize snapping phenomena and guide targeted treatment, while MRI demonstrates tendinopathic changes and helps exclude concomitant intra-articular pathology; I need to palpate the popliteus and fibular head insertions carefully during resisted maneuvers to localize symptoms [^111WYvSN] [^112kWAdx].

> Now, let me reassess degenerative and inflammatory etiologies, because chronic posterior pain often reflects joint disease rather than focal tendon or cyst pathology. In adults over 45 with activity-related pain and brief morning stiffness, tibiofemoral OA is likely, with weight-bearing radiographs as first-line imaging per ACR chronic knee pain guidelines; persistent symptoms with non-diagnostic radiographs can warrant MRI, while systemic features, prolonged morning stiffness, or polyarticular involvement should prompt consideration of inflammatory arthritis and appropriate labs or referral [^112U1Un6] [^113jfkda] [^1173sAtq].

> But wait, what if the posterior or posteromedial symptoms are neuropathic rather than intra-articular. Saphenous neuritis can mimic meniscal or OA pain with burning allodynia along its distribution, often post-surgical or after trauma; a diagnostic local anesthetic injection can confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment, so I should double-check for sensory changes and Tinel-like signs along the adductor canal and medial knee course [^1135EDze].

> I need to ensure I do not miss referred pain sources, especially in adolescents and young adults where hip pathology can present as knee pain. Hip disorders such as SCFE or Perthes, and lumbar radiculopathy, should be considered when knee examination is inconclusive or when gait and hip range are abnormal; careful hip and spine assessment is part of a complete knee evaluation to prevent diagnostic delay [^112CRL3g] [^116W4zw6].

> Let me now examine post-surgical scenarios, because posterior knee pain after TKA can arise from multiple mechanisms, including posterior capsular innervation and implant-related issues. Analgesic strategies such as adductor canal block combined with IPACK reduce early posterior pain and may reduce short-term chronic pain incidence, and sciatic nerve block techniques can also reduce early posterior pain after TKA; implant-related complications like patellar clunk are typically anterior but worth recognizing for complete context, and the PCL retention versus sacrifice debate in TKA affects biomechanics without a consistently superior pain outcome across trials [^114yFaBu] [^116x49ND] [^1171bCh9] [^117JdCCx] [^116z4axh].

> Next, I should review the imaging algorithm and double-check it aligns with ACR criteria. In acute trauma with focal tenderness, effusion, or inability to bear weight, obtain knee radiographs first, and if radiographs are negative but internal derangement or occult fracture is suspected, proceed to MRI; in chronic pain over six weeks, start with weight-bearing radiographs and escalate to MRI or CT if radiographs are non-diagnostic or symptoms persist despite conservative care; ultrasound is valuable for effusions, cysts, and tendon pathology, and can be used as a rapid, cost-effective extension of the exam, while remembering its operator dependence and limitations for deep structures [^117ERmUi] [^114iToWE] [^112U1Un6] [^112kWAdx] [^1173sAtq].

> Hold on, I should tie this together into a practical bedside sequence so nothing is missed. Start with red flag screening and Ottawa Knee Rule application in trauma, localize pain precisely to posterior, posteromedial, or posterolateral compartments, test for PCL and PLC with posterior drawer, sag sign, dial and varus stress tests, screen meniscal pathology with Thessaly, and palpate for cysts and tendon insertions while considering neurogenic and referred sources; choose imaging based on acuity and suspected pathology, beginning with radiographs when appropriate and using ultrasound for cysts or tendons and MRI for internal derangement, and escalate care or refer urgently when infection, fracture, or instability is suspected [^11497fDv] [^115Uzd9s] [^114iToWE].

---

Posterior knee pain has a broad differential, including **PCL injury** (posterior drawer/Lachman, MRI) [^112fG382], **Baker's cyst** (palpable mass, ultrasound/MRI) [^1173sAtq], and **meniscal tears** (joint line tenderness, McMurray/Thessaly, MRI) [^11497fDv] [^114iToWE]. Other causes include **hamstring tendinopathy** (posterior thigh pain, resisted knee flexion), **popliteal artery aneurysm** (pulsatile mass, ultrasound), and **referred pain** from lumbar radiculopathy or hip pathology [^112CRL3g]. Evaluation should include history and physical examination, with imaging (MRI for internal derangement, ultrasound for cysts/vascular lesions, radiographs for bony pathology) [^114iToWE] [^112U1Un6] [^117KwPXg]. Management is diagnosis-specific, ranging from conservative care to surgery.

---

## Ligamentous injuries

For **posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury**, typically due to dashboard or hyperflexion mechanisms [^112fG382]; the posterior drawer and posterior sag tests are diagnostic [^11497fDv], and MRI confirms and grades the injury [^114iToWE]. For **posterolateral corner (PLC) injury**, often concomitant with PCL injury; varus stress, dial, and reverse pivot-shift tests assess instability [^111ty6Xj], and MRI defines the extent [^114iToWE].

---

## Meniscal injuries

For **posterior horn meniscal tears**, medial or lateral posterior horn tears cause posterior pain, especially with flexion; joint line tenderness and McMurray/Thessaly tests are helpful [^11497fDv], and MRI confirms [^114iToWE].

---

## Tendinous injuries

For **hamstring tendinopathy or tear**, semimembranosus or biceps femoris injuries cause posterior thigh/knee pain, worsened by resisted knee flexion; MRI confirms [^117KwPXg]. For **popliteus tendinopathy**, posterolateral pain is provoked by resisted internal rotation; MRI confirms [^112kWAdx] [^111WYvSN].

---

## Cystic lesions

For **Baker's cyst (popliteal cyst)**, posterior mass with swelling and tightness; ultrasound or MRI confirms [^1112oi79]. For **meniscal cyst**, posterior pain with a palpable mass; MRI confirms [^1112oi79] [^115sfCws].

---

## Neurovascular causes

For **popliteal artery aneurysm**, pulsatile mass with posterior pain; ultrasound or CT angiography confirms. For **tibial nerve entrapment**, posterior pain with paresthesia; nerve conduction studies confirm.

---

## Referred pain

For **lumbar radiculopathy**, posterior knee pain with back pain or neurologic symptoms; MRI of the lumbar spine confirms. For **hip pathology**, osteoarthritis or avascular necrosis can refer pain posteriorly; hip imaging confirms [^117KwPXg].

---

## Diagnostic approach

History and physical examination should assess for trauma, instability, swelling, and neurologic symptoms, and include **posterior drawer, McMurray, Thessaly, varus stress, and neurovascular examinations** [^1173sAtq] [^11497fDv]. Imaging includes **MRI** for internal derangement [^114iToWE], **ultrasound** for cysts/vascular lesions, and **radiographs** for bony pathology [^1173JbUm].

---

## Management strategies

Conservative management includes **rest, physical therapy, NSAIDs, and injections** for tendinous injuries, cysts, and mild ligamentous injuries [^113jfkda]. Surgical management options include **arthroscopy** for meniscal tears, **ligament reconstruction** for PCL/PLC injuries [^112fG382], and **excision** for persistent cysts [^115sfCws].

---

Posterior knee pain has a **broad differential**, including ligamentous, meniscal, tendinous, cystic, neurovascular, and referred causes. A **structured approach** with history, exam, and targeted imaging enables accurate diagnosis and management [^1173sAtq].

### Evolving evidence in the treatment of primary and recurrent posterior cruciate ligament injuries, part 1: Anatomy, biomechanics and diagnostics [^112fG382]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Low credibility.

A thorough and systematic diagnostic workup, including patient history, standardized clinical knee examination, and imaging, is essential for each patient to precisely identify PCL and concomitant ligamentous, meniscal, and cartilage injuries for appropriate and individualized treatment decision-making.

Obtaining detailed information about the patient's medical history, injury mechanism, chief complaint, as well as social, professional, and athletic demands, is crucial. Usually, patients presenting with PCL injuries are aged between 20 and 35 years and have a history of a high-energy trauma caused by a motor vehicle or sport-related injury. More precisely, a posterior directed force acting on the proximal tibia leads to posterior tibial translation, which ultimately causes a disruption of the PCL. Other injury mechanisms include hyperflexion and hyperextension, which is associated with a proximal tear location and anterior tibial plateau compression fractures. Excessive varus, valgus, internal, or external torque of the tibia are also injury mechanisms and may be related to concomitant injuries of the peripheral capsuloligamentous structures, menisci, and cartilage.

Clinically, patients primarily report pain or discomfort after an acute PCL injury. The pain commonly affects the patellofemoral, anteromedial, or posterior part of the knee and occurs during uphill or downhill walks. Unlike in ACL deficiency, patients with isolated PCL tears rarely report symptoms of instability. However, the perception of instability becomes more present in chronic and combined injuries.

### Posterolateral corner of the knee: An expert consensus statement on diagnosis, classification, treatment, and rehabilitation [^111ty6Xj]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2019). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to develop a statement on the diagnosis, classification, treatment, and rehabilitation concepts of posterolateral corner (PLC) injuries of the knee using a modified Delphi technique.

A working group of three individuals generated a list of statements relating to the diagnosis, classification, treatment, and rehabilitation of PLC injuries. This formed the basis of an initial survey for rating by an international group of experts. The PLC expert group, composed of 27 experts worldwide, was surveyed on three occasions to establish consensus on the inclusion/exclusion of each item. In addition to rating agreement, experts were invited to propose further items for inclusion or suggest modifications of existing items at each round. Pre-defined criteria were used to refine item lists after each survey. Statements reaching consensus in round three were included within the final consensus document.

Twenty-seven experts (100% response rate) completed three rounds of surveys. After three rounds, 29 items achieved consensus with over 75% agreement and less than 5% disagreement. Consensus was reached in 92% of the statements relating to the diagnosis of PLC injuries, 100% relating to classification, 70% relating to treatment, and 88% of items relating to rehabilitation statements, with an overall consensus of 81%.

This study has established a consensus statement relating to the diagnosis, classification, treatment, and rehabilitation of PLC injuries. Further research is needed to develop updated classification systems and a better understanding of the treatment and rehabilitation processes.

### Saphenous neuritis: A poorly understood cause of medial knee pain [^1135EDze]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2002). Low credibility.

Saphenous neuritis is a painful condition caused by either irritation or compression at the adductor canal or elsewhere along the course of the saphenous nerve. The condition may also be associated with surgical or nonsurgical trauma to the nerve, especially at the medial or anterior aspect of the knee. Saphenous neuritis can imitate other pathology around the knee, particularly a medial meniscal tear or osteoarthritis. Unrecognized saphenous neuritis can confuse the patient's clinical picture, complicate treatment, and compromise results.

As an isolated entity, saphenous neuritis may appear in conjunction with other common problems, such as osteoarthritis and patellofemoral pain syndrome, and it can have an indolent and protracted course. Its clinical appearance is characterized by allodynia along the course of the saphenous nerve. The diagnosis is confirmed by the relief of symptoms after injection of the affected area with a local anesthetic.

Initial treatment can include non-surgical symptomatic care, treatment of associated pathology, and diagnostic or therapeutic injections of local anesthetic. In recalcitrant cases, surgical decompression and neurectomy are potential options. The key to treatment is prompt recognition; palpation of the saphenous nerve should be part of every routine examination of the knee.

### Evaluation of patients presenting with knee pain: Part ii. Differential diagnosis [^112CRL3g]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Knee pain is a common presenting complaint with many possible causes. An awareness of certain patterns can help the family physician identify the underlying cause more efficiently. Teenage girls and young women are more likely to have patellar tracking problems such as patellar subluxation and patellofemoral pain syndrome, whereas teenage boys and young men are more likely to have knee extensor mechanism problems, such as tibial apophysitis (Osgood-Schlatter lesion) and patellar tendonitis. Referred pain resulting from hip joint pathology, such as slipped capital femoral epiphysis, also may cause knee pain.

Active patients are more likely to have acute ligamentous sprains and overuse injuries, such as pes anserine bursitis and medial plica syndrome. Trauma may result in acute ligamentous rupture or fracture, leading to acute knee joint swelling and hemarthrosis. Septic arthritis may develop in patients of any age, but crystal-induced inflammatory arthropathy is more likely in adults. Osteoarthritis of the knee joint is common in older adults.

### Effect of adductor canal block combined with infiltration between the popliteal artery and posterior capsular of the knee on chronic pain after total knee arthroplasty: a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1171bCh9]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). High credibility.

- **Discussion**: This single-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study showed that ACB combined with IPACK reduced the incidence of chronic postoperative pain 3 months after TKA in the context of a multimodal analgesia strategy (primary endpoint of the study).

The high incidence of chronic pain after TKA has always been the focus of attention. Many studies have explored its mechanism and possible influencing factors, but there are few randomized controlled trials on the effect of nerve block on chronic pain after TKA. Our study revealed that pain scores and the incidence of chronic postoperative pain were lower in the ACB + IPACK group at 1 and 3 months after TKA, which we attributed to better early pain control.

As shown in Fig. 3, from discharge from the PACU to 24 h after TKA, the NRS scores of the Ropivacaine group were statistically significantly lower than the controls, both in the anterior and posterior of the knee, and both at rest and in movement. It is worth noting that although the NRS score decreased in the Ropivacaine group at 24 h, whether this is truly a clinically beneficial reduction (i.e. a reduction within the minimal clinically important difference, MCID) deserves further investigation. As shown in past studies, MCID estimates based on different methods can vary widely.

Meanwhile, although there was a statistically significant difference in the incidence of chronic pain between the two groups 3 months after the operation, the 50% reduction we expected was not achieved, which may be due to sampling errors.

### Evaluation and treatment of knee pain: A review [^117KwPXg]. JAMA (2023). High credibility.

Knee pain can arise from a variety of causes.

- **Common causes**: Tendinitis, acute bursitis, knee osteoarthritis, knee injury, and gout are prevalent factors.

- **Infectious and inflammatory causes**: Rheumatic fever, Lyme disease, septic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, and axial spondyloarthritis can contribute to knee pain.

- **Structural and degenerative causes**: Ruptured Baker's cyst, Osgood-Schlatter disease, infrapatellar fat pad syndrome, patellar tendinitis, osteochondritis dissecans, meniscal pathology, chondromalacia patellae, and sinding-Larsen-Johannson disease can impact knee function.

- **Rheumatic and autoimmune conditions**: Rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and fibromyalgia may also be involved.

- **Neoplastic and metabolic causes**: Synovial sarcoma, osteosarcoma, tenosynovial giant cell tumor, calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease, and osteonecrosis are considered.

- **Other conditions**: Patellofemoral pain syndrome, iliotibial band syndrome, neuropathic arthropathy of the knee, and hemarthrosis are additional contributors to the complex etiology of knee pain.

### Different patient and activity-related characteristics result in different injury profiles for patients with anterior cruciate ligament and posterior cruciate ligament injuries [^113JkAbC]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). High credibility.

The most important findings in this study were the differences in injury profiles for patients with ACL and PCL injuries. An isolated ACL injury was more commonly found in males, while all other injury profiles of ACL, including combined injuries with meniscus, cartilage, and collateral ligament injuries, were more frequently observed in females compared with males. Moreover, a larger proportion of PCL injuries was found in females compared with males.

Concomitant injuries to the collateral ligaments and the articular cartilage were more prevalent in the PCL group compared with the ACL group. In contrast, ACL injuries more frequently occurred either in isolation or in combination with meniscal injuries. These findings are in agreement with previous studies reporting a higher incidence of various concomitant injuries in a population with PCL injuries, whereas ACL injuries tend to occur either in isolation or in conjunction with meniscal lesions. Furthermore, the higher occurrence of concomitant injuries in PCL-injured populations has previously been attributed to high-energy injury mechanisms, leading to more complex patterns of knee ligament injuries. In line with previous research, a high rate of traffic- and sports-related injury mechanisms has been reported in the population with a PCL injury, while ACL injuries most commonly occurred due to sports-related activities, especially pivoting sports.

Further differences in patient characteristics were noted between injury profiles of ACL and PCL injuries. A larger proportion of patients with combined injuries to the knee ligaments were observed in specific demographics, emphasizing the need for targeted prevention strategies.

### Painful patellar clunk or crepitation of contemporary knee prostheses [^117JdCCx]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2013). Low credibility.

Painful patellar clunk or crepitation (PCC) is a resurgent complication of contemporary posterior-stabilized total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The incidence, time to presentation, causes, and treatment of PCC remain controversial.
- **Questions/purposes**: We therefore (1) compared the incidence of PCC with five contemporary TKA designs, (2) evaluated the time to presentation, (3) identified possible etiologies, and (4) determined recurrence rate and change in knee functional scores after treatment for PCC.
- **Methods**: We reviewed 580 patients who had 826 posterior-stabilized TKAs involving five different designs. The incidences of PCC were compared among the prostheses. The knees were divided into two groups depending on the development of PCC, and possible etiologic factors of PCC, including prosthesis design and surgical or radiographic variables, were compared between groups. We investigated the onset time of PCC and evaluated treatment results by knee outcome scores. Minimum follow-up was 2.0 years (mean, 3.9 years; range, 2.0–9.8 years).
- **Results**: The PCC incidence was higher in the Press-Fit Condylar® Sigma® Rotating Platform/Rotating Platform-Flex Knee System (11 of 113 knees, 9.7%) than in the others (seven of 713 knees, 1.0%). Increased risk of PCC was associated with using a specific prosthesis and patellar retention. PCC occurred in all cases within a year after TKA (mean, 7.4 months). Arthroscopic treatment (16 knees) and patellar replacement (two knees) improved knee scores, with no recurrence observed over an average follow-up of 29 months.
- **Conclusions**: Prosthesis design and patellar retention were identified as significant factors influencing PCC incidence.

### Hands and knees posture in late pregnancy or labour for fetal malposition (lateral or posterior) [^112KZWw6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). High credibility.

Lateral and posterior positions of the baby's head (the back of the baby's head facing the mother's side or back) may be associated with more painful, prolonged, or obstructed labor and difficult delivery. It is possible that certain positions adopted by the mother may influence the baby's position.
- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of adopting a hands and knees maternal posture in late pregnancy or during labor when the presenting part of the fetus is in a lateral or posterior position compared with no intervention.
- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (July 2007) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 2).
- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials of hands and knees maternal posture compared to other postures or controls.
- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors assessed trial eligibility and quality.
- **Main results**: Three trials (2,794 women) were included. In one trial (100 women), four different postures (four groups of 20 women) were combined for the comparison with the control group of 20 women. The lateral or posterior position of the presenting part of the fetus was less likely to persist following 10 minutes in the hands and knees position compared to a sitting position (one trial, 100 women, relative risk (RR) 0.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.38). In a second trial (2,547 women), advice to assume the hands and knees posture for 10 minutes twice daily in the last weeks of pregnancy had no effect on the baby's position at delivery.

### Review for the generalist: Evaluation of anterior knee pain [^116DKnC6]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Anterior knee pain is one of the most common musculoskeletal complaints seen in the pediatric population. A fairly extensive differential diagnosis exists, as anterior knee pain is a fairly nonspecific phenomenon. A thorough history and physical examination with attention to the anatomic location of the pain, inciting factors, and relationship of associated symptoms, as well as a general assessment of growth and development, will aid in the evaluation and treatment of this disorder. Awareness of typical injury patterns can aid the physician in narrowing the differential diagnosis. Identification of worrisome signs and symptoms will also help in defining which cases may require further evaluation. All pediatric patients presenting with knee pain require evaluation for ipsilateral hip and lumbar spine disorders. This article reviews common causes of chronic anterior knee pain in the pediatric population, with a focus on patellofemoral pain. It is not meant to be an exhaustive review and will not address acute traumatic knee injuries. Lateral, medial, or posterior knee pain will be covered in a subsequent article.
- **Figure 1**: Patients with anterior knee pain localize the pain to the anterior knee and will point to the entire extensor mechanism, rather than to specific anatomic regions [1].
- **Clinical history**: The clinical history should include a thorough description of the pain characteristics (location, character, onset, duration, change with activity or rest, aggravating and alleviating factors, night pain); trauma (acute macrotrauma, repetitive microtrauma); and other relevant factors.

### Magnetic resonance imaging-defined osteoarthritis features and anterior knee pain in individuals with, or at risk for, knee osteoarthritis: A multicenter study on osteoarthritis [^114Qkpue]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). Low credibility.

One limitation of the present study is that participants in the MOST cohort represent an enriched sample of individuals who have, or are at risk of having, osteoarthritis (OA). Knees without frequent knee pain, our defined comparator, may still have had occasional knee symptoms, including anterior knee pain (AKP), or have had other risk factors for OA. Thus, our study does not include a true control group of asymptomatic, low-risk individuals. While MRI features are prevalent in asymptomatic knees, features have been shown to be more prevalent in knees with chronic patellofemoral pain or OA compared to asymptomatic knees. Additionally, the MRI images read and scored in the parent MOST study were only read in individuals who did not later require knee arthroplasty. This may have resulted in individuals with more severe OA features or worse symptoms being excluded from the analyses. Both of these factors — absence of a true control group and exclusion of individuals who required arthroplasty from MRI readings — may have led to conservative estimates in the present study.

Another limitation is that we defined pain based on its prevalence at a single time point. Pain is subjective and highly variable in severity, pattern of fluctuation, and subjective quality (e.g. dull ache, burning). Our definition of pain may not adequately characterize pain, which may have influenced our results. However, a strength of our study is the use of a pain map to localize pain to the anterior knee region. This contributes to the literature, given that most studies have measured knee pain with less specificity.

### Physical examination and patellofemoral pain syndrome [^1152WNgG]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2006). Low credibility.

Patellofemoral pain syndrome, which accounts for 25% of all sports-related knee injuries, is multifactorial in origin. A combination of variables, including abnormal lower limb biomechanics, soft-tissue tightness, muscle weakness, and excessive exercise, may result in increased cartilage and subchondral bone stress, patellofemoral pain, and subtle or more overt patellar maltracking. Because of the multiple forces affecting the patellofemoral joint, the clinical evaluation and treatment of this disorder are challenging.

An extensive search of the literature revealed no single gold-standard test maneuver for this disorder, and the reliability of the maneuvers described was generally low or untested. An abnormal Q-angle, generalized ligamentous laxity, hypomobile or hypermobile tenderness of the lateral patellar retinaculum, patellar tilt or mediolateral displacement, decreased flexibility of the iliotibial band and quadriceps, and quadriceps, hip abductor, and external rotator weakness were most often correlated with patellofemoral pain syndrome.

### Evaluation of acute knee pain in primary care [^114hznr3]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The evaluation of acute knee pain often includes radiography of the knee.
- **Objective**: To synthesize the literature to determine the role of radiologic procedures in evaluating common causes of acute knee pain: fractures, meniscal or ligamentous injuries, osteoarthritis, and pseudogout.
- **Data sources**: MEDLINE search from 1966 to October 2002.
- **Study selection**: We included all published, peer-reviewed studies of decision rules for fractures. We included studies that used arthroscopy as the gold standard for measuring the accuracy of the physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for meniscal and ligamentous knee damage. We included all studies on the use of radiographs in pseudogout.
- **Data extraction**: We extracted all data in duplicate and abstracted physical examination and MRI results into 2 x 2 tables.
- **Data synthesis**: Among the 5 decision rules for deciding when to use plain films in knee fractures, the Ottawa knee rules (injury due to trauma and age > 55 years, tenderness at the head of the fibula or the patella, inability to bear weight for 4 steps, or inability to flex the knee to 90 degrees) have the strongest supporting evidence. When the history suggests a potential meniscal or ligamentous injury, the physical examination is moderately sensitive (meniscus, 87%; anterior cruciate ligament, 74%; and posterior cruciate ligament, 81%) and specific (meniscus, 92%; anterior cruciate ligament, 95%; and posterior cruciate ligament, 95%). The Lachman test is more sensitive and specific for ligamentous tears than is the drawer sign for meniscal tear.

### Review for the generalist: Evaluation of anterior knee pain [^1128LUof]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2007). Low credibility.

- **Special tests**:
	1. **Patellar tilt test**: Patient is supine with knee extended. Apply downward pressure to the medial edge of the patella to assess lateral patellar restraints. The test is positive if the patellar tilt angle is more than 5 degrees.

	2. **Medial and lateral patellar glide**: Push the patella medially and laterally, noting the degree of movement relative to the width of the patella. Greater than 75% translation indicates hypermobility.

	3. **Quadriceps setting/grind test, patellar inhibition**: Suprapatellar resistance is applied while the patient performs an isometric quadriceps contraction with the knee in full extension. Pain indicates a positive test.

	4. **Patellar compression test**: Direct compression of the patella into the trochlea, with pain indicating articular cartilage degeneration or acute chondral injury.

	5. **Patellar apprehension test**: Apply lateral pressure to the patella at 30° knee flexion. The test is positive if the patient feels instability or pain.

	6. **Lachman test**: Positive for anterior cruciate insufficiency if there is anterior translation of the tibia on the femur with the knee in 30° flexion.

	7. **Posterior drawer test**: Positive for posterior cruciate ligament insufficiency if there is posterior translation of the tibia on the femur with the knee in 90° flexion.

	8. **McMurray's test**: Positive for a meniscal tear if a palpable or audible click is present. The patient is supine with the hip flexed to 90°. Maximally flex the knee followed by passive knee extension, first with external tibial rotation while applying varus stress at the knee (lateral meniscus) and then with internal tibial rotation while applying valgus stress at the knee (medial meniscus).

	9. **Trendelenburg test**: Positive.

### Evaluation and treatment of knee pain: A review [^113jfkda]. JAMA (2023). High credibility.

Approximately 5% of all primary care visits in adults are related to knee pain. Osteoarthritis (OA), patellofemoral pain, and meniscal tears are among the most common causes of knee pain.
- **Observations**: Knee OA affects an estimated 654 million people worldwide. It is the most likely diagnosis of knee pain in patients aged 45 years or older who present with activity-related knee joint pain with no or less than 30 minutes of morning stiffness (95% sensitivity; 69% specificity). Patellofemoral pain typically affects people younger than 40 years who are physically active, with a lifetime prevalence of approximately 25%. The presence of anterior knee pain during a squat is approximately 91% sensitive and 50% specific for patellofemoral pain. Meniscal tears affect an estimated 12% of the adult population and can occur following acute trauma (e.g. twisting injury) in people younger than 40 years, or as a degenerative condition in patients with knee OA who are aged 40 years or older. The McMurray test, consisting of knee rotation (internal or external to test lateral or medial meniscus, respectively) and extension (61% sensitivity; 84% specificity), as well as joint line tenderness (83% sensitivity; 83% specificity), assist in the diagnosis of meniscal tears. Radiographic imaging of all patients with possible knee OA is not recommended. First-line management of OA includes exercise therapy, weight loss (if overweight), education, and self-management programs to empower patients to better manage their condition.

### Assessment of joint space narrowing with conventional standing antero-posterior radiographs: Relief in mild-to-moderate pain is not a confounder in recent osteoarthritis structure-modifying drug trials [^112NipiM]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2006). Low credibility.

Knee pain relief has been suggested to potentially alter radioanatomic positioning in conventional standing antero-posterior knee radiographs. This study was performed to determine whether this is always the case, particularly if it applied to two recent randomized, placebo-controlled trials showing both symptom- and structure-modification with glucosamine sulfate in knee osteoarthritis.
- **Design**: Patients in the two studies were selected if they completed the 3-year evaluations and, irrespective of treatment, (1) were pain-improvers, undergoing a Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) osteoarthritis index pain decrease at least equal to the mean improvement observed with glucosamine sulfate, or (2) if their baseline standing knee pain (item #5 of the WOMAC pain scale) was "severe" or "extreme" and improved by any degree at the end of the trials. Changes in minimum joint space width were then compared between treatments.
- **Results**: Knee pain was of mild-to-moderate severity in the two original studies and in all patient subsets identified here. There were more pain-improvers in the glucosamine sulfate than in the placebo subsets (76 vs. 57 when pooling the two studies), but WOMAC pain scores improved to the same extent (over 50% relative to baseline). Notwithstanding such major pain relief, patients in the placebo subsets of both studies experienced definite mean (SE) joint space narrowing, which was -0.22 (0.15) mm in the pooled analysis. This narrowing was not observed with glucosamine sulfate, which showed +0.15 (0.07) mm; P = 0.003.

### Cyst-like lesions of the knee joint and their relation to incident knee pain and development of radiographic osteoarthritis: the MOST study [^1112oi79]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2010). Low credibility.

The study aims to determine the association of intra- and periarticular cyst-like lesions of the knee with incident knee pain and the development of radiographic knee osteoarthritis (OA).

The Multicenter Osteoarthritis (MOST) Study is a cohort consisting of individuals with or at high risk for knee OA. Utilizing a nested case-control study design, the research investigates the associations of cyst-like lesions, including Baker's, meniscal, and proximal tibiofibular joint (PTFJ) cysts, as well as prepatellar and anserine bursitides, with:

- **Incident pain**: Evaluated at 15- or 30-month follow-up.
- **Incident radiographic OA**: Assessed at 30-month follow-up.

Baseline cyst-like lesions were scored semiquantitatively using the Whole Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score (WORMS). Conditional logistic regression models were employed to assess the relation between these lesions and the outcomes, with adjustments for potential confounding factors such as cartilage loss, meniscal damage, bone marrow lesions, synovitis, and joint effusion, which were also scored using WORMS.

Results indicate:

- **Incident knee pain study**: Included 157 cases and 336 controls. The prevalence of meniscal and PTFJ cysts in the case group was twice that in the control group [9 (6%) vs. 9 (3%) and 9 (6%) vs. 10 (3%), respectively].

- **Incident radiographic OA study**: Comprised 149 cases and 298 controls. The prevalence of grade 2 Baker's cysts and PTFJ cysts in the case group was approximately four times that in the control group [16 (11%) vs. 9 (3%) and 6 (4%) vs. 3 (1%), respectively].

However, after fully adjusting for confounding factors, none of the cyst-like lesions was significantly associated with incident pain or radiographic OA.

### Holistic approach to understanding anterior knee pain. Clinical implications [^114C9aMg]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Anterior knee pain is one of the most frequent reasons for consultation within knee conditions. The aetiology is not well known, which explains the sometimes unpredictable results of its treatment. Normally, when we see a patient in the office with anterior knee pain, we only study and focus on the knee. If we do this, we are making a big mistake. We must not forget to evaluate the pelvis and proximal femur, as well as the psychological factors that modulate the course of the illness.
- **Therapeutic targets**: Both pelvifemoral dysfunction and psychological factors (anxiety, depression, catastrophization, and kinesiophobia) must be included in our therapeutic targets of the multidisciplinary treatment of anterior knee pain. We must not only focus on the knee; we must remember to "look up" to fully understand what is happening and be able to solve this difficult problem.
- **Individualized diagnosis and treatment**: The aetiology of anterior knee pain is multifactorial. Therefore, diagnosis and treatment of patellofemoral disorders must be individualized. Our findings stress the importance of tailoring physiotherapy, surgery, and psycho-educational interventions to each patient.

### Snapping popliteus tendon in a 21-year-old female [^111WYvSN]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2008). High credibility.

Determining the cause of painful snapping on the lateral aspect of the knee can be a challenge. The differential diagnosis includes iliotibial band friction syndrome, lateral meniscus tear, intra-articular loose body, discoid lateral meniscus, snapping biceps femoris tendon, degenerative joint disease, proximal tibiofibular joint instability, and snapping popliteus tendon.

A 21-year-old female presented with a 7-year history of a painful snapping on the lateral aspect of her left knee. She reported the snapping occurred with all activities involving knee flexion and extension, including running and walking. With a diagnosis of snapping iliotibial band, she had received a variety of physical therapy interventions, including various lower extremity stretching and strengthening exercises. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications were also prescribed by her physician. Conservative and pharmacological interventions were unsuccessful in improving her symptoms. Similarly, our attempt with conservative treatment consisting of ice, taping, and a short period of immobilization was not successful.

The patient underwent a surgical procedure consisting of removal of a prominent tubercle on the lateral femoral condyle and tenodesis of the popliteus tendon to the proximal aspect of the fibular (lateral) collateral ligament, followed by a postoperative program of physical therapy, including range-of-motion and progressive strengthening exercises. At six weeks following surgery, the patient had returned to all activities.

### Chronic posterolateral instability of the knee: A new surgical approach [^1172ryKU]. Arthroscopy (2002). Low credibility.

Posterolateral instability of the knee joint is known to be one of the most disabling injuries of the knee. Despite the surgeon's efforts, it often remains unrecognized in the acute phase. Although many techniques have been described to treat it, there are still controversies about the results, and sometimes it is difficult to use them in every case. We present a technique using the semitendinous while preserving the distal insertion to make both passive and active reinforcement of the damaged structures.

### Patellofemoral pain syndrome [^111q166K]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2014). Low credibility.

The patellofemoral pain syndrome is a clinical entity that leads to anterior knee pain in patients without any pathological changes at the cartilage of the patellofemoral joint. Patellar maltracking, due to a functional malalignment or dynamic valgus, may be an underlying cause for this clinical entity. Possible causes for dynamic valgus may include decreased strength of the hip abductors or a pes pronatus valgus. Functional malalignment is associated with quadriceps dysbalance, hamstring tightness, or iliotibial tract tightness. The clinical usefulness of these findings is that a physician may tailor an individual treatment plan for each patient according to the underlying pathology. However, there is a clear need for further research to distinguish between cause and effect.

The literature provides evidence for a multimodal non-operative therapy concept with short-term use of NSAIDs, short-term use of a medially directed tape, and complex exercise programs incorporating the lower extremity, as well as hip and trunk muscles. There is also evidence supporting the use of patellar braces and foot orthosis. Further studies are needed on braces and foot orthosis.

### Ultrasound imaging of the posterior lateral corner of the knee: a pictorial review of anatomy and pathologies [^112kWAdx]. Insights into Imaging (2024). Low credibility.

Posterior lateral knee pain poses a diagnostic challenge whereby the clinical decision heavily relies on patient's symptoms and physical examination. Various specific tests, such as the varus stress test (for integrity of the lateral collateral ligament) and the Noble compression test (for iliotibial band friction syndrome), are utilized in this sense. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the knee offers comprehensive insights into the structures within the posterolateral corner, facilitating the assessment of potential injuries. Variability in certain components of the posterolateral corner is observable on MR imaging with anatomic correlation. However, concerns regarding cost and portability pose significant considerations when utilizing MR imaging for screening posterior lateral corner injuries.

On the other hand, ultrasound imaging has revolutionized the diagnosis of musculoskeletal disorders, including the painful knee, due to its zero radiation and superior resolution. However, the scanning protocol (EURO-MUSCULUS/USPRM. Basic scanning protocols for knee) does not thoroughly investigate the complex fascia, tendon, and ligamentous systems at the posterior lateral knee. Moreover, important but infrequent conditions, such as popliteus myotendinous junction strain, can be missed. Most of the existing articles present normal sonoanatomy without demonstrating the usefulness of ultrasound examination in delineating the relevant pathologies.

In this pictorial essay, aiming to optimize prompt management, we revisit the anatomy of the posterior lateral corner of the knee.

### Iliotibial band syndrome: A common source of knee pain [^116F9mxq]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Iliotibial band syndrome is a common knee injury. The most common symptom is lateral knee pain caused by inflammation of the distal portion of the iliotibial band. This band is a thick band of fascia that crosses the hip joint and extends distally to insert on the patella, tibia, and biceps femoris tendon. In some athletes, repetitive flexion and extension of the knee causes the distal iliotibial band to become irritated and inflamed, resulting in diffuse lateral knee pain. Iliotibial band syndrome can cause significant morbidity and lead to cessation of exercise.

Although iliotibial band syndrome is easily diagnosed clinically, it can be extremely challenging to treat. Treatment requires active patient participation and compliance with activity modification. Most patients respond to conservative treatment involving stretching of the iliotibial band, strengthening of the gluteus medius, and altering training regimens. Corticosteroid injections should be considered if visible swelling or pain with ambulation persists for more than three days after initiating treatment. A small percentage of patients are refractory to conservative treatment and may require surgical release of the iliotibial band.

### Patellofemoral pain [^111VFEXr]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS), the APTA 2019 guidelines recommend diagnosing PFPS based on the following criteria:

- **Retropatellar or peripatellar pain**: Experienced during activities such as squatting, stair climbing, prolonged sitting, or other functional activities that involve loading the patellofemoral joint in a flexed position.

- **Absence of other conditions**: There should be no other conditions present that are likely to cause anterior knee pain, including tibiofemoral pathologies.

### Gaucher disease: An unusual cause of knee pain [^116HbzKR]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Gaucher disease (GD) is a genetic lysosomal disorder leading to the storage of the glycolipid molecule glucocerebroside in macrophages, causing multiorgan dysfunction. Bone marrow involvement may result in painful bone crises and hematologic disturbances.
- **Case report**: We present a case of a 13-year-old adolescent boy with right knee pain. Radiograph and magnetic resonance imaging of the distal femur indicated possible osteomyelitis or a bone tumor. However, histologic examination of bone biopsy material suggested the diagnosis of GD, which was confirmed by the detection of decreased β-glucocerebrosidase activity and identification of the exact gene mutation.
- **Discussion**: Many visceral and bone abnormalities of GD have been described. The diagnosis of GD is based on clinical and laboratory findings and is established by the measurement of β-glucocerebrosidase dysfunction and the study of GBA gene mutations. Treatment is currently based on enzyme replacement and substrate reduction.
- **Conclusion**: This is a rare case of GD presenting initially with knee pain. Because early diagnosis is important for the treatment of this condition, orthopedic surgeons should consider this uncommon cause in the differential diagnosis of joint pain.

### The analgesic effects of proximal, distal, or no sciatic nerve block on posterior knee pain after total knee arthroplasty: a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial [^116x49ND]. Anesthesiology (2014). High credibility.

The analgesic efficacy of the sciatic nerve block (SNB) after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is unclear. Proximal and distal SNB are each reported to provide posterior knee analgesia, whereas others suggest that posterior knee pain is not important after TKA. This prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-arm, placebo-controlled trial examined whether proximal or distal SNB provides superior analgesia in the posterior knee compared with no SNB after TKA.
- **Methods**: Sixty patients undergoing TKA were randomized to single-shot SNB using either the infragluteal (Proximal group) or popliteal (Distal group) technique, or no SNB (Placebo group). All patients received spinal anesthesia and continuous-femoral nerve blockade. A blinded observer assessed posterior and anterior knee pain at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours postoperatively. The primary outcome was moderate-to-severe posterior knee pain at 4 hours postoperatively; secondary outcomes included SNB procedural time, needle passes, and discomfort.
- **Results**: Fifty-three patients were analyzed. The proportion of patients (Proximal:Distal:Placebo) who experienced moderate-to-severe posterior knee pain was 18%:22%:89% (P < 0.00001) at 2 hours, 24%:28%:72% (P < 0.01) at 4 hours, and 12%:17%:78% (P = 0.00003) at 6 hours postoperatively. For the anterior knee, the proportion of patients reporting moderate-to-severe pain was 6%:11%:44% (P = 0.02) at 2 hours, 6%:6%:39% (P = 0.012) at 4 hours, and 12%:6%:44% (P = 0.017) at 6 hours postoperatively. Moderate-to-severe pain did not differ between groups beyond 6 hours. Both proximal and distal SNB reduced rest pain in the postoperative period.

### No difference in anterior knee pain between a fixed and a mobile posterior stabilized total knee arthroplasty after 7.9 years [^114SfVwP]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2014). High credibility.

The presence of anterior knee pain remains one of the major complaints following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Since the introduction of the mobile TKA, many studies have been performed, and only a few show a slight advantage for the mobile version. In our short-term follow-up study, we found less anterior knee pain in the posterior stabilized mobile knees compared to the posterior stabilized fixed knees. The concept of self-alignment and the results from our short-term study led us to hypothesize that the posterior stabilized mobile knee leads to a lower incidence of anterior knee pain compared to the posterior stabilized fixed knee. This study was designed to determine whether this difference remains after 7.9 years in the follow-up. A secondary line of inquiry was to assess whether one was superior to the other regarding pain, function, quality of life, and survival.

This report is a 6–10-year (median 7.9 years) follow-up study involving the remaining 69 patients with cemented three-component TKA for osteoarthritis in a prospective, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial.

In the posterior stabilized group, five of the 40 knees (13%) versus five of the 29 knees in the posterior stabilized mobile group (17%) experienced anterior knee pain. No differences were observed with regard to range of motion (ROM), visual analogue scale (VAS), Oxford 12-item knee questionnaire, SF-36, Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) patella, Kujala, or the American Knee Society Score (AKSS). Patients with anterior knee pain reported more pain and lower levels of the AKSS, HSS patella, and Kujala scores than the patients without anterior knee pain.

### Dutch multidisciplinary guideline on anterior knee pain: Patellofemoral pain and patellar tendinopathy [^117XzNpX]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of patellar tendinopathy (PT) is mainly based on patient history and physical examination. Patients typically report local load-dependent pain at the inferior pole of the patella. Patellofemoral pain (PFP) and osteoarthritis (OA) are common differential diagnoses. The diagnostic accuracy of patient history and physical examination, as well as the additional value of imaging assessments, remains unclear.
- **Evidence review**: Two studies on physical examinations were included, which were graded as very low.
- **Rationale**: Owing to the absence of literature on the diagnostic value of patient history, recommendations are based on a consensus paper and the opinions of the expert panel. When considering additional imaging assessment, diagnostic ultrasound emerges as the most suitable and readily accessible technique.
- **Recommendations**:
	- The following criteria should be used for a correct clinical diagnosis of PT:
		- Load-dependent pain at the inferior pole of the patella.
		- A positive palpation test for pain at the inferior patellar pole.
		- A positive Royal London hospital test.
		- Pain at the inferior patellar pole during the single leg decline squat.
	- Additional imaging assessments should be undertaken as a confirmatory test when uncertainty remains regarding the correct clinical diagnosis of PT or in the absence of clinically relevant changes after 12 weeks of exercise therapy.
	- The patient should be informed of the lack of evidence regarding additional imaging assessments and the possible extra considerations.

### Is a "false-positive" clinical diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis just the early diagnosis of pre-radiographic disease [^111rX63p]. Arthritis Care & Research (2010). Low credibility.

In routine practice, the diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis (OA) currently relies on the combination of conventional risk factors and the presence of cardinal signs and symptoms. However, their role in early diagnosis has received little attention compared with biomarker research.

Using data from 122 adults ages ≥ 50 years with knee pain but no definite radiographic OA, we tested whether the clinical diagnostic probability of OA, based on risk factors, signs, and symptoms, was associated with the subsequent incidence of radiographic OA 3 years later.

Clinical diagnostic probability performed only modestly in discriminating incident radiographic knee OA (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.59, 95% confidence interval 0.49–0.70).

Improving the measurement of conventional markers and using study designs that test the ability of new biomarkers to add to or replace conventional markers are priorities for research in the early diagnosis of OA.

### Hoffa's fat pad abnormalities, knee pain and magnetic resonance imaging in daily practice [^113ewLwX]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Impingement in Hoffa's fat pad (HFP) is a clinical syndrome manifesting mainly as anterior knee pain, which most commonly occurs after repetitive local microtraumas. It is typically located at the superolateral portion of the HFP and occurs secondary to repetitive pinching of the external portion of the fat pad between the lateral patellofemoral ligament and the cartilage of the lateral facet of the trochlea. Any conditions associated with a decrease in the distance between these two structures can facilitate local impingement. A higher position of the patella, known as patella alta, is also associated with HFP impingement.

The impingement typically occurs during full flexion of the knee, where the patient presents with lateral parapatellar pain aggravated by physical activity, which slowly disappears with rest. Joint effusion is rarely detected. The differential diagnosis with chondromalacia of the patellar cartilage is challenging during the physical examination, as the symptoms are nearly identical in both conditions. Proximal patellar tendinopathy (jumper's knee) also presents as anterior knee pain, and local pressure on the proximal tendon reproduces the patient's symptoms. While ultrasound can easily confirm the diagnosis of jumper's knee, this technique is ineffective in diagnosing HFP impingement.

Some studies have reported associations between HFP impingement and superolateral, posterior, or diffuse oedema. HFP oedema characteristically manifests as an area of increased signal intensity on high-contrast MRI images.

### Is patellofemoral osteoarthritis common in middle-aged people with chronic patellofemoral pain [^111iFedJ]. Arthritis Care & Research (2014). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to document the prevalence of radiographic osteoarthritis (OA) in the medial and lateral patellofemoral (PF) joint compartments, relative to the prevalence of tibiofemoral (TF) joint OA in middle-aged and older adults with chronic PF knee pain.

- **Methods**: A convenience sample of 224 people who volunteered for a clinical trial underwent weight-bearing posteroanterior and skyline knee radiographs of their most symptomatic eligible knee. Radiographic severity in the TF joint and in the medial and lateral PF joint compartments was independently graded by two examiners using the Kellgren/Lawrence (K/L) grading system. K/L grades ≥ 2 were considered evidence of OA.

- **Results**: OA was common in this cohort, and the most prevalent pattern was combined TF joint and PF joint OA (n = 98 [44%]), followed by isolated PF joint OA (n = 57 [25%]). Isolated TF joint OA was rare. Overall, more people demonstrated radiographic OA in the PF joint (n = 155 [69%]) than in the TF joint (n = 100 [45%]). The majority of people with PF joint OA had OA in both the medial and lateral PF joint compartments (n = 98 [63%]). Even in people under 50 years, radiographic OA was common, with 26% (n = 21) showing isolated PF joint OA and 29% (n = 23) having combined TF joint and PF joint OA. The severity of PF joint OA was similar across men and women.

- **Conclusion**: PF joint OA was highly prevalent, more so than TF joint OA, even in individuals under 50 years. Further research is needed to elucidate the cause-and-effect relationship between chronic PF pain and PF joint OA.

### Diagnostic accuracy of ultrasonography in the assessment of anterior knee pain [^115QMFBq]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Anterior knee pain (AKP) is a problematic complaint, considered the most frequent cause of orthopedic consultancy for knee problems. The differential diagnosis of AKP encompasses a wide range of possibilities, which still overlap and lack clear understanding. It is more prevalent in young people between 15 and 30 years and occurs more frequently in women than in men. Despite its prevalence, the nature and causes of AKP remain inadequately understood and can be bothersome for patients and clinicians. It causes chronic disability, limits sports and activity, and negatively impacts the quality of life.

Many authors have linked AKP to patellofemoral pathology, especially patellofemoral instability. Others have reported that structural anomalies do not completely explain the pain. Moreover, structural anomalies were found to be minor among AKP patients, and there was no obvious correlation between patellofemoral malalignment and long-term treatment outcomes for AKP.

The patient's clinical history and physical examination are of paramount importance in diagnosing the cause of AKP. The physical examination, when complemented by imaging examinations, should yield a precise diagnosis, which forms the cornerstone for developing an appropriate therapeutic program. Imaging workup is essential to evaluate the extent of bone and soft tissue abnormality and to guide therapeutic intervention if needed. The most helpful diagnostic techniques for evaluating soft tissue changes are ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

### Emerging updates on the posterior cruciate ligament: A review of the current literature [^117XKYHe]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) is recognized as an essential stabilizer of the knee. However, the complexity of the ligament has generated controversy about its definitive role and the recommended treatment after injury. A proper understanding of the functional role of the PCL is necessary to minimize residual instability, osteoarthritic progression, and failure of additional concomitant ligament graft reconstructions or meniscal repairs after treatment. Recent anatomical and biomechanical studies have elucidated the surgically relevant quantitative anatomy and confirmed the codominant role of the anterolateral and posteromedial bundles of the PCL.

Although nonoperative treatment has historically been the initial treatment of choice for isolated PCL injury, possibly biased by the historically poorer objective outcomes postoperatively compared with anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions, surgical intervention has been increasingly used for isolated and combined PCL injuries. Recent studies have more clearly elucidated the biomechanical and clinical effects after PCL tears and resultant treatments. This article presents a thorough review of updates on the clinically relevant anatomy, epidemiology, biomechanical function, diagnosis, and treatments for the PCL, with an emphasis on the emerging clinical and biomechanical evidence regarding each of the treatment choices for PCL reconstruction surgery.

It is recommended that future outcomes studies use PCL stress radiographs to determine objective outcomes and that evidence level 1 and 2 studies be performed.

### Effect of adductor canal block combined with infiltration between the popliteal artery and posterior capsular of the knee on chronic pain after total knee arthroplasty: a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^114yFaBu]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). High credibility.

The pain intensity decreased significantly within 24 hours in the ropivacaine group. However, there was no significant difference in pain scores between the two groups at 2 and 3 days after the operation, likely due to the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of local anesthetics. Cummings et al. reported that even with dexamethasone as an adjuvant, the action time of ropivacaine rarely exceeds 24 hours. Furthermore, at discharge from the PACU, no difference in pain scores was observed between the groups, which may be attributed to the residual effects of analgesics used during surgery.

The nerves innervating the knee are relatively complex. A cadaver study demonstrated that the saphenous nerve and the nerve to the vastus medialis, running in the adductor canal, provide substantial innervation to the anteromedial aspect of the knee, including the joint capsule and the medial patellar retinaculum. Another cadaver study showed that articular branches innervating the posterior knee joint capsule emanate from the posterior division of the obturator nerve, sciatic nerve, main common fibular nerve, and tibial nerve.

- **Adductor canal block (ACB)**: ACB can effectively block the saphenous nerve and the nerve to the vastus medialis, which innervate the anterior part of the knee, and potentially the obturator nerve.

- **Infiltration between the popliteal artery and the posterior capsular of the knee (IPACK)**: Simultaneously, the IPACK targets sensory nerves that innervate the posterior knee compartment.

The combination of ACB and IPACK is widely used in clinical practice and is favored by surgeons and patients. Thus, ACB combined with IPACK was chosen for postoperative analgesia.

### Review for the generalist: Evaluation of anterior knee pain [^115nYyBS]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2007). Low credibility.

- **Bursitis**: There are multiple bursas around the knee. Bursas are synovial lined structures that provide a low-friction interface between tissues to facilitate smooth motion. Bursitis, the inflammation of the bursa, can be secondary to repetitive microtrauma from overuse, direct trauma, autoimmune diseases including juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), or infection. Prepatellar bursitis is the most common, presenting with anterior knee pain and swelling. Infrapatellar bursitis may also cause anterior knee pain, mimicking patellar tendinopathy, but can be diagnosed by careful palpation for localized tenderness. In both conditions, it is important to differentiate fluid in the bursa from intraarticular effusion. Treatment includes local cryotherapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and avoidance of further direct trauma to the bursa. If there are any signs of septic bursitis, the bursa should be aspirated, and appropriate antibiotics prescribed.
- **Inflammatory disorders**: Oligoarticular JIA often presents with monoarticular knee arthritis. Children may present with anterior knee pain, but the typical history of morning stiffness and gradual resolution of pain with activity, along with clinical exam findings, usually allow the practitioner to make the correct diagnosis. A complete joint and systemic examination to exclude other joint involvement is important, as is screening for asymptomatic uveitis associated with JIA.

The JIA subtype, Enthesitis Related Arthritis, is unique in that it is more common in school-age boys.

### Review for the generalist: Evaluation of anterior knee pain [^116W4zw6]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Anterior knee pain can arise from pain receptors located in several knee structures, such as the patella, synovium, fat pad, tendon, subchondral bone, and quadriceps retinaculum. These structures, whether individually or in combination, can lead to anterior knee pain. Typically, this pain involves the patellofemoral joint and the extensor mechanism of the knee. The term "anterior knee pain" is frequently used interchangeably with "patellofemoral pain". However, the term "chondromalacia patella", once synonymously used with anterior knee pain, is now considered outdated. Chondromalacia patella is a surgical finding, not a diagnosis, and patients with anterior knee pain do not necessarily have chondromalacia patella, nor do all with chondromalacia experience pain. Conditions unique to the growing pediatric skeleton, such as hip disease (slipped capital femoral epiphyses and Perthes' disease) or osteochondroses (Osgood-Schlatter disease or Sinding-Larsen-Johansson disease), can cause anterior knee pain. Occasionally, serious underlying systemic diseases, including inflammatory conditions and malignancies, are responsible for anterior knee pain.
- **Patellofemoral pain syndrome**: Patellofemoral pain (PFP) is the most common knee problem encountered by primary care physicians. The term "patellofemoral syndrome" describes non-specific pain in and around the patella.
- **Epidemiology**: PFP affects both active and non-active children, is more prevalent in girls, and is most common during the adolescent growth spurt.

### Diagnostic accuracy of ultrasonography in the assessment of anterior knee pain [^115cKhmg]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Ultrasonography showed high diagnostic accuracy in detecting most causes of anterior knee pain (AKP). Although MRI is the gold standard technique for AKP imaging, ultrasonography can be used for swift screening and assessment of the painful anterior knee. It serves as a viable alternative to MRI, particularly when MRI is unavailable or contraindicated. MRI may be warranted if a patellar cartilage defect is clinically suspected or if ultrasonography yields negative results.

### Posterior cruciate ligament tears in Taiwan: An analysis of 140 surgically treated cases [^1175e39f]. Clinical Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) tears are commonly due to motor vehicle accidents or sports-related trauma but can differ geographically. We report the various causes, types, and associated injuries of PCL tears in Taiwan.
- **Methods**: One hundred forty patients with arthroscopically treated PCL tears were reviewed.
- **Results**: Scooter-related trauma was the most common cause of PCL tear in our series and is typically an isolated ligamentous injury. High-velocity motor vehicle accidents accounted for a small percentage of PCL tears.
- **Conclusion**: Scooter-related PCL tears are common in Taiwanese patients and are often isolated ligamentous injuries, similar to low-velocity sports-related PCL injuries.

### Review for the generalist: Evaluation of anterior knee pain [^116HXMWq]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Anterior knee pain is prevalent among children and adolescents. Its evaluation and management are challenging, requiring a comprehensive history, physical examination, and an understanding of the pediatric skeleton. This article reviews common causes of chronic anterior knee pain in the pediatric population, with a focus on patellofemoral pain.

### Anterior knee pain: Diagnosis and treatment [^115Q4MU8]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2005). Low credibility.

Anterior knee pain is a frequent clinical problem and presents a common challenge to diagnose and manage. Basic science studies have provided insight into the origin of anterior knee pain and enhanced understanding of the anatomy. Clinical evaluation has progressively focused on the contribution of the entire lower extremity to patellofemoral function.

Nonsurgical management has been refined by the concept of the "envelope of function" and by increased understanding of the neuromuscular control of the knee. Indications for lateral release have been clarified and narrowed. Although anteromedial transfer of the tibial tuberosity is helpful in certain circumstances, reports of postoperative fracture have led to less aggressive rehabilitation protocols.

Chondral resurfacing of the patellofemoral joint and patellofemoral arthroplasty are evolving. Emphasis should remain on nonsurgical management, which is sufficient in most patients.

### Which factors differentiate athletes with hip/groin pain from those without? A systematic review with meta-analysis [^1144SsSr]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

This systematic review identified and synthesized data from 17 studies, 10 of which were high quality. The following levels of evidence were found for various factors able to differentiate athletes with and without hip/groin pain:

- **Strong evidence for**: PROs, pain on the adductor squeeze test, hip internal rotation (IR), bent knee fall out, adductor squeeze strength, and altered trunk muscle function.
- **Moderate evidence for**: Pubic bone edema and secondary cleft sign.
- **Limited evidence for**: Pain provocation tests (other than the adductor squeeze), hip external rotation (ER) in 90° flexion, X-ray abnormalities of the pubis, radiological features of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI), and biomarkers of cartilage degradation.

There is strong evidence that hip ER range of motion does not differentiate between these athletes when measured in neutral flexion/extension. PROs, pain, reduced strength on the adductor squeeze test, reduced range of motion in internal rotation, and bent knee fall out are the outcome measures that best differentiate athletes with hip/groin pain from those without pain.

- **What are the new findings?**

- There is strong evidence that the following factors differentiate athletes with hip/groin pain from those without:
	- Patient-reported outcomes
	- Presence of pain on the adductor squeeze test
	- Reduced strength score on adductor squeeze test
	- Reduced range of motion in hip internal rotation and bent knee fall out
	- Altered trunk muscle function.
- There is moderate evidence that the following factors differentiate athletes with hip/groin pain from those without:
	- Presence of pubic bone edema and secondary cleft sign on MRI.

### Retention versus sacrifice of the posterior cruciate ligament in total knee arthroplasty for treating osteoarthritis [^116z4axh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

The functional and clinical basis for deciding whether to retain the posterior cruciate ligament during total knee arthroplasty surgery remained unclear following a Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis in 2005, which included eight clinical trials. Several new trials have been conducted since then. Consequently, an update of the review was performed.
- **Objectives**: Our aim was to assess the benefits and harms of retention compared to the sacrifice of the posterior cruciate ligament in total knee arthroplasty in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee.
- **Search methods**: An extensive search was conducted in CENTRAL, MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL, Academic Search Premier, Contents Connect, and Science Direct. All databases were searched without any limitations, up to 6 December 2012. References of the articles were checked, and citation tracking was performed.
- **Selection criteria**: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing retention with sacrifice of the posterior cruciate ligament in primary total knee arthroplasty in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee.
- **Data collection and analysis**: Data were collected using a pre-developed form. Risk of bias was assessed independently by two authors. The level of evidence was graded using the GRADE approach. Meta-analysis was performed by pooling the results of the selected studies, when possible. Subgroup analyses were performed for posterior cruciate ligament retention versus sacrifice using the same total knee arthroplasty design.

### Hoffa's fat pad abnormalities, knee pain and magnetic resonance imaging in daily practice [^115sfCws]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Meniscal cysts are fluid collections located within or adjacent to the meniscus (Fig. 16) and are caused by fluid extravasation into the parameniscal soft tissue through a meniscal tear. Meniscal tears often have a horizontal component. At MRI, meniscal cysts are frequently septate, exhibit a fluid signal, and are located close to a grade-3 meniscal lesion. Lobulated cysts adjacent to a normal meniscus are generally not meniscal cysts but ganglions. Hoffa's fat pad (HFP) oedema, sometimes adjacent to a meniscal cyst, is probably secondary to leakage of fluid through the cyst's wall. Initially, non-surgical treatment of meniscal cysts is preferable. Ultrasound-guided local steroid-lidocaine injections can reduce local inflammation and alleviate patient pain. In non-responding patients, surgical excision is indicated, and meniscectomy may be necessary to prevent recurrence.
- **Synovial pathology**: Synovial pathologies, such as pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) (Fig. 17), synovial osteochondromatosis (Fig. 18), synovial hemangioma, and joint effusion, can be associated with focal or diffuse oedema of the HFP. PVNS is a rare, articular, diffuse or peri-articular focal, benign, synovial tissue proliferation. Detection of a diffuse hypertrophy of the synovial membrane at the anterior knee or of a focal and well-circumscribed nodule, which shows a hypointense signal in all MRI sequences (Fig. 17), is highly suggestive of PVNS. The low signal intensity in the T2w images is due to the paramagnetic effect of hemosiderin contained inside the PVNS lesion.

### Epidemiology of surgically treated posterior cruciate ligament injuries in Scandinavia [^114eiXbv]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2017). Low credibility.

The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) is the stronger of the two cruciate ligaments in the knee, accounting for about 95% of the total restraint to posterior translation of the tibia in relation to the femur. In addition, the PCL has secondary stabilizing functions; it restrains rotation when the knee is flexed and maintains varus and valgus stability when the knee is extended.

The reported incidence of PCL injuries shows significant variation, being responsible for 1–44% of all acute knee injuries. This variability might be due to some authors focusing on trauma settings and others on athletic populations. There is also variation in the reported rate of isolated PCL injuries. Schulz et al. reported that 47% of cases had isolated injuries, while 53% had concomitant injuries, based on the degree of posterior displacement (5–12 mm was classified as an isolated injury). Conversely, Fanelli et al. reported that the incidence of isolated injuries was 7.5%, with 92.5% being concomitant injuries (evaluated by arthroscopy).

There is also some discrepancy regarding cartilage and meniscal lesions. Two previous studies described observed cartilage lesions in about 30% of isolated PCL injuries. However, a recent study reported the incidence of ICRS grade 3–4 cartilage injuries as 9.9%. Geissler and Whipple reported that out of 33 patients assumed to have an isolated PCL injury, 12% also had cartilage defects, and 27% had meniscal tears.

### Review for the generalist: Evaluation of anterior knee pain [^115db8Rn]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2007).

- **Patellofemoral instability and patellar subluxation**: Patellofemoral dysplasia, whether congenital or acquired, represents a spectrum of disorders characterized by the static and dynamic malalignment of the patella relative to the distal femur. This malalignment results in maltracking of the patella, leading to instability and potential osteochondral injury. Four clinical subtypes are recognized based on the degree of malalignment: mild dynamic imbalance of the patella with excessive loading of the lateral patellar and femoral facets (lateral patellar compression syndrome), chronic subluxing patella, recurrent patellar dislocation, and chronic (or obligatory) dislocation of the patella. Patients with patellofemoral instability may complain of anterior knee pain, episodic giving way, and locking and catching sensations associated with re-effusions. On examination, findings are similar to patellofemoral pain. Patella alta, tenderness over the medial patellofemoral ligament, a positive patellar apprehension test, or frank lateral dislocation may be elicited. Treatment includes stretching tight lateral structures (vastus lateralis, iliotibial band), strengthening medial structures (VMO), using knee orthoses for patellar stabilization, and foot orthoses to correct excessive subtalar pronation. Orthopedic referral and possible surgical management are recommended for recurrent and chronic obligatory patellar dislocation.
- **Patellar tendinopathy**: "Jumper's knee" or patellar tendinopathy is a common cause of infrapatellar pain. Pain is usually maximal at the patellar attachment and proximal tendon and is aggravated.

### Different patient and activity-related characteristics result in different injury profiles for patients with anterior cruciate ligament and posterior cruciate ligament injuries [^111zdDCU]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). High credibility.

Injuries to the cruciate ligaments, including anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) tears, are severe injuries affecting athletes in their ability to return to sport. Previous studies have demonstrated a higher incidence of PCL injuries in men, while female athletes appear to run a greater risk of sustaining an ACL injury. Furthermore, ACL injuries are reported to occur more commonly in young high-level female athletes, while males affected by an ACL injury are reported to be somewhat older. A higher body mass index (BMI) has also been related to an increased risk of sustaining cruciate ligament injuries and has been reported to be an important contributory factor in combined knee ligament injuries. Additionally, different injury profiles of knee ligament injuries have been linked to different types of injury mechanisms, where ACL injuries have usually been associated with non-contact sports and PCL injuries with high-energy trauma. Consequently, PCL injuries more frequently coincide with additional knee ligament tears, while ACL injuries more often occur with meniscal lesions.

Despite the rising incidence of cruciate ligament injuries and their negative impact on both sports participation and general knee function, the specific injury profiles for ACL and PCL injuries are yet to be described. The purpose of this study was to explore and compare patient characteristics including patient sex, age, BMI, and activity at the time of injury, as well as injury profiles in patients undergoing either ACL or PCL reconstruction.

### Associations between anterior knee pain and 2-year patellofemoral cartilage worsening: The MOST study [^111QvVeQ]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2024). Low credibility.

Anterior knee pain (AKP) is associated with patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA), but longitudinal studies are lacking. If AKP precedes PFOA, it may create an opportunity to identify and intervene earlier in the disease process. The purpose of this study was to examine the longitudinal relation of AKP to worsening patellofemoral (PF) cartilage over two years.

Participants were recruited from the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study, a longitudinal study of individuals with or at risk for knee osteoarthritis (OA). Exclusion criteria included bilateral knee replacements, arthritis other than OA, and radiographic PFOA. At baseline, participants completed a knee pain map questionnaire and underwent knee magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Imaging was repeated at 2-year follow-up. Exposure was the presence of frequent AKP. The outcome was worsening cartilage damage in the PF joint, defined as an increase in MRI Osteoarthritis Knee Score from baseline to 2 years. Log-binomial models were used to calculate risk ratios (RR).

One knee from 1,083 participants (age 56.7 ± 6.6 years; body mass index 28.0 ± 4.9 kg/m²) was included. Frequent AKP and frequent isolated AKP were present at baseline in 14.5% and 3.6%, respectively. Frequent AKP was associated with an increased risk (RR: 1.78, 95% confidence interval: 1.21, 2.62) of 2-year worsening cartilage damage in the lateral PF compartment. No association was found between frequent AKP and worsening in the medial PF joint.

Frequent AKP at baseline was associated with worsening cartilage damage in the lateral PF.

### Knee pain in adults and adolescents: The initial evaluation [^1173sAtq]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Knee pain affects approximately 25% of adults, and its prevalence has increased almost 65% over the past 20 years, accounting for nearly 4 million primary care visits annually. Initial evaluation should emphasize excluding urgent causes while considering the need for referral. Key aspects of the patient history include age; location, onset, duration, and quality of pain; associated mechanical or systemic symptoms; history of swelling; description of precipitating trauma; and pertinent medical or surgical history.

Patients requiring urgent referral generally have severe pain, swelling, and instability or inability to bear weight in association with acute trauma or show signs of joint infection such as fever, swelling, erythema, and limited range of motion. A systematic approach to the examination of the knee includes inspection, palpation, evaluation of range of motion and strength, neurovascular testing, and special (provocative) tests. Radiographic imaging should be reserved for chronic knee pain (more than six weeks) or acute traumatic pain in patients who meet specific evidence-based criteria.

Musculoskeletal ultrasonography allows for a detailed evaluation of effusions, cysts (e.g. Baker cyst), and superficial structures. Magnetic resonance imaging is rarely used for patients with emergent cases and should generally be an option only when surgery is considered or when a patient experiences persistent pain despite adequate conservative treatment. When the initial history and physical examination suggest but do not confirm a specific diagnosis, laboratory tests can be used as needed.
