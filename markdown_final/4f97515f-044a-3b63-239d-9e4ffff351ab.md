## Question

patient with fever and green nasal discharge despite intranasal corticosteroids and saline

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate and manage an adult with fever and green nasal discharge who is already using intranasal corticosteroids and saline irrigation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical syndrome and whether this fits acute rhinosinusitis. Then, I should verify the diagnostic criteria that distinguish viral from bacterial disease and confirm whether fever plus purulent discharge alone establishes ABRS. Next, I will assess severity and complications. After that, I need to check the role and limitations of intranasal corticosteroids and saline in acute disease. Finally, I will decide on antibiotic indications, first-line choices, and follow-up, and I will consider red flags and when to image or refer.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome. Fever with green nasal discharge in the context of nasal obstruction and facial pain or pressure fits acute rhinosinusitis, but I need to ensure we are not overcalling bacterial disease just because the mucus is green, since purulence alone does not distinguish viral from bacterial etiologies and green discharge can occur in viral URIs as well [^90d801cf] [^85e7b29f].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic criteria for ABRS. I initially thought fever plus purulent discharge for 3–4 days might suffice, but hold on, I should verify the exact thresholds. The IDSA and contemporary guidelines define ABRS when symptoms persist ≥ 10 days without improvement, worsen after initial improvement ("double sickening"), or are severe at onset with fever ≥ 39°C (102°F) plus purulent discharge and facial pain for at least 3–4 consecutive days; so fever plus green discharge alone is insufficient unless the fever is high and accompanied by facial pain for several days, and even then, I should confirm duration and trajectory before labeling ABRS [^07b2c00b] [^1c9682af] [^e58e7a35].

> I need to check severity and complications next. I should confirm the fever height, unilateral facial pain, periorbital edema, proptosis, diplopia, forehead swelling, altered mental status, or focal neurologic deficits, because these findings raise concern for severe disease or complications and would lower my threshold for antibiotics and imaging. If any red flags are present, I should not delay escalation and referral [^65d2b5d4] [^1d7920a8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment failure just because symptoms persist on INCS and saline. I should review the evidence base. Intranasal corticosteroids offer only a modest benefit in acute rhinosinusitis and may be less effective in the presence of thick secretions, with meta-analytic data showing a small improvement in symptom resolution or improvement at 14–21 days and better effects with higher doses and longer courses; saline irrigation is low risk and may help symptoms, but evidence quality is limited and heterogeneous, so lack of dramatic improvement on these therapies does not by itself prove bacterial disease or treatment failure [^0e917a22] [^727978fa] [^aaef1391].

> Let me consider the timing of illness, because that drives management. If symptoms are ≤ 10 days and not worsening, viral rhinosinusitis is most likely and antibiotics are not indicated; supportive care with analgesics, hydration, and continued saline with or without INCS is reasonable. If symptoms are ≥ 10 days without improvement, or there is double sickening, or there is severe onset with high fever plus purulent discharge and facial pain for 3–4 days, then ABRS is presumed and antibiotics are indicated. I should double-check that I am applying these thresholds correctly before prescribing [^1c9682af] [^07b2c00b] [^e58e7a35].

> I will now examine antibiotic selection. For uncomplicated adult ABRS without beta-lactam allergy, first-line therapy is amoxicillin or amoxicillin–clavulanate; in regions with high endemic penicillin-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, severe infection, recent antibiotics, older age, daycare exposure, or immunocompromise, high-dose amoxicillin–clavulanate is recommended. For beta-lactam allergy, doxycycline is a reasonable alternative; macrolides are not recommended due to resistance, and fluoroquinolones should be reserved for special circumstances given risks. I should confirm local resistance patterns and patient-specific factors before choosing [^68047c96] [^1d7920a8].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on INCS and saline and not improving? I should confirm adherence and technique, because poor spray delivery or inconsistent irrigation can blunt benefit. If adherence is adequate and the clinical picture still meets ABRS criteria, I should proceed with antibiotics rather than escalating steroid dose or switching brands, as there is no evidence that changing INCS formulation improves outcomes in acute disease. If ABRS criteria are not met, I should avoid antibiotics and continue supportive care with close follow-up [^aaef1391] [^1c9682af].

> Next, I should review follow-up and safety netting. I need to ensure reassessment within 48–72 hours if there is no improvement or if symptoms worsen, at which point I should reconsider the diagnosis, evaluate for complications, and consider culture-directed therapy or imaging. Routine CT is not indicated for uncomplicated ARS, but noncontrast sinus CT is appropriate if complications are suspected or if disease is refractory despite appropriate therapy. I should also counsel on red flags that warrant urgent care [^1d7920a8] [^110be775].

> Let me reconsider the key differentiator one more time to avoid misclassification. Purulent nasal discharge alone, even if green, does not establish ABRS; I must anchor the diagnosis to duration, trajectory, and severity. This helps prevent unnecessary antibiotics and aligns with guideline-based stewardship while ensuring timely treatment for those who truly have bacterial disease [^90d801cf] [^1c9682af].

This patient's fever with green nasal discharge despite intranasal corticosteroids and saline irrigation suggests **acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS)** [^07b2c00b] if symptoms persist ≥ 10 days, worsen after initial improvement, or are severe (≥ 39°C with purulent discharge) for ≥ 3 days [^1c9682af]. Intranasal corticosteroids and saline provide only modest symptom relief and do not treat bacterial infection [^0e917a22] [^727978fa]. If ABRS is confirmed, **initiate antibiotics** (amoxicillin-clavulanate or doxycycline) [^68047c96] and continue supportive care [^aaef1391]; if symptoms persist or complications arise, obtain CT imaging and refer to ENT [^1d7920a8].

---

## Clinical significance of fever and green nasal discharge

Fever with green nasal discharge is common in ABRS, but **green discharge alone is not specific** for bacterial infection [^108b507f] and can occur in viral rhinosinusitis [^85e7b29f]. The combination of fever and purulent discharge increases the likelihood of ABRS, especially when symptoms persist ≥ 10 days, worsen after initial improvement, or are severe at onset [^07b2c00b].

---

## Role of intranasal corticosteroids and saline irrigation

Intranasal corticosteroids and saline irrigation are **adjunctive therapies** for symptomatic relief in acute rhinosinusitis [^aaef1391] [^623c777f]. They reduce inflammation, improve nasal airflow, and lessen mucosal edema, but they do not eradicate bacterial infection [^0e917a22]. Their limited efficacy explains persistent symptoms despite adherence.

---

## Indications for antibiotic therapy

Antibiotics are indicated for ABRS when any of the following criteria are met:

- **Persistent symptoms**: ≥ 10 days without improvement [^07b2c00b].
- **Worsening symptoms**: New fever, headache, or increased nasal discharge after initial improvement [^07b2c00b].
- **Severe onset**: Fever ≥ 39°C (102.2°F) with purulent nasal discharge for ≥ 3 consecutive days [^07b2c00b].

Given persistent fever and green discharge despite intranasal corticosteroids and saline, **ABRS is likely**, and antibiotic therapy is indicated [^e58e7a35].

---

## Recommended antibiotic regimens

First-line antibiotic therapy for ABRS includes:

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage and duration** | **Indications** |
|-|-|-|
| Amoxicillin-clavulanate | 875/125 mg PO BID for 5–7 days | - First-line therapy <br/> - No beta-lactam allergy |
| Doxycycline | 100 mg PO BID for 5–7 days | - Beta-lactam allergy <br/> - Or intolerance |
| Levofloxacin | 500 mg PO daily for 5–7 days | - Severe beta-lactam allergy <br/> - Or intolerance |

---

High-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate (2 g PO BID) is recommended for patients with **severe infection**, recent antibiotic use, or high risk of resistant organisms [^68047c96].

---

## Clinical response and follow-up

Patients should experience **clinical improvement within 48–72 hours** of initiating antibiotics. If there is no improvement or symptoms worsen, reassess the diagnosis, consider antibiotic resistance, or evaluate for complications. Persistent symptoms despite appropriate therapy may necessitate sinus imaging (CT scan) and ENT referral [^1d7920a8].

---

## Potential complications of untreated or refractory sinusitis

Untreated or refractory ABRS can lead to **significant complications**, including:

- **Orbital complications**: Orbital cellulitis, abscess, or cavernous sinus thrombosis [^1d7920a8].
- **Intracranial complications**: Meningitis, brain abscess, or epidural abscess [^1d7920a8].
- **Bone involvement**: Osteomyelitis of the frontal bone [^1d7920a8].

Early recognition and appropriate management are essential to prevent these complications [^65d2b5d4].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Persistent fever with green nasal discharge despite intranasal corticosteroids and saline irrigation suggests ABRS. Intranasal corticosteroids and saline provide symptomatic relief but **do not treat bacterial infection** [^0e917a22]. If ABRS criteria are met, initiate antibiotic therapy (amoxicillin-clavulanate or doxycycline) and continue supportive care [^e58e7a35]. Reassess within 48–72 hours; if there is no improvement, consider imaging and ENT referral [^1d7920a8].

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^d9113695]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis — research needs — identify priorities including to refine and validate diagnostic criteria for VRS and ABRS; determine the validity of diagnosing ABRS by patient history without confirmatory physical examination; assess the validity of diagnosing ABRS before 10 days based on persistent fever plus concurrent purulent nasal discharge; standardize the definition of "severe" illness in ABRS and determine whether it is a valid and useful distinction for diagnosis in adults; evaluate the role of analgesic therapy in managing rhinosinusitis and the comparative efficacy of different drug classes; assess the benefits of symptomatic therapy for VRS in properly conducted randomized controlled trials (RCTs); assess the benefits of various symptomatic therapies for ABRS in properly conducted RCTs; confirm optimum salinity, pH, and regimen for administering nasal saline irrigation; assess the impact of clinician beliefs about antibiotic prescribing for ABRS and how they might affect patient preferences and satisfaction; conduct RCTs with superiority design that emphasize time to improvement/resolution, not just binary outcomes at fixed time points; perform RCTs of antibiotics versus placebo using strict diagnostic criteria and stratify by clinical severity (ie, mild, moderate, or severe); perform RCTs to assess the comparative efficacy of different antibiotics for initial management of uncomplicated ABRS; conduct RCTs to determine the efficacy of adjuvant therapy (nasal steroids, antihistamines, decongestants) in combination with antibiotics; obtain greater evidence for which ABRS patients are most appropriate for short-course antibiotic regimens; perform RCTs examining antibiotic efficacy among various patient subpopulations; include quality-of-life and other patient-reported outcome measures as study outcomes in RCTs; and further assess the diagnosis of CRS and RARS in primary care settings, rather than specialty clinic settings, because of biased disease prevalence.

### Sinusitis (acute) [^6757e8cb]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute sinusitis is defined pathologically, by transient inflammation of the mucosal lining of the paranasal sinuses lasting less than 4 weeks. Clinically, it is characterised by nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, facial pain, hyposmia, sneezing, and, if more severe, additional malaise and fever. It affects 1% to 5% of the adult population each year in Europe.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments in people with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis, and in people with radiologically or bacteriologically confirmed acute sinusitis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2011 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 19 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics (amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid [co-amoxiclav], doxycycline, cephalosporins, macrolides; different doses, long-course regimens), antihistamines, decongestants (xylometazoline, phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine), saline nasal washes, steam inhalation, and topical corticosteroids (intranasal).

### Sinusitis and fever of unknown origin [^eef56658]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

It is relatively uncommon to document sinusitis as a cause of fever with much certainty. Therefore, investigation for sinusitis should be undertaken only after more likely causes have been excluded. and the actions taken should reflect the individual patient's circumstances. Aggressive evaluation and treatment should be geared to minimizing the patient's overall morbidity and to identifying the more aggressive forms of sinusitis and their potential complications.

### Acute rhinosinusitis: rapid evidence review [^1d7920a8]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis causes more than 30 million patients to seek health care per year in the United States. Respiratory tract infections, including bronchitis and sinusitis, account for 75% of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions in primary care. Sinusitis is a clinical diagnosis; the challenge lies in distinguishing between the symptoms of bacterial and viral sinusitis. Cardinal features of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis are unilateral facial pain or pressure, fever greater than 102°F (39°C), and purulent nasal discharge with obstruction of the nasal passages. Antibiotics should be considered for patients with 3 or more days of severe symptoms, significant worsening after 3 to 5 days of symptoms, or 7 or more days of symptoms. Diagnostic testing for acute rhinosinusitis with antral puncture is impractical because of its invasiveness. Point-of-care testing for elevated C-reactive protein may be helpful, but it is not widely available. Studies have shown that amoxicillin is as effective as amoxicillin-clavulanate as a first-line treatment for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis for those without a beta-lactam allergy. For patients with a beta-lactam allergy, appropriate antibiotics include doxycycline or a respiratory fluoroquinolone; clindamycin plus a third-generation cephalosporin is an option for children with non-type I hypersensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics. Supportive care for rhinosinusitis, including use of saline irrigation, nasal steroids or antihistamines, and decongestants, may help reduce the severity of symptoms. Most episodes of rhinosinusitis are self-limited, lasting 7 to 10 days. Complications of rhinosinusitis are rare but may include orbital cellulitis, meningitis, and abscess. Computed tomography and referral to an otolaryngologist should be considered for patients with recurrent rhinosinusitis or concern about complications.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, IDSA 2012 guidelines recommend to diagnose ABRS in patients with:

- symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis that persist for ≥ 10 days, without any evidence of improvement

- symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis that worsen, after initial improvement of symptoms of a typical viral upper respiratory infection that lasted 5–6 days, with new onset of fever, headache, or increase in nasal discharge

- severe symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis, with high fever (≥ 39 °C or ≥ 102 °F) and purulent nasal discharge or facial pain, lasting for at least 3–4 consecutive days at the beginning of illness.

### Acute rhinosinusitis in adults [^10bb4109]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Rhinosinusitis is one of the most common conditions for which patients seek medical care. Subtypes of rhinosinusitis include acute, subacute, recurrent acute, and chronic. Acute rhinosinusitis is further specified as bacterial or viral. Most cases of acute rhinosinusitis are caused by viral infections associated with the common cold. Symptomatic treatment with analgesics, decongestants, and saline nasal irrigation is appropriate in patients who present with nonsevere symptoms (e.g., mild pain, temperature less than 101°F [38.3°C]). Narrow-spectrum antibiotics, such as amoxicillin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, are recommended in patients with symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis that do not improve after seven days, or that worsen at any time. Limited evidence supports the use of intranasal corticosteroids in patients with acute rhinosinusitis. Radiographic imaging is not recommended in the evaluation of uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis. Computed tomography of the sinuses should not be used for routine evaluation, although it may be used to define anatomic abnormalities and evaluate patients with suspected complications of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. Rare complications of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis include orbital, intracranial, and bony involvement. If symptoms persist or progress after maximal medical therapy, and if computed tomography shows evidence of sinus disease, referral to an otolaryngologist is warranted.

Acute bacterial sinusitis — key action statement 1 in children with an acute upper respiratory infection (URI): Clinicians should make a presumptive diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis when a child with an acute URI presents with the following: persistent illness with nasal discharge (of any quality) or daytime cough or both lasting more than 10 days without improvement; OR a worsening course with worsening or new onset of nasal discharge, daytime cough, or fever after initial improvement; OR severe onset with concurrent fever (temperature ≥ 39°C/102.2°F) and purulent nasal discharge for at least 3 consecutive days. The statement is rated Evidence Quality: B; Recommendation, with Aggregate evidence quality: B, Strength Recommendation, and Exclusions of Children aged < 1 year or older than 18 years and with underlying conditions.

### High-dose vs standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate for adults with acute sinusitis: a randomized clinical trial [^8695a992]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

How can clinicians help their patients with presumed acute bacterial sinusitis as defined by the current IDSA guidelines? This randomized clinical trial found that adding more amoxicillin to the standard, but minimally beneficial, treatment with amoxicillin and clavulanate does not appear to be the answer. Quinolones have shown some efficacybut are not without risks, including black box warnings. The best policy may be, therefore, to emphasize the use, also in accordance with IDSA guidelines, of saline flushes and nasal steroids.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^26f7f2b5]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Statement 11: Topical intranasal therapy for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) — Clinicians should recommend saline nasal irrigation, topical intranasal corticosteroids, or both for symptom relief of CRS. Recommendation based on a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade A from systematic reviews of RCTs, and the level of confidence in evidence is High. Benefit includes symptomatic relief, promoting awareness of effective over-the-counter interventions, discouraging improper and ineffective usage, and avoiding adverse events from systemic therapies. Risks, harms, and costs include intranasal discomfort, burning, stinging; epistaxis; and direct costs of saline or steroid; the benefits-harm assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm. The choice of saline, steroid, or both is a shared decision, and there is a large role for patient preferences in deciding which products to use and their duration; the policy level is Recommendation.

### A pragmatic approach towards sinonasal diseases [^c528caf8]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Sinonasal disease in its multiple forms affects billions of people worldwide. Although physicians train to precisely diagnose a patient and then treat appropriately, the sheer number of people afflicted with sinonasal disease precludes this approach. We argue that patients should first be treated with an intranasal corticosteroid for 2 weeks. Based on their perceived response, they should be triaged. Those who respond well can be instructed on how to continue to manage their disease. Those who do not would be referred to allergists or otolaryngologists for diagnosis and treatment. We believe this pragmatic approach is safe, provided first-line physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners recognize some warning symptoms and signs of serious, but infrequently occurring, sinonasal diseases that would not lend themselves to this proposed approach.

### Current concepts in adult acute rhinosinusitis [^9ff8dfe9]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis is one of the most common conditions that physicians treat in ambulatory care. Most cases of acute rhinosinusitis are caused by viral upper respiratory infections. A meta-analysis based on individual patient data found that common clinical signs and symptoms were not effective for identifying patients with rhinosinusitis who would benefit from antibiotics. C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are somewhat useful tests for confirming acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis. Four signs and symptoms that significantly increase the likelihood of a bacterial cause when present are double sickening, purulent rhinorrhea, erythrocyte sedimentation rate greater than 10 mm per hour, and purulent secretion in the nasal cavity. Although cutoffs vary depending on the guideline, antibiotic therapy should be considered when rhinosinusitis symptoms fail to improve within seven to 10 days or if they worsen at any time. First-line antibiotics include amoxicillin with or without clavulanate. Current guidelines support watchful waiting within the first seven to 10 days after upper respiratory symptoms first appear. Evidence on the use of analgesics, intranasal corticosteroids, and saline nasal irrigation for the treatment of acute rhinosinusitis is poor. Nonetheless, these therapies may be used to treat symptoms within the first 10 days of upper respiratory infection. Radiography is not recommended in the evaluation of uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis. For patients who do not respond to treatment, computed tomography of the sinuses without contrast media is helpful to evaluate for possible complications or anatomic abnormalities. Referral to an otolaryngologist is indicated when symptoms persist after maximal medical therapy and if any rare complications are suspected.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^e9da02ca]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis guideline — viral rhinosinusitis (VRS) supportive care and natural history note that acute VRS is estimated to occur from 2 to 5 times per year in the average adult, secondary bacterial infection is believed to complicate only 0.5% to 2.0% of these events, and symptoms typically peak within 3 days then decline and resolve within 10 to 14 days. Management is symptomatic: antibiotics are not recommended for treating VRS as antibiotics are ineffective for viral illness and do not provide direct symptom relief, and palliative medications — non-narcotic analgesics (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, acetaminophen), nasal saline, decongestants, antihistamines, mucolytics, cough suppressants, and topical or oral corticosteroids — may be used alone or in varying combinations for symptom relief. Acetaminophen may help relieve nasal obstruction and rhinorrhea but does not alleviate other viral symptoms, whereas nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents do not improve nasal discharge but improve malaise, sneezing, headache, and otalgia, and should be used with caution in older adults. Nasal saline may be palliative and cleansing with low risk of adverse reactions, with minor improvements in nasal symptom scores reported and a meta-analysis indicating that higher volume irrigations may be superior. For decongestants, in 2023 the FDA advisory committee discouraged the use of oral phenylephrine as a nasal decongestant; use of up to 3 to 5 days of topical oxymetazoline may be beneficial but clinicians should warn patients against paradoxical rebound congestion with use greater than 3 days; pseudoephedrine could be considered beyond this, although recent evidence is lacking and the patient should be counseled regarding contraindications of elevated blood pressure and heart rate. Commonly used antihistamines show no clinically significant effect on nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea or sneezing, and first-generation varieties should be avoided in older adults. While not supported by a large body of evidence, topical corticosteroids in VRS is an option for symptomatic relief, with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 13 and greater effect with longer courses and higher doses. Diagnostic caveats include that nasal purulence alone does not indicate a bacterial infection.

Regarding medical management for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, initiation, AAFP 2025 guidelines recommend to reserve antibiotics for patients with rhinosinusitis presenting with fever, facial pain, and purulent nasal drainage persisting for 7–10 days, exhibiting improvement followed by worsening of symptoms (double-sickening), or experiencing severe symptoms lasting ≥ 3 days.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^aaef1391]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Statement 3: Symptomatic relief of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) — clinicians may recommend analgesics, topical intranasal steroids, and/or nasal saline irrigation for symptomatic relief of ABRS. This is an option based on randomized controlled trials with heterogeneous populations, diagnostic criteria, and outcome measures with a balance of benefit and harm. The action profile urges promotion of analgesics, saline irrigation, and topical intranasal steroids and discourages interventions with questionable, unknown or unproven efficacy such as systemic steroids, decongestants, antihistamines, and guaifenesin. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade A for topical nasal steroids, Grade B for saline irrigation and systemic steroids, and grade D for analgesics, decongestants, antihistamines (in non-atopic patients) and guaifenesin. Benefits include relief of facial pain with analgesics, a modest increase in symptom relief from topical nasal steroids (number needed to treat 11), and possible symptom relief from saline irrigations; risks include local and systemic adverse reactions and medication costs. Level of confidence in evidence is Medium.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) — the algorithm confirms Signs & Symptoms of CRS and requires Documented Sinonasal Inflammation; if not consistent, consider Possible Other Diagnosis (allergies, migraine, etc.). For confirmed CRS, steps include Confirmed the Presence OR Absence of Nasal Polyps, Educate About the Role of Biologics but Do Not Prescribe Biologics, Assess Patient for Chronic Conditions That Would Modify Management, consider the Option of Testing for Allergy & Immune Function, Recommend Saline Nasal Irrigation &/OR Topical Intranasal Corticosteroids, Do Not Prescribe Topical or Systemic Antifungal Therapy, and Do Not Prescribe Antibiotics Empirically Solely as a Prerequisite for Imaging or Surgery, proceeding to Medical or Surgical Management as Appropriate.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^ab42506b]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) specificity and severe presentation — the guideline update group considered the criteria in Table 4 best for distinguishing presumed bacterial versus viral ARS; the specificity for ABRS increases when paired with concurrent purulent nasal discharge, and absence of purulent nasal discharge excludes the diagnosis by definition. A special circumstance of ABRS was defined when purulent nasal discharge for 3 to 4 days was accompanied by high fever.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^29c44215]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Clinical diagnosis — history of rhinosinusitis identifies that acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) is suspected in patients whose upper respiratory infection (URI) has persisted beyond 7 to 10 days or is worsening after initial improvement, and symptoms lasting 5 to 10 days are the most difficult to assess because they may reflect an ongoing viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) or the beginning of a bacterial infection. In adults, prominent symptoms include nasal congestion, obstruction, anterior and/or posterior purulent rhinorrhea, and facial pain or pressure, and a history of persistent purulent rhinorrhea and facial pain appear to have some correlation with increased likelihood of bacterial disease; in children, symptoms often also include increased irritability, even more prolonged cough, and vomiting that occurs in association with gagging on mucus. In contrast to ABRS, chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) cannot be diagnosed by symptoms alone and can be subdivided into CRSsNP and CRSwNP; patients with CRSwNP generally present with periodic exacerbations with increased facial pain or pressure and increased drainage, and fever is absent or low grade with persistence of some sinonasal symptoms between episodes that distinguishes CRS from recurrent acute rhinosinusitis (RARS), in which the patient is asymptomatic between ABRS episodes.

### Saline nasal irrigation for acute upper respiratory tract infections [^727978fa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), including the common cold and rhinosinusitis, are common afflictions that cause discomfort and debilitation and contribute significantly to workplace absenteeism. Treatment is generally by antipyretic and decongestant drugs and sometimes antibiotics, even though most infections are viral. Nasal irrigation with saline is often employed as an adjunct treatment for URTI symptoms despite a relative lack of evidence for benefit in this clinical setting. This review is an update of the Cochrane review by Kassel et al, which found that saline was probably effective in reducing the severity of some symptoms associated with acute URTIs.

Objectives

To assess the effects of saline nasal irrigation for treating the symptoms of acute URTIs.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1966 to July week 5, 2014), EMBASE (1974 to August 2014), CINAHL (1982 to August 2014), AMED (1985 to August 2014) and LILACS (1982 to August 2014).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing topical nasal saline treatment to other interventions in adults and children with clinically diagnosed acute URTIs.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (DK, BM) independently assessed trial quality with the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool and extracted data. We analysed all data using the Cochrane Review Manager software. Due to the large variability of outcome measures only a small number of outcomes could be pooled for statistical analysis.

Main Results

We identified five RCTs that randomised 544 children (three studies) and 205 adults (exclusively from two studies). They all compared saline irrigation to routine care or other nose sprays, rather than placebo. We included two new trials in this update, which did not contribute data of sufficient size or quality to materially change the original findings. Most trials were small and we judged them to be of low quality, contributing to an unclear risk of bias. Most outcome measures differed greatly between included studies and therefore could not be pooled. Most results showed no difference between nasal saline treatment and control. However, one larger trial, conducted with children, did show a significant reduction in nasal secretion score (mean difference (MD) -0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.48 to -0.14) and nasal breathing (obstruction) score (MD -0.33, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.19) in the saline group. However, a MD of -0.33 on a four-point symptom scale may have minimal clinical significance. The trial also showed a significant reduction in the use of decongestant medication by the saline group. Minor nasal discomfort and/or irritation was the only side effect reported by a minority of participants.

Authors' Conclusions

Nasal saline irrigation possibly has benefits for relieving the symptoms of acute URTIs. However, the included trials were generally too small and had a high risk of bias, reducing confidence in the evidence supporting this. Future trials should involve larger numbers of participants and report standardised and clinically meaningful outcome measures.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years [^bf3247ca]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics — acute bacterial sinusitis diagnosis in children emphasizes differentiating it from uncomplicated viral upper respiratory infection (URI): Uncomplicated viral URIs typically last 5 to 7 days, with respiratory symptoms peaking by days 3 to 6, fever and constitutional symptoms disappearing in the first 24 to 48 hours, and some resolving signs persisting after day 10. Persistence without improvement of nasal discharge (of any quality) or daytime cough (which may be worse at night), or both, suggests acute sinusitis, yet only a minority (~6%–7%) of children with URI symptoms meet criteria for persistence. An alternative presentation is worsening ("double sickening") with substantial acute worsening of respiratory symptoms or a new fever often on the sixth or seventh day after initial recovery. A severe-onset presentation is concurrent high fever (temperature > 39°C) and purulent nasal discharge for the first 3 to 4 days of an acute URI. Bad breath, fatigue, headache, and decreased appetite are not specific indicators, and physical examination, sinus percussion, and transillumination are not helpful; nasopharyngeal cultures do not reliably predict the etiology.

Acute bacterial sinusitis in children — diagnostic patterns and fever thresholds are outlined: Thick, colored, or cloudy nasal mucus alone does not diagnose sinusitis and fewer episodes progress to bacterial infection; most colds may include short fevers. Acute bacterial sinusitis is likely when illness is persistent (runny nose or daytime cough for at least 10 days without improvement), severe (fever temperature ≥ 39°C [102.2°F] for at least 3 days in a row with thick/colored/cloudy nasal mucus), or worsening (initial viral cold that then worsens with new-onset temperature ≥ 38°C [100.4°F] or markedly increased cough/runny nose).

Adult sinusitis guideline — antibiotics in chronic rhinosinusitis states that clinicians should not routinely prescribe antimicrobial therapy for adults with CRS without acute exacerbation or as a mandatory prerequisite for paranasal sinus imaging or surgery. The action statement identifies aggregate evidence quality Grade A from systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials with a high level of confidence, notes the role of patient preferences as limited, and specifies exceptions of acute exacerbation of CRS and odontogenic infection accompanying CRS, with policy level Recommendation. Supporting text notes that first-line treatment for CRS is nasal saline irrigation and intranasal corticosteroid spray, and that there is no recent evidence for widespread empiric usage of antibiotic therapy for treating CRS; a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 50 patients studied 3 weeks of treatment with 3 arms, and clinical improvement was noted with the irrigation and the oral steroid arms but not with the antibiotics.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for acute rhinosinusitis in adults: background [^72938921]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute rhinosinusitis apply to the diagnosis and treatment of acute maxillary and ethmoid rhinosinusitis in adults who are not immunocompromised.1. Most cases of acute rhinosinusitis diagnosed in ambulatory care are caused by uncomplicated viral upper respiratory tract infections. 2. Bacterial and viral rhinosinusitis are difficult to differentiate on clinical grounds. The clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be reserved for patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms lasting 7 days or more who have maxillary pain or tenderness in the face or teeth (especially when unilateral) and purulent nasal secretions. Patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms that last less than 7 days are unlikely to have bacterial infection, although rarely some patients with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis present with dramatic symptoms of severe unilateral maxillary pain, swelling, and fever.3. Sinus radiography is not recommended for diagnosis in routine cases. 4. Acute rhinosinusitis resolves without antibiotic treatment in most cases. Symptomatic treatment and reassurance is the preferred initial management strategy for patients with mild symptoms. Antibiotic therapy should be reserved for patients with moderately severe symptoms who meet the criteria for the clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and for those with severe rhinosinusitis symptoms-especially those with unilateral facial pain-regardless of duration of illness. For initial treatment, the most narrow-spectrum agent active against the likely pathogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, should be used.

### Nasal foreign body, an unanticipated complication of COVID-19 care: a case report [^860a7105]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has changed the way we practice medicine. Standards of care are evolving in an effort to diagnose, manage, and treat the cause of this global pandemic, as well as to protect the health care workforce. These practices can have unexpected and potentially dangerous consequences, particularly for patient populations with confounding factors that put them at increased risk for complications and poor outcomes.

Case Report

A 52-year-old previously healthy woman presented with 4 days of nasal pain and discharge after using a home collection kit in an attempt to obtain a nasopharyngeal viral sample for COVID-19 testing. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? With treatments, policies, and procedures that are rapidly evolving and often deviating from established, evidence-based, usual care in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, emergency physicians must be cognizant of and monitor for poor outcomes and potential downstream complications, especially in underserved patient populations.

Severe acute bacterial sinusitis is defined as temperature ≥ 39°C with purulent nasal discharge present concurrently for at least 3 consecutive days; worsening illness is defined by sudden worsening with new-onset fever ≥ 38° C/100.4° F or substantial increase in nasal discharge or cough after transient improvement; persistent illness is defined by nasal discharge, daytime cough, or both, persisting for > 10 days without improvement. A footnote notes an "Opportunity for shared decision-making" and that a mechanism must be in place to ensure follow-up and begin antibiotics if the child worsens at any time or fails to improve within 3 days of observation.

### Treatment of the common cold [^9c9f98f1]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute upper respiratory tract infections are extremely common in adults and children, but only a few safe and effective treatments are available. Patients typically present with nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sore throat, cough, general malaise, and/or low-grade fever. Informing patients about the self-limited nature of the common cold can help manage expectations, limit antibiotic use, and avoid over-the-counter purchases that may not help. Treatments with proven effectiveness for cold symptoms in adults include over-the-counter analgesics, zinc, nasal decongestants with or without antihistamines, and ipratropium for cough. Lower-quality evidence suggests that Lactobacillus casei may be beneficial in older adults. The only established safe and effective treatments for children are acetylcysteine, honey (for children one year and older), nasal saline irrigation, intranasal ipratropium, and topical application of ointment containing camphor, menthol, and eucalyptus oils. Over-the-counter cold medications should not be used in children younger than four years. Counseling patients about the importance of good hand hygiene is the best way to prevent transmission of cold viruses.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years [^b8aacb9e]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Intranasal corticosteroids as adjuvant therapy in pediatric acute bacterial sinusitis are described with limited and methodologically variable evidence: Potential adjuvant therapy for acute sinusitis might include intranasal corticosteroids, and a Cochrane review in children found no appropriately designed studies to determine effectiveness. There have been 2 trials in children, and these studies showed a greater rate of complete resolution or greater reduction in symptoms in patients receiving the steroid preparation, although the effects were modest; however, nearly all of these studies suffered from substantial methodologic problems with variable inclusion criteria, mixed allergic status, and different outcome criteria that make deriving a clear conclusion difficult. The intranasal steroids studied include budesonide, flunisolide, fluticasone, and mometasone, and there is no reason to believe that one steroid would be more effective than another, provided equivalent doses are used. Potential harm includes increased cost, difficulty administering nasal sprays in young children, nasal irritation and epistaxis, and potential systemic adverse effects, although no clinically significant steroid adverse effects have been discovered in studies in children.

### Corticosteroids for the common cold [^a6b7efce]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The common cold is a frequent illness, which, although benign and self limiting, results in many consultations to primary care and considerable loss of school or work days. Current symptomatic treatments have limited benefit. Corticosteroids are an effective treatment in other upper respiratory tract infections and their anti-inflammatory effects may also be beneficial in the common cold. This updated review has included one additional study.

Objectives

To compare corticosteroids versus usual care for the common cold on measures of symptom resolution and improvement in children and adults.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 4), which includes the Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) Group's Specialised Register, the Database of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (2015, Issue 2), NHS Health Economics Database (2015, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1948 to May week 3, 2015) and EMBASE (January 2010 to May 2015).

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind, controlled trials comparing corticosteroids to placebo or to standard clinical management.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. We were unable to perform meta-analysis and instead present a narrative description of the available evidence.

Main Results

We included three trials (353 participants). Two trials compared intranasal corticosteroids to placebo and one trial compared intranasal corticosteroids to usual care; no trials studied oral corticosteroids. In the two placebo-controlled trials, no benefit of intranasal corticosteroids was demonstrated for duration or severity of symptoms. The risk of bias overall was low or unclear in these two trials. In a trial of 54 participants, the mean number of symptomatic days was 10.3 in the placebo group, compared to 10.7 in those using intranasal corticosteroids (P value = 0.72). A second trial of 199 participants reported no significant differences in the duration of symptoms. The single-blind trial in children aged two to 14 years, who were also receiving oral antibiotics, had inadequate reporting of outcome measures regarding symptom resolution. The overall risk of bias was high for this trial. Mean symptom severity scores were significantly lower in the group receiving intranasal steroids in addition to oral amoxicillin. One placebo-controlled trial reported the presence of rhinovirus in nasal aspirates and found no differences. Only one of the three trials reported on adverse events; no differences were found. Two trials reported secondary bacterial infections (one case of sinusitis, one case of acute otitis media; both in the corticosteroid groups). A lack of comparable outcome measures meant that we were unable to combine the data.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence does not support the use of intranasal corticosteroids for symptomatic relief from the common cold. However, there were only three trials, one of which was very poor quality, and there was limited statistical power overall. Further large, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adults and children are required to answer this question.

Nasal saline irrigation — preparation and effectiveness: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and FDA recommend that if tap water is used to prepare saline for nasal irrigation, water should be boiled for 1 to 5 minutes before cooling and use. A systematic review concluded that when nasal sinus irrigation was performed regularly over a limited period of up to 7 weeks, there was a positive effect on all investigated outcomes in adults and children with AR, and a 2018 Cochrane review concluded it may reduce patient-reported disease severity compared with no saline irrigation at up to 3 months in both adults and children with AR; however, saline nasal irrigation alone is less effective than intranasal corticosteroid (INCS) alone for AR in children.

Table 5 — Patient information sheet on diagnosis of acute sinusitis — defines key diagnostic features and distinguishes viral from bacterial illness for adults. Sinusitis, also called rhinosinusitis, affects about 1 in 8 adults annually. Acute sinusitis is present with up to 4 weeks of cloudy or colored nasal drainage plus one or both of the following: a stuffy, congested, or blocked nose, and pain, pressure or fullness in the face, head, or around the eyes. Acute viral sinusitis is likely if illness has been present less than 10 days without worsening, whereas acute bacterial sinusitis is likely when there is no improvement within 10 days of getting sick or when symptoms worsen within 10 days after beginning to get better. Because treatment differs by cause, acute viral sinusitis does not benefit from antibiotics, but some patients with acute bacterial sinusitis may get better faster with an antibiotic.

### Intranasal corticosteroids and saline: usage and adherence in chronic rhinosinusitis patients [^c9d1cd5e]. The Laryngoscope (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Intranasal saline irrigations and intranasal corticosteroids are supported by level-1 evidence for medical management of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). We sought to study adherence with these medications.

Methods

Prospective study of 174 patients with CRS. Patients reported their usage of intranasal saline irrigation and intranasal corticosteroid over the preceding 3 months, at presentation, and a subsequent follow-up visit 3 to 12 months later. Adherence was defined as reported medication usage for ≥ 6 days per week.

Results

At the time of presentation, 44.3% of patients were using an intranasal corticosteroid spray or irrigation ≥ 6 days/week, whereas only 24.1% were using saline irrigation ≥ 6 days per week. At follow-up, 60.3% of patients were using either an intranasal corticosteroid spray or irrigation ≥ 6 days per week, whereas 35.6% were using saline irrigation ≥ 6 days per week. Adherence with intranasal corticosteroids was associated with comorbid asthma (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.68, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10–6.50, P = 0.029), allergy (OR = 2.22, 95% CI: 1.05–4.71, P = 0.037), and change in 22-item Sinonasal Outcome Test score (OR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.96–0.99, P = 0.027). Use of intranasal corticosteroid sprays versus irrigations (OR = 2.56, 95% CI: 0.84–7.83, P = 0.099) was suggestive of association with improved adherence. Adherence with intranasal saline irrigation was associated with age (OR = 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01–1.05, P = 0.034).

Conclusion

Usage and adherence with intranasal steroids and saline may be low in CRS patients even with management in a tertiary level, subspecialty rhinology clinic. Adherence with medications represents a major opportunity for improving patient care and outcomes, specifically by targeting patients with lower disease burden and improving convenience of medications.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^e93f264a]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyp (CRSwNP) with symptoms more than 12 weeks is evaluated and managed using an algorithm that begins with evaluation (sinus CT and/or nasal endoscopy, consider culture, consider evaluation for aeroallergens — especially perennial aeroallergens — and other environmental triggers, and consider evaluation for immunodeficiency), followed by initial treatment with topical steroids, nasal saline irrigation, and an oral steroid, with consideration of an oral antibiotic (culture-based, if possible). After the decision point "Treatment successful?", the Yes branch leads to follow up to consider further evaluation of underlying risk factors and to continue individualized medical therapy; the No branch leads to additional treatment and evaluation including sinus CT if not done before (MRI for special cases), consideration of an alternate oral antibiotic, culture if not done before, consideration of immunodeficiency if not done before, consultation by an otolaryngologist for surgery, consideration of aspirin desensitization for aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), consideration of allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS), continuation of topical steroid and nasal saline irrigation, and management of comorbid asthma if present. Additional notes state that nasal examination may show mucosal erythema, edema, and purulent secretions in addition to polyps; evaluation should include coronal sinus CT scan, and the CT scan should ideally be performed 4 to 6 weeks after initiation of medical therapy; nasal polyps are relatively uncommon in children, and their presence should prompt evaluation for possible CF; and patients benefit from continued individualized medical therapy, including, when indicated, allergy management.

- **Pathophysiology**: ABRS is mostly caused by S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza, and M. catarrhalis.
- **Disease course**: Nasal and paranasal infection results in ABRS, which causes clinical manifestations of nasal congestion and obstruction, purulent nasal discharge, facial pain or pressure, fever, fatigue, cough, hyposmia, ear pressure, headache, and halitosis. Disease progression may result in orbital and CNS complications.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: ABRS with ocular complications is associated with a 3.17% mortality rate.

### Chronic rhinosinusitis [^02911e91]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is an inflammatory disease of the nose and paranasal sinuses, with a prevalence of approximately 1% to 7%. It is defined by the presence of at least two cardinal symptoms (nasal blockage, obstruction, or congestion; anterior or posterior nasal drainage; facial pain or pressure; and hyposmia) for at least three consecutive months, with objective findings on imaging or nasal endoscopy. CRS can result in significant patient costs and lower quality of life due to severe fatigue, depression, and sometimes reduced cognitive function. The condition is categorized as primary or secondary and with or without nasal polyps. Treatment is directed at reducing symptoms, improving mucus clearance, reducing inflammation, enhancing ciliary function, and removing bacteria and biofilms from the nasal mucosa. First-line treatment comprises nasal saline irrigation and intranasal corticosteroids. Acute exacerbation of CRS is common and is defined as a transient worsening of symptoms. The role of oral antibiotics and oral corticosteroids for acute exacerbations is unclear. Optimal maintenance therapy can help alleviate exacerbations. Patients with refractory CRS that is not responsive to first-line treatment and patients with alarm symptoms should be referred to an otolaryngologist for further evaluation and consideration of surgical management. Identifying patients who have CRS with nasal polyps or comorbid conditions such as atopic dermatitis, asthma, or eosinophilic esophagitis is especially important to ensure they are referred to a specialist for consideration of biologic therapy.

Management preferences

There were three predominant sentiments that were reported by participants when describing their preferences for managing their AR, all of which related to medication use and selection. Firstly, a preference not to medicate at all with the exception of a nasal saline wash or mist. Secondly, those who reluctantly medicate, when they felt the symptoms were otherwise intolerable. Thirdly, those who want to take any form of treatment in order to be symptom free.

The first group that had a preference not to medicate, represented people who did not believe that medication worked and those that had beliefs against medication. A subset of participants felt that they had tried all available AR treatments and nothing cured or completely eliminated their symptoms, therefore taking symptom-relieving medicines was a waste of time and an unnecessary risk of experiencing adverse effects. Other participants who wished not to medicate, said that they ideologically preferred not to use medicines for their AR.

### Adult rhinosinusitis: diagnosis and management… [^1af9f801]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Nasal/sinus bacterial cultures should be reserved for the circumstances previously outlined. The most common organisms isolated from patients with acute rhinosinusitis include. 1, 10, 17, 19–21 Maintaining patient hydration by adequate oral fluid intake, supplemented by the use of saline nasal sprays as desired, is recommended. Although study results are only suggestive, some studies 8, 17, 19, 20 used a mucolytic, and most favored the use of an oral decongestant, for patients with severe nasal/sinus obstruction. This can be supplemented with the addition of a topical decongestant for three to five days. Oral antibiotics are recommended for seven to 14 days in patients with acute, recurrent acute or subacute bacterial rhinosinusitis 1, 2, 10, 17, 22.

The federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality recently analyzed the world's literature and concluded that amoxicillin or folate inhibitors are appropriate choices as initial therapy in an otherwise healthy adult population with uncomplicated, acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. Some experts favor a short course of oral steroid therapy in patients with acute rhinosinusitis to diminish tissue edema around the sinus ostia and to provide symptomatic relief. 1, 2, 10 This is controversial, given the potential for immunosuppression prolonging the underlying disease process.

Topical steroids are commonly used in symptomatic patients with subacute or chronic rhinosinusitis and who have or are suspected of having inhalant sensitivities; however, these preparations are relatively ineffective in patients with acute rhinosinusitis because they poorly penetrate the associated rhinorrhea. 1, 2, 10 Data on whether topical antihistamines or anticholinergic preparations have a deleterious effect on the course of bacterial rhinosinusitis are insufficient; however, sinus penetration of these preparations is minimal. Anticholinergic agents are often used to control the rhinorrhea associated with acute rhinosinusitis, which is more commonly viral than bacterial in origin.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^85e7b29f]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis — physical examination notes that when the clinical history suggests rhinosinusitis, a directed physical examination may help differentiate ABRS from allergic rhinitis (AR) or an uncomplicated viral URTI, and ABRS can be associated with edema and tenderness overlying an affected area with diplopia and proptosis as ominous signs. The nasal mucosa and quality of secretions should be assessed; secretions are clear and watery at the onset of URTIs but become thicker, colored (yellow-green), and opaque after a few days, and usually remain purulent for several days before clearing. Typical colds last 5 to 7 days and rarely last as long as 10 days, and persistence of purulent secretions beyond 10 days in the middle meatus are a characteristic of ABRS. Diagnostic nasal endoscopy is the most effective means of visualizing the middle meatus; however, the absence of purulent discharge has not been proved to be a highly reliable indicator for the absence of ABRS, and conversely, the absence of purulent secretions does not exclude the possibility of active sinus infection. The oropharynx should be examined for signs of posterior pharyngeal mucopurulent secretions.

### Intranasal corticosteroids in management of acute sinusitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^0e917a22]. Annals of Family Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

Acute sinusitis is a common condition in ambulatory care, where it is frequently treated with antibiotics, despite little evidence of their benefit. Intranasal corticosteroids might relieve symptoms; however, evidence for this benefit is currently unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of intranasal corticosteroids on the symptoms of acute sinusitis.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Centre for Reviews and Dissemination databases until February 2011 for studies comparing intranasal corticosteroids with placebo in children or adults having clinical symptoms and signs of acute sinusitis or rhinosinusitis in ambulatory settings. We excluded chronic/allergic sinusitis. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the studies' methodologic quality.

Results

We included 6 studies having a total of 2,495 patients. In 5 studies, antibiotics were prescribed in addition to corticosteroids or placebo. Intranasal corticosteroids resulted in a significant, small increase in resolution of or improvement in symptoms at days 14 to 21 (risk difference [RD] = 0.08; 95% CI, 0.03–0.13). Analysis of individual symptom scores revealed most consistently significant benefits for facial pain and congestion. Subgroup analysis by time of reported outcomes showed a significant beneficial effect at 21 days (RD = 0.11; 95% CI, 0.06–0.17), but not at 14 to 15 days (RD = 0.05; 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.11). Meta-regression analysis of trials using different doses of mometasone furoate showed a significant dose-response relationship (P = 0.02).

Conclusions

Intranasal corticosteroids offer a small therapeutic benefit in acute sinusitis, which may be greater with high doses and with courses of 21 days' duration. Further trials are needed in antibiotic-naïve patients.

### No evidence for distinguishing bacterial from viral acute rhinosinusitis using symptom duration and purulent rhinorrhea: a systematic review of the evidence base [^108b507f]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the diagnostic value of symptom duration and purulent rhinorrhea in adults suspected of having acute bacterial rhinosinusitis.

Data Sources

PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library.

Review Methods

We performed a comprehensive systematic search on March 28, 2013. We included studies on the diagnostic value of duration of symptoms and purulent rhinorrhea in patients suspected of having acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. We assessed study design of included articles for directness of evidence and risk of bias. We extracted prevalence and positive and negative predictive values.

Results

Of 4173 unique publications, we included 1 study with high directness of evidence and moderate risk of bias. The prior probability of bacterial rhinosinusitis was 0.29 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.24–0.35); we could not extract posterior probabilities. Odds ratios (95% CI) from univariate analysis were 1.03 (0.78–1.36) for duration of symptoms and 2.69 (1.39–5.18) for colored discharge on the floor of the nasal cavity.

Conclusion and Recommendation

We included 1 study with moderate risk of bias, reporting data in such a manner that we could not assess the value of symptom duration and purulent rhinorrhea in adults suspected of having acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. Recommendations to distinguish between a viral and a bacterial source based on purulent rhinorrhea are not supported by evidence, and the decision to prescribe antibiotic treatment should not depend on its presence. Based on judgment driven by theory and subsidiary evidence of a greater likelihood of bacterial rhinosinusitis after 10 days, antibiotic therapy may seem a reasonable empirical option.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^1c9682af]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) definitions — diagnostic thresholds and subtypes are specified as follows: ARS involves up to 4 weeks of purulent nasal drainage with nasal obstruction, facial pain–pressure–fullness, or both, with discharge described as cloudy or colored and typical features of obstruction and facial pain detailed. A clinician should diagnose viral rhinosinusitis (VRS) when symptoms or signs are present less than 10 days and are not worsening. A clinician should diagnose acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) when symptoms or signs fail to improve within 10 days or more beyond the onset of upper respiratory symptoms, or worsen within 10 days after an initial improvement (double worsening). Facial pain–pressure–fullness without purulent nasal discharge is insufficient to establish ARS.

### Saline irrigation for chronic rhinosinusitis [^de9ca250]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

This review is one of six looking at the primary medical management options for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Chronic rhinosinusitis is common and is characterised by inflammation of the lining of the nose and paranasal sinuses leading to nasal blockage, nasal discharge, facial pressure/pain and loss of sense of smell. The condition can occur with or without nasal polyps. Nasal saline irrigation is commonly used to improve patient symptoms.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of saline irrigation in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 9); MEDLINE; EMBASE; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 30 October 2015.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a follow-up period of at least three months comparing saline delivered to the nose by any means (douche, irrigation, drops, spray or nebuliser) with (a) placebo, (b) no treatment or (c) other pharmacological interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL), patient-reported disease severity and the commonest adverse event - epistaxis. Secondary outcomes included general HRQL, endoscopic nasal polyp score, computerised tomography (CT) scan score and the adverse events of local irritation and discomfort. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics.

Main Results

We included two RCTs (116 adult participants). One compared large-volume (150 ml) hypertonic (2%) saline irrigation with usual treatment over a six-month period; the other compared 5 mL nebulised saline twice a day with intranasal corticosteroids, treating participants for three months and evaluating them on completion of treatment and three months later. Large-volume, hypertonic nasal saline versus usual care One trial included 76 adult participants (52 intervention, 24 control) with or without polyps. Disease-specific HRQL was reported using the Rhinosinusitis Disability Index (RSDI; 0 to 100, 100 = best quality of life). At the end of three months of treatment, patients in the saline group were better than those in the placebo group (mean difference (MD) 6.3 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 11.71) and at six months there was a greater effect (MD 13.5 points, 95% CI 9.63 to 17.37). We assessed the evidence to be of low quality for the three months follow-up and very low quality for the six months follow-up. Patient-reported disease severity was evaluated using a "single-item sinus symptom severity assessment" but the range of scores is not stated, making it impossible for us to determine the meaning of the data presented. No adverse effects data were collected in the control group but 23% of participants in the saline group experienced side effects including epistaxis. General HRQL was measured using SF-12 (0 to 100, 100 = best quality of life). No difference was found after three months of treatment (low quality evidence) but at six months there was a small difference favouring the saline group, which may not be of clinical significance and has high uncertainty (MD 10.5 points, 95% CI 0.66 to 20.34) (very low quality evidence). Low-volume, nebulised saline versus intranasal corticosteroids One trial included 40 adult participants with polyps. Our primary outcome of disease-specific HRQL was not reported. At the end of treatment (three months) the patients who had intranasal corticosteroids had less severe symptoms (MD -13.50, 95% CI -14.44 to -12.56); this corresponds to a large effect size. We assessed the evidence to be of very low quality.

Authors' Conclusions

The two studies were very different in terms of included populations, interventions and comparisons and so it is therefore difficult to draw conclusions for practice. The evidence suggests that there is no benefit of a low-volume (5 ml) nebulised saline spray over intranasal steroids. There is some benefit of daily, large-volume (150 ml) saline irrigation with a hypertonic solution when compared with placebo, but the quality of the evidence is low for three months and very low for six months of treatment.

CRS-directed antibiotics and steroids — Clinicians should use systemic antibiotics for acute exacerbations of CRS; however, in some patients, this may not be necessary (Rec, C). Consider a 3- to 6-week course of topical antibiotics for CRS (Rec, C). Consider the use of systemic antibiotics plus a short course of oral steroids in the treatment of CRS; greater benefit with antibiotics has been reported in CRSsNP than in CRSwNP (Rec, A). Consider a short course of oral steroids for the treatment of CRSwNP (Rec, C). Use short-term treatment with oral steroids in CRSwNP because it decreases nasal polyp size and symptoms (StrRec, A). Use intranasal corticosteroid (INS; sprays and aerosols) for the treatment of CRSwNP and CRSsNP (StrRec, A).

### Hospital-acquired sinusitis is a common cause of fever of unknown origin in orotracheally intubated critically ill patients [^3fa31982]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

On the basis of the results of our study we recommend that hospital-acquired sinusitis be considered in all patients with FUO in the ICU in whom a cause of fever is not immediately apparent from initial examination and chest X-ray. SXR or ultrasound or (if possible) a CT scan should be included in the diagnostic work-up, and sinus puncture with drainage should be performed in case of abnormal or equivocal findings. In our study all procedures were performed at thr bedside; 40% of patients with confirmed sinusitis required repeat drainage, but no patients required more than two procedures.

All nasal tubes should be removed if sinusitis is suspected; antibiotics should be started empirically or based on Gram staining, and adjusted for final culture results. In most patients temperature normalises within 48 hours; this was also observed in our study. Radiological signs of sinusitis clear more slowly but should disappear within ± 1 week.

The results of our study have led to the implementation of several measures to reduce the incidence of sinusitis. First, nasogastric tubes are no longer used in intubated patients unless it is expected that the endotracheal tube can be removed within 24 hours. Gastric tubes in all other patients are now inserted through the mouth. Second, patients intubated for ≥ 24 hours now routinely receive topical administration of saline 0.9% and/or decongestants such as xylometazoline drops in the nasal cavities. Thirdly, the nursing staff keeps a far more rigorous watch for signs of purulent nasal discharge in all patients, and diagnostic procedures such as X-sinus are performed if such discharge is observed. Finally, the routine diagnostic work-up in patients who develop fever in the ICU now includes an SXR. Drainage (both as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool) takes place in all patients with clear or equivocal signs of sinusitis. Topical decongestants are used to reduce oedema and facilitate drainage. In patients with clear SXR in whom no other diagnosis is established, SXR is repeated after 48 hours. These measures have led to a marked reduction in the incidence of sinusitis in our ICU.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) — long-term macrolide antibiotics: Long-term use of macrolide antibiotics has been popularized by reports suggesting that macrolides have anti-inflammatory effects; however, clinical studies showing beneficial effects are quite limited and do not clearly differentiate effects in CRSsNP or CRSwNP. In a prospective randomized controlled trial, 90 patients with CRSsNP or CRSwNP were randomly assigned to medical vs surgical treatment; medical therapy consisted of erythromycin 500 mg twice daily for 2 weeks followed by 250 mg twice daily for 10 weeks, plus alkaline nasal irrigation and intranasal corticosteroids for 12 weeks, and both groups improved with no significant differences between groups. A randomized, placebo-controlled investigation of roxithromycin at 150 mg/d for 12 weeks showed a statistically significant change from baseline in Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-20 score at 12 weeks in the roxithromycin group that was not seen with placebo. In another study, 60 patients with CRSsNP or CRSwNP were randomized to azithromycin 500 mg/d for 3 days and then 500 mg weekly for 11 weeks versus placebo, and no significant differences were found between groups at the end of treatment.

Severe-onset cases are presumed bacterial because "a temperature of at least 39°C/102.2°F coexisting for at least 3 consecutive days with purulent nasal discharge is not consistent with the well-documented pattern of acute viral URI", and "children with worsening-course acute bacterial sinusitis have a clinical course that is also not consistent with the steady improvement that characterizes an uncomplicated viral URI"; additionally, "In both guidelines, however, children presenting with severe or worsening illness (which was not defined explicitly in the 2001 guideline) are to receive antibiotic therapy".

### Clinical practice guideline: allergic rhinitis [^30e575e1]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Allergic rhinitis (AR) is one of the most common diseases affecting adults. It is the most common chronic disease in children in the United States today and the fifth most common chronic disease in the United States overall. AR is estimated to affect nearly 1 in every 6 Americans and generates $2 to $5 billion in direct health expenditures annually. It can impair quality of life and, through loss of work and school attendance, is responsible for as much as $2 to $4 billion in lost productivity annually. Not surprisingly, myriad diagnostic tests and treatments are used in managing this disorder, yet there is considerable variation in their use. This clinical practice guideline was undertaken to optimize the care of patients with AR by addressing quality improvement opportunities through an evaluation of the available evidence and an assessment of the harm-benefit balance of various diagnostic and management options.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this guideline is to address quality improvement opportunities for all clinicians, in any setting, who are likely to manage patients with AR as well as to optimize patient care, promote effective diagnosis and therapy, and reduce harmful or unnecessary variations in care. The guideline is intended to be applicable for both pediatric and adult patients with AR. Children under the age of 2 years were excluded from the clinical practice guideline because rhinitis in this population may be different than in older patients and is not informed by the same evidence base. The guideline is intended to focus on a limited number of quality improvement opportunities deemed most important by the working group and is not intended to be a comprehensive reference for diagnosing and managing AR. The recommendations outlined in the guideline are not intended to represent the standard of care for patient management, nor are the recommendations intended to limit treatment or care provided to individual patients.

Action Statements

The development group made a strong recommendation that clinicians recommend intranasal steroids for patients with a clinical diagnosis of AR whose symptoms affect their quality of life. The development group also made a strong recommendation that clinicians recommend oral second-generation/less sedating antihistamines for patients with AR and primary complaints of sneezing and itching. The panel made the following recommendations: (1) Clinicians should make the clinical diagnosis of AR when patients present with a history and physical examination consistent with an allergic cause and 1 or more of the following symptoms: nasal congestion, runny nose, itchy nose, or sneezing. Findings of AR consistent with an allergic cause include, but are not limited to, clear rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, pale discoloration of the nasal mucosa, and red and watery eyes. (2) Clinicians should perform and interpret, or refer to a clinician who can perform and interpret, specific IgE (skin or blood) allergy testing for patients with a clinical diagnosis of AR who do not respond to empiric treatment, or when the diagnosis is uncertain, or when knowledge of the specific causative allergen is needed to target therapy. (3) Clinicians should assess patients with a clinical diagnosis of AR for, and document in the medical record, the presence of associated conditions such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, sleep-disordered breathing, conjunctivitis, rhinosinusitis, and otitis media. (4) Clinicians should offer, or refer to a clinician who can offer, immunotherapy (sublingual or subcutaneous) for patients with AR who have inadequate response to symptoms with pharmacologic therapy with or without environmental controls. The panel recommended against (1) clinicians routinely performing sinonasal imaging in patients presenting with symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of AR and (2) clinicians offering oral leukotriene receptor antagonists as primary therapy for patients with AR. The panel group made the following options: (1) Clinicians may advise avoidance of known allergens or may advise environmental controls (ie, removal of pets; the use of air filtration systems, bed covers, and acaricides [chemical agents formulated to kill dust mites]) in patients with AR who have identified allergens that correlate with clinical symptoms. (2) Clinicians may offer intranasal antihistamines for patients with seasonal, perennial, or episodic AR. (3) Clinicians may offer combination pharmacologic therapy in patients with AR who have inadequate response to pharmacologic monotherapy. (4) Clinicians may offer, or refer to a surgeon who can offer, inferior turbinate reduction in patients with AR with nasal airway obstruction and enlarged inferior turbinates who have failed medical management. (5) Clinicians may offer acupuncture, or refer to a clinician who can offer acupuncture, for patients with AR who are interested in nonpharmacologic therapy. The development group provided no recommendation regarding the use of herbal therapy for patients with AR.

Otolaryngologists should also monitor for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) in PCD patients. CRS is estimated to affect over 50% of patients with PCD 31 and nasal endoscopy (as permitted by age) can be used to identify polyps which may be exacerbating already poor mucociliary clearance. Nasal polyposis has been observed in up to 15% of PCD patients. 29, 113 Although CRS is not generally life threatening, it substantially affects quality of life. 114 Daily saline irrigation has been demonstrated as safe and beneficial in patients with CRS. 115 Anecdotally, in PCD patients, saline nasal irrigations are beneficial, but studies demonstrating their efficacy are lacking. Given the minimal side effect profile and likelihood for benefit, nasal irrigations are generally encouraged for symptomatic CRS relief in PCD. The effects of saline irrigation are likely increased after functional endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS), as the saline solution will more easily reach the sinus mucosa through post‐surgical ostia. Thus, ESS is often performed in PCD patients and may improve lower respiratory tract disease in some patients. 116 Antibiotics and nasal steroids may be used in acute on chronic exacerbations of rhinosinusitis; however, a recent review showed lack of consensus on the treatment of CRS in children with PCD, 113 and there are no randomized, controlled, or long‐term prospective CRS studies in PCD.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^212e61d9]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) are supported as effective management, with systematic reviews in CRS with polyps showing improved outcomes in reducing symptoms with excellent safety and minimal adverse effects, while data are limited for CRS without polyps. There are no recommendations suggesting a superior topical corticosteroid or recommendations on INCS dosing; however, epistaxis was seen in higher doses of INCS. In patients post sinus surgery with moderate to severe disease not controlled with INCS, intranasal steroid irrigations using budesonide were beneficial in controlling symptoms, though lack of FDA approval and limited evidence are noted, and the GUG felt this approach was beneficial in select patients postendoscopic surgery. EDS fluticasone has also shown benefits in CRSsNP based on 2 RCTs. Adverse events of topical nasal steroids are generally minor, and long-term use has not been shown to impact systemic cortisol levels or increase ocular risks; the GUG felt that a specific treatment length cannot be stated and that decisions should be individualized to achieve symptom control with the lowest effective dose.

### Signs and symptoms that differentiate acute sinusitis from viral upper respiratory tract infection [^24683d69]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Differentiating acute bacterial sinusitis from viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI) is challenging; 20% to 40% of children diagnosed with acute sinusitis based on clinical criteria likely have an uncomplicated URI. The objective of this study was to determine which signs and symptoms could be used to identify the subgroup of children who meet current clinical criteria for sinusitis but who nevertheless have a viral URI.

We obtained sinus radiographs in consecutive children meeting a priori clinical criteria for acute sinusitis. We considered the subgroup of children with completely normal sinus radiographs to have an uncomplicated URI despite meeting the clinical diagnostic criteria for sinusitis. We examined the utility of signs and symptoms in identifying children with URI.

Results

Of 258 children enrolled, 54 (20.9%) children had completely normal radiographs. The absence of green nasal discharge, the absence of disturbed sleep and mild symptoms were associated with a diagnosis of URI. No physical exam findings were particularly helpful in distinguishing between children with normal versus abnormal radiographs.

Conclusions

Among children meeting current criteria for the diagnosis of acute sinusitis, those with mild symptoms are significantly more likely to have a URI than those with severe symptoms. In addition to assessing overall severity of symptoms, practitioners should ask about sleep disturbance and green nasal discharge when assessing children with suspected sinusitis; their absence favors a diagnosis of URI.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^d58258f6]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) — definition and evaluation: ABRS is defined as symptoms and signs for less than 12 weeks, and the diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) is based primarily on clinical history, physical examination, and possibly ancillary evaluations, including endoscopy or radiographic imaging. General examination includes an evaluation for signs of upper airway and sinus inflammation associated with nasal mucosal edema and purulent secretions, and other objective measurements of airflow obstruction, such as office spirometry, should be considered in any patient with possible rhinosinusitis and cough.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years [^fb734ce7]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline regarding the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children and adolescents.

Methods

Analysis of the medical literature published since the last version of the guideline (2001).

Results

The diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis is made when a child with an acute upper respiratory tract infection (URI) presents with (1) persistent illness (nasal discharge [of any quality] or daytime cough or both lasting more than 10 days without improvement), (2) a worsening course (worsening or new onset of nasal discharge, daytime cough, or fever after initial improvement), or (3) severe onset (concurrent fever[temperature ≥ 39°C/102.2°F] and purulent nasal discharge for at least 3 consecutive days). Clinicians should not obtain imaging studies of any kind to distinguish acute bacterial sinusitis from viral URI, because they do not contribute to the diagnosis; however, a contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan of the paranasal sinuses should be obtained whenever a child is suspected of having orbital or central nervous system complications. The clinician should prescribe antibiotic therapy for acute bacterial sinusitis in children with severe onset or worsening course. The clinician should either prescribe antibiotic therapy or offer additional observation for 3 days to children with persistent illness. Amoxicillin with or without clavulanate is the firstline treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis. Clinicians should reassess initial management if there is either a caregiver report of worsening(progression of initial signs/symptoms or appearance of new signs/symptoms) or failure to improve within 72 hours of initial management. If the diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis is confirmed in a child with worsening symptoms or failure to improve, then clinicians may change the antibiotic therapy for the child initially managed with antibiotic or initiate antibiotic treatment of the child initially managed with observation.

Conclusions

Changes in this revision include the addition of a clinical presentation designated as "worsening course", an option to treat immediately or observe children with persistent symptoms for 3 days before treating, and a review of evidence indicating that imaging is not necessary in children with uncomplicated acute bacterial sinusitis.

### Unified airway disease: medical management [^7bbbde39]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Concurrent chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) in the upper airway, and asthma in the lower airway, often have a shared underlying pathophysiology, namely type 2 inflammation; hence, the term "unified airway disease". The combination of CRSwNP and asthma is associated with uncontrolled disease. The range of treatment of CRSwNP includes intranasal corticosteroids, nasal saline irrigation, oral corticosteroids, antibiotics, and biologics. A combined clinical algorithm for the management of the upper and lower airways in type 2 inflammation will be beneficial, especially for patients with uncontrolled disease who may benefit from biologics.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^90d801cf]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) symptom course — timing aids classification: Between 5 and 10 days, persistent symptoms are consistent with VRS or may represent early ABRS; beyond 10 days, the probability of confirming a bacterial infection by sinus aspiration is about 60%. Consequently, when a patient meets the criteria for ARS, the clinician should distinguish between VRS and presumed ABRS, and purulent nasal drainage as a sole criterion cannot distinguish between viral and bacterial infection.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^a63d1f37]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, AAO-HNSF, AAO-HNS 2015 guidelines recommend to diagnose ABRS in patients with:

- symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis (purulent nasal drainage accompanied by nasal obstruction, facial pain/pressure/fullness, or both) persisting without evidence of improvement for ≥ 10 days after the onset of symptoms

- symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis worsening within 10 days after an initial improvement (double worsening).

Guideline definitions for evidence-based statements — clinician implications: Table 1 provides categories (strong recommendation, recommendation, option, and no recommendation) with explicit practice implications. Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. Clinicians would be prudent to follow a recommendation, but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. Clinicians should consider the option in their decision-making, and patient preference may have a substantial role. Clinicians should be alert to new published evidence that clarifies the balance of benefit versus harm.

### Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis in adults: part II. treatment [^7acda3df]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Although most cases of acute rhinosinusitis are caused by viruses, acute bacterial rhinosinusitis is a fairly common complication. Even though most patients with acute rhinosinusitis recover promptly without it, antibiotic therapy should be considered in patients with prolonged or more severe symptoms. To avoid the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, narrow-spectrum antibiotics such as amoxicillin should be used for 10 to 14 days. In patients with mild disease who have beta-lactam allergy, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or doxycycline are options. Second-line antibiotics should be considered if the patient has moderate disease, recent antibiotic use (past six weeks), or no response to treatment within 72 hours. Amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium and fluoroquinolones have the best coverage for Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. In patients with beta-lactam hypersensitivity who have moderate disease, a fluoroquinolone should be prescribed. The evidence supporting the use of ancillary treatments is limited. Decongestants often are recommended, and there is some evidence to support their use, although topical decongestants should not be used for more than three days to avoid rebound congestion. Topical ipratropium and the sedating antihistamines have anticholinergic effects that maybe beneficial, but there are no clinical studies supporting this possibility. Nasal irrigation with hypertonic and normal saline has been beneficial in chronic sinusitis and has no serious adverse effects. Nasal corticosteroids also may be beneficial in treating chronic sinusitis. Mist, zinc salt lozenges, echinacea extract, and vitamin C have no proven benefit in the treatment of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis.

Case presentation

A 70-year-old woman visited our clinic due to periorbital swelling with mild ocular pain of the left eye for 4 days (Fig. 1). She had no history of trauma and ophthalmological surgery. She had hypertension but no bleeding disorders. She had no fever and upper respiratory infection symptoms. Visual acuity was corrected to 20/20 in her right eye and 10/20 in her left eye. Intraocular pressure was 27 mmHg in the left. Elevation, depression and adduction were severely limited in the left eye (Fig. 1). Hertel exophthalmometry demonstrated 4.5mm of proptosis in the left eye. The pupils were isocoric and there were no relative afferent pupillary defects in either eye. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate(ESR) was slightly elevated at 44 mm/h. Coagulation profile and blood glucose level were normal.

Fig. 1
Limited extraocular muscle movement in terms of elevation, depression and adduction of the left eye. A well-demarcated biconvex non-enhancing soft tissue density lesion can be seen in the left superior subperiosteal area on non-enhanced CT

Computed tomography(CT) revealed a well-demarcated biconvex non-enhancing soft tissue density lesion in the left superior subperiosteal area (Fig. 1). There was opacification of the frontal and ethmoidal sinus containing hyperdense material with bony thinning. Superior orbitotomy was performed via an eyebrow incision. Brown serous discharge was completely drained from the left superior subperiosteal space.

On postoperative day 3, there were no limitations on left eye movement (Fig. 2). Visual acuity was elevated to 16/20 in her left eye. CT revealed a decrease in the size of the subperiosteal lesion (Fig. 2). The brown serous discharge was made up of fibrin clots without any microorganismal growth. Final diagnosis of orbital subperiosteal hematoma associated with frontal and ethmoidal sinusitis was reached. We considered that thrombophlebitis with venous stasis induced hematoma in subperiosteal space. For chronic sinusitis treatment, we considered oral antibiotics, intranasal steroids and pseudoephedrine and nasal irrigation with normal saline. We referred this patient to otorhinolaryngology for further evaluation and treatment.
