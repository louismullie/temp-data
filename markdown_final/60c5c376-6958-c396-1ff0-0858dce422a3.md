## Question

what's a good start levothyroxine dose for hypothyroidism for a female who weights 80 kg

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate starting levothyroxine dose for an 80 kg woman with hypothyroidism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this is overt primary hypothyroidism versus subclinical disease. Then, I should verify age and cardiovascular risk because that dictates whether to start full replacement or go low and slow. Next, I will calculate a weight-based estimate and consider whether to use actual versus ideal body weight. After that, I should adjust for sex-specific factors and common comorbidities. Finally, I will outline monitoring, titration, and special scenarios like pregnancy or malabsorption, and then synthesize a practical starting dose with a clear plan.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because dosing hinges on it. If this is overt primary hypothyroidism in a healthy, non-elderly adult without cardiac disease, guidelines and labels support starting at a full replacement dose, whereas subclinical hypothyroidism warrants lower starting doses and a more conservative approach, so I need to ensure I'm not conflating these scenarios before I proceed [^5f6f35a9] [^e4a4b9a2].

> Wait, let me verify the weight-based calculation before I anchor on a number. The standard full replacement estimate is about 1.6 mcg/kg/day using actual body weight in otherwise healthy adults, which for 80 kg equals 128 mcg/day; the FDA labeling cites approximately 1.6 mcg/kg/day as the average full replacement dose, and this aligns with ATA guidance to use full replacement in young, healthy patients with overt disease [^7cd5a384] [^5a6df355] [^5f6f35a9].

> Hold on, I should verify whether to use actual versus ideal body weight because obesity can distort requirements. Multiple sources caution that actual weight can overestimate dose in obesity, and some clinicians prefer ideal or lean body mass adjustments; observational data suggest women often require slightly higher per-kg doses when corrected for overweight, so using actual weight may be reasonable in non-obese patients but warrants caution in obesity, prompting consideration of a modest reduction or use of adjusted weight in BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² [^3e5344dc] [^d14b02f5] [^4f002997].

> I need to check age and cardiovascular status next because that changes the starting strategy. In patients over about 50–60 years or with known or suspected ischemic heart disease, guidelines recommend a low starting dose of 12.5–25 mcg/day with slow titration every 6–8 weeks to avoid precipitating angina or arrhythmias; conversely, in healthy adults under about 60–65 without cardiac disease, full replacement dosing is acceptable and may hasten biochemical control without excess cardiovascular events in prospective data [^7cd5a384] [^5a6df355] [^797fa9d9].

> Let me consider sex-specific nuances, even though the per-kilogram formula is typically applied similarly across sexes. Some data suggest premenopausal women may have slightly higher levothyroxine requirements per kilogram than men when using actual body weight, likely reflecting differences in lean mass and hormonal milieu; however, this effect is modest and often captured within the 1.6 mcg/kg/day estimate, so I should not overcorrect unless clinical response dictates otherwise [^d14b02f5] [^d9820518].

> Next, I should review special situations that could modify the starting dose. If the patient is pregnant or planning pregnancy, requirements rise early in gestation and many guidelines advise increasing the total weekly dose by about 30% as soon as pregnancy is confirmed, with trimester-specific TSH targets and closer monitoring; if there is malabsorption, celiac disease, or interacting drugs, absorption may be impaired and formulation or timing changes may be needed; if the etiology is post-thyroidectomy or central hypothyroidism, targets and monitoring differ, with free T4 guiding therapy rather than TSH in central disease [^1be19404] [^af64cc26] [^b8c254df].

> I will now examine the monitoring and titration cadence because starting dose is only half the equation. Dose adjustments should be based on TSH measured about 4–6 weeks after initiation or any change, with typical increments of 12.5–25 mcg until TSH is normalized; in older adults or those with cardiac disease, smaller increments and longer intervals are prudent, and I should double-check for drug–food interactions and adherence before escalating dose [^07a7b05d] [^7cd5a384] [^94d9d531].

> But wait, what if the patient is obese with a BMI over 30 kg/m²; could 1.6 mcg/kg/day over-replace her. Let me reconsider and adjust conservatively. In obesity, using actual weight can overestimate needs; strategies include using ideal body weight, a BMI-adjusted coefficient, or simply starting at the lower end of the weight-based range and titrating carefully; given 80 kg and assuming a BMI ≥ 30, a pragmatic approach is to start around 100–112 mcg/day and titrate to TSH rather than insisting on 128 mcg/day upfront, especially if she is sedentary or has lower lean mass [^3e5344dc] [^4f002997].

> Putting this together, my synthesis is as follows. For a healthy, non-elderly 80 kg woman with overt primary hypothyroidism and no cardiac disease, a full replacement start of about 125 mcg/day is reasonable, acknowledging the math yields 128 mcg and that 125 mcg is a standard tablet size facilitating adherence; if she is obese or there are concerns about over-replacement, starting at 100–112 mcg/day with planned early TSH check is sensible, whereas if she is over 60 or has ischemic heart disease, I should start 12.5–25 mcg/day and titrate slowly; for subclinical hypothyroidism, I would start 25–50 mcg/day and adjust based on TSH and symptoms rather than aiming for full replacement initially [^7cd5a384] [^5a6df355] [^5f6f35a9] [^e4a4b9a2].

> Final recommendation, with caveats: start levothyroxine at 125 mcg orally once daily if she is a healthy adult under about 60 years without cardiac disease, take it fasting 30–60 minutes before breakfast or at bedtime ≥ 3 hours after the last meal, recheck TSH in 6–8 weeks, and adjust by 12.5–25 mcg increments to a TSH target of about 0.5–2.5 mIU/L; if she is obese, older, or has cardiac disease, start lower at 100 mcg/day or 12.5–25 mcg/day respectively and titrate more slowly, and if subclinical, start 25–50 mcg/day and individualize to TSH and symptoms [^7cd5a384] [^3a9edc59] [^07a7b05d] [^e4a4b9a2].

For a healthy, non-elderly, 80 kg woman with overt hypothyroidism and no cardiac disease, the **typical starting levothyroxine dose is 1.6 mcg/kg/day**, which equals **128 mcg/day**. Round to **125 mcg/day** for practicality and titrate every 6–8 weeks to normalize TSH. In elderly or those with cardiac disease, start lower (12.5–50 mcg/day) and titrate slowly. Adjust for obesity, pregnancy, or drug interactions as needed [^7cd5a384] [^5f6f35a9] [^3e5344dc].

---

## Standard weight-based dosing

- **Standard dose**: 1.6 mcg/kg/day for healthy adults with overt hypothyroidism and no cardiac disease [^7cd5a384] [^5a6df355].
- **Calculation**: 80 kg × 1.6 mcg/kg/day = 128 mcg/day.
- **Practical rounding**: 125 mcg/day (common tablet strength) [^7cd5a384].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **ATA guidelines**: Use 1.6 mcg/kg/day for healthy adults; adjust for age, cardiac disease, and comorbidities [^5f6f35a9] [^dd726a0c].
- **FDA labeling**: Average full replacement is ~1.6 mcg/kg/day; adjust in 12.5–25 mcg steps every 4–6 weeks [^7cd5a384] [^5a6df355].
- **AACE/ATA**: Consider full replacement in young, healthy adults; titrate to normalize TSH [^6ddb8049] [^0af3b4a3].

## Factors influencing dosing adjustments

Several factors may necessitate **dose adjustments**:

| **Factor** | **Impact on dosing** | **Recommended adjustment** |
|-|-|-|
| Age (> 60 years) | Increased sensitivity to thyroid hormone | Start low (12.5–50 mcg/day); titrate slowly [^7cd5a384] [^95d0aac6] |
| Cardiovascular disease | Increased risk of adverse effects | Start low (12.5–50 mcg/day); titrate slowly [^7cd5a384] [^07a7b05d] |
| Obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m²) | Overestimation of dose with actual weight | Use ideal body weight or adjust dose downward [^3e5344dc] [^4f002997] |
| Pregnancy | Increased thyroid hormone requirements | Increase dose by ~30% immediately [^1be19404] |
| Drug interactions (e.g. calcium, iron, PPIs) | Reduced absorption | Separate dosing by ≥ 4 hours; consider higher dose [^94d9d531] |

---

## Monitoring and titration

- **Initial monitoring**: Check TSH 6–8 weeks after starting or changing dose [^07a7b05d].
- **Dose adjustments**: Change by 12.5–25 mcg every 4–6 weeks until TSH is normal [^07a7b05d].
- **Long-term monitoring**: Once stable, check TSH every 6–12 months [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Obesity**: Dosing based on actual weight may overestimate needs; consider ideal body weight or BMI-adjusted strategies [^3e5344dc] [^4f002997].
- **Elderly or cardiac patients**: Start low and titrate slowly to avoid adverse effects [^7cd5a384] [^95d0aac6].
- **Pregnancy**: Increase dose by ~30% as soon as pregnancy is confirmed [^1be19404].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Patient profile** | **Recommended starting dose** | **Titration strategy** |
|-|-|-|
| Healthy, non-elderly, no cardiac disease | 125 mcg/day (1.6 mcg/kg/day) | Adjust by 12.5–25 mcg every 4–6 weeks |
| Elderly or cardiac disease | 12.5–50 mcg/day | Adjust by 12.5–25 mcg every 6–8 weeks |
| Obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m²) | Adjusted dose (ideal body weight or BMI-based) | Individualized titration |
| Pregnancy | Increase by ~30% immediately | Frequent monitoring and adjustment |

---

The **typical starting dose** for an 80 kg woman with overt hypothyroidism and no cardiac disease is **125 mcg/day**, with titration to normalize TSH. Adjust for age, cardiac disease, obesity, pregnancy, and drug interactions as indicated [^7cd5a384] [^5f6f35a9].

### Optimal thyroid hormone replacement [^b2c45664]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a common endocrinopathy, and levothyroxine is frequently prescribed. Despite the basic tenets of initiating and adjusting levothyroxine being agreed on, there are many nuances and complexities to consistently maintaining euthyroidism. Understanding the impact of patient weight and residual thyroid function on initial levothyroxine dosage and consideration of age, comorbidities, thyrotropin goal, life stage, and quality of life as levothyroxine is adjusted can be challenging and continually evolving. Because levothyroxine is a lifelong medication, it is important to avoid risks from periods of overtreatment or undertreatment. For the subset of patients not restored to baseline health with levothyroxine, causes arising from all aspects of the patient's life (coexistent medical conditions, stressors, lifestyle, psychosocial factors) should be broadly considered. If such factors do not appear to be contributing, and biochemical euthyroidism has been successfully maintained, there may be benefit to a trial of combination therapy with levothyroxine and liothyronine. This is not supported by the majority of randomized clinical trials, but may be supported by other studies providing lower-quality evidence and by animal studies. Given this discrepancy, it is important that any trial of combination therapy be continued only as long as a patient benefit is being enjoyed. Monitoring for adverse effects, particularly in older or frail individuals, is necessary and combination therapy should not be used during pregnancy. A sustained-release liothyronine preparation has completed phase 1 testing and may soon be available for better designed and powered studies assessing whether combination therapy provides superior therapy for hypothyroidism.

### Establishing the adequate levothyroxine dose after total thyroidectomy: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^a686ab7e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Taking together the reported findings, the current guideline recommendation of a standard 1.6 µg/kg LT4 dose does not appear to be fully supported by evidence.

According to the study aim, the results of the present systematic review show that just above one-third of athyreotic patients have normal TSH at their first postsurgery follow-up independently of the strategy used to decide the LT4 starting dose. Despite LT4 therapy being a well-established and safe treatment, achieving euthyroidism at the first postthyroidectomy follow-up remains challenging. Although some differences in terms of euthyroidism rates were reached, previously tested dosing strategies ranging from very simple ones to rather complex algorithms do not fully account for interindividual variability, underscoring the limitations of a one-size-fits-all approach. Further investigation is needed to uncover these factors and develop more precise, individualized dosing algorithms to improve postthyroidectomy management. Future well-controlled and adequately sized prospective studies specifically designed to address this issue should take into account specific participant eligibility criteria including age, BMI, body composition, underlying thyroid disorders, concomitant therapies, causes of malabsorption, comorbidities, and patient compliance.

### Levothyroxine [^660b762f]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

Caution should be exercised when administering Levothyroxine Sodium Tablets, USP to patients with underlying cardiovascular disease, to the elderly, and to those with concomitant adrenal insufficiency (see PRECAUTIONS).

Specific Patient Populations:

Hypothyroidism in Adults and in Children in Whom Growth and Puberty are Complete (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests).

Therapy may begin at full replacement doses in otherwise healthy individuals less than 50 years old and in those older than 50 years who have been recently treated for hyperthyroidism or who have been hypothyroid for only a short time (such as a few months). The average full replacement dose of levothyroxine sodium is approximately 1.7 mcg/kg/day (e.g., 100–125 mcg/day for a 70 kg adult). Older patients may require less than 1 mcg/kg/day. Levothyroxine sodium doses greater than 200 mcg/day are seldom required. An inadequate response to daily doses ≥ 300 mcg/day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, and/or drug interactions.

For most patients older than 50 years or for patients under 50 years of age with underlying cardiac disease, an initial starting dose of 25–50 mcg/day of levothyroxine sodium is recommended, with gradual increments in dose at 6–8 week intervals, as needed. The recommended starting dose of levothyroxine sodium in elderly patients with cardiac disease is 12.5–25 mcg/day, with gradual dose increments at 4–6 week intervals. The levothyroxine sodium dose is generally adjusted in 12.5–25 mcg increments until the patient with primary hypothyroidism is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH has normalized.

Intervention

The investigational medicinal products are levothyroxine sodium (T4) as 25 or 50 microgram tablets for oral administration and a matching placebo. All tablets are white and round in shape with the strength imprinted, identically packaged in blisters and packed in plain cardboard cartons to maintain study blinding. Participants are advised to take the suggested dose of study medication once daily half an hour before breakfast.

The intervention group will start with levothyroxine 50 micrograms daily (25 micrograms in participants with < 50 kg body weight or with a history of coronary heart disease) and the control group with matching placebo for six to 8 weeks.

After 6–8 weeks a venous blood sample is taken for TSH assessment. Based on the TSH results, the data centre advises the new dose of study medication or placebo to the clinical investigators.
If TSH < 0.4 mU/L: the treatment dose is reduced to 25 micrograms levothyroxine in those starting on 50 micrograms; reduced to 0 in those starting on 25 micrograms – effected by giving placebo matching the 25 micrograms dose. These participants will have a further TSH check after 6–8 weeks. If TSH remains < 0.4 mU/L participant will be withdrawn from randomised treatment and referred to usual care.
If TSH ≥ 0.4 and < 4.6 mU/L: no change to the treatment dose.
If TSH remains elevated (≥ 4.6 mU/L): 25 micrograms of levothyroxine will be added. Giving a total daily dose of 75 micrograms levothyroxine for those starting on 50 micrograms, or a total daily dose of 50 micrograms levothyroxine for those starting on 25 micrograms.

### The starting dose of levothyroxine in primary hypothyroidism treatment… [^797fa9d9]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Although the treatment of hypothyroidism with levothyroxine, one of the most commonly prescribed drugs, seems effective and simple, recommendations for the starting dose of levothyroxine vary considerably: from 50 μg to a full replacement dose of 1. 6 or

1. 7 μg/kg in healthy adult patients younger than 65 years and from 25 to 50 μg/d in older patients and patients with known ischemic heart disease. 8–13 The safety and efficacy of different initial doses of levothyroxine have, to our knowledge, never been studied prospectively. Patients were randomly assigned to either a high starting levothyroxine dose of 1. 6 μg/kg or a low dose of 25 μg. Randomization was stratified according to serum thyrotropin level below or above 50 mIU/L.

During treatment, the levothyroxine dosage of each patient was initially adjusted with increments of 25 μg every 4 weeks and from 24 weeks onward every 12 weeks according to serum thyrotropin and FT4 levels, with serum thyrotropin and FT4 levels within the normal reference range as a target of treatment. The levothyroxine dose in the full-dose group was increased slightly from a mean of 128 μg at baseline to a mean of 139 μg at 48 weeks; in the low-dose group, the dose was increased until 16 weeks of treatment, after which it remained unchanged, with a mean of 110 μg. Since we did not observe any cardiac adverse events, we believe that it is safe to treat patients with hypothyroidism with a full replacement dose of levothyroxine if they have no history of ischemic heart disease.

Such a treatment strategy is more practical and convenient for the patients and will make outpatient control more cost-effective. Our study supports the recommendation of a full replacement starting dose of levothyroxine of 1. 6 μg/kg in healthy adult patients younger than 65 years. 9 Moreover, our study also provides evidence that it is safe to treat patients older than 65 years with hypothyroidism with a full replacement dose of levothyroxine if they have no history of ischemic heart disease.

Hospitalized but not critically ill patients — formulation and route for levothyroxine: For these patients, oral levothyroxine treatment is recommended; if this is not feasible, other enteral routes can be used, and if there are concerns about significant malabsorption or other clinical reasons precluding enteral dosing, intravenous levothyroxine may be administered until enteral absorption improves, using an equivalent intravenous dose of approximately 75%, assuming the enteral levothyroxine dose had achieved euthyroidism. Weak recommendation. Low-quality evidence.

ATA/AACE hypothyroidism — initial L‑thyroxine dosing: With initial thyroid hormone replacement, replacement therapy requires approximately 1.6 μg/kg of L‑thyroxine daily; patients who are athyreotic and those with central hypothyroidism may require higher doses, while patients with subclinical hypothyroidism or after treatment for Graves' disease may require less. In subclinical hypothyroidism, doses of 25–75 μg daily are usually sufficient for achieving euthyroid levels. One randomized controlled trial assigned starting doses by baseline thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) as 25 μg for TSH 4.0–8.0 mIU/L, 50 μg for TSH 8–12 mIU/L, and 75 μg for TSH > 12 mIU/L, and after 2 months only minimal further adjustments were required to achieve euthyroidism.

Levothyroxine product selection — prescription of brand name levothyroxine, or alternatively maintenance of the same generic preparation (i.e., maintenance of an identifiable formulation of levothyroxine), is advised. Switches between levothyroxine products could potentially result in variations in the administered dose and should generally be avoided for that reason (see also recommendation 3d). Weak recommendation. Low-quality evidence (for general populations). Strong recommendation. Low-quality evidence (frail patients, high-risk thyroid cancer patients, pregnant patients).

American Thyroid Association guideline — levothyroxine (LT4) dose requirements and modifiers are summarized as follows: Based on body weight, hypothyroid patients with minimal endogenous thyroid function require LT4 doses of 1.6–1.8 µg/kg of actual body weight, with some studies estimating 2.0–2.1 µg/kg for some patient groups, and LT4 doses in thyroid cancer patients requiring thyrotropin (TSH) suppression are on the order of 2.1–2.7 µg/kg. Ideal body weight is reported as a better predictor of LT4 dose than actual body weight, women treated for hypothyroidism typically require an increase in LT4 dose early in the first trimester of pregnancy, and LT4 replacement doses tend to decrease with age when titrated based on serum TSH; the presence of the type 2 deiodinase gene (DIO2) Thr92Ala polymorphism has produced inconsistent findings.

3.2 Comparison Between the Low and High Initial Levothyroxine Dose Groups

Table 2 summarises clinical characteristics and the results of comparative analyses between 'Low' and 'High' initial Levothyroxine dose groups. The birth history was relatively even in both groups with p values of 0.738 for the GA and 0.503 for the BW z ‐score. The 'Low' group was initially prescribed Levothyroxine of 7.41 ± 1.47 mcg/kg, while the 'High' group used 12.07 ± 1.78 mcg/kg (p < 0.001). Children in the 'Low' group had more favourable pretreatment thyroid functions (fT4 1.08 ± 0.27 and TSH 26.95 ± 19.80) compared to that of the 'High' group (fT4 0.80 ± 0.42 and TSH 100.44 ± 191.29) with statistical significance (p < 0.001 and p = 0.004, respectively). Thus, the treatment initiation was comparably faster in the 'High' group (22.82 ± 7.16) than in the 'Low' group (30.8 ± 17.77, p < 0.001), which likely reflects clinicians' tendency to initiate therapy more promptly in infants presenting with more severe thyroid dysfunction at diagnosis.

### Establishing the adequate levothyroxine dose after total thyroidectomy: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^f99d7a3d]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

All studies were conducted in referral hospital centers. The normal TSH range was reported by all studies, with most using 0.4 to 4.5, while only 1 study applied a 0.4 to 2.5 range. For tumors, different risk categories were considered: low risk (0.5–2), intermediate risk (0.1–0.5), and high risk (< 0.1). Of the 11 studies included, 7 analyzed patients using a single LT4 dosing method: 2 studies used a dose/kg approach, 3 applied a fixed-dose regimen, and 2 employed an algorithm-based method. In the remaining 4 studies, multiple groups of patients received different dosing strategies: 3 compared 2 groups (1 using a dose/kg method and the other an algorithm-based approach) and 1 examined 4 groups using a dose/kg method but with a different TSH target according to their disease.

As a result, the 11 studies yielded 17 patient groups. Among them, 3 groups followed a fixed-dose regimen [2 receiving 100 mcg, 1 receiving 150 mcg], 9 groups used a dose/kg approach, and 5 groups applied an algorithm-based calculation.

A detailed description of the algorithm-based approaches is reported in Supplemental Material 3.

All studies reported the number of euthyroid patients at the first control, which was typically conducted at 6 to 8 weeks, with the widest timeframe being 4 to 15 weeks.

Quantitative Analysis (Meta-analysis)

The pooled proportion of patients achieving target thyroid hormone levels at the first postthyroidectomy follow-up was 33.9% (803/2577 patients), with a confidence interval from 29.3% to 38.5% (Fig. 2). The analysis included 17 different study populations, demonstrating substantial heterogeneity (I 2 = 82.68%). A comparative analysis based on key study characteristics was performed to explore potential sources of heterogeneity (Table 2).

### Levothyroxine sodium (levothroid) [^198c6c6d]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism in Adults and in Children in Whom Growth and Puberty are Complete (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests)

Therapy may begin at full replacement doses in otherwise healthy individuals less than 50 years old and in those older than 50 years who have been recently treated for hyperthyroidism or who have been hypothyroid for only a short time (such as a few months). The average full replacement dose of levothyroxine sodium is approximately 1.7 mcg/kg/day (e.g., 100–125 mcg/day for a 70 kg adult). Older patients may require less than 1 mcg/kg/day. Levothyroxine sodium doses greater than 200 mcg/day are seldom required. An inadequate response to daily doses ≥ 300 mcg/day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, and/or drug interactions.

For most patients older than 50 years or for patients under 50 years of age with underlying cardiac disease, an initial starting dose of 25–50 mcg/day of levothyroxine sodium is recommended, with gradual increments in dose at 6–8 week intervals, as needed. The recommended starting dose of levothyroxine sodium in elderly patients with cardiac disease is 12.5–25 mcg/day, with gradual dose increments at 4–6 week intervals. The levothyroxine sodium dose is generally adjusted in 12.5–25 mcg increments until the patient with primary hypothyroidism is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH has normalized.

In patients with severe hypothyroidism, the recommended initial levothyroxine sodium dose is 12.5–25 mcg/day with increases of 25 mcg/day every 2–4 weeks, accompanied by clinical and laboratory assessment, until the TSH level is normalized.

In patients with secondary (pituitary) or tertiary (hypothalamic) hypothyroidism, the levothyroxine sodium dose should be titrated until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum free-T4level is restored to the upper half of the normal range.

### Establishing the adequate levothyroxine dose after total thyroidectomy: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^a03cf760]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Total thyroidectomy requires lifelong replacement therapy with levothyroxine (LT4). Achieving optimal thyroid hormones replacement promptly after surgery is important but somehow challenging. Indeed, previous studies addressing this topic clearly indicate that a significant proportion of patients who are started on LT4 therapy for postthyroidectomy hypothyroidism require multiple dose adjustments over time. The clinical scenario is thus how we should choose the starting LT4 dose in patients just after total thyroidectomy to warrant the highest rate of euthyroidism at the first postsurgery evaluation. While initial investigations used fixed LT4 doses, revised and eventually adjusted at early follow-up, more recent studies propose potential tailored approaches to more precisely estimate the optimal LT4 dose. Current clinical guidelines on the treatment of primary hypothyroidism recommend that when choosing a starting dose of LT4, several factors including patient's weight, lean body mass, etiology of hypothyroidism, degree of thyrotropin elevation, age, and comorbidities (ie, particularly cardiac diseases) should all be taken into account. Most papers suggest that in athyreotic patients, a starting LT4 dose of 1.6 to 1.8 mcg/kg of body weight would be adequate, even though other authors have advocated for a higher starting dose of 2.0 to 2.1 mcg/kg, at least in selected settings.

There is general agreement that the etiology sustaining hypothyroidism impacts on the optimal LT4 dose, making athyreotic patients, owing to the lack of residual functional thyroid tissue, more likely to require a higher LT4 dose as compared to patients with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. Furthermore, the therapeutic target of TSH may vary in relation to the underlying condition, such as in patients with thyroid cancer who may require higher LT4 doses (ie, TSH-suppressive therapy). In addition, from the patient's standpoint, promptly achieving euthyroidism can provide clinical benefits in terms of both well-being and reduction of further clinical consultations. Although the number of studies in this field is significant, no clear and solid information is available about the optimal LT4 starting dose to be used in athyreotic subjects with no (or at least minor) need for further adjustment over time.

Levothyroxine (LT4) bioequivalence — FDA criteria and clinical assessment: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines an LT4 formulation as equivalent if the 90% confidence interval of the difference of the pharmacokinetically derived areas under the curve (AUC) and difference of maximal concentrations (Cmax) of serum T4 fall within 80%–125% of a reference product when a comparable dose is administered to healthy volunteers, and in this analysis the LT4 dose is only tested at a single oral dose of 600 μg. The guideline states this definition is problematic because it does not require assessment of serum TSH and because 600 μg is pharmacologic, and proposes assessing comparable serum T4, T3, and TSH after daily dosing for at least 4–6 weeks in athyroid individuals; simulation studies also support TSH-based protocols for judging bioequivalence rather than pharmacokinetic indices.

### Thyroid hormone therapy for older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism [^75e630b7]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

The use of levothyroxine to treat subclinical hypothyroidism is controversial. We aimed to determine whether levothyroxine provided clinical benefits in older persons with this condition.

Methods

We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial involving 737 adults who were at least 65 years of age and who had persisting subclinical hypothyroidism (thyrotropin level, 4.60 to 19.99 mIU per liter; free thyroxine level within the reference range). A total of 368 patients were assigned to receive levothyroxine (at a starting dose of 50 μg daily, or 25 μg if the body weight was < 50 kg or the patient had coronary heart disease), with dose adjustment according to the thyrotropin level; 369 patients were assigned to receive placebo with mock dose adjustment. The two primary outcomes were the change in the Hypothyroid Symptoms score and Tiredness score on a thyroid-related quality-of-life questionnaire at 1 year (range of each scale is 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more symptoms or tiredness, respectively; minimum clinically important difference, 9 points).

Results

The mean age of the patients was 74.4 years, and 396 patients (53.7%) were women. The mean (± SD) thyrotropin level was 6.40 ± 2.01 mIU per liter at baseline; at 1 year, this level had decreased to 5.48 mIU per liter in the placebo group, as compared with 3.63 mIU per liter in the levothyroxine group (P < 0.001), at a median dose of 50 μg. We found no differences in the mean change at 1 year in the Hypothyroid Symptoms score (0.2 ± 15.3 in the placebo group and 0.2 ± 14.4 in the levothyroxine group; between-group difference, 0.0; 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.0 to 2.1) or the Tiredness score (3.2 ± 17.7 and 3.8 ± 18.4, respectively; between-group difference, 0.4; 95% CI, -2.1 to 2.9). No beneficial effects of levothyroxine were seen on secondary-outcome measures. There was no significant excess of serious adverse events prespecified as being of special interest.

Conclusions

Levothyroxine provided no apparent benefits in older persons with subclinical hypothyroidism. (Funded by European Union FP7 and others; TRUST ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01660126 .).

### Study protocol: a randomised controlled trial on the clinical effects of levothyroxine treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism in people aged 80 years and over… [^aa9f8dd5]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

A maximum of two levothyroxine up-titrations at the start of the trial and one up-titration at 12 and 24 month (± 1 month) intervals with repeated TSH measurements after 6–8 weeks ensure adequate levothyroxine treatment while avoiding potential over-replacement. The maximum possible dose of levothyroxine is 150 micrograms.

A mock titration adopting an adaptive schedule is performed in the placebo group by the data centre. A similar proportion of placebo patients will have up and down titrations of study medication as the intervention group to ensure the number of tablets and assessments is similar in both groups.

Because all thyroid function measurements are available only to the data centre, the clinical investigators remain fully blinded to the treatment allocation process during the trial.

Accountability logs recording the quantities of study medication dispensed to and returned from study participants, batch numbers and expiry dates are available for all study drug movements.

Criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated study medication:
If overt biochemical hypothyroidism is identified (TSH > 20 mU/L and/or fT4 below the reference range) a second TSH with fT4 within 2 weeks is requested. Upon confirmation of biochemical hypothyroidism the participant will be withdrawn from the study treatment and referred to the General Practitioner (GP) for usual care.
If overt biochemical hyperthyroidism is identified (TSH < 0.4 mU/L) in the placebo group, or consecutively in the treatment group despite downtitrations, the participant will be withdrawn from the study treatment and referred to the GP for usual care.
If for clinical reasons (e.g. major illness) a proposed change in study medication or placebo is deemed inappropriate the algorithm is overridden by the local principal coordinator and no change in study medication takes place.

Randomisation

Participants are randomised to either the levothyroxine or placebo treatment arm (ratio 1:1) using the randomly permuted block method, stratified by site, sex and starting dose. The data centre (Robertson Centre for Biostatistics, University of Glasgow, Scotland) independently provides the randomisation schedule. Mawdsley Brooks & Co. implements the schedule through identical packaging of levothyroxine and matching placebo tablets.

Patient allocation is conducted via the dedicated trial web portal by the study nurses. When a participant is eligible based on entering the eligibility criteria in an electronic case report form (eCRF) supervised by a medically certified Principle Investigator, a central computer will trigger the decision.

Levothyroxine dosing frequency and adherence — once-weekly and twice-weekly regimens: A randomized cross-over trial of once weekly oral administration of 7 times the usual daily levothyroxine (LT4) dose versus daily dosing found weekly therapy produced supratherapeutic T4 for about 24 hours while T3 remained within the reference range, and over 6 weeks other biochemical and clinical markers, including patient symptoms, did not differ from daily therapy. A second similar 6-week cross-over trial showed greater increases in T4 after weekly dosing than daily dosing without symptoms or echocardiographic evidence of hyperthyroidism. For patients in whom daily LT4 intake is unsuccessful, options include observed therapy or reducing the frequency of LT4 ingestion to twice weekly or weekly with a starting dose equal to the weight‑adjusted daily regimen (i.e., 7 times the daily dose); parenteral LT4 is also possible, although no trials were identified.

Levothyroxine administration timing with meals and beverages — recommendation and absorption effects: Because co‑administration of food and levothyroxine is likely to impair levothyroxine absorption, we recommend that, if possible, levothyroxine be consistently taken either 60 minutes before breakfast or at bedtime (3 or more hours after the evening meal) for optimal, consistent absorption. Weak recommendation. Moderate quality of evidence. Under optimum fasting conditions, the absorption of an orally administered dose of LT4 is about 70%–80%, and if oral medications cannot be taken the appropriate intravenous dose is approximately 75% of the oral dose. When LT4 is co‑administered with food, absorption is reduced; in one study in healthy volunteers, LT4 absorption with food was 64% compared with 80% in the fasting state.

Newborns

The recommended starting dose of levothyroxine sodium in newborn infants is 10–15 mcg/kg/day. A lower starting dose (e.g., 25 mcg/day) should be considered in infants at risk for cardiac failure, and the dose should be increased in 4–6 weeks as needed based on clinical and laboratory response to treatment. In infants with very low (< 5 mcg/dL) or undetectable serum T4 concentrations, the recommended initial starting dose is 50 mcg/day of levothyroxine sodium.

Infants and Children

Levothyroxine therapy is usually initiated at full replacement doses, with the recommended dose per body weight decreasing with age (see TABLE 3). However, in children with chronic or severe hypothyroidism, an initial dose of 25 mcg/day of levothyroxine sodium is recommended with increments of 25 mcg every 2–4 weeks until the desired effect is achieved.

Hyperactivity in an older child can be minimized if the starting dose is one-fourth of the recommended full replacement dose, and the dose is then increased on a weekly basis by an amount equal to one-fourth the full-recommended replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reached.

### Establishing the adequate levothyroxine dose after total thyroidectomy: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^afbaf567]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Total thyroidectomy requires lifelong levothyroxine (LT4) therapy. Achieving optimal thyroid hormone replacement at the first postoperative follow-up might be harder than expected. Despite the various LT4 dose-choosing strategies tested, there is no consensus on the most effective approach to achieve early euthyroidism.

Materials and Methods

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis, including studies published between 2000 and 2024 that reported the proportion of patients achieving euthyroidism at first follow-up after total thyroidectomy. Data from 11 studies comprising 2577 patients were analyzed. LT4 dosing strategies included fixed-dose, weight-based (dose/kg), and individualized algorithm-based methods. Meta-regression and subgroup analyses were used to explore sources of heterogeneity.

Results

The pooled euthyroidism rate at first follow-up was 33.9%, with high heterogeneity across studies (I 2 = 82.68%). No dosing strategy consistently outperformed others: dose/kg methods achieved 29% euthyroidism, while fixed or algorithm-based approaches achieved 40%, though without statistical significance. Meta-regression analysis did not identify any statistically significant predictor. No significant differences emerged between patients treated for benign or malignant thyroid diseases or between retrospective and prospective study designs.

Conclusion

Only about one-third of patients achieve euthyroidism at first follow-up after thyroidectomy, regardless of LT4 dosing strategy. The current guidelines recommendation of applying a pro/kg dose may not be adequate, and even personalized algorithms yield inconsistent results. Future prospective studies are needed to refine individualized dosing protocols and identify additional factors influencing LT4 requirements.

### Adequate levothyroxine doses for the treatment of hypothyroidism newly discovered during pregnancy [^f87d0e2f]. Thyroid (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Recent guidelines recommend thyrotropin (TSH) target levels of ≤ 2.5mIU/L for the first trimester and ≤ 3mIU/L for the subsequent trimesters. Euthyroidism should be attained as soon as possible, but there are no precise indications about the initial levothyrorine (LT4) dose. The aim of our study was to determine the appropriate LT4 doses in order to normalize TSH levels in patients with newly discovered subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) during pregnancy, and to correlate them with basal TSH levels. The adequate LT4 doses for women with SCH were also compared to those required in pregnant women with overt hypothyroidism (OH).

Methods

Seventy-seven patients with newly diagnosed hypothyroidism during pregnancy were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were assigned to group 1 (n = 64) with SCH or group 2 (n = 13) with OH. SCH patients were subdivided into two groups: group 1a serum TSH > 2.5 (1st trimester) or > 3 (2nd or 3rd trimester) to 4.2mIU/L; and group 1b TSH level > 4.21-10mIU/L. All patients were treated with LT4 as soon as hypothyroidism was diagnosed. The dose that allowed a TSH of ≤ 2.5mIU/L to be reached in the first trimester or one that allowed a TSH of ≤ 3mIU/L to be reached during the second and third trimesters was considered the appropriate one.

Results

A significant difference (p < 0.0001) in the appropriate LT4 dose (mean ± SD,μg/kg/day) was observed between group 1 and group 2: 1.31 ± 0.36 versus 2.33 ± 0.59. Patients in group 1a required a significantly lower LT4 dose (p < 0.014) than group1b: 1.20 ± 0.39 versus 1.42 ± 0.31μg/kg/day. In 57 of the 64 (89.06%) women with SCH and in 10/13 (76.92%) women with OH, the appropriate LT4 dose coincided with the initial dose. Only 11% and 23% respectively required additional adjustments. Once the appropriate dose of LT4 was prescribed, the time at which euthyroidism (mean ± SD, weeks) was confirmed was similar in patients with SCH (6.06 ± 3.3) and OH (5.3 ± 1.8). There were no miscarriages or premature deliveries.

Conclusions

When hypothyroidism is newly discovered during pregnancy, we suggest initiating the treatment with the following LT4 doses: 1.20μg/kg/day for SCH with TSH ≤ 4.2 mIU/L, 1.42 μg/kg/day with TSH > 4.2–10, and 2.33μg/kg/day for OH. By taking this approach, patients will promptly attain the euthyroid state avoiding additional increments and, probably, obstetric risks.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^07a7b05d]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Levothyroxine dosing and monitoring — primary hypothyroidism: Except in secondary (central) hypothyroidism, dose titration is guided by serum thyrotropin (TSH), with the "target TSH typically being 0.5 to 3.5 or 4 mIU/L". "Dose adjustments are usually made 4–6 weeks after initiating therapy", typically in increments of "12.5–25 μg/d", and "the serum TSH is then repeated in 4–6 weeks, until the TSH target has been reached". Ongoing monitoring is advised as "serum TSH should be measured in 4–6 months and then at 12 months to assure stability". In patients with coronary artery disease, initiation should be conservative: "Patients with known coronary artery disease (CAD) should always be started on a low LT4 dose (12.5–25 μg/d), with gradual increases based on symptoms and serum TSH levels".

### Establishing the adequate levothyroxine dose after total thyroidectomy: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^b9d11fb9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Total thyroidectomy requires lifelong levothyroxine (LT4) therapy. Achieving optimal thyroid hormone replacement at the first post-operative follow-up might be harder than it could be expected. Despite various LT4 dose choosing strategies were tested, there is no consensus on the most effective approach to achieve early euthyroidism.

Materials and Methods

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis, including studies published between 2000 and 2024 that reported the proportion of patients achieving euthyroidism at first follow-up after total thyroidectomy. Data from 11 studies comprising 2577 patients were analyzed. LT4 dosing strategies included fixed-dose, weight-based (dose/kg), and individualized algorithm-based methods. Meta-regression and subgroup analyses were used to explore sources of heterogeneity.

Results

The pooled euthyroidism rate at first follow-up was 33.9%, with high heterogeneity across studies (I² = 82.68%). No dosing strategy consistently outperformed others: dose/kg methods achieved 29% euthyroidism, while fixed or algorithm-based approaches achieved 40%, though without statistical significance. Meta-regression analysis did not identify any statistically significant predictor. No significant differences emerged between patients treated for benign or malignant thyroid diseases or between retrospective and prospective study designs.

Conclusions

Only about one-third of patients achieve euthyroidism at first follow-up after thyroidectomy, regardless of LT4 dosing strategy. The current guidelines recommendation of applying a pro/kg dose may not be adequate, and even personalized algorithms yield inconsistent results. Future prospective studies are needed to refine individualized dosing protocols and identify additional factors influencing LT4 requirements.

### Congenital hypothyroidism: long-term growth and intellectual outcomes with a lower initial levothyroxine dose [^2dd60304]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

Although higher initial doses of Levothyroxine have been recommended to for better outcomes, the average initial dose in our cohort was slightly lower, at 9.35 mcg/kg. This was primarily attributable to limited tablet formulations available during the early study period and the increased detection of TCH following widespread newborn screening. Notably, the higher dose group had significantly lower pretreatment fT4, higher TSH, and earlier treatment initiation, suggesting that dose selection was guided by initial disease severity. However, after adjusting for these covariates, the initial dose was not independently associated with growth or IQ outcomes.

Recent discussions have questioned whether high initial doses are always necessary. We found that children who received lower initial dose still showed good long‐term outcomes, and the differences between two initial dose groups were consistently small (Cohen's d < 0.5 for all outcomes). These results aligned with the report by Andrea E. et al, who reported comparable outcomes with initial dose of 10−12.5 mcg/kg versus 12.5−15 mcg/kg. Higher doses have been associated with an increased risk of overtreatment, which in some studies has been reported to be associated with attention‐deficit hypersensitivity disorder (ADHD) and other potential neurologic sequelae. In our cohort, three patients with confirmed ADHD were identified, though the variability in their initial doses (5.0, 13.16, and 15.96 mcg/kg) and the lack of structured ADHD screening prevent any conclusive association. Nevertheless, our results support a cautious, individualised approach to dose selection, balancing early efficacy with potential overtreatment concerns. While our retrospective findings do not establish non‐inferiority, it demonstrates no apparent disadvantage to lower initial dosing.

Dosage and Adminitration

General Principles:

The goal of replacement therapy is to achieve and maintain a clinical and biochemical euthyroid state. The goal of suppressive therapy is to inhibit growth and/or function of abnormal thyroid tissue. The dose of Levothyroxine Sodium Tablets, USP that is adequate to achieve these goals depends on a variety of factors including the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions, including pregnancy, concomitant medications, and the specific nature of the condition being treated (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS). Hence, the following recommendations serve only as dosing guidelines. Dosing must be individualized and adjustments made based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters (see PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests).

Levothyroxine Sodium Tablets, USP should be taken in the morning on an empty stomach, at least one-half hour to one hour before any food is eaten. Levothyroxine Sodium Tablets, USP should be taken at least 4 hours apart from drugs that are known to interfere with its absorption (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).

Due to the long half-life of levothyroxine, the peak therapeutic effect at a given dose of levothyroxine sodium may not be attained for 4–6 weeks.

"Autoimmune thyroiditis is the most common cause of acquired hypothyroidism; it is more common in females compared to males, and the incidence increases during adolescence". Severe cases may present with "TSH values > 1000 mIU/L". For OHI, "LT4 replacement therapy is the treatment of choice for patients with OHI with the dose adjusted for weight or body surface area", using age bands where "The LT4 dose for patients 1–3 years of age is 4–6 μg/kg/d, for patients 3–10 years the LT4 dose is 3–5 μg/kg/d, and for patients 10–16 years the LT4 dose is 2–4 μg/kg/d", and "LT4 may also be dosed based on body surface area calculated at 100 μg/m2/d". Expectations should be realistic because "Reduction in pretreatment weight should not be presumed with initiation of LT4 replacement therapy".

### Levothyroxine sodium (Levo-T) [^7cd5a384]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary Hypothyroidism in Adults and in Adolescents in Whom Growth and Puberty are Complete

Start LEVO-T at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non-elderly individuals who have been hypothyroid for only a short time (such as a few months). The average full replacement dose of LEVO-T is approximately 1.6 mcg per kg per day (for example: 100 to 125 mcg per day for a 70 kg adult).

Adjust the dose by 12.5 to 25 mcg increments every 4 to 6 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. Doses greater than 200 mcg per day are seldom required. An inadequate response to daily doses of greater than 300 mcg per day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors.

For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with a dose of 12.5 to 25 mcg per day. Increase the dose every 6 to 8 weeks, as needed until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. The full replacement dose of LEVO-T may be less than 1 mcg per kg per day in elderly patients.

In patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism, start with a dose of 12.5 to 25 mcg per day. Adjust the dose in 12.5 to 25 mcg increments every 2 to 4 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH level is normalized.

Secondary or Tertiary Hypothyroidism

Start LEVO-T at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non-elderly individuals. Start with a lower dose in elderly patients, patients with underlying cardiovascular disease or patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism as described above. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of LEVO-T dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum free-T4 level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Titrate LEVO-T dosing per above instructions until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum free-T4 level is restored to the upper half of the normal range.

### Levothyroxine starting dose in primary hypothyroid treatment… [^057c9e68]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Primary hypothyroidism is a common medical disorder that usually presents secondary to autoimmune thyroiditis. Symptoms of hypothyroidism include fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, and constipation. Treatment of hypothyroidism with levothyroxine is effective, but starting doses vary. There are two strategies for initiating levothyroxine in healthy adults younger than 65 years: low-dose and full-dose. Traditionally, lower starting doses of 25 to 50 mcg per day are recommended for patients 65 years and older or who have ischemic heart disease. Low-dose initiation of thyroid supplementation usually takes four to six months before plasma thyrotropin and free thyroxine levels become normal. Roos and associates compared the full starting dose of levothyroxine with the low dose in individuals with primary hypothyroidism without known cardiac disease. Patients were excluded if they had a history of cardiac disease or were taking cardiac medication.

Patients were randomly assigned to receive a starting levothyroxine dosage of 25 mcg per day or 1. 6 mcg per kg per day. Levothyroxine doses were adjusted by 25 mcg every four weeks until 24 weeks. Doses then were adjusted every 12 weeks with the goal of maintaining serum thyrotropin and FT. Twenty-five patients were randomly assigned to the low-dose group and 25 to the high-dose group. The two groups were similar in severity of hypothyroidism and age. At week four, 13 patients reached euthyroid levels in the high-dose group compared with one in the low-dose group. This trend persisted until week 24, when 21 in the high-dose group and 20 in the low-dose group met the criteria for being euthyroid. The rate of change in clinical scores and quality of life were similar between the two groups. Body weight, heart rate, and blood pressure were unchanged in both groups. There were no palpitations, angina pectoris, or other cardiac events documented in either group.

The authors conclude that starting healthy primary hypothyroid patients on a full dose of levothyroxine is safe and effective for those who do not have a history of cardiac disease. They add that this strategy may be more convenient and cost effective than the method of starting low and titrating slowly.

### Congenital hypothyroidism: long-term growth and intellectual outcomes with a lower initial levothyroxine dose [^65849e5b]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is known as the most common cause of preventable neurodevelopmental dysfunction in neonates. If not treated, CH children experience severe growth retardation and developmental delay. Since the 1950s, Levothyroxine, a synthetic form of thyroid hormone, has been established as the standard treatment to normalise thyroid hormone levels and prevent morbidities in children with CH.

Most centres follow the guidelines on CH suggested by the American Academy of Paediatrics (AAP), emphasising the importance of early screening and adequate treatment with Levothyroxine. Constant updates in the guidelines, especially according to the recently updated version by the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology, also recommend commencing the treatment as soon as the CH is diagnosed, with an initial daily dose of Levothyroxine from 10 to 15 mcg/kg. Earlier studies reported concerns regarding early overtreatment, suggesting potential long‐term neurocognitive adverse effects such as ADHD and metabolic consequences. There also is a trend toward reconsidering the Levothyroxine dose with some studies suggesting that lower doses may be sufficient in the treatment of CH. Laura Niuro et al. even claimed that 2‐year growth outcomes among 6.8, 7.4, and 10.8 mcg/kg Levothyroxine dose groups all fall within normal ranges. Similarly, Shan He et al. recommended tailoring the initial dose based on pretreatment TSH levels, suggesting that CH children with milder biochemical abnormalities may not require higher doses.

Despite these discussions, a long‐term study evaluating growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes of CH children initially treated with a lower Levothyroxine dose is scarce. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the long‐term growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes of children with CH, focusing on the influence of a lower initial dose of Levothyroxine compared to current recommendations.

### No effect of levothyroxine on hemoglobin in older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism: pooled results from 2 randomized controlled trials [^374de839]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

The current preplanned combined analysis uses data from the TRUST (Thyroid hormone Replacement for Untreated older adults with Subclinical hypothyroidism Trial) trial and the IEMO 80-plus Thyroid trial. Both trials were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group trials investigating the potential multimodal effects of levothyroxine treatment for persons with subclinical hypothyroidism aged 65 years and older, and aged 80 years and older, respectively. The identical design, study processes, and infrastructure allowed for a preplanned combined analysis. Consequently, the combined cohorts are presented and analyzed as a single study group throughout the manuscript.

The full study protocols and statistical analysis plans for the TRUST Thyroid trial and the IEMO 80-plus Thyroid trial have been published previously. In short, persons aged 65 years and older (TRUST Thyroid trial) or 80 years and older (IEMO 80-plus Thyroid trial) with a diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism, defined as elevated thyrotropin (thyroid stimulating hormone; TSH) levels (≥ 4.6 and ≤ 19.9 mIU/L), measured on at least 2 occasions with an interval between > 3 months and 3 years apart, and free thyroxine (fT4) within normal local laboratory ranges, were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included, but were not limited to, the use of levothyroxine, antithyroid medication, clinical diagnosis of dementia, recent hospitalization for major illness, and terminal illness. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to levothyroxine or placebo.

The study medication consisted of levothyroxine sodium tablets and matching placebo tablets taken orally daily. The intervention group started with 50 micrograms daily (or 25 micrograms for participants with body weight < 50 kg or a history of coronary heart disease) and the control group with a matching placebo for 6 to 8 weeks. Two optional up- or down-titrations after 6- to 8-week intervals, and one at 12 months of follow-up ensured adequate treatment while avoiding potential overtreatment, mirroring routine clinical practice. An adaptive mock titration schedule was applied for the placebo group. Participants, general practitioners (GPs) and study personnel remained blinded to treatment allocation and thyroid function test results throughout the study. Ethics approval was obtained from the medical ethics committees and competent authorities in the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Ireland. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

3 Results

3.1 Characteristics of the Study Population

The baseline characteristics of 144 study subjects are presented in Table 1. The study population's mean GA was 38.88 ± 1.62 weeks, and their average BW was 3.20 ± 0.52 kg. Levothyroxine therapy was initiated when they were 27 ± 15 days old, reflecting variability in timing of referral and confirmatory diagnostic processes, with a dose of 9.35 ± 2.80 mcg/kg. Serum fT4 and TSH levels before the Levothyroxine therapy were 0.96 ± 0.37 ng/dL and 58.0 ± 129 μIU/mL, respectively. Thirty‐five (24%) of the study population failed the discontinuation trial and were treated with Levothyroxine to date. According to the thyroid ultrasonography and scintigraphy, the majority of subjects (78.5%) showed normally located and morphologically normal thyroid glands. One subject (0.7%) exhibited an intrathyroidal thymus, which was not considered a thyroid anomaly. These cases were interpreted as suggestive of dyshormonogenesis, although definitive diagnosis requires functional or genetic evaluation. In contrast, structural anomalies consistent with thyroid dysgenesis were identified in 30 subjects (20.8%), including ectopic thyroid (6.9%), hypoplasia (13.2%), and hemi‐agenesis (0.7%).

### Establishing the adequate levothyroxine dose after total thyroidectomy: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^32fb980c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

As millions of people around the world take LT4 daily and a huge number of patients with goiter or cancer undergo thyroidectomy, achieving robust data about the optimal starting LT4 dose should be important for helping the clinical practice of thyroidologists. The main goal of the present meta-analysis was to assess whether different approaches for a LT4 dose-choosing strategy would translate into a higher number of euthyroid patients at the first follow-up visit after total thyroidectomy.

The results of the present analysis show a mean percentage of euthyroid patients receiving LT4 at the first follow-up after thyroidectomy of ∼34%. This indicates that, in most patients, independently from the LT4 dose-choosing method used, TSH level was either below or above the normal range. The high heterogeneity in terms of euthyroidism rates observed across studies (ranging from 19% to 68%) using different dose-choosing strategies highlights the complexity of choosing an adequate starting LT4 replacement dose in thyroidectomized patients. We aimed to identify the primary contributors to this variability, considering methodological differences in LT4 dosing and patient characteristics by assessing whether different methods for estimating LT4 dose would lead to different results in terms of rates of euthyroidism achieved.

The studies included in our analysis employed different dosing approaches, including fixed-dose regimens, weight-based dosing (dose/kg), and individualized algorithms incorporating factors such as BMI, lean body mass (LBM), or age. We conducted mainly 2 comparative analyses: (1) dose/kg studies vs all other approaches and (2) weight-based, BMI-based, LBM-based dosing vs fixed-dose and other particular algorithm-based methods. In both analyses, the second group exhibited higher rates of euthyroidism; however, this was accompanied by greater heterogeneity and wider confidence intervals, primarily due to 1 study belonging to the second group reporting a 68% achievement rate among 31 patients. When considering how these factors were incorporated into dose-choosing algorithms, we found that only 1 study included LBM in its algorithm, yet it achieved a euthyroidism rate of just 26%, indicating no clear advantage over other methods. No study accounted for sex in the dose-choosing algorithm. Two studies included age as a variable, reporting euthyroidism rates of 67% and 58%. Three studies incorporated BMI into their algorithms. Two studies considered age and BMI, while 1 used a BMI-based approach, achieving a euthyroidism rate of 38%.

### Levothyroxine replacement doses are affected by gender and weight, but not age [^d14b02f5]. Thyroid (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Body weight (BW) and age have been shown to affect the dose of levothyroxine (LT(4)) that results in normalization of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in hypothyroid patients. Our objective was to determine whether gender, menstrual status, and ideal BW (IBW) also affect the LT(4) dose required to achieve a serum TSH within the normal range.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients being treated for primary hypothyroidism who had TSH values within a normal range. We selected patients aged 18–85 years who were taking LT(4) without any confounding medications, and who had no serious chronic conditions. Their LT(4) doses, referred to here as LT(4) dose requirements, based on both BW and IBW were documented. The relationship between gender, menstrual status, age, serum TSH concentrations, and the degree of overweight on LT(4) dose requirements were determined using multivariate analyses.

Results

Women were significantly more overweight than men (ratio of BW/IBW was 1.35 for women vs. 1.17 for men, p < 0.0001). LT(4) requirements based on BW did not differ by gender when age was included in the model. However, when degree of overweight was also included, men required lower LT(4) doses than both premenopausal women (1.34 μg/kg vs. 1.51 μg/kg, p = 0.038) and menopausal women (1.34 μg/kg vs. 1.49 μg/kg, p = 0.023). When examining IBW using a model incorporating age, men also required lower LT(4) doses than both premenopausal women (1.64 μg/kg vs. 1.92μg/kg, p = 0.0033) and menopausal women (1.64 μg/kg vs. 1.90 μg/kg, p = 0.0024). Serum TSH concentrations were not significantly different in any of the gender groups. There was no relationship between serum TSH and either age or BW. The initial serum TSH concentration was by design with the normal range, but the concentration within that range was not a significant predictor of the LT(4) replacement dose in any of the models.

Conclusion

In contrast to previous studies suggesting that age affects LT(4) replacement requirements, we found that age-based differences in doses are secondary to differences in BW and gender. In addition, in contrast to prior studies showing that lean body mass, but not gender, affected LT(4) dose, we instead found a significant impact of gender. Gender-based differences in dose requirement only became apparent either when IBW was used to correct for the dose or when degree of overweight was included in the model. Gender differences in LT(4) dose requirement exist, but are masked unless gender-based differences in degree of overweight are also considered.

### Study protocol: a randomised controlled trial on the clinical effects of levothyroxine treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism in people aged 80 years and over… [^71e80bd1]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Subclinical hypothyroidism is common in older people and its contribution to health and disease needs to be elucidated further. Observational and clinical trial data on the clinical effects of subclinical hypothyroidism in persons aged 80 years and over is inconclusive, with some studies suggesting harm and some suggesting benefits, translating into equipoise whether levothyroxine therapy provides clinical benefits. This manuscript describes the study protocol for the Institute for Evidence-Based Medicine in Old Age (IEMO) 80-plus thyroid trial to generate the necessary evidence base.

Methods

The IEMO 80-plus thyroid trial was explicitly designed as an ancillary experiment to the Thyroid hormone Replacement for Untreated older adults with Subclinical hypothyroidism randomised placebo controlled Trial (TRUST) with a near identical protocol and shared research infrastructure. Outcomes will be presented separately for the IEMO and TRUST 80-plus groups, as well as a pre-planned combined analysis of the 145 participants included in the IEMO trial and the 146 participants from the TRUST thyroid trial aged 80 years and over.

The IEMO 80-plus thyroid trial is a multi-centre randomised double-blind placebo-controlled parallel group trial of levothyroxine treatment in community-dwelling participants aged 80 years and over with persistent subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH ≥ 4.6 and ≤ 19.9 mU/L and fT4 within laboratory reference ranges). Participants are randomised to levothyroxine 25 or 50 micrograms daily or matching placebo with dose titrations according to TSH levels, for a minimum follow-up of one and a maximum of three years.

Primary study endpoints: hypothyroid physical symptoms and tiredness on the thyroid-related quality of life patient-reported outcome (ThyPRO) at one year. Secondary endpoints: generic quality of life, executive cognitive function, handgrip strength, functional ability, blood pressure, weight, body mass index, and mortality. Adverse events will be recorded with specific interest on cardiovascular endpoints such as atrial fibrillation and heart failure.

Discussion

The combined analysis of participants in the IEMO 80-plus thyroid trial with the participants aged over 80 in the TRUST trial will provide the largest experimental evidence base on multimodal effects of levothyroxine treatment in 80-plus persons to date.

### Establishing the adequate levothyroxine dose after total thyroidectomy: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^f1bf2708]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

It is also important to note that there were studies we had to exclude from the analysis, such as those by Zaborek et al and Valenzuela et al, which proposed algorithms based on a retrospective analysis of their findings and hypothesized that these algorithms could bear favorable results. However, they examined a putative population without subsequent real-world testing.

Currently available literature data suggests that several patient-specific factors (ie, body weight, BMI, LBM, age, and sex) impact LT4 dose needs. However, the absence of a statistically significant association between BMI or age and target achievement in the meta-regression [Supplementary Material 4] highlights that BMI-based and age-based LT4 dosing alone is insufficient to warrant higher rates of euthyroidism, reinforcing the idea that multiple factors contribute to dosing variability. Furthermore, the present analysis included populations treated for both benign and malignant thyroid conditions. Although one might assume that different TSH targets could influence achievement rates, our analysis found no significant differences between patients treated for benign or malignant thyroid diseases, suggesting that even with lower TSH targets, achieving optimal levels remains challenging.

### Levothyroxine sodium (Euthyrox) [^5a6df355]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary Hypothyroidism in Adults and in Adolescents in Whom Growth and Puberty Are Complete

Start EUTHYROX at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non-elderly individuals who have been hypothyroid for only a short time (such as a few months). The average full replacement dose of EUTHYROX is approximately 1.6 mcg per kg per day (for example: 100 mcg per day to 125 mcg per day for a 70 kg adult).

Adjust the dose by 12.5 mcg to 25 mcg increments every 4 to 6 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. Doses greater than 200 mcg per day are seldom required. An inadequate response to daily doses of greater than 300 mcg per day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors.

For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with a dose of 12.5 mcg per day to 25 mcg per day. Increase the dose every 6 to 8 weeks, as needed until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. The full replacement dose of EUTHYROX may be less than 1 mcg per kg per day in elderly patients.

In patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism, start with a dose of 12.5 mcg per day to 25 mcg per day. Adjust the dose in 12.5 mcg to 25 mcg increments every 2 to 4 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH level is normalized.

Secondary or Tertiary Hypothyroidism

Start EUTHYROX at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non-elderly individuals. Start with a lower dose in elderly patients, patients with underlying cardiovascular disease or patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism as described above. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of EUTHYROX dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum free-T4 (L-thyroxine) level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Titrate EUTHYROX dosing per above instructions until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum free-T4 level is restored to the upper half of the normal range.

### Does initial dosing of levothyroxine in infants with congenital hypothyroidism lead to frequent dose adjustments secondary to iatrogenic hyperthyroidism on follow-up? [^a912134f]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is the most common preventable cause of intellectual disability. The recommended starting dose of levothyroxine (LT4) is between 10 and 15 μg/kg, an extremely wide range. We hypothesized that a sizable proportion of newborns treated for CH at the higher end of the dosage range become biochemically hyperthyroid at a follow-up visit.

Methods

This study is a retrospective chart review of infants with CH between 2002 and 2012.

Results

Of the 104 patients included in this analysis, the average age at diagnosis was 11 days and the average starting dose of LT4 was 12 ± 2.5 μg/kg. At follow-up, 36.5% required a dose reduction because of iatrogenic hyperthyroxinemia, 51% required no dose adjustment and 12.5% required a dose increase due to an elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). The starting doses of LT4 for those requiring a dose reduction, those not requiring an adjustment and those requiring an increase in the dose were 13.2 ± 2.4, 11.5 ± 2.1 and 10.3 ± 2.6 μg/kg/day, respectively (p ≤ 0.0001). Of the 34% of infants treated with an initial dose of > 12.5 μg/day, 57.1% required a dose reduction at follow-up, compared to 26.1% of those whose initial starting dose was ≤ 12.5 μg/kg/day (p = 0.007).

Conclusions

Following the guidelines for initiating therapy for CH, 36.5% of the infants required a dose reduction for iatrogenic hyperthyroxinemia. These infants received a higher dose of LT4 than the infants who either required no adjustment or required an increase in the dose. A narrower range for initial dosing in CH may be appropriate.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^8677ec58]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Combination levothyroxine/liothyronine (LT4/LT3) therapy versus levothyroxine (LT4) alone — randomized trials report variable TSH effects and largely neutral clinical outcomes. Table entries include a parallel, blinded study with 40 (33) over 15 weeks reporting "NS", a cross-over, blinded study with 26 (23) over 12 weeks showing "LT4/LT3 < LT4", a parallel, blinded study with 71 (60) over 4 months with "NS", and a cross-over, blinded study with 110 (101) over 10 weeks showing "LT4/LT3 > LT4". Across symptom measures, "There was no significant difference in thyroid-specific symptom questionnaires between treatment groups in the seven trials measuring these outcomes". For body weight, "Of the nine trials… the end of trial weight was significantly reduced… in only one trial at a TSH-suppressive dose… (LT4:LT3: 5:1 ratio)… with no significant differences observed in the other studies". Resting heart rate was evaluated in "11 trials", with effects characterized as increased in "one trial", reduced in "three trials", and "no significant difference… in seven trials". Regarding patient preference, "Among the five blinded, cross-over design trials… combination LT4/LT3 treatment was preferred to LT4 in four trials… whereas there was no significant difference… in only one trial", but "the total number of patients who completed the studies in these four positive cross-over design preference trials was only 128", and interpretation is limited by "a lack of validation and standardization of measurement of this construct among trials".

### Hypothyroidism: diagnosis and treatment [^1f5b3bab]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical hypothyroidism affects one in 300 people in the United States, with a higher prevalence among female and older patients. Symptoms range from minimal to life-threatening (myxedema coma); more common symptoms include cold intolerance, fatigue, weight gain, dry skin, constipation, and voice changes. The signs and symptoms that suggest thyroid dysfunction are nonspecific and nondiagnostic, especially early in disease presentation; therefore, a diagnosis is based on blood levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroxine. There is no evidence that population screening is beneficial. Symptom relief and normalized thyroid-stimulating hormone levels are achieved with levothyroxine replacement therapy, started at 1.5 to 1.8 mcg per kg per day. Adding triiodothyronine is not recommended, even in patients with persistent symptoms and normal levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone. Patients older than 60 years or with known or suspected ischemic heart disease should start at a lower dosage of levothyroxine (12.5 to 50 mcg per day). Women with hypothyroidism who become pregnant should increase their weekly dosage by 30% up to nine doses per week (i.e., take one extra dose twice per week), followed by monthly evaluation and management. Patients with persistent symptoms after adequate levothyroxine dosing should be reassessed for other causes or the need for referral. Early recognition of myxedema coma and appropriate treatment is essential. Most patients with subclinical hypothyroidism do not benefit from treatment unless the thyroid-stimulating hormone level is greater than 10 mIU per L or the thyroid peroxidase antibody is elevated.

### Levothyroxine treatment for congenital hypothyroidism based on thyroid function: a 10-year clinical retrospective study [^9e5c1aab]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

An identical high initial dose of levothyroxine for all CH patients has been challenged by Mathai et al. who retrospectively explored the strategy of using a variable initial dosage of levothyroxine. They categorized CH patients by etiology and administered levothyroxine at dosages of 10, 12, and 15 μg/kg·d for patients who were diagnosed with thyroid hormone synthesis disorder, ectopic thyroid, and thyroid agenesis, respectively. After treatment, they successfully normalized the serum FT4 of all patients within 14 d. Furthermore, the authors also demonstrated that a lower initial thyroxine dosage (9.98 ± 3.19 μg/kg·d) could also cause FT4 levels to return to normal within 16 d. Another study performed by Bakker et al. (2002) was carried out in 30 newborns with CH who received levothyroxine dosage ranging from 4.8–11.1 μg/kg·d. They found that there was no association between the initial dosage and the time of FT4 normalization, either in the low-dose group (6.4 ± 2.1 μg/kg·d) or the high-dose group (11.8 ± 1.4 μg/kg·d); both groups reached normal FT4 and TSH levels in a similar time-frame. Tuhan et al. (2016) used three different dosages (6–9.9 μg/kg·d, 10–11.9 μg/kg·d, and 12–17 μg/kg·d) for CH treatment and showed that there was no difference in TSH levels at 1 month after treatment.

### Establishing the adequate levothyroxine dose after total thyroidectomy: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^45d6e99e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Conduct of Review

The present systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO (ID 1061048). The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed in reporting this study (Supplemental Material 1).

Search Strategy

A comprehensive literature search was performed using PubMed/MEDLINE and Embase databases. The search aimed to identify studies reporting the proportion of "euthyroid" patients at their first follow-up after thyroidectomy and the strategy employed to estimate the LT4 starting dose. Euthyroid patients were defined as those with TSH levels within the target range specified in each article. For benign diseases, a higher TSH range was used, whereas for malignant conditions, risk-stratified TSH targets were applied. The search was restricted to articles published in English from January 1, 2000, to October 30, 2024. The online search was conducted by the following algorithm: [(levothyroxine) or (L-thyroxine) or (LT4)] and [(thyroidectomy) or (athyreotic)] and (dose). In the attempt to expand the search, references in the retrieved articles were also screened to identify additional studies.

Study Selection

The inclusion criteria were original studies reporting the number of patients achieving euthyroidism at the first postthyroidectomy evaluation and the criteria used to prescribe the initial LT4 dose. Exclusion criteria were studies lacking data on postthyroidectomy follow-up or underlying thyroid pathology, review articles, and outdated publications. Two independent researchers (I.C. P.C.) screened titles and abstracts based on these criteria. Subsequently, all authors independently reviewed the full text of eligible articles to confirm their inclusion in the final analysis.

Data Extraction

For each included study, the following information was extracted independently by 2 investigators (I.C. P.C.) in a piloted form: (1) study details (authors, publication year, and country of origin); (2) patient demographics [median age, body mass index (BMI), and sex]; (3) underlying thyroid pathology (benign or malignant); (4) LT4 dosing method; (5) follow-up data for the first and second postthyroidectomy controls. Extracted data were cross-checked for accuracy, and discrepancies were resolved through discussion. When studies included 2 (or more) different populations according to the LT4 dosing strategy employed, they were reported as separate series.

Primary Hypothyroidism in Adults and in Adolescents in Whom Growth and Puberty Are Complete

Start LEVOXYL at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non-elderly individuals who have been hypothyroid for only a short time (such as a few months). The average full replacement dose of LEVOXYL is approximately 1.6 mcg per kg per day (for example: 100 mcg per day to 125 mcg per day for a 70 kg adult).

Adjust the dose by 12.5 mcg to 25 mcg increments every 4 to 6 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. Doses greater than 200 mcg per day are seldom required. An inadequate response to daily doses of greater than 300 mcg per day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors.

For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with a dose of 12.5 mcg to 25 mcg per day. Increase the dose every 6 to 8 weeks, as needed until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. The full replacement dose of LEVOXYL may be less than 1 mcg per kg per day in elderly patients.

In patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism, start with a dose of 12.5 mcg to 25 mcg per day. Adjust the dose in 12.5 mcg to 25 mcg increments every 2 to 4 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH level is normalized.

Secondary or Tertiary Hypothyroidism

Start LEVOXYL at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non-elderly individuals. Start with a lower dose in elderly patients, patients with underlying cardiovascular disease or patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism as described above. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of LEVOXYL dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum free-T4 level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Titrate LEVOXYL dosing per above instructions until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum free-T4 level is restored to the upper half of the normal range.

### Evidence-based use of levothyroxine / liothyronine combinations in treating hypothyroidism: a consensus document [^2fd05e86]. Thyroid (2021). Medium credibility.

Background: Fourteen clinical trials have not shown a consistent benefit of combination therapy with levothyroxine (LT4) and liothyronine (LT3). Despite the publication of these trials, combination therapy is widely used and patients reporting benefit continue to generate patient and physician interest in this area. Recent scientific developments may provide insight into this inconsistency and guide future studies. Methods: The American Thyroid Association (ATA), British Thyroid Association (BTA), and European Thyroid Association (ETA) held a joint conference on November 3, 2019 (live-streamed between Chicago and London) to review new basic science and clinical evidence regarding combination therapy with presentations and input from 12 content experts. After the presentations, the material was synthesized and used to develop Summary Statements of the current state of knowledge. After review and revision of the material and Summary Statements, there was agreement that there was equipoise for a new clinical trial of combination therapy. Consensus Statements encapsulating the implications of the material discussed with respect to the design of future clinical trials of LT4/LT3 combination therapy were generated. Authors voted upon the Consensus Statements. Iterative changes were made in several rounds of voting and after comments from ATA/BTA/ETA members. Results: Of 34 Consensus Statements available for voting, 28 received at least 75% agreement, with 13 receiving 100% agreement. Those with 100% agreement included studies being powered to study the effect of deiodinase and thyroid hormone transporter polymorphisms on study outcomes, inclusion of patients dissatisfied with their current therapy and requiring at least 1.2μg/kg of LT4 daily, use of twice daily LT3 or preferably a slow-release preparation if available, use of patient-reported outcomes as a primary outcome (measured by a tool with both relevant content validity and responsiveness) and patient preference as a secondary outcome, and utilization of a randomized placebo-controlled adequately powered double-blinded parallel design. The remaining statements are presented as potential additional considerations. Discussion: This article summarizes the areas discussed and presents Consensus Statements to guide development of future clinical trials of LT4/LT3 combination therapy. The results of such redesigned trials are expected to be of benefit to patients and of value to inform future thyroid hormone replacement clinical practice guidelines treatment recommendations.

### Levothyroxine treatment for congenital hypothyroidism based on thyroid function: a 10-year clinical retrospective study [^2872b6d9]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

In our retrospective observation of patients administered individualized dosages of levothyroxine according to their initial TSH level at diagnosis, after 1 month, there were four patients (10.8%) in group A, one patient (3.8%) in group B, four patients (23.5%) in group C, and three patients (8.3%) in group D who did not reach the normal TSH level. Furthermore, there were eight patients (21.6%) in group A, one patient (3.8%) in group B, and one patient (2.7%) in group D who had an FT4 level beyond the upper limit of normal values at 1 month following treatment. At the follow-up time, the dosage of levothyroxine for each patient was adjusted according to thyroid function, and their thyroid function eventually returned to a normal range. Our study suggests that to reduce the risk of levothyroxine overdose, individualized levothyroxine dosage should be adjusted. Currently, there is no exact dosage for patients with different TSH levels; however, for most patients with mildly elevated TSH, low-dose thyroxine could restore their TSH level to normal 1 month after treatment. It is critical to follow up regularly during treatment to monitor thyroid function and adjust the thyroxine dosage to maintain thyroid function within the normal range.

Research performed by Soliman et al. (2012) revealed that 25% of the patients (n = 45) treated with a high dose of levothyroxine (10–15 μg/kg·d) developed hyperthyroidism. Craven and Frank (2018) reported that a high initial levothyroxine dosage (> 12.5 μg/kg·d) may have caused hyperthyroidism. After a period of follow-up, more than half of the patients required a reduction in their dosage; thus, the authors suggested reducing the initial dosage to avoid overtreatment. Nevertheless, comparative studies between individualized treatment and high initial dosage treatment are scarce. We explored the correlation between levothyroxine dosage and patient thyroid function and between thyroid function restoration time and patient TSH levels after individualized treatment through a clinical retrospective study.

### Congenital hypothyroidism: long-term growth and intellectual outcomes with a lower initial levothyroxine dose [^c8571506]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Methods and Materials

2.1 Study Design

We retrospectively reviewed the electronic medical records of the CH children treated with Levothyroxine at the Department of Paediatric Endocrinology in Ajou University Hospital between 2003 and 2024. The institutional review board approved the study, and since it involved solely data from medical records and did not harm the subjects, informed consent was waived (IRB: AJOUIRB‐SM‐2024‐461).

Patients were included if they had undergone newborn screening and initiated Levothyroxine therapy based on either a markedly elevated initial thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) > 40 μIU/mL, confirmatory TSH > 20 μIU/mL or follow‐up TSH > 10 μIU/mL after 4 weeks, in line with current guidelines. Both in‐house and referred cases were eligible. Among the Levothyroxine‐treated CH children (n = 765), we excluded the ones with known congenital anomalies, extreme prematurity with gestational age (GA) below 32 weeks, and very low birth weight (BW) below 1500 g (n = 190), which are known to impair the growth and neurodevelopment in children. Since recombinant growth hormone use might mask the growth impairment, the ones prescribed with recombinant growth hormone were also excluded.

Initial Levothyroxine doses were determined by paediatric endocrinologists, in reference to international guidelines (typically 10−15 mcg/kg/day). However, during the early study period, the available formulations were limited to 50, 100 and 150 mcg tablets, which were commonly divided into 25 or 33 mcg doses for neonates. This constrained dosing flexibility, especially in neonates with lower body weight. Furthermore, the widespread implementation of newborn screening led to increased identification of milder cases of CH, in which clinicians tended to opt for more conservative initial doses. As a result, a range of initial doses was observed across the cohort. For the purpose of analysis, we stratified patients into 'Low' (< 10 mcg/kg) and 'High' (10−15 mcg/kg) dose groups, using the lower boundary of current guidelines as the cutoff.

### Levothyroxine dosing in older adults: recommendations derived from the Baltimore longitudinal study of aging [^454efac2]. Endocrine Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

As thyroid hormone metabolism slows with advancing age, treatment dosing requirements change. Guidelines recommend titration from a low starting dose for older adults with hypothyroidism while providing weight-based estimates for younger populations. However, rapid replacement may be appropriate with acute onset of overt hypothyroidism. Therefore, a weight-based recommendation specific to older adults is needed.

Methods

We determined mean levothyroxine dose using actual and ideal body weight (IBW) ratios for the outcome of euthyroid on therapy relative to assay-specific and proposed age-specific ranges for independently living participants aged ≥ 65 years in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. We examined risk factors to identify those at highest risk of overtreatment using regression analyses adjusted for potential covariables and clustering to account for multiple visits per individual.

Results

One hundred eighty-five participants aged ≥ 65 years were on levothyroxine at 645 eligible visits. At euthyroid visits, participants were on an average dose of 1.09 μg/kg (1.35 μg/kg IBW), with 84% of euthyroid individuals on a dose of < 1.6 μg/kg. Average euthyroid dose did not differ by sex using either actual body weight (ABW) or IBW. For obese individuals, mean euthyroid dose was lower if calculated using ABW (0.9 μg/kg vs 1.14 μg/kg; P < .01) but similar if calculated using IBW (1.42 vs 1.32 μg/kg IBW; P = 0.41) compared with those with a body mass index of < 30.

Conclusion

Thyroid hormone dose per body weight estimates for replacement in older adults (1.09 μg/kg ABW or 1.35 μg/kg IBW) are one-third lower than current weight-based dose recommendations for younger populations.

### Sex and age differences in levothyroxine dosage requirement [^d9820518]. Endocrine Practice (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the performance of weight-based formulae for estimating the levothyroxine dosage requirement in athyreotic patients and to determine whether formula performance is affected by age, sex, or menstrual status.

Methods

In this prospective study, euthyroid study participants aged 18 to 65 years were followed up after total thyroidectomy at 4 time points: 6–8 weeks, 12–16 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year. Patient weight, serum thyrotropin concentration, and levothyroxine dosage required were recorded at each time point. The postoperative starting levothyroxine dosage was 1.7 mcg/kg daily for patients with benign thyroid disease and 2.2 mcg/kg daily for patients with thyroid cancer. Actual body weight was used to calculate the initial dosage. At steady state, adjustments were made in each patient's levothyroxine dosage until the target thyrotropin concentration was reached. The levothyroxine dosage required to achieve this goal was documented.

Results

Fifty patients were included (37 women, 13 men). Formulae based on actual body weight were accurate in achieving a normal thyrotropin concentration in 48% to 75% of participants. Final dosages to achieve normal thyrotropin values were similar in men (1.43 mcg/kg daily) and menopausal women (1.68 mcg/kg daily), but higher in premenopausal women (2.10 mcg/kg daily). When a formula based on ideal body weight was used, the requirement for menopausal women (2.34 mcg/kg daily) was similar to that of premenopausal women (2.44 mcg/kg daily), but the requirement for men (1.73 mcg/kg daily) remained lower than that observed in both female groups.

Conclusions

When actual body weight was used to calculate levothyroxine dosage requirement, premenopausal women appeared to have a greater requirement than either menopausal women or men. When ideal weight was used, the requirement of all women was greater than that of men. Perhaps with formulae using actual weight, this apparent sex difference is masked by the greater weight, older age, or altered hormonal milieu of menopausal women.

### Levothyroxine [^1907d5d8]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

Thyroid hormones cross the placental barrier to some extent as evidenced by levels in cord blood of athyroceotic fetuses being approximately one third maternal levels. Transfer of thyroid hormone from the mother to the fetus, however, may not be adequate to prevent in utero, hypothyroidism.

Nursing Mothers

Although thyroid hormones are excreted only minimally in human milk, caution should be exercised when Levothyroxine Sodium Tablets, USP is administered to a nursing woman. However, adequate replacement doses of levothyroxine are generally needed to maintain normal lactation.

Pediatric Use

General

The goal of treatment in pediatric patients with hypothyroidism is to achieve and maintain normal intellectual and physical growth and development.

The initial dose of levothyroxine varies with age and body weight (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Table 3). Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and laboratory parameters (see PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests).

In children in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, it is recommended that levothyroxine administration be discontinued for a 30-day trial period, but only after the child is at least 3 years of age. Serum T4 and TSH levels should then be obtained. If the T4 is low and the TSH high, the diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism is established, and levothyroxine therapy should be reinstituted. If the T4 and TSH levels are normal, euthyroidism may be assumed and, therefore, the hypothyroidism can be considered to have been transient. In this instance, however, the physician should carefully monitor the child and repeat the thyroid function tests if any signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism develop. In this setting, the clinician should have a high index of suspicion of relapse. If the results of the levothyroxine withdrawal test are inconclusive, careful follow-up and subsequent testing will be necessary.

### Outcomes and management of immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced hypothyroidism: a retrospective analysis [^b53deaf7]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) used in cancer treatment cause immune-related adverse effects (irAEs), including thyroiditis leading to hypothyroidism. The management and outcomes of this irAE are not well established.

Objective

The purpose of this analysis is to describe the onset, management, and outcomes of patients experiencing hypothyroidism from ICI.

Methods

A retrospective study was conducted of adults receiving ICI therapy at a community cancer center between January 1, 2017, and February 1, 2020. The primary endpoint was to describe onset (timing) of hypothyroidism (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] > 10 µIU/mL). Secondary outcomes included describing hypothyroidism symptoms and levothyroxine use, time to documented disease progression, and occurrence of additional adverse effects (AEs).

Results

Of the 200 patients included in the study, 19% developed clinical hypothyroidism (TSH > 10 µIU/mL, or required initiation of or dose increase in levothyroxine). Median time to TSH higher than 10 µIU/mL was 13.3 weeks and symptoms of hypothyroidism occurred in 34% of patients developing clinical hypothyroidism. The median final daily levothyroxine dose was 88 mcg (0.88 mcg/kg). Time to disease progression was longer in those with clinical hypothyroidism (27.4 months vs. 6.8 months, respectively, P = 0.015). Additional AEs occurred in 68% of those developing hypothyroidism versus 49% without hypothyroidism (P = 0.029).

Conclusion and Relevance

Patients with clinical hypothyroidism during ICI treatment may have improved cancer outcomes, but they also are more likely to develop other AEs. Patients requiring thyroid replacement therapy with levothyroxine may benefit from a starting dose between 50 and 100 mcg/day, approximately 0.88 mcg/kg/day.

### Prospective intervention of a novel levothyroxine dosing protocol based on body mass index after thyroidectomy [^c9a8308f]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Weight-based postoperative levothyroxine (LT4) dosing often fails to appropriately dose overweight and underweight patients. Previously, we created an LT4-dosing algorithm based on BMI. We hypothesize that more patients will achieve euthyroidism at their postoperative visit with the use of the protocol.

Study Design

A prospective evaluation was performed of our previously published BMI-based LT4 dosing. All adults who underwent thyroidectomy for benign disease between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2013 were included; the new protocol was implemented in October 2012. Serum TSH was measured for all patients 6 to 8 weeks postoperatively, and adjustments were based on TSH.

Results

Three hundred and thirty patients were included, with 54% undergoing thyroidectomy after institution of the protocol. The groups were well matched. Before protocol implementation, LT4 was dosed solely by weight and 25% of patients were euthyroid at initial follow-up. After the protocol, 39% of patients were euthyroid (p = 0.01). The percentage of patients who were given too high a dose of LT4 remained the same (46% vs 42%), and there was a significant reduction in the number of patients who were given too little (29% vs 19%; p = 0.05). The effect was most profound in patients with low and normal BMI, and there were slight differences between sexes.

Conclusions

Although correct initial dosing of LT4 remains challenging, this dosing protocol that we developed and implemented has improved patient care by increasing the number of patients who achieve euthyroidism at the first postoperative visit. We have made a change to our original protocol to incorporate sex differences into the calculation.

### The ages and TSH values of patients being prescribed levothyroxine [^a12e4943]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

We also present new data about LT4 doses in individuals being prescribed LT4 and the effect of having or not having a diagnosis of hypothyroidism on prescribing patterns. With respect to LT4 doses, the fact that the 50 µg dose was the one most frequently prescribed, irrespective of whether or not a diagnosis of hypothyroidism had been definitely documented, further illustrates that mild degrees of hypothyroidism are being treated, or possibly that hypothyroidism was not present at all. Although the authors do not have data regarding the percentage of patients who had low TSH values following initiation of LT4, it could be hypothesized that in some patients treatment simply lowered their TSH values from the upper to the lower end of the normal range. A full replacement dose of LT4 is approximately 100 µg in someone of about 70 kg with minimal residual endogenous thyroid function. This dose was prescribed in 13.6–15.6% of those with a documented diagnosis of hypothyroidism, and 14.7–16.2% of those with no documentation of hypothyroidism.

Surprisingly, in addition to the pattern of LT4 dosage use not differing on the basis of whether a diagnosis of hypothyroidism was present or not, the ages of patients receiving LT4 did not seem to differ depending on whether a diagnosis of hypothyroidism had been formally documented or not. The mean age of initiation of LT4 prescriptions was similar regardless of whether the patient's EMR contained a diagnosis of hypothyroidism or not. Prescription initiation seemed to be prevalent across all age groups, although the number of prescriptions rose on an annual basis most notably in those of 50–69 years of age. The second most frequent age range in which LT4 was initiated was in those of 60–69 years, with substantial initiation occurring in older age groups also. This is concerning, as there are fewer data about the benefits of LT4 therapy in older age groups, but clear risks of over-replacement. In addition, based on age-specific reference ranges for TSH values, it is possible that many of these older individuals may not actually have hypothyroidism. Although mild TSH elevation may be associated with cardiac dysfunction, there may not be benefits in older individuals, who also have additional considerations because of frailty.

Regarding medical management for congenital hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to levothyroxine, dosing and administration, Endo-ERN 2021 guidelines recommend to initiate levothyroxine at the highest starting dose (10–15 mcg/kg/day) in infants with severe CH, defined by a very low pretreatment serum fT4 (< 5 pmol/L) or total thyroxine concentration in combination with elevated TSH (above the normal range based on time since birth and gestational age).

Background

A number of recent advances in our understanding of thyroid physiology may shed light on why some patients feel unwell while taking levothyroxine monotherapy. The purpose of this task force was to review the goals of levothyroxine therapy, the optimal prescription of conventional levothyroxine therapy, the sources of dissatisfaction with levothyroxine therapy, the evidence on treatment alternatives, and the relevant knowledge gaps. We wished to determine whether there are sufficient new data generated by well-designed studies to provide reason to pursue such therapies and change the current standard of care. This document is intended to inform clinical decision-making on thyroid hormone replacement therapy; it is not a replacement for individualized clinical judgment.

Methods

Task force members identified 24 questions relevant to the treatment of hypothyroidism. The clinical literature relating to each question was then reviewed. Clinical reviews were supplemented, when relevant, with related mechanistic and bench research literature reviews, performed by our team of translational scientists. Ethics reviews were provided, when relevant, by a bioethicist. The responses to questions were formatted, when possible, in the form of a formal clinical recommendation statement. When responses were not suitable for a formal clinical recommendation, a summary response statement without a formal clinical recommendation was developed. For clinical recommendations, the supporting evidence was appraised, and the strength of each clinical recommendation was assessed, using the American College of Physicians system. The final document was organized so that each topic is introduced with a question, followed by a formal clinical recommendation. Stakeholder input was received at a national meeting, with some subsequent refinement of the clinical questions addressed in the document. Consensus was achieved for all recommendations by the task force.

Results

We reviewed the following therapeutic categories: (i) levothyroxine therapy, (ii) non-levothyroxine-based thyroid hormone therapies, and (iii) use of thyroid hormone analogs. The second category included thyroid extracts, synthetic combination therapy, triiodothyronine therapy, and compounded thyroid hormones.

Conclusions

We concluded that levothyroxine should remain the standard of care for treating hypothyroidism. We found no consistently strong evidence for the superiority of alternative preparations (e.g., levothyroxine-liothyronine combination therapy, or thyroid extract therapy, or others) over monotherapy with levothyroxine, in improving health outcomes. Some examples of future research needs include the development of superior biomarkers of euthyroidism to supplement thyrotropin measurements, mechanistic research on serum triiodothyronine levels (including effects of age and disease status, relationship with tissue concentrations, as well as potential therapeutic targeting), and long-term outcome clinical trials testing combination therapy or thyroid extracts (including subgroup effects). Additional research is also needed to develop thyroid hormone analogs with a favorable benefit to risk profile.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^e2a5f855]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 11 — patient follow-up after RAI therapy for GD: Follow-up within the first 1–2 months after RAI therapy for GD should include an assessment of free T4, total T3, and TSH, and biochemical monitoring should be continued at 4- to 6-week intervals for 6 months, or until the patient becomes hypothyroid and is stable on thyroid hormone replacement; strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Most patients respond with normalization of thyroid function and symptom improvement within 4–8 weeks, and hypothyroidism may occur from 4 weeks, with 40% hypothyroid by 8 weeks and > 80% by 16 weeks. Beta-blockers started prior to RAI should be tapered when free T4 and total T3 return to the reference range; as free T4 and total T3 improve, methimazole (MMI) can usually be tapered. Most patients eventually develop hypothyroidism indicated by free T4 below normal; levothyroxine should then be instituted, TSH should not be used initially to determine the need, and replacement dose should be adjusted based on free T4 with careful titration. Once euthyroidism is achieved, lifelong annual thyroid function testing is recommended at least annually, and since TSH may remain suppressed for a month or longer after hyperthyroidism resolves, interpret TSH cautiously and only with free T4 and total T3.

General

The goal of treatment in pediatric patients with hypothyroidism is to achieve and maintain normal intellectual and physical growth and development.

The initial dose of levothyroxine varies with age and body weight (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Table 3). Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and laboratory parameters (see PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests).

In children in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, it is recommended that levothyroxine administration be discontinued for a 30-day trial period, but only after the child is at least 3 years of age. Serum T4and TSH levels should then be obtained. If the T4is low and the TSH high, the diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism is established, and levothyroxine therapy should be reinstituted. If the T4and TSH levels are normal, euthyroidism may be assumed and, therefore, the hypothyroidism can be considered to have been transient. In this instance, however, the physician should carefully monitor the child and repeat the thyroid function tests if any signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism develop. In this setting, the clinician should have a high index of suspicion of relapse. If the results of the levothyroxine withdrawal test are inconclusive, careful follow-up and subsequent testing will be necessary.

Since some more severely affected children may become clinically hypothyroid when treatment is discontinued for 30 days, an alternate approach is to reduce the replacement dose of levothyroxine by half during the 30-day trial period. If, after 30 days, the serum TSH is elevated above 20mU/L, the diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism is confirmed, and full replacement therapy should be resumed. However, if the serum TSH has not risen to greater than 20mU/L, levothyroxine treatment should be discontinued for another 30-day trial period followed by repeat serum T4and TSH testing.

The presence of concomitant medical conditions should be considered in certain clinical circumstances and, if present, appropriately treated (see PRECAUTIONS).

American Thyroid Association — congenital hypothyroidism dosing and monitoring use weight-based levothyroxine (LT4) with age-specific needs, definitions of starting doses, treatment targets, and follow-up. Newborn requirements are higher, with "newborns typically requiring 10 μg/kg/d, 1-year-old children 4–6 μg/kg/d, adolescents 2–4 μg/kg/d, with transition to the average adult dose of 1.6 μg/kg/d once endocrine maturation is complete". In CH, "standard or low-dose therapy is defined by a range of 5–10 μg/kg/d, while high-dose regimens are defined as a range of 10–15 μg/kg/d", and "Starting doses of 10–15 μg/kg/d have been reported to normalize T4 levels within 2–3 weeks, while doses < 8 μg/kg/d result in normalization within 6–8 weeks". Targets are to "keep the T4 level in the mid to upper half of the reference range and the TSH in the mid to lower half of the reference range, optimally between 0.5 and 2.0 mIU/L". For follow-up, "surveillance testing with a TSH and T4 should be performed every 1–2 months during the first year of life", and "For patients with severe CH, monthly surveillance during the first 6–12 months may be indicated". For possible transient CH, "For patients with mild CH and no change in the LT4 dose over the first 3 years of life, a trial off LT4 therapy is reasonable", and permanence is confirmed if on "repeat testing 4–6 weeks after stopping LT4 therapy" the "TSH rises and the T4 decreases". Formulation and interactions are important: "Within the United States, there are no liquid formulations and there are no compounding processes that produce a stable concentration of LT4 in suspension. Efforts to create suspensions should be avoided", and "Soy, iron, calcium, and infant colic drops (simethicone) can decrease the absorption of LT4, and concurrent ingestion should be avoided". In selected cases with persistent TSH elevation despite adequate LT4 levels, "the addition of LT3 may result in normalization of TSH".
