Treatment for atopic deratitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step treatment approach for atopic dermatitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and establishing baseline severity. Then, I should verify foundational skin care and trigger management. Next, I will stratify therapy by severity and map escalation pathways, including topical, phototherapy, and systemic options. After that, I need to check special populations and safety considerations, and finally, I should confirm monitoring, maintenance, and shared decision-making principles to close the loop on long-term control.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and baseline assessment, because I need to ensure we are treating true atopic dermatitis and not mimickers like contact dermatitis or psoriasis; I should use validated tools such as EASI, vIGA-AD, and POEM, and screen for atopic comorbidities including asthma, allergic rhinitis, food allergy, sleep disturbance, anxiety, and depression, as these affect both diagnosis confidence and treatment selection [^111Xwkaj] [^117X3GTK] [^115L36MR].

> Next, I should review foundational skin care and trigger management, since barrier repair and avoidance of exacerbating factors are the backbone of therapy; I need to ensure daily liberal emollients, gentle soap-free cleansers, and bathing routines are in place, and I should counsel on trigger identification and mitigation, including environmental, occupational, and psychosocial contributors, while remembering that evidence for many avoidance strategies is mixed and must be individualized [^113nm1YC] [^114jjtHC] [^116u6aUq].

> For mild disease, let me think about the lowest effective potency topical corticosteroids used intermittently, typically twice daily for about two weeks or until improvement, followed by proactive maintenance; I should confirm that guidelines support proactive therapy with topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors to reduce flares, and I need to check that crisaborole is a reasonable nonsteroidal option for maintenance in sensitive areas, balancing efficacy and tolerability [^113s1jyc] [^1119UmyG] [^116sXU2x].

> For moderate disease, I should double-check that combining a mid-potency topical corticosteroid with a calcineurin inhibitor improves outcomes and allows steroid-sparing; I need to ensure proactive maintenance with twice-weekly application to previously inflamed sites, and I should consider adding crisaborole or a topical JAK inhibitor such as ruxolitinib for recalcitrant areas, while monitoring for application-site reactions and counseling on proper technique and expectations [^116sXU2x] [^113s1jyc] [^112KRgHm].

> For severe disease, I will now examine phototherapy and systemic options; narrowband UVB is a reasonable second-line choice when topical therapy is insufficient, and I should confirm that biologics such as dupilumab, tralokinumab, and lebrikizumab are effective and generally well tolerated, with dupilumab having robust long-term safety data, while JAK inhibitors like upadacitinib, abrocitinib, and baricitinib offer rapid control but require attention to boxed warnings and individual risk profiles [^115gRpXX] [^114Su9uU] [^112sQtgi] [^111RgiXC].

> Hold on, I should verify the stance on systemic corticosteroids; guidelines consistently recommend against routine use due to rebound and adverse effects, reserving very short courses only as a bridge in exceptional circumstances when no alternatives exist, and I need to ensure I document the rationale if I ever consider this route [^1171ZRnY] [^117CMeH9] [^114KmSet].

> Let me consider special populations carefully; in children, I should confirm that dupilumab is approved down to age 6 months and that topical ruxolitinib is approved for adolescents, while in older adults I should review polypharmacy and infection risk, noting tralokinumab's favorable profile in seniors; in pregnancy, I need to check that data remain limited and favor topical-first strategies with cautious systemic escalation, and in skin of color, I should remember that erythema may present as brown, violaceous, or gray hues and that treatment response differences have not been clearly demonstrated across agents [^113PL4vs] [^113DzNCH] [^111Qv1et].

> I should double-check infection management and pruritus strategies; for bacterial superinfection, short courses of antistaphylococcal antibiotics are appropriate when indicated, and for eczema herpeticum I must treat promptly with acyclovir and pause topical steroids temporarily; for pruritus, I need to ensure anti-inflammatory control is optimized before considering sedating antihistamines at night, which have limited standalone efficacy but may help with sleep [^114oUvfv] [^116u6aUq] [^1175PfZL].

> Next, I should review monitoring and maintenance; I need to ensure follow-up every 3 months during active therapy and every 6 months when stable, track EASI or vIGA and patient-reported outcomes, and reinforce proactive maintenance to prevent flares; I should confirm that shared decision-making is emphasized across guidelines, aligning choices with patient values, access, and comorbidities, and I must plan for tapering systemic agents once stable control is sustained [^112mUkbh] [^111q2fWX] [^1155HCio].

> But wait, what if topical therapy appears to "fail"; I should verify adherence and application technique before escalating, consider the role of allergen immunotherapy selectively in refractory cases with clear allergic triggers, and keep an eye on emerging agents such as OX40-pathway inhibitors and novel topicals like roflumilast and tapinarof, integrating new evidence as it matures into practice [^1172Bu9R] [^112MVniL] [^117UQXQE].

> In summary, I need to ensure a severity-stratified, stepwise approach that starts with barrier repair and trigger management, escalates thoughtfully through topical anti-inflammatories, phototherapy, and targeted systemic therapies, avoids routine systemic corticosteroids, and embeds proactive maintenance and shared decision-making to sustain long-term control and quality of life improvements [^115m9iKZ] [^113nm1YC] [^115gRpXX].

---

Atopic dermatitis treatment is **stepwise and individualized**, starting with **emollients and trigger avoidance** for all patients, then adding **topical corticosteroids** for flares and **calcineurin inhibitors** for sensitive areas or maintenance [^113nm1YC]. For moderate-to-severe disease, escalate to **dupilumab** or JAK inhibitors (upadacitinib, abrocitinib, baricitinib) [^112sQtgi]; tralokinumab and lebrikizumab are alternatives [^112sQtgi]. Phototherapy is an option when systemic therapy is unsuitable; **systemic corticosteroids are not recommended** for long-term use due to rebound and adverse effects [^1171ZRnY]. Educate on adherence, skin care, and trigger management to optimize control and quality of life [^114jjtHC].

---

## General principles of management

- **Patient education**: Emphasize adherence, skin care, and trigger avoidance [^114jjtHC].
- **Trigger identification**: Avoid allergens, irritants, stress, and climate extremes [^114jjtHC].
- **Skin care**: Daily emollients and gentle cleansing to repair the barrier [^116u6aUq].

---

## Topical therapies

### Topical corticosteroids (TCS)

- **First-line**: For acute flares; use lowest effective potency for shortest duration [^116u6aUq].
- **Potency**: Low for face/intertriginous areas; medium-high for trunk/extremities [^notfound].
- **Adverse effects**: Skin atrophy, telangiectasia, striae; monitor with prolonged use [^113cPtmB].

---

### Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs)

- **Indication**: Sensitive areas (face, intertriginous) or steroid-sparing maintenance [^113s1jyc].
- **Agents**: Tacrolimus 0.03%/0.1% and pimecrolimus 1% [^notfound].
- **Adverse effects**: Transient burning/itching; minimal systemic absorption [^notfound].

---

### Topical phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors

Crisaborole 2% is indicated for **mild-to-moderate AD** and is generally well tolerated, though application-site burning or stinging may occur [^113s1jyc].

---

### Topical Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors

Ruxolitinib 1.5% is indicated for **mild-to-moderate AD**; local application-site reactions may occur [^notfound].

---

## Systemic therapies

### Systemic corticosteroids

Use is limited to **short courses (≤ 1 week)** for severe flares when other options are unavailable, given the risk of rebound and adverse effects [^114KmSet].

---

### Traditional immunosuppressants

- **Cyclosporine**: Effective for severe AD; monitor for nephrotoxicity, hypertension, infections [^111n2Cbv].
- **Methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil**: Options for refractory cases; monitor lab parameters [^1174zUcg].

---

### Biologic therapies

- **Dupilumab**: IL-4/IL-13 inhibitor; first-line biologic for moderate-to-severe AD; sustained efficacy and favorable safety profile [^114Su9uU].
- **Tralokinumab**: IL-13 inhibitor; effective alternative to dupilumab [^113PL4vs].
- **Lebrikizumab**: IL-13 inhibitor; comparable efficacy to dupilumab in recent trials [^112sQtgi].

---

### Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors

- **Upadacitinib**: JAK1 inhibitor; effective for moderate-to-severe AD; monitor for infections, thrombosis, malignancy [^113VpJ5u].
- **Abrocitinib**: JAK1 inhibitor; effective alternative [^notfound].
- **Baricitinib**: JAK1/2 inhibitor; effective, especially in patients with concomitant rheumatoid arthritis [^111RgiXC].

---

## Phototherapy

Phototherapy options include **narrowband UVB** — effective for moderate-to-severe AD with minimal adverse effects — and **PUVA**, which is effective but carries a higher risk of malignancy and is therefore less commonly used.

---

## Adjunctive therapies

- **Antihistamines**: Sedating agents may help with sleep-disrupting pruritus [^notfound].
- **Wet wrap therapy**: Short-term for severe flares; monitor for infections [^notfound].
- **Dilute bleach baths**: Reduce bacterial colonization; use cautiously [^notfound].

---

## Emerging therapies

Emerging therapies include **OX40 inhibitors** (rocatinlimab, amlitelimab) — promising for refractory AD — and **topical agents** such as tapinarof, roflumilast, and difamilast, which are under investigation [^111r4VQf] [^113cPtmB].

---

## Special populations

In **pediatrics**, first-line therapy consists of emollients and topical corticosteroids; TCIs, dupilumab, and upadacitinib are approved for children, whereas systemic corticosteroids should be avoided [^113qCGXt] [^114oUvfv] [^117CMeH9]. In **pregnancy**, topical corticosteroids and TCIs are preferred; systemic therapies should be avoided unless clearly indicated.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular visits should **assess disease control, adherence, and adverse effects** [^112mUkbh]. Use validated tools such as EASI, SCORAD, and POEM to track outcomes [^111Xwkaj].

---

## Summary of treatment algorithm

| **Severity** | **First-line therapy** | **Second-line therapy** | **Third-line therapy** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Mild | Emollients, low-potency TCS, TCIs | Topical JAK/PDE-4 inhibitors | ∅ |
| Moderate | Medium-potency TCS, TCIs, emollients | Phototherapy, dupilumab | JAK inhibitors |
| Severe | High-potency TCS, TCIs, emollients | Phototherapy, dupilumab, cyclosporine | JAK inhibitors, other biologics |

---

Effective AD management requires a **stepwise approach**, with escalation based on severity and patient factors. Emphasize education, adherence, and trigger avoidance to sustain control and improve quality of life [^114UP3qh].

### Atopic dermatitis yardstick: practical recommendations for an evolving therapeutic landscape [^115dmaij]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

The implementation of treatment guidelines for atopic dermatitis is challenging, in part because of different guidance documents being used by different groups of specialists and in part because the language of guidelines often reflects the evidence base rather than the practical "how to". The Atopic Dermatitis Yardstick is part of a series developed in response to the need to proactively address the loss of disease control for atopic illnesses at all levels of severity. It presents a comprehensive update on how to conduct a sustained step-up in therapy for the patient with inadequately controlled or poorly controlled atopic dermatitis. Patient profiles, based on current guidelines and the authors' combined clinical experience, provide a practical and clinically meaningful guide to aid physicians in helping their patients achieve the goal of clear to almost clear. The intent is not to replace guidelines but to complement their recommendations incorporating the latest research and therapies.

### Atopic dermatitis guidelines: diagnosis, systemic therapy, and adjunctive care [^112rg1WB]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is an important and chronic skin condition that has recently been the subject of enormous volumes of basic science, clinical, and epidemiologic research. This field is undergoing rapid expansion, making it vitally important to integrate the emerging data with our current body of knowledge. In 2014, the American Academy of Dermatology published Guidelines of Care for the Management of Atopic Dermatitis, composed of four parts, reflecting the work of 17 experts from North America and the United Kingdom. 1–4 It uses a patient-oriented system, SORT (Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy), to provide evidence-based guidance in the management of this common, vexing dermatitis. These guidelines join a series of similar efforts published recently across the world, reflecting universal interest in distilling the tremendous volume of basic scientific and clinical data previously generated. 5–7 With new therapies rapidly emerging, clinicians require a current understanding of the field to be able to incorporate new treatments in their practice.

### How we treat atopic dermatitis now and how that will change over the next 5 years [^115LGFE3]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

We live in exciting times in atopic dermatitis therapeutics, with many novel treatments in the clinical trial pipeline. Frustratingly, most of these trials are vehicle- or placebo-controlled, rather than head-to-head comparisons. Network meta-analyses can rank treatments against each other, even for placebo-controlled studies, aiding evidence-based guideline formulation and clinical decision-making. Treatment registries are an important additional vehicle to collect 'real-world' data on the long-term (cost) effectiveness and safety of the new drugs, outside of the stringent and short-term settings of clinical trials. As further agents enter clinical practice, the need for biomarkers of treatment response and drug safety becomes more pressing to move us towards personalized medicine and to avoid wasting healthcare resources. This review takes stock of our current treatment armamentarium for atopic dermatitis, highlights important gaps in our knowledge - including the relatively low number of studies conducted in children - and maps out how our treatment approaches for atopic dermatitis can become more targeted and holistic in the future.

### Future perspectives in the treatment of atopic dermatitis [^1144ju5D]. The Journal of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is a chronically relapsing inflammatory skin disease with an increasing prevalence. The guidelines for the treatment of atopic dermatitis enable us to manage many patients with atopic dermatitis under a global consensus, which also contributes to improving their quality of life. However, there remain some patients with atopic dermatitis whose symptoms cannot be satisfactorily controlled using the therapeutic management recommended by the guidelines. Recent genetic, immunological and physiological insights into the pathomechanisms of atopic dermatitis are expected to overcome the limitations of the currently available treatment. Advances in pharmacology and biotechnology will also provide more efficient and safer medications. In this review, the limitations of the currently available therapies and the advantages and disadvantages of new approaches for the treatment of atopic dermatitis including topical and systemic immunosuppressants as well as biologics and anti-pruritic agents are discussed. Potential new cellular targets for the treatment of atopic dermatitis are also illustrated.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis: section 1. diagnosis and assessment of atopic dermatitis [^111Xwkaj]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis diagnosis and assessment — scope of guideline states that this guideline addresses the diagnosis and assessment of pediatric and adult atopic dermatitis (AD; atopic eczema) of all severities, and that other forms of dermatitis, such as irritant dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis in those without AD, are outside of the scope of this document. It specifies that this document is the first section in the series and covers methods for diagnosis and monitoring of AD, disease severity and quality of life scales for outcomes measurement, and common clinical associations that affect patients, and notes that a discussion on known risk factors for the development of AD is also presented. It further states that the second guideline in the series will address the management and treatment of AD with pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic topical modalities; the third section will cover phototherapy and systemic treatment options; and the fourth section will address the minimization of disease flares, educational interventions, and use of adjunctive approaches.

### Expert perspectives on management of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis: a multidisciplinary consensus addressing current and emerging therapies [^114aHnb3]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common, chronic, relapsing, inflammatory skin disease that affects children and adults. Until recently, the only Food and Drug Administration-approved systemic treatment option for patients with moderate-to-severe AD was systemic steroids, which are not recommended by current guidelines and are commonly associated with disease rebound. Instead, clinicians choose from several off-label immunosuppressants, which can have serious adverse effects. A significant number of these patients go untreated. Research on the immunopathogenesis of AD has paved the way for new, targeted, systemic therapies for moderate-to-severe AD. In early 2017, the Food and Drug Administration approved dupilumab for adults with moderate-to-severe AD whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical therapies. Although the national guidelines can be very helpful to clinicians, the process for updating them does not allow for timely incorporation of novel therapies. A steering committee of AD experts, including dermatologists, allergists, and a patient advocacy group representative, developed recommendations on the basis of a literature review and expert opinion to help clinicians understand how new therapies fit into the current treatment paradigm and to provide practical recommendations for assessing AD severity, treatment response, and treatment failure.

### English version of clinical practice guidelines for the management of atopic dermatitis 2021 [^117FEGvj]. The Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

This is the English version of the Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Atopic Dermatitis 2021. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a disease characterized by relapsing eczema with pruritus as a primary lesion. In Japan, from the perspective of evidence-based medicine, the current strategies for the treatment of AD consist of three primary measures: (i) use of topical corticosteroids, tacrolimus ointment, and delgocitinib ointment as the main treatment of the inflammation; (ii) topical application of emollients to treat the cutaneous barrier dysfunction; and (iii) avoidance of apparent exacerbating factors, psychological counseling, and advice about daily life. In the present revised guidelines, descriptions of three new drugs, namely, dupilumab, delgocitinib, and baricitinib, have been added. The guidelines present recommendations to review clinical research articles, evaluate the balance between the advantages and disadvantages of medical activities, and optimize medical activity-related patient outcomes with respect to several important points requiring decision-making in clinical practice.

### The effects of treatment on itch in atopic dermatitis [^1117gxW7]. Dermatologic Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Pruritus causes significant impairment in the quality of life of patients suffering from atopic dermatitis. Treatments for itch in atopic dermatitis range from simple avoidance of pruritus triggers to more complicated systemic therapy. Several treatments aim to target specific mediators of itch in atopic dermatitis, whereas others improve pruritus by reducing inflammation. Currently the most effective treatments for atopic dermatitis-associated itch are primarily topical or systemic anti-inflammatory agents. Better management of pruritus in atopic dermatitis is an important goal and necessitates the development of novel targeted treatments as well as efficient use of current therapies.

### New topical and systemic treatments for atopic dermatitis [^111qUAie]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Atopic dermatitis is an inflammatory skin condition characterised by pruritus and a chronic relapsing–remitting course. The pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis is complex and involves local epidermal barrier dysfunction and immune dysregulation driven by genetics and environmental factors. Historically, topical and systemic treatments for atopic dermatitis were broadly immunosuppressive and, particularly for systemic treatments, were associated with harmful long‐term side effects. More effective and safe therapies have been developed recently as our mechanistic understanding of atopic dermatitis has improved. In this review, we summarise new topical and systemic treatments for atopic dermatitis, their relative effectiveness, and important safety information.

### Development of a clinical pathway for atopic dermatitis patients: a case-based approach [^1135frh8]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic skin condition, associated with significant patient morbidity. There are a myriad of excellent evidenced based guidelines to guide clinicians by an extensive review of all the available treatments. However, while well written and complete these papers may not always allow easy transition to clinical application.

Objective

The purpose of this paper was to develop a practical case-based approach for the treatment and maintenance of AD, enabling translation of guidelines into clinical care.

Methods

After literature searches, selected AD trials and recent existing guidelines were reviewed. Using a nominal group process for consensus, an expert panel of Canadian dermatologists determined the case features and corresponding treatments.

Results

A patient focused clinical pathway with 7 cases was developed. For each case scenario, treatment for mild, moderate, and severe disease was recommended.

Conclusion

A practical case-based clinical pathway was developed for easy clinical application and optimal patient care. J Drugs Dermatol. 2016;15(12):1485–1494.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis: section 4. prevention of disease flares and use of adjunctive therapies and approaches [^114jjtHC]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis guideline — scope states that this guideline addresses the treatment of pediatric and adult atopic dermatitis (AD) of all severities and that the treatment of other forms of eczematous dermatitis is outside the scope of this document. Recommendations on AD management are subdivided into 4 sections to update and expand on the clinical information and recommendations previously published in 2004. This document is the final in the series of 4 publications and discusses the management and control of AD flares using topical modalities and the utility and timing of allergen testing and avoidance, and also discusses the use of adjunctive therapies and approaches, such as environmental, dietary, and educational interventions, in addition to complementary therapies.

### Italian guidelines for therapy of atopic dermatitis-adapted from consensus-based European guidelines for treatment of atopic eczema (atopic dermatitis) [^115sM365]. Dermatologic Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) therapeutic approach calls for a long-term treatment. Treatment options for AD have recently undergone a revolutionary change by the introduction of the first biologic drug. Availability in daily practice of the last version of international AD guidelines, taking peculiarities of the country into account, can contribute to good clinical practice in Italy. To adapt European Dermatology Forum (EDF) guidelines for AD to the Italian medical-legal context, the EDF guidelines were assessed independently by two independent Italian renowned experts in the field and further integrated with articles published and systematically reviewed before May 2019. The first draft was collegially corrected and updated by the members of the SIDEMAST, ADOI, and SIDAPA. Recommendation levels (A; B; C; D) were graded based on the evidence levels (1–4). The adapted guidelines presented here focus on topical and systemic therapies in AD patients, both children and adults. As opposed to previous Italian guidelines, they include indications about biologics. New relevant evidence available from very recent literature and peculiarities of the Italian medical and legal context have been integrated in the revision process. If compared to general guidelines for AD not adapted to a specific national and cultural context, a revision for specific Italian needs is now available: It comprises the option of implementing the new biologic treatments and is likely to provide an important contribution to the improvement of clinical practice in Italy. Cooperation between patients, dermatologists, allergologists, and pediatricians remains mandatory in AD management. The authors of the present revision recommend an update of the Italian guidelines to be performed at least every second year.

### Advances in atopic dermatitis in 2017 [^113MUpBv]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

This review encompasses relevant scientific and clinical advances in atopic dermatitis (AD) published in 2017. These include articles from the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, as well as other prominent publications that have contributed to the emerging field, on the microenvironment of the skin and molecular patterns guiding biologic treatment strategies. The most commonly questioned and explored themes of the year included the effect of the microbiome on AD development, as well as cell signaling and symptom severity. Topics also included the description of patient-specific molecular endotypes within the larger population with AD. All of these factors will create potential opportunities to guide personalized therapy with the broadening array of topical and systemic interventions currently available, as well as providing new insights to guide the development of novel molecularly targeted therapeutics. With recent US Food and Drug Administration approval of the first wave of new targeted therapies for AD, additional information exploring the safety profiles and long-term effects of these medications was also at the forefront in 2017.

### Topical therapy for atopic dermatitis: what is new and the new paradigm [^115KEB8n]. Dermatologic Clinics (2024). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder that requires a complex management strategy, which often involves multiple and diverse topicals and systemic treatment regimens. While topical steroids and more recently calcineurin inhibitors have been the mainstay therapy for mild-to-moderate disease, recent advances in the understanding of AD pathogenesis have led to the development of different new targets, rapidly widening our therapeutic armamentarium. This review summarizes their efficacy and safety data. We also review topical optimization strategies, including the recently published topical volume calculator, to maximize long-term disease control, especially when using multiple agents at the same time.

### What's new in atopic dermatitis [^115j4B8S]. Dermatologic Clinics (2019). Medium credibility.

The evolving discoveries in atopic dermatitis (AD) shed light on disease pathogenesis and allow better management of patients. Dupiluamab was the first targeted agent approved for AD, proving for the first time AD can be treated with a single cytokine antagonism. Nevertheless, because not all patients respond to dupilumab and AD has a heterogeneous phenotype, more treatment options are much needed. This article reviews recent and exciting developments in AD, because ongoing or pipeline clinical trials for AD will ultimately expand and redefine a novel treatment paradigm for this common disease.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis: section 1. diagnosis and assessment of atopic dermatitis [^111C7uM9]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) gaps in research — the expert group's priorities emphasize that while much is known about diagnosis and evaluation, much has yet to be learned. Significant gaps in research were identified, including but not limited to: validation studies of the AAD workgroup diagnostic criteria, development, validation, and uniformity in use of disease severity and quality of life measurements applicable to a busy clinical practice environment, interventional studies testing impact of multidisciplinary management on AD outcomes, and additional quality, controlled studies on epidemiologic risk factors for disease. It is hoped that additional knowledge of AD pathogenesis will soon lead to a proven biomarker for diagnosis and/or monitoring, and that AD-associated pruritus is better understood to generate improved therapeutic options.

### Allergy and dermatology US treatment guidelines review for adults with atopic dermatitis [^11467JVF]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, inflammatory condition that affects patients of all ages. Dermatologists and allergists often treat these patients, with each group of specialists following distinct sets of guidelines. Therefore, patients may receive different management depending on the specialist whom they consult.

Objective

The goal of this article is to identify similarities and differences in the treatment of adults with AD using the most recent management guidelines in the United States put forth by the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology/American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters.

Methods

The management guidelines for adults with AD from the American Academy of Dermatology and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology/American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters were reviewed to highlight similarities and differences.

Results

We identified key similarities in the use of newer biologic agents, including dupilumab and tralokinumab. There are differences between the recommendations for topical phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors, including crisaborole, and both topical and systemic Janus kinase inhibitors, including ruxolitinib, upadacitinib, abrocitinib, and baricitinib.

Conclusion

This article highlights the fact that although the updated management guidelines for adults with AD in dermatology and allergy align on certain recommendations, notable differences that could influence clinical decision making remain. Despite both sets of guidelines being evidence-based, variations in recommendations arise when factoring in patient preferences, perspectives, and risk aversion. As newer treatments become available for patients with AD, it will be important to monitor the evolving concordance or discordance of these guidelines given their direct impact on patient care.

### Comparison of dermatology and allergy guidelines for atopic dermatitis management [^112qDf4V]. JAMA Dermatology (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common skin condition treated by dermatologists, allergists, pediatricians, and primary care physicians. Several treatment guidelines and therapeutic parameters exist for the management of this disease. Health care professionals may be unaware of guidelines created by specialty organizations other than their own.

Objective

To review, compare, and contrast the most recent AD management guidelines.

Evidence Review

The guidelines for AD management published by the American Academy of Dermatology 2014 work group were compared with those created by the 2012 Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters representing the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology; the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology; and the Joint Council of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. International guidelines created by the 2012 European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis and the 2013 Asia-Pacific Consensus Group for Atopic Dermatitis were also considered.

Findings

Several differences among the guidelines suggest that there may be disparity in the perceptions of AD between US dermatologists and allergists and health care professionals in other areas of the world. There are notable differences among the guidelines regarding the recommendations for the use of diluted bleach baths, vitamin D, and environmental modifications.

Conclusions and Relevance

Comparison of different guidelines may ultimately augment knowledge of treatment strategies and enhance realization of biases in the understanding and management of AD.

### Atopic dermatitis (eczema) guidelines 2023: highlights [^1155HCio]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is a common chronic inflammatory skin disorder, with a complex pathogenesis. It is characterized by eczematous skin lesions, pruritus, and recurrent skin infections and has a negative impact on patients' and caregivers' quality of life. The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology/American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Joint Task Force Atopic Dermatitis Guideline Panel recently released updated AD guidelines. This guideline focuses on addressing clinical questions using trustworthy guideline development standards, including mitigating the potential influence of financial and nonfinancial conflicts of interest, and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology. A multidisciplinary panel used systematic reviews and meta-analyses to inform specific recommendations addressing optimal use of topical treatments, dilute bleach bath, dietary avoidance/elimination, allergen immunotherapy, and systemic treatments. The comprehensive recommendations, emphasizing the third principle of evidence-based medicine-that evidence alone is never enough, and that patient values and preferences must be carefully considered when determining optimal treatments for patients and populations-provide a framework to support clinicians in selecting an optimal treatment plan for each patient. This review provides an overview of the guideline and discusses how those recommendations relate to current practice.

### Current guidelines for the evaluation and management of atopic dermatitis: a comparison of the joint task force practice parameter and American Academy of Dermatology guidelines [^116qQQM5]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic pruritic inflammatory disease that commonly presents in the pediatric population. Although definitions and diagnosis of AD have largely been agreed upon, allergists and dermatologists have similar and divergent approaches to the management of AD. This review facilitated integration of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology/American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology Joint Task Force 2012 AD Practice Parameter and the 2014 American Academy of Dermatology guidelines to highlight the basic principles of AD management and discuss therapies and management of AD from the distinct perspectives of the allergist and dermatologist.

### Guideline-based approach in the management of atopic dermatitis [^116udUzZ]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

This is an exciting time in the management of atopic dermatitis due to the development of several biologics, Janus Kinase inhibitors, and new topical therapies. Furthermore, evidence-based guidelines allow provision of individualized patient care. Management includes education on trigger avoidance, appropriate use of topicals to ensure efficacy and avoid side effects while attending to the psychosocial needs and priorities of the patient/caregivers. The synthesis of this information facilitates a balanced discussion of risks, benefits, and alternatives to allow for shared decision-making. Together these options provide an opportunity to improve the quality of life of patients with atopic dermatitis.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis in adults with topical therapies [^116sXU2x]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

New evidence has emerged since the 2014 guidelines that further informs the management of atopic dermatitis (AD) with topical therapies. These guidelines update the 2014 recommendations for management of AD with topical therapies.

Objective

To provide evidence-based recommendations related to management of AD in adults using topical treatments.

Methods

A multidisciplinary workgroup conducted a systematic review and applied the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) approach for assessing the certainty of evidence and formulating and grading recommendations.

Results

The workgroup developed 12 recommendations on the management of AD in adults with topical therapies, including nonprescription agents and prescription topical corticosteroids (TCS), calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs), Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors (PDE-4), antimicrobials, and antihistamines.

Limitations

The pragmatic decision to limit the literature review to English-language randomized trials may have excluded data published in other languages and relevant long-term follow-up data.

Conclusions

Strong recommendations are made for the use of moisturizers, TCIs, TCS, and topical PDE-4 and JAK inhibitors. Conditional recommendations are made for the use of bathing and wet wrap therapy and against the use of topical antimicrobials, antiseptics, and antihistamines.

### Strategies used for measuring long-term control in atopic dermatitis trials: a systematic review [^1173q9NS]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease. There are no standardized methods for capturing long-term control of AD.

Objective

We sought to identify how long-term control has been captured in published randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Results will initiate consensus discussions on how best to measure long-term control in the core outcome set for AD.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of RCTs of AD treatments published between 2000 and 2013, with a follow-up period of 3 months or longer, at least 1 outcome measure recorded at 3 or more time points, full article available, and published in English.

Results

In all, 101 of 353 RCTs were eligible. Methods to capture long-term control included: repeated measurement of AD outcomes (92 RCTs; 91%), use of AD medication (29 RCTs; 28.7%), and AD flares/remissions (26 RCTs; 25.7%). Repeated measurements of AD outcomes were typically collected 3 to 5 times during a trial, but analysis methods often failed to make best use of the data. Time to first flare was most commonly used for trials including flare data (21/52). Medication use was recorded based on quantity, potency, and frequency of application.

Limitations

We included RCT data only.

Conclusion

This review illustrates the difficulties in measuring long-term control, and points to the need for improved harmonization of outcomes.

### EAACI biologicals guidelines-dupilumab for children and adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis [^116qWgSB]. Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis imposes a significant burden on patients, families and healthcare systems. Management is difficult, due to disease heterogeneity, co-morbidities, complexity in care pathways and differences between national or regional healthcare systems. Better understanding of the mechanisms has enabled a stratified approach to the management of atopic dermatitis, supporting the use of targeted treatments with biologicals. However, there are still many issues that require further clarification. These include the definition of response, strategies to enhance the responder rate, the duration of treatment and its regimen (in the clinic or home-based), its cost-effectiveness and long-term safety. The EAACI Guidelines on the use of dupilumab in atopic dermatitis follow the GRADE approach in formulating recommendations for each outcome and age group. In addition, future approaches and research priorities are discussed.

### Atopic dermatitis [^115m9iKZ]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is the most common chronic inflammatory skin disease globally. Key features include an eczematous eruption accompanied by intense itch, which can have an enormous negative effect on patients' quality of life, especially in those with moderate-to-severe disease. Atopic dermatitis is part of a spectrum of atopic conditions that can also include several non-cutaneous organs such as respiratory (eg, allergic rhinitis and asthma) and gastrointestinal (eg, food allergy) systems. For decades, long-term disease control and maintenance were particularly challenging given that treatment options were limited to broad topical and systemic immunosuppressive agents. However, better insights into the pathophysiology of this condition over the past decade have led to the development and approval of safe and efficacious novel targeted treatment approaches. The updated pathophysiological understanding and the evolving therapeutic landscape of atopic dermatitis are discussed in this Seminar.

### Past, present, and future for biologic intervention in atopic dermatitis [^111hYjGS]. Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a debilitating disease that significantly alters the quality of life for one in four children and one in 10 adults. Current management of AD utilizes combinations of treatments to symptomatically alleviate disease by suppressing the inflammatory response and restoring barrier function in the skin, reducing disease exacerbation and flare, and preventing secondary skin infections. Resolution is temporary and long-term usage of these treatments can be associated with significant side-effects. Antibody therapies previously approved for inflammatory diseases have been opportunistically evaluated in patients with atopic dermatitis; however, they often failed to demonstrate a significant clinical benefit. Monoclonal antibodies currently in development offer hope to those individuals suffering from the disease by specifically targeting immune and molecular pathways important for the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis. Here, we review the underlying biological pathways and the state of the art in therapeutics in AD.

Table VI. Assessment of clinical associations of atopic dermatitis (AD) — Physicians should be aware of and assess for conditions associated with AD, such as rhinitis/ rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma, food allergy, sleep disturbance, depression, and other neuropsychiatric conditions, and it is recommended that physicians discuss them with the patient as part of the treatment/ management plan, when appropriate; an integrated, multidisciplinary approach to care may be valuable and is suggested for AD patients who present with common associations, and these recommendations are based on group consensus because there is no high-quality, conclusive evidence to show that screening for them leads to improved patient outcomes.

### New insights and treatments in atopic dermatitis [^116JcCNF]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is a complex, chronic inflammatory skin disorder with significant morbidity. It is often a frustrating condition for both children and parents due to chronic and relapsing course. There is now an increasing understanding of the disease pathogenesis resulting in discovery of much wanted newer therapeutics and targeted therapies after a long time. Whether these interventions will result in sustained benefits or long term cure remains to be seen.

### Future treatment options for atopic dermatitis-small molecules and beyond [^113c4wuP]. Journal of Dermatological Science (2014). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common eczematous skin disease with a chronic and relapsing course. Current therapeutic options for moderate to severe AD in children and adults are unsatisfactory. Along with the success of basic research to define pathogenesis-related targets, novel small molecule inhibitors and biologics for the treatment of AD have been developed. These compounds focus on the specific reduction of pruritus, interfere with the pro-allergic Th2-deviation of the immune system or inhibit inflammatory pathways in the skin. Based on studies registered at ClinicalTrials.gov we present novel treatment strategies of AD, their molecular mechanisms of action, and discuss the current status of the clinical results. As many of the new compounds target pathogenesis-related traits of the disease, we face a new era in the treatment and understanding of AD.

### Atopic dermatitis-from new pathophysiologic insights to individualized therapy [^111CowKe]. Allergy (2011). Low credibility.

Recently, important novel insights into the complex pathophysiology of atopic dermatitis (AD) have been gained. However, in most cases the therapy of AD is limited to base line therapy with emollients combined with symptomatic, rather general immunosuppressive treatment approaches of the flare-ups. Latest research findings together with experiences from daily clinical practice, which support the concept that a combination of general disease features together with specific trigger factors in the individual patients drive the disease, might be helpful for a subclassification of patients with AD based on the most relevant pathophysiologic modifications. Subclassification of patients with AD seems indispensable to introduce rationale-based, individualized treatment approaches of AD, which target specific modified pathways. In this review, we provide an overview about a selection of pathophysiologic pathways, which hold promise to represent targets of such therapeutic approaches in the near future.

### Atopic dermatitis prevention [^115X5CCp]. Dermatologic Therapy (2006). Low credibility.

A shift in focus from disease therapy toward disease prevention is occurring in many medical specialties, including dermatology. There are no generally accepted strategies for the prevention of atopic dermatitis. Most research has focused on allergen avoidance and has not produced consistently effective interventions. Immune cell modulation and skin barrier protection are examples of new approaches that hold promise for preventing, or modifying the course of, this common disease.

### What's new in topicals for atopic dermatitis? [^116NBjAZ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The aim of developing targeted therapy for AD is to provide control of inflammation and pruritus with improvement of barrier function while minimizing AEs seen with the use of TCSs and TCIs. By elucidating the complex pathogenesis of AD, additional targets for therapy can be developed. Many patients with AD require lifelong treatment. Thus, there is an unmet need for topical therapies with high efficacy and low risk of AEs with long-term use. Non-steroidal topical therapies that work regionally with minimal systemic effects may deliver effective disease control, without concerns of skin atrophy, telangiectasia, striae, or perioral dermatitis associated with TCSs. These novel treatments are part of the frontier for expanding our armamentarium to bring relief to a wider range of AD patients with varying needs.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis in adults with phototherapy and systemic therapies [^115gRpXX]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Atopic dermatitis in adults — phototherapy and systemic therapies guideline overview states that for people with atopic dermatitis refractory to topical therapies, treatment with phototherapy and systemic therapies can be considered, and multiple biologic therapies and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors have been approved since 2014 to treat AD. It aims to provide evidence-based recommendations on these modalities in adults, based on a multidisciplinary systematic review using the GRADE approach to assess certainty and grade recommendations. The workgroup developed 11 recommendations on management with phototherapy and systemic agents, including biologics, oral JAK inhibitors, and other immunomodulatory medications, while noting that most randomized controlled trials are of short duration with subsequent extension studies, limiting comparative long-term efficacy and safety conclusions.

### Translating atopic dermatitis management guidelines into practice for primary care providers [^114UP3qh]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis affects a substantial number of children, many of whom seek initial treatment from their pediatrician or other primary care provider. Approximately two-thirds of these patients have mild disease and can be adequately managed at the primary care level. However, recent treatment guidelines are written primarily for use by specialists and lack certain elements that would make them more useful to primary care providers. This article evaluates these recent treatment guidelines in terms of evaluation criteria, treatment recommendations, usability, accessibility, and applicability to nonspecialists and integrates them with clinical evidence to present a streamlined severity-based treatment model for the management of a majority of atopic dermatitis cases. Because each patient's situation is unique, individualization of treatment plans is critical as is efficient communication and implementation of the plan with patients and caregivers. Specifically, practical suggestions for individualizing, optimizing, implementing, and communicating treatment plans such as choosing a moisturizer formulation, avoiding common triggers, educating patients/caregivers, providing written treatment plans, and scheduling physician follow-up are provided along with a discussion of available resources for patients/caregivers and providers.

### Treatment outcomes associated with dupilumab use in patients with atopic dermatitis: 1-year results from the RELIEVE-AD study [^114Tkweu]. JAMA Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are the benefits of treatment with dupilumab in the clinical practice setting from the perspective of patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis?

Findings

In this prospective, longitudinal study in the clinical practice setting, 699 patients with atopic dermatitis who initiated dupilumab treatment were administered a survey over the 12-month study duration that included measures of disease control, treatment satisfaction, symptoms, health-related quality of life, and work and activity impairment. Patients reported adequate disease control, treatment satisfaction, and improvement in other outcomes that were significant vs baseline at the earliest evaluated assessment (1 month; 632 patients), and these improvements were maintained over the study period (12 months; 483 patients).

Meaning

This cohort study found that use of dupilumab for the treatment of atopic dermatitis was associated with early (1 month) of patient-reported benefits that were maintained after 12 months of therapy.

### Safety and efficacy of tralokinumab in older adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis: a secondary analysis [^113PL4vs]. JAMA Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

In an older adult population (≥ 65 years) that has polypharmacy and increased safety risks, what are the safety and efficacy outcomes following treatment with tralokinumab for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis?

Findings

In this secondary analysis of 3 randomized clinical trials of 75 older adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, treatment with tralokinumab was well tolerated and effective.

Meaning

The results of this secondary analysis suggest that tralokinumab has a safe, tolerable, and effective profile for use in older patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis who typically face unique treatment challenges.

### Translating translation into patient benefit for atopic eczema [^111n2Cbv]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Evidence‐based treatments for atopic eczema

Atopic eczema is a disabling long‐term skin condition that has a profound negative impact on patients and their families and therapeutic options for moderate‐to‐severe disease remain limited. Although onset is usually in early childhood, atopic eczema may persist (particularly in more severe cases) or recur during adulthood where a prevalence of ~3–10% 1, 2 is reported. A significant percentage of adult patients have resistant disease that can significantly impair quality of life. Refractory moderate‐to‐severe atopic eczema in adults usually runs a prolonged and protracted course 3 and the unpredictable nature of disease flares is particularly troublesome. 4 The mainstay of treatment remains topical steroids and moisturisers. In 2000 an independent systematic review 5 highlighted the lack of therapeutic options for patients with atopic eczema not adequately controlled by optimised topical treatments and underscored the need for scientifically robust testing of a range of treatments for the disease. Indeed, there remains just one oral drug with a product license for moderate‐to‐severe atopic eczema, ciclosporin. Furthermore, the British National Formulary recommends that treatment duration with cicloporin should be limited period for a maximum period of 2 months maximum in part because prolonged use of the drug is associated with hypertension, renal impairment and risk of cancer. 6, 7, 8, 9 A robust evidence base supporting other treatment options for refractory moderate‐to‐severe atopic eczema was therefore needed.

### Use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis: international eczema council consensus statement [^117CMeH9]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines discourage the use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis (AD), but their use remains widespread.

Objectives

To reach consensus among an international group of AD experts on the use of systemic corticosteroids for AD.

Methods

A survey consisting of statements accompanied by visual analogue scales ranging from 'strongly disagree' to 'neutral' to 'strongly agree' was distributed to the International Eczema Council (IEC). Consensus was reached in agreement on a statement if < 30% of respondents marked to the left of 'neutral' towards 'strongly disagree'.

Results

Sixty of 77 (78%) IEC members participated. Consensus was reached on 12 statements, including that systemic corticosteroids should generally be avoided but can be used rarely for severe AD under certain circumstances, including a lack of other treatment options, as a bridge to other systemic therapies or phototherapy, during acute flares in need of immediate relief, in anticipation of a major life event or in the most severe cases. If used, treatment should be limited to the short term. Most respondents agreed that systemic corticosteroids should never be used in children, but consensus was not reached on that statement. The conclusions of our expert group are limited by a dearth of high-quality published evidence. If more stringent consensus criteria were applied (e.g. requiring < 20% of respondents marking towards 'strongly disagree'), consensus would have been reached on fewer statements.

Conclusions

Based on expert opinion from the IEC, routine use of systemic corticosteroids for AD is generally discouraged and should be reserved for special circumstances.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for atopic dermatitis [^112KRgHm]. JAMA Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

Clinical Question

Which topical anti-inflammatory treatments are most effective and safe for managing atopic dermatitis?

Bottom Line

In a network meta-analyses, very potent/potent topical corticosteroids; tacrolimus, 0.1%; and topical Janus kinase inhibitors were among the most effective treatments for short-term control of atopic dermatitis symptoms, while phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors were among the least effective. Topical calcineurin inhibitors and crisaborole were associated with application-site irritation, and short-term topical steroid use was not associated with skin thinning. However, these findings were of low to moderate certainty, and longer-term data remain limited for many agents.

### What's new in topicals for atopic dermatitis? [^113cPtmB]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that can have tremendous impact on quality of life for affected children and adults. First-line therapy for acute management of AD includes topical therapies such as corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and, more recently, the phosphodiesterase inhibitor crisaborole. Topical agents have remained the mainstay therapy for decades; however, there has been a longstanding need for topical therapies with high efficacy and low risk of adverse effects with long-term use. Given the ongoing advances in understanding the pathogenesis of AD, there are novel targets for pharmacological intervention. We are now in an unprecedented time with more than 40 topical treatments in the pipeline for AD in addition to many developments and treatments on the horizon. This review summarizes selected therapeutic topical agents in later phases of development that target various aspects in the pathogenesis of AD such as Janus kinase inhibition (ruxolitinib and delgocitinib), phosphodiesterase-4 inhibition (roflumilast and difamilast), aryl hydrocarbon modulation (tapinarof), and modulation of the microbiome. We also review novel targeted therapies that are in early phase clinical trials, including AMTX-100, BEN-2293, and PRN473. Preliminary findings on efficacy and tolerability of most of these agents are promising, but further studies are warranted to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of these novel agents against the current standard of care.

### New topical and systemic treatments for atopic dermatitis [^111r4VQf]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Discussion

Over the last several years, there has been a tremendous expansion in the repertoire of treatments for atopic dermatitis. Most of these medications are based on efficacy in short‐term clinical studies. Longer clinical trials are often non‐comparative, making it difficult to draw strong conclusions. Whether treatment response holds over time is yet to be determined. Similarly, long‐term safety data is needed to detect rare side effects that would not have been captured in clinical trials with relatively small populations and short durations. In particular, more data comparing the long‐term safety profile of JAK inhibitors to biologics for atopic dermatitis is needed. Warnings for JAK inhibitors used for atopic dermatitis have been applied based on data from rheumatoid arthritis, a very different disease — atopic dermatitis‐specific data is essential.

Randomised clinical trials for systemic treatment can either be monotherapy trials, in which the use of topical anti‐inflammatory medications is prohibited, or combination therapy trials, where topical anti‐inflammatory medications are permitted alongside systemic treatment. The latter more closely resembles clinical practice, where most patients will continue topical therapy while beginning a new systemic therapy. NMAs summarised in this review include both monotherapy and combination therapy trials. Comparisons between systemic medications in the NMA are similar when pooling and separating monotherapy and combination therapy trials because topical anti‐inflammatory medications increase both placebo and active treatment response rates.

There are even more treatment advances on the horizon. Rocatinlimab and amlitelimab are two monoclonal antibodies that target OX40 signalling, a driver of multiple effector and memory T‐cell populations. Another monoclonal antibody, GSK1070806, targets IL‐18, a cytokine that is overexpressed in atopic dermatitis. IL‐18 knockout mice were less likely to develop atopic dermatitis compared to wild type. New drugs against established targets are also in the pipeline. These include AK120, an anti‐IL4Rα antibody, and LNK01001, a JAK1 inhibitor.

The rapidly evolving therapeutic landscape of atopic dermatitis is a testament to bench‐to‐bedside discovery. As new targeted therapies enter the market, the next challenge will be determining whether they stand the test of time and how to best translate their use into clinical practice.

Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Guidance addressing atopic dermatitis (AD) management, last issued in 2012 by the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology/American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Joint Task Force, requires updating as a result of new treatments and improved guideline and evidence synthesis methodology.

Objective

To produce evidence-based guidelines that support patients, clinicians, and other decision-makers in the optimal treatment of AD.

Methods

A multidisciplinary guideline panel consisting of patients and caregivers, AD experts (dermatology and allergy/immunology), primary care practitioners (family medicine, pediatrics, internal medicine), and allied health professionals (psychology, pharmacy, nursing) convened, prioritized equity, diversity, and inclusiveness, and implemented management strategies to minimize influence of conflicts of interest. The Evidence in Allergy Group supported guideline development by performing systematic evidence reviews, facilitating guideline processes, and holding focus groups with patient and family partners. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach informed rating the certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations. Evidence-to-decision frameworks, subjected to public comment, translated evidence to recommendations using trustworthy guideline principles.

Results

The panel agreed on 25 recommendations to gain and maintain control of AD for patients with mild, moderate, and severe AD. The eAppendix provides practical information and implementation considerations in 1–2 page patient-friendly handouts.

Conclusion

These evidence-based recommendations address optimal use of (1) topical treatments (barrier moisturization devices, corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, PDE4 inhibitors [crisaborole], topical JAK inhibitors, occlusive [wet wrap] therapy, adjunctive antimicrobials, application frequency, maintenance therapy), (2) dilute bleach baths, (3) dietary avoidance/elimination, (4) allergen immunotherapy, and (5) systemic treatments (biologics/monoclonal antibodies, small molecule immunosuppressants [cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate, JAK inhibitors], and systemic corticosteroids) and UV phototherapy (light therapy).

### Current and future monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of atopic dermatitis [^115SJ5W4]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is a common immunologic skin disease. Mild atopic dermatitis can be managed with emollients and topical therapies such as low potency topical steroids, which have a favorable safety profile. Severe atopic dermatitis, in contrast, is a challenging disease to treat. Topical therapies are typically inadequate for control of severe atopic dermatitis. When topical therapies fail, the mainstay of therapy for severe atopic dermatitis has traditionally been phototherapy or off-label use of systemic immunosuppressant treatment, yet systemic immunosuppressants all have significant potential toxicities, drug interactions, and contraindications, requiring close monitoring. Targeted biologics are therefore attractive treatment options for topical therapy-refractory cases of atopic dermatitis, with the potential to offer effective, safer treatment of uncontrolled atopic dermatitis. Dupilumab, as the only biologic therapy currently FDA-approved for atopic dermatitis, is effective for many patients, but there is need for continuing study of additional biologic therapies to address the needs of diverse patients with uncontrolled atopic dermatitis.

### Allergy and dermatology US treatment guidelines review for adults with atopic dermatitis [^111SpHQH]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic condition that involves a complex interplay between the immune system and the skin that manifests mainly as pruritus and an eczematous eruption. In the United States, patients with AD are typically managed by primary care physicians, dermatologists, and allergists. Both the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology/American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI) Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters (JTFPP) have independently developed guidelines for management of AD. The most recent AAD guidelines, published from 2022 to 2024, focus on adults with AD, not children, and are an update of the AD clinical guidelines that were published in 2014. In 2023, the JTFPP expanded on its 2012 AD Practice Parameter, with updated guidelines for both children and adults.,

In 2015 Mohan and Lio, successfully compared and contrasted the AD management guidelines put forth by the 2014 AAD work group and the 2012 JTFPP representing the AAAAI, the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, and the Joint Council of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. The management of AD has changed drastically since the review article of Mohan and Lio, especially related to the treatment of AD with medications such as biologics and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. Therefore, we are providing an updated comparison of the most recent dermatology and allergy AD guidelines to identify key similarities and differences in management of this condition in adults only, as there had not been a pediatric update from the AAD as of the time at which this review was performed.

2 Topical Treatments

Topical treatment options for atopic dermatitis have greatly expanded over the past 25 years. Topical corticosteroids have been the mainstay of therapy for decades and remain important first‐line treatments for most children and adults with atopic dermatitis. However, their clinical benefit is limited in some instances by the potential for local adverse events (AEs), particularly in sensitive anatomic locations such as the face and folds. Additionally, while topical corticosteroids are safe and effective for most people when used properly, patient concerns over AEs may negatively impact adherence.

The introduction of the topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs), tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, in the early 2000s was a major development for the treatment of atopic dermatitis, giving patients the first non‐corticosteroid topical anti‐inflammatory treatment option. TCIs work by blocking both Th(T helper cell)1 and Th2 immune responses and reduce inflammation and improve the skin barrier without the risk of atrophy. TCIs are not effective for all patients, particularly for more severe lesions of atopic dermatitis, and are limited by application‐site discomfort. Fortunately, the development of TCIs paved the way for other non‐steroidal targeted topical therapies.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) — skin tone–inclusive inflammation assessment and implications for care are described: The guideline states we define erythema to include transient skin alterations characteristic of active AD inflammation, including erythema, shades of brown, violaceous, or gray appearances. Postinflammatory dyspigmentation (hypo- or hyperpigmentation) may persist for months to years and be important to patients. Principles of AD care remain similar for all skin types, and the relevance of these findings to informing treatment selection is not clear and, so far, multiple agents display no differential treatment response across these groups.

### Topical steroids for atopic dermatitis in primary care [^115dncxy]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2003). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is very common. In most instances, the condition is relatively mild and can be managed in primary care. Topical corticosteroids are the standard therapy for controlling acute 'flares' of dermatitis. However, poor communication between doctors and patients often results in suboptimal use of such therapy. Here, we review the efficacy and safety of topical corticosteroids for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. We discuss their optimal use in primary care, and the advice and information that patients or parents of children need when using such treatment.

### A clinician's paradigm in the treatment of atopic dermatitis [^112N1UCu]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Successful management of atopic dermatitis requires a multipronged approach that includes skin barrier function care, use of topical or systemic agents, and identification and elimination of precipitating or exacerbating factors. Because the origin of atopic dermatitis is multifactorial and trigger factors differ among patients, treatment plans must be specific to the individual patient. This article offers an example of a permutational, or flexible, treatment paradigm. The approach utilizes 4 topical regimens — high-potency topical corticosteroids, lowest effective potency topical corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs), or topical corticosteroid/TCI combinations — as initial therapy in a variety of induction protocols, as determined by the severity of a patient's condition and history. The paradigm permits treatment to progress from a chosen induction therapy to maintenance therapy. During the patient's induction therapy, as soon as an acceptable level of clearance is achieved, therapy should be adjusted to a maintenance regimen, such as monotherapy with either a TCI or a lowest effective potency topical corticosteroid (the latter used intermittently) or an alternation of the two agents. If there is no clearance or positive response with the initial induction protocol, the clinician should move to one of the alternative regimens.

### Atopic dermatitis: an expanding therapeutic pipeline for a complex disease [^112MVniL]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2022). High credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease with a complex pathophysiology that underlies a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes. AD remains challenging to treat owing to the limited response to available therapies. However, recent advances in understanding of disease mechanisms have led to the discovery of novel potential therapeutic targets and drug candidates. In addition to regulatory approval for the IL-4Ra inhibitor dupilumab, the anti-IL-13 inhibitor tralokinumab and the JAK1/2 inhibitor baricitinib in Europe, there are now more than 70 new compounds in development. This Review assesses the various strategies and novel agents currently being investigated for AD and highlights the potential for a precision medicine approach to enable prevention and more effective long-term control of this complex disease.

### Atopic dermatitis: diagnosis and treatment [^116u6aUq]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (atopic eczema) is a chronic relapsing and remitting inflammatory skin disease affecting one in 10 people in their lifetime. Atopic dermatitis is caused by a complex interaction of immune dysregulation, epidermal gene mutations, and environmental factors that disrupts the epidermis causing intensely pruritic skin lesions. Repeated scratching triggers a self-perpetuating itch-scratch cycle, which can have a significant impact on the patient's quality of life. The American Academy of Dermatology has created simple diagnostic criteria based on symptoms and physical examination findings. Maintenance therapy consists of liberal use of emollients and daily bathing with soap-free cleansers. Use of topical corticosteroids is the first-line treatment for atopic dermatitis flare-ups. Pimecrolimus and tacrolimus are topical calcineurin inhibitors that can be used in conjunction with topical corticosteroids as first-line treatment. Ultraviolet phototherapy is a safe and effective treatment for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis when first-line treatments are not adequate. Antistaphylococcal antibiotics are effective in treating secondary skin infections. Oral antihistamines are not recommended because they do not reduce pruritus. Evidence is lacking to support the use of integrative medicine in the treatment of atopic dermatitis. Newer medications approved by the U.S Food and Drug Administration, such as crisaborole and dupilumab, are effective in treating atopic dermatitis but are currently cost prohibitive for most patients.

### New topical and systemic treatments for atopic dermatitis [^113v5vxN]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Atopic dermatitis is an inflammatory skin condition characterised by pruritus and a chronic relapsing–remitting course. Previous topical and systemic treatments for atopic dermatitis were broadly immunosuppressive, which limited their long‐term use. Recently, more targeted therapies for atopic dermatitis have been developed. In this review, we discuss the efficacy and safety of new therapies, including topical PDE4 (phosphodiesterase 4) inhibitors, a topical aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist, topical and systemic JAK (Janus kinase) inhibitors and biologics.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis in adults with topical therapies [^114w6FeW]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Adult atopic dermatitis topical therapies — scope and methods focus on providing evidence-based recommendations for the management of adult AD using topical therapies available and approved for use in the United States, covering nonprescription agents (moisturizers, bathing practices, wet wraps) and pharmacologic modalities including topical corticosteroids (TCS), topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs), Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) inhibitors, antimicrobials, and antihistamines. A multidisciplinary workgroup conducted a systematic review and employed the GRADE approach for assessing the certainty of evidence and for formulating and grading clinical recommendations; pediatric topical therapy will be addressed in a forthcoming guideline, and treatment of other forms of dermatitis outside AD is outside this document's scope.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is an inflammatory, pruritic skin disease that affects up to 10% of adults and 20% of children in developed countries. AD negatively impacts the health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients and their caregivers/families, with greater disease severity being associated with poorer HRQoL. Due to the complex pathophysiology of AD, guidelines recommend regimented hygiene, the use of moisturizers, topical steroids and calcineurin inhibitors, which can be used in combination with other treatments such as phototherapy for moderate‐to‐severe or refractory AD. The ultimate goals for treatment are to repair and maintain the skin barrier, to reduce sensations of itching and burning, and to prevent AD relapse. Despite current treatments, there is still an unmet need for safe and effective therapies to improve disease management and long‐term patient outcomes.

Guideline limitations — Limitations of these guidelines include focusing on the most common aspects of AD care, and the authors state they did not address Traditional, Complementary, or Integrative medicines or Indigenous Ways of Knowing, aiming to address these in subsequent living guidelines as evidence emerges. The guideline notes that AD lacks robust evidence for safety of medications during pregnancy and breastfeeding and calls for well-conducted studies for this population. It also highlights that many AD trials are placebo controlled and calls for funding and investigations through professional, government, and private organizations to promote comparative effectiveness and safety of approved medications and their optimal use in treatment pathways, with robust data in pregnant patients and comparative effectiveness informing future recommendations.

### Biological medication in atopic dermatitis [^112GKT1u]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder associated with intense itch/pruritus and skin lesions. Several modalities of treatment including topical therapy, systemic agents, and biologics are available for the treatment of disease. Despite this, management poses challenge due to chronic nature and recurrent episodes in many patients. Biologics represent an important option of treatment for patients who do not respond to the traditional treatment.

Areas Covered

In this article, we focused on efficacy and safety of biologics in the treatment of atopic dermatitis. Other therapies are out of the scope of this review. Articles from PubMed and Google scholar and cross references of retrieved articles were used to write the narrative review.

Expert Opinion

Biologics play an important role in the treatment of atopic dermatitis. Every biologic has its own place in the treatment considering pharmacological profile, efficacy, and safety. Several biologics have been studied in the treatment of moderate-to-severe cases who failed to provide adequate response to traditional treatment. Dupilumab, is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Tralokinumab and nemolizumab have shown promising results in patients with atopic dermatitis.

### Treatment of atopic dermatitis-AAP… [^114oUvfv]. AAP (2021). Medium credibility.

The treatment of atopic dermatitis includes the following simultaneous measures:

- Moisturizing the skin, for the purpose of
- Repairing and maintaining the skin barrier
- Hydrating the skin
- Reducing itch
- Treating inflammation
- Preventing and managing skin infections These treatment targets, when effectively addressed, not only improve disease symptoms and reduce flares but assist the child and family in achieving adequate sleep.
- Intranasal mupirocin If there is evidence of secondary bacterial infection, consider administering an oral antistaphylococcal antibiotic for 7 to 10 days. If no improvement is noted within 48 hours, consider a skin swab for bacterial culture to assess for resistant organisms depends on the extent and severity of the infection.
- Topical mupirocin can be used for limited skin lesions.
- Cephalexin is a common first-choice when MRSA is not suspected.
- Simultaneously treat for repair of skin barrier.
- **Diagnosis**: usually made clinically with confirmation by polymerase chain reaction testing or viral culture of vesicular fluid
- Treatment
- Acyclovir administered orally or intravenously for 7 to 10 days.
- Because recurrences are common, daily antiviral prophylaxis may be warranted.

Pityriasis Alba
- Apply an appropriate topical corticosteroid twice daily for 2 to 3 weeks to treat any existing inflammation.
- Sun protection may be used to reduce the contrast between unaffected skin and affected skin.
- The patient and family should be counseled that several months might be required for typical pigmentation to return.

### Atopic dermatitis: diagnosis and treatment… [^113s1jyc]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Topical steroids should be applied twice daily until the lesions are significantly improved or less thick. Duration of topical steroid therapy is guided by clinical improvement but is typically two weeks or less. To minimize adverse effects, the lowest possible potency topical steroid should be used for the shortest possible period to maintain good symptom control. Research suggests using a proactive approach to reducing flare-ups with once- or twice-weekly application of topical steroids to specific skin areas that have been repeatedly affected. 30, 34 Topical calcineurin inhibitors are recommended for short- or long-term use and for maintenance therapy. The two available topical calcineurin inhibitors are tacrolimus and pimecrolimus. A meta-analysis of RCTs showed twice-weekly application of either medication increased the time between flare-ups and the total number of disease-free days.

Pimecrolimus is recommended for mild to moderate atopic dermatitis, whereas tacrolimus is indicated for moderate to severe disease. Overall, tacrolimus is more effective than pimecrolimus, but both reduce inflammation and pruritus. 36 A proactive maintenance approach of using tacrolimus twice weekly on areas prone to flare-ups reduces the rate of flare-ups and percentage of treatment days, and increases the time between flare-ups.
37. ULTRAVIOLET PHOTOTHERAPY AND SYSTEMIC IMMUNOMODULATORS Narrow band ultraviolet B phototherapy is an effective second-line treatment for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. 28 Phototherapy reduces cutaneous inflammation with minimal adverse effects. Short courses of ultraviolet A phototherapy, alone and with oral psoralen, can be safely used to treat flare-ups. Systemic immunomodulators, including cyclosporine and azathioprine, are off-label options if standard therapy is ineffective.

Systemic steroid use should be limited to severe flare-ups as short-term bridge therapy to other steroid-sparing options.
28. NEWER TREATMENT OPTIONS Crisaborole is a topical, steroid-sparing phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor that was FDA-approved in 2016 to treat mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in patients two years and older. A 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis showed that twice-daily application of crisaborole resolves lesions faster than topical controls.
