## Question

is celecoxib safe in chronic kidney disease

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether celecoxib is safe to use in chronic kidney disease and how to approach its use across CKD stages. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and mechanism of renal risk. Then, I should verify what high-credibility guidelines say by CKD stage. Next, I will review comparative safety data versus other NSAIDs, including PRECISION and related analyses. After that, I need to check dose, duration, and monitoring considerations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and note exceptions and alternatives, making sure I reconcile any conflicting data along the way.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism of renal risk, because if I get the mechanism wrong, the clinical advice will be off. Celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, reduces renal prostaglandin synthesis, which can blunt compensatory vasodilation in states of reduced renal perfusion, leading to hemodynamic AKI, sodium retention, and hyperkalemia; importantly, COX-2 is constitutively expressed in the kidney, so COX-2 selectivity does not eliminate nephrotoxicity, and risk is amplified in CKD where renal hemodynamics are already compromised [^52a2fc3a] [^3a8fe92c] [^723d82a7].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory baseline before moving to guidelines. The FDA labeling advises avoiding celecoxib in severe renal insufficiency and recommends close monitoring if used in patients with impaired renal function, reflecting dose-dependent renal risk and limited data in advanced CKD; this aligns with the mechanistic concern and sets the floor for practice [^6954ade0] [^db22a1ea].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidelines by CKD stage, because this will anchor the recommendation. The VA/DoD CKD guideline advises avoiding NSAIDs, including celecoxib, when eGFR is less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m², and to use extreme caution or avoid when eGFR is 30–59, especially with concomitant RAAS inhibitors, diuretics, SGLT2 inhibitors, or volume depletion; they also emphasize that NSAID-induced kidney injury is often reversible with prompt discontinuation and that alternatives should be prioritized when benefits are limited [^51ad493d] [^6c625853] [^2164e2e2]. KDIGO 2024 similarly stresses that people with CKD are more susceptible to nephrotoxic medications and that NSAIDs should be avoided when possible, with any use requiring a careful benefit–harm assessment and shared decision-making [^fb021426] [^84d31564].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about relative safety versus other NSAIDs; I need to check head-to-head data. In PRECISION, celecoxib at 100–200 mg twice daily was noninferior to naproxen and ibuprofen for major adverse cardiovascular events and had fewer GI events, with renal events lower than ibuprofen and similar to naproxen; importantly, patients with significant baseline renal impairment were largely excluded, so these results cannot be extrapolated to advanced CKD [^e0af12c3] [^23ecd5db]. A secondary analysis also found fewer major toxicities with celecoxib versus ibuprofen or naproxen, again in a population without advanced CKD, reinforcing that relative safety does not equal safety in CKD [^ecaa830b].

> I should double-check dose and duration, because these modify risk. Risk is dose- and duration-dependent; observational and meta-analytic data show increased AKI risk with NSAID exposure, with higher odds in older adults and those with CKD, and even short courses can increase risk, though topical NSAIDs carry lower systemic risk than oral agents; VA/DoD notes that topical diclofenac achieves very low systemic exposure and may be reasonable for localized OA pain when NSAIDs are otherwise unavoidable [^c703ab5e] [^5483d9d7] [^b713f9c8]. But wait, what if the patient truly needs an oral NSAID? If so, the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time with close monitoring is the principle, and celecoxib may be preferred over ibuprofen for GI and renal event profiles in non-CKD populations, though this does not negate CKD-specific risk [^e0af12c3] [^23ecd5db].

> Let me consider special populations and exceptions, because I need to ensure the advice is practical. In older adults, the Beers Criteria advise avoiding all non-aspirin NSAIDs in CKD, reflecting elevated risks of AKI, electrolyte disturbances, and progression; trauma and surgical guidance similarly caution against NSAIDs in stage 3 CKD and beyond, favoring acetaminophen or topical options when feasible [^86715e9e] [^38cb5897]. For acute gout in CKD, guidelines prefer colchicine or glucocorticoids over NSAIDs due to nephrotoxic risk, reserving NSAIDs only if alternatives are unsuitable and with careful monitoring [^ad5ebc0e] [^ec5628dd].

> I will now examine whether any subgroup or dose might be "safe enough" in CKD, and I should confirm that I'm not overstating. A small crossover trial in diabetic kidney disease did not show proteinuria reduction with celecoxib and reported few adverse events, but it was underpowered for safety and excluded advanced CKD, so it cannot justify routine use in CKD; likewise, CLASS-era analyses suggesting less renal toxicity with celecoxib versus comparators were in populations without advanced CKD and at supratherapeutic doses, limiting applicability [^636efb17] [^a2cef687]. Observational data linking NSAID use to CKD progression are confounded, but high cumulative exposure has been associated with faster eGFR decline, so chronic NSAID use in CKD remains concerning despite modest absolute risks in some cohorts [^69ac608b] [^947ddf8c].

> Let me synthesize a risk-stratified answer, and I should be explicit about uncertainty. Celecoxib is not safe in advanced CKD (eGFR < 30) and should be avoided; in mild to moderate CKD (eGFR 30–59), it is not categorically contraindicated but should generally be avoided unless benefits clearly outweigh risks, and if used, employ the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration with close monitoring of renal function and electrolytes, avoidance of interacting nephrohemodynamic drugs when possible, and a plan to stop if there is any decline in kidney function or rise in potassium; in eGFR ≥ 60 without other risk factors, short-term, moderate-dose celecoxib may be acceptable with routine monitoring, recognizing that NSAID risk is never zero [^51ad493d] [^2164e2e2] [^6954ade0]. I should confirm that shared decision-making is emphasized, because patient values and functional goals often drive whether a cautious NSAID trial is acceptable in the face of alternatives like acetaminophen, topical agents, or nonpharmacologic therapy [^fb021426] [^3b7639e3].

> Finally, I need to ensure practical monitoring and alternatives are clear. Before starting, check baseline eGFR, electrolytes, and blood pressure; reassess renal function and potassium within 1–2 weeks of initiation or dose change and periodically thereafter; educate patients to avoid OTC NSAIDs and report oliguria, edema, or weakness promptly; and consider topical NSAIDs for localized OA pain when systemic therapy is risky, acknowledging that even topical agents carry a small but nonzero AKI signal in older adults and CKD patients [^c703ab5e] [^b713f9c8]. If pain remains inadequately controlled and NSAIDs are unavoidable, a time-limited, closely monitored celecoxib trial at the lowest effective dose may be reasonable, but I should document the rationale, risks, and monitoring plan explicitly with the patient [^51ad493d] [^fb021426].

Celecoxib is **not safe for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD)** because it can cause acute kidney injury, worsen hypertension, and lead to electrolyte disturbances. It should be **avoided in advanced CKD (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²)** and used with extreme caution in mild to moderate CKD, only if benefits outweigh risks and with close monitoring. If NSAID therapy is necessary, prefer topical NSAIDs or acetaminophen, and use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration with regular renal function checks.

---

## Pharmacological considerations in CKD

Celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, reduces prostaglandin synthesis, which can impair renal perfusion — especially in CKD, where the kidneys rely on prostaglandins to maintain glomerular filtration. This mechanism underlies **increased risks of AKI, sodium retention, hypertension, and hyperkalemia** in CKD patients [^52a2fc3a] [^3a8fe92c].

---

## Clinical evidence of renal risks

Multiple studies and guidelines highlight **significant renal risks** with celecoxib in CKD:

- **Acute kidney injury (AKI)**: NSAIDs, including celecoxib, increase AKI risk, particularly in CKD patients [^704e57ef] [^431dbd49].
- **Progression of CKD**: Chronic NSAID use is associated with accelerated CKD progression, especially at high doses [^69ac608b] [^947ddf8c].
- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Celecoxib can cause hyperkalemia and sodium retention, exacerbating hypertension and edema [^52a2fc3a] [^6c625853].

---

## Comparative renal safety with other NSAIDs

Celecoxib was initially thought to have fewer renal effects than nonselective NSAIDs, but **evidence shows similar renal risks** in CKD patients [^3a8fe92c] [^57e68194]. The PRECISION trial found celecoxib had fewer renal events than ibuprofen but similar rates to naproxen, underscoring that celecoxib is not renoprotective [^e0af12c3] [^e5d5ca74].

---

## Guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines provide **clear recommendations** on celecoxib use in CKD:

| **Guideline/source** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| VA/DoD CKD guideline | - Avoid NSAIDs, including celecoxib, in patients with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² <br/> - Use caution in mild to moderate CKD; monitor renal function closely [^51ad493d] [^2164e2e2] |
| KDIGO 2024 | - People with CKD are more susceptible to nephrotoxic medications <br/> - Use non-nephrotoxic alternatives when possible; weigh benefits vs harms [^fb021426] [^84d31564] |
| Beers Criteria (2023) | - Avoid all NSAIDs, including celecoxib, in patients with CKD or chronic renal failure [^86715e9e] |

---

## Clinical scenarios and risk stratification

Celecoxib may be considered in CKD only when **benefits clearly outweigh risks**, such as:

- **Mild to moderate CKD (eGFR 30–59)**: Short-term use at the lowest effective dose with close monitoring may be acceptable in select cases [^notfound].
- **Advanced CKD (eGFR < 30)**: Avoid celecoxib due to high risk of AKI and disease progression [^51ad493d] [^7df15ec2].
- **High-risk patients**: Elderly, diabetics, heart failure, or those on RAAS inhibitors/diuretics have increased risk and should avoid celecoxib [^0ea6870c] [^51ad493d].

---

## Alternative analgesic strategies

Given the risks, **consider alternatives**:

- **Topical NSAIDs**: Lower systemic absorption and reduced renal risk; preferred for localized pain [^b713f9c8] [^5483d9d7].
- **Acetaminophen**: First-line for mild to moderate pain; avoid exceeding 3,000–4,000 mg/day.
- **Non-NSAID options**: Duloxetine, gabapentin, or tramadol may be considered for chronic pain, with caution regarding dosing and interactions [^86715e9e].

---

## Monitoring and precautions

If celecoxib is used in CKD, **strict monitoring is essential**:

- **Baseline assessment**: Renal function (eGFR, creatinine), electrolytes, and blood pressure [^143cd684].
- **Regular monitoring**: Recheck renal function and electrolytes within 1–2 weeks of initiation, then periodically.
- **Patient education**: Report oliguria, edema, fatigue, or muscle weakness promptly [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Avoid celecoxib in advanced CKD (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²)** [^51ad493d] [^7df15ec2].
- **Use caution in mild to moderate CKD (eGFR 30–59)**, only if benefits outweigh risks, at the lowest effective dose, and with close monitoring [^51ad493d] [^2164e2e2].
- **Prefer topical NSAIDs or acetaminophen** when possible [^b713f9c8] [^86715e9e].
- **Monitor renal function and electrolytes regularly** during therapy [^143cd684] [^51ad493d].

---

Celecoxib is **not safe for patients with CKD** due to risks of AKI, disease progression, and electrolyte disturbances. Use should be avoided in advanced CKD and approached with extreme caution in mild to moderate CKD, with alternatives preferred whenever possible.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the non-surgical management of hip&knee osteoarthritis [^e5d5ca74]. DoD/VA (2020). High credibility.

VA/DoD hip and knee osteoarthritis — renal safety with NSAIDs and CKD precautions: There were no differences in renal events between celecoxib and naproxen, but a lower rate of renal events occurred in the celecoxib group versus the ibuprofen group (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.44–0.85). The use of NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors should generally be avoided in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially in patients with an eGFR of ≤ 30 ml/min. However, in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) whose pain is not controlled with other non-NSAID treatments, potential risks and benefits of NSAIDs should be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Background

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are one of the most commonly prescribed medications, but they are associated with a number of serious adverse effects, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, kidney injury and GI complications.

Objective

To develop a set of multidisciplinary recommendations for the safe prescription of NSAIDs.

Methods

Randomised control trials and observational studies published before January 2018 were reviewed, with 329 papers included for the synthesis of evidence-based recommendations.

Results

Whenever possible, a NSAID should be avoided in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension, high risk of cardiovascular disease and severe chronic kidney disease (CKD). Before treatment with a NSAID is started, blood pressure should be measured, unrecognised CKD should be screened in high risk cases, and unexplained iron-deficiency anaemia should be investigated. For patients with high cardiovascular risk, and if NSAID treatment cannot be avoided, naproxen or celecoxib are preferred. For patients with a moderate risk of peptic ulcer disease, monotherapy with a non-selective NSAID plus a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), or a selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor should be used; for those with a high risk of peptic ulcer disease, a selective COX-2 inhibitor plus PPI are needed. For patients with pre-existing hypertension receiving renin-angiotensin system blockers, empirical addition (or increase in the dose) of an antihypertensive agent of a different class should be considered. Blood pressure and renal function should be monitored in most cases.

Conclusion

NSAIDs are a valuable armamentarium in clinical medicine, but appropriate recognition of high-risk cases, selection of a specific agent, choice of ulcer prophylaxis and monitoring after therapy are necessary to minimise the risk of adverse events.

### NSAIDs in CKD: are they safe? [^52a2fc3a]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The management of pain in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is challenging for many reasons. These patients have increased susceptibility to adverse drug effects due to altered drug metabolism and excretion, and there are limited safety data for use in this population despite a high pain burden. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have long been regarded as dangerous for use in patients with CKD because of their risk for nephrotoxicity and thus alternative classes of analgesics, including opioids, have become more commonly used for pain control in this population. Given the well-established risks that opioids and other analgesics pose, further characterization of the risk posed by NSAIDs in patients with CKD is warranted. NSAID use has been associated with acute kidney injury, progressive loss of glomerular filtration rate in CKD, electrolyte derangements, and hypervolemia with worsening of heart failure and hypertension. The risk for these nephrotoxicity syndromes is modified by many comorbid conditions, risk factors, and characteristics of use, and in patients with CKD, the risk differs between levels of glomerular filtration rate. In this review, we offer recommendations for the cautious use of NSAIDs in the CKD population after careful consideration of these risk factors on an individualized basis.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^6c625853]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

NSAIDs in chronic kidney disease — adverse effects and reversibility: NSAIDs may cause gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and kidney adverse events and, by blunting prostaglandin-associated regulation of renal hemodynamics, can induce renal ischemia. NSAIDs can also increase blood pressure, cause edema and sodium retention (mostly mild), induce hyperkalemia, and contribute to heart failure, and NSAID-induced kidney injury is typically reversible with prompt discontinuation.

NSAID safety in chronic kidney disease (CKD) emphasizes that concomitant use of multiple agents that affect kidney hemodynamics (e.g. RAASi, diuretics, SGLT2i, finerenone) as well as volume depletion may further increase the risk of NSAID-induced AKI; consider increasing frequency of eGFR monitoring with NSAID use, especially if prolonged or high-dose. Risks of NSAIDs are likely to outweigh benefits where there is evidence of little to no benefit (e.g., chronic primary musculoskeletal or wide-spread pain syndromes); determine meaningful functional targets for the patient, using SDM, prior to a trial of NSAID therapy, and proactively educate the patients on risks of NSAIDs, both OTC and prescribed, noting that patients may use OTC NSAIDs without discussion with a provider.

### The case for cautious consumption: NSAIDs in chronic kidney disease [^68e0c09c]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Strong epidemiological and pathologic evidence associates NSAIDs with kidney disease, both acute and chronic. Hence, the usage of NSAIDs has decreased in patients with, or at risk for, chronic kidney disease (CKD). Coupled with this has been a rise in use of opioids and other non-NSAID alternatives, which do come with significant, and underrecognized, risk of nonrenal adverse events. We review the literature to understand if this shift is appropriate or deleterious.

Recent Findings

NSAIDs do have a low but tangible risk in causing acute kidney injury, electrolyte imbalances, and increasing blood pressure. However, their role in causing progressive kidney disease is due to long-term usage in high cumulative dosages, and the use of NSAIDs in combination with other agents. Alternatives such as opioids, tramadol, gabapentin and baclofen have weak evidence to support their use and strong evidence to show their harm in patients with CKD.

Summary

Tradeoffs are inherent in using active pharmaceuticals, and NSAIDs are no exception. Balancing potential benefits with possible adverse effects around pain management should be a part of every conversation for patients with kidney disease.

Renal Risks

In addition to the GI and CV effects of NSAIDs, epidemiological and pathologic data also associate NSAID use with the potential for both acute and chronic kidney disease (CKD).–Renal side effects which include sodium and water retention with edema, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acute kidney injury may precipitate renal failure resulting in acute dialysis. Risk factors include older age, renal impairment, heart failure, liver disease, diabetes mellitus (DM), and concurrent prescription with antihypertensive drugs (eg, diuretics, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors). Again, mechanisms of NSAID-induced kidney damage relate to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis and are dose- and duration-dependent. Low levels of COX-2 are constitutively expressed in the macula densa, with COX-2 inhibition leading to a reduction in renal blood flow and resulting functional impairment. NSAIDs may also accumulate in renal tubular cells during secretion. While NSAID-induced sodium retention is COX-2-mediated, NSAID-induced reductions in glomerular filtration rate are mediated via COX-1.

Consistent with the dual COX-1/COX-2-dependent mechanisms, which predict the possibility of differences in renal toxicity for different NSAIDs, there are limited data to suggest clinically relevant differences. In the MEDAL program, etoricoxib had a greater risk of renovascular adverse events than diclofenac. In PRECISION, the risk of renal events was significantly lower with celecoxib compared with ibuprofen, and was similar for celecoxib compared with naproxen. In a meta-analysis, NSAIDs with high COX-2 selectivity had a lower association with acute kidney injury (AKI) compared to NSAIDs with low COX-2 selectivity. Overall, NSAIDs have a low but tangible risk in causing AKI, electrolyte imbalances and increased BP, but their role in progressive kidney disease is associated only with long-term use in high cumulative doses. In patients with CKD, withdrawal of NSAID use is recommended by nephrology consensus groups, but initiation of alternatives such as opioids conveys different and no less important drug-related concerns. In a study conducted in China that included age- and sex-matched controls of NSAID users, long-term (≥ 48 months) use of NSAIDs was independently associated with reduced renal function. It is recommended that patients with risk factors for renal impairment have preventative strategies in place that include using the lowest effective NSAID dose for the shortest possible time, as well as monitoring renal function, fluid retention and electrolyte abnormalities. The concomitant use of NSAIDs and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should be avoided.

### Safety of celecoxib versus traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in older patients with arthritis [^ed16e481]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Study outcomes

The primary outcome was the incidence and risk of GI bleeding in celecoxib-treated patients vs traditional NSAIDs-treated patients, stratified by differential treatment duration to account for the cumulative effect of prolonged therapy. The endpoint event was captured via healthcare visit episodes for GI bleeding, and subsequently between-group differences in GI bleeding risk were assessed. To better evaluate the sole effects of celecoxib vs traditional COX inhibitors on GI complications, a subgroup analysis was designed, where only those patients with no upper GI prophylaxis based on PPIs or H2RAs were selected for risk analysis. The secondary CV disease outcome was a composite of hospital encounter with a primary diagnosis of ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction, chronic ischemic heart disease, and heart failure. Hospital visit episodes for coronary revascularization, identified with procedure codes for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent implantation and for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), along with any visit episodes for incident renal events (hypertensive renal disease, nephritic syndrome, chronic kidney disease, kidney failure, renal dialysis, and disorders resulting from impaired renal tubular function), were also captured for additional secondary outcome analysis.

Statistical analysis

A multivariable logistic regression model incorporating all baseline variables (age category, sex, primary arthritis diagnosis, comorbidity, and medications use history) as covariates was employed to yield a propensity score (PS) value for individual patients, which predicts the probability of patient exposure to celecoxib vs traditional NSAIDs in the setting of the pretreatment characteristics. Study patients were then PS-matched to celecoxib or traditional NSAIDs in a 1:1 ratio to balance baseline covariates (or potential confounders) between the two cohorts. Then, odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for adverse GI, CV, and renal endpoint events associated with study therapy exposure were estimated. The PS-matched patients in the two comparison groups were further stratified by treatment duration into the following three strata: 30–59 days, 60–119 days, and 120 or more days. P -values were two-tailed and considered to be statistically significant if less than 0.05. Maintenance daily doses of commonly prescribed study agents were also assessed for descriptive purposes. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC).

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline summary management of osteoarthritis of the hip [^f80aff85]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2024). High credibility.

Pharmacological management: NSAIDs — "When not contraindicated, oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) should be used to reduce pain and improve function in the treatment of symptomatic hip osteoarthritis," with "Quality of Evidence: High" and "Strength of Recommendation: Strong." The guideline rationale states "Five studies (three moderate quality and two high quality) compared oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) with placebo for treatment of symptomatic osteoarthritis of the hip and showed improvement in pain and function scores," that "Compared to placebo, all five studies reported on pain and uniformly reported improvement in pain with the use of oral NSAIDs," and that "The Western Ontario McMaster Arthritis Index (WOMAC) score was reported in all studies, all of which reported improvement in WOMAC function with NSAIDs compared to placebo." Head-to-head articles reported "lumiracoxib showed similar efficacy to celecoxib," "celecoxib 200mg/day and 400mg/day showed similar efficacy to naproxen," and "similar efficacy between valdecoxib 10mg and naproxen." Under benefits/harm, "Contraindications that should be considered include, but are not limited to, patients with chronic kidney disease or patients with significant cardiac conditions that may be at an elevated risk of myocardial infarction." Outcome importance notes "The use of non-opioid medications such as NSAIDs for nonoperative treatment of symptomatic osteoarthritis of the hip is extremely important to minimize the use of opioids." Cost/resource statements note NSAIDs are "widely available and an extremely cost-effective treatment" but "there is limited comparative data on the cost-effectiveness of oral NSAIDs compared to other nonoperative treatments of osteoarthritis of the hip." For implementation, "This recommendation should be readily implemented as it does not influence a major change in clinical practice" and "Oral NSAIDs are widely available. Thus, this recommendation should be easily implemented with no apparent barriers to adoption."

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^b713f9c8]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Topical NSAIDs versus systemic NSAIDs — recommendation and renal safety data: Topical NSAIDs are recommended for use in knee osteoarthritis based on evidence of equivalent efficacy for improving pain and function and superior systemic adverse effect profiles compared to oral NSAIDs. Multiple meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials indicate adverse effects of topical NSAIDs are similar to placebo except for increased local adverse effects, mostly mild skin reactions. Diclofenac is a topical NSAID approved in the U.S. for osteoarthritis, and in a pooled safety analysis of 7 RCTs of topical diclofenac 1.5% use, among 138 patients using topical diclofenac for 4–12 weeks, no patients experienced a serious kidney adverse event; changes in blood pressure and kidney function were similar between the diclofenac and placebo/control groups. Studies with topical diclofenac also report that the level attained in blood is 0.4–2.2% of the maximum serum.

### Renal effects of cyclooxygyenase-2-selective inhibitors [^24ba0b8a]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2002). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used. These agents are associated with adverse renal effects caused by the reduction in synthesis of renal prostaglandins through inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX). Both isoforms of COX, COX-1 and COX-2, are expressed in the kidney in constitutive and inducible forms. It is assumed therefore that the COX-2-selective inhibitors, rofecoxib and celecoxib, would have an effect on renal function similar to that of nonselective NSAIDs. Several studies have evaluated this issue, although they have different study models and some have design flaws that limit their interpretation. Therefore, conclusions should be based on the pattern of observed effects rather than on individual data. These studies suggest that both celecoxib and rofecoxib can cause sodium retention and decrease glomerular filtration rate (GFR) to a similar extent as nonselective NSAIDs in patients at risk for adverse renal effects. Consequently, the same precautions regarding renal risk that are followed for nonselective NSAIDs should be used when selective COX-2 inhibitors are administered.

### Celecoxib (celecoxib 200 mg) [^6954ade0]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

5.5 Hepatic Effects

Borderline elevations of one or more liver-associated enzymes may occur in up to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs, and notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately 3 or more times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials with NSAIDs. These laboratory abnormalities may progress, may remain unchanged, or may be transient with continuing therapy. Rare cases of severe hepatic reactions, including jaundice and fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis and hepatic failure (some with fatal outcome) have been reported with NSAIDs, including celecoxib [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In controlled clinical trials of celecoxib, the incidence of borderline elevations (greater than or equal to 1.2 times and less than 3 times the upper limit of normal) of liver associated enzymes was 6% for celecoxib and 5% for placebo, and approximately 0.2% of patients taking celecoxib and 0.3% of patients taking placebo had notable elevations of ALT and AST.

A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be monitored carefully for evidence of the development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with celecoxib. If clinical signs and symptoms

consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), celecoxib should be discontinued.

5.6 Renal Effects

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of

an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver

dysfunction, those taking diuretics, ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state. Clinical trials with celecoxib have shown renal effects similar to those observed with comparator NSAIDs.

No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of celecoxib in patients with advanced renal disease. Therefore, treatment with celecoxib is not recommended in these patients with advanced renal disease. If celecoxib therapy must be initiated, close monitoring of the patient's renal function is advisable.

### COX-2 inhibitors and the kidney [^f64e53ef]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective inhibitors are now extensively used for their anti-inflammatory and analgesic efficacy. Several large controlled trials provide evidence to support the proposition that they cause fewer major gastro-intestinal side effects and less toxicity than routine nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In view of the documented different localizations of the cyclooxygenase-1 and COX-2 enzymes in the kidney, it was initially hoped that COX-2 inhibitors would be associated with fewer renal side effects than other NSAIDs. This has not been borne out by subsequent studies. Like other NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors can cause salt and water retention, leading to edema and worsening hypertension. They can also cause acute declines in renal function and glomerular filtration rate. These events are, however, uncommon in large rheumatology populations and infrequently lead to discontinuation of the medications. Judicious use of COX-2 inhibitors in high-risk patients (such as those with chronic renal insufficiency, diabetes or congestive heart failure) will lead to a decreased incidence of adverse renal events.

Table 4 summarizes the results of incidence rates and comparative risk of secondary endpoints of the prespecified CV and renal events among the PS-matched study patients with therapy duration of at least 120 days; the ORs associated with each component of CV composite endpoint were also presented. Overall, celecoxib users showed an elevated risk of hospital encounter for CV diseases as well as renal events compared with traditional NSAID users: the ORs (95% CIs) were 1.08 (1.04–1.12) and 1.22 (1.11–1.35), respectively. The risk of CV diseases showed only a near-significant trend when therapy duration of at least 30 days (or all three strata) was assessed collectively for risk analysis (OR = 1.02%, 95% CI = 1.00–1.04, P = 0.07). However, in the stratum of 120 days and more of treatment, statistical significance was reached (OR = 1.08%, 95% CI = 1.04–1.12, P < 0.001), suggesting more negative CV effects of celecoxib vs traditional NSAIDs as therapy persisted longer; when individual components of CV disease endpoint were assessed separately, the odds of hospital encounter due to unstable angina, chronic ischemic heart disease, and heart failure were higher in celecoxib-receiving patients than in traditional NSAIDs-receiving patients: the ORs (95% CIs) were 1.10 (1.05–1.15), 0.10 (1.02–1.19), and 1.09 (1.03–1.16), respectively. However, the risk of hospitalization for coronary revascularization was not significantly different between the two cohorts (P = 0.34). Due to the low rates of CABG, albeit numerically more frequent in the celecoxib group than in the traditional NSAIDs group, its OR results are not presented in Table 4.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug induced acute kidney injury in the community dwelling general population and people with chronic kidney disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^8cf61b5e]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly prescribed in primary care for their analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects. One in fifteen US adults are actively prescribed NSAIDs at any one time, and in many countries low-dose preparations are also available over-the-counter (OCT). Partly due to their widespread use, NSAIDs account for 25% of adverse drug events (ADEs) reported in the United Kingdom ﻿﻿(UK) and 21% in the United States (US). NSAIDs are also commonly implicated in hospital admissions due to ADEs, including those which are fatal, but gastrointestinal and cardiac toxicity are better quantified than renal toxicity.

NSAIDs can reduce renal blood flow, cause tubular obstruction through crystal deposition, and induce direct cytotoxicity and cell-mediated immune injury mechanisms leading to the occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI). Another symptom that is commonly caused by NSAIDs is interstitial nephritis (AIN) which requires specialist review, renal biopsy, high-dose corticosteroid and/or immunosuppressant treatments, and will normally be progression in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Older age and underlying chronic kidney disease are also related to the onset of AKI during NSAID use, with early studies showing that the risk of deterioration in renal function increases 3–4 fold in patients with abnormal baseline renal function compared to those with normal renal function. Notably, NSAIDs are commonly prescribed to people with CKD, despite guidance to avoid them in this population. In US veterans in 2005, 15.4% of people with CKD were prescribed traditional NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors, compared to 11.1% of people with CKD in the UK in 2012, and 15.9% of people with CKD in Australia in 2004–2006. Better quantification of risk in people with CKD is therefore of particular clinical interest, as is whether NSAID risk varies by age and by COX-2 selectivity. In terms of COX-2 selectivity, early studies suggested that COX-2-selective inhibitors caused fewer renal adverse effects including reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), increased serum creatinine (SCr) and hypertension. Other studies have shown no significant differences in renal risk between COX-2-selective inhibitors and nonselective NSAIDs.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^aedf28ca]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

VA/DoD low back pain — NSAID selection and safety — Most comparative trials between NSAIDs showed no significant differences in pain relief, and an SR comparing cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) NSAIDs with traditional NSAIDs reported no statistically significant difference for pain relief for acute low back pain in four studies and no differences for chronic LBP in a fifth. A large noninferiority trial randomized 24,081 patients to celecoxib, naproxen, or ibuprofen and found the cardiovascular (CV) risk associated with celecoxib was noninferior to the non-selective NSAIDs; limitations included drug discontinuation 68.8%, study dropout 27.4%, most patients 90% had OA, and a dose of celecoxib limited to 200 mg/day with dose escalation allowed for ibuprofen and naproxen. All NSAIDs have a black box warning for increased risk of CV and gastrointestinal (GI) events; if an NSAID is required in a patient with CV risk, naproxen may be a viable option; the use of relatively selective COX-2 inhibitors reduces the risk for GI events, but this benefit is negated if the patient is using aspirin; NSAIDs can also exacerbate heart failure and worsen hypertension and renal function and must be used cautiously or avoided in patients with renal impairment or in elderly patients.

### Renal effects of COX-2-selective inhibitors [^3a8fe92c]. American Journal of Nephrology (2001). Low credibility.

Although nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) effectively treat a variety of inflammatory diseases, these agents may cause deleterious effects on kidney function, especially with respect to solute homeostasis and maintenance of renal perfusion and glomerular filtration. NSAIDs act by reducing prostaglandin biosynthesis through inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) which exists as two isoforms (COX-1 and COX-2). NSAID-induced gastrointestinal toxicity is generally believed to occur through blockade of COX-1 activity, whereas the anti-inflammatory effects of NSAIDs are thought to occur primarily through inhibition of the inducible isoform, COX-2. However, the situation in the kidney may be somewhat different. Recent studies have demonstrated that COX-2 is constitutively expressed in renal tissues of all species; this isoform may, therefore, be intimately involved in prostaglandin-dependent renal homeostatic processes. Drugs that selectively inhibit COX-2 might, therefore, be expected to produce effects on renal function similar to nonselective NSAIDs which inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2. This assertion is borne out by recent clinical studies showing that the COX-2 inhibitors rofecoxib and celecoxib procedure qualitative changes in urinary prostaglandin excretion, glomerular filtration rate, sodium retention, and their consequences similar to nonselective NSAIDs. It, therefore, seems unlikely that these COX-2 inhibitors (and perhaps their successors) will offer renal safety benefits over nonselective NSAID therapies, and, at this juncture, it is reasonable to assume that all NSAIDs, including COX-2-selective inhibitors, share a similar risk for adverse renal effects.

### Specific cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors: what have we learned since they came into widespread clinical use? [^a4b9897a]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Specific inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2 were introduced into widespread clinical use in 1999. Since that time, celecoxib and rofecoxib have become two of the most commonly prescribed medications in the United States. Clinical trials using these medications for arthritis and pain have uniformly demonstrated efficacy superior to that of placebo and similar to that of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. However, controversy surrounding the proper place of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors in the hierarchy of treatment for arthritis continues, based primarily on their higher cost compared with that of acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. A decreased risk of gastrointestinal toxicity remains the primary justification for using the more expensive cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors in preference to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The renal and cardiovascular effects of rofecoxib and celecoxib have been investigated in relation to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and to one another. The data with respect to alteration in renal function, lower extremity edema, and hypertension indicates that cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors affect the kidney in a manner similar to that of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The data comparing the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors is difficult to interpret because it is not clear that comparable doses have been used in clinical trials. The potential thrombogenic risk of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors remains controversial, and conflicting data exist. It remains important to increase our understanding of the place of these agents in clinical practice from the perspective of efficacy, toxicity, and cost.

### A randomized trial of a 6-week course of celecoxib on proteinuria in diabetic kidney disease [^636efb17]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Preclinical data suggest that cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors decrease proteinuria and preserve glomerular structure in animal models of diabetic nephropathy. The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of celecoxib with placebo for decreasing proteinuria in patients with diabetic nephropathy.

Study Design

Placebo-controlled double-blinded crossover design.

Setting & Participants

24 patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus, proteinuria with protein of 500 mg/d or greater, and serum creatinine level of 3.0 mg/dL or less.

Intervention

Patients were randomly assigned to: (1) 6 weeks of celecoxib followed by a 3-week washout period, followed by 6 weeks of placebo followed by another 3-week washout; or (2) 6 weeks of placebo followed by a 3-week washout, followed by 6 weeks of celecoxib followed by another 3-week washout period. All patients were administered quinapril, 20 to 40 mg/d, or irbesartan, 150 to 300 mg/d. All patients were administered aspirin, 81 mg/d.

Outcomes & Measurements

Proteinuria was assessed by means of protein-creatinine ratio. Data were analyzed using the mixed-effect statistical model.

Results

There was no significant difference in urinary proteinuria after 6 weeks of treatment with placebo or celecoxib (proteinuria ratio, celecoxib versus placebo, 1.041; 95% confidence interval, 0.846 to 1.282). Celecoxib had no significant effect on potassium or estimated glomerular filtration rate. Frequencies of adverse events were similar between the placebo and celecoxib treatments.

Limitations

This pilot study was not designed to evaluate the safety or long-term clinical effects of celecoxib.

Conclusions

Celecoxib, 200 mg/d, for 6 weeks did not alter proteinuria. Few adverse events were noted in this high-risk population.

### Safety of celecoxib versus traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in older patients with arthritis [^df06b146]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Celecoxib was associated with decreased risk of GI bleeding compared with traditional NSAIDs when treatment lasted for 120 days and more, but such a relationship was not found in sub-group patients with no concomitant use of PPIs or H2RAs. CV and renal risks were higher with celecoxib than with traditional NSAIDs, and a dose-dependent risk relationship was suggested among celecoxib-treated patients.

### COX-2 inhibitors. are they nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with a better safety profile? [^ba075fda]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

In the treatment of arthritis, NSAIDs are some of the most commonly used drugs, although the prescription of such drugs has been questioned due to their inherent risks for gastrointestinal compromise, platelet effects, and the potential for renal toxicity with long-term use. With the availability of celecoxib and rofecoxib, 2 cyclooxygenase (COX-2) inhibitors (or COX-1 sparing agents) as new forms of NSAIDs, these issues have become magnified not only in the context of risk-to-benefit ratios but also interms of pharmacoeconomics because they have been proven to be equally efficacious as the nonselective NSAIDs, with an improved safety profile particularly within the gastrointestinal tract, but at a significantly increased cost.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug induced acute kidney injury in the community dwelling general population and people with chronic kidney disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^704e57ef]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

The results of the meta-analysis showed that current exposure to NSAIDs was associated with an approximately 1.5-fold increase in the odds of developing AKI in the general population and in people with CKD. Since AKI is a rare NSAIDs associated adverse outcome, odds ratios will approximate to relative risks. There was considerable heterogeneity between studies, particularly in the general population group and so the pooled estimates should be interpreted with caution. The limited numbers of studies eligible for inclusion precluded meta-regression, so subgroup analyses were conducted in order to try to explore and explain heterogeneity. Results were consistent with and similar to the main findings. Older people who were prescribed NSAIDs had a somewhat higher (2-fold) risk of developing AKI, but there was no strong evidence that greater COX-2 selectivity was associated with lower AKI risk. NSAIDs with high COX-2 selectivity (≥ 5-fold) had a lower association with AKI than NSAIDs with COX-2 selectivity < 5-fold, and heterogeneity in the subgroups was reduced compared to the overall results consistent with some of the heterogeneity being due to differences in the age of the population studies and the type of NSAIDs examined. Five studies included individual NSAID usage in their analyses in which only Lafrance and Schneider compared dose effect in Rofecoxib, Celecoxib, Naproxen and Meloxicam (Lafrance only). Dose response cannot be easily stratified as higher dosage will be associated with a higher risk of effect compared to lower dosage but the exposure window is not under control. However, other differences in population and in AKI definition were substantial and likely accounts for much of the observed heterogeneity. Overall, all analyses showed a statistically significant, modestly increased risk of AKI from exposure to NSAIDs, and the magnitude of the increased risk of AKI was rather similar among all sub-groups with mostly overlapping confidence intervals.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and chronic kidney disease progression: a systematic review [^947ddf8c]. Family Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely regarded as one risk factor, which influences chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression. However, previous literature reviews have not quantified the risk in moderate to severe CKD patients.

Objective

To estimate the strength of association between chronic NSAID use and CKD progression.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational general practice or population studies featuring patients aged 45 years and over. The electronic databases searched were MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, AMED, BNI and CINAHL until September 2011 without date or language restrictions. Searches included the reference lists of relevant identified studies, WEB of KNOWLEDGE, openSIGLE, specific journals, the British Library and expert networks. For relevant studies, random effects meta-analysis was used to estimate the association between NSAID use and accelerated CKD progression (estimated glomerular filtration rate decline ≥ 15 ml/min/1.73 m2).

Results

From a possible 768 articles, after screening and selection, seven studies were identified (5 cohort, 1 case-control and 1 cross-sectional) and three were included in the meta-analysis. Regular-dose NSAID use did not significantly affect the risk of accelerated CKD progression; pooled odds ratio (OR) = 0.96 (95%CI: 0.86–1.07), but high-dose NSAID use significantly increased the risk of accelerated CKD progression; pooled OR = 1.26 (95%CI: 1.06–1.50).

Conclusions

The avoidance of NSAIDs in the medium term is unnecessary in patients with moderate to severe CKD, if not otherwise contraindicated. As the definition of high-dose of NSAID use remains unclear, the lowest effective dose of NSAIDs should be prescribed where indicated.

### Safety of celecoxib versus traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in older patients with arthritis [^1d518fa5]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

The dose-dependent relationship between GI/CV/renal adverse consequences and celecoxib exposure was also confirmed in the additional analysis (Table 5). The findings from the PRECISION trial did not provide evidence on the safety of high-dose celecoxib because only moderate doses (up to 200 mg/day for osteoarthritis patients and up to 400 mg/day for rheumatoid arthritis patients) were provided for study participants. Given that older patients requiring daily pain and inflammation management are at a greater risk of CV and renal toxicities owing to the chronic exposure to COX inhibitors, it is of significant importance that upward dosing titration for celecoxib should be strictly restricted by regulatory actions as in the US and Europe to moderate doses up to 200 mg/day in most cases, but up to 400 mg/day in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Older patients with arthritis suffering from mild-to-moderate pain may benefit from receiving a carefully designed combination regimen with dual oral analgesics (eg, celecoxib combined with acetaminophen), such that celecoxib doses can be reduced and that intermittent drug holidays can be implemented when appropriate.

Notably, it appeared that a sizable proportion of older patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis in the current study were receiving more than the maximum approved or recommended doses of celecoxib for their indications. Daily therapy with high-dose celecoxib in the long-term can render those patients with multiple comorbidities and risk factors along with already decreased renal function more vulnerable to its potential CV and renal toxicity. Although growing evidence showed that the safety profile of celecoxib at moderate doses is generally comparable to that of NSAIDs, more research designed to account for potential confounding due to concomitant use of gastroprotective drugs and to address potential limitations of controlled clinical trials is needed to ascertain whether celecoxib's GI benefits would outweigh its other possible risks with regard to CV and renal complications as compared to traditional NSAIDs.

This study has several limitations. First, any patients in long-standing remission who did not require medical attention in 2016 might not have been identified as rheumatoid arthritis patients. Second, information on relevant laboratory findings regarding metabolic functions and potential confounders, such as overall health status of study patients and severity of condition, was not available in the claims data. Third, any diagnostic codes or prescription data not documented correctly could have affected the study results. Fourth, it was assumed that the whole course of therapy was completed as prescribed, despite potential non-compliance in older patients. Lastly, CV outcomes that require longer follow-up were not captured due to the limited study period.

### Hyperuricemia and diabetes mellitus when occurred together have higher risks than alone on all-cause mortality and end-stage renal disease in patients with chronic kidney disease [^a5c21f01]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyperuricemia was also a risk equivalent to DM for ESKD in this CKD cohort in Taiwan, which has the highest incidence of ESKD worldwide. In addition to potential mechanisms that hyperuricemia contributes to CKD progression by reducing renal perfusion via stimulated proliferation of afferent arteriolar vascular smooth muscle cells, and the over-use of NSAID for gout attack also threatened CKD progression. Once gout attack, patients got used to taking NSAIDs for pain relief even if definite evidence of renal toxicity of NSAIDs. From a Nationwide study in Taiwan (109,400 incident chronic ESKD patients from 1998 to 2009), adjusted odds ratio (OR) was 2.73 (95% CI: 2.62–2.84) for nonselective NSAIDs and 2.17 (95% CI: 1.83–2.57) for celecoxib. Compared with the non-users, users of oral NSAID were 3.74 times more likely to develop dialysis-required ESKD. This severe renal risk could be even greater for people who had recently used the parenteral form of NSAIDs (adjusted OR: 8.66). About 30% dialytic patients still took NSAID 1 year before the initiation of dialysis (2018 Annual Report on Kidney Disease, Taiwan). Moreover, the number of patients taking NSAID was likely under-estimated because its over-the-counter availability in Taiwan.

### Patient benefit-risk in arthritis – a rheumatologist's perspective [^b48d5328]. Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Renal risk

Both non-selective NSAIDs and Cox-2 selective inhibitors are associated with nephrotoxicity, which can range from fluid and electrolyte disturbances to overt renal dysfunction, renal papillary necrosis or nephrotic syndrome. As a result, current guidelines recommend that NSAIDs should not be used in patients with severe renal insufficiency, and that caution is necessary in patients with hypertension, congestive heart failure, mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency or other conditions associated with decreased intravascular volume oedema.

Although the renal adverse effects of non-selective NSAIDs have been well characterized, the risk associated with Cox-2 selective inhibitors is less well documented. Zhang et al. investigated the RRs of renal adverse events associated with rofecoxib or celecoxib in a meta-analysis of 114 clinical trials, involving 116 094 patients, of whom 6394 (5.5%) had peripheral oedema, hypertension or renal dysfunction. The RRs for renal dysfunction or peripheral oedema in patients treated with rofecoxib were 2.31 (95% CI 1.05, 5.07) and 1.43 (95% CI 1.23, 1.66), respectively; in contrast, celecoxib was associated with a lower risk of renal adverse events, with RRs for renal dysfunction and peripheral oedema of 0.61 (95% CI 0.40, 0.94) and 1.09 (95% CI 0.91, 1.31), respectively. The risk of renal adverse events associated with rofecoxib increased with both dose and duration of treatment. These findings suggest that there does not appear to be a class effect in terms of renal adverse events with Cox-2 selective inhibitors. The same caution is needed for all non-selective NSAIDs as well as for all Cox-2 selective inhibitors.

### Celecoxib clinical profile [^661bdca0]. Rheumatology (2000). Low credibility.

Celecoxib is the first COX-2-specific inhibitor approved for relief of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), as well as for treatment of familial adenomatous polyposis. For both OA and RA, celecoxib has been shown to be significantly superior in efficacy to placebo and similar in efficacy to traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Its advantage, however, is its gastrointestinal (GI) safety. Randomized clinical trials as well as long-term outcomes studies have demonstrated that the GI safety profile of celecoxib is superior to that of traditional NSAIDs and similar to that of placebo. Additionally, the renal and cardiovascular safety of celecoxib has also become apparent, as well as its efficacy, tolerability and safety in the elderly population.

Maintenance dose of celecoxib and traditional NSAIDs

The maintenance doses of celecoxib and commonly used oral traditional NSAID agents (loxoprofen, dexibuprofen, ibuprofen, and naproxen) were assessed using descriptive statistics and are visually depicted in Figure 1. Here, all relevant prescriptions with therapy duration of at least 30 days were included for assessment. The interquartile range of maintenance dosage of the five agents appeared to fall within the upper limits of the recommended daily dose for their anti-inflammatory properties. Of all the COX inhibitors included in this study, the most commonly-used agent per prescription volume was loxoprofen, followed by celecoxib (31.6% and 12.4%, respectively, as shown in Table S1): the median dose (interquartile range) was 180 mg/day (180–180 mg/day) and 200 mg/day (200–400 mg/day), respectively. About 4.7% (350/73,748) of patients on celecoxib treatment received a total daily dose of greater than 400 mg (the maximum daily dose); of those, 71.4% (250/350) of patients had osteoarthritis, with no comorbidity history of rheumatoid arthritis. Among the osteoarthritis-only patients on celecoxib, about 24.3% (14,309/58,794) patients were prescribed with a daily dose of more than 200 mg/day (the maximum daily dose recommended for osteoarthritis patients).

In an additional analysis on comparative risk associated with high-dose (more than 400 mg/day) vs low-to-moderate-dose (less than or equal to 400 mg/day) celecoxib among those patients on celecoxib for at least 30 days, high-dose receiving patients were more likely to encounter GI bleeding, a composite endpoint of CV diseases, and renal events relative to those receiving a low-to-moderate dose of celecoxib: the ORs (95% CIs) were 2.77 (1.47–5.22), 1.44 (1.17–1.78), and 1.97 (1.28–3.05), respectively (Table 5).

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the non-surgical management of hip&knee osteoarthritis [^0a6d8e28]. DoD/VA (2020). High credibility.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and risk of renal disease: Use of non‑selective or COX‑2 selective NSAIDs can result in renal papillary necrosis, acute tubular necrosis, acute interstitial nephritis with or without nephrotic syndrome, renal insufficiency, fluid and electrolyte disturbances, acute renal failure, or other renal‑related injuries in an estimated 1–5% of patients, and all available agents approved for use in the U.S. include a warning for such events in their prescribing information. The risk for renal adverse events increases in patients who are dependent upon a compensatory increase in renal prostaglandins to maintain renal perfusion, and patients at higher risk include those with preexisting renal disease, volume depletion (e.g., diuretics, vomiting), congestive heart failure, liver dysfunction, cirrhosis with ascites, use of angiotensin‑converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and older patients. In healthy patients, renal prostaglandins do not play a significant role in maintaining renal perfusion; however, in reduced volume, hypotension, and reduced renal perfusion, NSAID administration reduces compensatory vasodilatory renal prostaglandins, which can result in reduced renal perfusion and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and can lead to renal damage. Although other mechanisms exist, hemodynamically mediated acute renal insufficiency is the most common cause and is most frequently reversible once the offending agent is discontinued. In the PRECISION study, renal events were prospectively monitored in more than 20,000 RA or OA patients receiving celecoxib, ibuprofen, or naproxen for a mean follow‑up of 20 months, and eligible patients had baseline serum creatinine values within normal limits.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the total number of patients who received celecoxib in pre-approval clinical trials, more than 3,300 were 65 to 74 years of age, while approximately 1,300 additional patients were 75 years and over. No substantial differences in effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. In clinical studies comparing renal function as measured by the GFR, BUN and creatinine, and platelet function as measured by bleeding time and platelet aggregation, the results were not different between elderly and young volunteers. However, as with other NSAIDs, including those that selectively inhibit COX-2, there have been more spontaneous post-marketing reports of fatal GI events and acute renal failure in the elderly than in younger patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.6)].

8.6 Hepatic Insufficiency

The daily recommended dose of celecoxib capsules in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) should be reduced by 50%. The use of celecoxib in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 Renal Insufficiency

Celecoxib is not recommended in patients with severe renal insufficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.8 Poor Metabolizers of CYP2C9 Substrates

Patients who are known or suspected to be poor CYP2C9 metabolizers based on genotype or previous history/experience with other CYP2C9 substrates (such as warfarin, phenytoin) should be administered celecoxib with caution. Consider starting treatment at half the lowest recommended dose in poor metabolizers (i.e. CYP2C9*3/*3). Alternative management should be considered in JRA patients identified to be CYP2C9 poor metabolizers [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].

### How celecoxib could be safer, how valdecoxib might have been [^0684659d]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Following the actions of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April 2005, celecoxib became the only generally available cyclooxygenase-2 inhibiting antiinflammatory drug. The FDA instituted new precautions regarding the use of celecoxib and encouraged the use of "the lowest effective dose". This dose, as defined by the FDA and the package insert, is 200 mg/day for all patients; 200 mg/day of celecoxib is a strong dosage, equivalent to naproxen 500 mg twice daily. However, many patients receiving naproxen benefit from much lower, safer dosages. With celecoxib, studies have shown that a 50% lower dosage is effective and causes fewer adverse effects. Because nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug-related events involving the gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiovascular systems are dose-related, it is essential to define the very lowest effective dosages of celecoxib and to make these dosages available for use. This article discusses the increasing trend of drug companies to market new drugs with one-size-fits-all or limited dosages, thereby making it difficult or impossible to individualize treatment based on patients' age, size, state of health, or use of concomitant medications. Imagine if naproxen had been marketed only at 500 mg twice daily or ibuprofen at 800 mg 4 times daily. Flexible, individualized dosing is required to provide optimal therapeutics. If celecoxib and valdecoxib had been marketed with a range of doses, many serious adverse effects might have been avoided. The marketing of strong, one-size-fits-all dosages places patients, physicians, and even manufacturers at unnecessary risk of unwanted events.

8.8 Poor Metabolizers of CYP2C9 Substrates

Patients who are known or suspected to be poor CYP2C9 metabolizers based on genotype or previous history/experience with other CYP2C9 substrates (such as warfarin, phenytoin) should be administered celecoxib with caution. Consider starting treatment at half the lowest recommended dose in poor metabolizers (i.e. CYP2C9*3/*3). Alternative management should be considered in JRA patients identified to be CYP2C9 poor metabolizers [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].

### Gastrointestinal toxicity with celecoxib vs nonsteroidal anti… [^b59f4ad0]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

Objective To determine whether celecoxib, a COX-2–specific inhibitor, is associated with a lower incidence of significant upper GI toxic effects and other adverse effects compared with conventional NSAIDs. Design The Celecoxib Long-term Arthritis Safety Study, a double-blind, randomized controlled trial conducted from September 1998 to March 2000. RR for celecoxib compared with NSAIDs was 0.

1. 36%. and 10 events, respectively), and coronary artery disease. No serious rashes or unexpected serious adverse events were observed in patients taking celecoxib. The overall incidence of GI symptoms experienced by patients taking celecoxib was significantly lower than by those taking NSAIDs, as was the.

elevations were also higher in patients receiving NSAIDs. Overall, 97% of ALT and AST abnormalities occurred in patients receiving diclofenac. The overall incidence of renal adverse effects, and the incidence of increased creatinine and hypertension in particular, were significantly lower in patients receiving celecoxib than in those receiving NSAIDs. Also, significantly more patients receiving NSAIDs exhibited. of clinically significant decreases in hemoglobin and/or hematocrit compared with NSAID-treated patients, even when patients with upper GI ulcer complications, symptomatic ulcers, and other GI diseases were excluded. Celecoxib was also better tolerated than NSAIDs, as evidenced by the decreased incidence of GI symptoms and withdrawals for such symptoms. The clinical consequences of NSAIDs on kidneys are heterogeneous, and, at present, the relative importance of COX-1 and COX-2 in the human kidney is not well defined.

36 Regardless, celecoxib appeared to be associated with significantly less renal toxicity compared with NSAID therapy in this study. Although.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the non-surgical management of hip&knee osteoarthritis [^c5164a19]. DoD/VA (2020). High credibility.

Non-surgical management of hip & knee osteoarthritis — clinical summary and recommendation state that the evidence supports a clinically significant reduction in pain with NSAIDs and a lesser overall effect of reducing pain with acetaminophen in patients with OA of the hip or knee; the superiority of NSAIDs over acetaminophen was more apparent in patients with moderate-to-severe baseline pain, while differences were negligible in milder disease or symptoms. Therefore, providers should carefully consider the medical history of patients being considered for such therapy, and providers should avoid offering this treatment to patients with comorbidities that increase their risk for adverse events (e.g. CKD [chronic kidney disease], especially severe CKD, at risk for or known CVD, at risk for NSAID-related upper GI events). Adverse events associated with the use of acetaminophen appear to be dose-related, the Work Group's confidence in the quality of evidence was low, and avoidance of NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors is suggested in patients with certain comorbidities, leading to a "Weak for" recommendation.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^431dbd49]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

NSAID-induced kidney injury risk in CKD and general populations — observational and meta-analytic data: Observational studies demonstrate that nephrotoxic risks of NSAIDs are modest, somewhat predictable, and may be less than risks associated with alternative medications. Patients at higher risk for acute kidney injury (AKI) include those with heart failure, cirrhosis, CKD, or dehydration, and those on RAASi, diuretics, or calcineurin inhibitors. In non-CKD populations, studies are conflicting, with some finding no association with incident CKD and others showing increased relative risk with risk generally increasing based on intensity or duration of NSAID exposure; although larger recent studies show a consistent trend toward increased incident CKD, the absolute risks are small when reported. One report demonstrated an excess of 17 CKD events per 100,000 exposed Active-Duty U.S. service members. In patients with pre-existing CKD, a meta-analysis supported increased risk of NSAID-associated AKI with HR of 1.7 and an absolute risk of 4% in NSAID exposed versus non-exposed individuals; however, individual trial estimates varied by an order of magnitude (e.g. OR: 1.05 to 5.25), so pooled averages should be interpreted with skepticism.

### Safety of celecoxib versus traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in older patients with arthritis [^788bea6a]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this study, celecoxib treatment lasting for 120 days or more was associated with a lower risk of GI bleeding than traditional NSAIDs (OR = 0.84, P = 0.03), in accordance with the potential GI advantages attributable to the specific mechanism of selective COX-2 inhibition. However, such a relationship was not observed in other strata of shorter treatment as well as when all strata were assessed collectively. The subgroup analysis, including only those patients without co-medication with PPIs or H2RAs for gastric protection, showed no evidence of improved GI consequences with celecoxib relative to traditional NSAIDs in all strata combined as well as separately in each stratum. With regards to CV and renal toxicities, a tendency toward greater risk of endpoint events was found with celecoxib vs traditional NSAIDs; OR values with statistical significance were generally higher with longer therapy, suggesting cumulative adverse effects of more prolonged exposure to celecoxib.

Celecoxib was one of the most frequently prescribed COX inhibitors, despite lingering safety concerns about a possible class effect similar to those with other COX-2 specific inhibitors; previous coxibs had been withdrawn from the market due to CV risks. Several studies have been conducted to evaluate differential risks associated with celecoxib vs traditional NSAIDs: some to clinically confirm the theoretical GI benefits of the selective inhibition of COX-2,–and others to verify the controversial CV safety of the sole remaining coxib agent.–Evidence is accumulating that celecoxib may be a better alternative to traditional NSAIDs in patients at risk of GI bleeding in that it theoretically retains equivalent analgesic and anti-inflammatory efficacy, but with improved GI tolerability relative to traditional NSAIDs. However, in many studies, the co-prescribing of gastroprotective PPIs or H2RAs were permitted in both treatment arms, potentially functioning as a confounder affecting the GI bleeding rates.

There is little evidence about the risk of AKI associated with NSAID use in people with CKD available from randomised trials of NSAIDs because such trials routinely exclude people with CKD and rarely report renal outcomes. Under these circumstances, observational evidence provides the best guide to practice that exists. The aim of this study is to systematically review published high-quality population-based observational studies to quantify the risk of AKI due to NSAIDs in the general population and in people with pre-existing CKD.

### Practice advisory on the appropriate use of NSAIDs in primary care [^ed2f872e]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 selective and nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are important in managing acute and chronic pain secondary to inflammation. As a greater understanding of the risks of gastrointestinal (GI), cardiovascular (CV) and renal events with NSAIDs use has emerged, guidelines have evolved to reflect differences in risks among NSAIDs. Updated guidelines have yet to reflect new evidence from recent trials which showed similar CV event rates with celecoxib compared to naproxen and ibuprofen, and significantly better GI tolerability for celecoxib. This practice advisory paper aims to present consensus statements and associated guidance regarding appropriate NSAID use based on a review of current evidence by a multidisciplinary group of expert clinicians. This paper is especially intended to guide primary care practitioners within Asia in the appropriate use of NSAIDs in primary care. Following a literature review, group members used a modified Delphi consensus process to determine agreement with selected recommendations. Agreement with a statement by 75% of total voting members was defined a priori as consensus. For low GI risk patients, any nonselective NSAID plus proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or celecoxib alone is acceptable treatment when CV risk is low; for high CV risk patients, low-dose celecoxib or naproxen plus PPI is appropriate. For high GI risk patients, celecoxib plus PPI is acceptable for low CV risk patients; low-dose celecoxib plus PPI is appropriate for high CV risk patients, with the alternative to avoid NSAIDs and consider opioids instead. Appropriate NSAID prescription assumes that the patient has normal renal function at commencement, with ongoing monitoring recommended. In conclusion, appropriate NSAID use requires consideration of all risks.

### Renal effects of etoricoxib and comparator nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in controlled clinical trials [^a559580d]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Based on the experience with selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors, including rofecoxib, valdecoxib, and celecoxib, it was anticipated that etoricoxib, a new selective COX-2 inhibitor, would display mechanism-based, dose-dependent renal adverse effects (AEs) similar to those observed with nonselective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in long-term treatment.

Objective

The present analysis examined pooled safety data from the etoricoxib clinical development program with the aim of comparing the renal AE profiles of etoricoxib 60, 90, and 120 mg/d with those of approved therapeutic dosages of the comparator nonselective NSAIDs, naproxen 1000 mg/d and ibuprofen 2400 mg/d, and with that of placebo.

Methods

The etoricoxib program database included data from 8 placebo-controlled Phase III studies of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic low back pain. As part of the program-wide assessment of etoricoxib, the investigator-reported incidence of and discontinuations due to renal AEs, including hypertension, lower-extremity edema (LEE), elevated serum creatinine concentration (SCC), and congestive heart failure (CHF) were examined.

Results

Data from 4770 patients were included in the analysis. Most patients were women (69.0%-80.3%), and most were white (68.0%-83.3%). The mean (SD) age at baseline ranged from 53.6 (12.1) to 62.2 (8.4) years. Overall, the incidence of renal AEs was low and generally similar between the active-treatment groups. In the placebo; etoricoxib 60-, 90-, and 120-mg; naproxen, and ibuprofen groups, the incidences of hypertension were 2.0%, 4.0%, 3.4%, 4.7%, 2.9%, and 6.6%, respectively, and the incidences of LEE were 1.9%, 3.2%, 1.5%, 1.3%, 2.3%, and 1.8%, respectively. The only significant difference found was the incidence of hypertension with etoricoxib 90 mg/d versus that with placebo (P = 0.001); however, the rates of hypertension observed with etoricoxib at any dosage were not clinically meaningfully different versus comparator NSAIDs. Also, LEE was rarely of clinical significance with etoricoxib or comparator NSAIDs; related discontinuations were infrequent in all treatment groups. In addition, the incidences of elevated SCC and CHF were low among active-treatment groups (0.0% to 0.8% and 0.0% to 0.2%, respectively).

Conclusions

Based on this combined data review, the risks for renal AEs (i.e., hypertension, LEE, elevated SCC changes, and CHF) with etoricoxib 60, 90, and 120 mg/d were low, with a shallow dose response, and were generally similar to those found with the comparator NSAIDs naproxen 1000 mg/d and ibuprofen 2400 mg/d.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug induced acute kidney injury in the community dwelling general population and people with chronic kidney disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^348faa66]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

AKI is an increasingly common global problem causing significant morbidity and mortality and with large resource implications. Exposure to NSAIDS and other nephrotoxic drugs is an important cause of AKI, but the risk of these exposures is modified by susceptibilities such as increasing age and the presence of CKD. This study found that the odds of developing AKI increased by over 50% in people who were exposed to NSAIDs in the general population and in people with CKD, and in older people the odds of developing AKI doubled. However, the absolute risk of developing AKI also depends on the baseline risk of AKI in the population exposed, which none of the included studies reported. Future studies should use internationally agreed definitions of AKI and estimate the absolute risk of AKI in different populations including older people and people with CKD to better inform clinical decision making. There is evidence that feedback and more complex interventions to reduce NSAID prescribing in people at high risk of renal adverse effects are effective, and clinicians should seek to minimise NSAID exposure in people particularly susceptible to AKI due to age, CKD or because of the co-prescription of other nephrotoxic drugs.

### Cardiorenal effects of celecoxib as compared with the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs diclofenac and ibuprofen [^a2cef687]. Kidney International (2006). Low credibility.

The cardiorenal safety database from the Celecoxib Long-term Arthritis Safety Study (CLASS) was analyzed to examine whether supratherapeutic doses of celecoxib are associated with decreased renal function and blood pressure (BP) effects compared with standard doses of diclofenac and ibuprofen in osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. In total, 8059 patients were enrolled; 7968 received at least one dose of study drug (RA: N = 2183; OA: N = 5785). Patients received celecoxib, 400 mg twice a day (b.i.d.). (N = 3987); ibuprofen, 800 mg three times a day. (N = 1985); or diclofenac, 75 mg b.i.d. (N = 1996). Effects measured included: investigator-reported hypertension, edema or congestive heart failure, clinically important BP elevations, incidence of patients starting new antihypertensive medication, and increases in serum creatinine or reductions in creatinine clearance. Celecoxib was associated with a similar incidence of hypertension or edema to diclofenac but significantly lower than ibuprofen. The celecoxib group had significantly fewer initiations of antihypertensives versus ibuprofen. Systolic BP increases of > 20 mmHg and above 140 mmHg occurred significantly less often with celecoxib compared with ibuprofen or diclofenac. Changes in serum creatinine or estimated creatinine clearance occurred in a similar percentage of patients taking celecoxib or ibuprofen; modest differences were evident against diclofenac. In patients with mild prerenal azotemia, significantly fewer patients taking celecoxib exhibited clinically important reductions in renal function (3.7%), compared with diclofenac (7.3%; P < 0.05) and ibuprofen (7.3%; P < 0.05). A supratherapeutic dose of celecoxib was associated with an improved cardiorenal safety profile compared with standard doses of either ibuprofen or diclofenac.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Elderly patients, compared to younger patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions. If the anticipated benefit for the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks, treat for the fewest number of days per month, as needed, and monitor patients for adverse effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.6, 5.15)].

In the controlled clinical trials for migraine, approximately 70 patients were ≥ 65 years of age. Of the total number of patients who received celecoxib (for indications other than migraine) in pre-approval clinical trials, more than 3,300 were 65–74 years of age, while approximately 1,300 additional patients were 75 years and over. No substantial differences in effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. In clinical studies comparing renal function as measured by the GFR, BUN and creatinine, and platelet function as measured by bleeding time and platelet aggregation, the results were not different between elderly and young volunteers.

However, as with other NSAIDs, including those that selectively inhibit COX-2, there have been more spontaneous postmarketing reports of fatal GI events and acute renal failure in the elderly than in younger patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.6)].

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

No dosage adjustment is needed for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A). Reduce the dose of ELYXYB in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The use of ELYXYB in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) is not recommended.

### Nephrotoxic potential of selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors [^57e68194]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the relative nephrotoxic potential of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1996-February 2004) identified clinical trials evaluating the nephrotoxicity of COX-2 inhibitors versus traditional nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Key search terms included cyclooxygenase inhibitors, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, nephrotoxicity, and chemically induced.

Data Synthesis

Three clinical trials determined that COX-2 inhibitors have similar adverse effects on the kidney when compared with nonselective NSAIDs, while 2 studies concluded that COX-2 inhibitors are less nephrotoxic than nonselective NSAIDs. All 5 trials utilized low numbers of subjects, short-term therapy, and surrogate markers of kidney damage.

Conclusions

COX-2 inhibitors may not offer distinct advantages over nonselective NSAIDs with respect to kidney function. Longer trials in patients with comorbidities are warranted. These agents should be used cautiously or not at all in patients with predisposing conditions.

Methods

Data sources and search strategy

MEDLINE and EMBASE were systematically searched from inception to June 21th 2016 using OVID from the Knowledge Network using a predetermined list of keywords including NSAIDs, renal diseases and renal function measurements modified from the search strategies used by two related Cochrane reviews (see Additional file 1 for search strategy). Search results were restricted to cross-sectional, cohort and case-control studies in the English language. The reference lists from all identified primary studies, review articles, Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines for CKD and AKI and OpenSIGLE (unpublished literature database) were manually checked to screen for additional relevant papers.

Citations were independently screened for eligibility by two reviewers based on title and abstract (XZ and SB or XZ and BG). If one or more authors deemed the study potentially relevant, or if there was any uncertainty about eligibility based on title and abstract alone, then the full text paper was retrieved for review. Authors of original studies were not contacted. Study selection and quality assessment from full-text papers retrieved were performed independently by two reviewers (XZ and BG).

Opioids versus NSAIDs in chronic kidney disease (CKD) not requiring dialysis — associations with outcomes and utilization: In a prospective cohort followed for a median of 6.8 years, baseline full-agonist opioid and NSAID use were 9.9% and 15.5% respectively; baseline opioid use was associated with increased risk for a kidney disease composite outcome, kidney failure requiring KRT, hospitalization, and death, whereas baseline NSAID use was associated with increased risk for the kidney disease composite outcome and hospitalization, with outcomes not consistent among subgroups, and overall opioid use had a stronger association with adverse effects than NSAIDs. Given benefits and risks, some reviews now recommend considering cautious time-limited use of NSAIDs with consideration of individual risk factors, SDM, and careful monitoring.

### Literature review: are NSAIDs harmful and is acetaminophen well tolerated? [^e18df646]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

On the basis of previous literature, NSAID use is typically avoided in patients at risk for kidney disease, while acetaminophen has generally been considered well tolerated. However, the extent of NSAID effect on the kidneys is not clear, especially in chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the concerns about the safety of acetaminophen have been rising. In this review, we will discuss the latest evidence of the effects of NSAIDs and acetaminophen in the context of nephrology and hypertension.

Recent Findings

The risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) by NSAIDs is higher with longer courses and in the presence of several factors such as older age, diabetes mellitus, lower eGFR, diuretic use and cardiovascular disease. The timing of NSAID use in relation to the onset of AKI may affect its progression. Regular NSAID use could be associated with an increased incidence of CKD, but the relation between NSAID use and CKD progression is less clear. Regular acetaminophen use was associated with increased SBP, while its use could have a renoprotective effect in certain situations.

Summary

In patients at risk of kidney disease, NSAIDs may be used cautiously after discussing possible adverse effects. Regular acetaminophen use should be reassessed in patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

### Cyclooxygenase-2 selectively controls renal blood flow through a novel PPAR β / δ-dependent vasodilator pathway [^4997eaba]. Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is an inducible enzyme expressed at sites of inflammation and in cancer. As such, COX-2 is the therapeutic target for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) that include ibuprofen, diclofenac, and celecoxib. NSAIDs are among the world's most consumed medications to treat pain and inflammation, with an estimated 30 billion doses consumed annually in the United States.NSAIDs can also prevent cancer with prospective clinical trials reporting that celecoxib prevents ≈50% of colon cancers in susceptible individuals. The greatest limitation in the therapeutic use of NSAIDs is their cardiovascular and renal safety profile. Indeed, NSAIDs are an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events, and concern surrounding their cardiovascular side effects has virtually arrested new drug development and led to a failure to realize the full potential of blocking COX-2 for cancer prevention. Thus, there is an urgent need to understand how COX-2 protects the cardiovascular system. It was initially thought that cardiovascular side effects were limited to drugs that selectively target COX-2, such as Vioxx (rofecoxib) and Celebrex (celecoxib), which were introduced in the early 2000s. However, as a result of subsequent epidemiology analysesand 2 large recent clinical cardiovascular outcome studies, SCOT (Standard Care Versus Celecoxib Outcome Trial)and PRECISION (Prospective Randomized Evaluation of Celecoxib Integrated Safety vs Ibuprofen or Naproxen), it is clear that traditional NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, carry at least as great a cardiovascular and renal risk as the COX-2 selective drug celecoxib.

### Safety of celecoxib versus traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in older patients with arthritis [^a5d34798]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Older patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis often require long-term treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the relief of chronic pain and inflammation. With their decreased renal function and gastrointestinal (GI) physiological changes progressing with aging, those patients are more predisposed to adverse effects of prolonged exposure to the ulcerogenic analgesics. It is well documented that the GI toxicity of NSAIDs is associated with the nonselective inhibition of the two cyclooxygenase (COX) isoforms, where COX-1 inhibition prevents the production of GI protective prostaglandins resulting in higher risk of ulcerogenic adverse events, while COX-2 inhibition exerts anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. Traditional NSAIDs are mostly a dual inhibitor of both COX isoforms, and hence can cause GI toxicities. Celecoxib, however, by selectively inhibiting COX-2, has the potential to reduce GI adverse effects, but previous studies suggested that the unbalanced inhibition of COX or prostaglandin synthesis may pose a greater risk of cardiovascular (CV) adverse outcomes.

Due to the controversies over CV safety of COX-2 specific inhibitors, rofecoxib and valdecoxib were withdrawn from the market in 2004 and 2005, respectively. The only remaining coxib agent, celecoxib, has been made continuously available for clinical use, despite the 2005 clinical trial results that suggested increased CV risks with its use. Such a relationship was deemed inconclusive in light of a low incidence of CV events and higher-than-normal doses used for celecoxib in the trial. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), however, required an additional clinical investigation of reassurance regarding celecoxib's CV safety; the 2016 study showed that celecoxib was not inferior to ibuprofen nor to naproxen in terms of CV safety outcomes. However, although the safety of moderate doses of celecoxib (200–400 mg daily) has been supported by the postmarketing trial findings, whether higher doses, often encountered in real-world clinical practice where regulatory restrictions on its doses are not put in place, would also be safe remains uncertain.

The aim of this study was to evaluate adverse drug events with celecoxib as compared to traditional NSAIDs, focusing on GI, CV, and renal toxicity, in older patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, using National Health Insurance (NHI) data in Korea.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) route and duration — risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) and hyperkalemia in older adults and patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD): Observational analyses examining the first 30 days after a newly prescribed topical, short course (< 14 days), or longer course NSAID found in older adults that both topical (OR: 1.48) and short-course oral NSAIDs (OR: 1.59) were associated with increased risk at 30 days; a similar analysis reported adjusted odds for AKI or hyperkalemia at 30 days of 1.29 for topical NSAIDs, 1.43 for systemic NSAIDs of < 15 days, and 1.84 for systemic NSAIDs of ≥ 15 days, with incrementally higher odds with oral and prolonged administration. Among patients with CKD, topical and oral NSAIDs (compared with no NSAID prescription) were associated with AKI (OR: 1.38 and 1.77 respectively), and moderate and severe AKI were increased with oral NSAIDs but not topical NSAIDs. While each analysis attempted to control for confounders, it is unclear how much residual confounding by indication remains, and the literature suggests that the risk of adverse kidney outcomes is decreased (but likely not eliminated) by use of topical rather than oral NSAIDs.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in chronic pain: implications of new data for clinical practice [^4ade189d]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Latest clinical trial data

Relevant studies that have been published since the last consensus document in this field are the PRECISIONand CONCERNclinical trials and a meta-analysis of individual patient data authored by Bally et al. The PRECISION trial was the first study of NSAIDs in high-CV-risk patients and the first to compare a c2s agent with naproxen and ibuprofen. All three NSAIDs provided effective pain relief in patients with OA or RA (with no clinically significant differences between groups). Celecoxib was noninferior to naproxen and ibuprofen for the primary CV-event end point and was associated with significantly fewer GI and serious renal events compared with the ns-NSAIDs.

The focus of the CONCERN study was adverse GI events. The trial included patients with arthritis who also had cardiothrombotic diseases requiring low-dose aspirin and a history of upper-GI-tract bleeding. Subjects were randomized to celecoxib 100 mg twice daily or naproxen 500 mg twice daily, both in combination with a prophylactic proton-pump inhibitor (PPI). The primary end point was recurrent upper-GI-tract bleeding within 18 months. The cumulative incidence of primary end-point events with celecoxib was less than half that with naproxen. The rate of serious CV events (a secondary end point of the trial) did not differ significantly between the two treatment groups. The key features and results of the PRECISION and CONCERN studies, along with the earlier MEDAL program that looked at long-term use of etoricoxib, are summarized in Table 1.

### Meta-analysis comparing celecoxib with diclofenac sodium in patients with knee osteoarthritis [^a0c3b9d0]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The safety of drugs is an important problem in clinical applications. KOA is prone to occurring in middle-aged and elderly people. Most NSAIDs can stimulate the gastrointestinal tract, induce ulcers, and affect renal function and platelets. Because selective COX-2 inhibitors do not affect the activity of COX-1, they can reduce the gastrointestinal events caused by the inhibition of COX-1. One of the concerns about COX-2 selective inhibitors is that they increase cardiovascular risk. Traditional NSAIDs (such as aspirin) have a certain protective effect on the cardiovascular system. They selectively inhibit platelet COX-1 and, thus, reduce TXA synthesis, but they do not affect the production of anti-aggregation PG and prostacyclin (COX-2-mediated) by endothelial cells. COX-2 selective inhibitors reduce the synthesis of prostacyclin in endothelial cells, thus increasing the rate of thrombosis, which leads to cardiovascular events. There are four types of renal damage caused by NSAIDs: acute renal insufficiency, acute interstitial nephritis, chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal papillary necrosis. Currently, the mechanism of renal damage from NSAIDs has not been fully elucidated but may be related to the following factors: 1) inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis and reduction of local vasodilator factors in the kidney, which may lead to renal vasoconstriction and decrease in renal blood flow; 2) inhibition of renal tubular cell enzyme activity due to direct tubular toxicity; 3) medullary arteriosclerosis, leading to renal papillary necrosis; and 4) drug-induced allergic reactions.

### Practice advisory on the appropriate use of NSAIDs in primary care [^7d5a760e]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Inflammation is common in many chronic pain conditions where the burden of disease is high. NSAIDs are an effective therapy for such conditions, but appropriate risk evaluation is important when selecting an NSAID in order to balance efficacy and risk. This practice advisory serves to update previously published guidelines, and in particular offers PCPs a simplified approach to choosing an appropriate NSAID for pain management based on recent evidence and according to the risk profile of individual patients. In this regard, all NSAIDs have a safety profile that requires consideration of GI, CV and renal risk. Whereas GI and CV risk were previously acknowledged according to COX-1 and COX-2 selectivity, respectively, it is apparent that this is too simplistic and appropriate risk management requires consideration of the individual (ie, non-class) effects of each NSAID. Having chosen an appropriate NSAID, there is an ongoing need for patient monitoring and risk assessment.

### Effect of aspirin coadministration on the safety of celecoxib, naproxen, or Ibuprofen [^23ecd5db]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The safety of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and aspirin coadministration is uncertain.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to compare the safety of combining NSAIDs with low-dose aspirin.

Methods

This analysis of the PRECISION (Prospective Randomized Evaluation of Celecoxib Integrated Safety Versus Ibuprofen or Naproxen) trial included 23,953 patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis at increased cardiovascular risk randomized to celecoxib, ibuprofen, or naproxen. The on-treatment population was used for this study. Outcomes included composite major adverse cardiovascular events, noncardiovascular death, gastrointestinal or renal events, and components of the composite. Cox proportional hazards models compared outcomes among NSAIDs stratified by aspirin use following propensity score adjustment. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare the cumulative probability of events.

Results

When taken without aspirin, naproxen or ibuprofen had greater risk for the primary composite endpoint compared with celecoxib (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.52; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.22 to 1.90, p < 0.001; and HR: 1.81; 95% CI: 1.46 to 2.26; p < 0.001, respectively). Compared with celecoxib, ibuprofen had more major adverse cardiovascular events (p < 0.05), and both ibuprofen and naproxen had more gastrointestinal (p < 0.001) and renal (p < 0.05) events. Taken with aspirin, ibuprofen had greater risk for the primary composite endpoint compared with celecoxib (HR: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.06 to 1.51; p < 0.01); this was not significantly higher with naproxen (HR: 1.18; 95% CI: 0.98 to 1.41; p = 0.08). Among patients on aspirin, major adverse cardiovascular events were similar among NSAIDs, and compared with celecoxib, ibuprofen had more gastrointestinal and renal events (p < 0.05), while naproxen had more gastrointestinal events (p < 0.05), without a difference in renal events. Similar results were seen on adjusted Kaplan-Meier analysis.

Conclusions

Celecoxib has a more favorable overall safety profile than naproxen or ibuprofen when taken without aspirin. Adding aspirin attenuates the safety advantage of celecoxib, although celecoxib is still associated with fewer gastrointestinal events than ibuprofen or naproxen and fewer renal events than ibuprofen.

### Effects of celecoxib and naproxen on renal function in the elderly… [^1f8c6cb8]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

The results indicate that cyclooxygenase 2–specific inhibition in healthy elderly subjects may spare renal hemodynamic function, although the effects on sodium excretion, as well as urinary prostaglandin E2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1α excretion, appear to be similar to those of nonspecific cyclooxygenase inhibitors such as naproxen. In the kidney, the relative physiological roles of the two COX isozymes remain unidentified. Although it is now apparent that COX-2 is constitutively expressed in the kidney, 14, 20–23 the differential expression and localization of COX-1 and COX-2 suggests that the two isozymes may have different physiological functions and also species-related differences in their functions. Therefore, some or perhaps all of the undesirable NSAID effects could be eliminated or significantly reduced by inhibiting only COX-2 while leaving COX-1–mediated renal prostaglandin production intact.

The possibility that the reductions in urinary PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1α excretion with celecoxib are the result of renal COX-1 inhibition is not supported by evidence gathered to date. Other studies have shown that celecoxib administration at single doses up to 800 mg and multiple doses of 600 mg BID do not inhibit platelet COX-1 activity. 24, 34 Additionally, tissue distribution studies indicate that plasma concentrations generally reflect tissue concentrations of celecoxib within the kidney in animal models.
35. Mean urinary sodium levels fell significantly on the first 1 to 2 days of dosing with both celecoxib and naproxen. Thereafter, urinary sodium excretion returned to baseline and remained within the normal range for the duration of the study.

Celecoxib was not associated with large or persistent reductions in sodium excretion, and it remains to be established whether celecoxib is associated with a degree of sodium retention comparable with that of other COX-2–specific inhibitors or conventional, ie, nonspecific, NSAIDs. In conclusion, it is evident from our study that celecoxib is not associated with detrimental changes of GFR in healthy elderly subjects, unlike the effects observed with naproxen. These observations suggest that celecoxib may afford benefits to those, such as the elderly, who are susceptible to the acute renal hemodynamic changes that may occur when both of the COX isozymes are inhibited.

### Safety of celecoxib versus traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in older patients with arthritis [^d6da183c]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

In accordance with the FDA's mandate for reassurance on long-term CV safety of celecoxib, a postmarketing clinical trial titled the Prospective Randomized Evaluation of Celecoxib Integrated Safety vs Ibuprofen or Naproxen (PRECISION) was conducted. The trial findings revealed that celecoxib at moderate doses (up to 400 mg/day) was noninferior to ibuprofen or to naproxen in terms of CV adverse outcomes. However, the PRECISION trial had a major flaw in its design: due to regulatory restrictions, celecoxib up-titration was not permitted particularly in 89.9% of study patients with osteoarthritis, while the doses of the comparator NSAIDs could have been escalated as needed for symptom management. Hence, the dose of celecoxib may not have been equipotent to that of comparator drugs, potentially confounding the results: administering a higher dose of the comparator NSAIDs was more effective in reducing pain, but perhaps put patients at an increased risk of developing adverse GI, CV, and renal events as compared to celecoxib use with dose capping. Interestingly, the findings in the current study in general indicated an increased risk of CV consequences with celecoxib relative to traditional NSAIDs, which might have been influenced by higher-than-approved doses of celecoxib used in a considerable proportion of patients included herein. Despite the dosing guidelines recommendations with regard to dose escalation up to 200 mg/day for osteoarthritis patients and up to 400 mg/day for rheumatoid arthritis patients, it was noted that 24.3% of osteoarthritis-only patients on celecoxib received more than 200 mg/day, and, more importantly, 4.7% of celecoxib-treated patients received more than 400 mg/day in the current study.

### The prevalence of cardiorenal risk factors in patients prescribed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: data from managed care [^f5c05b48]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown to cause abnormalities in renal function. This is an important concern in patients with cardiorenal risk factors, including hypertension, congestive heart failure, edema, renal impairment, and advanced age.

Objectives

The goals of this study were to determine the prevalence of cardiorenal risk factors in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or osteoarthritis and ascertain whether these risk factors are associated with prescribing patterns of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-selective inhibitors and other NSAIDs.

Methods

This was a retrospective, longitudinal claims analysis using data from 19 large independent-practice-model managed care health plans in the United Stated. Three cohorts were identified based on claims for celecoxib, rofecoxib, or other NSAIDs from October 1, 1999, through September 30, 2000. Logistic regression models were used to explore whether baseline cardiorenal risk factors were related to choice of therapy.

Results

A total of 77,552 patients received celecoxib (n = 6779 [8.74%]), rofecoxib (n = 7189 [9.27%]), or other NSAIDs (n = 63,584 [81.99%]). Patients prescribed COX-2-selective inhibitors were older than those receiving other NSAIDs and had a diagnosis of RA more often. Overall, 42% of patients had ≥ 1 cardiorenal risk factor, and approximately one third had hypertension. Cardiorenal risk factors were not related to physicians' prescribing of celecoxib or rofecoxib, but the presence of any cardiorenal risk factor was associated with an increase in the use of COX-2-selective inhibitors compared with other NSAIDs, from 12% for cerebrovascular disease (point estimate, 1.124; P < 0.001) to 74% for chronic renal failure/nephritis (point estimate, 1.738; P = 0.025). RA and advanced age were associated with the use of celecoxib rather than rofecoxib.

Conclusions

The prevalence of cardiorenal risk factors was found to be similar in patients prescribed celecoxib or rofecoxib for arthritis. Patients with these risk factors were more likely to receive a COX-2-selective inhibitor than other NSAIDs.

### Celecoxib-induced acute interstitial nephritis [^37c9c55f]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Data about the nephrotoxicity of selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors are still evolving. Acute interstitial nephritis is a well-described complication of therapy with nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. We report a case of biopsy-proven acute interstitial nephritis in a 73-year-old diabetic woman, who had taken celecoxib for more than 1 year before presentation. She presented with clinical findings of subnephrotic proteinuria and acute renal failure that required dialysis. She recovered renal function with cessation of celecoxib therapy after 2 weeks. Other medications were reintroduced safely, without recurrence of renal failure. A kidney biopsy specimen showed acute interstitial nephritis with a prominent eosinophilic infiltrate in the interstitium. This case documents the occurrence of acute interstitial nephritis with celecoxib and emphasizes the need for continued vigilance and care in use of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors in high-risk patients.

### Safety of celecoxib versus traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in older patients with arthritis [^a7fda60c]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

A 2011 systematic review found an increased cardiovascular (CV) risk at both ≤ 200 mg/day and > 200 mg/day doses of celecoxib. This study aimed to evaluate adverse drug events with celecoxib relative to traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in real-world practice settings, focusing on gastrointestinal (GI), CV, and renal toxicity, in older patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis.

Methods

In this population-based retrospective cohort study using national health insurance claims data in Korea, patients aged 65 years and older with arthritis who were treated with celecoxib or traditional NSAIDs for ≥ 30 days in 2016, were included for study analyses. The primary outcome was hospital encounter for GI bleeding associated with celecoxib vs traditional NSAIDs use. The secondary outcomes included a composite of CV diseases, coronary revascularization, and incident renal events.

Results

After 1:1 propensity score matching, 73,748 patients in each cohort were identified for study entry. Celecoxib treatment which lasted for ≥ 120 days was associated with a lower risk of GI bleeding than traditional NSAIDs (OR = 0.84, P = 0.03). Such a relationship was not observed in shorter treatment strata and overall in all strata combined. When patients with gastroprotective prophylaxis were excluded from subgroup analysis, no evidence of improved GI tolerability was observed with celecoxib. CV and renal risks appeared higher with celecoxib than with traditional NSAIDs (OR = 1.08, P < 0.001 and OR = 1.22, P < 0.001, respectively). About 4.7% of celecoxib users received a higher than maximum dose (400 mg/day); a dose-dependent increase in CV and renal risks was assessed with celecoxib.

Conclusion

Celecoxib was associated with decreased risk of GI bleeding compared with traditional NSAIDs when treatment lasted for ≥ 120 days, but such a relationship was not found among subgroup patients with no concomitant use of gastroprotective prophylaxis. Celecoxib users were more likely to experience CV and renal events than traditional NSAIDs users, and a dose-dependent risk relationship was observed with celecoxib.

### NSAID use and progression of chronic kidney disease [^69ac608b]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

The effects of nonselective and selective cyclooxygenase-2 specific (COX-2) nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use on the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is uncertain. Due to the high prevalence of both CKD and NSAID use in older adults, we sought to determine the association between NSAID use and the progression of CKD in an elderly community-based cohort.

Methods

All subjects ≥ 66 years of age who had at least one serum creatinine measurement in 2 time periods (July-December, 2001 and July-December, 2003) were included. Multiple logistic regression analyses, including covariates for age, sex, baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), diabetes, and comorbidity were used to explore the associations of NSAID use on the primary (decrease in eGFR of ≥ 15 mL/min/1.73) and secondary (mean change in eGFR) outcomes.

Results

A total of 10,184 subjects (mean age 76 years; 57% female) were followed for a median of 2.75 years. High-dose NSAID users (upper decile of cumulative NSAID exposure) experienced a 26% increased risk for the primary outcome (odds ratio [OR] 1.26, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04–1.53). A linear association between cumulative NSAID dose and change in mean GFR also was seen. No risk differential was identified between selective and nonselective NSAID users.

Conclusions

High cumulative NSAID exposure is associated with an increased risk for rapid CKD progression in the setting of a community-based elderly population. For older adult patients with CKD, these results suggest that nonselective NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors should be used cautiously and chronic exposure to any NSAID should be avoided.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug induced acute kidney injury in the community dwelling general population and people with chronic kidney disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1f1695f3]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

The study strengths include careful study selection and the use of a structured quality assessment tool to ensure that only high quality studies were included. The observed associations were consistent across subgroups, but the study has several limitations. As with all systematic reviews, the findings depend on the quality of the included studies. We chose to review and meta-analyse observational studies because an initial literature search identified that trials of NSAIDs rarely report renal outcomes (the focus of this study) and exclude people with CKD (a key topic of interest) and other comorbidities as well as older people and minority groups. However, observational studies are vulnerable to residual confounding by measured and unmeasured variables. An example is confounding by indication, which in this context is likely to occur if prescribers avoid NSAIDs in people they perceive to be at higher risk of NSAID toxicity including AKI, which would lead to an underestimation of AKI risk if present. There were also large differences between studies in the population examined and the way in which AKI was measured, both of which likely contributed to the observed moderate to large heterogeneity between studies. It is also important to recognise that the estimate of the risk of NSAIDs in the general population is adjusted for potential confounders, but the estimate in people with CKD is not because only one study reported an adjusted estimate. Other limitations include that we only included studies published in English, that there were a relatively small number of studies suitable for inclusion which made meta-regression to explore heterogeneity unfeasible, and that the rate of concomitant use of OTC NSAID use could not be assessed in the populations studied. Seven of the included studies addressed that OCT NSAID use may have caused exposure misclassification. But all of the studies believed that due to reasons such as financial incentives, the proportion of OCT NSAID users is expected to be small and nondifferential with respect to the NSAID categories the populations studied. Consequently, it would bias the results toward the null. As most of the studies confirmed eligible cases then selected controls according to a certain proportion, non-response rate was not given in the majority of the included studies. Since cases and controls of these studies were derived from the same databases, were examined for the same exposure and followed up in the same way, then non-response rate is not considered to be a problem and therefore it is unlikely there would be missing data bias. We were unable to access publication bias because of the extensive statistical heterogeneity. For many of the methodological qualities assessed there was an unclear risk of bias as studies did not provide explicit detail to make an informed judgement.

### Pharmacology of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition in the kidney [^847d0f89]. Kidney International (2002). Low credibility.

Cyclooxygenase (COX) exists as two unique isoforms (that is, COX-1 and COX-2) which are poorly understood with regard to their roles in renal function. The renal effects of conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are believed to result from the inhibition of one or both isoforms. Drugs that selectively inhibit COX-2 provide useful pharmacological tools for discerning the effects associated with the inhibition of the individual isoforms, and may help clarify the renal roles of COX-1 and COX-2. This review summarizes the current data on the renal expression of COX isoforms and their potential roles in renal function, and reviews the studies that have attempted to correlate renal functional changes with selective isoform inhibition. Since there are significant differences in the expression of COX isoforms in the kidneys of laboratory animals and humans, this review also examines the correlation of the results of COX inhibition in experimental studies in laboratory animals with clinical data. Because of potential interspecies differences in the roles of COX isoforms in renal function, animal models may have limited predictive value for patients, particularly those with renal risk factors. Accordingly, any uncertainty concerning the safety or therapeutic benefit of COX-2-specific drugs in these patient populations will need to be resolved with clinical investigations.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug induced acute kidney injury in the community dwelling general population and people with chronic kidney disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^731cba9f]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, this study is the first meta-analysis to examine associations between NSAID exposure and AKI in the general community-dwelling population and people with CKD. A previous systematic review which was conducted in 2014 included five observational studies and reported risk of AKI by individual NSAID exposure, finding a statistically significant elevated AKI risk among most of the traditional NSAIDs but did not achieve a statistical significance for COX-2 inhibitors or traditional NSAIDs with higher COX-2 selectivity (meloxicam and diclofenac). Our study used a more comprehensive search and included additional studies, and found a similar estimate of pooled risk but statistically significantly increased risk irrespective of COX-2 selectivity. Another systematic review specifically focused on myocardial, vascular and renal risks of COX-2-selective meloxicam allowed a broad definition of renal outcomes and it did not find a significantly increased renal risk. A third systematic review examined the risk of CKD progression associated with NSAID use, finding that high (but not standard) dose NSAID use was associated with an increased risk of CKD progression.

### Update on cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors [^723d82a7]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs represent the most commonly used medications for the treatment of pain and inflammation, but numerous well-described side effects can limit their use. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors were initially touted as a therapeutic strategy to avoid not only the gastrointestinal but also the renal and cardiovascular side effects of nonspecific nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. However, in the kidney, COX-2 is constitutively expressed and is highly regulated in response to alterations in intravascular volume. COX-2 metabolites have been implicated in mediation of renin release, regulation of sodium excretion, and maintenance of renal blood flow. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge about both renal and cardiovascular side effects that are attributed to COX-2 selective inhibitors.

### Celecoxib-induced nonoliguric acute renal failure [^574bac6d]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of nonoliguric acute renal failure secondary to use of celecoxib in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis.

Case Summary

A 43-year-old Hispanic woman started receiving celecoxib 200 mg/d for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Fourteen days after initiating therapy, she developed nonoliguric acute renal failure. Celecoxib was discontinued. Renal function improved, but had not returned to normal 30 days after presentation.

Discussion

Only 2 cases of reversible oliguric acute renal failure and volume overload have been reported 13 and 14 days after initiating therapy with celecoxib. Renal function in the 2 patients returned to baseline after treatment with diuretics. To our knowledge, the development of nonoliguric acute renal failure secondary to treatment with celecoxib has not previously been reported.

Conclusions

Celecoxib can probably result in reversible, or nonoliguric, acute renal failure. Although renal function improves after discontinuation of celecoxib, it may not return to baseline. Celecoxib should be used cautiously in individuals at risk of developing acute renal failure.

### Patterns of NSAIDs use and their association with other analgesic use in CKD [^c954e304]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Avoiding nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is important for safe CKD care. This study examined nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use patterns and their association with other analgesic use in CKD.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

The Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study is an observational cohort study that enrolled 3939 adults ages 21–74 years old with CKD between 2003 and 2008 using age-based eGFR inclusion criteria. Annual visits between June of 2003 and December of 2011 were organized into 15,917 visit-pairs (with an antecedent and subsequent visit) for 3872 participants with medication information. Demographics, kidney function, and clinical factors were ascertained along with report of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug or other analgesic use in the prior 30 days.

Results

In our study, 24% of participants reported nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use at baseline or at least one follow-up study visit. Having a 10 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 higher eGFR level at an antecedent visit was associated with higher odds of starting nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs at a subsequent visit (odds ratio, 1.44; 95% confidence interval, 1.34 to 1.56). Seeing a nephrologist at the antecedent visit was associated with lower odds of starting or staying on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs at a subsequent visit (odds ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.56 to 0.87 and odds ratio, 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.46 to 0.81, respectively). Starting and stopping nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were both associated with higher odds of increasing the number of other analgesics (odds ratio, 1.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.25 to 1.85 and odds ratio, 1.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.39 to 2.28, respectively) and higher odds of increasing the number of opioid analgesics specifically (odds ratio, 1.92; 95% confidence interval, 1.48 to 2.48 and odds ratio, 1.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.04 to 2.03, respectively).

Conclusions

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use is common among patients with CKD but less so among those with worse kidney function or those who see a nephrologist. Initiation or discontinuation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is often associated with supplementation with or replacement by, respectively, other analgesics, including opioids, which introduces possible drug-related problems when taking these alternative analgesics.

### The risk of major NSAID toxicity with celecoxib, ibuprofen, or naproxen: a secondary analysis of the PRECISION trial [^ecaa830b]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The relative safety of long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is unclear. Patients and providers are interested in an integrated view of risk. We examined the risk of major nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug toxicity in the PRECISION trial.

Methods

We conducted a post hoc analysis of a double-blind, randomized, controlled, multicenter trial enrolling 24,081 patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis at moderate or high cardiovascular risk. Patients were randomized to receive celecoxib 100 to 200 mg twice daily, ibuprofen 600 to 800 mg thrice daily, or naproxen 375 to 500 mg twice daily. All patients were provided with a proton pump inhibitor. The outcome was major nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug toxicity, including time to first occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events, important gastrointestinal events, renal events, and all-cause mortality.

Results

During follow-up, 4.1% of subjects sustained any major toxicity in the celecoxib arm, 4.8% in the naproxen arm, and 5.3% in the ibuprofen arm. Analyses adjusted for aspirin use and geographic region found that subjects in the naproxen arm had a 20% (95% CI 4–39) higher risk of major toxicity than celecoxib users and that 38% (95% CI 19–59) higher risk. These risks translate into numbers needed to harm of 135 (95% CI, 72–971) for naproxen and 82 (95% CI, 53–173) for ibuprofen, both compared with celecoxib.

Conclusions

Among patients with symptomatic arthritis who had moderate to high risk of cardiovascular events, approximately 1 in 20 experienced a major toxicity over 1 to 2 years. Patients using naproxen or ibuprofen experienced significantly higher risk of major toxicity than those using celecoxib.

### Celecoxib in the management of acute renal colic: a randomized controlled clinical trial [^42e49d8e]. Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of celecoxib as an analgesic and medical expulsive agent in acute renal colic.

Methods

A prospective randomized double-blind study was conducted on patients presenting with an obstructing ureteral calculus < 10 mm in largest diameter. Patients were randomized to 400 mg of celecoxib, followed by 200 mg every 12 hours for 10 days, or to placebo. Patients with a solitary kidney, renal insufficiency (CR > 1.8), urinary tract infection, or significant cardiovascular disease were excluded.

Results

A total of 57 patients provided consent of which 53 completed the study. Four patients were excluded from the analysis because of stone passage or withdrawal of consent before the first dose of study medication. No significant difference was noted in the spontaneous stone passage rate (celecoxib 55.2%, placebo 54.2%) and between celecoxib and placebo with regard to days to stone passage (7.0 vs 9.0, P = 0.6) or size of stone passed (3.9 vs 4.6 mm, P = 0.18). No significant difference was noted in pain analog scores (2.6 vs 3.5, P = 0.71) or narcotic doses (13.2 vs 13.6, P = 0.74). Furthermore, a 25% decrease in narcotic use (or 19 mg based on placebo mean) was outside the 80% one-sided confidence interval for the change in mean narcotic use between the 2 groups. Thus, it is unlikely (< 20%) that we missed a clinically significant beneficial effect of celecoxib on narcotic consumption because of sample size.

Conclusions

Celecoxib does not facilitate stone passage or decrease narcotic requirements in patients with acute renal colic.

### Geriatric trauma management [^38cb5897]. ACS (2023). High credibility.

Medication management — nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in older adults — NSAIDs are known to have increased side effects in the older adult; limit the length of NSAID courses and use the lowest effective dose. Avoid NSAIDs in older adults with stage 3 chronic kidney disease (creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min), GI bleeding, platelet dysfunction, reduced cardiac output, hypovolemia, hyponatremia, hepatic impairment, or anticoagulation. Traditional NSAIDs reversibly inhibit platelet function and may alter the cardioprotective effects of aspirin, and their use with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants decreases platelet function in an additive manner; an increased risk of gastropathy is present, and pharmacologic gastroprotection is indicated. COX-2 selective agents are not associated with platelet dysfunction, but the patient may need gastroprotection if on concurrent low-dose aspirin.

### Potentially inappropriately prescribed medications among Medicare medication therapy management eligible patients with chronic kidney disease: an observational analysis [^1b6b8939]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Potentially inappropriately prescribed medications (PIPMs) among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) may vary among clinical settings. Rates of PIPM are unknown among Medicare-enrolled Medication Therapy Management (MTM) eligible patients.

Objectives

Determine prevalence of PIPM among patients with CKD and evaluate characteristics of patients and providers associated with PIPM.

Design

An observational cross-sectional investigation of a Medicare insurance plan for the year 2018.

Patients

Medicare-enrolled MTM eligible patients with stage 3–5 CKD.

Main Measures

PIPM was identified utilizing a tertiary database. Logistic regression assessed relationship between patient characteristics and PIPM.

Key Results

Investigation included 3624 CKD patients: 2856 (79%), 548 (15%), and 220 (6%) patients with stage 3, 4, and 5 CKD, respectively. Among patients with stage 3, stage 4, and stage 5 CKD, 618, 430, and 151 were with at least one PIPM, respectively. Logistic regression revealed patients with stage 4 or 5 CKD had 7–14 times the odds of having a PIPM in comparison to patients with stage 3 disease (p < 0.001). Regression also found PIPM was associated with increasing number of years qualified for MTM (odds ratio (OR) 1.46–1.74, p ≤ 0.005), female gender (OR 1.25, p = 0.008), and increasing polypharmacy (OR 1.30–1.57, p ≤ 0.01). Approximately 14% of all medications (2879/21093) were considered PIPM. Majority of PIPMs (62%) were prescribed by physician primary care providers (PCPs). Medications with the greatest percentage of PIPM were spironolactone, canagliflozin, sitagliptin, levetiracetam, alendronate, pregabalin, pravastatin, fenofibrate, metformin, gabapentin, famotidine, celecoxib, naproxen, meloxicam, rosuvastatin, diclofenac, and ibuprofen.

Conclusion

Over one-third of Medicare MTM eligible patients with CKD presented with at least one PIPM. Worsening renal function, length of MTM eligibility, female gender, and polypharmacy were associated with having PIPM. Majority of PIPMs were prescribed by PCPs. Clinical decision support tools may be considered to potentially reduce PIPM among Medicare MTM-enrolled patients with CKD.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^2f811156]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 chronic kidney disease — over‑the‑counter (OTC) analgesics, herbal remedies, and dietary supplements carry specific kidney risks and handling guidance: indiscriminate chronic OTC NSAID use has been associated with a higher risk of kidney failure compared with nonuse and should be discouraged, whereas judicious NSAID use under careful supervision of a nephrologist may be preferred to opioids with stronger associations with adverse events; PPIs are also common OTC medications in some countries that have been associated with AKI and CKD due to tubulointerstitial nephritis and acute interstitial nephritis; herbal compound use is highly prevalent, often unmonitored, and includes examples such as aristolochic acid nephropathy and alkaloid‑related nephrotoxicity, with toxicity potentially enhanced by volume depletion or other illness/medications; classic supplement examples include creatine linked to allergic interstitial nephritis and excess vitamin C (ascorbic acid) leading to tubular calcium oxalate crystal deposition; healthcare providers are encouraged to routinely inquire about herbal remedy use and recommend stopping any unprescribed alternative remedy that may pose a kidney health threat.

### Differences in safety of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in patients with osteoarthritis and patients with rheumatoid arthritis: a randomized clinical trial [^e0af12c3]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the relative risks of cardiovascular (CV), gastrointestinal (GI), and renal adverse events during long-term treatment with celecoxib, compared with ibuprofen and naproxen, in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Methods

A total of 24,081 patients with OA or RA who had a moderate or high risk for CV disease were enrolled internationally into a double-blind randomized controlled trial. Interventions included celecoxib at a dosage of 100–200 mg twice daily, ibuprofen at a dosage of 600–800 mg 3 times daily, or naproxen at a dosage of 375–500 mg twice daily. The main outcomes were the first occurrence of a major adverse CV event, GI event, or renal event, and mortality.

Results

In the subgroup of patients with OA, the risk of a major adverse CV event was significantly reduced when celecoxib was compared with ibuprofen (hazard ratio [HR] 0.84, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.72–0.99), but no significant difference was observed when celecoxib was compared with naproxen. In the RA subgroup, comparisons of celecoxib versus ibuprofen and celecoxib versus naproxen for the risk of major adverse CV events revealed HRs of 1.06 (95% CI 0.69–1.63) and 1.22 (95% CI 0.78–1.92), respectively. In the OA subgroup, comparisons of celecoxib versus ibuprofen for the risk of GI events showed an HR of 0.68 (95% CI 0.51–0.91), and a comparison of celecoxib versus naproxen showed an HR of 0.73 (95% CI 0.55–0.98). Duplicate comparisons in patients with RA revealed HRs of 0.48 (95% CI 0.22–1.07) and 0.54 (95% CI 0.24–1.24), respectively. In patients with OA, a comparison of celecoxib versus ibuprofen for the risk of renal events showed an HR of 0.58 (95% CI 0.40–0.82). In patients with RA, celecoxib treatment was associated with significantly lower mortality compared with naproxen treatment (HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.25–0.88).

Conclusion

Treatment with celecoxib at approved dosages conferred a similar or lower risk of CV, GI, and renal adverse events compared with treatment with ibuprofen or naproxen in patients with OA and patients with RA.

### Trends in use of prescription nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications before vs after implementation of a Florida law restricting opioid prescribing for acute pain [^fdb23090]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Despite our findings of nonsignificant increases in NSAID use, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the use of nonopioid prescription pain medications in the US increased from 2009 to 2018. Health care professionals may consider all available alternatives for pain treatment strategies. NSAIDs are considered an effective first-line therapy alternative to opioid medications for mild to moderate acute and chronic pain. Although NSAIDs are generally considered safe and are readily accessible over the counter to the public, there has been extensive reporting on the risks and safety issues associated with oral NSAIDs. Adverse effects of regular NSAID use include several different types of kidney injury and gastrointestinal bleeding. A previous studyreported increased use of prescription analgesics including NSAIDs from 2006 to 2015 among Medicare patients with chronic kidney disease. Another studyshowed that adverse cardiovascular events were associated with selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors and nonselective NSAIDs such as diclofenac. Thus, clinicians' decisions to prescribe NSAIDs for acute and chronic conditions require careful consideration and patient-specific approaches to deliver safe and effective care. Although shifting from opioid analgesics to NSAIDs could be clinically warranted at times, this practice might lead to patient harm in the form of (1) greater toxic effects and adverse events owing to the requirement of high doses of NSAIDs to achieve desired analgesia or (2) uncontrolled pain owing to a lack of analgesia altogether with the choice of NSAID products.

As many states increase their focus on safer dose recommendations and prescribing restrictions to reduce the potential for opioid misuse and diversion, early evaluations of these and other related opioid restriction policies have not shown a substantial decrease in opioid prescribing and dose recommendation. A recent study by Chua and colleaguesthat analyzed early evidence of opioid prescribing limits showed modest reductions in opioid prescribing associated with opioid prescribing limits that were already below the level allowed, no required daily dose restrictions, and clinicians not complying with prescribing limits. Additional clinical perspectives should be considered when designing legislation for safe opioid prescribing to address best practices for general pain care. Further insight into changes in use of treatment alternatives such as gabapentinoids, muscle relaxants, and benzodiazepines as well as changes in illicit drug use warrants exploration in future studies.

### Inflammation reduction pack [^2a918e85]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.

Renal Effects

Caution should be used when initiating treatment with diclofenac sodium delayed-release in patients with considerable dehydration.

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

Advanced Renal Disease

No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of diclofenac sodium delayed-release in patients with advanced renal disease. Therefore, treatment with diclofenac sodium delayed-release is not recommended in these patients with advanced renal disease. If diclofenac sodium delayed-release therapy must be initiated, close monitoring of the patient's renal function is advisable.

### A comparison of renal-related adverse drug reactions between rofecoxib and celecoxib, based on the World Health Organization / uppsala monitoring centre safety database [^45519709]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Two isoforms of cyclooxygenase (COX) have been identified, both of them inhibited by traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Inhibition of COX-2 has been associated with the therapeutic effects of NSAIDs, whereas inhibition of COX-1 is believed to be the cause of the adverse gastrointestinal effects associated with NSAID therapy. When administered at therapeutic doses, new COX-2-specific inhibitors inhibit only the COX-2 isoform.

Objective

This study sought to compare renal safety signals between the COX-2-specific inhibitors rofecoxib and celecoxib, based on spontaneous reports of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the World Health Organization/Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHO/UMC) safety database through the end of the second quarter 2000.

Methods

Disproportionality in the association between a particular drug and renal-related ADR was evaluated using a bayesian confidence propagation neural network method in which a statistical parameter, the information component (IC) value, was calculated for each drug-ADR combination. In this method, an IC value significantly greater than 0 implies that the association of a drug-ADR pair is stronger than background; the higher the IC value, the more the combination stands out from the background. The ratio of actual to expected numbers of ADRs was also used to assess disproportionality.

Results

As with traditional NSAIDs, both COX-2-specific inhibitors were associated with renal-related ADRs. However, the adverse renal impact of rofecoxib was significantly greater than that of celecoxib. IC values were significantly different for the following comparisons: water retention (1.97 rofecoxib vs 1.18 celecoxib; P < 0.01); abnormal renal function (2.38 vs 0.70; P < 0.01); renal failure (2.22 vs 1.09; P < 0.01); cardiac failure (2.39 vs 0.48; P < 0.01); and hypertension (2.15 vs 1.33; P < 0.01). In an additional analysis, celecoxib was shown to have a similar renal safety profile to that of diclofenac and ibuprofen.

Conclusions

Based on spontaneous ADR reports in the WHO/UMC safety database at the end of the second quarter 2000, this analysis indicates that rofecoxib has significantly greater renal toxicity than celecoxib or traditional NSAIDs. This negative renal impact may have the potential to increase the risk for serious cardiac and/or cerebrovascular events.

### Practice advisory on the appropriate use of NSAIDs in primary care [^f2e64365]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

The SCOT and PRECISION studies are useful in framing the evidence related to the CV safety of NSAIDs. SCOT enrolled patients aged 60 years and older with OA or RA and without established CV disease who were taking prescribed chronic nonselective NSAIDs. Switching to celecoxib resulted in a similar rate of CV events as continuing on prescribed nonselective NSAIDs; GI safety was improved with celecoxib, though more patients assigned to nonselective NSAIDs remained on treatment. PRECISION assessed the noninferiority of celecoxib compared with ibuprofen and naproxen with respect to the primary composite outcome of CV death, nonfatal MI or nonfatal stroke, also in patients with OA and RA. At approved dosages (mean daily dose 209 mg), celecoxib was associated with a significantly lower risk of GI events whereas overall CV safety was similar for the three drugs. However, allocation to ibuprofen compared with celecoxib was associated with a significant increase in systolic BP and a higher rate of new onset hypertension. Among patients with symptomatic arthritis who had at least a moderate CV risk, patients using naproxen or ibuprofen had a significantly higher risk of a major toxicity, including time to first occurrence of MACE, important GI events, renal events, and all-cause mortality. Among non-selective NSAIDs, naproxen may be preferred over ibuprofen. In one study, ibuprofen and diclofenac were associated with an increased early risk of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Further, the use of ibuprofen in patients receiving aspirin as secondary prevention of MI may abrogate the benefits of aspirin.

The MEDAL program similarly showed differences between a nonselective and a COX-2 selective NSAID in terms of BP effects. However, unlike PRECISION whose findings favored celecoxib compared with ibuprofen, the use of etoricoxib in MEDAL was associated with significantly increased systolic BP compared with diclofenac. A subsequent study concluded that baseline BP rather than the BP-elevating effects of etoricoxib explained the risk of thrombotic events.

Celecoxib may thus be associated with increased CV risk, but only at dosages that are substantially higher than recommended. Indeed, greater risk of MI and MACE have been documented for higher doses of NSAIDs, with risk in the case of MI also greatest during the first month of use. Greater CV risk may also be associated with older age, and related concerns regarding comorbidities and polypharmacy.

### Adverse renal effects of anti-inflammatory agents: evaluation of selective and nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitors [^379d18fa]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), i.e. nonselective cyclooxygenase COX inhibitors have well-documented nephrotoxicity. Adverse renal effects occur because of inhibition of the synthesis of cyclooxygenase-derived prostaglandins which act to modulate pathologic processes that would normally impair various renal functions. The introduction of the selective COX-2 inhibitors raised hope that this class of drugs would reduce injury in both the gastrointestinal tract and the kidneys. Animal and human data, however, suggest that COX-2 synthesized prostaglandins are important in the modulation of renal physiology during adverse conditions. Hence, it appears that these drugs are equal in causing nephrotoxicity as the nonselective COX inhibitors.

### Need to develop new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug formulations [^ac87b55c]. Clinical Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

In the management of pain, primary care physicians are often the first to diagnose and treat acute or chronic painful conditions. This places them in an important intersection to manage pain, in which safe and effective therapeutic options are paramount for their patients. For decades, NSAIDs have been routinely prescribed for relief of mild to moderate acute and chronic pain. Yet, safety and tolerability concerns associated with the use of this class of drugs continue to be an issue for patients and clinicians.

Objective

The objective of this review was to discuss the unmet medical needs of patients in the management of pain and inflammation, review the dose-dependent safety data associated with use of NSAIDs, and discuss the need to develop new NSAID formulations to improve safety and tolerability while maintaining efficacy.

Methods

We performed literature searches of the PubMed and Cochrane Library databases through December 2012 for articles in English that reported dose-dependent safety and tolerability data associated with use of NSAIDs.

Results

The risk of serious, dose-dependent adverse events involving the gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular system, and kidneys is associated with use of NSAIDs. On the basis of these findings, the US Food and Drug Administration has requested that the package insert for all NSAIDs be revised to include a boxed warning highlighting the potential increased risk of cardiovascular events and the risk of serious, and potentially life-threatening, gastrointestinal tract bleeding. While using lower dosages of a particular NSAID may be associated with lower rates of adverse events, maintaining the clinical efficacy of standard NSAID dosages remains a challenge.

Conclusions

There is a need to develop new and effective NSAID formulations to minimize the safety and tolerability concerns associated with currently available NSAIDs, yet maintain efficacy in management of inflammation and pain.
