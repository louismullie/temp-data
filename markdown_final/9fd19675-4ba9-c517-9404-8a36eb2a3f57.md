## Question

Treatment for partial acl tear

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment options for a partial ACL tear. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining partial ACL tears and their epidemiology. Then, I should verify diagnostic accuracy and the gold standard. Next, I will examine the natural history and risk of progression. After that, I need to outline nonoperative management, including indications, rehabilitation, and outcomes. Then, I should review surgical options, including selective bundle augmentation, primary repair, and traditional reconstruction, with outcomes and risks. Finally, I will integrate decision factors, special populations, and a practical algorithm, and close with a concise, evidence-based recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the definition and prevalence so I don't anchor on a misleading premise. Partial ACL tears are injuries in which one of the two functional bundles (anteromedial or posterolateral) remains macroscopically intact, accounting for roughly 10% to 27% of isolated ACL injuries, and they span a spectrum from minimal fiber disruption to near-complete rupture of one bundle, which complicates both diagnosis and prognosis [^164d8cc4] [^035a0499].

> Wait, let me verify diagnostic accuracy before I jump to treatment implications. MRI sensitivity for partial tears is modest, around 40% to 75%, whereas arthroscopy remains the gold standard for confirming bundle integrity. Examination under anesthesia can overcall partial tears, and dynamic ultrasound has high accuracy for complete tears but poor sensitivity for partial tears, so I should not rely on ultrasound to confirm a partial tear in isolation [^9076b268] [^035a0499] [^33d13d5c].

> I need to check the natural history to frame risk discussions. In young, active patients managed nonoperatively, progression to complete rupture occurs in about 39%, and delayed reconstruction is associated with higher rates of secondary meniscal tears and cartilage injury; importantly, osteoarthritis risk is multifactorial and not clearly mitigated by surgery alone, though early reconstruction may reduce secondary meniscal pathology [^notfound] [^bcbc531e] [^7ab88faa].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about nonoperative care; I should confirm when it is appropriate and what outcomes to expect. Nonoperative management is reasonable for patients with minimal instability, low-demand activity goals, or those who achieve functional stability through rehabilitation; structured programs emphasize swelling control, range of motion, progressive strengthening, neuromuscular and perturbation training, and sport-specific drills, with return-to-sport decisions based on criteria rather than time alone; however, persistent giving-way or functional instability should prompt surgical referral [^199f7010] [^0540b267] [^69ab76f9].

> Let me consider surgical options carefully, starting with selective bundle augmentation. The theoretical advantage is preservation of the intact bundle's vascularity and proprioception, and small series suggest biomechanical and clinical outcomes comparable to double-bundle reconstruction in carefully selected partial tears; however, evidence quality is low and patient selection is critical, so I should confirm bundle integrity arthroscopically before choosing augmentation over complete reconstruction [^446c9b38] [^a51cf9ab] [^485c65e6].

> Hmm, wait a minute, primary repair has been revisited; I should double-check its role. Arthroscopic primary repair with biologic augmentation has shown promising short-term results in highly selected proximal partial tears with excellent tissue quality, but long-term durability remains uncertain and failure rates around 27% have been reported in broader series; given this, repair should be reserved for meticulously selected cases and not generalized to routine practice [^d7175b56] [^a8f61e14].

> I should confirm the default surgical standard when instability is present or goals demand it. Traditional single-bundle ACL reconstruction remains the most evidence-supported option for nonfunctional partial tears, with strong recommendations favoring reconstruction over repair due to lower revision risk; early reconstruction, when indicated, reduces secondary meniscal and cartilage injuries compared with delayed surgery, though timing should balance motion recovery and concomitant injuries [^adb52b37] [^f3308fd7] [^7ab88faa].

> Next, I should review decision factors so counseling is individualized. Age, activity level, sport demands, baseline laxity, and concomitant meniscal or chondral lesions all influence outcomes; in highly active patients pursuing pivoting sports, early anatomic reconstruction is favored to mitigate secondary injuries, whereas patients aiming for straight-plane activities may do well with rehabilitation alone; shared decision-making is essential, and patients should be counseled that neither strategy guarantees normal kinematics or eliminates osteoarthritis risk [^6a9d2699] [^30f2ebf4] [^b0f1ed54].

> But wait, what if the patient is skeletally immature or has a concomitant MCL injury; I need to ensure I address special scenarios. In children and adolescents, modern physeal-sparing or transphyseal techniques enable safe reconstruction with good outcomes, and delayed treatment risks secondary meniscal and chondral damage; for combined ACL/MCL injuries, most advocate delaying ACL reconstruction until MCL healing and range of motion return, with MCL management individualized to persistent valgus instability [^970b69f1] [^2d0dc573] [^6cf04554].

> I should double-check meniscal considerations because they often coexist and alter management. Meniscal repair should be prioritized when feasible, especially in younger patients, as it reduces osteoarthritis risk compared with meniscectomy; when meniscal tears accompany ACL injury, concomitant ACL reconstruction improves meniscal healing, and delays in ACL treatment increase secondary meniscal tears and meniscectomy rates, reinforcing the value of timely stabilization when instability is present [^b52b39a5] [^6e93cf27] [^bcbc531e].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm without oversimplifying. First, confirm the diagnosis with MRI and clinical examination, recognizing MRI's limited sensitivity for partial tears and reserving arthroscopy for diagnostic uncertainty or surgical planning. Second, assess functional stability and activity goals; stable, low-demand patients should undergo structured rehabilitation with clear return-to-sport criteria and close follow-up for progression. Third, unstable or high-demand patients should be offered anatomic ACL reconstruction, with selective bundle augmentation considered only when the intact bundle is confirmed arthroscopically and tissue quality is excellent. Fourth, incorporate concomitant injuries, especially meniscal pathology, into the plan, aiming for repair when indicated and avoiding unnecessary delays that increase secondary damage [^164d8cc4] [^199f7010] [^7ab88faa].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the recommendation matches the evidence and patient context. For partial ACL tears, both nonoperative rehabilitation and surgical reconstruction are acceptable, with the choice driven by functional instability, activity demands, and concomitant injuries; nonoperative care is reasonable for stable, low-demand patients, whereas anatomic ACL reconstruction is preferred for those with persistent instability or high-demand athletic goals, and emerging techniques like selective bundle augmentation or primary repair should be reserved for carefully selected cases until higher-quality comparative data emerge [^6a9d2699] [^adb52b37] [^d7175b56].

---

Partial ACL tears can be managed with **conservative care or surgery**, depending on stability, activity level, and patient goals [^6a9d2699]. Conservative treatment with **structured rehabilitation** is appropriate for stable knees and low-demand patients, with 70–80% returning to activity and ~39% risk of progression to complete tear in young, active patients [^ad469d70]. Surgery is indicated for **persistent instability** or high-demand athletes, with **ACL reconstruction** (single- or double-bundle) as the gold standard; selective bundle augmentation is a promising option in partial tears with an intact bundle, but evidence is limited [^a51cf9ab] [^446c9b38]. Early reconstruction reduces secondary meniscal and cartilage injuries, especially in young, active patients [^bcbc531e] [^7ab88faa]. Return-to-sport decisions should be **criteria-based**, with functional testing and patient-reported outcomes guiding clearance [^a2b901fe].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Accurate diagnosis is essential for **management**. MRI is the primary imaging modality, with sensitivity and specificity for partial ACL tears of 40–75% and 62–89%, respectively [^9076b268]. Arthroscopy remains the **gold standard** for definitive diagnosis and assessment of bundle integrity [^035a0499]. Clinical examination, including Lachman, anterior drawer, and pivot-shift tests, helps assess instability and guide treatment decisions [^notfound].

---

## Conservative management

Conservative management is appropriate for patients with **stable knees**, low activity demands, or those who achieve functional stability through rehabilitation [^6a9d2699]. Structured rehabilitation focuses on:

- **Reducing swelling and pain**: Cryotherapy, NSAIDs, and electrotherapy.
- **Restoring range of motion**: Progressive flexion and extension exercises.
- **Strengthening**: Quadriceps, hamstrings, and hip muscles.
- **Neuromuscular training**: Balance, proprioception, and sport-specific drills.
- **Functional testing**: Hop tests, strength symmetry, and patient-reported outcomes (IKDC, KOOS) to guide return-to-sport decisions [^a2b901fe].

Conservative management achieves **70–80% return to activity**, but ~39% of young, active patients progress to complete tears, often with concomitant meniscal injuries [^ad469d70].

---

## Surgical management

Surgery is indicated for patients with **persistent instability**, high activity demands, or failure of conservative treatment [^6a9d2699]. Options include:

| **Surgical technique** | **Indications** | **Outcomes** |
|-|-|-|
| ACL reconstruction (single-bundle) | - Complete ACL tears <br/> - High-grade partial tears with instability | - Good to excellent outcomes <br/> - Low revision rates <br/> - High return-to-sport rates [^notfound] |
| ACL reconstruction (double-bundle) | - Complete ACL tears <br/> - High-demand athletes | - Superior rotational stability <br/> - Comparable clinical outcomes to single-bundle [^notfound] |
| Selective bundle augmentation | - Partial tears with intact bundle <br/> - Preserves native tissue | - Promising results <br/> - Limited evidence <br/> - Potential benefits in proprioception and vascularity [^446c9b38] [^a51cf9ab] |

---

Early reconstruction (within 3–6 months) reduces the risk of secondary meniscal and cartilage injuries, particularly in young, active patients [^bcbc531e] [^7ab88faa].

---

## Factors influencing treatment choice

Treatment decisions should be **individualized** based on:

- **Patient factors**: Age, activity level, occupation, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^30f2ebf4].
- **Injury factors**: Degree of instability, bundle involvement, concomitant meniscal or cartilage injuries [^7cf110e8].
- **Evidence-based guidelines**: AAOS and Panther Symposium consensus statements emphasize shared decision-making and patient-centered care [^c2897e9b] [^30f2ebf4].

---

## Rehabilitation protocols

Rehabilitation is essential after both conservative and surgical management, with **criteria-based progression** [^0540b267]:

- **Phase 1 (0–2 weeks)**: Control swelling, restore ROM, initiate quadriceps activation.
- **Phase 2 (2–6 weeks)**: Progressive strengthening, closed-chain exercises, proprioception training.
- **Phase 3 (6–12 weeks)**: Advanced strengthening, sport-specific drills, gradual return to activity.
- **Phase 4 (3–6 months)**: Functional testing, return-to-sport clearance, ongoing injury prevention [^a2b901fe].

---

## Long-term outcomes

Long-term outcomes vary by treatment and patient factors. Conservative management has a **39% risk of progression** to complete tear and increased risk of meniscal injuries, while surgical reconstruction provides stable, predictable outcomes with lower revision rates but carries surgical risks (infection, stiffness, graft failure) [^ad469d70] [^f419b103]. Osteoarthritis risk is multifactorial and influenced by concomitant injuries and treatment timing [^ad469d70].

---

## Current research and controversies

Current research focuses on **identifying predictors of successful conservative management**, optimizing surgical techniques (e.g. selective bundle augmentation), and evaluating long-term outcomes. Controversies include the role of biologics, timing of surgery, and the best rehabilitation protocols [^a8f61e14] [^66095fd5] [^0540b267].

---

Partial ACL tears can be managed conservatively or surgically, with the choice guided by stability, activity level, and patient goals. Conservative care works for stable knees, but **young, active patients have a high risk of progression**; surgery is indicated for instability or high-demand athletes, with ACL reconstruction as the gold standard and selective bundle augmentation as a promising option in partial tears with an intact bundle [^6a9d2699] [^adb52b37] [^446c9b38].

### Management of partial tears of the anterior cruciate ligament: a review of the anatomy, diagnosis, and treatment [^164d8cc4]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2021). Medium credibility.

Partial anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears comprise an estimated 10% to 27% of isolated ACL injuries. Partial ACL tears may be challenging to clinically diagnose. We reviewed relevant studies focusing on the anatomy, diagnosis, imaging, and treatment of a partial injury with the goal of providing guidance to clinicians. Although a comprehensive patient history, thorough clinical examination, and imaging studies are helpful in arriving at a diagnosis, the benchmark for diagnosis remains visualization and examination of the ACL at the time of knee arthroscopy. Currently, limited data exist about the long-term outcomes of nonsurgical treatment. Some studies demonstrate that younger, active patients have the risk of progressing to a complete ACL rupture with conservative treatment. The decision to proceed with surgery is based on careful history and physical examination findings that suggest either a "functional" or "nonfunctional" ACL. Surgical treatment consists of augmenting the intact bundle with a selective bundle reconstruction versus a traditional ACL reconstruction. Selective bundle reconstruction has limited data available but is an option. The best evidence supports traditional ACL reconstruction for the surgical management of patients with documented nonfunctional partial tears of the ACL.

### Is primary arthroscopic repair using the pulley technique an effective treatment for partial proximal ACL tears? [^d7175b56]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Attention has recently been paid to primary arthroscopic repair to treat ACL tears because of the disadvantages associated with reconstruction. However, there remain many unanswered questions and concerns about its application in the treatment of ACL tears.

Questions/Purposes

(1) Does primary arthroscopic repair using the pulley technique result in satisfactory ROM (a functional ROM with a flexion contracture of 30° or less), knee stability, and functional scores in patients with partial proximal ACL tears? (2) What complications are associated with primary arthroscopic repair using the pulley technique in patients with partial proximal ACL tears?

Methods

Between January 2014 and March 2016, we treated 23 patients surgically who had partial proximal ACL tears and excellent tissue quality (defined as a remnant with mild interstitial tearing and the ability to hold sutures). All patients meeting those two criteria were treated using primary arthroscopic repair using the pulley technique. During that period, this represented 13% (23 of 183) of the patients we treated surgically for an ACL tear. Patients were excluded if they had other ACL tear types, insufficient tissue quality (defined as a severely torn remnant that was not strong enough to hold sutures), multi-ligamentous injuries, or substantial arthrosis (chondromalacia greater than Outerbridge grade 3, most of which underwent conversion to ACL reconstruction). Clinical outcomes were assessed using ROM, the anterior drawer test, the Lachman test, Lysholm score, Tegner activity score, IKDC subjective score, and radiographs. Twenty-one patients were observed for a mean (range) period of 36 months (25–49), and two were lost to follow-up.

Results

At the most-recent follow-up examination, all patients achieved full extension and only one patient lacked full flexion, with a flexion contracture of 10°. Twenty patients had no instability on the anterior drawer test and Lachman test findings, and one patient had a 1 + anterior drawer test. The mean Lysholm score improved from a mean ± SD of 71 ± 9 before surgery to 94 ± 6 (mean difference 23 points [95% CI 20 to 25]; p < 0.001) at latest follow-up. The IKDC subjective score improved from 64 ± 10 to 86 ± 11 points (mean difference 22 points; p < 0.001). We found no difference in the Tegner score from before surgery to latest follow-up (6.3 ± 1.2 versus 6.1 ± 1.2; mean difference 0.2; p = 0.056). One patient re-ruptured his ACL 2 months after surgery in military training during an obstacle race. No complications such as infection, thrombosis, stiffness, patellofemoral pain, or implant failure were observed.

Conclusions

Primary arthroscopic repair using the pulley technique can achieve short-term clinical success in a carefully selected (the selection process includes first identifying the ACL injury pattern preoperatively with MRI, then confirming the diagnosis under arthroscopy, and deciding whether to perform a repair intraoperatively) subset of patients with partial proximal ACL tears and excellent tissue quality (defined as a remnant with mild interstitial tearing and the ability to hold sutures). Despite the promising clinical outcomes of our study, this technique should not be widely adopted unless it has been compared directly with ACL reconstruction, so future studies should be conducted to compare the clinical outcomes between this technique and ACL reconstruction, and longer-term follow-up is necessary to identify whether there is deterioration in the clinical outcomes over time.

### Treatment after anterior cruciate ligament injury: panther symposium ACL treatment consensus group [^ad469d70]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

A partial ACL injury progressed to a complete ACL tear in 39% of young active patients treated non-operative, with half of the complete tears presenting with a concomitant meniscal lesion at the time of reconstruction. Age ≤ 20 years and participation in pivoting contact sports were identified as significant risk factors for progression to a complete tear.

Conclusion: If patient-reported instability or severe episodes of giving way occur during the progressive rehabilitation, patients should be referred for anatomic ACL reconstruction.

Development of osteoarthritis after an ACL injury is multifactorial and evidence is inconclusive following operative or non-operative treatment.

Agree 23/23, 100%

Osteoarthritis is the most common joint disease, affecting not only the cartilage, but all other tissues of the joint as well. The pathomechanism of post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) has not been fully elucidated, but based on current research, the process of development of osteoarthritis is multifactorial. Injuries, like ACL ruptures, can affect the joint biomechanics and cause chondral and meniscal lesions, and thereby reduce the sustainability of the joint. Matrix metalloproteases are responsible for cartilage destruction and synovial inflammation, and have been shown to be elevated following ACL injury and reconstruction. A meta-analysis of 24 observational studies found a fourfold increased risk for PTOA after knee injuries, although the definition of an injury was largely heterogeneous among the analyzed studies. After ACL injury, the prevalence of PTOA is increased after both operative and non-operative treatments as compared to those without injury. Based on a recent systematic review with 41 included studies, the rate of OA after ACL reconstruction varied between 1 and 80%, with meniscectomy as the consistent risk factor for the development of OA. Although long-term outcome studies after ACL reconstruction are available, the technique has evolved in the recent years, with a shift from non-anatomic ACL reconstruction to anatomic ACL reconstruction, limiting conclusions on the possible protective effect of anatomic ACL reconstruction.

### Surgical management of partial tears of the anterior cruciate ligament [^a51cf9ab]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Partial anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears involving the posterolateral (PL) bundle can lead to rotatory laxity of the knee, while tears involving the anteromedial (AM) bundle result in abnormal anteroposterior laxity of the knee. In this systematic review, we examine the best evidence on the management of partial tears of the ACL.

Methods

A comprehensive search of several databases was performed from the inception of the database to December 2011, using various combinations of keywords focusing on clinical outcomes of human patients who had partial tears of ACL and who had undergone ACL augmentation. We evaluated the methodological quality of each article using the Coleman Methodology Score.

Results

Ten articles published in peer-reviewed journals were identified (392 males and 242 females), with a mean modified Coleman methodology of 66.1 ± 10.2. Only two studies compared standard ACL reconstruction and augmentation techniques. No study has a sample large enough to allow establishing guidelines. Validated and standardized proprioception assessment methods should be used to report outcomes. Imaging outcomes should be compared to functional outcomes, and a control group consisting of traditional complete ACL reconstruction should be present.

Conclusion

There is a need to perform appropriately powered randomized controlled trials presenting clinical outcome with homogeneous score systems to allow accurate statistical analysis. ACL augmentation technique, preserving the intact AM or PL bundle of the ACL, is encouraging but currently available evidences are too weak to support his routine use in clinical practice.

### The recovery trajectory of anterior cruciate ligament ruptures in randomised controlled trials: a systematic review and meta-analysis of operative and nonoperative treatments [^61c6663b]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study is a comprehensive systematic review concerning ACL tears, showing a multitude of RCTs involving ACL reconstruction with alternative techniques. It successfully illustrated the overarching trend in PROMs irrespective of reconstruction types and rehabilitation methods.

The paucity of studies centred on rehabilitation as a trial arm was a limitation. Additionally, patients that were in the rehabilitation arm of the study could opt for reconstruction. The ambiguity around whether these participants were integrated into the mean scores for the rehabilitation category or not could skew our study's conclusions. In addition, the inclusion of both partial and complete tears in our operative and nonoperative groups may influence the overall PROM score outcomes. We acknowledge that partial and complete tears might represent distinct patient populations. However, our primary objective was to evaluate the recovery trajectory following treatment, and as the treatment protocol remained consistent across the underlying diagnoses, we made the pragmatic decision to analyse both groups together.

Future review studies could consider the inclusion of non‐RCTs that follow‐up those patients within a nonoperative arm. In addition, we did not analyse the trends for those in differing age groups undergoing reconstruction or rehabilitation. Furthermore, we investigated PROMs which may not satisfy the complete picture of what an individual participant is interested in such as return to specific sports, rerupture rates, or the risk of other knee injuries.

For clinicians, this highlights the importance of setting realistic expectations around sport‐specific recovery, while recognising that PROMs remain useful tools for tracking broader aspects of functional recovery. Clinicians should consider supplementing PROMs with measures better suited to assess long‐term athletic recovery in ACL patients.

### Management of traumatic meniscus tears: the 2019 ESSKA meniscus consensus [^b52b39a5]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

13. What are the indications for the different treatment options for longitudinal traumatic meniscus tears in stable knees?

Preservation of the meniscus is the first-line option because the clinical and radiological long-term outcomes are worse after partial meniscectomy than meniscus repair.

In general, traumatic meniscus tears are treated with repair, left in situ, or partial meniscectomy. Repair and left in situ are the most favorable treatment options, whereas the latter option is recommended for stable tears of the lateral meniscus during ACL reconstructions (see question 9). Thus, repair is recommended for medial meniscus tears, unstable tears, such as bucket handle and double longitudinal tears, and isolated meniscus tears.

To date, repair and left in situ repairs have not been compared directly, but the healing rates for tears of the lateral meniscus during ACL reconstruction appear to be comparable for all three meniscus zones (zones 3 to 1) (Grade C).

Partial meniscectomy of traumatic meniscus tears should only be applied if the other two treatment options are not applicable, e.g. in complex tears, tears with a high degree of degeneration, flap tears or nonreducible bucket handle tears (Grade D).

### Treatment after anterior cruciate ligament injury: panther symposium ACL treatment consensus group [^69ab76f9]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

Of the 13 statements discussed by this working group, nine achieved unanimous consensus, two achieved non-unanimous consensus, one did not achieve consensus, and one was excluded due to redundancy in the information provided (Table 3). The 12 finalized statements, with supporting literature, are as follows.

Operative and non-operative treatments are both acceptable treatment options for ACL injury.

Agree 23/23, 100%

Table 3
Consensus statements on non-operative and operative treatments of ACL injury

After ACL injury, some patients are able to regain good functional knee stability following non-operative treatment entailing progressive rehabilitation and are able to return to pre-injury sports activity level without an ACL reconstruction (copers), but the identification of these patients has been challenging. In a prospective study, the combination of hop tests, muscle strength, subjective instability (episodes of giving way), and knee function was found to be a moderate predictive tool for the identification of potential copers. A randomized-controlled trial comparing operative and non-operative treatments in 121 young active, non-elite patients with isolated ACL tears demonstrated no superiority of either treatment with regard to patient-reported outcomes at 2- and 5-year follow-up. However, almost 40% of the patients who were initially assigned to the non-operative treatment group required delayed ACL reconstruction and 32% of the patients (29 menisci in 19 patients) had subsequent surgery for meniscal pathology during the 2 year follow-up period. In contrast, 34 patients (56%) who underwent the early ACL reconstruction also had meniscus treatment (24 partial resection and 10 fixation) simultaneous with the ACL reconstruction, but only 10% (6 meniscal injuries in 5 patients) in the operatively treated group had meniscal injuries that required surgical treatment during follow-up. With regard to knee laxity, as measured by KT-1000 and pivot shift test, non-operative treatment resulted in a larger anterior tibial translation (9.0 mm vs. 6.6 mm) and higher rate of rotatory laxity (positive pivot shift test: 78% vs. 25%). A matched-paired study based on the Swedish National ACL registry comparing operative and non-operative treatments after ACL injury reported superior results for quality of life, knee function, and symptoms at 1, 2, and 5 year follow-up for ACL reconstruction compared with non-operative treatment. Another prospective trial with highly active patients included 832 patients at baseline with sub-acute ACL tear, whereas 345 patients were initially screened for the possibility of non-operative treatment. Based on the results of various hop tests, subjective instability, and general knee function, 146 patients were classified as potential copers, and at the final follow-up after 10 years, only 25 patients had not undergone ACL reconstruction.

14. What are the indications for the different treatment options for radial traumatic meniscus tears (except root tears) in stable knees?

(a) Complete radial tears may exert a detrimental effect on the knee, because they potentially represent an almost complete loss of meniscus function. In general, traumatic radial meniscus tears are treated with repair, left in situ or partial meniscectomy. Radial tears of zones 1 and 2 should be repaired to restore the integrity of the rim in patients with or without concomitant ACL reconstruction. Only when the tear is technically not repairable or a retear of a failed repair occurs should partial meniscectomy be considered. Partial meniscectomy should not be the first-line treatment for tears of zone 1 and 2, because of its worse long-term outcome than repaired tears (Grade C).

(b) Nontreatment of the radial tear was also described as a treatment option for stable tears in all three zones (1–3) during concomitant ACL reconstruction. Despite the good clinical results, the healing rates of repeated arthroscopic surgeries were very low, and these studies were only mid-term follow-up studies. Thus, this treatment approach is not recommended (Grade D).

(c) In contrast, radial tears of zone 3 can be treated with a partial meniscectomy that preserves the peripheral wall. Some surgeons also prefer to repair the torn part of zones 1 and 2 and perform a partial resection of zone 3. However, no research studies compared this combined treatment with the repair of all three zones (Grade D).

15. Should posterolateral meniscus root tears be repaired?

Posterolateral meniscus root tears (PLMRT) are mainly traumatic injuries that frequently occur with ACL tears. These root tears should be repaired, particularly if the meniscofemoral ligament does not exist or is injured. The repair of PLMRT decreases meniscus extrusion (in the sagittal plane) and the risk of OA compared to untreated tears in patients with concomitant ACL reconstruction. However, no differences were observed in Lysholm scores and objective IKDC grading between treated and untreated PLMRT (Grade C).

### The recovery trajectory of anterior cruciate ligament ruptures in randomised controlled trials: a systematic review and meta-analysis of operative and nonoperative treatments [^aea36bae]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Purpose

The purpose of this research was to understand the trajectory of recovery following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction compared to nonoperative treatments.

Methods

A systematic review and meta‐analysis approach was used to evaluate randomised controlled trials (RCTs). A comprehensive search was conducted on databases including Medline, Embase, Web of Science and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up until 18 May 2023. The study focused on full‐text RCTs involving patients with partial or complete ACL tears. Included were studies focusing on patients undergoing ACL reconstruction or nonoperative care. The primary outcome was characterising the effects of treatments and tracking changes in International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Evaluation Form (IKDC) outcomes over time. The secondary outcome was characterising and tracking the changes of the knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score subscales, ACL‐quality‐of‐life questionnaire, Lysholm, Tegner and CKRS scores.

Results

A total of 84 RCTs were included. The pooled standardised mean changes for the IKDC compared with baseline were: 2.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.3–3.6) at 3 months, 2.2 (95% CI: 0.9–3.6) at 6 months, 2.2 (95% CI: 0.8–3.6) at 12 months and 2.3 (95% CI: 1.3–3.4) at 24 months. Graphs illustrating IKDC scores over time further emphasise these findings, showing a sustained improvement over time to 12 months, with a plateauing of scores past this time point. Our secondary outcome patient‐reported outcome measures (PROMs) also showed a similar pattern with scores plateauing at the 12‐months mark.

Conclusion

Our findings suggest that the IKDC score and other PROMs are effective for tracking recovery up to 12 months. Other PROMs show pain and daily activities generally recover within 6 months, and quality of life improves up to 12 months, but PROMs show minimal improvement beyond this period. This inconsistency with a return sport period indicates that PROMs may lack the sensitivity required to assess this aspect of recovery accurately.

### Rehabilitation following a minimally invasive procedure for the repair of a combined anterior cruciate and posterior cruciate ligament partial rupture in a 15-year-old athlete [^30316eda]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Study Design

Case report.

Background

The healing response procedure is a minimally invasive arthroscopic surgical technique used to stimulate healing in the treatment of partial cruciate ligament tears. The purpose of this report is to provide information on the surgical procedure, the postoperative rehabilitation, and the overall functional results in a patient who underwent such a procedure.

Case Description

A 15-year-old male, who sustained a partial tear of both the anterior cruciate and posterior cruciate ligament while playing football, underwent arthroscopic surgical management utilizing a healing response technique. Precautions concerning range of motion and resisted activities were followed postoperatively to protect the healing cruciate ligaments. The postoperative protocol consisted of 3 phases, culminating in return-to-sport training. Treatment incorporated cardiovascular, proprioceptive, strength, power, plyometric, and sport-specific activities. Treatment was progressed based on specific criteria emphasizing proper movement patterns and eccentric control during functional activities.

Outcomes

The patient attended 31 physical therapy sessions over 17 weeks. Strength improved from 3/5 to 5/5, knee range of motion returned to normal, Lower Extremity Functional Scale scores improved from 21/80 to 80/80, and successful outcomes on functional return-to-sport testing allowed the patient to return to competitive athletics.

Discussion

Primary repair of cruciate ligament tears has yielded poor results, and partial cruciate ligament tears may not require complete surgical reconstruction. The healing response technique offers a possible solution for the treatment of partial cruciate ligament tears. A criterion-based postoperative protocol was derived based on current evidence regarding rehabilitation following cruciate ligament reconstruction and evidence regarding lower extremity rehabilitation principles and injury prevention.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline summary: management of anterior cruciate ligament injuries [^11535b01]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

This Summary of Recommendations of the AAOS Management of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries: Evidence-based Clinical Practice Guideline contains a list of evidence-based prognostic and treatment recommendations (Table 1). Discussions of how each recommendation was developed and the complete evidence report are contained in the full guideline at. Readers are urged to consult the full guideline for the comprehensive evaluation of the available scientific studies. The recommendations were established using methods of evidence-based medicine that rigorously control for bias, enhance transparency, and promote reproducibility. An exhaustive literature search was conducted resulting initially in more than 1,100 papers for full review. The papers were then graded for quality and aligned with the work group's patients, interventions, and outcomes of concern. For CPG PICO (ie, population, intervention, comparison, and outcome) questions that returned no evidence from the systematic literature review, the work group used the established AAOS CPG methodology to generate one companion consensus statement that physicians may consider aspirating painful, tense effusions after knee injury with likely or confirmed ACL tear.

The Summary of Recommendations is not intended to stand alone. Medical care should be based on evidence, a physician's expert judgement, and the patient's circumstances, values, preferences, and rights. A patient-centered discussion understanding an individual patient's values and preferences can inform appropriate decision-making. The recommendations regarding the treatment of ACL tears are primarily focused on younger, more active individuals. Recommendations regarding surgical treatment are principally based on literature studying ACL tears as an isolated ligamentous injury rather than a multiligamentous injury (except for isolated ACL and MCL injury). A variety of mitigating circumstances, particularly related to patient age, preinjury activity, symptoms, and desired level of postinjury activity, may also be factors in the shared decision-making process.

A Strong recommendation means that the quality of the supporting evidence is high. A Moderate recommendation means that the benefits exceed the potential harm (or that the potential harm clearly exceeds the benefits in the case of a negative recommendation), but the quality/applicability of the supporting evidence is not as strong. A Limited option means that there is a lack of compelling evidence that has resulted in an unclear balance between benefits and potential harm. A Consensus option means that expert opinion supports the guideline recommendation, although there is no available realistic evidence that meets the inclusion criteria of the guideline's systematic review.

Outcome measures

Currently, there is no core outcome set for evaluating ACL IPPs. We have selected outcomes based on the relevant literature, and the expertise of senior review authors who are clinicians experienced in treating people with ACL injuries.

We will categorise the follow‐up for outcome data as early (one year or under), medium (more than one year but two years or under) and late (more than two years).

Critical outcomes

Number of participants with an ACL injury (e.g. sprain, partial tear or complete rupture); we will include ACL injury with clinical or radiological diagnosis
Number of participants with a complete ACL rupture (using clinical or radiological diagnosis)
Adverse effects that are presumed to be related to the intervention or those that are presumed to be indirectly related to the intervention
Validated patient‐reported outcome measures (PROMs), for example: International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Form Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)

Important outcomes

### Why perform an ACL augmentation? [^485c65e6]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

The objective of this article is to determine the importance of an intact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) stump and its role in the clinical outcome of an ACL reconstruction.

Method

A PubMed database search was conducted using the key words "anterior cruciate ligament healing" and "double-bundle structure". Articles concerning ACL healing, reconstruction, and rehabilitation were obtained. A total of 35 studies were incorporated in this article, and factors preset in the intact ACL stump were taken into consideration.

Results

Four factors were noted to be important in preserving the stump: protection in early rehabilitation, maintenance of vascular supply, preservation of proprioceptive receptors and may serve as reference for accurate tunnel placement. Also noted was the significance of the intact stump in the natural history, examination, and imaging of such injuries.

Conclusion

This study provides a detailed justification in preserving ACL remnants and their vital role in surgical reconstruction of partial anterior cruciate ligament tears.

### Rehabilitation after anterior cruciate ligament and meniscal injuries: a best-evidence synthesis of systematic reviews for the OPTIKNEE consensus [^0540b267]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

ACL and meniscal tears are the most common traumatic knee injuries in athletes and are expected to increase. Surgery to reconstruct the ACL or repair/partially remove a torn meniscus is often performed to restore mechanical stability, facilitate a return to competitive sport and prevent secondary injury. Yet, two-thirds of patients do not return to their pre-injury level of sport within the first year following ACL reconstruction (ACLR)and up to one-quarter sustain second ACL injuries. Young adults following meniscal surgery face a similar fate — although return to sport rates are higher (67%–89%),21% of repairs fail (ie, require secondary surgery). In the longer term, unacceptable knee symptoms, persistent functional deficits and impaired quality of life are common. Half of injured individuals will develop symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) within 10 years, regardless of operative or non-operative treatment.

Six different clinical practice guidelines emphasise the importance of active rehabilitation (ie, exercise therapy) following ACL injury (± meniscal injury) and reconstruction to restore muscle strength and lower limb function, reduce pain and symptoms, and safely return to competitive sport without reinjury. However, a systematic review focusing on ACL rehabilitation in clinical practice guidelines found conflicting recommendations and poor applicability — indicating barriers for clinicians to implement recommendations into practice. There is little consensus regarding the optimal components of ACL rehabilitation, reflecting a lack of evidence (and/or poor-quality evidence) underpinning these guidelines and leading to substantial heterogeneity in rehabilitation protocols. The same is true for traumatic meniscal injuries. The 2018 clinical practice guideline for meniscal lesion assessment and treatment overwhelmingly focuses on older adults with degenerative pathology associated with OA — a very different population (likely with distinct rehabilitation goals and expectations) to young adults with traumatic injuries.

### Is a partial anterior cruciate ligament tear truly Partial? A clinical, arthroscopic, and histologic investigation [^035a0499]. Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

(1) To determine whether examination under anesthesia (EUA) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an accurate means for determining patient selection for a selective-bundle reconstruction, (2) to determine whether the preoperative clinical assessment correlates with the arthroscopic examination, and (3) to examine histologically whether a partial anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear is truly partial in terms of vascular insult.

Methods

This prospective, nonrandomized cohort study included 95 patients who underwent primary ACL reconstruction from January 2013 through May 2014. All patients underwent an EUA, MRI, and arthroscopic evaluation. In patients with partial ACL tears, the intact bundle was resected and underwent histologic examination. The χ² test was used to compare EUA and MRI in the detection of partial tears.

Results

Of the 95 patients included, 40 (42%) had EUA findings consistent with a partial ACL tear whereas 22 (23%) had MRI findings interpreted as showing a partial ACL tear. Arthroscopic examination confirmed a partial ACL tear in only 11 patients (12%). The sensitivity of EUA and MRI in the detection of partial ACL tears was 100% and 90.9%, and the specificity was 65% and 85.7%, respectively. The χ² test suggested statistically significant associations between the method of evaluation and diagnostic outcome [χ²(1) = 7.83, P = 0.005]. MRI was 1.24 times more likely to correctly identify a partial tear (95% confidence interval, 1.06–1.45). EUA was 2.23 times as likely to incorrectly identify a partial tear (95% confidence interval, 1.24–4.02). The histologic analysis showed increased numbers of lymphocytes, absent polymorphonuclear leukocytes, predominant fibroblasts, neovascularization, and variable collagen orientation.

Conclusions

There is a disparity between EUA, MRI, and arthroscopic findings in the evaluation of partial ACL tears. Arthroscopy remains the gold standard for diagnosing the macroscopic integrity of the intact bundle. Microscopic analysis reveals that the integrity of the remaining intact ligament material is altered and may show a histologic response similar to a complete ACL rupture.

### Clinical relevance and imaging features of isolated single bundle anterior cruciate tear and single bundle augmentation [^1d6e4bbd]. Clinical Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) consists of two anatomic and functional bundles, the anteromedial and posterolateral bundle. Depending on the mechanism of injury, there are different injury patterns, demonstrating a wide spectrum of partial ACL tears. Single bundle partial ACL tears can be treated with augmentation. Theoretically, sparing the intact parts of the ACL may increase vascularization and proprioception and may result in better stability and improved clinical outcome for the patient. In this article, we review the anatomy and function of ACL bundles and demonstrate cases of single bundle ACL tear with subsequent augmentation.

### Anterior cruciate ligament tears treated with percutaneous injection of autologous bone marrow nucleated cells: a case series [^1d98e89c]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is a commonly injured knee ligament in the United States population, and accordingly, there are more than 150,000 ACL surgical reconstruction procedures performed per year. The ACL can be torn completely, which has a clear natural history of resulting in long-term instability in 15%–66% of patients, or be partial torn, in which the natural history is less clear. A review by Pujol et al showed that partial ACL tears could have a favorable short- to medium-term outcome with nonoperative management if sports activity was limited. Surgical indications for both partial and complete ACL ruptures are continued instability, or ligament injury and returning to pivoting sport.

Although ACL reconstruction can have good success rates, one of the potential adverse outcomes following ACL reconstruction is lack of restoration of full physiologic movement, due to the biomechanically disadvantageous location of the graft placement. This leads to increased tibial rotation and impaired neuromuscular control during high-demand activities among patients with ACL grafts, potentially resulting in increased cartilage load and thus higher risk of reinjury. For these and other reasons, although surgical reconstruction remains a standard and common procedure for management of ACL tears, alternative treatments are needed that can both address the integrity of the ligament and at the same time maintain the biomechanical competence of the knee joint.

### Thermal modification of partial tears of the anterior cruciate ligament [^ad9af41a]. Arthroscopy (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

Partial tears of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) are common, representing 10% to 28% of all ACL tears. Untreated partial tears of the ACL may go on to complete rupture in up to 42% of cases, and as few as 30% of patients return to their preinjury activity level. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of thermal modification for the treatment of partial tears of the ACL.

Type Of Study

A prospective, nonrandomized consecutive case series.

Methods

Thirteen patients with a partial tear of a native ACL were treated with thermal modification of the ACL. All patients had a preoperative office examination significant for an end-point to Lachman examination and pivot-glide. All patients had bilateral preoperative KT-1000 measurements. All tears were confirmed by arthroscopy to constitute a 50% or less loss of structural integrity of the ligament. The ACL underwent thermal modification using the Oratec thermal probe (Oratec Interventions, Menlo Park, CA), and was examined by intraoperative KT-1000 testing. Patients were evaluated postoperatively at 6 weeks, and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months by office examination and functional outcome scoring.

Results

KT-1000 arthrometer testing revealed a mean side-to-side difference of 4.35 mm preoperatively (SD = 1.1 mm). At the most recent follow-up, averaging 23 months (range, 18 to 28 months), 10 patients had a negative Lachman examination and no pivot-shift. Two patients had persistent grade II Lachman and complaints of giving way 3 months postoperative. Both patients underwent ACL reconstruction. One patient was lost to follow-up. Of the remaining 10 patients, all patients achieved full extension, and the average flexion range of motion was 131 degrees (SD = 5.6). Compared with the preoperative KT-1000 arthrometer testing, the most recent evaluation revealed a decrease in mean side-to-side difference to 1.9 mm (SD = 1.5 mm). At most recent follow-up, the mean Lysholm score was 96.3 (SD = 4.4), the mean Tegner score was 6.1 (SD = 1.2), and the mean Cincinnati score was 94 (SD = 3.0).

Conclusions

With cautious application, thermal modification may be a viable treatment option for partial tears of the ACL in a select subset of patients. Further investigation is necessary to determine the long-term effectiveness of this procedure.

### The formal EU-US meniscus rehabilitation 2024 consensus: an ESSKA-AOSSM-AASPT initiative. part I-rehabilitation management after meniscus surgery (meniscectomy, repair and reconstruction) [^99d6f5f5]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Meniscus surgery is one of the most common procedures performed worldwide. The indications of treatment and practice have evolved with time due to the improved knowledge of the biomechanics of the meniscus and the consequences of extensive meniscectomies. Recent studies focus on the indications for surgery, and if needed, which surgery preserves as much meniscus tissue as possible while providing the best short‐ and long‐term functional results.

Following these trends, the European Society for Sports Traumatology and Arthroscopy (ESSKA) initiated the European Meniscus Consensus Project in 2016. The aim of the first part was to provide a reference document for the management of degenerative meniscus lesions (DMLs), based both on scientific literature and balanced clinical expertise. Following this, arthroscopic partial meniscectomy became not a first but a second‐line treatment for treating DML. In 2019, the second ESSKA meniscus consensus provided recommendations for the surgical treatment of Traumatic meniscus tears. The main message of this second consensus was that preservation of the meniscus (including repair or partial meniscectomy) should be the first treatment philosophy for traumatic tears. Post‐operative rehabilitation after meniscus surgery may vary with time, location/country, expertise and habit. Detailed rehabilitation decisions were not covered by the previous consensuses.

For anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, robust rehabilitation protocols and recommendations exist. For the meniscus, literature is still scarce. While many indications and techniques of meniscus surgery are made based on sufficient evidence, many surgeons, sports medicine doctors and physiotherapists still face multiple options where recommendations are lacking, especially for the post‐operative care after meniscus surgery. That is the reason why ESSKA, the American Orthopedic Society for Sports Medicine (AOSSM) and the American Academy of Sports Physical Therapy (AASPT), three main scientific societies working around meniscus pathology and rehabilitation, decided to cover the topic together in order to give unified messages.

The aim of this formal consensus was to provide recommendations for the usage of rehabilitation (including physical therapy) for patients with symptomatic menisci. The first part of the consensus will focus on rehabilitation performed after any surgical treatment for DMLs, traumatic meniscus tears (meniscectomy or repair) or meniscus reconstruction.

The second part of the consensus will cover prevention, non‐operative treatment and return to sports (RTS) modalities. The full version of the consensus project can also be read in more detail on the ESSKA website and on the ESSKA Academy Website (Open Access).

Surgical treatment vs. physical therapy for low- or intermediate-grade partial-thickness tears — in the absence of reliable evidence, it is the opinion of the workgroup that physical therapy can improve outcomes in patients with low-grade or intermediate-grade partial-thickness rotator cuff tears, and in patients with persistent pain and functional impairment after appropriate non-operative treatment, surgery can improve outcomes. Quality of Evidence: Consensus. Strength of Option: Consensus. There is no supporting evidence, or limited level evidence was downgraded due to major concerns addressed in the EtD framework, and in the absence of sufficient evidence, the guideline workgroup is making a recommendation based on their clinical opinion.

### Meniscectomy is associated with a higher rate of osteoarthritis compared to meniscal repair following acute tears: a meta-analysis [^6e93cf27]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

The majority of included studies excluded patients with concurrent knee ligament injury. Person et al. did not exclude ACL injuries, but performed statistical adjustments, when necessary, for age and sex, before evaluating the results. However, meniscal injuries are frequently associated with cruciate ligament injuries, especially tears of the anterior cruciate ligament. When ACL reconstruction is performed concomitantly with the repair of meniscal tears, significantly better healing of meniscal tears is reported. Conversely, meniscal repair leads to increased ACL stability, and ACL reconstruction also benefits from meniscal repair. Therefore, seven of the included studies required ACL injury as an inclusion criterion. The applicability of the results to knees without ACL damage is uncertain.

Between studies heterogeneity in the resection technique are evident. Only three studies did not define the type of meniscectomy in detail. The other authors conducted a partial meniscectomy. An arthroscopic procedure for partial meniscectomy is used in five studies. Despite the results of the repair and controversies in the current literature, partial resection continues to be indicated in complex, degenerative, avascular tears, or following failure of a previous meniscal repair. Partial meniscectomy is believed to achieve faster recovery and symptoms remission, is simple to perform and requires a short operation time.

### 2018 international olympic committee consensus statement on prevention, diagnosis and management of paediatric anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries [^74456552]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Specific surgical treatment considerations

Combined ACL and fibular collateral ligament injuries

Use fluoroscopy prior to placing suture anchors for a repair, or for tunnel reaming for a concurrent ligament reconstruction, to evaluate tunnel position in relation to the physes.

Combined ACL and posterior cruciate ligament injuries

Non-surgical treatment may be appropriate for partial posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) tears or non-displaced avulsion injuries. PCL reconstruction is a relatively safe and viable treatment option in patients with multiligament injuries. Using a tibial inlay technique with a modified femoral tunnel location avoids transphyseal drilling, although there are no high-quality studies of this technique in children.

True knee dislocation

Perform a reduction by manipulating the tibia relative to the femur. Avoid forceful hypertension or rotation, to minimise the risk for damage to cartilaginous and/or neurovascular structures. Following reduction, a dynamic knee brace can be applied (for at least 12 weeks) to prevent further intra-articular damage and to help hold the knee reducedwhile further treatment is planned. Ultimately, reconstruction of the ACL and PCL in combination with repair/reconstruction of additional ligaments (as needed) is the appropriate treatment.

Section 5: paediatric patient-reported outcome measures

This section addresses the fundamental clinical question: how does the clinician measure outcomes that are relevant to the child with an ACL injury? Assessing patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) provides insights into aspects of the patient's function that cannot be evaluated with clinical tests or imaging. Because of this, evaluating PROMs is important when managing the child with an ACL injury, and when conducting research in this field.

Valid outcome instruments must have appropriate measurement properties, including reliability, validity (content, criterion and construct) and responsiveness. Instruments that were developed for adults may not be valid for children and adolescents. Paediatric patients have different levels of comprehension (this age group includes a spectrum of comprehension abilities from younger children to older adolescents) and interpretation of instruments. Most importantly, paediatric patients may value different outcomes when evaluating their knee function, and instruments must reflect the issues that are important to children and adolescents.

16. Should a posteromedial meniscus root tear be repaired?

Medial meniscus roots tears may be traumatic; however, they generally present a degenerative nature. Root repair is typically recommended because it results in a better clinical outcome than conservative treatment and partial meniscectomy and may also reduce the risk of progression of OA. The degree of OA plays an important role in determining the outcome: the higher the degree of OA, the less favorable the results (Grade C).

17. What is the optimal timing of a successful repair of stable and unstable meniscus tears?

A repair that is completed as early as possible appears to produce a better clinical outcome, including a decreased failure rate (Table 2). In general, acutely repaired meniscus tears achieve superior results compared to chronically repaired tears (Table 2). However, repaired chronic meniscus tears achieve good to excellent results and thus should be repaired, when indicated, instead of partially resected (Table 2) (Grade C).

Table 2

18. What is the best method to treat an acute, nonreducible (= locked) bucket handle meniscus tear in combination with an ACL tear in the office or emergency room?

(a) Chronic ACL tear: In a noninflammatory knee with an ACL injury that occurred several weeks or more ago and an acute, nonreducible bucket handle meniscus tear, the preferred treatment is the prompt repair of the meniscus and the simultaneous reconstruction of the ACL. The group does not recommend a two-stage treatment with an initial repair of the meniscus tear and secondary reconstruction of the ACL, as proposed by other researchers (Grade C).

(b) Acute ACL tear: Similarly, in an acutely injured knee with an ACL tear and a nonreducible bucket handle meniscus tear, the preferred treatment is the prompt repair of the meniscus and the possible reconstruction of the ACL in the same procedure. One study recommended a concomitant ACL reconstruction and meniscus repair if it was able to be completed within approximately 60 h after the injury. An increase in the arthrofibrosis rate was not reported when patients received ACL reconstruction within the first 60 h compared to delayed surgery (Grade C).

### New meniscal tears after ACL injury: what is the risk? A systematic review protocol [^f066f2fc]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Secondary meniscal tears after ACL injuries increase the risk of knee osteoarthritis. The current literature on secondary meniscal injuries after ACL injury is not consistent and may have methodological shortcomings. This protocol describes the methods of a systematic review investigating the rate of secondary meniscal injuries in children and adults after treatment (operative or non-operative) for ACL injury.

Methods

We will search electronic databases (Embase, Ovid Medline, Cochrane, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), SPORTDiscus, PEDro and Google Scholar) from database inception. Extracted data will include demographic data, methodology, intervention details and patient outcomes. Risk of bias will be assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa checklist for cohort studies. Article screening, eligibility assessment, risk of bias assessment and data extraction will be performed in duplicate by independent reviewers. A proportion meta-analysis will be performed if studies are homogeneous (I² < 75%). If meta-analysis is precluded, data will be synthesised descriptively using best-evidence synthesis. The strength of recommendations and quality of evidence will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation working group methodology.

Ethics and Dissemination

### Long-term outcomes of primary repair of the anterior cruciate ligament combined with biologic healing augmentation to treat incomplete tears [^a8f61e14]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical treatment to repair partial anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury without reconstruction has demonstrated inconsistent clinical success.

Purpose

To examine the long-term clinical outcomes of primary ACL repair combined with biologic healing augmentation in patients with symptomatic partial ACL tears.

Study Design

Case series; Level of evidence, 4.

Methods

50 patients (mean age, 29.5 years) with a partial ACL tear and symptomatic knee instability were treated with primary ligament repair in conjunction with marrow stimulation and followed prospectively for a mean duration of 10.2 years (range, 5.3–14.3 years). Comparative analysis of preinjury, preoperative, and postoperative scores using patient-reported assessment instruments was performed to examine clinical outcomes. Correlation of final outcome scores with patient age, type of ACL tear, side-to-side difference in ligamentous laxity, and body mass index (BMI) was performed through use of Spearman rank analysis.

Results

44 patients were available for assessment at final follow-up. The median Tegner Activity Scale score of 7 at final follow-up was the same as the preinjury median score of 7 (P = 0.128). The mean Marx Activity Scale, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective, and Lysholm Knee Questionnaire scores were 10.8, 90.4, and 96.2, respectively, at final follow-up. Mean final Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) subset assessments of Pain, Symptoms, Activities of Daily Living, Sports, and Quality of Life were 98.6, 97.5, 99.7, 94.3, and 95.6, respectively. Secondary ACL insufficiency occurred in 27% of patients. Clinical outcome scores were similar for all scoring instruments between patients treated for an associated diagnosis of meniscal or articular cartilage injury. No significant correlations of age, BMI, ACL tear type, or laxity and final IKDC Subjective, Lysholm, or KOOS scores were found. Analysis revealed a negative correlation of patient age and Tegner score at preinjury (rₛ = -0.333, P = 0.022) and at final follow-up (rₛ = -0.376, P = 0.013). The mean side-to-side difference in ligamentous laxity of 3.4 mm at short-term follow-up in those patients who developed secondary ACL insufficiency over the duration of follow-up was significantly greater than the mean of 0.9 mm in those who did not (P = 0.010).

Conclusion

Primary ACL repair combined with biologic healing augmentation to treat select cases of knee instability secondary to incomplete ACL rupture demonstrated good to excellent long-term outcomes in this cohort for those patients who did not experience secondary ACL insufficiency, with high rates of restoration of knee stability and return to preinjury athletic activities. The rate of secondary treatment for recurrent ACL insufficiency over the course of long-term follow-up was greater than would be expected for primary ACL reconstruction. Greater side-to-side differences in objective findings of ligamentous laxity were identified at shorter term follow-up in the patients who later went on to experience symptomatic secondary ACL insufficiency, compared with those who maintained stability long term.

### Treatment of combined complete tears of the anterior cruciate and medial collateral ligaments [^6cf04554]. Arthroscopy (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To develop an evidence-based algorithm for the treatment of combined complete tears of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and medial collateral ligament (MCL).

Methods

We performed a systematic review using computerized keyword searches of Medline, Embase, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), ACP Journal Club, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Two reviewers independently performed searches and article reduction. Studies that reported stratified outcomes data after the treatment of combined complete tears of the ACL and MCL were included. Data on clinical measures of laxity, range of motion, and strength, as well as subjective outcome measures, were summarized.

Results

Five different treatment approaches were reported. Outcomes were better if the ACL was reconstructed and reconstruction was delayed to allow a return of knee range of motion. In many cases, this delay may allow the MCL to heal. MCL repair or reconstruction may be required if valgus instability remains after an appropriate rehabilitation period.

Conclusions

ACL reconstruction should be performed in a subacute time frame once full motion has returned. Valgus instability should be assessed at that time and MCL repair or reconstruction performed in those patients with persistent valgus instability.

Level Of Evidence

Level IV, systematic review of Level I to IV studies.

### Sport-specific differences in ACL injury, treatment and return to sports: football [^04068d41]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

FOOTBALL‐SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF NON‐SURGICAL TREATMENT OF ACL INJURIES

In general, and for all populations of athletes and non‐athletes, systematic reviews also show the possibility of non‐operative treatment of ACL ruptures, while information specifically for the football playing population show a trend to improved knee function and safe return to football after surgical repair. A recently published study by the national obligatory trauma insurance for professional sports in Germany showed that in over 200 ACL ruptures in professional sports, not a single ACL rupture was attempted to be treated non‐surgically. Restoring stability in the injured knee joint of a football player, which was caused by the ACL rupture or possible accompanying injuries, is the ultimate goal of treatment. Since such stability cannot be achieved without surgical stabilisation in the case of complete ruptures or high partial ruptures of the ACL, surgical reconstruction of stability is recommended in sports such as football with its high pivoting movements during play.

Considering that torn ACL fibres do not automatically return to the original attachment of the ACL, it must be assumed that the stability that has developed after a partial rupture of the ACL will not relevantly improve further over the rehab. Clinical testing of AP stability and rotational stability can therefore be used to decide early after trauma on whether a minimal partial rupture (e.g. less than 20% torn fibres) does not lead to any relevant instability and can therefore be treated without surgical reconstruction. Another important aspect to remark on is the extremely high burden of meniscal injuries concomitant to ACL rupture. This is due to the high compressive forces and axial load during single‐leg deceleration, coupled with rotations and translations typical of the football‐specific injury. A clinical study conducted on a specific population of professional footballers reported an 86% rate of concomitant meniscal injuries. Moreover, the rate of medial meniscal injuries (73%) and lateral root tears (33%) were significantly higher than in professional skiers, where no lateral root tears were reported at all. In footballers it is thus common to deal with specific combinations of ACL, root and ramp tears in a relevant number of cases, more than in other sports with different motor tasks and injury mechanisms such as ski. In such cases, conservative therapy not only involves avoiding concurrent injuries to the cartilage or meniscus, but also allowing a healing and rehabilitation period of 2‐3 months after trauma to prevent subsequent injuries.

### A randomized trial of treatment for acute anterior cruciate ligament tears [^3723d820]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). Excellent credibility.

Background

The optimal management of a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) of the knee is unknown.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, controlled trial involving 121 young, active adults with acute ACL injury in which we compared two strategies: structured rehabilitation plus early ACL reconstruction and structured rehabilitation with the option of later ACL reconstruction if needed. The primary outcome was the change from baseline to 2 years in the average score on four subscales of the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) — pain, symptoms, function in sports and recreation, and knee-related quality of life (KOOS(4); range of scores, 0 [worst] to 100 [best]). Secondary outcomes included results on all five KOOS subscales, the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, and the score on the Tegner Activity Scale.

Results

Of 62 subjects assigned to rehabilitation plus early ACL reconstruction, 1 did not undergo surgery. Of 59 assigned to rehabilitation plus optional delayed ACL reconstruction, 23 underwent delayed ACL reconstruction; the other 36 underwent rehabilitation alone. The absolute change in the mean KOOS(4) score from baseline to 2 years was 39.2 points for those assigned to rehabilitation plus early ACL reconstruction and 39.4 for those assigned to rehabilitation plus optional delayed reconstruction (absolute between-group difference, 0.2 points; 95% confidence interval, -6.5 to 6.8; P = 0.96 after adjustment for the baseline score). There were no significant differences between the two treatment groups with respect to secondary outcomes. Adverse events were common in both groups. The results were similar when the data were analyzed according to the treatment actually received.

Conclusions

In young, active adults with acute ACL tears, a strategy of rehabilitation plus early ACL reconstruction was not superior to a strategy of rehabilitation plus optional delayed ACL reconstruction. The latter strategy substantially reduced the frequency of surgical reconstructions.

### Anterior cruciate ligament tears: conservative or surgical treatment? A critical review of the literature [^421cf11c]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

Is it rational to recommend surgical reconstruction of the torn anterior cruciate ligament to every patient? Is conservative management still a valid option?

Method

Through a literature review, we looked for the arguments from each side and checked their validity.

Results

Unfortunately results of most studies cannot be compared because of the following reasons not exhaustively cited: studied populations differed with respect to age, sex, professional and sports activity level, lesions associated with ACL rupture, patient recruitment methods, time from injury to treatment and different therapeutic modalities. Furthermore, various methods were used to evaluate the clinical and radiological results and there was no consensus of their interpretation. Some authors assumed that the incidence of further meniscus lesions could probably be reduced if the torn ACL was surgically reconstructed. But, we have no evidence to believe that this would be due to the surgical repair rather than to a decrease of involvement in strenuous activities. At present it is not demonstrated that ACL-plasty can prevent osteoarthritis. Numerous factors could explain evolution to arthrosis whatever the treatment for the ACL-ruptured knee. Studies comparing surgical and conservative treatments confirm that ACL reconstruction is not the pre-requisite for returning to sporting activities. More recent and scientifically well-designed studies demonstrate that conservative treatment could give satisfactory results for many patients. They suggest some methods to help them choose the best treatment.

Conclusion

At present there are no evidence-based arguments to recommend a systematic surgical reconstruction to any patient who tore his ACL. Knee stability can be improved not only by surgery but also by neuromuscular rehabilitation. Whatever the treatment, fully normal knee kinematics are not restored. While the patients wish to go back to their sport and want everything possible done to prolong their ability to perform these activities, they should be informed that the risk of further knee lesions and osteoarthritis remains high, whatever the treatment, surgical or conservative.

### NCT04770233 | How to best treat anterior cruciate ligament injuries… [^1cfc5789]. ClinicalTrials (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Overview The project is a pragmatic registry-based RCT aiming to investigate ACL injury treatment. Study results will help fill knowledge gaps, facilitate shared decision making and strengthen patient treatment. Included patients will be randomized to early ACL surgery followed by rehabilitation or active rehabilitation with optional delayed surgery if indicated. Despite years of research on treating ACL injuries, it remains uncertain who should undergo reconstructive surgery and who should not. Our project aims to provide definitive answers to these important clinical questions affecting more than 4, 000 patients each year in Norway. We will provide this information by conducting a large comparative effectiveness trial of standard treatments for ACL deficiency. This RCT exploit the infrastructure of the Norwegian National Knee Ligament Registry, which uniquely include non-surgically treated ACL-tears and has almost complete coverage of surgical reconstructions.

Our multi-center register-RCT design considerably reduces costs and enables us to more rapidly include many more patients. Consequently, the design and study size will give the results excellent external validity. Surgery or not. It is estimated that 50% of patients with an ACL tear are treated surgically with a reconstruction. The majority of patients are young and active. The general consensus in Scandinavia is that patients who manage to regain acceptable knee function after active rehabilitation alone should not initially have surgery. The findings in a systematic review on this topic by authors in the project group high-light that the uncertain estimate of new meniscal tears after ACL injury should not guide clinical practice for all patients.

Even though joint stability often is achieved with surgery, the rate of return to pre-injury activity level after surgery is reported less than 50%, and no consistent results in reduction of the risk of later osteoarthritis have been shown. Admittedly, the risk of serious complications after ACL reconstruction is in general low, however still potentially devastating to the knee function. Recruitment problems has been highlighted as a challenge in a previous RCT on ACL treatment. The R-RCT mediates this by facilitating multi-center collaboration to ensure rapid inclusion of patients in the proposed trials. Hypotheses, aims and objectives The overall aim of this project is to assess the effect of surgical treatment and non-surgical treatment of patients with a complete tear of the anterior cruciate ligament as assessed with the KOOS which is the commonly accepted gold standard patient reported outcome measure for knee injuries.

Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) repair vs reconstruction — ACL tears indicated for surgery should be treated with ACL reconstruction rather than repair because of the lower risk of revision surgery. Quality of Evidence: High and Strength of Recommendation: Strong. ACL reconstruction is a common procedure and high quality studies suggest a lower rate of revision surgery compared to repair, and ACL reconstruction is currently the standard of care for primary ACL injury. Both ACL reconstruction and repair are resource-intensive when accounting for surgical costs as well as post-operative rehabilitation, and revision surgery, when necessary, also requires substantial resources. Future research should focus on lowering the rate of revision surgery for ACL repair, including innovations in patient selection based on tear location, biologic intervention and/or surgical technique.

### Diagnostic accuracy of dynamic ultrasound imaging in partial and complete anterior cruciate ligament tears: a retrospective study in 247 patients [^9076b268]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

MRI is an established imaging test for diagnosing anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears. According to the guidelines of American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, MRI serves as the non-invasive diagnostic test of first choice for identifying suspected intra-articular knee pathology while arthroscopic surgery is the current gold standard. The use of MRI in assessing intra-articular knee pathology has been reviewed excessively. For all ACL tears, a recent meta-analysis showed a sensitivity and specificity of 87% (95% CI 77% to 94%) and 93% (95% CI 91 to 96), respectively. However, MRI diagnosis of partial tears seems challenging with sensitivity ranging from 40% to 75%, and specificity from 62% to 89%. Unfortunately, MRI has several cons such as high costs, limited availability and the requirement to lie down still.

Dynamic high-resolution ultrasound (US) imaging of the knee shows promising results for accurately imaging of intra-articular pathology. A recently published meta-analysis evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of US in detecting complete ACL tears showed a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 97%. This means that for diagnosing complete ACL tears, US seems an effective test. Just like MRI, US also can detect accurately associated lesions, for example, meniscal pathology. Moreover, US has the potential to overcome many of the limitations of MRI: quickly executable, relatively inexpensive, easily accessible and offers the opportunity for dynamic examinations. Dynamic US enables pathology not detected in static examination, and visualises the effect of movement on function and stability of the affected knee structures. Furthermore, US has the advantage of being directly interpretable, enabling as a point-of-care test, which speeds up the diagnostic phase.

The authors of the meta-analysis evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of US in detecting ACL tears state that US is an effective test for diagnosing complete tears, but it may not be a suitable test for partial ACL tears, as 85% of them were missed on US (sensitivity of 15%). Besides selection and partial verification bias, they reported publication, language and retrieval bias. Another limitation of this study was the low number of partial ACL tears (n = 13). Therefore, more diagnostic accuracy studies are needed, especially focusing on partial ACL tears, as in most of the cases conservative treatment can be started. The objective of our study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of dynamic high-resolution US in the diagnosis of ACL tears, differentiating between partial and complete tears. Additionally, we evaluated the influence of patient characteristics on the diagnostic accuracy of US.

Therefore, the AAOS developed this CPG to aid practitioners in the management of patients with ACL injuries. Furthermore, the CPG represents a resource demonstrating areas that need additional investigation to provide improved evidence-based guidelines for the management of ACL injuries.

In summary, the ACL injuries guideline involved reviewing over 5,500 abstracts and more than 1,100 full-text articles to develop eight recommendations supported by 324 research articles meeting stringent inclusion criteria. Each recommendation is based on a systematic review of the research-related topic which resulted in five recommendations classified as high and three recommendations classified as moderate for both skeletally mature and immature patients who have been diagnosed with an ACL injury. The strength of recommendation also takes into account the quality, quantity, and the trade-offs between the benefits and harms of a treatment, the magnitude of a treatment's effect, and whether there are data on critical outcomes. Strength of recommendation is assigned based on the quality of the supporting evidence. In addition, seven options were formulated. Options are formed when there is little or no evidence on a topic. These included a consensus option on knee aspiration and limited strength options on ACL surgical reconstruction, meniscal repair, treatment for patients with a combined ACL/medial collateral ligament (MCL) tear, the use of prophylactic knee bracing treatment to prevent an ACL injury, return to sport after ACL reconstruction, and functional knee bracing treatment when returning to activity after ACL reconstruction.

### Editorial commentary: meniscal repair-why bother? [^d2510a14]. Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Whether to repair or resect meniscal tears remains a matter of controversy. In theory, partial meniscectomy increases contact pressure, which may result in progressive and early cartilage degeneration and early osteoarthritis. Meniscal preservation is the preferred treatment option, but only a small percentage of meniscal tears are suitable for repair. Two recent registry studies challenge this approach and suggest that partial meniscectomy has similar clinical outcomes in the short term. Whether these findings can be maintained in the long term remains to be seen.

### Management of traumatic meniscus tears: the 2019 ESSKA meniscus consensus [^afd74d1c]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

The types of meniscus tears that are suitable for repair must be identified to perform the repair and avoid unnecessary partial meniscus resections to decrease the risk of OA and allow patients return to full activity. In our opinion, the contrast of high rates of successful meniscus repairs and its superiority to partial meniscectomy regarding OA development and the return to the preoperative level of activity and the low number of performed repairs compared to meniscectomies indicates an apparent lack of understanding about the importance of meniscus repair.

Therefore, this European consensus may help in the decision-making process for the treatment of patients with traumatic meniscus tears by also considering factors such as a high BMI, age of the meniscus tears and patients and biological treatment options. Thus, this consensus will help the surgeon to improve his decision-making process and subsequently improve patient outcomes.

### Clinical outcomes and biomechanical analysis of posterolateral bundle augmentation in patients with partial anterior cruciate ligament tears [^446c9b38]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

To examine the clinical and biomechanical results of posterolateral (PL) augmentation to reconstruct damaged PL bundle while preserving the less-damaged anteromedial bundle for partial anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears in comparison with double-bundle ACL reconstruction.

Methods

Sixteen patients who underwent PL augmentation for partial ACL tears (Group P) and 37 patients who underwent double-bundle ACL reconstructions for complete ACL tears were examined (Group D). Anterior tibial translation (ATT) was evaluated using the KT-1000 arthrometer. ATT during the Lachman test and acceleration of posterior tibial translation (APT) during the pivot shift test were evaluated using an electromagnetic measurement system (EMS). Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the Lysholm score. Second-look arthroscopy was performed 1 year after surgery.

Results

The mean postoperative Lysholm scores were 91.7 ± 12.2 and 94.6 ± 7.2 in Groups P and D, respectively, and there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups. The mean side-to-side difference of ATT on the KT-1000 was significantly improved in both Groups P and D. In the EMS analysis, the mean side-to-side difference of ATT and the mean APT were significantly improved in both Groups P and D. There was no significant difference in the second-look evaluation between the two groups.

Conclusions

The clinical and biomechanical outcomes of PL augmentation were satisfactorily comparable to those of double-bundle ACL reconstruction. PL augmentation could be a useful treatment option for patients with partial ACL tears.

### 3-T MR imaging of partial ACL tears: a cadaver study [^2f73d384]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2007). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most commonly used diagnostic imaging procedure for suspected injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). However, MRI has less utility for the evaluation of partial ACL tears. The goal of this study was to evaluate the possibility of distinguishing partial ACL tears applying the double bundle concept by dividing the ACL anatomy in the anteromedial (AM) and posterolateral bundle (PL). Six human cadaver knees were used in this laboratory study. The protocol consisted of sagittal, oblique coronal, and oblique sagittal proton-density-weighted fast spin echo sequences. After MRI the AM and the PL bundle were severed to mimic different partial ACL rupture patterns. MRI scanning of each knee was repeated, to record the quantitative parameters tilt and ACL angles and discontinuity as a nonquantitative parameter. Three orthopaedic surgeons and two radiologists were enlisted as blinded observers to evaluate the images. The transection patterns could be differentiated by evaluating discontinuity both in the paracoronal and in the sagittal plane. Evaluating the transection patterns, the AM bundle reached a better result in both planes compared to the PL bundle and the paracoronal plane had a better result in assessing the transection patterns compared to the sagittal plane for the PL bundle. Partial ACL transections could predictably be recognized on oblique sagittal and oblique coronal planes utilizing 3-T MRI technology. This concept allows a more precise description of ACL rupture patterns and might lead to a more distinctive approach for reconstructive surgery. The presurgical planning could be improved by applying a treatment algorithm based on a description of each bundle as intact or ruptured, leading to a reconstruction of the torn and a preservation of the intact bundle.

### Incomplete bicruciate knee injuries: results of treatment with isolated anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction [^c8bc606f]. Arthroscopy (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine how the presence of a partial injury to the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) in conjunction with an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear affects the outcome of ACL reconstruction.

Type Of Study

Case series.

Methods

Between 1990 and 1998, 18 patients with surgically documented complete ACL ruptures and partial PCL tears, referred to as "incomplete bicruciate knee injuries", were treated with arthroscopic ACL reconstruction and PCL observation. Fifteen patients (83%) were available for follow-up evaluation at a mean of 60 months postoperatively. Follow-up evaluation consisted of physical examination, standard radiographs, isokinetic muscle testing, KT instrumented laxity testing, stress radiographs for posterior and total anterior-posterior translation, and Lysholm, Tegner, and IKDC outcome scores.

Results

At follow-up, 11 patients had a negative Lachman and 4 had a 1+ Lachman (3 to 5 mm translation). Instrumented arthrometer tests performed at follow-up showed less than 3 mm of increased anterior translation versus the opposite knee on manual maximum testing at 30 degree in 11 patients, and 3 to 5 mm translation in the remaining 4 patients, with an average of 1.3 mm increased translation. Symptomatic posterior instability was present in only 1 patient who had sustained a repeat injury resulting in a complete PCL tear postoperatively. Final IKDC outcome scores were normal or near normal in 13 patients (87%) and abnormal in 2 (13%). The average Lysholm score was 93 at follow-up, and only 1 patient had a score lower than 80.

Conclusions

Overall, the results of treatment of incomplete bicruciate knee injuries in this study compare favorably with the results of isolated ACL reconstruction reported in other series. We conclude that the clinical significance of an arthroscopically defined partial PCL tear in an ACL-deficient knee is minor, and that isolated ACL reconstruction in this setting appears to be effective treatment.

### Patient reported outcomes in patients undergoing arthroscopic partial meniscectomy for traumatic or degenerative meniscal tears: comparative prospective cohort study [^fbadcb6b]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Contrary to current opinion that individuals undergoing arthroscopic partial meniscectomy for traumatic meniscal tears have greater improvements in patient reported outcomes than those with degenerative meniscal tears, we found a significantly larger improvement in KOOS 4 scores — indicating better patient reported outcomes — for participants with degenerative tears. However, the difference was small and did not reach the prespecified level of a clinically meaningful difference at any time point up to one year, except for the KOOS pain subscale. A larger proportion of participants with traumatic tears were not satisfied with current knee function at 52 week follow-up, compared with participants with degenerative tears. About 15% of participants (53/342) were dissatisfied enough to consider that the treatment had failed, with no difference between groups.

Strength and weaknesses of the study

No randomised trials have compared the effects of arthroscopic partial meniscectomy with sham surgery or non-surgical treatment options such as exercise for traumatic meniscal tears. Knowledge on the natural time course of patient reported outcomes after arthroscopic partial meniscectomy is sparse in these patients. Most previous studies failed to account for symptom onset (that is, traumatic or non-traumatic), patient age, or concomitant injury to the anterior cruciate ligament. Early reports suggested better results in the absence of degenerative changes when undergoing arthroscopic partial meniscectomy. More recent studies have shown conflicting results, but these have been limited by poor study quality or small sample size. In the present study, participants were prospectively followed according to a prespecified protocolusing a validated patient reported outcome measure, enabling us to compare the natural time course of patient reported outcomes in participants with traumatic and degenerative meniscal tears.

### 2018 international olympic committee consensus statement on prevention, diagnosis and management of paediatric anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries [^2d0dc573]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Meniscal repair should be performed whenever possible in the paediatric patient because of the deleterious effects of meniscectomy and the positive outcomes of meniscal repair (i.e. the improved healing potential of the meniscus). This is especially important for bucket-handle, root and radial meniscal tears, and ramp lesions. If the surgeon does not have the skills or equipment to repair the meniscus tear, he or she should consider referring to a surgeon who has the expertise and equipment. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of ACL injuries and meniscus tears is needed to provide the best chance of preserving meniscal tissue.

Articular cartilage injuries in combination with ACL injury are less common than meniscal tears. However, the clinician should have a higher degree of suspicion of articular cartilage injury in patients with combined ACL and meniscal injuries. The medial femoral condyle may be particularly vulnerable. Factors that may be associated with more severe chondral lesions are recurrent instability episodes and increased time between ACL injury and reconstruction. It is unclear whether non-surgical management of ACL injuries is associated with a higher incidence of new chondral and meniscal lesions than ACL reconstruction.

Associated ligament injuries in children with ACL injuries

There is limited research on multiligament knee injuries and treatment in paediatric patients, and these injuries are less common in children than in adults. Therefore, consider referral to a specialist centre.

Specific surgical treatment considerations

Combined ACL and fibular collateral ligament injuries Use fluoroscopy prior to placing suture anchors for a repair, or for tunnel reaming for a concurrent ligament reconstruction, to evaluate tunnel position in relation to the physes.

Combined ACL and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injuries Non-surgical treatment may be appropriate for partial PCL tears or non-displaced avulsion injuries. PCL reconstruction is a relatively safe and viable treatment option in patients with multiligament injuries. Using a tibial inlay technique with a modified femoral tunnel location avoids transphyseal drilling. Although, there are no high-quality studies of this technique in children.

True knee dislocation Perform a reduction by manipulating the tibia relative to the femur. Avoid forceful hypertension or rotation, to minimise the risk for damage to cartilaginous and/or neurovascular structures. Following reduction, a dynamic knee brace can be applied (for at least 12 weeks) to prevent further intraarticular damage and to help hold the knee reduced while further treatment is planned. Ultimately, reconstruction of the ACL and PCL in combination with repair/reconstruction of additional ligaments (as needed) is the appropriate treatment.

### Management of ACL injuries: clinical practice guideline from the AAOS… [^f393173b]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Treatment. Physicians performing ACL reconstruction should use autograft or allograft tissue that is processed correctly. Studies have found that the clinical outcomes are similar between the two; however, how the allograft is prepared may cause some differences. Physicians should use bone-patellar tendon-bone or hamstring-tendon autografts, and should use a single- or double-bundle approach when performing intra-articular ACL reconstruction. Results of stability testing, patient satisfaction, knee function scores, and rates of failure have been shown to be similar between these two types of grafts, and there is no statistically significant difference in outcomes, including postoperative pain and knee function scores, between the single- and double-bundle approaches. Treatment.

Surgery can be appropriate in persons with an ACL tear who are 18 to 35 years of age and active, because it has been shown to decrease pathologic laxity, instances of instability, and additional injuries. Reconstructive surgery should be performed in the five months following injury; this is to protect the articular cartilage and menisci. Performing reconstruction within three to five months vs. after three to five months has been shown to improve stability, allow a higher level of activity and greater function, and reduce meniscus tears. Treatment. Limited evidence supports that rather than providing nonsurgical management, physicians may opt to perform reconstruction because it decreases pathologic knee laxity. If a patient has a meniscus tear in addition to an ACL injury, physicians may repair the meniscus when performing reconstruction.

Despite limited evidence, physicians may still perform ACL reconstruction in persons who are skeletally immature, because it appears to provide significant benefit vs. nonsurgical management with regard to stability, function, and activity. Evidence is limited to support nonsurgical treatment for persons who are less active and have less laxity, or performing reconstruction of an ACL tear combined with treating medial collateral ligament tears without surgery. Additionally, having to reach a particular functional milestone or waiting a certain amount of time after injury or surgery before returning to play or activity is not recommended. Treatment. Immediate treatment is recommended in persons with a torn ACL and a locked knee from a displaced meniscus tear, which can lead to fixed flexion contracture. Promptly unlocking the knee can help prevent this from occurring. If the meniscus is reduced earlier, then the tear may be more easily repaired.

### Healing results of meniscal tears left in situ during anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a review of clinical studies [^6f4b8c54]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2009). Low credibility.

The presence of peripheral meniscal tears is common at the time of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Techniques to preserve the maximum amount of meniscal tissue include "non operative" management (tear left alone, without repair or removal), meniscus repair, partial meniscectomy. There is a lack of consensus guidelines about the management of peripheral stable meniscal tears. When to remove, let alone or repair? We performed an evidence-based review of the outcomes of stable meniscal tears left in situ during ACL surgery, in order to assess the effectiveness of this popular procedure. Clinical and anatomical results (arthrography or second look arthroscopy) were analyzed. Our literature search yielded ten relevant studies (9 level IV, 1 level III). The mean time of follow-up was 16 months. Pain or mechanical symptoms related to the medial tibiofemoral joint were reported in 0–66% of cases. Subsequent medial meniscectomy or repair were performed in 0–33% of cases. Pain or mechanical symptoms related to the lateral tibiofemoral joint were reported in 0–18% cases. Subsequent lateral meniscectomy or repair were performed in 0–22% cases. A complete healing occurred in 50–61% cases for the medial meniscus and in 55–74% cases for the lateral meniscus. No definite conclusion can be made with regard to these results. The conservative approach is more effective for lateral menisci. The rate of bad results for the medial meniscus remains high when a conservative treatment is used. For the medial meniscus, repair of stable peripheral tears may be always indicated to decrease the risk of postoperative pain or subsequent meniscectomy.

Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) training programs — athletes in high-risk sports: Training programs designed to prevent injury can be used to reduce the risk of primary ACL injuries in athletes participating in high-risk sports. Quality of Evidence: Moderate and Strength of Recommendation: Moderate, defined as evidence from two or more "Moderate" quality studies with consistent findings, or evidence from a single "High" quality study for recommending for or against the intervention. Supporting data include a high quality study in adolescent, female Speak Takraw athletes in which a program incorporating strengthening, plyometric, and sports-specific agility exercises significantly reduced the rate of complete ACL tears 5.32 (1.11 to 15.58), with the rate of partial ACL tears not significantly different between groups; a moderate quality study in male NCAA soccer athletes demonstrating significant reductions in total injuries (p < 0.001), total knee injuries (p < 0.001), and ACL injuries (p = 0.21) in those performing the program; and a moderate quality study in adolescent, female Danish football (soccer) athletes showing a significant reduction in ACL injury rate ration (.36 95%CI 0.15 to 0.85, P = 0.02). Benefits and harms are summarized as three moderate quality studies and one high quality study demonstrating benefit with no high or moderate quality studies demonstrating harm.

The cost of implementing training programs designed to prevent primary ACL injury is not well studied, and effective exercise programs capable of reducing primary ACL injury should be accepted widely by the sports medicine community.

### Management of traumatic meniscus tears: the 2019 ESSKA meniscus consensus [^49514005]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Traumatic meniscus tears may occur in isolation but are commonly detected in conjunction with ligament injuries. The odds ratios of developing OA after isolated meniscus injuries or combined injuries of both the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and the meniscus are approximately 6.3 and 6.4, respectively. The main surgical treatment options are arthroscopic partial meniscectomy or meniscus repair. The latter led to less OA, a higher level of activity and higher patient satisfaction in the long term in some studies. Despite this evidence, a significant mismatch has been identified between the incidence of repairable meniscus tears and the repair rates in clinical practice. The incidence of traumatic meniscus tears in patients with a torn ACL ranged between 57 and 80%. Although more than 30% of meniscus tears are estimated to be suitable for repair, less than 10% are repaired. For instance, in France, 1,564,461 meniscectomies and 63,142 meniscus repairs were performed between 2005 and 2017, resulting in a repair rate of only 4%. Nevertheless, repair rates appear to increase over time. In the US, an analysis by the database of the American Board of Orthopedic Surgery revealed that the percentage of meniscus repairs has increased by 37% per surgeon from 2004 to 2012, whereas the rate of meniscectomies decreased by 17% per surgeon over the same period.

In addition to OA, the time to return to activity or failure rates may affect the treatment decision. After partial, subtotal or even total meniscectomy, patients generally return to their normal daily activities within 2–4 weeks. In contrast, patients require significantly more time for recovery after meniscus repair. However, meniscus repairs have a greater potential for helping patients return to the same level of activity. Another frequently mentioned drawback of meniscal repairs is their higher risk of failure and thus early revision arthroscopy in the short (16.5 vs. 1.4%) and long term (20.7 vs. 3.9%), both in adults and children or adolescents (repair: 18% vs. meniscectomy: 7%). Nevertheless, the clinical success rate of meniscus repairs substantially outweighs the failures, by 85%, as shown in a recent analysis of the literature.

### Management of rotator cuff injuries [^b9226455]. AAOS (2025). High credibility.

Surgical treatment vs. physical therapy for low- or intermediate-grade partial-thickness rotator cuff tears — In the absence of reliable evidence, it is the opinion of the workgroup that physical therapy can improve outcomes in patients with low-grade or intermediate-grade partial-thickness rotator cuff tears, and in patients with persistent pain and functional impairment after appropriate non-operative treatment, surgery can improve outcomes. Strength of Evidence: Consensus and Strength of Recommendation: Consensus, with the description noting that in the absence of reliable evidence the guideline workgroup is making a recommendation based on their clinical opinion. The rationale reports that no studies that compared PT versus surgery outright were identified, but in cohorts both surgery and PT had favorable outcomes. Nonsurgical treatment including physical therapy is suggested for partial-thickness tears due to low evidence of progression of tear severity, and treatment of partial-thickness tears should follow guidelines for subacromial pain.

### Acute patellar tendon ruptures: an update on management [^f0d59ab7]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Select investigations have quantified the rate at which partial patellar tendon tears require surgical intervention. In the Golman et alseries of 56 partial patellar tendon tears, 11 (20%) patients underwent surgery. Of them, nine underwent débridement alone, and two underwent suture anchor fixation. As all 11 surgical patients had a tear > 50% tendon thickness, the authors report that a tear greater than 55% of tendon thickness is predictive of need for surgical treatment. Karlsson et alreport on a separate series of partial ruptures that comprised 91 knees. Altogether, 27 (29.6%) knees were treated with surgery involving débridement and curettage where necessary. In this series, partial ruptures were graded according to length of tear as measured on ultrasonography: Grade 1 < 10 mm, grade II 10 to 20 mm, grade III > 20 mm. Overall need for surgery was highest in grade III (38.5%) and lowest in grade I (6.6%). The authors conclude that failure of conservative management can be predicted to some degree by measuring tear length. Outcomes of partial patellar tendon repair are limited; however, in the Karlsson series, short-term results were excellent or good in 25 (92.5%) of surgical patients. The ideal timing of surgery in cases of partial tears remains unknown.

Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) treatment considerations emphasize that most treatments carry known risks, especially invasive and operative, and contraindications vary by treatment; concerns include infection, DVT, and anesthesia complications, and other complications of ACL surgery include recurrent instability with graft re-tear and contralateral ACL tear, postoperative loss of motion or arthrofibrosis, neurovascular injury, and kneeling pain, while patient comorbidities, skeletal maturity, associated injuries, and characteristics such as obesity, activities, and work demands may affect treatment choice.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: management of osteoarthritis of the knee (nonarthroplasty), third edition [^03dcbc23]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

AAOS osteoarthritis of the knee — partial meniscectomy recommendation: Arthroscopic partial meniscectomy can be used for the treatment of meniscal tears in patients with concomitant mild to moderate osteoarthritis who have failed physical therapy or other nonsurgical treatments, with a Strength of Recommendation: Moderate. The guideline adds that this procedure should be considered in patients with mild-to-moderate knee OA and an MRI confirmed meniscal tear who have previously failed appropriate conservative treatment such as physical therapy, corticosteroid injections, and a course of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, and it defines the Moderate rating as evidence from two or more "Moderate" quality studies with consistent findings, or evidence from a single "High" quality study for recommending for or against the intervention, with no or only minor concerns addressed in the EtD framework.

### Long-term failure of thermal shrinkage for laxity of the anterior cruciate ligament [^d841f615]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Appropriate treatment for anterior cruciate ligament laxity, owing to partial tears of the native ligament or lax reconstruction, is unclear. Studies suggest that a significant percentage of these untreated tears may progress to complete tears or the patient may develop additional injuries to the meniscus or articular cartilage. Shrinkage of the ligament or graft using thermal energy has been proposed as a solution for this problem.

Purpose

To evaluate the long-term results using thermal energy to shrink laxity of the anterior cruciate ligament.

Study Design

Case series; Level of evidence, 4.

Methods

Nineteen patients with partial tears of the anterior cruciate ligament (n = 14) or stretched anterior cruciate ligament grafts (n = 5) underwent thermal shrinkage treatment. Fourteen were available for follow-up at 1 and 5 years. At 1 year, there were 12 partial tears and 2 grafts available for evaluation. At 5 years, there were 10 partial tears and 4 grafts. Preoperative, postoperative, and intraoperative stability testing was performed using the KT-1000 arthrometer. Clinical results were evaluated using the Cincinnati and Lysholm scoring systems.

Results

Intraoperative shrinkage averaged 2.12 mm (17%, P < .0001). At 1 year, 12 of the 14 patients remained stable (86%) with a negative Lachman test result and mean KT-1000 arthrometer maximum side-to-side score of 1.29 mm (P < .001). The 2 failed shrinkages were partial tears of the native anterior cruciate ligament. For these 12 patients, Cincinnati scores improved from 53 to 89 (P < .0001), and Lysholm scores improved from 55 to 89 (P < .0003). At 5-year follow-up, 11 of 13 patients had gone on to complete failure (85%, P < .002; 8/9 partial tears and 3/4 grafts).

Conclusion

Thermal shrinkage provides short-term benefit in the treatment of anterior cruciate ligament laxity but leads to catastrophic failure in the majority of patients at long-term follow-up. We can no longer recommend this procedure for the treatment of anterior cruciate ligament laxity.

### Low accuracy of diagnostic codes to identify anterior cruciate ligament tear in orthopaedic database research [^d47c464a]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Database research is being used in orthopaedic literature with increased regularity. The main limitation of database research is the absence of diagnosis and treatment verification afforded by medical chart review. This absence may limit the accuracy of some conclusions and recommendations produced by database research. Hypothesis/Purpose: The purpose was to describe the accuracy of 1 database (Rochester Epidemiology Project) used in orthopaedic research to detect isolated anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears and to discuss the limitations of database research. It was hypothesized that diagnostic codes alone are unlikely to be accurate in identifying patients with ACL tears.

Study Design

Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 2.

Methods

A population-based historical cohort study was performed with the Rochester Epidemiology Project database. All subjects had International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, diagnosis codes consistent with ACL tears between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 2010. The medical records of all subjects were reviewed in detail to confirm the accuracy of diagnosis and gather data on injury type, laterality, associated meniscal injuries, magnetic resonance imaging findings, and treatment details.

Results

A total of 3494 patients had codes consistent with ACL tears, and 2288 of them were confirmed through chart review to have an isolated ACL tear (65.5%). Among these were 1841 patients (52.7%) with an ACL tear within 1 year of injury and an additional 447 (12.8%) with an ACL tear > 1 year from injury. Thirty-nine patients (1.1%) had a partial ACL tear diagnosed on magnetic resonance imaging, 48 (1.4%) had an isolated posterior cruciate ligament tear, and 22 (0.6%) had a combined ACL-posterior cruciate ligament injury. Twenty-four patients (0.7%) had ACL reconstruction before the study period. The remaining 1073 patients (30.7%) had diagnostic codes consistent with an ACL tear but did not have a cruciate ligament injury.

Conclusion

This study demonstrates low accuracy with the use of diagnostic codes alone to identify an ACL tear. Database studies offer unique benefits to the medical literature, but the inherent limitations should be taken into account when these data are used to counsel patients, dictate clinical management, or make health care policy decisions. Information from a health care database is most accurate when accompanied by verification of diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes with medical chart review.

### Delaying ACL reconstruction and treating with exercise therapy alone may alter prognostic factors for 5-year outcome: an exploratory analysis of the KANON trial [^77899594]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Treatment strategy

Single-bundle autograft ACL reconstructions were performed using the patellar tendon (40 procedures) or hamstring tendon (51 procedures) in line with the preference of four senior surgeons who performed all procedures. All early ACL reconstructions were performed 46 weeks following randomisation. Timing of delayed ACL reconstructions ranged from 2 to 56 months after randomisation. Meniscal tears were treated by partial resection (and in a few cases partial fixation) when indicated by MRI and/or clinical findings, either at the time of ACL reconstruction or separately. Other surgical interventions were done as clinically indicated. Participants from all groups performed the same goal oriented, physiotherapist supervised neuromuscular exercise therapy programme at nine outpatient clinics.

Five-year outcomes

The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) is valid for use in ACL-ruptured individuals and has a high test–retest reliability in patients with knee injury. The KOOS comprises five subscales, scored from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). The subscale addressing function in activities of daily living (ADL) is the least applicable to young, active individuals 5 years following ACL rupture, where near to normal scores are commonly reported irrespective of impairments in the other four subscales. Therefore, we excluded the ADL subscale, but included the other four KOOS subscales (pain, symptoms, sport and recreation function (sport/rec), QOL) as outcomes.

Prognostic factors

Injury-related factors

Baseline cartilage and meniscus damage, osteochondral lesions and knee extension deficit were identified as injury-related factors with potential to impact 5-year outcome.

Baseline 1.5 T MRI examinations were used to grade concomitant baseline injuries using the Anterior Cruciate Ligament OsteoArthritis Score (ACLOAS)by a musculoskeletal radiologist with 11 years experience in standardised semi-quantitative MRI assessment of knee pathology and experience with using the ACLOAS (FWR). The ACLOAS is a whole joint scoring system devised for use in acutely ACL-injured knees covering acute osteochondral and other damage as well as pre-existing pathology commonly considered to be part of the osteoarthritis spectrum. All features were dichotomised into presence and absence for the purpose of this study (as described below), where the highest grade on each scale was taken for each participant. A full description of the ACLOAS scoring criteria has been published.

### Management after acute injury of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Part 3: recommendation on surgical treatment [^d147b6d6]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this consensus project was to give recommendations regarding surgical treatment of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injured patient.

Methods

For this consensus process, an expert, steering and rating group was formed. In an initial online meeting, the steering group, together with the expert group, formed various key topic complexes for which multiple questions were formulated. For each key topic, a structured literature search was performed by the steering group. The results of the literature review were sent to the rating group with the option to give anonymous comments until a final consensus voting was performed. Sufficient consensus was defined as 80% agreement.

Results

During this consensus process, 30 topics regarding the surgical management and technique of ACL reconstruction were identified. The literature search for each key question resulted in 30 final statements. Of these 30 final statements, all achieved consensus.

Conclusions

This consensus process has shown that surgical treatment of ACL injury is a complex process. Various surgical factors influence patient outcomes. The proposed treatment algorithm can be used as a decision aid for the surgeon.

### Treatment for acute anterior cruciate ligament tear in young active adults [^d086a710]. NEJM Evidence (2023). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury of the knee is common in young active adults and often has severe and sometimes lifelong consequences. The clinical management of this injury remains debated. A prior trial of early versus delayed optional ACL repair showed no differences in outcomes at 2 years. METHODS: We present the 11-year follow-up of a randomized clinical trial involving 121 young active adults (mean age 26yo, 74% male) with an acute sports-related ACL tear. We compared patient-reported and radiographic outcomes between those randomized to receive early ACL reconstruction (ACLR) followed by exercise therapy (N = 62) and those treated with early exercise therapy plus optional delayed ACLR (N = 59). The primary end point at 11 years was change from baseline in the mean of four subscales of the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) — pain, symptoms, function in sports and recreation, and knee-related quality of life (KOOS4; range of scores, 0 [worst] to 100 [best]; minimal important change = 9). RESULTS: In all, 88% of the cohort followed up at 11 years (53/62 in the early vs. 54/59 in the optional late ACL repair groups), and 52% of those assigned to optional delayed ACLR underwent ACLR. Mean improvement in KOOS4 from baseline to 11 years was 46 points for those assigned to early ACLR plus exercise therapy and 45 points for those assigned to exercise therapy plus optional delayed ACLR (between-group difference, 1.6 points; 95% confidence interval [CI] −8.8 to 5.6; P = 0.67 after adjustment for baseline score, full analysis set). About two thirds of the full cohort reported meeting the case definition for a "patient-acceptable symptom state" (KOOS4 patient-acceptable symptom state threshold value = 79), whereas 44% had developed radiographic osteoarthritis of their injured knee. Mean summed incident radiographic osteoarthritis feature scores, scores range from 0 to 30 where higher scores indicate more severe joint damage, were 2.4 for the group assigned to early ACLR and 1.0 for the group assigned to exercise therapy plus optional delayed ACLR (mean difference, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.1 to 1.9). CONCLUSIONS: At 11-year follow-up, among young active adults with acute ACL tears assigned to early ACLR plus exercise versus initial exercise therapy with the option of delayed ACLR, there were no differences in patient-reported outcomes.

### Diagnostic accuracy of dynamic ultrasound imaging in partial and complete anterior cruciate ligament tears: a retrospective study in 247 patients [^33d13d5c]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Considering the availability, and relatively fast learning curve, US seems an ideal diagnostic screening test for ACL tears. Given the excellent NPV for complete ACL tears, we believe a negative US outcome justifies to refrain from MRI and arthroscopic surgery. However, positive US for ACL tears should be interpreted with caution. Yet, in daily practice, also age and clinical presentation are taken into account deciding whether or not to perform arthroscopic surgery. Our study and clinical experience show that even partial tears, especially subtotal tears, may also require ACL reconstruction. The dynamic nature of the US imaging enables us to distinguish between partial and subtotal tears: the empty notch sign is only seen in subtotal and complete tears, while instability of the posteromedial tibia is clearer in subtotal tears. This finding is of influence in the decision for treatment (either conservative or operative) especially in the sport active younger patients. Furthermore, one should also look at other knee pathology depicted at US, such as meniscal tears, medial collateral ligament tears and Segond fractures. Considering the mechanical pathway occurring while tearing these structures, one could also expect the ACL to be affected. Moreover, the advantage of point-of-care US is that it can be utilised at the time of the patient's clinical evaluation, so no additional appointments have to be scheduled. This speeds up the diagnostic phase.

Since our study had a retrospective design, future studies should use a prospective design with a period of patient follow-up. This follow-up period enables the clinical course of patients who had an initial negative US for ACL tears, as most of these patients will initially not be operated on. We used a combination of one direct and three indirect signs to assess the integrity of the ACL. Other indirect signs have been described, for example, capsular protrusion and posterior cruciate ligament wave sign, and anterior tibial translation. Future studies should also include an analysis of several combinations of signs, enabling the most accurate combination. Adding physical examination signs, for example, anterior tibial translation, is likely to improve accuracy. This latter best reflects clinical practice as diagnosis relies on a combination of all signs. We qualitatively assessed the tibial translation, where a quantitative approach seems more valid. However, with the current US software, this is not possible.

### Management of anterior cruciate ligament injuries [^66095fd5]. AAOS (2022). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for anterior cruciate ligament injury, more specifically with respect to ACL reconstruction (timing), AAOS 2022 guidelines recommend to prefer early reconstruction when surgical treatment is indicated for an acute isolated ACL tear because the risk of additional cartilage and meniscal injury starts to increase within 3 months.

### How to best treat anterior cruciate ligament injuries… [^3a97bb2d]. ClinicalTrials (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Overview The project is a pragmatic registry-based RCT aiming to investigate ACL injury treatment. Study results will help fill knowledge gaps, facilitate shared decision making and strengthen patient treatment. Included patients will be randomized to early ACL surgery followed by rehabilitation or active rehabilitation with optional delayed surgery if indicated. Despite years of research on treating ACL injuries, it remains uncertain who should undergo reconstructive surgery and who should not. Our project aims to provide definitive answers to these important clinical questions affecting more than 4, 000 patients each year in Norway. We will provide this information by conducting a large comparative effectiveness trial of standard treatments for ACL deficiency. This RCT exploit the infrastructure of the Norwegian National Knee Ligament Registry, which uniquely include non-surgically treated ACL-tears and has almost complete coverage of surgical reconstructions.

Our multi-center register-RCT design considerably reduces costs and enables us to more rapidly include many more patients. Consequently, the design and study size will give the results excellent external validity. Surgery or not. It is estimated that 50% of patients with an ACL tear are treated surgically with a reconstruction. The majority of patients are young and active. The general consensus in Scandinavia is that patients who manage to regain acceptable knee function after active rehabilitation alone should not initially have surgery. The findings in a systematic review on this topic by authors in the project group high-light that the uncertain estimate of new meniscal tears after ACL injury should not guide clinical practice for all patients.

Even though joint stability often is achieved with surgery, the rate of return to pre-injury activity level after surgery is reported less than 50%, and no consistent results in reduction of the risk of later osteoarthritis have been shown. Admittedly, the risk of serious complications after ACL reconstruction is in general low, however still potentially devastating to the knee function. Recruitment problems has been highlighted as a challenge in a previous RCT on ACL treatment. The R-RCT mediates this by facilitating multi-center collaboration to ensure rapid inclusion of patients in the proposed trials. Hypotheses, aims and objectives The overall aim of this project is to assess the effect of surgical treatment and non-surgical treatment of patients with a complete tear of the anterior cruciate ligament as assessed with the KOOS which is the commonly accepted gold standard patient reported outcome measure for knee injuries.

### Arthroscopic partial meniscectomy versus physical therapy for traumatic meniscal tears in a young study population: a randomised controlled trial [^5f12f717]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Although this is the first RCT in this context, our results suggest that there is a reasonable alternative to early arthroscopic partial meniscectomy as first-line treatment in patients with a traumatic meniscal tear. The challenge is predicting which patients will benefit from arthroscopic partial meniscectomy and who will improve with non-surgical treatment. Further studies should investigate whether we can already predict at an early stage who will need surgery and who will have good prognosis with physical therapy. In our study, 41% of the patients randomised to physical therapy still underwent an arthroscopic partial meniscectomy during follow-up. In studies investigating degenerative tears, 20%–30% of the patients who started with physical therapy crossed-over to arthroscopic partial meniscectomy. Changing the treatment paradigm for traumatic meniscal tears to a more conservative treatment may also have major impact on treatment costs and result in large healthcare savings.

American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries guideline — introduction and scope states that the clinical practice guideline is based on a systematic review of published studies on the treatment of ACL injuries in skeletally mature and immature patients, and is intended for appropriately trained surgeons and qualified physicians; it also serves as an information resource for decision makers and developers of practice guidelines and recommendations. The goals are to help improve treatment based on the current best evidence, with AAOS staff and the physician work group systematically reviewing the available literature and writing recommendations based on a rigorous, standardized process; the systematic review was conducted between June 06, 2020, and September 11, 2021 (initial literature search on August 5th, 2020 and final literature search on August 27th, 2021). The document is an educational tool and should not be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding methods reasonably directed to obtaining the same results, and ultimate judgment must be made in light of patient circumstances and local resources. The guideline emphasizes informing the patient and/or the patient's guardian of available therapies and their relative risks and benefits to support informed decision-making, and identifies intended users as orthopaedic surgeons and physicians managing patients with ACL injuries.

### Isolated tears of the anterior cruciate ligament: over 30-year follow-up of patients treated with arthrotomy and primary repair [^bde6a266]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Over 30 years ago, Feagin and Curl reported on the diagnosis and treatment of "isolated" injuries of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term results of the patients initially diagnosed with tears of the ACL, with special emphasis on those treated with primary repair.

Hypothesis

Long-term results are unsatisfactory for open evaluation and treatment of ACL injuries with or without primary repair.

Study Design

Case series; Level of evidence, 4.

Methods

Follow-up was available on 34 of the original 57 patients (60%) who had ACL tears on evaluation by arthrotomy. The average age at the index procedure was 20 years, and average follow-up was 32 (range, 29–36) years. Twenty-five of the 26 complete ACL tears were treated with primary repair. None of the 8 partial tears was repaired. Evaluations included the subjective and symptom ratings of the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) evaluation form, Lysholm score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Tegner activity scale, and SANE rating.

Results

For the IKDC subjective score, 18 of 34 patients rated their knees as normal or nearly normal. The Lysholm scores averaged 70.1 (range, 20–100). The average SANE rating at 5 years was 74.8 (range, 49–110), and the current SANE rating averaged 68.9 (range, 10–100). The overall KOOS rating averaged 68.6 (range, 26.4–100). The Tegner activity score was 3.7. There was little difference between patients with unrepaired partial tears and those who had primary repairs.

Conclusion

At more than 30-year follow-up, patients have decreased activity levels and an equal mix of acceptable and unacceptable outcomes. We were unable to identify any predictive factors that correlated with the results; however, subsequent meniscal surgery did correlate with poor results. The results at greater than 30 years reinforce the 5-year results that showed unsatisfactory results after the open evaluation and treatment of ACL injuries with or without repair.

### The contribution of partial meniscectomy to preoperative laxity and laxity after anatomic single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: in vivo kinematics with navigation [^9b0a3e62]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Limited in vivo kinematic information exists on the effect of clinical-based partial medial and lateral meniscectomy in the context of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction.

Hypothesis

In patients with ACL deficiency, partial medial meniscus removal increases the anteroposterior (AP) laxity with compared with those with intact menisci, while partial lateral meniscus removal increases dynamic laxity. In addition, greater postoperative laxity would be identified in patients with partial medial meniscectomy.

Study Design

Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.

Methods

A total of 164 patients with ACL tears were included in the present study and divided into 4 groups according to the meniscus treatment they underwent: patients with partial lateral meniscectomy (LM group), patients with partial medial meniscectomy (MM group), patients with partial medial and lateral meniscectomy (MLM group), and patients with intact menisci who did not undergo any meniscus treatment (IM group). A further division in 2 new homogeneous groups was made based on the surgical technique: 46 had an isolated single-bundle anatomic ACL reconstruction (ACL group), while 13 underwent a combined single-bundle anatomic ACL reconstruction and partial medial meniscectomy (MM-ACL group). Standard clinical laxities (AP translation at 30° of knee flexion, AP translation at 90° of knee flexion) and pivot-shift (PS) tests were quantified before and after surgery by means of a surgical navigation system dedicated to kinematic assessment. The PS test was quantified through 3 different parameters: the anterior displacement of the lateral tibial compartment (lateral AP); the posterior acceleration of the lateral AP during tibial reduction (posterior acceleration); and finally, the area included by the lateral AP translation with respect to the flexion/extension angle (area).

Results

In the ACL-deficient status, the MM group showed a significantly greater tibial translation compared with the IM group (P < .0001 for AP displacement at 30° [AP30] and 90° [AP90] of flexion) and the LM group (P = 0.002 for AP30 and P < .0001 for AP90). In the PS test, the area of LM group was significantly larger (57%; P = 0.0175) than the one of the IM group. After ACL reconstruction, AP translation at 30° was restored, while the AP90 remained significantly greater at 1.3 mm (P = 0.0262) in the MM-ACL group compared with those with intact menisci.

Conclusion

Before ACL reconstruction, partial medial meniscectomy increased AP laxity at 30° and 90° and lateral meniscectomy increased dynamic PS laxity with respect to intact menisci. Anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction decreased laxities, but a residual anterior translation of 1.3 mm at 90° remained in patients with partial medial meniscectomy, with respect to those with intact menisci.

### Current concepts of the management of anterior cruciate ligament injuries in children [^91c850f4]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Recent reports have suggested an increase in the number of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in children, although their true incidence is unknown. The prognosis of the ACL-deficient knee in young active individuals is poor because of secondary meniscal tears, persistent instability and early-onset osteoarthritis. The aim of surgical reconstruction is to provide stability while avoiding physeal injury. Techniques of reconstruction include transphyseal, extraphyseal or partial physeal sparing procedures. In this paper we review the management of ACL tears in skeletally immature patients.

Rehabilitation should be progressed according to both time‐ and criterion‐based milestones. A minimum of 4 months of rehabilitation may be recommended for repaired vertical tears of the meniscus, whereas complex, complete radial/root and horizontal tears may require a longer duration of rehabilitation (i.e. 6–9 months) (Grade D).

2 How does the location of meniscus tear/repair (i.e. stable, unstable, root tear, complex tear and white zone tear) influence the progression of rehabilitation after repair (i.e. ROM, WB and loading activities)?

For vertical longitudinal tears, FWB may be recommended, with a limitation of ROM for 6 weeks. For ramp lesions, the rehabilitation protocol is driven by associated procedures (e.g. ACL reconstruction) (Grade C).

Limitation of WB and ROM for 4–6 weeks is recommended for complex, horizontal, radial and root repairs (Grade C).

Following repair‐specific early post‐operative restrictions in ROM and WB, rehabilitation after meniscus repair should follow criterion‐ and time‐based components. Return to activities requires meeting progressive milestones throughout rehabilitation (e.g. effusion, ROM, quadriceps strength, neuromuscular control) and meeting healing time frames. This is different from arthroscopic partial meniscectomy, which is criteria‐based (Grade D).

Agreement: Mean 7.2 ± 1.96, Median 8 (5–9), Relative agreement.

3 Are there specific exercises that should be avoided following all meniscus repair (e.g. deep loaded flexion — deep squats)? If so, then for how long?

### Treatment after anterior cruciate ligament injury: panther symposium ACL treatment consensus group [^55359a61]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatment strategies for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries continue to evolve. Evidence supporting best practice guidelines for the management of ACL injury is to a large extent based on studies with low-level evidence. An international consensus group of experts was convened to collaboratively advance toward consensus opinions regarding the best available evidence on operative vs. non-operative treatment for ACL injury. The purpose of this study is to report the consensus statements on operative vs. non-operative treatment of ACL injuries developed at the ACL Consensus Meeting Panther Symposium 2019. Sixty-six international experts on the management of ACL injuries, representing 18 countries, were convened and participated in a process based on the Delphi method of achieving consensus. Proposed consensus statements were drafted by the Scientific Organizing Committee and Session Chairs for the three working groups. Panel participants reviewed preliminary statements prior to the meeting and provided the initial agreement and comments on the statement via an online survey. During the meeting, discussion and debate occurred for each statement, after which a final vote was then held. Eighty percent agreement was defined a-priori as consensus. A total of 11 of 13 statements on operative v. non-operative treatment of ACL injury reached the consensus during the Symposium. Nine statements achieved unanimous support, two reached strong consensus, one did not achieve consensus, and one was removed due to redundancy in the information provided. In highly active patients engaged in jumping, cutting, and pivoting sports, early anatomic ACL reconstruction is recommended due to the high risk of secondary meniscus and cartilage injuries with delayed surgery, although a period of progressive rehabilitation to resolve impairments and improve neuromuscular function is recommended. For patients who seek to return to straight plane activities, non-operative treatment with structured, progressive rehabilitation is an acceptable treatment option. However, with persistent functional instability, or when episodes of giving way occur, anatomic ACL reconstruction is indicated. The consensus statements derived from international leaders in the field will assist clinicians in deciding between operative and non-operative treatments with patients after an ACL injury.

### Surgical versus conservative interventions for treating anterior cruciate ligament injuries [^b0f1ed54]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is a common injury, mainly affecting young, physically active individuals. The injury is characterised by joint instability, leading to decreased activity, which can lead to poor knee-related quality of life. It is also associated with increased risk of secondary osteoarthritis of the knee. It is unclear whether stabilising the knee surgically via ACL reconstruction produces a better overall outcome than non-surgical (conservative) treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effects of surgical versus conservative interventions for treating ACL injuries.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (18 January 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2016, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1946 to January Week 1 2016), MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations (18 January 2016), EMBASE (1974 to 15 January 2016), trial registers (February 2016) and reference lists.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials that compared the use of surgical and conservative interventions in participants with an ACL rupture. We included any trial that evaluated surgery for ACL reconstruction using any method of reconstruction, type of reconstruction technique, graft fixation or type of graft.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently screened all titles and abstracts for potentially eligible studies, for which we then obtained full-text reports. Two authors then independently confirmed eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We used the GRADE approach to assess the overall quality of the evidence.

Main Results

We identified one study in which 141 young, active adults with acute ACL injury were randomised to either ACL reconstruction followed by structured rehabilitation (results reported for 62 participants) or conservative treatment comprising structured rehabilitation alone (results reported for 59 participants). Built into the study design was a formal option for subsequent (delayed) ACL reconstruction in the conservative treatment group, if the participant requested surgery and met pre-specified criteria. This study was deemed at low risk of selection and reporting biases, at high risk of performance and detection biases because of the lack of blinding and at unclear risk of attrition bias because of an imbalance in the post-randomisation exclusions. According to GRADE methodology, the overall quality of the evidence was low across different outcomes. This study identified no difference in subjective knee score (measured using the average score on four of the five sub-scales of the KOOS score (range from 0 (extreme symptoms) to 100 (no symptoms)) between ACL reconstruction and conservative treatment at two years (difference in KOOS-4 change from baseline scores: MD -0.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) -6.78 to 6.38; N = 121 participants; low-quality evidence), or at five years (difference in KOOS-4 final scores: MD -2.0, 95% CI -8.27 to 4.27; N = 120 participants; low-quality evidence). The total number of participants incurring one or more complications in each group was not reported; serious events reported in the surgery group were predominantly surgery-related, while those in conservative treatment group were predominantly knee instability. There were also incomplete data for total participants with treatment failure, including subsequent surgery. In the surgical group at two years, there was low-quality evidence of far fewer ACL-related treatment failures, when defined as either graft rupture or subsequent ACL reconstruction. This result is dominated by the uptake by 39% (23/59) of the participants in the conservative treatment group of ACL reconstruction for knee instability at two years and by 51% (30/59) of the participants at five years. There was low-quality evidence of little difference between the two groups in participants who had undergone meniscal surgery at anytime up to five years. There was low-quality evidence of no clinically important between-group differences in SF-36 physical component scores at two years. There was low-quality evidence of a higher return to the same or greater level of sport activity at two years in the ACL reconstruction group, but the wide 95% CI also included the potential for a higher return in the conservative treatment group. Based on an illustrative return to sport activities of 382 per 1000 conservatively treated patients, this amounts to an extra 84 returns per 1000 ACL-reconstruction patients (95% CI 84 fewer to 348 more). There was very low-quality evidence of a higher incidence of radiographically-detected osteoarthritis in the surgery group (19/58 (35%) versus 10/55 (18%)).

Authors' Conclusions

For adults with acute ACL injuries, we found low-quality evidence that there was no difference between surgical management (ACL reconstruction followed by structured rehabilitation) and conservative treatment (structured rehabilitation only) in patient-reported outcomes of knee function at two and five years after injury. However, these findings need to be viewed in the context that many participants with an ACL rupture remained symptomatic following rehabilitation and later opted for ACL reconstruction surgery. Further research, including the two identified ongoing trials, will help to address the limitations in the current evidence, which is from one small trial in a young, active, adult population.

### Treatment after anterior cruciate ligament injury: panther symposium ACL treatment consensus group [^199f7010]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are one of the most common injuries of the knee, with an incidence of approximately 85 per 100 000 in patients aged between 16 and 39 years. The ACL is the primary stabilizer of the knee limiting anterior tibial translation and internal rotation, with deficiency resulting in anterior and rotatory instability. The commonest mode of injury is a non-contact mechanism during pivoting, cutting, and jumping with the knee slightly flexed and in a valgus position.

Both operative and non-operative treatments of an ACL injury continue to evolve. Improved understanding of the structure and function of the native ACL has supported the development and adoption of anatomic ACL reconstruction techniques. In parallel, increased recognition of the resilience of the neuromuscular system in achieving dynamic, functional knee stability despite ACL deficiency has concurrently supported non-operative treatment as a viable strategy in some patients.

Successful outcomes following both operative and non-operative treatment necessitate progressive rehabilitation, which entails staged and phase-adjusted physical therapy with the aim to address impairments, achieve functional stability, and to safely return to sport. The acute phase after the injury or surgery focuses on the elimination of residual symptoms (effusion, pain) and impairments (range of motion, quadriceps activation, and strength). Subsequently, neuromuscular and perturbation training are implemented to improve knee stabilization. The last phase aims to further optimize muscular strength, return to pre-injury sports level through sport-specific exercises, and assess psychological readiness for the return to sport. Any discussion of non-operative treatment within this consensus document implies the completion of a progressive, staged rehabilitation protocol.

Similarly, any discussion of operative treatment implies anatomic ACL reconstruction (Table 1), which intends to restore the ACL to its native dimensions, collagen orientation, and insertion sites. Anatomic ACL reconstruction includes both single- and double-bundle techniques, followed by a progressive rehabilitation program that considers the natural healing cascade and ligamentization of the graft. Following fixation during ACL reconstruction, biological graft transitions from a tendon to a structure with ultrastructural, biochemical, and mechanical properties more similar to the native ACL. These properties of the graft depend on the phase of ligamentization, with the minimum graft strength occurring between 4 and 12 weeks postoperatively. Comprehensive rehabilitation after operative ACL reconstruction is also paramount for clinical outcome and return to sports.

### Good results after treatment of RAMP lesions in association with ACL reconstruction: a systematic review [^5216247e]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Eligibility criteria

The literature selected for this study was based on the following criteria.

Study design

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled (non-randomized) clinical trials (CCTs), prospective and retrospective comparative cohort studies, case–control studies, and case series were included. Case reports and case series that did not report data on clinical and functional results were excluded.

Participants

Studies conducted on skeletally mature patients treated for RAMP lesion of the medial meniscus in association with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. and were evaluated through a minimum follow-up of 1 year were considered eligible.

Interventions

Studies that reported data on clinical, functional, and radiological outcomes following the ACL reconstruction associated with RAMP lesion of the medial meniscus, independently if treated surgically or conservatively.

For ACL reconstruction the surgical technique (type of graft used, numbers of bundles, fixation technique, and tensioning protocol), and rehabilitation protocol were collected as well as approach and surgical technique for meniscal RAMP repair.

Types of outcome measures

The outcome measures extracted from the studies were the Short Form-12 (SF-12) in its mental and physical component (MCS and PCS), Lysholm score, Subjective IKDC, Marx Score, WOMAC Score, Tegner, radiological changes, complications, failures and/or revision surgery, and rate of return to sports.

RAMP lesions were classified according to the current literature as follows:
Thaunat et al. approached the tear pattern, direction, thickness (partial vs. full), and associated meniscocapsular disruption, peripheral zone, or meniscotibial ligament lesion and instability (Type 1: meniscocapsular tear; Type 2: partial superior tear; Type 3: partial inferior tear; Type 4: complete tear; Type 5: double tear)
Greif et al. in an extended Thaunat classification version integrate the recent knowledge from cadaveric studies showing that meniscocapsular and meniscotibial ligaments merge in their posterior horn meniscal attachment (Type 1: meniscocapsular ligament tear; Type 2: partial superior peripheral posterior meniscal horn tear; Type 3A: partial inferior peripheral posterior horn meniscal tear; Type 3B: meniscotibial ligament tear; Type 4A: complete peripheral posterior horn meniscal tear; Type 4B: complete meniscocapsular junction tear; Type 5: peripheral posterior horn meniscal double tear)
Seil et al. approached the mediolateral extent of tears, degree of capsular attachment injury, and adherent (self-heal) vs. dehiscent (repair).

### Arthroscopic partial meniscectomy versus physical therapy for traumatic meniscal tears in a young study population: a randomised controlled trial [^63437663]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Arthroscopic partial meniscectomy is the most frequently performed orthopaedic surgery in the world. Around 500 000 partial meniscectomies are performed annually in the USA, of which 40% in patients under 45 years. In middle age and older patients with chronic degenerative tears, multiple high level studies showed that partial meniscectomy has no benefit compared with non-operative treatment. These studies led to new clinical practice guidelines making a strong recommendation against arthroscopic treatment and recommending initial non-operative treatment for older patients with degenerative tears.

Young patients with acute meniscal tears in previously healthy knees are usually offered surgery. There is a widespread belief that surgery is needed to diminish complaints such as locking and joint line pain but no high level trials have investigated arthroscopic partial meniscectomy compared with non-operative treatment. We conducted the first (to our knowledge) randomised controlled trial (RCT) in a young population (18 to 45 years) with traumatic meniscal tears in otherwise healthy knees, comparing the effectiveness of arthroscopic partial meniscectomy with physical therapy. The aim of our study was to investigate whether arthroscopic partial meniscectomy was superior to physical therapy in young patients with traumatic meniscal tears for IKDC score at 24-month follow-up.

### Arthroscopic partial meniscectomy versus physical therapy for traumatic meniscal tears in a young study population: a randomised controlled trial [^ea48f34b]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first study to our knowledge comparing arthroscopic partial meniscectomy with physical therapy for traumatic meniscal tears in young patients with stable non-osteoarthritic knees. We did not find that arthroscopic partial meniscectomy was superior to physical therapy plus optional delayed arthroscopic partial meniscectomy at 24-month follow-up. Both groups showed clinically relevant improvements during the 24-month follow-up but did not achieve maximum IKDC scores at final follow-up. Fifty-nine per cent of the patients in the physical therapy group did not receive a delayed arthroscopic partial meniscectomy.

Arthroscopic surgery for meniscal injuries has become the most widely performed orthopaedic surgery in the world. This growth was based on a number of assumptions about the ability of surgery to achieve superior outcomes compared with non-surgical treatments. Over time, these have been questioned based on high-quality clinical studies. These high-quality studies examined the effectiveness in older patients with degenerative meniscal tears. This has led to a change in clinical practice guidelines. In the current guidelines, a strong recommendation is made against surgery and non-surgical treatment is recommended. Until recently, there were no clinical guidelines for traumatic meniscal injury. In 2019, the European Society for Sports Traumatology, Knee Surgery and Arthroscopy (ESSKA) published a consensus on the treatment of traumatic meniscal tears, stating that meniscus preservation should be the first choice of treatment. This consensus was based on low-quality evidence due to a lack of randomised studies. Clinical trials focusing on patients with traumatic meniscal tears are sparse, and RCTs comparing arthroscopic partial meniscectomy to non-operative treatment for this specific patient group were lacking. We studied a young homogeneous population with stable non-osteoarthritic knees and a clear isolated recent traumatic meniscal tear.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline summary: management of anterior cruciate ligament injuries [^fe132bcd]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) surgical reconstruction — clinical option strength and considerations are as follows: ACL reconstruction can be considered in order to lower the risk of future meniscus pathology or procedures, particularly in younger and/or more active patients, and ACL reconstruction may be considered to improve long term pain and function. Quality of Evidence: Low and Strength of Option: Limited. Group consensus suggests that age and activity levels are important considerations when deciding between treatment options, and while the available literature does not typically consider the impact of concomitant meniscus or chondral injuries when comparing outcomes of surgical versus non-surgical treatment of ACL tears, the workgroup suggests that concomitant injuries should be factored into treatment decisions. Benefits and harms note that ACL reconstruction is a common procedure and that while reconstruction offers a number of benefits, evidence regarding long-term differences in outcomes between operative and non-operative treatment is lacking. Cost considerations state that in the short-term, ACL reconstruction is more costly than non-operative treatment and that long-term cost-effectiveness comparisons are lacking.

### Treatment after anterior cruciate ligament injury: panther symposium ACL treatment consensus group [^30f2ebf4]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion: Operative and non-operative are both acceptable treatment options after ACL injury, and a decision based on concomitant injuries, risk factors, level of activity, and patient's expectations and goals is recommended as demonstrated in the following statements.

Operative versus non-operative treatment should be reached via a shared decision-making process that considers the patient's presentation, goals, and expectations as well as a balanced presentation of the available evidence-based literature.

Agree 19/23, 82.6%

Before a particular treatment approach is pursued, the provider (physician and/or physical therapist) should present the evidence for operative and non-operative treatment options for an ACL injury to the patient. Based on the patient's activity level, goals, and expectations, a decision should be made with the patient (and parents/guardians for minors) and provider as the primary stakeholders. Physicians and physical therapists must be aware that personal and situational factors, such as level of competition, time in season, playing status, and role in the team, could affect the injured athlete's treatment decision. Parents and coaches are often the first individuals from whom athletes seek support or advice. However, the coach may be conflicted by the interests of the team and the athlete's immediate and future health. For some athletes, reactions and comments of parents related to the athlete's injury were reported to negatively affect the athlete's treatment decision, with pressure to return to sport. Due to the possible conflict of interest, secondary stakeholders such as family, coaches, and agents, among others, should not be directly involved in the decision-making process, although their indirect involvement may be considered.

Conclusion: Shared decision-making of the treatment option should be based on the evidence for operative and non-operative treatments, patient's expectations and goals with the provider, and patient as the primary stakeholders.

The (injury) status of other stabilizing and supporting structures (e.g. meniscus, other ligaments, cartilage) affects the decision to pursue operative or non-operative treatment.

Agree 23/23, 100%

ACL injuries often occur together with concomitant injury to other knee structures, with meniscal injuries reported in 23–42%, cartilage lesions in 27%, and combined meniscal and chondral lesions in 15% of cases (Fig. 1).

### Clinical outcomes after anterior cruciate ligament injury: panther symposium ACL injury clinical outcomes consensus group [^a2b901fe]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

A stringent outcome assessment is a key aspect for establishing evidence-based clinical guidelines for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury treatment. The aim of this consensus statement was to establish what data should be reported when conducting an ACL outcome study, what specific outcome measurements should be used and at what follow-up time those outcomes should be assessed.

Methods

To establish a standardized approach to assessment of clinical outcome after ACL treatment, a consensus meeting including a multidisciplinary group of ACL experts was held at the ACL Consensus Meeting Panther Symposium, Pittsburgh, PA; USA, in June 2019. The group reached consensus on nine statements by using a modified Delphi method.

Results

In general, outcomes after ACL treatment can be divided into four robust categories — early adverse events, patient-reported outcomes, ACL graft failure/recurrent ligament disruption and clinical measures of knee function and structure. A comprehensive assessment following ACL treatment should aim to provide a complete overview of the treatment result, optimally including the various aspects of outcome categories. For most research questions, a minimum follow-up of 2 years with an optimal follow-up rate of 80% is necessary to achieve a comprehensive assessment. This should include clinical examination, any sustained re-injuries, validated knee-specific PROs and Health-Related Quality of Life questionnaires. In the mid- to long-term follow-up, the presence of osteoarthritis should be evaluated.

Conclusion

This consensus paper provides practical guidelines for how the aforementioned entities of outcomes should be reported and suggests the preferred tools for a reliable and valid assessment of outcome after ACL treatment.

### Surgical versus conservative interventions for anterior cruciate ligament ruptures in adults [^2172fea9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Anterior cruciate ligament rupture is a common knee injury. Surgical treatment, usually involving reconstruction of the ligament, is widely used especially in active individuals.

Objectives

Evaluation of the effect of surgical treatment compared with conservative treatment of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Injuries Group Specialised Register (January 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to January Week 3 2005), EMBASE (1988 to 2005 Week 05), MEDIC (1978 to January 1999), Current Contents (9.2.1998 to 1.2.1999), BIOSIS (1970 to December 1998), reference lists of articles and consulted trialists and experts.

Selection Criteria

All randomised and quasi-randomised trials that compared surgical with conservative treatment of ACL rupture in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently performed study selection, data extraction and quality assessment.

Main Results

Two poor quality randomised trials conducted in the early 1980s were included in the review. The two trials differed considerably and no data pooling was done for the few shared outcome measures. One quasi-randomised trial of 167 people with a complete ACL rupture treated with repair or augmented repair versus conservative treatment found no difference in the return to sports activities between people treated surgically and those treated conservatively. Measures of knee stability and functional (Lysholm) knee scores were higher in surgically-treated participants. By the end of the follow-up period (average 55 months), three people treated with repair only and 16 treated conservatively had had ACL reconstruction. The other trial included 157 people with ACL injury. This found that conservatively-treated participants recovered from their injury more rapidly but, at the last follow up (minimum 13 months), the functional outcome was similar in both treatment groups. A large proportion of participants experienced some temporary discomfort after surgery and there were some more serious postoperative complications. There was less knee instability in surgically-treated participants and a tendency to fewer subsequent operations in the longer term.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence from randomised trials to determine whether surgery or conservative management was best for ACL injury in the 1980s, and no evidence to inform current practice. Good quality randomised trials are required to remedy this situation.

### Treatment after anterior cruciate ligament injury: panther symposium ACL treatment consensus group [^6a9d2699]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The expert panel at the ACL Consensus Meeting Panther Symposium 2019 reached consensus, defined as > 80% agreement, on 11 of 12 statements in terms of operative vs. non-operative treatments for ACL injuries. Consensus was reached that both treatment options may be acceptable, depending on patient characteristics, including the type of sporting demands and the presence of concomitant injuries. In highly active patients engaged in jumping, cutting, and pivoting sports, the early anatomic ACL reconstruction is recommended due to the high risk of secondary meniscus and cartilage injuries with delayed surgery, although a period of progressive rehabilitation to resolve impairments and improve neuromuscular function may be recommended. For patients who want to return to straight plane activities, non-operative treatment with structured, progressive rehabilitation is an acceptable treatment option. However, with persistent functional instability, or episodes of giving way occur, anatomic ACL reconstruction is indicated.

Despite strong consensus by experts, there is a need for larger randomized trials with longer term follow-up in which the early surgery (followed by rehabilitation) is compared with a strategy of early rehabilitation and delayed surgery. There are insufficient data to guide treatment in instances when there are concomitant meniscal and collateral ligament injuries. Data on long-term clinical outcomes are needed to better understand the effect of ACL treatment of injuries, subsequent injuries to meniscus and cartilage, and the development of osteoarthritis.

### Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with lateral plasty restores anterior-posterior laxity in the case of concurrent partial medial meniscectomy [^0f037cd9]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the in vivo knee laxity in the presence of a partial medial meniscectomy before and after a single-bundle ACL reconstruction with a lateral plasty (SBLP) and to compare it with the knee laxity after a single-bundle ACL reconstruction (SB).

Methods

One-hundred and one patients with ACL tear were enrolled in the study and grouped according to the surgical technique and the meniscus treatment: regarding the SBLP technique (n = 55), 31 patients underwent isolated ACL reconstruction ("SBLP Isolated ACL Group"), while 24 patients underwent combined ACL reconstruction and partial medial meniscectomy ("SBLP ACL+MM Group"); regarding the SB technique (n = 46), 33 patients underwent isolated ACL reconstruction ("SB Isolated ACL Group"), while 13 patients underwent combined ACL reconstruction and partial medial meniscectomy ("SB ACL+MM Group"). Anterior-posterior clinical laxity at 30° (AP30) and 90° (AP90) of knee flexion was quantified before and after surgery through a surgical navigation system dedicated to kinematic assessment.

Results

In the ACL-deficient status, the antero-posterior laxity was significantly higher in the presence of a combined MM in both the AP30 and the AP90, with no differences between the two surgical techniques. After the ACL reconstruction, both AP30 and AP90 translations decreased significantly (p < 0.0001) compared to the ACL-deficient status. No differences were found for AP30 and AP90 between SBLP Isolated ACL and SBLP+MM groups, while a significantly higher AP90 translation was found for the SB+MM group compared to the SB Isolated ACL group. Moreover, the AP90 translation in the SB ACL+MM group was significantly higher than the one of the other three groups, i.e. SBLP ACL+MM, SB, and SBLP Isolated ACL group.

Conclusion

The ACL reconstruction with lateral plasty reduced the AP knee laxity caused by the medial meniscectomy in the context of an ACL surgery.

### Management after acute injury of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), part 2: management of the ACL-injured patient [^7cf110e8]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this consensus project was to create a treatment algorithm for the management of the ACL-injured patient which can serve as an aid in a shared decision-making process.

Methods

For this consensus process, a steering and a rating group were formed. In an initial face-to-face meeting, the steering group, together with the expert group, formed various key topic complexes for which various questions were formulated. For each key topic, a structured literature search was performed by the steering group. The results of the literature review were sent to the rating group with the option to give anonymous comments until a final consensus voting was performed. Sufficient consensus was defined as 80% agreement.

Results

During this consensus process, 15 key questions were identified. The literature search for each key question resulted in 24 final statements. Of these 24 final statements, all achieved consensus.

Conclusions

This consensus process has shown that ACL rupture is a complex injury, and the outcome depends to a large extent on the frequently concomitant injuries (meniscus and/or cartilage damage). These additional injuries as well as various patient-specific factors should play a role in the treatment decision. The present treatment algorithm represents a decision aid within the framework of a shared decision-making process for the ACL-injured patient.

### Validity of GNRB® arthrometer compared to telos ™ in the assessment of partial anterior cruciate ligament tears [^b26eade1]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

The main goal of this study was to compare the results of the GNRB(®) arthrometer to those of Telos™ in the diagnosis of partial thickness tears of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).

Methods

A prospective study performed January-December 2011 included all patients presenting with a partial or full-thickness ACL tears without ACL reconstruction and with a healthy contralateral knee. Anterior laxity was measured in all patients by the Telos™ and GNRB(®) devices. This series included 139 patients, mean age 30.7 ± 9.3 years. Arthroscopic reconstruction was performed in 109 patients, 97 for complete tears and 12 single bundle reconstructions for partial thickness tears. Conservative treatment was proposed in 30 patients with a partial thickness tear. The correlation between the two devices was evaluated by the Spearman coefficient. The optimal laxity thresholds were determined with ROC curves, and the diagnostic value of the tests was assessed by the area under the curve (AUC).

Results

The differential laxities of full and partial thickness tears were significantly different with the two tests. The correlation between the results of laxity measurement with the two devices was fair, with the strongest correlation between Telos™ 250 N and GNRB(®) 250 N (r = 0.46, p = 0.00001). Evaluation of the AUC showed that the informative value of all tests was fair with the best results with the GNRB(®) 250 N: AUC = 0.89 [95% CI 0.83–0.94]. The optimal differential laxity threshold with the GNRB(®) 250 N was 2.5 mm (Se = 84%, Sp = 81%).

Conclusion

The diagnostic value of GNRB(®) was better than Telos™ for ACL partial thickness tears.

### Treatment after anterior cruciate ligament injury: panther symposium ACL treatment consensus group [^d43b3678]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion: In active patients, anatomic ACL reconstruction is the preferred treatment due to the higher rate of return to pre-injury sports level.

In active patients wishing to return to jumping, cutting and pivoting sports (e.g. soccer, football, handball, basketball):

Return to cutting and pivoting sports without surgery places the knee at risk of secondary injury (meniscus, cartilage, etc.).

Agree 23/23, 100%

In a prospective randomized-controlled trial, patients with high activity levels (median Tegner activity score of 9) with isolated ACL tears received the early operative treatment or non-operative treatment with the option of delayed ACL reconstruction. Although no differences were evident for patient-reported outcomes, at 2-year follow-up, patients in the "optional" operative treatment group had more self-reported and clinical laxity of the involved knee and more meniscal surgery over a 5-year follow-up period. In a separate cohort, the risk for sustaining at least one additional intra-articular injury increased by 0.6% with each month of delay in operative treatment. The odds of secondary cartilage lesions increased by nearly 1% for each month of delay. A delay in ACL reconstruction of at least 12 months almost doubled the risk for meniscal tears. Increased risk of secondary injury is especially noted in young (< 12 years) and skeletally immature patients.

### Primary surgery versus primary rehabilitation for treating anterior cruciate ligament injuries: a living systematic review and meta-analysis [^82f60f2a]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is one of the most common and serious knee injuries, with an annual incidence of 0.03% in the general population and 0.15–3.67% in professional athletes. ACL injuries are associated with marked individualand socioeconomic burden; optimising recovery is pertinent. The patient and/or clinician stand point determines the outcome of interest. This may be prevention of joint osteoarthritis and secondary meniscal damage, return to sport rate and time to return, athletic performance, improvement of quality of life and cost-effectiveness as all have their relevance and this spectrum needs to be considered in clinical practice and research.

There has been debate on whether management should be primarily surgical (ie, surgical reconstruction soon after injury) versus primarily rehabilitative (with the option of later reconstruction in the case of persistent instability). To date, this debate has not been informed by high-quality systematic review. Accordingly, the quality of evidence in the underlying randomised controlled trials (RCTs) available to previous reviews of the topiccould not document a superiority of one approach versus another. Furthermore, new RCT data will come to light over time to add to the evidence base for specific outcomes and subgroups. Living systematic reviewsare a relevant methodological approach for when one can expect the evidence based for a spectrum of outcomes to mature over time.

The aim of this living systematic review is to examine the comparative effectiveness of primarily surgical versus primarily rehabilitative treatment strategy after ACL rupture. To comprehensively capture the multidimensional facets of this question, we consider patient-reported outcome measures and other outcome measures in different individual, social and economic dimensions.

### Secondary meniscal tears in patients with anterior cruciate ligament injury: relationship among operative management, osteoarthritis, and arthroplasty at 18-year mean follow-up [^bcbc531e]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is one of the most frequent orthopaedic injuries and reasons for time loss in sports and carries significant implications, including posttraumatic osteoarthritis (OA). Instability associated with ACL injury has been linked to the development of secondary meniscal tears (defined as tears that develop after the initial ACL injury). To date, no study has examined secondary meniscal tears after ACL injury and their effect on OA and arthroplasty risk.

Purpose

To describe the rates and natural history of secondary meniscal tears after ACL injury and to determine the effect of meniscal tear treatment on the development of OA and conversion to total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

Study Design

Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.

Methods

A geographic database of > 500,000 patients was reviewed to identify patients with primary ACL injuries between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 2005. Information was collected with regard to ACL injury treatment, rates/characteristics of the secondary meniscal tears, and outcomes, including development of OA and conversion to TKA. Kaplan-Meier and adjusted multivariate survival analyses were performed to test for the effect of meniscal treatment on survivorship free of OA and TKA.

Results

Of 1398 primary ACL injuries, the overall rate of secondary meniscal tears was 16%. Significantly lower rates of secondary meniscal tears were noted among patients undergoing acute ACL reconstruction within 6 months (7%) as compared with patients with delayed ACL reconstruction (33%, P < .01) and nonoperative ACL management (19%, P < .01). Of the 235 secondary meniscal tears identified (196 patients), 11.5% underwent repair, 73% partial meniscectomy, and 16% were treated nonoperatively. Tears were most often medial in location (77%) and complex in morphology (56% of medial tears, 54% of lateral tears). At the time of final follow-up, no patient undergoing repair of a secondary meniscal tear (0%) underwent TKA, as opposed to 10.9% undergoing meniscectomy and 6.1% receiving nonoperative treatment (P = 0.28).

Conclusion

Secondary meniscal tears after ACL injury are most common among patients undergoing delayed surgical or nonoperative treatment of their primary ACL injuries. Secondary tears often present as complex tears of the medial meniscus and result in high rates of partial meniscectomy.

### Effect of physical therapy vs arthroscopic partial meniscectomy in people with degenerative meniscal tears: five-year follow-up of the ESCAPE randomized clinical trial [^10f3ba59]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and their aggregated data in systematic reviews show that arthroscopic partial meniscectomy has no clinically meaningful patient benefit compared with exercise therapy in patients with a degenerative meniscal tear in the first 2 years of follow-up. These findings have been embedded in the most recently updated guidelines.

Long-term trial results (ie, 3- to 5-year follow-up) of arthroscopic partial meniscectomy vs exercise therapy for patients with degenerative meniscal tears have been published. These studies have consistently reported a lack of clinically relevant differences between partial meniscectomy and exercise therapy on important patient-reported outcomes, such as knee function. While these results are consistent, debate still exists on the progression of osteoarthritis (OA) after arthroscopic partial meniscectomy. The long-term trial results have reported conflicting data with respect to this outcome. The RCT conducted by Sihvonen et alfound that arthroscopic partial meniscectomy is associated with a slightly increased risk of radiographic knee OA compared with exercise therapy. The study by Katz et alfound a 5 times higher risk for total knee replacement (ie, the treatment for end-stage knee OA) after surgery vs exercise-based physical therapy. However, the trials by Berg et al, Herrlin et al, and Sonesson et althat compared surgery with exercise therapy found no clinically relevant difference between the 2 treatments for OA progression.

Although the current evidence suggests nonoperative management is best in patients with degenerative meniscal tears, it has not yet led to a substantial reduction of meniscal surgeries for this population. Additional evidence from RCTs on the long-term outcomes (ie, ≥ 3 years) of patients with degenerative meniscal tears is likely to further clarify the role of surgery and exercise in the management of meniscal tears.

The primary aim of this study was to compare patient-reported knee function at the 5-year follow-up after arthroscopic partial meniscectomy and exercise-based physical therapy in patients with a degenerative meniscal tear. The secondary aim was to assess the progression of radiographic and symptomatic evidence of knee OA. We hypothesized that exercise-based physical therapy is noninferior to arthroscopic partial meniscectomy over a period of 5 years.

### Anterior cruciate ligament injury in skeletally immature patients [^970b69f1]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). Medium credibility.

The incidence of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury continues to increase in the skeletally immature population. These injuries were historically treated with nonsurgical measures in this age group due to concerns for iatrogenic damage to the physis during ACL reconstruction. However, delayed surgery often led to recurrent instability, meniscal tears, and chondral damage. With the development of newer and safer surgical techniques with satisfactory outcomes, ACL reconstruction has become much more common in this age group. The patient's skeletal age is often used to determine remaining growth, which helps to decide the surgical technique chosen. These techniques include physeal sparing, partial transphyseal, and transphyseal surgical options, using soft-tissue autografts. Each technique has been shown to have favorable patient-reported outcomes, but no technique is without the risk of complications. This article will review the management of skeletally immature ACL injuries, including relevant anatomy, risk factors for injury, assessment of skeletal age, and different treatment options and outcomes.

Measurement properties for clinical examination and MRI

'No isolated question, test or image can accurately identify an ACL injury, every time'.
No isolated question, test or image can accurately identify an ACL injury, every time. The measurement tools available to the clinician are not perfect, but they do yield valuable information in the clinical context. Knowledge of the measurement properties of clinical tools helps the clinician balance the information gained from these tools. The negative predictive values of clinical examination and MRI for ACL tear and meniscal pathology are higher than the positive predictive values (table 1). This means that if the clinical examination and MRI are negative for injury, the chance of the patient having an injury is low. However, if the tests are positive, it does not mean that the clinician can always reliably rule the diagnosis in.

Section 3: treatment of ACL injuries in children

This section addresses the fundamental clinical question: what are the treatment options for the child with ACL injury? Once the clinician is certain of the injury diagnosis, he or she first needs to know the available treatment options, and discuss these options with the child and the child's parents/guardian, so a shared decision can be made about how best to manage the knee injury.

The goals of treatment for the child with ACL injury are:
To restore a stable, well-functioning knee that enables a healthy, active lifestyle across the lifespan.
To reduce the impact of existing or the risk of further meniscal or chondral pathology, degenerative joint changes and the need for future surgical intervention.
To minimise the risk of growth arrest and femur and tibia deformity.

There are two treatment options that can help the child with ACL injury (with or without associated knee injuries) achieve these goals: high-quality rehabilitation alone (non-surgical treatment) and ACL reconstruction plus high-quality rehabilitation. In this section, the key components of high-quality rehabilitation for the child with ACL injury, and the options for ACL reconstruction surgical technique are described. Potential treatment decision modifiers are outlined in Section 4.

### Editorial commentary: is "Patch and run" the new way to address partial rotator cuff tears? [^bb7ccf0d]. Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Partial rotator cuff tears are managed non-operatively as a first-line treatment modality. When operative intervention is indicated, the appropriate technique has yet to be clearly elucidated. Operative management includes in-situ repair, tear completion with repair, and more recently, bioinductive collagen patch implantation. Although bioinductive collagen implants have a shorter recovery time with a less stringent rehabilitation protocol with significant improvements on magnetic resonance imaging, comparison of functional outcomes following isolated biologic patch augmentation to repair techniques is limited and demonstrates no difference.

### Knee rotational laxity and proprioceptive function 2 years after partial ACL reconstruction [^93a3ddc3]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of our study was to evaluate knee rotational laxity and proprioceptive function 2 years after partial anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. According to our hypothesis, partial ACL reconstruction could restore knee laxity and function to the intact level.

Methods

We conducted a study in fifteen consecutive patients undergoing partial ACL reconstruction. Fifteen anteromedial bundle tears were identified intraoperatively. Partial ACL reconstructions were performed by the same senior surgeon using a single-incision technique. A bone-patellar tendon-bone graft was used in 13 cases and a double-stranded semitendinosus graft in 2 cases of chronic patellar tendonitis. The mean age at surgery was 29 years. The time between ACL tear and surgery averaged 7.8 months (range 2.5–29.5 months). We developed an original device designed to assess knee proprioception (passive and active) and measure weight-bearing rotational laxity in full extension and at 30°, 60° and 90° of knee flexion. All measurements were taken on both the reconstructed and healthy knee.

Results

The mean follow-up of the study was 3.4 years (range 2.6–4.4). No statistically significant difference in rotational laxity, active or passive proprioception could be observed between the reconstructed and healthy knee. External rotation was significantly greater than internal rotation in full extension and at 30° of flexion in the reconstructed and the healthy knee (P < 0.05). For each knee, active proprioception was found to be significantly different (higher) than passive proprioception (P < 0.05).

Conclusion

Our study did not detect any difference in rotational laxity and proprioception between the reconstructed and the healthy knee. Therefore, partial ACL reconstruction appears to restore satisfactory knee laxity and function in case of partial ACL tear.
