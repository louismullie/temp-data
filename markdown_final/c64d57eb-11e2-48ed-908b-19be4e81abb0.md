## Question

Which medication works best for tinnitus?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medication works best for tinnitus and whether any pharmacotherapy should be used routinely for persistent, bothersome tinnitus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about current guideline positions on drug therapy. Then, I should review high-quality comparative evidence, including network meta-analyses and recent randomized trials. Next, I will consider the magnitude of placebo effects that can confound interpretation. After that, I should weigh combination-drug data. Finally, I will integrate nonpharmacologic first-line options and synthesize a pragmatic, guideline-concordant approach.

> Let me first confirm the guideline stance so I don't overstate any medication claims; both the AAO-HNSF clinical practice guideline and the VA/DoD guideline recommend against routinely using pharmacotherapy such as antidepressants, anticonvulsants, anxiolytics, intratympanic drugs, or dietary supplements for persistent, bothersome tinnitus, while emphasizing nonpharmacologic management as first-line care [^1134HBVb] [^115o6qoK] [^1115PBPQ].

> Hold on, let me carefully examine the drug-class evidence before drawing conclusions; although network meta-analyses signal that brain-acting agents like amitriptyline, acamprosate, or gabapentin and anti-inflammatory/antioxidant strategies (e.g., intratympanic dexamethasone plus oral melatonin) can outperform placebo on tinnitus severity metrics, none improved quality of life, and guidelines still advise against routine pharmacotherapy, so any apparent signal must be interpreted cautiously and in context of heterogeneity and potential bias [^1178WiR2] [^114kH7Aq] [^1134HBVb].

> Wait, I should double-check supplement data and negative recommendations; Ginkgo biloba has repeatedly failed to demonstrate meaningful benefit, and guidelines recommend not using dietary supplements such as Ginkgo, melatonin, or zinc for symptom relief in persistent tinnitus despite scattered positive signals in some analyses, reinforcing that these are not standard of care [^116P6YJg] [^1115PBPQ].

> I need to account for the placebo effect magnitude because it can easily masquerade as drug benefit; pooled placebo arms in RCTs show clinically notable reductions in THI and related scales, and a strong placebo effect has been specifically highlighted in the Ginkgo literature, which means between-group superiority is the critical lens for interpreting any pharmacologic trial in tinnitus [^111yGZYy] [^117Jb6Gj].

> Let me now examine recent combination-drug RCT data to see if more targeted pairings overcome placebo; an 8-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial found that nortriptyline-topiramate and verapamil-paroxetine each improved TFI within groups, but neither regimen beat placebo between groups, underscoring why guideline bodies have remained conservative about recommending medications [^116t4JgH].

> Next, I should review nonpharmacologic options that consistently carry stronger evidence and guideline support; CBT is recommended by AAO-HNSF and VA/DoD and is the only intervention shown to improve tinnitus-related quality of life in systematic reviews, with hearing aids advised for those with concomitant hearing loss and sound therapy often integrated within multidisciplinary care pathways [^115A1fZS] [^113SxDbp] [^115o6qoK] [^117GJ4oG] [^1114arv1].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I mentioned "2025" earlier — let me correct that to ensure accuracy; the VA/DoD guideline being cited here is the 2024 version, which recommends considering a referral for CBT by a trained provider for bothersome tinnitus and suggests offering hearing aids when hearing loss is present, aligning with the nonpharmacologic, multidisciplinary emphasis [^116cgkg5] [^115o6qoK].

> Synthesizing this, I should be explicit and conservative: there is no medication that is clearly established as "best" or routinely recommended for tinnitus, and while amitriptyline ranks highly on tinnitus severity in a network meta-analysis, the lack of quality-of-life benefit, significant placebo effects, and consistent guideline recommendations against routine pharmacotherapy mean drugs, if used at all, should be adjunctive, individualized, and framed as off-label with uncertain benefit relative to nonpharmacologic first-line treatments [^1178WiR2] [^1134HBVb].

> Finally, in pragmatic terms, I need to ensure shared decision-making if pharmacotherapy is contemplated; treat comorbid depression, anxiety, or insomnia on their own merits rather than as tinnitus treatments, set expectations about limited and heterogeneous efficacy, monitor validated outcomes like THI/TFI for objective change, and prioritize CBT, education, and hearing rehabilitation as the backbone of care given their stronger evidence and endorsement by major guidelines [^111YM7Fr] [^115A1fZS] [^115o6qoK].

No medication is recommended as **first-line therapy for tinnitus** [^1134HBVb] because no drug reliably reduces tinnitus loudness or distress [^111yGZYy]. CBT is the **most effective treatment** [^113SxDbp] for reducing tinnitus-related distress and improving quality of life, and should be offered to patients with bothersome tinnitus [^116cgkg5] [^115A1fZS]. Sound therapy and hearing aids [^115o6qoK] are appropriate for patients with hearing loss or as adjuncts to CBT [^1114arv1] [^117GJ4oG]. Pharmacologic options (e.g. antidepressants, anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines) [^1134HBVb] may be considered only for severe distress or comorbidities, with careful monitoring for side effects and limited evidence of benefit [^1178WiR2] [^111YM7Fr].

---

## Pharmacological treatments

### Antidepressants

- **Evidence**: Antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline, nortriptyline, sertraline, paroxetine) may reduce tinnitus severity and distress [^1178WiR2], especially with comorbid depression or anxiety [^113ye14h].
- **Limitations**: Benefits are modest and inconsistent [^1178WiR2]; side effects (e.g. sedation, sexual dysfunction, weight gain) are common [^113ye14h].
- **Guidelines**: Not recommended as first-line therapy [^1134HBVb]; consider only for severe distress or comorbid depression/anxiety.

---

### Anticonvulsants

Anticonvulsants such as gabapentin and carbamazepine show **limited benefit** for reducing tinnitus severity [^113ye14h]. Adverse effects — including dizziness, fatigue, and cognitive impairment [^113ye14h] — are common. Guidelines do not recommend them as first-line therapy [^1134HBVb] and suggest reserving them for severe distress or comorbidities.

---

### Benzodiazepines

Benzodiazepines can provide **short-term relief** [^113ye14h] of anxiety and distress associated with tinnitus. However, they carry risks of dependence [^113ye14h], sedation, cognitive impairment, and withdrawal symptoms. Accordingly, guidelines do not recommend them as first-line therapy [^1134HBVb] and advise reserving their use for short-term management in severe cases.

---

### Other pharmacological agents

- **Melatonin**: May improve sleep quality and reduce tinnitus distress, but evidence is limited [^1131Ym37].
- **Acamprosate**: Limited evidence suggests potential benefit, but not recommended as first-line therapy [^1178WiR2].
- **Ginkgo biloba**: No significant benefit demonstrated in clinical trials [^117Jb6Gj] [^1115PBPQ].

---

## Non-pharmacological treatments

### Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has **strong evidence** [^113SxDbp] for reducing tinnitus-related distress and improving quality of life [^116cgkg5]. Although CBT does not reduce tinnitus loudness, it improves coping [^113SxDbp] and the emotional response to symptoms. It is recommended as **first-line therapy** [^116cgkg5] for bothersome tinnitus [^115A1fZS].

---

### Sound therapy and hearing aids

- **Evidence**: Sound therapy and hearing aids [^115o6qoK] can reduce tinnitus perception and improve quality of life, especially with hearing loss.
- **Limitations**: Effectiveness varies [^1114arv1]; not all patients benefit equally.
- **Guidelines**: Recommended for patients with hearing loss or as adjuncts to CBT.

---

### Neuromodulation techniques

Neuromodulation techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have **limited supporting evidence** [^1124PYVV] for treating tinnitus [^116DJzrq]. These modalities are costly, have limited availability, and yield inconsistent results. They are **not recommended as first-line therapy** and should be considered only in specialized settings.

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Treatment** | **Evidence level** | **Recommended use** |
|-|-|-|
| Antidepressants [^1134HBVb] | Moderate | Severe distress or comorbid depression/anxiety |
| Anticonvulsants [^1178WiR2] | Low | Severe distress or comorbidities |
| Benzodiazepines [^113ye14h] | Low | Short-term use in severe cases |
| CBT [^113SxDbp] | High | First-line therapy |
| Sound therapy [^1114arv1] | Moderate | Adjunct to CBT or hearing loss |
| Hearing aids [^115o6qoK] | Moderate | Patients with hearing loss |
| Neuromodulation [^116DJzrq] | Low | Specialized settings only |

---

## Conclusion

No medication is recommended as **first-line therapy** [^1134HBVb] for tinnitus due to limited efficacy and potential side effects. CBT is the **most effective treatment** [^113SxDbp] for reducing tinnitus-related distress and improving quality of life. Sound therapy and hearing aids [^115o6qoK] are recommended for patients with hearing loss or as adjuncts to CBT [^1114arv1]. Pharmacological treatments may be considered only for severe distress or comorbidities [^1178WiR2] and require careful monitoring for side effects [^111YM7Fr].

### Efficacy of pharmacologic treatment in tinnitus patients without specific or treatable origin: A network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1178WiR2]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). High credibility.

Although tinnitus has a prevalence between 20% and 42.8%, the currently recommended management for tinnitus, such as tinnitus support and psychological therapies, is relatively time-consuming and expensive. Several new pharmacologic treatments designed for tinnitus patients without a specific origin have been developed, but their efficacy remains unclear.

- **Methods**: A network meta-analysis (NMA) of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of different pharmacologic treatments for tinnitus management in patients without a specific or treatable origin (i.e. primary tinnitus). Databases were searched from inception to April 5, 2021. All network meta-analytic procedures were conducted under the frequentist model. We calculated the effect size of outcomes with different rating scales using standardized mean difference. PROSPERO registration: CRD42020177742.

- **Findings**: Overall, 36 RCTs were included with 2,761 participants. The main results revealed that pharmacologic interventions with brain-acting effects (for example, amitriptyline, acamprosate, and gabapentin) and those with anti-inflammation/antioxidant effects (for example, intra-tympanic dexamethasone injection plus oral melatonin) were associated with superior improvement in tinnitus severity and response rates compared to placebo/control. Oral amitriptyline was associated with the highest improvement in tinnitus severity and the fourth highest response rate. None of the investigated interventions was associated with different changes in quality of life.

### Association of central noninvasive brain stimulation interventions with efficacy and safety in tinnitus management: A meta-analysis [^1124PYVV]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Tinnitus has a prevalence of 10% to 25% and is frequently associated with numerous complications, such as neuropsychiatric disease. Traditional treatments have failed to meet the needs of patients with tinnitus. Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) can focally modify cortical functioning and has been proposed as a strategy for reducing tinnitus severity. However, the results have been inconclusive.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the association between different central NIBS therapies and efficacy and acceptability for treatment of tinnitus.

- **Data sources**: ClinicalKey, Cochrane CENTRAL, Embase, ProQuest, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science databases were searched from inception to August 4, 2019. No language restriction was applied. Manual searches were performed for potentially eligible articles selected from the reference lists of review articles and pairwise meta-analyses.

- **Study selection**: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) examining the central NIBS method used in patients with unilateral or bilateral tinnitus were included in the network meta-analysis. The central NIBS method was compared with sham, waiting list, or active controls. Studies that were not clinical trials or RCTs and did not report the outcome of interest were excluded.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Two authors independently screened the studies, extracted the relevant information, and evaluated the risk of bias in the included studies. In cases of discrepancy, a third author became involved. If manuscript data were not available, the corresponding authors or coauthors were approached.

### Efficacy of pharmacologic treatment in tinnitus patients without specific or treatable origin: A network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^116P6YJg]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). High credibility.

Previous pairwise meta-analyses and systematic reviews have investigated the effects of Ginkgo biloba, zinc supplementation, and vitamin supplementation but failed to demonstrate a significant benefit in tinnitus treatment. Some of these interventions were designed for management in specific situations, such as zinc supplementation based on the rationale of zinc deficiency, but others were not. Only melatonin and intra-tympanic corticosteroid injections have shown promising results in some investigations. Similarly, the intra-tympanic corticosteroid injection focused on situations of local inflammation. Due to a lack of sufficient comparative evidence, guidelines declined the recommendation of pharmacologic interventions for tinnitus management. However, it has become increasingly difficult to conduct large-scale randomized controlled trials to compare different pharmacologic interventions simultaneously.

Network meta-analysis (NMA) is conducted using statistical methods to calculate direct and indirect comparisons between multiple treatments. Evidence from direct comparisons enables assessments between original randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Indirect comparison evidence primarily stems from the hypothesis of transitivity, a key component of NMA. Conducting an NMA of existing RCTs allows for the estimation of comparative efficacy and understanding of the relative merits of multiple interventions, maximizing statistical power, which cannot be accomplished with traditional pairwise meta-analysis.

### Psychopathological dimensions of tinnitus and psychopharmacologic approaches in its treatment [^113ye14h]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

The aim of this review is to investigate the presence of psychopathological states and the efficacy of psychopharmacological drugs in the treatment of tinnitus.

- **Materials and methods**: An extensive Internet search was performed through PubMed using related keywords in English.

- **Results**: Higher levels of anxiety and depression, along with somatoform disorder clusters, are identified in patients with tinnitus. Additionally, these individuals may exhibit impulsivity, hostility, demanding behavior, physical discomfort, health-related anxiety, emotionality, and suicidal tendencies. Personality characteristics such as depression, hysteria, and hypochondriac features are also common. More severe psychopathologies, like personality disorders, may be encountered in these patients.

Sertraline, paroxetine, and nortriptyline are considered first-line antidepressants for the psychopharmacological treatment of tinnitus. Some studies have reported the efficacy of sulpiride. Carbamazepine, valproate, and gabapentin can be effective as mood stabilizers. Short-acting benzodiazepines like alprazolam and midazolam are effective for symptoms of anxiety; clonazepam and diazepam may also be evaluated as options. Additionally, some glutamate receptor antagonists may be used in the treatment of tinnitus.

Disturbed sleep is frequently associated with tinnitus and can disrupt the quality of life in these patients. Cognitive-behavioral therapy may offer relief from tinnitus-related distress.

### Efficacy of pharmacologic treatment in tinnitus patients without specific or treatable origin: A network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1131Ym37]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). High credibility.

Another important finding of the network meta-analysis was the significantly higher response rate of intra-tympanic dexamethasone injection plus oral melatonin compared to the placebo/waiting-list group. Melatonin has both dopaminergic antagonist effects and antioxidant effects. The description of the tinnitus auditolimbic dopaminergic pathway, located within the prefrontal, primary temporal, temporoparietal associative areas, and the limbic system, shares cerebral structures with tinnitus perception; thus, it was considered a novel approach to tinnitus management. The overt oxidative stress and imbalance of antioxidant enzymes is considered one possible etiology of tinnitus. The supplementation of antioxidants such as melatonin has been shown to be effective in tinnitus management. Although the findings of potential benefits of melatonin in tinnitus management could support the hypothesis of a tinnitus auditolimbic dopaminergic pathway and overt oxidative stress in tinnitus, future clinical trials should focus on the etiology of tinnitus.

Based on the hypothesis of triggers of cochlear damage leading to the early development of tinnitus, an intra-tympanic steroid injection (i.e. dexamethasone) is theoretically a promising treatment modality for early-stage tinnitus originating from cochlear damage. The beneficial effects of dexamethasone on tinnitus might be derived from immune suppression, anti-inflammation, and sodium reabsorption in the inner ear through action on steroid receptors in the human temporal bone. The intra-tympanic administration route could result in regionally high perilymphatic dexameth.

Hearing aids

No randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigated hearing aid use as a primary intervention for tinnitus and obtained a validated outcome measure. Stephens and Corcoran did include a subgroup of individuals who received hearing aids (discussed later under sound enrichment). Sometimes hearing aid provision forms part of tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT), and therefore these studies are discussed later.

Counseling and psychological support

No specific RCTs involved counseling or psychological support. When counseling was provided, it was more appropriate to consider it as information/education, relaxation therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), or TRT.

Relaxation therapy

Three RCTs assessed the efficacy of relaxation therapies, providing low to moderate levels of evidence, with small to large effect sizes. Biesinger et al. examined the efficacy of Qigong, a mindful exercise and active relaxation technique. They reported high compliance and a significant mean improvement in Tinnitus Beeinträchtigungs Fragebogen Questionnaire scores in the intervention group versus the waiting-list control group. However, in this study, the control group reported a significantly higher baseline tinnitus severity, limiting the interpretative weight of their findings. In a second study, Ireland et al. compared group (progressive muscle) relaxation training to a waiting-list control. They found no significant differences in change on Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) or State-Trait Anxiety Inventory scores between groups. They did, however, note greater improvement in three participants who stated their tinnitus was stress related. This study was rated as low-level evidence and did not report a validated measure.

### Amplification with hearing aids for patients with tinnitus and co-existing hearing loss [^116sRXaF]. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Tinnitus is described as the perception of sound or noise in the absence of real acoustic stimulation. In the absence of a cure for tinnitus, clinical management typically focuses on reducing the effects of comorbid symptoms such as distress or hearing loss. Hearing loss is frequently comorbid with tinnitus; therefore, logic implies that amplification of external sounds by hearing aids will reduce the perception of the tinnitus sound and the distress associated with it.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of hearing aids specifically in terms of tinnitus benefit in patients with tinnitus and co-existing hearing loss.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP; and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 19 August 2013.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials and non-randomized controlled trials recruiting adults with subjective tinnitus and some degree of hearing loss, where the intervention involves amplification with hearing aids. This is compared to interventions involving other medical devices, other forms of standard or complementary therapy, combinations of therapies, no intervention, or placebo interventions.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three authors independently screened all selected abstracts. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed those potentially suitable studies for risk of bias.

### The placebo effect on tinnitus: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111yGZYy]. Otology & Neurotology (2024). High credibility.

To quantify the placebo effect in randomized clinical trials treating tinnitus with oral or intratympanic placebo treatment, data was sourced from CINAHL, PubMed, and Scopus. Articles were searched from conception to October 2022 using MESH and key terms such as "tinnitus", "placebo", and "medication" to find randomized, placebo-controlled trials. The search was limited to articles in English.

Randomized controlled trials with adult subjects evaluating tinnitus pretreatment and posttreatment with an oral or intratympanic medication versus a placebo arm were included. Crossover studies, studies involving middle/inner ear operations or devices, and studies exclusively involving nonidiopathic etiologies of tinnitus were excluded. Mean tinnitus symptom survey scores for the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI), Tinnitus Severity Index, Tinnitus Functional Index, Tinnitus Handicap Questionnaire, and Visual Analog Scales for tinnitus Intensity/Loudness (VAS-L), Annoyance (VAS-An), and Awareness (VAS-Aw) were extracted for both placebo and experimental groups.

Out of 953 studies screened, 23 studies were included in the final analysis. The meta-analysis of mean difference (MD) was calculated using RevMan 5.4. The MD between pretreatment and posttreatment THI scores of the placebo arms was 5.6 (95% confidence interval, 3.3–8.0; p < 0.001). The MD between pretreatment and posttreatment VAS scores of the placebo groups for loudness, annoyance, and awareness were 0.8 (0.0 to 1.6, p = 0.05), 0.2 (-0.2 to 0.5, p = 0.34), and 0.3 (-0.0 to 0.7, p = 0.08), respectively.

### Effect of tinnitus retraining therapy vs standard of care on tinnitus-related quality of life: A randomized clinical trial [^115S9HZC]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) is an internationally recognized, but controversial, protocol of uncertain efficacy that uses tinnitus-specific educational counseling (TC) and sound therapy (ST) to reduce the patient's tinnitus-evoked negative reaction to, and awareness of, tinnitus. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of TRT and its components, ST and TC, with the standard of care (SoC) in reducing the negative effect of tinnitus on quality of life.

A randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter phase 3 trial was conducted from August 4, 2011, to June 20, 2017, at six US military hospitals, the study chair's office, and a data coordinating center among 151 active-duty and retired military personnel and dependents with functionally adequate hearing sensitivity and moderate to severe subjective tinnitus. All analyses were based on intention to treat. Central randomized allocation was made to TRT (TC and ST with conventional sound generators), partial TRT (TC with placebo sound generators), or SoC.

The primary outcome was the mean change on the Tinnitus Questionnaire (TQ), assessed longitudinally between baseline and 18 months after the start of therapy. Secondary outcomes included changes in TQ subscales, Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI), and Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) total and subscales, as well as a 10-point visual analog scale (VAS).

Among the 151 participants in the study (44 women and 107 men; mean [SD] age, 50.6 [11.3] years), 51 were randomized to receive TRT, while another 51 were assigned to receive pa…

### Efficacy of nortriptyline-topiramate and verapamil-paroxetine in tinnitus management: A randomized placebo-controlled trial [^116t4JgH]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

To evaluate the efficacy of two drug combinations on tinnitus severity and associated stress, depression, sleep, and anxiety, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted between 2019 and 2023 for an 8-week duration at a single institution tertiary care center.

The study recruited adult patients with moderate to severe tinnitus for six months or more. In total, 81 patients were assessed for eligibility, 78 were enrolled and randomized, and 67 were included in the per-protocol analysis. Patients were randomized into three groups on a 1:1:1 ratio. Group NT received nortriptyline-topiramate, group VP received verapamil-paroxetine, and group P received a placebo.

A total of 19 patients in group NT, 22 in group VP, and 26 patients in group P were included in the per-protocol analysis. In group NT, the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) score decreased from 58.4 ± 13.9 (baseline) to 46.3 ± 17.5 (end-of-trial) (p < 0.001). Similarly, in group VP, the TFI score decreased from 54.6 ± 17.5 to 42.2 ± 16.1 (P = .004). However, group P did not demonstrate any significant decrease in the TFI score from 51.2 ± 18.6 to 45.2 ± 20.1 (P = .086). The between-arm analysis did not yield any statistically significant decrease in the TFI score (analysis of variance, P = .265).

Both combinations of drugs were promising in improving tinnitus severity. However, larger-scale trials with longer follow-up periods are warranted to validate our findings between groups.

### VA/DoD clinical practice guideline for tinnitus [^116DJzrq]. VA/DoD (2024). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for tinnitus, specifically concerning neuromodulation, the DoD/VA 2024 guidelines cite insufficient evidence to recommend for, or against the following interventions for the management of tinnitus:

- **Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation**: There is a lack of conclusive evidence supporting its efficacy.

- **Transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation**: Current data do not definitively support its use.

- **Transcranial direct stimulation**: Further research is necessary to establish its effectiveness.

### The neuropsychiatry of tinnitus: A circuit-based approach to the causes and treatments available [^115y1Zun]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Patients presenting with tinnitus commonly exhibit neuropsychiatric symptoms, which physicians need to be familiar with. This paper provides an overview of tinnitus, including its types and pathophysiology. Recent methods such as transcranial magnetic stimulation, positron emission tomography, MRI, magnetoencephalography, and quantitative EEG are discussed as tools to improve our understanding of tinnitus's pathophysiology, connecting it to neuropsychiatric symptoms.

The role of neuropsychiatry in treating tinnitus patients is explored, with specific attention given to psychiatric issues such as depression, anxiety, and personality disorders. Additionally, the association of stress, headache, cognitive processing speed, and sleep disturbances with tinnitus is examined.

The paper gives a brief overview of treatment options and evaluates the efficacy of various medications, including benzodiazepines, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and mood-stabilizing agents. Non-pharmacological treatment options such as cognitive behavioral therapy, habituation therapy, and acupuncture are also discussed. Furthermore, the development of brain stimulation therapies for the treatment of tinnitus is highlighted.

In conclusion, a review of the literature demonstrates the varied neuropsychiatric manifestations of tinnitus. Imaging studies provide insights into the mechanisms underlying these associations. However, further research is necessary to elucidate the neurocircuitry involved in these associations.

### Systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials examining tinnitus management [^116srv8H]. The Laryngoscope (2011). Low credibility.

Study quality was based on a subset of extracted data. The quality assessment tool was based on one reported previously. For each criterion, a score of 2 was applied if the study met the criterion to a high standard, 1 if it partly met the criterion, or a score of 0 if it was flawed or if the relevant information was not stated. Two authors scored studies independently before agreeing on a final score for each criterion and each study. The potential overall quality score varied from 0 to 16, giving grades of evidence from very low (0–4), low (5–8), moderate (9–12) to high (13–16). Qualitative descriptors for these grades are given in Oxman et al. Essentially, the lower the level of evidence, the more likely further studies are to impact our confidence in the estimate of effect and are likely to change that estimate. Only high-level evidence studies provide conclusive evidence, after which additional research is unlikely to change the estimate of effect.

- **Data synthesis and meta-analyses**: Where studies were sufficiently similar, a meta-analysis was performed. Similarity is defined here as the same intervention and outcome measure, and low heterogeneity. The test for heterogeneity is detailed below. Where studies were not sufficiently similar to conduct a meta-analysis, data were synthesized using a narrative approach. All analyses were performed in R using libraries rmeta, epiR, and meta.

- **Effect size calculation for individual studies**: For each study, Cohen's d effect size was calculated for the primary treatment intervention and primary measure of change.

### Ginkgo biloba for tinnitus [^117Jb6Gj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2004, and previously updated in 2007 and 2009. Tinnitus can be described as the perception of sound in the absence of external acoustic stimulation. At present, no specific therapy for tinnitus is acknowledged to be satisfactory for all patients. There are a number of reports in the literature suggesting that Ginkgo biloba may be effective in the management of tinnitus. However, there also appears to be a strong placebo effect in tinnitus management.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effect of Ginkgo biloba in patients who are troubled by tinnitus.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; AMED; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was March 12, 2012.

- **Selection criteria**: Adults (18 years and over) complaining of tinnitus or adults with a primary complaint of cerebral insufficiency, where tinnitus forms part of the syndrome.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Both original authors independently extracted data and assessed trials for quality. For the 2012 update, two authors determined trial eligibility, extracted data, analyzed data, and updated the contents of the review.

- **Main results**: Four trials with a total of 1,543 participants were included in the review. We assessed all the included studies as having a low risk of bias.

### Evaluation and management of tinnitus: Are there opportunities for improvement [^115B6tRF]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to review information about the diagnosis and management of tinnitus, aiming to identify opportunities for achieving a cost-effective, efficient, evidence-based approach that meets the needs of tinnitus sufferers.

- **Data sources**: The primary data source for this review was PubMed/MEDLINE.

- **Review methods**: A total of 249 relevant published reports were reviewed. Pertinent keywords and MeSH terms facilitated report identification via PubMed and EMBASE. Acknowledged experts were consulted for ways to improve tinnitus management.

- **Conclusions**: There may be opportunities to improve the evaluation and management of patients with tinnitus by utilizing modern modes of communication and a multidisciplinary therapeutic approach.

- **Implications for practice**: Tinnitus can adversely affect quality of life while being time-consuming and costly to evaluate and manage. Based on both personal experience and the reports of others, patients with tinnitus who choose to see a physician primarily want to know two things: (1) that the tinnitus, which is so distressing, will not remain at the same level of severity forever and (2) that something can be done to help cope with the tinnitus that is so annoying. Recent advancements in internet communications, social media, information technology, artificial intelligence, machine learning, holistic medical care, mind-body integrative health care, and multidisciplinary approaches in medical therapeutics may offer new ways of meeting the needs of patients with tinnitus.

### A systematic review of eligibility and outcomes in tinnitus trials: Reassessment of tinnitus guideline [^113txQya]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

To analyze existing tinnitus treatment trials, the study focused on eligibility criteria, outcome measures, study quality, and external validity. It also examined the impact of patient demographics, symptom duration, severity, and otologic comorbidity on research findings to assist practitioners in applying these findings to patient encounters.

- **Data sources**: A systematic literature search was conducted by an information specialist for the development of the American Academy of Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery Foundation's tinnitus clinical practice guideline.

- **Review methods**: Articles were assessed for eligibility using the PRISMA protocol (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses), and data were extracted by two independent investigators. Studies were evaluated for methodological quality, inclusion and exclusion criteria, patient demographics, and outcome measures.

- **Results**: A total of 147 randomized trials met the inclusion criteria. Nearly all studies were conducted in a specialist setting. More than 50% did not explicitly define tinnitus, and 44% used a subjective severity threshold, such as "severely disturbing". Fifty-four percent required a symptom duration of at least 6 months for study eligibility, and up to 33% excluded patients with "organic" hearing loss or otologic conditions. The mean age of participants was 52.2 years, and the median follow-up was 3 months. Only 20% of the trials presented a low risk of bias.

- **Conclusion**: Randomized trials of tinnitus interventions are most applicable to older adults with tinnitus lasting ≥ 6 months who are evaluated in specialty settings. The trials often exhibited a high risk of bias and had short follow-up periods.

### Tinnitus: Diagnosis and management [^111YM7Fr]. American Family Physician (2021).

Tinnitus is the sensation of hearing a sound in the absence of an internal or external source and is a common problem encountered in primary care. Most cases of tinnitus are benign and idiopathic and are strongly associated with sensorineural hearing loss. A standard workup begins with a targeted history and physical examination to identify treatable causes and associated symptoms that may improve with treatment. Less common but potentially dangerous causes such as vascular tumors and vestibular schwannoma should be ruled out.

A comprehensive audiologic evaluation should be performed for patients who experience unilateral tinnitus, tinnitus that has been present for six months or longer, or tinnitus that is accompanied by hearing problems. Neuroimaging is not part of the standard workup unless the tinnitus is asymmetric or unilateral, pulsatile, associated with focal neurologic abnormalities, or associated with asymmetric hearing loss.

Cognitive behavioral therapy is the only treatment that has been shown to improve the quality of life in patients with tinnitus. Sound therapy and tinnitus retraining therapy are treatment options, but evidence is inconclusive. Melatonin, antidepressants, and cognitive training may help with sleep disturbance, mood disorders, and cognitive impairments, respectively. Avoidance of noise exposure may help prevent the development or progression of tinnitus. Providing information about the natural progression of tinnitus and being familiar with the causes that warrant additional evaluation, imaging, and specialist involvement are essential to comprehensive care.

### Systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials examining tinnitus management [^113kyW4P]. The Laryngoscope (2011). Low credibility.

Tinnitus care and research have long been, and continue to be, a challenge. The efficacy of most tinnitus management interventions recommended for clinical practice remains to be demonstrated conclusively, as there are currently too few studies to make informed conclusions. Most studies reviewed here provide only moderate levels of evidence, largely due to a lack of power and incomplete data reporting.

- **Interventions in need of high-level evidence studies**: Hearing aids/sound enrichment and TRT. The efficacy of therapist-delivered CBT appears to be reasonably established. However, if audiologists are to deliver CBT, this will require new investigation.
- **CBT studies quality**: Although the overall quality of CBT studies is moderate, there is sufficient consistency within these results to be confident of its benefit for tinnitus intrusiveness.
- **Pharmacotherapy**: Only antidepressant use shows any evidence of potential benefit.

### Comparing the multi-disciplinary approach utilizing cognitive behavioral therapy and sound therapy to standard audiological treatment in chronic tinnitus patients: Impact on severity reduction and quality of life improvement [^117NbsyV]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2025). High credibility.

To compare the impact of a multi-disciplinary approach utilizing cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and sound therapy (ST) in chronic tinnitus patients, the clinical data of 111 adult patients with chronic tinnitus were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into the CBT + ST group (CBT + ST, n = 55) and the standard group (standard therapy, n = 56). Baseline demographic characteristics, severity of tinnitus symptoms, audiometric measures, quality of life scores, treatment efficacy, and anxiety and depression scores were evaluated.

The CBT + ST group significantly reduced tinnitus severity scores compared to the control, including improvements on the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory, Tinnitus Functional Index, and Tinnitus Visual Analog Scale. Audiological measures revealed improved hearing thresholds and speech recognition in the CBT + ST group. Additionally, CBT + ST improved quality of life with significantly higher percentages of complete and partial treatment responses and lower anxiety and depression scores compared to the standard group.

In conclusion, the multi-disciplinary approach utilizing CBT + ST effectively reduces tinnitus severity, improves quality of life, and enhances treatment efficacy.

### Tinnitus [^115ibVqy]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2009). Low credibility.

Up to 18% of people in industrialized societies are mildly affected by chronic tinnitus, and 0.5% report tinnitus having a severe effect on their daily life. Tinnitus can be associated with hearing loss, acoustic neuromas, drug toxicity, ear diseases, and depression. It can last for many years and interfere with sleep and concentration.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for chronic tinnitus? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2009. Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review. We included harms alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 27 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: acamprosate, acupuncture, antidepressant drugs, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, cinnarizine, electromagnetic stimulation, ginkgo biloba, hearing aids, hypnosis, psychotherapy, tinnitus-masking devices, and tinnitus retraining therapy.

### Sound therapy (masking) in the management of tinnitus in adults [^113mtEcb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 12, 2010. Tinnitus is described as the perception of sound or noise in the absence of real acoustic stimulation. Numerous management strategies have been tried for this potentially debilitating, heterogeneous symptom. External noise has been used as a management tool for tinnitus in different capacities and with different philosophical intent for over a century.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of sound-creating devices (including hearing aids) in the management of tinnitus in adults. Primary outcome measures were changes in the loudness or severity of tinnitus and/or impact on quality of life. Secondary outcome measures were change in pure-tone auditory thresholds and adverse effects of treatment.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane ENT Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, BIOSIS Previews, Cambridge Scientific Abstracts, ICTRP, and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 8 February 2012.

- **Selection criteria**: Prospective randomized controlled trials recruiting adults with persistent, distressing, subjective tinnitus of any etiology in which the management strategy included maskers, noise-generating devices, and/or hearing aids, used either as the sole management tool or in combination with other strategies, including counseling.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently examined the 387 search results to identify studies for inclusion in the review.

### Bimodal neuromodulation combining sound and tongue stimulation reduces tinnitus symptoms in a large randomized clinical study [^11458Nk3]. Science Translational Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Tinnitus is a phantom auditory perception coded in the brain that can be bothersome or debilitating, affecting 10 to 15% of the population. Currently, there is no clinically recommended drug or device treatment for this major health condition. Animal research has revealed that sound paired with electrical somatosensory stimulation can drive extensive plasticity within the brain for tinnitus treatment. To investigate this bimodal neuromodulation approach in humans, we evaluated a noninvasive device that delivers sound to the ears and electrical stimulation to the tongue in a randomized, double-blinded, exploratory study that enrolled 326 adults with chronic subjective tinnitus.

Participants were randomized into three parallel arms with different stimulation settings. Clinical outcomes were evaluated over a 12-week treatment period and a 12-month posttreatment phase. For the primary endpoints, participants achieved a statistically significant reduction in tinnitus symptom severity at the end of treatment based on two commonly used outcome measures, Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (Cohen's d effect size: -0.87 to -0.92 across arms; P < 0.001) and Tinnitus Functional Index (-0.77 to -0.87; P < 0.001). Therapeutic improvements continued for 12 months after treatment for specific bimodal stimulation settings, which had not previously been demonstrated in a large cohort for a tinnitus intervention. The treatment also achieved high compliance and satisfaction rates with no treatment-related serious adverse events. These positive therapeutic and long-term results motivate further clinical investigations.

### Tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) for tinnitus [^111Ez2eC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). High credibility.

Tinnitus is described as the perception of sound or noise in the absence of real acoustic stimulation. Although an outright cure for tinnitus remains elusive, various management strategies have been developed to help lessen the impact of the symptom. Following the publication of a neurophysiological model of tinnitus, Tinnitus Retraining Therapy (TRT) was developed. Using a combination of directive counseling and sound therapy in a strict framework, this is one of the most commonly used treatment modalities for tinnitus. Many studies refer to the use of TRT where a modified version of this therapy is actually being implemented. It is, therefore, important to confirm the use of authentic TRT when reviewing any study that reports its use.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy of TRT in the treatment of tinnitus.

- **Search strategy**: The search included the Cochrane ENT Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, EMBASE, and reference lists of identified publications. The date of the most recent search was August 26, 2009.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials of TRT versus no treatment, or other forms of treatment, in adult patients with tinnitus.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Both authors critically appraised the retrieved studies for risk of bias and extracted data independently. Where necessary, we contacted the original study authors for further information.

- **Main results**: Only one trial (123 participants) was included in the review. Several excluded trials did not follow the strict protocol for TRT.

### Efficacy of pharmacologic treatment in tinnitus patients without specific or treatable origin: A network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1153DpPE]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). High credibility.

A total of 87 articles were considered for full-text review (Fig. 1), of which 51 were excluded for various reasons (Suppl. B, eTable 2). Finally, 36 articles were included in the study (Suppl. B, eTable 3).

- **Network meta-analysis findings**:
	- Fig. 2 depicts the geometric distribution of the treatment arms. Specifically, in Fig. 2, the lines between nodes represent direct comparisons in various trials, and the size of each circle is proportional to the size of the population involved in each specific treatment. The thickness of the lines is proportional to the number of trials connected to the network.

- **Characteristics of the included studies**:
	- A total of 2761 participants were included, with a mean age of 52.3 years (range: 39.0 to 72.6 years) and a mean female proportion of 45.5% (range: 10.7 to 65.9%). The mean treatment duration was 11.9 weeks (range: 2 to 24 weeks). The baseline characteristics of the included participants are summarized in Suppl. B, eTable 3. The definition of response varied among participants.

### Initial response to combination therapies for tinnitus: Lessons learned from a retrospective analysis [^111rLUg2]. Otology & Neurotology (2024). High credibility.

To investigate the initial reduction of tinnitus effects, common therapies applicable in general otology clinics were combined to establish optimal treatment strategies. The study was a retrospective cohort study conducted at a tertiary university hospital.

The patients included were those with nonpulsatile subjective tinnitus who visited the hospital between January and December 2022. Combination therapies consisted of at least one of the following:

- **Directive counseling**: Based on the neurophysiological model.
- **Hearing aids**
- **Medication**
- **Neuromodulation**

The main outcome measures were the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) questionnaire at both the initial visit and 1-month follow-up. A total of 151 patients were enrolled. THI improvement of 20 points or more was observed in 31.8% of participants. One-way analysis of variance revealed that counseling had a significant reduction in THI, whereas neuromodulation, medication, and hearing aids did not. THI improvement was significantly associated with received counseling, severity of initial THI, and mean loudness discomfort level. Hearing aids and neuromodulation were not significant prognostic factors for improvement.

In conclusion, counseling alone is the best treatment for most patients with tinnitus. However, there will be patients with tinnitus who, in addition to counseling, would benefit from hearing aids, medications, and/or certain forms of neuromodulation.

### Systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials examining tinnitus management [^113qdfhk]. The Laryngoscope (2011). Low credibility.

The aim of this review was to evaluate the evidence base for those tinnitus management interventions recommended by the Department of Health's Good Practice Guide. Where possible, we aimed to identify the conditions under which these interventions are efficacious, and consider whether these interventions are sufficiently researched or in need of further study. We also asked which patients benefit most, but report little on this question due to limited information in those studies reviewed.

In a previous review of RCTs of tinnitus interventions, Dobie did not find any that demonstrated a significant benefit of intervention over typically large placebo effects. He concluded that nowhere in the literature were there studies similar enough to attempt meta-analysis. Two recommendations from that review were that future RCTs needed consensus outcome measures and adequate sample sizes. There is now reasonable consensus in the tinnitus research community on which validated measures to use. In this review, the most widely used tinnitus questionnaire was the TRQ. It appeared in 10 of the 28 studies and was used here in two separate meta-analyses. However, only seven of the 28 studies used a power calculation to estimate their required sample size. Therefore, more than 10 years on, although we have greater RCT-level evidence and some opportunities for meta-analysis, there is still little evidence for the efficacy of most recommended treatment strategies.

It is striking that many authors ascribed null results for changes in depression and anxiety to the fact that participants…

### Systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials examining tinnitus management [^114ZWDg1]. The Laryngoscope (2011). Low credibility.

The "phantom" auditory experience of tinnitus affects 10% to 15% of people in the United Kingdom. It is most clearly associated with noise exposure and aging and can present with comorbid sleep disturbance, hearing difficulty, social withdrawal, and negative emotional reactions such as anxiety and depression. Although a majority of tinnitus patients are male and present with some form of hearing loss, particularly higher-frequency steeply sloping hearing loss, there is no typical characteristic history or level of distress for the help-seeking tinnitus patient.

In the United Kingdom, the Department of Health issued a Good Practice Guide (GPG) for the commissioning of tinnitus services and for the clinical assessment and management of tinnitus patients. It recommends that tinnitus severity is assessed using either the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) or the Tinnitus Questionnaire. It also recommends that psychological comorbidity is assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory or the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). However, questionnaire use in clinical practice is limited.

In terms of management, therapeutic targets include the sound itself (i.e. interrupt the neural signal generating the sound) or the associated symptoms of distress, anxiety, or depression that can accompany tinnitus. The GPG states that tinnitus patients will be given, as appropriate, information/education, hearing aids, counseling and psychological support, relaxation therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with the requisite professional support.

### Neurostimulation as a new treatment for severe tinnitus: a pilot study [^114pMcoR]. Otology & Neurotology (2005). Low credibility.

Tinnitus is an uncomfortable symptom for patients and an embarrassing one for consulted physicians. Currently, there is no treatment established for long-term tinnitus reduction exceeding placebo effects. There is considerable evidence suggesting pathophysiological similarities between tinnitus and chronic pain, where some chronic pain forms respond to neurostimulation.

- **Objective**: This study investigated the feasibility of cochlear nerve neurostimulation for tinnitus reduction.

- **Study design**: Pilot study conducted at a tertiary referral center.

- **Patients**: Five patients with therapeutically refractory tinnitus participated in the study.

- **Intervention**: A stimulation lead was placed around the cochlear nerve using a suboccipital approach and connected to a pulse generator.

- **Main outcome measures**: Patients reported the absence of major or minor complications such as death, meningitis, cranial nerve deficits, and vestibular issues. Furthermore, tolerance of the procedure and relief of tinnitus in at least one patient were assessed.

- **Results**: The neurostimulation system was successfully implanted in all patients without difficulty. The treatment was bearable, with no major or minor complications occurring. Four patients experienced subjective tinnitus reduction.

In conclusion, our preliminary data indicate that cochlear nerve neurostimulation is feasible, bearable for patients, and safe.

### Music therapy for tinnitus: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114NAHUS]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2024). Low credibility.

To evaluate the clinical efficacy of music therapy in the treatment of tinnitus, three English databases (PUBMED, Embase, Web of Science) and three Chinese databases (CNKI, VIP, and Wanfang) were searched. Eligible articles were selected according to the set inclusion criteria. Clinical efficacy was used as the primary outcome, and each score was used as the secondary outcome, with statistical analysis performed using RevMan5.3 software.

A total of 14 studies involving 1,239 tinnitus patients were included. The results of the meta-analysis showed that music therapy had a certain clinical efficacy in the treatment of tinnitus; however, there was no significant difference compared with the control group (OR = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.83–1.22; P = 1.00). Music therapy significantly improved the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) score (MD = -6.77, 95% CI = -9.62 to -3.92; P < 0.00001), Tinnitus Sample Case Questionnaire (TSQ) (MD = -2.80, 95% CI = -3.23 to -2.36; P < 0.00001), tinnitus loudness (MD = -3.90, 95% CI = -6.58 to -1.23; P = 0.004), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score (MD = -1.11, 95% CI = -2.11 to -0.11; P = 0.03), and Tinnitus Questionnaire (TQ) score (MD = -8.36, 95% CI = -11.10 to -5.62; P < 0.001).

Music therapy is an effective method for the treatment of tinnitus, which can improve the THI score, tinnitus severity, VAS score, and TQ score, and reduce the loudness of tinnitus. Due to the low quality of the included literature, the conclusions need to be further verified by more and higher-quality studies.

### Efficacy of pharmacologic treatment in tinnitus patients without specific or treatable origin: A network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114kH7Aq]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). High credibility.

Although tinnitus has a prevalence between 20 and 42.8%, the currently recommended management for tinnitus, such as tinnitus support and psychological therapies, are relatively time-consuming and expensive. Several new pharmacologic treatments designed for tinnitus patients without a specific origin have been developed; however, their efficacy remains unclear.

- **Methods**: The network meta-analysis (NMA) of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of different pharmacologic treatments for tinnitus management in tinnitus patients without specific or treatable origin (i.e. primary tinnitus). Databases were searched from inception to April 5, 2021. All network meta-analytic procedures were conducted under the frequentist model. We calculated the effect size of outcomes with different rating scales using standardized mean difference. The study was registered in PROSPERO: CRD42020177742.

- **Findings**: Overall, 36 RCTs were included with 2,761 participants. The main results revealed that pharmacologic interventions with a brain-acting effect (e.g. amitriptyline, acamprosate, and gabapentin) and those with an anti-inflammation/anti-oxidant effect (e.g. intra-tympanic dexamethasone injection plus oral melatonin) were associated with superior improvement in tinnitus severity and response rate compared to placebo/control. Oral amitriptyline was associated with the highest improvement in tinnitus severity and the fourth highest response rate. None of the investigated interventions was associated with significant changes in quality of life.

### Systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials examining tinnitus management [^113oKyw9]. The Laryngoscope (2011). Low credibility.

Of the 28 studies identified, six were rated as low-level evidence, 17 as moderate, and five as high-level evidence (Table I). Unsurprisingly, four of the high-level trials involved drug therapies. Only one high-level trial of CBT was identified. For therapies involving sound enrichment or TRT, studies were rated as providing little or no evidence above low-level.

The main factor limiting study quality was the blinding of participants to the intervention or expected outcome, and the blinding of investigators to the expected outcome. There are ethical limitations to blinding that may be insurmountable; it would be unethical to deliver a psychological intervention such as CBT in a way that is misleading. Blinding of investigators, however, could be used more routinely as outcomes can easily be measured by a researcher who is blind to the intervention received. Only six of 28 studies reported the use of blinding, five of which were drug trials.

Use of appropriate controls is an issue. Given the nature of some tinnitus management interventions, a three-armed controlled design seems most appropriate, such as comparing a formal intervention like CBT or TRT to a simpler intervention such as a self-help book, and including a no-intervention or waiting-list control. This design was used in some studies reviewed here and partly controls for placebo/nonspecific effects (e.g. learning more about tinnitus, clinical contact time), helping to identify which components of the treatments are likely responsible for change.

Adequate numbers of participants are also important for ensuring robust findings.

### Neuromodulation for treatment of tinnitus: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114DpxcN]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to evaluate the treatment efficacy of neuromodulation versus sham for the treatment of tinnitus.

- **Data sources**: Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PubMed, and Scopus were used.

- **Review methods**: The Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PubMed, and Scopus were searched from inception through May 2023 for English language articles documenting "neuromodulation" and "tinnitus" stratified by sham-controlled randomized control trials with 40 or more patients. Data collected included the Beck Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI), Tinnitus Questionnaire, and Visual Analog Scale. A meta-analysis of continuous measures (mean) and proportions (%) was conducted.

- **Results**: A total of 19 randomized controlled trials (N = 1186) were included. The mean age was 48.4 ± 5.3 years (range: 19–74), with a mean duration of tinnitus of 3.8 ± 3.4 years. The study population was 61% [56.2–65.7] male, with 55.7% [46–65] having unilateral tinnitus. The short-term effect of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation on the THI score was -16.2 [-23.1 to -9.3], and for transcranial direct stimulation, it was -19 [-30.1 to -7.8]. The long-term effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on the THI score was -8.6 [-11.5 to -5.7]. Transcranial direct stimulation decreased the BDI score by -11.8 [-13.3 to -10.3].

- **Conclusion**: As measured by the Tinnitus Handicap Index, the findings suggest that the effects of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and transcranial direct stimulation reach significant benefits in the short term, whereas repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation reaches significant benefits in the long term.

### Cost-effectiveness of specialized treatment based on cognitive behavioral therapy versus usual care for tinnitus [^115o81NL]. Otology & Neurotology (2014). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of specialized multidisciplinary tinnitus treatment based on cognitive behavioral therapy, compared with care as usual.

- **Design**: The study utilizes a randomized controlled trial including an economic evaluation from a health-care and societal perspective, using a one-year time horizon.

- **Setting**: The research was conducted at an audiologic center.

- **Patients**: A referred sample of 626 patients with tinnitus were initially eligible for participation. Approximately 492 patients were eventually included in the study. Eighty-six (35%) of 247 patients in the usual care group and 74 (30%) of 245 patients in the specialized care group were lost to follow-up by month 12.

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary outcomes were quality adjusted life years (QALYs) as measured with the Health Utilities Index Mark III and the cost in US dollars.

- **Results**: Patients who received specialized care gained on average 0.015 QALYs (95% bootstrapped confidence interval [BCI], -0.03 to 0.06) compared with those receiving usual care. The incremental costs from a societal perspective were $357 (95% BCI, -$1,034 to $1,785). The incremental cost per QALY from a societal perspective amounted to $24,580. The probability that specialized care is cost-effective from a societal perspective is 58% for a willingness to pay for a QALY of $45,000.

- **Conclusion**: Specialized multidisciplinary tinnitus treatment based on cognitive behavioral therapy is cost-effective as compared with usual care. Despite the considerable uncertainty surrounding the incremental costs and effects, sensitivity analysis indicated that the cost-effectiveness results were robust.

### Prevalence, severity, exposures, and treatment patterns of tinnitus in the United States [^116M95YZ]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2016). High credibility.

Tinnitus is a common problem for millions of individuals and can substantially negatively impact their quality of life. A large epidemiologic study of tinnitus and its management patterns in the US adult population is lacking.

- **Objectives**: To quantify the epidemiologic features and effect of tinnitus and to analyze the management of tinnitus in the United States relative to the 2014 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) clinical practice guidelines.

- **Design, methods, and participants**: This cross-sectional analysis of the representative 2007 National Health Interview Survey (raw data, 75,764 respondents) identified a weighted national sample of adults (age, ≥ 18 years) who reported tinnitus in the preceding 12 months. Data were collected in November 2014 at the University of California, Irvine, and Harvard Medical School.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: In addition to quantifying the prevalence, severity, duration, and regularity of tinnitus, specific data regarding noise exposure and tinnitus management patterns during health care visits were analyzed.

- **Results**: Among an estimated (SE) 222.1 (3.4) million US adults, 21.4 (3.4) million (9.6% [0.3%]) experienced tinnitus in the past 12 months. Among those who reported tinnitus, 27% had symptoms for longer than 15 years, and 36% had nearly constant symptoms. Higher rates of tinnitus were reported in those with consistent exposure to loud noises at work (odds ratio, 3.3; 95% CI, 2.9–3.7) and during recreational time (odds ratio, 2.6; 95% CI, 2.3–2.9).

### Sound therapy and aural rehabilitation for tinnitus: A person centred therapy framework based on an ecological model of tinnitus [^114cxbtZ]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2019). Low credibility.

Tinnitus is a common oto-neurological complaint often accompanying hearing loss. In this perspective on rehabilitation, we describe a framework for sound therapy and aural rehabilitation of tinnitus based on the ecological model of tinnitus. A thematic network analysis-based approach was used to relate aural rehabilitation methods to the ecological model of tinnitus and the client-oriented scale of improvement in tinnitus.

Aural rehabilitation methods were mapped to concepts of: (1) context, (2) presence of sound, and (3) reaction to sound. A global theme was adaptation to sound. The framework is the result of an iterative and cumulative research program exploring tinnitus as the outcome of the relationship between individual psychoacoustics and psychosocial factors, including context of perception. The intent of this framework is to help guide audiologists managing tinnitus. The framework has been useful in our clinic, as illustrated by a case study. The benefits of this approach relative to standard care need to be independently ascertained.

Implications for rehabilitation: Tinnitus is a common oto-neurological complaint that, when severe, can be very disabling. Tinnitus is very heterogeneous; as a consequence, no one treatment is suitable for everyone. The sound therapy and aural rehabilitation for tinnitus framework is designed to assist audiologists in clinical planning that addresses individual needs. The framework is the result of an iterative and cumulative research program exploring tinnitus as the outcome of the relationship between various factors.

### Betahistine for tinnitus [^111QpPu2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). High credibility.

Tinnitus is defined as the perception of sound in the absence of an external source. In England alone, an estimated 750,000 general practice consultations occur every year where the primary complaint is tinnitus, equating to a major burden on healthcare services. Clinical management strategies include education and advice, relaxation therapy, tinnitus retraining therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy, sound enrichment using ear-level sound generators or hearing aids, and drug therapies to manage co-morbid symptoms such as sleep difficulties, anxiety, or depression. As yet, no drug has been approved for tinnitus by a regulatory body. Nonetheless, over 100,000 prescriptions for betahistine are being filled every month in England, and nearly 10% of general practitioners prescribe betahistine for tinnitus.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of betahistine in patients with subjective idiopathic tinnitus.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, via the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP, and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 23 July 2018.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) recruiting patients of any age with acute or chronic subjective idiopathic tinnitus were included. We included studies where the intervention involved betahistine, and this was compared to placebo, no intervention, or education and information.

### Efficacy of pharmacologic treatment in tinnitus patients without specific or treatable origin: A network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114pPax3]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). High credibility.

Among the adult population, tinnitus has a global prevalence of approximately 20%. Moreover, the economic burden to manage tinnitus resulted in a total healthcare bill of GB£750 million per annum in the United Kingdom in 2016 and estimated healthcare costs at US$660 per patient per year in the United States. Tinnitus has been recognised as a difficult disease to define and manage owing to controversy regarding its definition and treatment.

Several potential aetiological sources underlie tinnitus symptoms development, including the peripheral auditory system, the tinnitus auditolimbic dopaminergic pathway, or overt oxidative stress or imbalance of antioxidant enzymes. Although somatic treatments can be effective in cases of tinnitus with a specific origin (such as palatal myoclonus, deafferentation of the auditory system, loss of cochlear hair cells, and ototoxic drugs), the efficacy of traditional pharmacologic treatment to reduce tinnitus severity has been controversial in tinnitus with unknown etiology.

The currently recommended management for tinnitus, such as tinnitus support and psychological therapies, is relatively time-consuming and expensive. Furthermore, the management of tinnitus support and psychological therapy involved prolonged person-to-person contact, which would increase the risk of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic era. Several pharmacologic treatments or nutrient supplementation strategies have been developed in recent decades. For example, antioxidant supplementation, such as melatonin, ginkgo biloba, and vitamin C, has been suggested.

### Systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials examining tinnitus management [^1178sJte]. The Laryngoscope (2011). Low credibility.

Four studies examined the efficacy of CBT delivered as group sessions by either clinical psychologists or a psychiatrist, compared to waiting-list controls. Andersson et al. made this comparison in elderly tinnitus patients and found a statistically significant improvement in TRQ score for their CBT group compared to controls. There were no significant improvements in HADS or Anxiety Severity Index (ASI) scores; in fact, the ASI score increased significantly in their control group. In terms of clinical significance, 42% of CBT participants showed clinical improvement in TRQ, but this reduced to 25% at 3-month follow-up.

Henry and Wilson also reported a statistically significant improvement in TRQ score in their CBT group compared to controls. They found no changes in either BDI or THQ scores. Kröner-Herwig et al. reported a significant improvement in TQ score. In Robinson et al, attrition was 32% in the CBT group, as participants reported that they were not distressed enough or that participation was too demanding on time. Non-completers had experienced tinnitus significantly longer than those who completed the intervention, suggesting that CBT is less indicated in very chronic cases. A power calculation was conducted for this study, but again, because of high attrition, the sample size estimate was not met. Furthermore, as is unforeseeable with full randomization, the intervention group had a significantly higher baseline TRQ than controls, making the groups less comparable. A significant effect was also reported for changes in BDI score in the CBT group compared to controls.

### Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation for treatment of tinnitus: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112rMQq4]. Otology & Neurotology (2020). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the treatment efficacy of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) in patients with tinnitus.

Data sources included searches in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library for the concepts "Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation" and "Tinnitus".

- **Study selection**: Criteria for inclusion were:
1. Double- or single-blinded randomized controlled trials.
2. Double- or single-blinded randomized comparison trials.
3. Prospective or retrospective observational studies.
4. Case series.

Studies were excluded if they were non-English, nonhuman, case reports (n ≤ 5), or review articles.

- **Data extraction** involved collecting information from the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI), the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), and perceived tinnitus suppression after treatment. Additional data collected included tinnitus laterality, duration of symptoms, location of electrode placement, time to follow-up, etiology of tinnitus, and treatment side effects.

- **Data synthesis**: The literature search identified 2,941 unique articles. After reviewing 118 full-text articles, 17 studies reporting on 1,215 patients were included in the final analysis. Four studies provided data for a meta-analysis of pre- and post-treatment THI and VAS scores (Cochrane Review Manager). TENS showed a significant overall reduction in THI scores (-7.55 [-10.93 to -4.18], p < 0.0001) and VAS scores (-0.65 [-0.99 to -0.30], p < 0.0002). The subjective improvement of tinnitus was pooled across 13 studies using meta-analysis of proportions (MedCalc). Tinnitus suppression occurred in 40.0% [28.9–51.7%] of patients, with 22.2% [12.2–29.7%] experiencing complete suppression.

### Cognitive behavioural therapy for tinnitus [^111RJzB3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Tinnitus is an auditory perception that can be described as the experience of sound in the ear or head, in the absence of external acoustic stimulation, which is not usually audible to anyone else. At present, no specific therapy for tinnitus is acknowledged to be satisfactory for all patients. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) uses relaxation, cognitive restructuring of thoughts, and exposure to exacerbating situations to promote habituation and may benefit tinnitus patients, as may the treatment of associated psychological conditions.

- **Objectives**: To assess whether cognitive behavioural therapy is effective in managing patients suffering from tinnitus.

- **Search strategy**: Our search included the Cochrane ENT Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2006), MEDLINE, and EMBASE. The last search date was June 2006.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials in which patients with unilateral or bilateral tinnitus as the main symptom received cognitive behavioural treatment.

- **Data collection and analysis**: One review author assessed every report identified by the search strategy. The four review authors assessed the methodological quality, applied inclusion/exclusion criteria, and extracted data.

- **Main results**: Six trials comprising 285 participants were included.

	- **Primary outcome**: Subjective tinnitus loudness. CBT compared to a waiting list control group showed no significant difference (Standardised Mean Difference (SMD) 0.06 (95% CI -0.25 to 0.37)).

### VA/DoD clinical practice guideline for tinnitus [^113WzB7P]. VA/DoD (2024). High credibility.

The 2024 VA/DoD guidelines address nonpharmacologic interventions for tinnitus, specifically focusing on sound therapy. The guidelines state that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for, or against the use of sound therapy with altered music, such as notched music therapy or spectrally altered music, to reduce the impact of tinnitus.

### Systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials examining tinnitus management [^114kM4AR]. The Laryngoscope (2011). Low credibility.

The aim of tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) is to promote habituation to tinnitus through a combination of sound enrichment and directive counseling. In addition to the study reported earlier (Zachriat and Kröner-Herwig), two further RCTs of TRT were identified, both of which provide low-level evidence. Caffier et al. compared TRT to a waiting-list control, finding a significant reduction in TQ score in their TRT group versus controls at 12 months. Interpreting efficacy is difficult, as TRT was not delivered according to a single protocol but was highly individualized between participants. Variations included the use of prescribed devices and additional treatment for anxiety or depression. Authors indicate that there was more improvement in participants undertaking (as opposed to rejecting) additional treatment for anxiety or depression if it was indicated.

Seydel et al. compared TRT, modified to include psychosomatic treatment, cognitive-behavioral elements, and relaxation treatment, with a waiting-list control. After 3 months of treatment, the mean TQ score was significantly reduced in the TRT group compared to controls. ADS scores, indicating anxiety and depression, also reduced significantly in the TRT group compared to controls. The authors noted greater improvement in individuals with a higher baseline depression score. Follow-up was not well controlled, but the TQ score of the TRT group remained low after 1 year, whereas ADS scores returned to baseline after 6 months. As in Caffier et al, treatment was tailored to individual needs.
