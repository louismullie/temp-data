## Question

Can you have uti with Pyuria but no leukocyte esterase

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a urinary tract infection (UTI) can occur with pyuria but a negative leukocyte esterase on dipstick testing. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions of pyuria and how leukocyte esterase detects it. Then, I should verify the biological and technical reasons for discordance between microscopic pyuria and a negative dipstick. Next, I will review population-specific data on sensitivity and specificity, including children, older adults, and special populations. After that, I should consider pathogen-related factors that blunt pyuria or esterase. Finally, I will synthesize a clinically actionable conclusion and outline practical next steps, including when to trust a negative dipstick and when to pursue culture despite it.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I don't conflate terms. Pyuria refers to an elevated white blood cell count in urine, typically defined as at least 5 white blood cells per high-power field on microscopy or at least 10 white blood cells per microliter in uncentrifuged urine, indicating urinary tract inflammation. Leukocyte esterase is an enzyme released by neutrophils that a dipstick detects as a surrogate for pyuria, but it is semiquantitative and method-dependent, so it does not perfectly mirror microscopic WBC counts.

> Now, I need to check the biological and technical reasons for discordance. Wait, let me verify the main contributors: low WBC enzyme activity in some infections, very dilute urine reducing antigen concentration, short bladder dwell time limiting nitrite formation and potentially esterase detection, and dipstick insensitivity at low WBC densities. Additionally, certain pathogens provoke less inflammation, and dipsticks can be falsely negative when WBCs are present but below the dipstick's detection threshold or when the sample is dilute, which is well documented in pediatric and adult literature [^270eef26] [^0385bc4c] [^e497fdee] [^ee8f930e].

> Next, I should review pediatric data because children often illustrate this problem clearly. Hold on, I should verify the magnitude: in a large cohort of catheterized children with culture-confirmed UTI, about 13% lacked pyuria and about 12–13% had negative leukocyte esterase, with non–E. coli organisms like Enterococcus, Klebsiella, and Pseudomonas disproportionately showing less pyuria and less esterase positivity. This pattern persists even when restricting to catheterized specimens, arguing against contamination as the sole explanation [^e497fdee] [^ee8f930e] [^a73c9fef]. I should double-check sensitivity estimates: in febrile infants, urinalysis sensitivity hovers around 87–94% depending on culture thresholds, reinforcing that a meaningful minority of true UTIs will have negative dipsticks or absent pyuria [^e4bc8ec1] [^7f4330a2].

> Let me consider older adults, where the pretest probability and test performance differ. I need to ensure I don't overgeneralize: in women aged 65 and older, asymptomatic bacteriuria is common and over 90% of those with ASB have pyuria, so using low pyuria thresholds or relying on dipstick positivity inflates false positives. Conversely, a negative dipstick can still be useful to rule out UTI in the right clinical context, though sensitivity is imperfect and population-specific [^0c7e2611] [^78abbe8d]. But wait, what if the patient is symptomatic? Even in symptomatic older adults, dipstick sensitivity for bacteriuria is high but specificity is poor, meaning a positive dipstick is not diagnostic, whereas a negative dipstick can lower the likelihood of UTI but does not absolutely exclude it, especially if symptoms are compelling [^b947645f] [^33829b7b].

> I should confirm special populations where discordance is expected. In catheter-associated settings, guidelines advise not to use pyuria alone to diagnose CA-UTI because colonization and inflammation are common. Thus, pyuria with a negative leukocyte esterase can reflect colonization, low-grade inflammation, or a pathogen that induces minimal pyuria, and diagnosis must integrate symptoms and culture rather than any single urinalysis parameter [^f080f3f8] [^2f0021d3]. In patients with spina bifida or neurogenic bladder, UA performance is modest and pyuria thresholds perform poorly, so a negative dipstick should not reassure if clinical suspicion is high [^0b0813b7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about test performance without anchoring to the clinical context. I should double-check the negative predictive value claims: in many outpatient and ED settings, a negative dipstick for leukocyte esterase and nitrite substantially reduces the probability of UTI, with negative likelihood ratios around 0.2, which is clinically useful when pretest probability is low to moderate. However, in high-risk groups or when symptoms are classic, a negative dipstick cannot safely exclude UTI and culture is warranted [^ecb7a8a4] [^c3e937dd] [^f36c2ed5]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the NPV could reach 98% broadly, but I should correct that: while some cohorts show high NPV for a negative screen, performance varies by population and prevalence, so I need to be cautious in extrapolating those figures to all patients [^7fac21e8] [^3ce94708].

> Let me synthesize the answer clearly. Yes, a UTI can occur with pyuria on microscopy but a negative leukocyte esterase on dipstick, and this discordance is well documented across ages and populations. The reasons include pathogen-related blunting of the inflammatory response, low WBC density near the dipstick detection threshold, dilute urine, and technical limitations of dipsticks, so a negative leukocyte esterase does not exclude UTI when clinical suspicion is significant [^e497fdee] [^ee8f930e] [^270eef26] [^7f32f8c6].

> I need to ensure the clinical implications are actionable. If symptoms are suggestive or the patient is high risk, I should obtain a urine culture and consider microscopy rather than relying on dipstick alone. In children, guidelines endorse culture when suspicion is high even with a negative urinalysis, and in older adults, stewardship frameworks emphasize not treating based on urinalysis alone and focusing on symptomatic patients with supportive labs [^f36c2ed5] [^e15c3cdc] [^c89f0cc7]. Conversely, if symptoms are mild and pretest probability is low, a negative dipstick can support observation, but I should document the rationale and arrange follow-up if symptoms persist or evolve [^ecb7a8a4] [^c3e937dd].

> Finally, I should confirm practical next steps when discordance appears. If pyuria is present on microscopy but leukocyte esterase is negative, I should verify specimen quality, consider repeating the urinalysis on a first-morning or more concentrated sample, and send a culture with susceptibilities. If the patient is symptomatic and the stakes are high, I should not delay appropriate empiric therapy while awaiting culture, especially in infants, immunocompromised hosts, or those with systemic features [^f36c2ed5] [^d7b1c68e] [^375810f9].

In sum, **yes, a UTI can present with pyuria but a negative leukocyte esterase** [^e497fdee] because dipsticks are less sensitive than microscopy and can miss low-level pyuria or WBCs with low enzymatic activity [^df2ee782]. This is more likely with dilute urine, certain pathogens (e.g. Enterococcus, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas) [^e497fdee], or early infection. If clinical suspicion is high, **confirm with microscopy and culture** [^33829b7b]; a negative dipstick does not exclude UTI [^f36c2ed5].

---

## Definitions and diagnostic criteria

- **Pyuria**: ≥ 5 WBCs/hpf on microscopy or ≥ 10 WBCs/mm³ in uncentrifuged urine [^a0aaf861].
- **Leukocyte esterase**: a dipstick surrogate for pyuria, but less sensitive than microscopy [^71ae27e8].
- **UTI diagnosis**: combines symptoms with significant bacteriuria and pyuria; absence of pyuria makes UTI unlikely but does not exclude it [^55b5409c] [^a044c86c].

## Mechanisms explaining pyuria with negative leukocyte esterase

Several factors can explain **pyuria with a negative leukocyte esterase**:

| **Mechanism** | **Explanation** |
|-|-|
| Low WBC concentration | Dipsticks may miss pyuria when WBCs are below detection limits [^71ae27e8] |
| Dilute urine | Low specific gravity reduces dipstick sensitivity [^270eef26] |
| Pathogen-related factors | Some organisms (e.g. Enterococcus, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas) cause less inflammation and lower esterase activity [^e497fdee] [^ed5a14d1] |
| Early infection | Pyuria may precede detectable esterase activity [^notfound] |
| Technical limitations | Dipsticks are less sensitive than microscopy [^71ae27e8] |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting this phenomenon

Multiple studies document **UTI with pyuria but negative leukocyte esterase**:

- **Pediatric studies**: 13% of culture-confirmed UTIs lacked pyuria; non-E. coli pathogens were less likely to show pyuria or positive esterase [^e497fdee] [^ee8f930e].
- **Adult studies**: In urologic outpatients, leukocyte esterase sensitivity was only 56–59%, and microscopy was 66% vs culture [^1c35ae21].
- **Systematic reviews**: Rapid tests (dipstick/microscopy) are negative in ~10% of UTIs; microscopy for bacteria is more accurate than WBCs or dipstick alone [^71ae27e8] [^b5df92e7].

---

## Clinical implications and diagnostic approach

- **Clinical context**: Interpret urinalysis alongside symptoms and risk factors; a negative dipstick does not exclude UTI [^f36c2ed5].
- **Confirmatory testing**: Use microscopy and culture when suspicion is high, especially in children, older adults, or complicated cases [^33829b7b] [^d7b1c68e].
- **Population-specific considerations**: Older adults have high ASB prevalence; pyuria alone is not diagnostic and can misclassify ASB as UTI [^0c7e2611] [^78abbe8d].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

UTI can occur with **pyuria but negative leukocyte esterase** due to low WBC levels, dilute urine, pathogen factors, or early infection. Dipsticks are useful for screening but have limited sensitivity; confirm with microscopy and culture when clinical suspicion persists [^71ae27e8] [^33829b7b].

### Current pyuria cutoffs promote inappropriate urinary tract infection diagnosis in older women [^0c7e2611]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) incidence increases with age and is higher in women than in men. In older women, diagnosing UTI is complicated for several reasons. First, symptom communication may be affected by cognitive impairment. Second, pre-existing lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), such as urinary incontinence and urgency, are common and distinguishing acute from chronic LUTS can be challenging. Finally, 20% of community-dwelling and 50% of institutionalized older women have asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB), defined as the presence of 1 or more uropathogens with 10⁵ colony-forming units (CFU)/mL or higher in the absence of signs or symptoms attributable to UTI. As a result, inappropriate antimicrobial treatment is common, leading to unnecessary side effects, drug interactions, Clostridioides difficile infection, and the selection of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. Distinguishing ASB from UTI is further complicated by the fact that over 90% of older women with ASB have concomitant pyuria. Consequently, the positive-predictive value of the presence of pyuria for UTI is low in older women. However, it is unclear whether the degree of pyuria differs between older women with UTI and ASB, partly because urine dipstick is the most ordered screening test, providing only semiquantitative results of leukocyte esterase activity. Pyuria can be quantified in different ways. Initially, Mabeck found that a leukocyte excretion rate of 400 000 per hour could distinguish UTI from asymptomatic women. This rate corresponds to a cutoff value of 10 leukocytes/mm³ in non-centrifuged urine. In clinical practice and research, pyuria is most often quantified by direct or automated microscopy of (non)centrifuged urine, usually after initial dipstick screening. Automated microscopy reduces variability in centrifugation and resuspension of urine and is more efficient than direct microscopy. In recent years, an increasing number of laboratories are adopting urine flowcytometry for quantification of pyuria. Although cutoff values for "significant" pyuria vary in the literature and depend on quantification methods, commonly accepted cutoffs include 10 leukocytes/µL and 5–10 leukocytes per high-power field (hpf). These cutoff values are largely derived from studies involving nonpregnant premenopausal women, in whom ASB is uncommon. The objective of this study was to determine sensitivity and specificity of automated microscopy and urine flowcytometry for diagnosing UTI in older women, with the ultimate goal to derive optimal cutoff values for pyuria for UTI in this population, taking ASB into account.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^33829b7b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Urinalysis with reflex-to-culture algorithms — pyuria thresholds and exceptions indicate there is no single laboratory parameter or combination of parameters that can sufficiently predict whether the patient has a urinary tract infection or if bacteria will be recovered in culture, and that pyuria alone is likely the best marker in terms of negative predictive value, with leukocyte esterase or white blood cells (WBCs) increasing the likelihood of a positive culture, although detection methods have not been standardized. Although > 10 WBCs per low power field is a commonly adopted threshold for a urinalysis with reflex to culture (UARC) algorithm, this threshold cannot be effectively applied to all patient groups, and exceptions are recommended for patients who are pregnant and for patients with urologic abnormalities or undergoing urologic procedures. Laboratory algorithms should take into account local patient populations and should be guided by both clinicians and laboratorians, and in older adults with mental status changes or other signs classically localizing UTI symptoms, bacteriuria may be unrelated and a thoughtful approach should be taken before interpretations are made.

### Current pyuria cutoffs promote inappropriate urinary tract infection diagnosis in older women [^78abbe8d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Implications

In asymptomatic controls, median urine leukocyte values were higher than the most commonly used cutoff value of 10 leukocytes/µL. Therefore, applying the current pyuria threshold to older women leads to misclassification of many of these women, both with and without ASB. This has several consequences. First, the true cause of the symptoms (eg, vaginal atrophy, Candida vulvovaginitis, and overactive bladder) remains unidentified and thus untreated if symptoms are wrongfully attributed to UTI. Second, it leads to overprescription of antimicrobials, contributing to gut dysbiosis, side effects, and selection of resistant pathogens. Gupta et al show that 25% of asymptomatic patients with pyuria on routine preoperative urinalysis (without urine cultures) were treated with antimicrobials, and that the degree of pyuria predicted prescribing of antimicrobials. These findings, combined with our own data, imply that separate, higher reference values are needed for older women with regard to pyuria. For instance, a threshold of 300 leukocytes/µL would be a considerable improvement, increasing specificity to avoid overtreatment while still maintaining a fair sensitivity. As in any diagnostic test, pyuria levels should be interpreted within the clinical context of individual patients and should not be the only deciding factor when diagnosing UTI. Since both older women with UTI and asymptomatic older women have a high pre-test probability of pyuria, and leukocyte esterase activity is a very rough estimate of the absolute number of leukocytes in the urine, the role of urine dipsticks in older patients should, at best, be limited to ruling out UTI. In addition to clinical implications, there are also implications for research, as misclassification influences the validity of UTI studies.

Strengths and Limitations

Strengths of our study include the use of a stringent UTI definition instead of urine culture as a reference standard, the consistency of results across 2 quantification methods (identical AUCs), inclusion of participants from multiple settings, and the rapid analysis of urine samples, increasing the reliability of results. Our study also has several limitations. Results may not be generalizable to institutionalized older people with high frailty and/or advanced dementia. However, our population was chosen to prove a concept for which a clear definition and reliable assessment of UTI and ASB were deemed necessary. Moreover, our control group contained a higher proportion of LTCF residents than our UTI group. Nonetheless, ADL dependency scores were similar between the UTI and control groups, and median leukocyte values within the LTCF subgroup were comparable to the values of the overall group.

### Urinary tract infection in children [^b04c4cae]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Up to 7 percent of girls and 2 percent of boys will have a symptomatic, culture-confirmed urinary tract infection by six years of age. Urinary tract infection may be suspected because of urinary symptoms in older children or because of fever, nonspecific symptoms, or failure to thrive in infants. Urine dipstick analysis is useful for ruling out urinary tract infections in cases with low clinical suspicion. However, urine culture is necessary for diagnosis of urinary tract infections in children if there is high clinical suspicion, cloudy urine, or if urine dipstick testing shows positive leukocyte esterase or nitrite activity. Despite current recommendations, routine imaging studies (e.g., renal ultrasonography, voiding cystourethrography, renal scans) do not appear to improve clinical outcomes in uncomplicated urinary tract infections. Oral antibiotics are as effective as parenteral therapy in randomized trials. The optimal duration of antibiotic therapy has not been established, but one-day therapies have been shown to be inferior to longer treatment courses.

AAP urinary tract infection (UTI) guideline — diagnostic thresholds and pyuria: For urine obtained by catheterization, 50 000 cfu/ml was proposed as the appropriate threshold; lower colony counts are sufficient if obtained by SPA, and most (80%) cases of UTI documented with urine obtained by SPA have 10⁵ cfu/ mL or more. Colony counts lower than 50 000 cfu/mL are currently being considered for the diagnosis of UTI if 10 000 cfu/ml is coupled with symptoms (eg, fever) and evidence of inflammation (pyuria), and significant pyuria is ≥ 10 white blood cells/mm3 on an "enhanced urinalysis" or ≥ 5 white blood cells per high power field on a centrifuged specimen of urine or any leukocyte esterase on a dipstick.

### Sterile pyuria in patients admitted to the hospital with infections outside of the urinary tract [^32c481b5]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objective of this study was to determine the incidence, associations, evaluation, and management of pyuria in patients admitted to the hospital with nonurinary infections.

Methods

This study abstracted inpatient records of consecutive patients hospitalized for pneumonia, intra-abdominal infections, female genital tract infections (GYN infections), bacterial septicemia, and enteritis in the pediatric and adult medical and surgical units at an academic medical center.

Results

The study population included 210 patients (66 children; 144 adults). Nearly one-third had ≥ 5 white blood cells (WBCs) per high-power field (pyuria). Pyuria was more common in women (P < .001) and in patients with GYN infections (P = 0.001) and less common in patients with pneumonia (P < .001). Cultures were performed on 18 of 19 children (94.7%) and 26 of 43 adults (60.5%) with pyuria. Of those, 11.1% of children and 42.1% of adults had a positive culture, and all but one of those met criteria for a urinary tract infection. Excluding patients with GYN infections, only 18.8% of patients with pyuria had a positive culture. Of the 44 patients with pyuria who were cultured, a positive culture was associated with having a GYN infection (P = 0.01), moderate or large amounts of bacteria in the urine (P = 0.005), and a positive urine nitrite (P = 0.004). The absolute number of WBCs or red blood cells in the urine and the presence of casts, proteinuria, and leukocyte esterase were not associated with positive culture or urinary tract infection. Neither pyuria nor a positive culture was related to temperature, systemic WBC count, or serum albumin, blood urea nitrogen, or creatinine.

Conclusions

Sterile pyuria of uncertain cause is common in patients admitted to the hospital with acute nonurinary infections.

### A revalidation and critique of assumptions about urinary sample collection methods, specimen quality and contamination [^72221365]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A urinary tract infection (UTI) is the leading reason why patients seek treatment in primary care. One in three women will be treated with antibiotics for UTI by the age of 24 and 40% to 50% of women will experience one or more UTIs in their lifetime, with 10–15% experiencing recurrent infections. A UTI is commonly identified among young adolescents attending sexual health centres and accounts for 17% of treatment cases. In the adult population of 65 years and older, a UTI is the second most common cause of infectious disease related to hospitalisations in the USA. A UTI is a debilitating condition causing the onset of painful urination (dysuria), increased urinary frequency, the inability to start urinating (hesitancy) and the sensation of a sudden need to urinate (urgency), all of which are classified as lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).

Many clinical guidelines advocate urinary dipstick testing for leucocyte esterase and nitrite as a means of detecting UTI, but evidence suggests that their utility might be limited. Dipstick analyses are surrogate tests, referenced not to microscopic pyuria but to a gold standard urine culture threshold for UTI, which guidelines accept as being between 10³ cfu mL⁻¹ and 10⁶ cfu mL⁻¹ of the pure growth of a single urinary pathogen. This test has attracted criticism too. Furthermore, the literature shows that the methods of sample collection for urine culture have never been validated in appropriate clinical trials. Justification for the use of such methods is based on plausible assumptions without supporting evidence. It is now recognised that routine urinalyses, including dipstick and culture, are insensitive, thus missing genuine infection in many symptomatic patients.

### History and physical examination plus laboratory testing for the diagnosis of adult female urinary tract infection [^ecb7a8a4]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Emergency physicians often encounter females presenting with symptoms suggestive of urinary tract infections (UTIs). The diagnostic accuracy of history, physical examination, and bedside laboratory tests for female UTIs in emergency departments (EDs) have not been quantitatively described.

Objectives

This was a systematic review to determine the utility of history and physical examination (H&P) and urinalysis in diagnosing uncomplicated female UTI in the ED.

Methods

The medical literature was searched from January 1965 through October 2012 in PUBMED and EMBASE using the following criteria: Patients were females greater than 18 years of age in the ED suspected of having UTIs. Interventions were H&P and urinalysis used to diagnose a UTI. The comparator was UTI confirmed by a positive urine culture. The outcome was operating characteristics of the interventions in diagnosing a UTI. Study quality was assessed using Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2). Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs) were calculated using Meta-DiSc.

Results

Four studies (pooled n = 948) were included with UTI prevalence ranging from 40% to 60%. H&P variables all had positive LRs (+LR, range = 0.8 to 2.2) and negative LRs (-LR, range = 0.7 to 1.0) that are insufficient to significantly alter pretest probability of UTI. Only a positive nitrite reaction (+LR = 7.5 to 24.5) was useful to rule in a UTI. To rule out UTI, only a negative leukocyte esterase (LE; -LR = 0.2) or blood reaction on urine dipstick (-LR = 0.2) were significantly accurate. Increasing pyuria directly correlated with +LR, and moderate pyuria (urine white blood cells [uWBC] > 50 colony-forming units [CFUs]/ml) and moderate bacteruria were good predictors of UTI (+LR = 6.4 and 15.0, respectively).

Conclusions

No single H&P finding can accurately rule in or rule out UTI in symptomatic women. Urinalysis with a positive nitrite or moderate pyuria and/or bacteruria are accurate predictors of a UTI. If the pretest probability of UTI is sufficiently low, a negative urinalysis can accurately rule out the diagnosis.

Urinary tract infection diagnostic testing recommendations alignment — The level B recommendation about the use of diagnostic tests (eg, leukocyte esterase, nitrites, leukocyte count, Gram's stain) for a preliminary diagnosis of urinary tract infection and the level C recommendation that a urine culture should be obtained when urinary tract infection is suspected even with a negative urinalysis result are consistent with the AAP guideline, and the AAP guideline further recommends that the specimen be obtained through catheterization or suprapubic aspirate.

### High risk and low prevalence diseases: infected urolithiasis [^1987e623]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Infected urolithiasis is a serious condition that carries with it a high rate of morbidity and mortality.

Objective

This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of infected urolithiasis, including presentation, diagnosis, and management in the emergency department based on current evidence.

Discussion

Although urolithiasis is common and the vast majority can be treated conservatively, the presence of a concomitant urinary tract infection significantly increases the risk of morbidity, to include sepsis and mortality. Identification of infected urolithiasis can be challenging as patients may have symptoms similar to uncomplicated urolithiasis and/or pyelonephritis. However, clinicians should consider infected urolithiasis in toxic-appearing patients with fever, chills, dysuria, and costovertebral angle tenderness, especially in those with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections. Positive urine leukocyte esterase, nitrites, and pyuria in conjunction with an elevated white blood cell count may be helpful to identify infected urolithiasis. Patients should be resuscitated with fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Additionally, computed tomography and early urology consultation are recommended to facilitate definitive care.

Conclusions

An understanding of infected urolithiasis can assist emergency clinicians in diagnosing and managing this potentially deadly disease.

### Urinalysis: a comprehensive review [^ff676142]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

A complete urinalysis includes physical, chemical, and microscopic examinations. Midstream clean collection is acceptable in most situations, but the specimen should be examined within two hours of collection. Cloudy urine often is a result of precipitated phosphate crystals in alkaline urine, but pyuria also can be the cause. A strong odor may be the result of a concentrated specimen rather than a urinary tract infection. Dipstick urinalysis is convenient, but false-positive and false-negative results can occur. Specific gravity provides a reliable assessment of the patient's hydration status. Microhematuria has a range of causes, from benign to life threatening. Glomerular, renal, and urologic causes of microhematuria often can be differentiated by other elements of the urinalysis. Although transient proteinuria typically is a benign condition, persistent proteinuria requires further work-up. Uncomplicated urinary tract infections diagnosed by positive leukocyte esterase and nitrite tests can be treated without culture.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^1161ac28]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — urinalysis for pyuria: Urinalysis in women with rUTI can confirm pyuria described as at least 10 white blood cells per high-power field, though interpretation remains debatable; when the finding of pyuria would alter the treatment plan, the clinician should obtain a urinalysis.

### Urinary tract infections in older women: a clinical review [^7ba03373]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Asymptomatic bacteriuria and symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs) in older women are commonly encountered in outpatient practice.

Objective

To review management of asymptomatic bacteriuria and symptomatic UTI and review prevention of recurrent UTIs in older community-dwelling women.

Evidence Review

A search of Ovid (Medline, PsycINFO, Embase) for English-language human studies conducted among adults aged 65 years and older and published in peer-reviewed journals from 1946 to November 20, 2013.

Results

The clinical spectrum of UTIs ranges from asymptomatic bacteriuria, to symptomatic and recurrent UTIs, to sepsis associated with UTI requiring hospitalization. Recent evidence helps differentiate asymptomatic bacteriuria from symptomatic UTI. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is transient in older women, often resolves without any treatment, and is not associated with morbidity or mortality. The diagnosis of symptomatic UTI is made when a patient has both clinical features and laboratory evidence of a urinary infection. Absent other causes, patients presenting with any 2 of the following meet the clinical diagnostic criteria for symptomatic UTI: fever, worsened urinary urgency or frequency, acute dysuria, suprapubic tenderness, or costovertebral angle pain or tenderness. A positive urine culture (≥ 10⁵ CFU/mL) with no more than 2 uropathogens and pyuria confirms the diagnosis of UTI. Risk factors for recurrent symptomatic UTI include diabetes, functional disability, recent sexual intercourse, prior history of urogynecologic surgery, urinary retention, and urinary incontinence. Testing for UTI is easily performed in the clinic using dipstick tests. When there is a low pretest probability of UTI, a negative dipstick result for leukocyte esterase and nitrites excludes infection. Antibiotics are selected by identifying the uropathogen, knowing local resistance rates, and considering adverse effect profiles. Chronic suppressive antibiotics for 6 to 12 months and vaginal estrogen therapy effectively reduce symptomatic UTI episodes and should be considered in patients with recurrent UTIs.

Conclusions and Relevance

Establishing a diagnosis of symptomatic UTI in older women requires careful clinical evaluation with possible laboratory assessment using urinalysis and urine culture. Asymptomatic bacteriuria should be differentiated from symptomatic UTI. Asymptomatic bacteriuria in older women should not be treated.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^0385bc4c]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Urine dipstick tests (nitrite and leukocyte esterase) — Dipstick assays detect leukocyte esterase (LE) and urinary nitrite, and bacterial conversion of dietary nitrates to nitrites requires approximately 4 hours in the bladder; because infants void frequently, a nitrite test is not sensitive and negative results have little value in ruling out urinary tract infection (UTI), although a positive nitrite is highly specific. In clinically suspected UTI, LE sensitivity is 94%, with overall reported sensitivity 83% and specificity average 72% (range: 64%–92%); positive LE results should be interpreted with caution because false-positive results are common and pyuria is nonspecific.

Well-appearing febrile infants and children aged 2 months to 2 years — laboratory testing for urinary tract infection: Level A recommendations are none specified. Level B recommendations state that physicians can use a positive test result for any one of urine leukocyte esterase, nitrites, leukocyte count, or Gram's stain to make a preliminary diagnosis of urinary tract infection in febrile patients aged 2 months to 2 years. Level C recommendations state that physicians should obtain a urine culture when starting antibiotics for the preliminary diagnosis of urinary tract infection in febrile patients aged 2 months to 2 years, and that in those with a negative dipstick urinalysis result in whom urinary tract infection is still suspected, obtain a urine culture.

Who needs evaluation for UTI

Clinical diagnosis of UTI is unreliable, so many children with fever or symptoms of UTI need a urine sample to exclude or make the diagnosis. Urine samples should be collected before starting antibiotics, but therapy should not be delayed in the septic child.

Children with localising signs or suspected UTI need a urine sample to confirm the diagnosis.

Children with fever without focus, particularly neonates and infants, need a urine sample to evaluate potential UTI. Outside early infancy and if the child is not unwell, it may be reasonable to wait 24 hours for collection to see if an alternative focus emerges.

Children with an alternative focus of illness generally do not need a urine sample. Exceptions are septic infants, children with predisposing conditions (eg, renal anomalies), children at risk of complications (eg, single kidney) and febrile illness not following the expected clinical course.

Screening – dipstick and microscopy

Urine dipsticks are a quick, inexpensive bedside screening tool. Chemical reagent strips change colour in the presence of leucocyte esterase (an enzyme present in leucocytes) and nitrites, which may arise from UTI. Leucocytes generally appear in the urine in response to UTI. However, sterile pyuria can occur with other infections. Enterococcus, Klebsiella and Pseudomonas species are also less likely to produce pyuria than E.coli in children with symptomatic UTI. Most uropathogens convert dietary nitrates into urinary nitrites. However, not all do, including Enterococcus and Klebsiella species. Dipsticks are also less reliable in young infants, where frequent voiding flushes substrates out of the bladder.

Neither leucocytes or nitrites are fully sensitive or specific for UTI, but they are a useful screening test, particularly when used in combination. If UTI is thought unlikely, dipsticks have a good negative predictive value to exclude the diagnosis. In the presence of suggestive symptoms and either leucocytes or nitrites, empirical antibiotics while awaiting culture is indicated.

Urine microscopy also identifies leucocytes and bacteria, augmenting dipstick screening.

### The importance of pyuria in identifying a UTI needs more "Concentration" If you want to use this sign as a diagnostic tool… [^4412a52e]. publications.aap.org (2016). Low credibility.

When we find white blood cells being reported in a urinalysis, we tend to look at the number of white cells among other clinical indicators to point us in the direction of diagnosing a urinary tract infection. Yet with newer automated urinalysis systems that do not centrifuge urines, it is possible that urine concentration may need to be taken into account in terms of how many white cells per high powered field are suggestive of that UTI. In other words, do you need to see more WBC if the sample is obtained from concentrated urine and less WBCs in less concentrated urine. To answer this question Chaudari et al. in a study being released this month in our journal, performed a retrospective cross-sectional study of 2700 infants less than 3 months of age being evaluated for a possible UTI. WBC and leukocyte esterase levels were looked at in terms of specific gravities of urines ≥ 1. 015 and less than 1.
015.

Optimal WBC cut points were obtained depending on whether the urine was dilute or more concentrated whereas concentration did not influence leukocyte esterase positivity at all. Do you take into account the urine concentration when you send a urine to your lab to be analyzed. Is this a useful clinical finding to apply. To help you make that decision, we have asked the chair of the AAP's UTI policy committee, Dr. Ken Roberts to share his thoughts on this study with an accompanying commentary that is a must-read as well. Take a pee-k at both the study and commentary and let us know your thoughts by responding to this blog, sending us a comment to be posted with this article or post your thoughts on our Facebook or Twitter sites.

### Urinary tract infections in pregnant individuals [^dfb8de71]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Acute cystitis diagnosis in pregnant individuals — clinicians should evaluate patients with symptoms of acute cystitis with a urine culture; urinary tract infection should be suspected based on the presence of symptoms, may be supported by a positive urinalysis result, and is confirmed by urine culture showing 100,000 CFU/mL or more. Pyuria, defined as more than 5 white blood cells/high-power field or presence of leukocyte esterase, has up to 97% sensitivity for UTI; nitrites are the most specific finding (94–98%), and if neither nitrites nor leukocyte esterase are present, UTI is unlikely (negative predictive value 78–98%).

### Association between uropathogen and pyuria [^e497fdee]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to determine factors associated with the absence of pyuria in symptomatic children whose urine culture was positive for a known uropathogen.

Methods

We obtained data on children evaluated at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh emergency department between 2007 and 2013 with symptoms of urinary tract infection (UTI) who had paired urinalysis and urine cultures. We excluded children with an unknown or bag urine collection method, major genitourinary anomalies, immunocompromising conditions, or with multiple organisms on culture. We chose a single, randomly-selected urine specimen per child and limited the analysis to those with positive cultures.

Results

There were 46158 visits during the study period; 1181 children diagnosed with UTI met all inclusion criteria and had a microscopic urinalysis for pyuria. Pyuria (≥ 5 white blood cells per high-powered field or ≥ 10 white blood cells per cubic millimeter) was present in 1031 (87%) children and absent in 150 (13%). Children with Enterococcus species, Klebsiella species, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were significantly less likely to exhibit pyuria than children with Escherichia coli (odds ratio of 0.14, 0.34, and 0.19, respectively). Children with these organisms were also less likely to have a positive leukocyte esterase on dipstick urinalysis. Results were similar when we restricted the analysis to children whose urine samples were collected by bladder catheterization.

Conclusions

We found that certain uropathogens are less likely to be associated with pyuria in symptomatic children. Identification of biomarkers more accurate than pyuria or leukocyte esterase may help reduce over- and undertreatment of UTIs.

### Current pyuria cutoffs promote inappropriate urinary tract infection diagnosis in older women [^c98d012b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

METHODS

This study is an exploratory analysis of an overarching, case-control study registered at the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (NL9477). The study was conducted across 5 hospitals (4 regional and 1 academic), 4 long-term care facilities (LTCFs), 3 primary care centers, 1 after-hours primary care clinic, and 14 senior housing facilities. This study was approved by the regional medical ethics committee (Medisch-Ethische Toetsingscommissie Leiden Den Haag Delft) and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Study Population

Women aged 65 years and older were eligible for inclusion. Exclusion criteria included inability to express symptoms (eg, due to delirium or cognitive impairment), the presence of an indwelling catheter, immunosuppressive use, antimicrobial use (< 48 hours prior to inclusion), current urolithiasis, and a UTI in the previous month. Stringent criteria were applied to both patients with UTI and control patients, as a consensus-based reference standard for UTI is currently missing. To be eligible for the UTI group, patients were required to have at least 2 new-onset LUTS (dysuria, frequency, urgency, or suprapubic pain). Furthermore, patients were required to have pyuria, defined as 10 or more leukocytes/µL or 5 or more leukocytes/hpf or the presence of leukocyte esterase, and a monoculture (ie, 1 uropathogen ≥ 10⁴ CFU/mL), for the primary analysis. Enterobacterales, enterococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and group B streptococci were considered uropathogens. In case of a temperature of 38.0°C or higher, patients were classified as having an upper UTI. Community-dwelling women and LTCF residents who did not have any LUTS or fever were eligible as controls. Patients were eligible regardless of urine culture results and they were subdivided into 3 subgroups: ASB, negative culture, and mixed flora. Asymptomatic bacteriuria was defined as at least 2 consecutive urine cultures (2–4 weeks apart) with the same uropathogen with 10⁵ CFU/mL or greater, and a negative culture was defined as no growth or growth of nonpathogenic micro-organisms with 10³ CFU/mL or less. Cases and controls were not matched for age or comorbidities.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^d0fc31ab]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Future directions for recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — the guideline highlights that A better understanding of rUTI pathophysiology will greatly aid in our ability to design more effective, mechanistically-based treatments, that Relying on results from the urinary dipstick test, including leukocyte esterase and nitrate, lacks the necessary level of sensitivity and specificity for diagnostic accuracy, and that Currently, there are no symptoms that are definitively predictive of acute cystitis, and no good quality evidence that can support a specific pathogen. It states Urine culture results or any other current methods of bacterial detection do not reflect any aspect of the host response and calls for defining initiatives for algorithms to predict treatment and partnering with our primary care colleagues and patients to provide education regarding rUTI definitions, evaluation, and treatment. It notes Advanced molecular technologies give a more complete characterization of genitourinary microbes and that PCR and NGS-based diagnostic tests have some enticing preliminary studies suggesting their utilization may facilitate equivalent or even better clinical outcomes than standard urine culture while decreasing the time to diagnosis and reducing empiric antibiotic prescriptions, while cautioning These early studies, however, are complicated by some methodological limitations and a high risk of bias and More data are needed before identifying what role these tests play in UTI diagnostics.

### Urinary tract infections in children: EAU / ESPU guidelines [^d7b1c68e]. European Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Context

In 30% of children with urinary tract anomalies, urinary tract infection (UTI) can be the first sign. Failure to identify patients at risk can result in damage to the upper urinary tract.

Objective

To provide recommendations for the diagnosis, treatment, and imaging of children presenting with UTI.

Evidence Acquisition

The recommendations were developed after a review of the literature and a search of PubMed and Embase. A consensus decision was adopted when evidence was low.

Evidence Synthesis

UTIs are classified according to site, episode, symptoms, and complicating factors. For acute treatment, site and severity are the most important. Urine sampling by suprapubic aspiration or catheterisation has a low contamination rate and confirms UTI. Using a plastic bag to collect urine, a UTI can only be excluded if the dipstick is negative for both leukocyte esterase and nitrite or microscopic analysis is negative for both pyuria and bacteriuria. A clean voided midstream urine sample after cleaning the external genitalia has good diagnostic accuracy in toilet-trained children. In children with febrile UTI, antibiotic treatment should be initiated as soon as possible to eradicate infection, prevent bacteraemia, improve outcome, and reduce the likelihood of renal involvement. Ultrasound of the urinary tract is advised to exclude obstructive uropathy. Depending on sex, age, and clinical presentation, vesicoureteral reflux should be excluded. Antibacterial prophylaxis is beneficial. In toilet-trained children, bladder and bowel dysfunction needs to be excluded.

Conclusions

The level of evidence is high for the diagnosis of UTI and treatment in children but not for imaging to identify patients at risk for upper urinary tract damage.

Patient Summary

In these guidelines, we looked at the diagnosis, treatment, and imaging of children with urinary tract infection. There are strong recommendations on diagnosis and treatment; we also advise exclusion of obstructive uropathy within 24h and later vesicoureteral reflux, if indicated.

### Pyuria and urine concentration for identifying urinary tract infection in young children [^7f32f8c6]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Accuracy of pyuria for urinary tract infection (UTI) varies with urine concentration. Our objective of this study was to determine the optimal white blood cell (WBC) cutoff for UTI in young children at different urine concentrations as measured by urine specific gravity.

Methods

Retrospective cross-sectional study of children < 24 months of age evaluated in the emergency department for suspected UTI with paired urinalysis and urine culture during a 6-year period. The primary outcome was positive urine culture result as described in the American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline culture thresholds. Test characteristics for microscopic pyuria cut points and positive leukocyte esterase (LE) were calculated across 3 urine specific gravity groups: low < 1.011, moderate 1.011 to 1.020, and high > 1.020.

Results

Of the total 24171 patients analyzed, urine culture result was positive in 2003 (8.3%). Urine was obtained by transurethral in-and-out catheterization in 97.9%. Optimal WBC cutoffs per high-power field (HPF) were 3 (positive likelihood ratio [LR+] 10.5; negative likelihood ratio [LR-] 0.12) at low, 6 (LR+ 12; LR- 0.14) at moderate, and 8 (LR+ 11.1; LR- 0.35) at high urine concentrations. Likelihood ratios for small positive LE from low to high urine concentrations (LR+ 25.2, LR- 0.12; LR+ 33.1, LR- 0.15; LR+ 37.6, LR- 0.41) remained excellent.

Conclusions

Optimal pyuria cut point in predicting positive urine culture results changes with urine concentration in young children. Pyuria thresholds of 3 WBCs per HPF at low urine concentrations whereas 8 WBCs per HPF at high urine concentrations have optimal predictive value for UTI. Positive LE is a strong predictor of UTI regardless of urine concentration.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^4d0bc8ed]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Urinalysis performance and interpretation in recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) — A negative urinalysis (i.e., negative nitrites and < 5 WBC/hpf) is useful in ruling out acute cystitis and is associated with a very low risk of progression to bacteremia; in a study of more than 12,000 urinalyses, a negative urinalysis showed high predictive accuracy for absence of clinically relevant UTI with specificity 92.2% and positive predictive value (PPV) 97.4%, and stewardship programs that reflex culture only after a positive urinalysis are estimated to reduce inappropriate antibiotics by five-fold; by contrast, positive leukocyte esterase (≥ 1+), pyuria (≥ 10 WBC/hpf), nitrite (≥ 1+), and bacteriuria (≥ 50 cells/field) all have PPVs for UTI lower than 50%, and discordance such as urine culture with > 100,000 CFU/mL E. coli but absent urine nitrites may reflect sampling or handling issues, where identifying epithelial cells or mucus can suggest contamination and obtaining a catheterized specimen may be reasonable; overall, urinalysis is specifically helpful due to its high negative predictive value, but positive findings should not be interpreted as evidence of a clinically significant UTI.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^f36c2ed5]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnostic approach in febrile infants — If a clinician assesses a febrile infant with no apparent source for the fever as not being so ill as to require immediate antimicrobial therapy, then the clinician should assess the likelihood of UTI. If the clinician determines the febrile infant to have a low likelihood of UTI, then clinical follow-up monitoring without testing is sufficient (evidence quality: A; strong recommendation). If the infant is not in a low-risk group, there are 2 choices (evidence quality: A; strong recommendation): obtain a urine specimen through catheterization or suprapubic aspiration (SPA) for culture and urinalysis, or obtain a urine specimen through the most convenient means and perform a urinalysis; if the urinalysis suggests a UTI (positive leukocyte esterase test results or nitrite test or microscopic analysis results positive for leukocytes or bacteria), then a urine specimen should be obtained through catheterization or SPA and cultured; if urinalysis of fresh (< 1 hour since void) urine yields negative leukocyte esterase and nitrite test results, then it is reasonable to monitor the clinical course without initiating antimicrobial therapy, recognizing that negative urinalysis results do not rule out a UTI with certainty.

Which Investigations Are Needed at Diagnosis and During Complicated UTI?

Patient history and clinical review underpin the diagnosis of UTI and assessment of complicating features at presentation (GRADE D).
Urine collection should be done by clean catch, catheterization or suprapubic aspiration and urine analysis, culture and susceptibility testing should be undertaken for all children (GRADE C).
Additional blood investigations for cUTI may include inflammatory markers, full blood count, blood culture, urea, creatinine and electrolytes (GRADE C).
An acute ultrasound scan is helpful in some clinical situations (GRADE D).
All children with cUTI should be reassessed for treatment response at 48 hours. If progress is atypical, consider complications and/or differential diagnosis (GRADE D).
Repeat urine testing is only needed if there is inadequate treatment response (GRADE D).

All children, irrespective of uUTI or cUTI, need urinary investigations to confirm UTI diagnosis – (Table 2). Key investigations and their interpretation are given below.

TABLE 2.
Summary of Diagnostic and Other Initial Investigations in Children With cUTI

As with uncomplicated UTI, clean catch urine collection is preferred due to its noninvasive nature, with catheterization or suprapubic aspiration being the gold standards if collection is difficult or diagnosis is uncertain. In infants under 2 months, clean catch methods are challenging and can result in up to 38% contaminated samples, so catheterization or suprapubic aspiration is advised. Up to 88% of specimens collected via a urine bag with a positive culture will be false positives, so they should only be used in nonurgent situations as an initial screening measure; a negative result confirms the absence of a UTI.

Urine Dipstick Analysis

If leukocyte esterase is greater than trace, pyuria is present. Dipsticks may be false negatives in children with < 3 months with high voiding frequency or with Enterococcus spp. or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These pathogens have a reduced ability to convert nitrate to nitrite, and Enterococcus spp. may not induce a strong inflammatory response to increase leukocyte esterase.– Dipsticks may be false positives due to contamination, fever of a different cause, localized or systemic inflammatory processes, for example, Kawasaki disease.

Urine Microscopy

Pyuria is present with ≥ 5 WBC/high-powered field with standardized or automated microscopy or ≥ 10 WBC/mm³ on a hemocytometer. Because of low sensitivity, negative urine microscopy does not exclude UTI.

### Diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infections in children [^4e6bb0e5]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Acute urinary tract infections are relatively common in children, with 8 percent of girls and 2 percent of boys having at least one episode by seven years of age. The most common pathogen is Escherichia coli, accounting for approximately 85 percent of urinary tract infections in children. Renal parenchymal defects are present in 3 to 15 percent of children within one to two years of their first diagnosed urinary tract infection. Clinical signs and symptoms of a urinary tract infection depend on the age of the child, but all febrile children two to 24 months of age with no obvious cause of infection should be evaluated for urinary tract infection (with the exception of circumcised boys older than 12 months). Evaluation of older children may depend on the clinical presentation and symptoms that point toward a urinary source (e.g., leukocyte esterase or nitrite present on dipstick testing; pyuria of at least 10 white blood cells per high-power field and bacteriuria on microscopy). Increased rates of E. coli resistance have made amoxicillin a less acceptable choice for treatment, and studies have found higher cure rates with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Other treatment options include amoxicillin/clavulanate and cephalosporins. Prophylactic antibiotics do not reduce the risk of subsequent urinary tract infections, even in children with mild to moderate vesicoureteral reflux. Constipation should be avoided to help prevent urinary tract infections. Ultrasonography, cystography, and a renal cortical scan should be considered in children with urinary tract infections.

Microbiological Assessments

The remaining urine in the sterile container was used for bacteriological culture at the microbiology department. For all included patients with UTI and control patients, 10 µL of noncentrifuged urine was placed on routine culture media and incubated for 1 day. A culture result was deemed positive in case of growth of 10⁴ CFU/Ml or more and defined as a monoculture if 90% or more of the cultured colonies were of 1 microorganism.

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 27.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). Data are presented as percentages, means with standard deviations, or medians with interquartile ranges, as appropriate. A Mann–Whitney U test was performed to compare leukocyte medians between patients with UTI and controls. As a pyuria threshold for UTI in older women is not known, sensitivity–specificity pairs with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for all possible cutoffs and plotted in a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve using GraphPad Prism version 9.3.1 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated to determine the discriminative ability of the index tests (automated microscopy and urine flowcytometry). Youden's index was used to determine the cutoff value with the optimal trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. In a fraction of UTI cases, automated microscopy results were missing (eg, only semiquantitative results were available [leukocyte esterase or leukocytes/hpf]). The impact of missing automated microscopy results on estimates of accuracy was evaluated by a sensitivity analysis consisting of best- and worst-case scenarios (all missing pyuria results were either considered true positive and negative or false positive and negative, respectively). Twenty-seven patients presenting with LUTSs were not included in the primary analysis because they did not meet the urine culture criteria for the UTI group. Their urine leukocyte counts were evaluated separately, in the secondary analysis.

### Diagnostic and treatment difficulties of pyelonephritis in pregnancy in resource-limited settings [^4f568980]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2010). Low credibility.

Pyelonephritis is essentially a clinical diagnosis. The sensitivity and specificity of leukocyte esterase and nitrites in this cohort are in agreement with a meta-analysis that found sensitivity and specificity of nitrites were around 50% and 95%, whereas leukocyte esterase was highly variable, with a sensitivity of 50–60% and a lower specificity than nitrites. It has been suggested that nitrites alone indicate the need for further urine testing and could be used to initiate treatment, which would overtreat a large percentage of patients in this setting. Urine sediment microscopy proved more sensitive than urine dipsticks for diagnosis of pyelonephritis. A WBC count of ≥ 7/HPF in the presence of bacteria and with epithelial cell count < 5/HPF predicted a positive urine culture with the highest sensitivity, but this was not as specific as WBC count of ≥ 10/HPF or the presence of leukocytes and nitrites on urine dipstick. In areas where microscopy is practiced routinely to diagnose malaria and microbiological facilities are not available, the urine sediment is likely to provide a cheap alternative for urine examination. Cut-offs are best confirmed with microbiological support, but this could be done as a survey. Known limitations of the dipstick nitrite test in diagnosing bacteriuria include infection with non–nitrite-producing pathogens and insufficient time since the last void for nitrites to appear at detectable levels (ideally, at least 4 hours); in this setting, another limitation is possibly a lack of dietary nitrate.

AAP clinical practice guideline — Action Statement 2 (assessment and initial testing pathway): If a clinician assesses a febrile infant with no apparent source for the fever as not being so ill as to require immediate antimicrobial therapy, then the clinician should assess the likelihood of UTI. If the clinician determines the febrile infant to have a low likelihood of UTI, then clinical follow-up monitoring without testing is sufficient (evidence quality: A; strong recommendation). If the clinician determines that the febrile infant is not in a low-risk group, then there are 2 choices (evidence quality: A; strong recommendation): Option 1 is to obtain a urine specimen through catheterization or SPA for culture and urinalysis; Option 2 is to obtain a urine specimen through the most convenient means and to perform a urinalysis, proceeding to catheterization or SPA and culture if urinalysis suggests UTI, whereas if urinalysis of fresh (less than 1 hour since void) urine yields negative leukocyte esterase and nitrite results, it is reasonable to monitor the clinical course without initiating antimicrobial therapy, recognizing that a negative urinalysis does not rule out a UTI with certainty. When illness severity and UTI risk are extremely low, the patient may be observed without assessing the urine, and this 2-step process (Option 2) has been shown feasible and beneficial in a pediatric emergency department, with the catheterization rate decreasing from 63% to fewer than 30% without increasing length of stay or missing UTIs.

### Relationship between urinalysis findings and responsible pathogens in children with urinary tract infections [^a044c86c]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Pyuria, presence of bacteria, leukocyte esterase, and nitrite positivity in urinalysis should be considered together, and simultaneous urine culture test should be performed in the diagnostic evaluation of urinary tract infection (UTI). The absence of pyuria in urinalysis cannot exclude UTI in patients with suggestive clinical findings.

Objective

It was aimed to assess relationship between urinalysis tests and uropathogen and to evaluate antibiotic resistance in children.

Methods

The study included patients (aged 0–18 years) with significant uropathogen growth in urine culture tests. The patients' data regarding age, gender, results of urine microscopy, urine culture, and antibiogram were recorded retrospectively.

Results

Overall, 705 patients (562 girls, 143 boys) with significant growth in urine culture test were included. Median age was 72 months among girls and 12 months among boys. Most common uropathogens were Escherichia coli (79.6%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.2%). E. coli was more commonly among girls (87%) and Klebsiella spp. among boys (53.3%). Pyuria was positive in urinalysis in 75% of patients. Pyuria presence was more common in patients with E.coli or Proteus spp. (80.6% and 71.4%, respectively) than those with Enterococcus spp. and Klebsiella spp. (52.0% and 53.3%, respectively). In culture antibiogram tests, ampicillin resistance was 100% in Klebsiella oxytoca and Enterobacter spp. and 72% in E. coli strains. No ceftriaxone resistance was observed in K. oxytoca, Citrobacter spp. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp.

Discussion

Most UTIs were seen in older girls. Pyuria might be lacking in UTIs associated to Klebsiella spp. and Enterococcus spp., and absence of pyuria may not exclude UTI in patients with compatible clinical findings. Ceftriaxone is still an option in empirical treatment; unnecessary use of third-generation cephalosporins should be avoided, particularly in infections other than UTI.

Conlusions

It was found that E. coli more commonly caused leukocyturia, leukocyte esterase positivity, and pyuria; that pyuria might be lacking in UTIs associated to Klebsiella spp. and Enterococcus spp. and that pyuria was more prevalent among girls. It is though that urine culture tests should be performed in children with suspected UTI even in the absence of pyuria because lack of pyuria may lead delay in diagnosis and treatment as well as renal scar formation.

### Association between uropathogen and pyuria… [^f3eb3e70]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

We sought to determine factors associated with the absence of pyuria in symptomatic children whose urine culture was positive for a known uropathogen. We obtained data on children evaluated at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh emergency department between 2007 and 2013 with symptoms of urinary tract infection who had paired urinalysis and urine cultures. We excluded children with an unknown or bag urine collection method, major genitourinary anomalies, immunocompromising conditions, or with multiple organisms on culture. We chose a single, randomly-selected urine specimen per child and limited the analysis to those with positive cultures. Enterococcus species, Klebsiella species, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were significantly less likely to exhibit pyuria than children with Escherichia coli. Children with these organisms were also less likely to have a positive leukocyte esterase on dipstick urinalysis.

Results were similar when we restricted the analysis to children whose urine samples were collected by bladder catheterization. We found that certain uropathogens are less likely to be associated with pyuria in symptomatic children. Identification of biomarkers more accurate than pyuria or leukocyte esterase may help reduce over- and undertreatment of UTIs. Comments. The leukocyte esterase test is ill-suited to serve this role because: a significant proportion of children with asymptomatic bacteriuria have pyuria 1, approximately 10% to 20% of children with UTI do not have pyuria, 2 and 3) in our study, 3 and in a subsequent study by Lubell, 4 the likelihood of observing pyuria varied by the type of uropathogen present. In our sample of young infants with bacteremic UTI, a condition that cannot be explained by contamination or AB, 99.

5% of subjects had a UA that was positive for either leukocyte esterase or pyuria. 2 The accompanying commentary to our article concluded that "the absence of pyuria should create great doubt about the presence of a UTI.

### Optimizing reflex urine cultures: using a population-specific approach to diagnostic stewardship [^3ce94708]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinicians and laboratories routinely use urinalysis (UA) parameters to determine whether antimicrobial treatment and/or urine cultures are needed. Yet the performance of individual UA parameters and common thresholds for action are not well defined and may vary across different patient populations.

Methods

In this retrospective cohort study, we included all encounters with UAs ordered 24 hours prior to a urine culture between 2015 and 2020 at 3 North Carolina hospitals. We evaluated the performance of relevant UA parameters as potential outcome predictors, including sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV). We also combined 18 different UA criteria and used receiver operating curves to identify the 5 best-performing models for predicting significant bacteriuria (≥ 100,000 colony-forming units of bacteria/mL).

Results

In 221,933 encounters during the 6-year study period, no single UA parameter had both high sensitivity and high specificity in predicting bacteriuria. Absence of leukocyte esterase and pyuria had a high NPV for significant bacteriuria. Combined UA parameters did not perform better than pyuria alone with regard to NPV. The high NPV ≥ 0.90 of pyuria was maintained among most patient subgroups except females aged ≥ 65 years and patients with indwelling catheters.

Conclusion

When used as a part of a diagnostic workup, UA parameters should be leveraged for their NPV instead of sensitivity. Because many laboratories and hospitals use reflex urine culture algorithms, their workflow should include clinical decision support and or education to target symptomatic patients and focus on populations where absence of pyuria has high NPV.

### Rapid tests and urine sampling techniques for the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) in children under five years: a systematic review [^7ea1fb83]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common sources of infection in children under five. Prompt diagnosis and treatment is important to reduce the risk of renal scarring. Rapid, cost-effective, methods of UTI diagnosis are required as an alternative to culture.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review to determine the diagnostic accuracy of rapid tests for detecting UTI in children under five years of age.

Results

The evidence supports the use of dipstick positive for both leukocyte esterase and nitrite (pooled LR+ = 28.2, 95% CI: 17.3, 46.0) or microscopy positive for both pyuria and bacteriuria (pooled LR+ = 37.0, 95% CI: 11.0, 125.9) to rule in UTI. Similarly dipstick negative for both LE and nitrite (Pooled LR- = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.16, 0.26) or microscopy negative for both pyuria and bacteriuria (Pooled LR- = 0.11, 95% CI: 0.05, 0.23) can be used to rule out UTI. A test for glucose showed promise in potty-trained children. However, all studies were over 30 years old. Further evaluation of this test may be useful.

Conclusion

Dipstick negative for both LE and nitrite or microscopic analysis negative for both pyuria and bacteriuria of a clean voided urine, bag, or nappy/pad specimen may reasonably be used to rule out UTI. These patients can then reasonably be excluded from further investigation, without the need for confirmatory culture. Similarly, combinations of positive tests could be used to rule in UTI, and trigger further investigation.

### Diagnostic stewardship cutoffs for urinalysis results prior to performing a urine culture: analysis of data from a healthcare system [^111605bf]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The growing incidence of infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant bacteria poses a significant public health threat, driven heavily by inappropriate antibiotic use. Diagnostic stewardship, including tools like reflex urine culture, can help reduce unnecessary testing and subsequent unwarranted antibiotic treatments, though optimal thresholds are not well-defined. In our analysis of urinary parameters, urine microscopy WBC count demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy for predicting the presence of uropathogens.

Our study findings show that no single urinalysis parameter achieves both high sensitivity and specificity for detecting uropathogens from urine culture. However, WBC count on the microscopic portion of the urinalysis showed the best test performance with an AUC of 0.72, indicating acceptable or fair discriminative power.

Our results align with an analysis of University of Pittsburgh Medical Center healthcare system data, which assessed urinalysis parameters for diagnostic accuracy of "significant bacteriuria", a proxy definition for UTI. They found that WBC had the best diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.79), followed by leukocyte esterase (AUC = 0.78) and bacteria (AUC = 0.77). Interestingly, our AUC values were lower. Differences may stem from test ordering practice variation, with some systems performing urinalysis with urine cultures more or less discriminately, including ordering tests for patients without UTI symptoms. The bias introduced by selecting patients based on clinician-initiated urinalysis ordering, rather than on symptoms, has been shown to underestimate diagnostic accuracy and may have contributed to inter-study variability in AUC results. Another key difference is our mean population age was lower (48 versus 57 years), attributed to our inclusion of children, whereas the other study included only adults. Increased age is associated with a higher prevalence of pyuria and colonization in women, – which might contribute to test performance differences. Finally, uropathogen definition differences may explain discrepant AUC values. The previous study's outcome was > 10,000 colony forming units (CFU)/mL, whereas our definition was organisms likely to prompt clinical action.

### The importance of urine concentration on the diagnostic performance of the urinalysis for pediatric urinary tract infection [^270eef26]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Study Objective

The presence of leukocyte esterase by urine dipstick and microscopic pyuria are both indicators of possible urinary tract infection. The effect of urine concentration on the diagnostic performance of the urinalysis for pediatric urinary tract infection has not been studied. Our objective is to determine whether the urinalysis performance for detecting urinary tract infection varies by urine concentration as measured by specific gravity.

Methods

This was a retrospective cross-sectional study of the urine laboratory results of children younger than 13 years who presented to the emergency department during 68 months and had a paired urinalysis and urine culture obtained. Urinary tract infection was defined as pure growth of a uropathogen at standard culture thresholds. Test characteristics were calculated across 4 specific gravity groups (1.000 to 1.010, 1.011 to 1.020, 1.021 to 1.030, and > 1.030).

Results

In total, 14,971 cases were studied. Median age was 1.5 years (interquartile range 0.4 to 5.5 years) and 60% were female patients. Prevalence of urinary tract infection was 7.7%. For the presence of leukocyte esterase and a range of pyuria cut points, the positive likelihood ratios decreased with increasing specific gravity. From most dilute to most concentrated urine, the positive likelihood ratio decreased from 12.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 10.7 to 13.7) to 4.2 (95% CI 3.0 to 5.8) and 9.5 (95% CI 8.6 to 10.6) to 5.5 (95% CI 3.3 to 9.1) at a threshold of greater than or equal to 5 WBCs per high-power field and presence of leukocyte esterase, respectively. The negative likelihood ratios increased with increasing specific gravity for leukocyte esterase and microscopic pyuria.

Conclusion

For the detection of pediatric urinary tract infection, the diagnostic performance of both dipstick leukocyte esterase and microscopic pyuria varies by urine concentration, and therefore the specific gravity should be considered when the urinalysis is interpreted.

### Accuracy of leukocyte esterase and nitrite tests for diagnosing bacteriuria in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b947645f]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Urine dipsticks are commonly used for the diagnosis of bacteriuria and/or urinary tract infections (UTIs).

Objectives

To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the accuracy of positive leukocyte esterase and/or nitrite results from dipsticks (index test) for diagnosing bacteriuria in older individuals, using urine culture as the reference standard.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (Pubmed), EMBASE, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from the inception date up to April 2025. We also searched the reference lists of all the studies identified.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Both prospective observational cohort and case-control diagnostic studies were included. No language restriction was applied.

Participants

Individuals aged 60 or more with or without symptoms of UTI in the community, nursing homes or hospitalised.

Assessment Of Risk Of Bias

We used the Quality Assessment tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS)-2 tool for assessing risk of bias.

Methods Of Data Synthesis

A random-effect meta-analysis was performed to determine the pooled sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of leukocyte esterase and/or nitrites for the detection of bacteriuria. PROSPERO identifier: CRD42024561882.

Results

Of 1,933 articles screened, 16 met inclusion criteria and had moderate risk of bias. Ten studies were hospital-based; six were in nursing homes. Pooled urine dipstick sensitivity and specificity for bacteriuria were 90% (95% CI, 84–94%), and 56% (43–68%), respectively (diagnostic odds ratio [DOR] 11.4; 10.4–12.7). In symptomatic older adults, the sensitivity and specificity for predicting UTI were 92% (76–97%) and 39% (19–62%), respectively, with a DOR of 7.3 (5.2–10.3).

Discussion

A positive dipstick result is inconclusive and does not confirm bacteriuria or UTI in symptomatic older adults. Due to high asymptomatic bacteriuria prevalence in older individuals, bacteriuria alone lacks diagnostic value. These findings support discontinuing dipstick testing for UTI diagnosis in this population.

### The inadequacy of urinary dipstick and microscopy as surrogate markers of urinary tract infection in urological outpatients with lower urinary tract symptoms without acute frequency and dysuria [^1c35ae21]. The Journal of Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

Diagnosing urinary infection in patients with chronic lower urinary tract symptoms without dysuria is a critical step. In this study we scrutinize the sensitivity and specificity of dipstick urinalysis and microscopic pyuria (10 or more white blood cells per microl) to identify infection in such patients.

Materials and Methods

This was a prospective, blinded, observational cohort study of urological outpatients with painless lower urinary tract symptoms. Midstream and catheter urine samples were analyzed. A total of 508 midstream urine samples were used to compare leukocyte esterase, nitrite dipstick and urine microscopy with cultures seeking 10⁵ cfu/ml. Similarly 470 catheter urine samples were used to compare the same surrogates with 10⁵ cfu/ml and with an enhanced culture method seeking 10² cfu/ml. A comparison of leukocyte esterase against microscopic pyuria was made using the 508 midstream and 470 catheter specimens of urine. Midstream urine specimens were provided by 42 normal volunteers for comparison.

Results

For a midstream urine culture at 10⁵ cfu/mL leukocyte esterase was 56% sensitive, nitrite was 10% sensitive and microscopic pyuria was 56% sensitive. Specificities were 66%, 99% and 72%, respectively. For a catheter specimen of urine culture at 10⁵ cfu/mL leukocyte esterase was 59% sensitive, nitrite was 20% sensitive and microscopic pyuria was 66% sensitive. Specificities were 84%, 97% and 73%, respectively. The enhanced culture of catheter specimen of urine at 10² cfu/mL was positive in 29% of patients vs 15% at 10⁵ cfu/mL.

Conclusions

Despite official guidelines and widespread use these tests cannot be considered appropriate for diagnosing urinary tract infection in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms, and should be abandoned in this context.

### A blinded observational cohort study of the microbiological ecology associated with pyuria and overactive bladder symptoms [^da9ba55d]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The relationship between infection, inflammation and the generation of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms has not been scrutinised in a prospective, controlled study, and our dismissal of an infective association for this symptom group may be compromised by deficiencies in urinalysis on which we rely heavily. Quantitative microbiological bacterial culture remains the reference gold standard in the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI). However, it is now appreciated that in patients with nonacute lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), a midstream urine culture (MSU) that does not show ≥ 10⁵ colony-forming units (CFU) μl⁻¹ of a single species of a known urinary pathogen does not exclude significant UTI. There is growing evidence of polymicrobial infections of the urinary tract. Traditional culture methods assume, without evidence, dominant pathogenicity from the Enterobacteriaceae species, notably E. coli, so the MSU culture is performed on selective media, favouring Enterobacteriaceae under aerobic conditions. This culture method will miss a number of potential pathogens. Microscopic counting of pyuria remains the best surrogate marker of UTI that we have. However, in some clinical settings, dipstick tests to detect leucocyte esterase have replaced leucocyte counting by fresh-urine microscopic examination, without validation. Despite this, some laboratories use dipsticks to screen urine samples; others use microscopy, only culturing urine samples that are pyuria-positive. Where microscopy is used, the delay caused by specimen transit compromises the specimen. In assessing anyone who presents with OAB, a mandatory step is the exclusion of UTI, but given the deficiencies in the tests, an OAB diagnosis may be flawed.

Studies of patients in the broader category of LUTS report increased inflammatory activity and bacterial colonisation not seen in asymptomatic controls. Bacterial strains from LUTS patients were shown to invade urothelial cell lines, whilst bacteria isolated from controls did not. It is possible that LUTS may be associated with urothelial microbial changes that stimulates an inflammatory response, generating the symptoms. OAB is an important subclass of LUTS that merits specific attention. Lunawat et al. found that in all 61 patients with OAB and pyuria but negative routine microbial culture, bladder biopsies manifested all the uroepithelial features of chronic cystitis; no features of inflammation were identified in control samples. Vijaya et al. found increased bacterial growth on culturing bladder biopsies obtained at cystoscopy from patients with OAB despite negative MSU culture.

Obstructing stones with suspected infection — laboratory evaluation: for adult and pediatric patients, clinicians should obtain a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, urinalysis, and urine culture to assess for infection and guide clinical decision-making (Expert Opinion). A urinalysis should be obtained to assess for pyuria, leukocyte esterase, and nitrites; urinalysis offers timely information to act on, whereas urine culture, though essential for identifying pathogens and guiding targeted therapy, is not typically available immediately.

### The use of urinary dipstick tests to exclude urinary tract infection: a systematic review of the literature [^c3e937dd]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2006). Low credibility.

Several systematic reviews have examined the use of dipstick tests to diagnose or rule in urinary tract infection (UTI). We examined the evidence relating to the use of urine leukocyte esterase and nitrite tests in adults to exclude or rule out UTI. A search of the literature from 1966 to 2003 revealed 30 studies as containing relevant and suitable information and 23 of these, which used a cut-off of 10⁸ colony-forming units per liter, were combined in a meta-analysis. The leukocyte esterase or nitrite test combination, with one or the other test positive, was used in 14 studies, showed the highest sensitivity and the lowest negative likelihood ratio. While there was significant heterogeneity between the studies, 7 of 14 demonstrated significant decreases in pretest to posttest probability with a pooled posttest probability of 5% for the negative result. In certain circumstances, there is evidence for the use of urinalysis as a rule-out test for UTI.

### Now you see It-but what If you don't! can a UTI occur in the absence of pyuria? [^a73c9fef]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

When we obtain a urinalysis in a young patient and find there is no evidence of pyuria, do we instantly assume there is no infection. We would bet that is the case for the vast majority of us who see a negative dipstick or better yet a negative urinalysis for pyuria on a daily basis. But is that a good assumption to make. Shaikh et al. report on their study of 6 years' worth of urinary tract infections for which they paired a positive culture result with the urinalysis for catheterized specimens in children who did not have major genitourinary or immunocompromised conditions and whose cultures did not represent contaminants. Pyuria was defined as more than 5 white blood cells per high-powered field or more than 10 white cells per cubic millimeter and was absent in 13% of the pure positive cultures.

What's even more interesting are the organisms that grew in the absence of white cells which included predominantly enterococcus, klebsiella, and pseudomonas. Even the dipsticks for these children did not show traces of white blood cells. So what does this mean. Should every child we get a urine on be started on antibiotics empirically for a urinalysis or dipstick that has no evidence of pyuria or a positive leukocyte esterase marker. Pediatric nephrologist Aaron Friedman takes a peek at this question in an accompanying commentary which puts the results in context — and context is certainly important here since the children who did have UTIs in this study also had symptoms and other signs that indicated there was a problem even if the white cell indicators were absent.

Go with the flow of information in this study and commentary and at least keep your diagnostic radar for suspecting a UTI high if your patient is symptomatic even if the urinalysis doesn't show the white cells you might normally be expecting. How often have you diagnosed a UTI that is culture confirmed in the absence of pyuria.

### Urinary tract infection and antimicrobial stewardship in the emergency department [^f5d21258]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aims of this study were to assess empiric antibiotic use for presumed urinary tract infection (UTI) in the emergency department (ED) and to determine how often urine culture results subsequently do not confirm the diagnosis.

Methods

This study is a retrospective cohort study of patients aged 21 years or younger in the Nationwide Children's Hospital ED from May 1, 2012, to October 31, 2012, who had a urinalysis and urine culture performed and were discharged home with empiric antibiotic therapy for presumed UTI. Patients with known urinary tract anomaly or antibiotic use in the previous 7 days were excluded. Confirmed UTI was defined as pyuria (> 5 white blood cells per high-power field or dipstick positive for leukocyte esterase) and a positive urine culture (≥ 50,000 colony-forming units/mL of a uropathogen).

Results

Of the 175 enrolled patients, urine was obtained by clean catch in 138 (79%), catheterization in 35 (20%), first-pass void in 1 (0.6%), and undocumented method in 1 (0.6%). Pyuria was demonstrated in 164 patients (94%), but only 97 (55%) had a positive urine culture. The combination of pyuria and a positive urine culture confirmed UTI in 90 patients (51%). The most commonly prescribed antibiotics were cefdinir in 103 patients (59%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in 40 (23%), and ciprofloxacin in 23 (13%). The median duration of prescribed therapy was 10 days (interquartile range, 7–10 days). Treatment duration was correlated negatively with age (r = -0.53, P < 0.01).

Conclusions

The current management of suspected UTI in ED patients results in unnecessary antibiotic exposure, highlighting an important opportunity for outpatient antimicrobial stewardship efforts.

### Accuracy of screening tests for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections in young children [^fae1d12a]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The objective of this study was to compare the accuracy of available tests for pyuria, including newer automated tests, and to examine the implications of requiring them for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections (UTIs).

Methods

We included children between 1 and 36 months of age undergoing bladder catheterization for suspected UTIs who presented to 1 of 3 pediatric centers. Using a positive urine culture result as the reference standard, we compared the sensitivity of 5 modalities for assessing pyuria at the cutoffs most often used clinically for detecting children with a positive culture result: leukocyte esterase on a dipstick, white blood cell (WBC) count on manual microscopy with and without using a hemocytometer, automated WBC enumeration using flow cytometry, and automated WBC enumeration using digital imaging with particle recognition.

Results

A total of 4188 children were included. Among febrile children, the sensitivity of the 2 most widely available modalities, the leukocyte esterase test and WBC enumeration using digital imaging, had sensitivity values of 84% (95% confidence interval, 0.80–0.87) and 75% (95% confidence interval, 0.66–0.83), respectively.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that for febrile children < 36 months of age undergoing bladder catheterization for suspected UTI, pyuria will be absent in ∼20% of children who are eventually shown to have pure growth of a pathogen on a culture. This raises questions about the appropriateness of requiring pyuria for the diagnosis of UTIs.

Urinalysis predictors of culture-positive urinary tract infection (UTI) — diagnostic accuracy are summarized with sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). Leukocyte esterase (+) shows sensitivity 72–97, specificity 41–86, PPV 43–56, and NPV 82–91. Nitrites (+) shows sensitivity 19–48, specificity 92–100, PPV 50–83, and NPV 70–88. Leukocyte esterase or nitrites (+) shows sensitivity 46–100, specificity 42–98, PPV 52–68, and NPV 78–98. Protein at 3+ or higher has sensitivity 96 and specificity 87 with PPV and NPV not applicable. Microscopy with more than 5 white blood cells per high-power field (WBCs/HPF) has sensitivity 90–96, specificity 47–50, PPV 56–59, and NPV 83–95; bacteria (any amount) has sensitivity 46–58, specificity 89–94, PPV 54–88, and NPV 77–86. PPV and NPV are presented as ranges and vary with disease prevalence, decreasing PPV and increasing NPV in low-prevalence populations.

### Diagnostic accuracy of the urinalysis for urinary tract infection in infants [^62f8320a]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The 2011 American Academy of Pediatrics urinary tract infection (UTI) guideline suggests incorporation of a positive urinalysis (UA) into the definition of UTI. However, concerns linger over UA sensitivity in young infants. Infants with the same pathogenic organism in the blood and urine (bacteremic UTI) have true infections and represent a desirable population for examination of UA sensitivity.

Methods

We collected UA results on a cross-sectional sample of 276 infants < 3 months of age with bacteremic UTI from 11 hospital systems. Sensitivity was calculated on infants who had at least a partial UA performed and had ≥ 50000 colony-forming units per milliliter from the urine culture. Specificity was determined by using a random sample of infants from the central study site with negative urine cultures.

Results

The final sample included 245 infants with bacteremic UTI and 115 infants with negative urine cultures. The sensitivity of leukocyte esterase was 97.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 94.5%-99.2%) and of pyuria (> 3 white blood cells/high-power field) was 96% (95% CI 92.5%-98.1%). Only 1 infant with bacteremic UTI (Group B Streptococcus) and a complete UA had an entirely negative UA. In infants with negative urine cultures, leukocyte esterase specificity was 93.9% (95% CI 87.9–97.5) and of pyuria was 91.3% (84.6%-95.6%).

Conclusions

In young infants with bacteremic UTI, UA sensitivity is higher than previous reports in infants with UTI in general. This finding can be explained by spectrum bias or by inclusion of faulty gold standards (contaminants or asymptomatic bacteriuria) in previous studies.

### Pyuria and urine cultures in patients with acute renal colic [^97e1824e]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Renal colic caused by stone(s) is common in the emergency department. Often, urinalysis reveals white blood cells, but it is unknown how frequently pyuria is sterile or infectious.

Objectives

We sought to determine the incidence of pyuria in patients with renal colic and to correlate the incidence with a positive urine culture.

Methods

A 1-year retrospective review of adult patients with renal colic presenting to three community emergency departments was performed. Patients without confirmed renal stone(s) or completed urinalysis were excluded. Hematuria is defined as ≥ 5 red blood cells per high power field (RBC/HPF) and pyuria as > 10 white blood cells per high power field (WBC/HPF). A positive urine culture is defined as > 100,000 colony forming units per milliliter. Student's t-test, chi square, or Fisher's exact tests were performed as appropriate, with significance set at 0.05.

Results

There were 339 patients who satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and 14.2% of these patients had associated pyuria. There were 153 (45.1%) urine cultures performed, and 16 (10.5%) were positive. Patients with pyuria were more likely to have a positive urine culture (36.4% vs. 3.3%, respectively; p < 0.001). The percentage of positive urine cultures increased (p < 0.001) with increasing pyuria from 9.1% (10–20 WBC/HPF) to 60.0% (> 50 WBC/HPF). Positive cultures also increased (p < 0.001) with increased leukocyte esterase observed on macroscopic samples, from 1.6% (small or less leukocyte esterase) to 77.8% (large-volume leukocyte esterase).

Conclusion

Pyuria was found in 14.2% of patients with renal colic. Patients with pyuria had 36.4% positive cultures compared to 3.3% of patients without pyuria. The degree of pyuria or leukocyte esterase was significantly associated with the risk of a positive culture. Urine cultures are recommended for all patients with renal colic and pyuria.

### Association of pyuria with uropathogens in young children [^ee8f930e]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To examine the association between uropathogens and pyuria in children < 24 months of age.

Study Design

A retrospective study of children < 24 months of age evaluated in the emergency department for suspected urinary tract infection (UTI) with paired urinalysis and urine culture during a 6-year period. Bagged urine specimens or urine culture growing mixed/multiple urogenital organisms were excluded. Analysis was limited to children with positive urine culture as defined by the American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline culture thresholds.

Results

Of 30 462 children, 1916 had microscopic urinalysis and positive urine culture. Urine was obtained by transurethral in-and-out catheterization in 98.3% of cases. Pyuria (≥ 5 white blood cells per high-powered field) and positive leukocyte esterase (small or more) on the urine dipstick were present in 1690 (88.2%) and 1692 (88.3%) of the children respectively. Children with non-Escherichia coli species were less likely to exhibit microscopic pyuria than children with E coli (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.17–0.34) with more pronounced effect on Enterococcus and Klebsiella (OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.03–0.18 and OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.11–0.27 respectively). Similarly, positive leukocyte esterase was less frequently seen in non-E coli uropathogens compared with E coli.

Conclusions

Pyuria and leukocyte esterase are not sensitive markers to identify non-E coli UTI in young children. More sensitive screening biomarkers are needed to identify UTI with these uropathogens.

UTIs are common, potentially severe infections that the emergency physician must manage efficiently and effectively. In most cases, this entity is well recognized, and the clinician will be confident of the correct course. However, in certain populations, complications are common, and the best therapy has yet to be proven. Tailoring the evaluation and treatment to the risk of complications is imperative. With careful evaluation, individualized therapy and close follow-up, the majority of patients can be expected to do well.

### Urinalysis: a comprehensive review… [^1fec72d3]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Urologic Hematuria Urologic causes of hematuria include tumors, calculi, and infections. Urologic hematuria is distinguished from other etiologies by the absence of proteinuria, dysmorphic RBCs, and erythrocyte casts. Even significant hematuria will not elevate the protein concentration to the 2+ to 3+ range on the dipstick test. Persistent proteinuria is divided into three general categories: glomerular, tubular, and overflow. In glomerular proteinuria, the most common type, albumin is the primary urinary protein. Tubular proteinuria results when malfunctioning tubule cells no longer metabolize or reabsorb normally filtered protein. In this condition, low–molecular-weight proteins predominate over albumin and rarely exceed 2 g per day. In overflow proteinuria, low–molecular-weight proteins overwhelm the ability of the tubules to reabsorb filtered proteins.

Further evaluation of persistent proteinuria usually includes determination of 24-hour urinary protein excretion or spot urinary protein-creatinine ratio, microscopic examination of the urinary sediment, urinary protein electrophoresis, and assessment of renal function.
32. NITRITES Nitrites normally are not found in urine but result when bacteria reduce urinary nitrates to nitrites. Many gram-negative and some gram-positive organisms are capable of this conversion, and a positive dipstick nitrite test indicates that these organisms are present in significant numbers. This test is specific but not highly sensitive. Thus, a positive result is helpful, but a negative result does not rule out UTI. LEUKOCYTE ESTERASE Leukocyte esterase is produced by neutrophils and may signal pyuria associated with UTI.

To detect significant pyuria accurately, 30 seconds to two minutes should be allowed for the dipstick reagent strip to change color, depending in the brand used. Leukocyte casts in the urinary sediment can help localize the area of inflammation to the kidney. Organisms such as Chlamydia and Ureaplasma urealyticum should be considered in patients with pyuria and negative cultures. Other causes of sterile pyuria include balanitis, urethritis, tuberculosis, bladder tumors, viral infections, nephrolithiasis, foreign bodies, exercise, glomerulonephritis, and corticosteroid and cyclophosphamide use.

### Improving urinary tract infection diagnostics in oncology: reliability of reflex urine culture in immunosuppressed neutropenic and non-neutropenic cancer patients [^7fac21e8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections are prone to overdiagnosis, and reflex urine culture protocols offer a valuable opportunity for diagnostic stewardship in this arena. However, there is no recommended standard testing approach. Patients with cancer are often excluded from reflex urine culture protocols, especially if they are severely immunosuppressed or neutropenic. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance characteristics of urine screening studies, including dipstick urinalysis for nitrite and leukocyte esterase and urine microscopy for white blood cell count, to detect significant pathogen growth.

Methods

A retrospective study of 58 098 urine cultures with a paired dipstick urinalysis with or without urine microscopy was performed at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, evaluating data from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2020. A dipstick urinalysis was considered negative only if leukocyte esterase and nitrite were undetected.

Results

A negative dipstick urinalysis had a negative predictive value of 98% for clinically significant bacteriuria in voided urine and 95% for catheterized urine. Notably, a negative urine dipstick test screen maintained a high negative predictive value among patients with neutropenia and in those with antibiotic exposure before testing. Finally, the presence of pyuria ≥ 10 white blood cells per high-power field on urine microscopy offered negligible incremental diagnostic benefit in samples with a negative dipstick urinalysis.

Conclusions

Reflex urine culture protocols contingent upon a screening dipstick urinalysis are a safe and effective platform for diagnostic stewardship in patients with cancer including those with neutropenia.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^a0aaf861]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Pyuria thresholds and assessment — The absence of pyuria in children with true UTIs is rare; common explanations for bacteriuria without pyuria include contaminated specimens, insensitive pyuria criteria, and asymptomatic bacteriuria. Standard microscopy of centrifuged urine uses a threshold of 5 white blood cells (WBCs) per high-power field (~25 WBCs per μL), whereas in uncentrifuged urine a counting chamber threshold of at least 10 WBCs per μL has been demonstrated to be more sensitive and performs well in very young infants.

In a multihospital cohort study of 3392 patients, positive urinalysis parameters had poor positive predictive value for diagnosing urinary tract infection (UTI). Combined urinalysis parameters (pyuria or nitrite) performed better than pyuria alone for ruling out UTI. However, performance of all urinalysis parameters was poor in older women.

Diagnostic stewardship — urine cultures — Avoid testing in nonspecific clinical syndromes (eg, leukocytosis, isolated fever, fatigue, and fall), do not order based on odor or smell, and educate on prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria and lack of treatment benefit. For collection, do not collect from catheter bag and only culture urine if pyuria present on urinalysis. For reporting, use selective and cascade reporting to help tailor antibiotic choices and add comments to nudge toward only using antibiotics with true symptoms of UTI.

Symptomatic UTI with pyuria

Data were obtained from women who presented themselves to the research facility in order to provide a urine sample in 70 out of 104 symptomatic UTI episodes. Eighty-one percent of the 70 urine samples obtained presented pyuria as measured by a positive leucocyte esterase dipstick test. No statistically significant reductions in the incidence rate of symptomatic UTI with pyuria were found between treatment groups. In women with less than 5 UTIs in the 12 months prior to enrolment, the daily intake of 2 × 18.5 mg PAC, compared to 2 × 1 mg PAC, was associated with a statistically significant 47% reduction in the age-adjusted incidence rate of symptomatic UTI with pyuria (IRR = 0.54, 95%CI 0.30–0.99), where symptomatic UTI without urine samples were classified as symptomatic UTI with pyuria (Table 7)).

Symptomatic UTI with bacteriuria

Urine culture was performed in 61 of the 70 urine samples collected during symptomatic UTI. A positive culture was confirmed in 49% of the 61 urine samples analyzed during symptomatic UTI. No statistically significant reductions in the age-adjusted incidence rate of symptomatic UTI with bacteriuria were found between groups nor in sub-group analyses in women with less than 5 UTIs in the 12 months prior to enrolment (Table 8).

### Assessment of asymptomatic bacteriuria and sterile pyuria among antenatal attendants in hospitals in Northern Ghana [^cf8027f4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults (IDSA) recommends that all pregnant women should be screened for bacteriuria by urine culture at least once in early pregnancy, and if results are positive, treatment is justified. Screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria is necessary for patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate and other urologic procedures in which mucosal bleeding is expected. However no reference can be made for screening for or treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in renal transplant or other solid organ transplant recipients.

Another urinary tract condition which is also not rare in pregnancy is Sterile Pyuria (SP). Although no current definition exists, SP is considered if a mid-stream urine specimen has 10 or more white blood cells per cubic millimeter or a urinary dipstick test is leukocyte esterase positive with no associated positive urinary culture. Sterile pyuria has vast aetiological spectrum including sexually transmitted diseases, tuberculosis, interstitial cystitis, chlamydia and cystitis. Population-based studies recount it as a highly prevalent condition with 13.9% of women and 2.6% of men being affected, with its preponderance in women attributable to pelvic infections.

Various studies have consistently revealed that early diagnosis and treatment of UTI in pregnancy exorbitantly reduce sequelae associated with the condition. Treatment of ASB in pregnancy with antibiotics has been found to decrease pyelonephritis from 35 to 4%, improve fetal outcomes and prevent preterm deliveries. Several institutions prescribe screening of pregnant women for ASB due to the benefits of treatment. But, in many developing countries such as Ghana, ASB screening in pregnancy is normally overlooked in antenatal management. The prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria and sterile pyuria in the Northern regions of Ghana are not known. The aim of this assessment was to screen mid-stream urine of antenatal attendants at the Tamale Teaching Hospital and Tamale Central Hospital for sterile pyuria and asymptomatic bacteriuria with associated agents and their susceptibility profiles. This was to contribute to the literature bank of urinary tract infections at these secondary and tertiary care hospitals.

### Current pyuria cutoffs promote inappropriate urinary tract infection diagnosis in older women [^87beaecb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Pre-existing lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), cognitive impairment, and the high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) complicate the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) in older women. The presence of pyuria remains the cornerstone of UTI diagnosis. However, > 90% of ASB patients have pyuria, prompting unnecessary treatment. We quantified pyuria by automated microscopy and flowcytometry to determine the diagnostic accuracy for UTI and to derive pyuria thresholds for UTI in older women.

Methods

Women ≥ 65 years with ≥ 2 new-onset LUTS and 1 uropathogen ≥ 104 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL were included in the UTI group. Controls were asymptomatic and classified as ASB (1 uropathogen ≥ 105 CFU/mL), negative culture, or mixed flora. Patients with an indwelling catheter or antimicrobial pretreatment were excluded. Leukocyte medians were compared and sensitivity-specificity pairs were derived from a receiver operating characteristic curve.

Results

We included 164 participants. UTI patients had higher median urinary leukocytes compared with control patients (microscopy: 900 vs 26 leukocytes/µL; flowcytometry: 1575 vs 23 leukocytes/µL; P < .001). Area under the curve was 0.93 for both methods. At a cutoff of 264 leukocytes/µL, sensitivity and specificity of microscopy were 88% (positive and negative likelihood ratio: 7.2 and 0.1, respectively). The commonly used cutoff of 10 leukocytes/µL had a poor specificity (36%) and a sensitivity of 100%.

Conclusions

The degree of pyuria can help to distinguish UTI in older women from ASB and asymptomatic controls with pyuria. Current pyuria cutoffs are too low and promote inappropriate UTI diagnosis in older women. Clinical Trials Registration.

### Utility of a routine urinalysis in children who require clean intermittent catheterization [^957e452e]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Children who require clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) frequently have positive urine cultures. However, diagnosing a urinary tract infection (UTI) can be difficult, as there are no standardized criteria. Routine urinalysis (UA) has good predictive accuracy for UTI in the general pediatric population, but data are limited on the utility of routine UA in the population of children who require CIC.

Objective

To determine the utility of UA parameters (e.g. leukocyte esterase, nitrites, and pyuria) to predict UTI in children who require CIC, and identify a composite UA that has maximal predictive accuracy for UTI.

Methods

A cross-sectional study of 133 children who required CIC, and had a UA and urine culture sent as part of standard of care. Patients in the no-UTI group all had UA and urine cultures sent as part of routine urodynamics, and were asymptomatic. Patients included in the UTI group had growth of ≥ 50,000 colony-forming units/ml of a known uropathogen on urine culture, in addition to two or more of the following symptoms: fever, abdominal pain, back pain, foul-smelling urine, new or worse incontinence, and pain with catheterization. Categorical data were compared using Chi-squared test, and continuous data were compared with Student's t-test. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated for individual UA parameters, as well as the composite UA. Logistic regression was performed on potential composite UA models to identify the model that best fit the data.

Results

There was a higher proportion of patients in the no-UTI group with negative leukocyte esterase compared with the UTI group. There was a higher proportion of patients with UTI who had large leukocyte esterase and positive nitrites compared with the no-UTI group (Summary Figure). There was no between-group difference in urinary white blood cells. Positive nitrites were the most specific (84.4%) for UTI. None of the parameters had a high positive predictive value, while all had high negative predictive values. The composite model with the best Akaike information criterion was > 10 urinary white blood cells and either moderate or large leukocyte esterase, which had a positive predictive value of 33.3 and a negative predictive value of 90.4.

Conclusion

Routine UA had limited sensitivity, but moderate specificity, in predicting UTI in children who required CIC. The composite UA and moderate or large leukocyte esterase both had good negative predictive values for the outcome of UTI.

Comparison with existing guidelines

SIGN guidelines for UTI in older adults advise against the use of the urine dipstick as a diagnostic test due to lack of high quality evidence. This advice is echoed by Public Health England guidance, because positive urine dipsticks are often be caused by asymptomatic bacteriuria. The results of our review contradict these recommendations, and suggest that a positive urine dipstick for nitrites and leucocytes is helpful in diagnosing UTI in symptomatic older adults. Further studies in this area are required to corroborate or refute these findings.

### Prospective cohort study of microbial and inflammatory events immediately preceding Escherichia coli recurrent urinary tract infection in women [^ac2a749b]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

A prospective cohort study was conducted to characterize the temporal sequence of microbial and inflammatory events immediately preceding Escherichia coli recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI).

Methods

Women with acute cystitis and a history of UTI within the previous year self-collected periurethral and urine samples daily and recorded measurements of urine leukocyte esterase, symptoms, and sexual intercourse daily for 3 months. rUTI strains were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and genomic virulence profiling. Urinary cytokine levels were measured.

Results

There were 38 E. coli rUTIs in 29 of 104 women. The prevalence of periurethral rUTI strain carriage increased from 46% to 90% during the 14 days immediately preceding rUTI, with similar increases in same-strain bacteriuria (from 7% to 69%), leukocyte esterase (from 31% to 64%), and symptoms (from 3% to 43%), most notably 2–3 days before rUTI (P < .05 for all comparisons). Intercourse with periurethral carriage of the rUTI strain also increased before rUTI (P = 0.008). Recurrent UTIs preceded by bacteriuria, pyuria, and symptoms were caused by strains less likely to have P fimbriae than other rUTI strains (P = 0.002).

Conclusions

Among women with frequent rUTIs, the prevalences of periurethral rUTI strain carriage, bacteriuria, pyuria, and intercourse dramatically increase over the days preceding rUTI. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of rUTI will lead to better prevention strategies.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common bacterial infections treated in the outpatient setting and range in severity from minimally symptomatic cystitis to severe septic shock in a wide array of patients. Diagnosis of uncomplicated cystitis can be inferred from history and physical, and confirmed by urinalysis. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy should rapidly improve symptoms in all UTIs. Treatment can be further tailored according to severity of illness, analysis of individualized risk factors, and antimicrobial resistance patterns.

### Current pyuria cutoffs promote inappropriate urinary tract infection diagnosis in older women [^4d7d2309]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Pre-existing lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), cognitive impairment, and the high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) complicate the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) in older women. The presence of pyuria remains the cornerstone of UTI diagnosis. However, > 90% of ASB patients have pyuria, prompting unnecessary treatment. We quantified pyuria by automated microscopy and flowcytometry to determine the diagnostic accuracy for UTI and to derive pyuria thresholds for UTI in older women.

Methods

Women ≥ 65 years with ≥ 2 new-onset LUTS and 1 uropathogen ≥ 10⁴ colony-forming units (CFU)/mL were included in the UTI group. Controls were asymptomatic and classified as ASB (1 uropathogen ≥ 10⁵ CFU/mL), negative culture, or mixed flora. Patients with an indwelling catheter or antimicrobial pretreatment were excluded. Leukocyte medians were compared and sensitivity–specificity pairs were derived from a receiver operating characteristic curve.

Results

We included 164 participants. UTI patients had higher median urinary leukocytes compared with control patients (microscopy: 900 vs 26 leukocytes/µL; flowcytometry: 1575 vs 23 leukocytes/µL; P < .001). Area under the curve was 0.93 for both methods.

The commonly used cutoff of 10 leukocytes/µL had a poor specificity (36%) and a sensitivity of 100%.

Conclusions

The degree of pyuria can help to distinguish UTI in older women from ASB and asymptomatic controls with pyuria. Current pyuria cutoffs are too low and promote inappropriate UTI diagnosis in older women.

### The urine dipstick test useful to rule out infections. A meta-analysis of the accuracy [^fafec3be]. BMC Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Many studies have evaluated the accuracy of dipstick tests as rapid detectors of bacteriuria and urinary tract infections (UTI). The lack of an adequate explanation for the heterogeneity of the dipstick accuracy stimulates an ongoing debate. The objective of the present meta-analysis was to summarise the available evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of the urine dipstick test, taking into account various pre-defined potential sources of heterogeneity.

Methods

Literature from 1990 through 1999 was searched in Medline and Embase, and by reference tracking. Selected publications should be concerned with the diagnosis of bacteriuria or urinary tract infections, investigate the use of dipstick tests for nitrites and/or leukocyte esterase, and present empirical data. A checklist was used to assess methodological quality.

Results

70 publications were included. Accuracy of nitrites was high in pregnant women (Diagnostic Odds Ratio = 165) and elderly people (DOR = 108). Positive predictive values were ≥ 80% in elderly and in family medicine. Accuracy of leukocyte-esterase was high in studies in urology patients (DOR = 276). Sensitivities were highest in family medicine (86%). Negative predictive values were high in both tests in all patient groups and settings, except for in family medicine. The combination of both test results showed an important increase in sensitivity. Accuracy was high in studies in urology patients (DOR = 52), in children (DOR = 46), and if clinical information was present (DOR = 28). Sensitivity was highest in studies carried out in family medicine (90%). Predictive values of combinations of positive test results were low in all other situations.

Conclusions

Overall, this review demonstrates that the urine dipstick test alone seems to be useful in all populations to exclude the presence of infection if the results of both nitrites and leukocyte-esterase are negative. Sensitivities of the combination of both tests vary between 68 and 88% in different patient groups, but positive test results have to be confirmed. Although the combination of positive test results is very sensitive in family practice, the usefulness of the dipstick test alone to rule in infection remains doubtful, even with high pre-test probabilities.

### Effectiveness of five different approaches in management of urinary tract infection: randomised controlled trial [^bf163e6e]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Symptom control

The upper confidence intervals for the main outcome (frequency symptoms) suggest that alternative strategies are unlikely to result in poor symptom control (around 18% worsening for the midstream urine or delayed groups, and 2% in dipstick and symptom score groups). There was some evidence that if women waited more than 48 hour they reconsulted less but had poorer control of symptoms, particularly for the midstream urine group. The finding of worse symptoms in such patients is in agreement with evidence of the effect of antibiotics from observational studies and trials. Why the delayed group who waited a similar time did not have increased symptoms, however, is unclear. This might be a chance finding, but it might be because women in the midstream urine group find passively waiting for a laboratory result to be more distressing than being given the freedom to choose when to stop the delay according to their symptoms (the empirical delayed group). A previous study treated women negative for nitrite and leucocyte esterase with antibiotics and found symptomatic benefit, but as about a third of women who have negative results for all important dipstick tests (that is, not only nitrite and leucocyte but also blood) still have urinary tract infection based on rigorous laboratory confirmation, the finding of a benefit in women with negative dipstick resultsmight be expected. The poor negative predictive value of dipsticks suggests that the offer of some kind of antibiotic safety net — such as delayed prescribing — to women with negative dipstick results is reasonable.

Antibiotic use

A modest reduction in antibiotic use (20–25%) was achieved in all groups except the symptom score group. While these reductions are probably useful for public health, and the effect might plausibly increase with time as patient expectations change, the magnitude of the effect is in contrast to delayed antibiotic prescription among patients with respiratory infections. This is perhaps not surprising given that few respiratory infections are bacterial whereas most suspected urinary tract infections are (66% of the midstream urine group had confirmed infection, similar to the previous study). There was some evidence that delayed prescribing might reduce reconsultation as we hypothesised, but this was not significant, probably because of the relatively low power of this analysis.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^49cf53f8]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — diagnostic criteria and documentation (Clinical Principle) states that clinicians should document evidence of inflammation (pyuria) and uropathogenic bacteria during symptomatic episodes, defining recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) as at least two acute episodes in six months of urinary tract–associated symptoms and signs. Evidence of infection should include significant bacteriuria and urinary inflammation (pyuria with ≥ 5 WBC/hpf on microscopic urinalysis), and the absence of pyuria rules out UTI in symptomatic women with confirmed bacteriuria. Documentation of bacterial uropathogens during each symptomatic period is critical, and inconsistent bacteriuria or organisms should prompt consideration of alternative diagnoses; given limitations of standard urine culture, clinicians should consider additional available information, including alternative tests, with critical deliberation, and it is important to consider all clinical and laboratory data when deciding whether antibiotic treatment is needed.

### Procalcitonin and pyuria-based algorithm reduces antibiotic use in urinary tract infections: a randomized controlled trial [^5208164b]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Urinalysis and urine culture with an antibiotic resistance profile were performed on admission. In patients with febrile UTI, blood cultures were taken prior to administration of antibiotics.

To determine microbiological cure and recurrence rates urinalysis and urine culture were performed on day 7 after end of therapy and day 30 after enrollment. Patients were instructed in collection of midstream urine for urinalysis and urine culture. These urine specimens were sent by mail and reached the laboratory within 48 hours.

Outcomes and follow-up

All endpoints were assessed at discharge from hospital and 30 and 90 days after enrollment through standardized telephone interviews by blinded members of the study team.

The primary endpoint was overall antibiotic exposure within 90 days. Each day of antibiotic therapy for any indication was counted as a full day of antibiotic exposure.

Secondary endpoints included duration of the initial antibiotic therapy; overall rate of recurrence, defined as any re-treated UTI; overall rate of rehospitalization for any cause within 90 days after enrollment; rate of persistent infection 7 days after end of therapy, defined as recovery of the initial uropathogen in the returned urine culture plus pyuria > 20 leucocytes/μL in the concomitant urinalysis; and rate of persistent symptomatic infection 30 days after enrollment, defined as recovery of the initial uropathogen in the returned urine culture plus pyuria > 20 leucocytes/μL in the concomitant urinalysis plus symptoms of an UTI in the 30 days phone interview.

All patients with positive urine cultures and pyuria in the follow-up samples were contacted by phone by members of the study team and advised to visit a general practitioner or an emergency room. The laboratory results were sent to the primary care providers when available, but no further guidance was given as to whether to prescribe an antibiotic.

Any serious adverse event, rehospitalization for any cause, recurrence, or death of any cause within 90 days after enrollment were monitored by the data safety and monitoring board, which consisted of three independent experts in infectious diseases, nephrology, and epidemiology.

### Office-based urinalysis: a comprehensive review [^6b3a8ffd]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Comprehensive urinalysis involves inspection of the urine, dipstick chemical analysis, and microscopy and can be performed in the office setting. When testing for urinary tract infection, midstream urine should be collected using the clean-catch technique. A urine collection bag specimen can be used for clinically stable febrile infants with suspected urinary tract infection; however, the presence of leukocyte esterase or nitrites warrants more invasive urine collection. Urine specific gravity shows hydration status. Urinary pH levels can indicate diet, metabolism, or the presence of stones. Bilirubin and urobilinogen may suggest hepatobiliary disease or hemolysis. Glucosuria often indicates uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, and ketones suggest illness and inadequate nutrition. Hematuria on dipstick testing can be confirmed in the office using a spun urine sample. Proteinuria on dipstick testing should be followed by a quantitative test such as a spot urine albumin/creatinine ratio. In patients with symptoms of a urinary tract infection, the presence of nitrites is more specific for bacterial infection, and a positive leukocyte esterase result may occur from inflammation and infection. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is often unnecessarily treated in older patients. Without symptoms of urinary tract infection, urine culture is useful only in pregnancy and preparation for endoscopic urologic procedures.

### Accuracy of urinalysis for UTI in spina bifida [^0b0813b7]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common, but overdiagnosed, in children with spina bifida. We sought to evaluate the diagnostic test characteristics of urinalysis (UA) findings for symptomatic UTI in children with spina bifida.

Methods

Retrospective cross-sectional study using data from 2 centers from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2021. Children with myelomeningocele aged < 19 years who had paired UA (and microscopy, when available) and urine culture were included. The primary outcome was symptomatic UTI. We used generalized estimating equations to control for multiple encounters per child and calculated area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, sensitivity, and specificity for positive nitrites, pyuria (≥ 10 white blood cells/high-powered field), and leukocyte esterase (more than trace) for a symptomatic UTI.

Results

We included 974 encounters from 319 unique children, of which 120 (12.3%) met our criteria for UTI. Pyuria had the highest sensitivity while nitrites were the most specific. Comparatively, nitrites were the least sensitive and pyuria was the least specific. When the cohort was limited to children with symptoms of a UTI, pyuria remained the most sensitive parameter, whereas nitrites remained the least sensitive. Nitrites continued to be the most specific, whereas pyuria was the least specific. Among all encounters, the overall area under the receiver operating characteristics curve for all components of the UA was lower in children who use clean intermittent catheterizations compared with all others.

Conclusions

Individual UA findings have moderate sensitivity (leukocyte esterase or pyuria) or specificity (nitrites) but overall poor diagnostic accuracy for symptomatic UTIs in children with spina bifida.

### Diagnostic stewardship cutoffs for urinalysis results prior to performing a urine culture: analysis of data from a healthcare system [^df2ee782]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background:

Urinary tract infections are commonly overdiagnosed. To minimize overdiagnosis, some laboratories utilize reflex algorithms that use urinalyses as preliminary screening before potentially proceeding to urine culture. However, the optimal urinalysis cutoffs for this diagnostic stewardship intervention remain poorly defined.

Methods:

We performed a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis from 2/1/21–1/31/23 in the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services healthcare system. We examined patient encounters in which urinalysis was ordered synchronously with urine culture. We categorized urine culture isolates as uropathogens or non-uropathogens. We calculated receiver operating characteristic curves of urinalysis parameters' ability, singularly or in combination, to identify uropathogens.

Results:

Among 80,949 paired urinalysis and urine cultures (17,488 inpatient, 20,716 emergency department, 42,745 outpatient), cultures yielded 35% (n = 28,993) uropathogens, 4% (n = 2960) non-uropathogens, 37% (n = 29,951) contaminants, and 24% (n = 19,045) no growth. Among urinalysis parameters, white blood cells (WBCs) had the highest diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.722, [95% CI 0.718–0.725]), followed by leukocyte esterase (AUC = 0.700, [95% CI 0.690–0.701]), bacteria (AUC = 0.673, [95% CI 0.670–0.677]), nitrite (AUC = 0.627, [95% CI 0.625–0.630]), and squamous epithelial cells (AUC = 0.530, [95% CI 0.526–0.534]). WBC AUC values were consistent across healthcare settings (outpatient, emergency department, and inpatient). The urinalysis parameter combination with the highest AUC, WBC plus bacteria, performed worse than WBCs alone (AUC = 0.711 vs. AUC = 0.722, p = 0.001).

Conclusion:

WBC on microscopic urinalysis demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy for predicting uropathogens in urine cultures. Stewardship programs should consider prioritizing urinalysis WBC count as the screening tool to optimize urine culture utilization.

The unexplored potential of longitudinal monitoring of drug exposure, host-response, and infection biomarkers in urine

Dipstick tests are frequently used to detect biomarkers qualitatively to support UTI diagnosis. Below, we categorise biomarkers frequently used in dipstick tests, and recently described as promising for UTI diagnosis, into host-response and bacteria-specific biomarkers. The detected ranges of these biomarkers are shown in Table 1.

Table 1
Biomarker levels in non UTI and UTI patients

Reported ranges of commonly used biomarkers for UTI diagnosis.

LE Leucocyte esterase, XO Xanthine Oxidase, MPO Myeloperoxidase.

Despite the development of quantitative point-of-care technologies for nitrite, leucocyte esterase(LE), xanthine oxidase (XO)and myeloperoxidase (MPO)in urine, these biomarkers are frequently reported in a yes or no fashion. The sensitivity and specificity of XO and MPO for diagnosing UTIs show promising diagnostic values (100% and 87% sensitivity for XO and MPO, 100% specificity for both). Sensitivity and specificity of a positive nitrite and LE test vary depending on UTI prevalence and the bacterial count threshold used to define a UTI. Sensitivities in different studies range from 36–57% for nitrite and 72–95% for LE, and specificities 78–98% for nitrite and 9–59% for LE.

Few studies have evaluated biomarker concentration at more than one time point during UTI, and the possibility of using quantitative measurements serially to estimate PD remains unexplored (Fig. 1). Longitudinal, quantitative monitoring of biomarkers in UTI using point-of-care technologies, alongside drug measurement, could facilitate novel approaches to real-time PK-PD monitoring and individualised antimicrobial dosing (Fig. 2).

### Clinical and financial impacts of nursing education programs on recurrent urinary tract infections after kidney transplant: a cohort study [^6792b340]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Definitions and patient classification

UTIs were classified based on significant bacteriuria (bacterial load > 10⁵ colony-forming units/mL) alongside pyuria (white blood cell count > 10 cells/high power field) or a leukocyte esterase level of at least 2 + on urine dipstick tests. Graft dysfunction was defined as an increase of more than 20% in serum creatinine within 24 to 48 h following a positive urine culture, compared to baseline serum creatinine levels. Kidney function was assessed through three consecutive serum creatinine measurements at each time point.

Statistical analysis

Data were analyzed using SPSS Version 28.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Statistical tests included the Student's t-test, Fisher's exact test, and chi-squared test to compare factors between the two groups based on UTI presence or absence. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The findings will inform future refinements of educational programs to ensure they effectively meet patient needs.

### ACP best practice No 167: the laboratory diagnosis of urinary tract infection [^a24bbfbe]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection is common, and it is not surprising that urine specimens make up a large proportion of those samples submitted to the routine diagnostic laboratory. Many of these specimens will show no evidence of infection and several methods can be used to screen out negative samples. Those that grow bacteria need to be carefully assessed to quantify the degree of bacteriuria and hence clinical relevance. To influence treatment, a final report should be produced within 24 hours of specimen receipt, with turnaround times continuously monitored. Much work needs to be done to determine the cost effectiveness involved in processing urine specimens and the evidence base for the final report provided.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^c040129a]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline — recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) definitions and related terms describe rUTI as Two separate episodes of acute bacterial cystitis and associated symptoms over a six-month period within the preceding year. Systemic urinary tract infection is defined as An infection of the urinary tract with signs and symptoms of systemic infection, with or without localized symptoms originating from any site in the urinary tract. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is Presence of bacteria in the urine that causes no illness or symptoms, and pyuria is Presence of increased numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (WBC) in the urine as evidence of an inflammatory response in the urinary tract. Complicating factors that increase risk include Anatomic or functional abnormality of the urinary tract (e.g., stone disease, diverticulum, neurogenic bladder), Immunocompromised host, and Indwelling urinary tract foreign body (e.g., indwelling urethral catheters, ureteral stents).

### Society of Critical Care Medicine and the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for evaluating new fever in adult patients in the ICU [^375810f9]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Culturing urine in febrile ICU patients with suspected UTI — For febrile ICU patients with pyuria and in whom urinary tract infection (UTI) is suspected, we recommend replacing the urinary catheter and obtaining urine cultures from the newly placed catheter (best-practice statement). The presence of urinary tract symptoms (if ascertainable)/signs and pyuria (defined as 5–10 WBC/hpf) on urinalysis should be used to justify urine culture. In those with urinary catheters, asymptomatic bacteriuria may result in false diagnoses of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI). In patients who are unable to attest to symptoms and have no other obvious source or suspicion of infection, the urinary catheter should be replaced. A urinalysis should be sent from a newly placed catheter and if WBCs are present, a urine culture should then be obtained.

### Accuracy of the urinalysis for urinary tract infections in febrile infants 60 days and younger [^e4bc8ec1]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Reports of the test accuracy of the urinalysis for diagnosing urinary tract infections (UTIs) in young febrile infants have been variable. We evaluated the test characteristics of the urinalysis for diagnosing UTIs, with and without associated bacteremia, in young febrile infants.

Methods

We performed a planned secondary analysis of data from a prospective study of febrile infants ≤ 60 days old at 26 emergency departments in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network. We evaluated the test characteristics of the urinalysis for diagnosing UTIs, with and without associated bacteremia, by using 2 definitions of UTI: growth of ≥ 50000 or ≥ 10000 colony-forming units (CFUs) per mL of a uropathogen. We defined a positive urinalysis by the presence of any leukocyte esterase, nitrite, or pyuria (> 5 white blood cells per high-power field).

Results

Of 4147 infants analyzed, 289 (7.0%) had UTIs with colony counts ≥ 50000 CFUs/mL, including 27 (9.3%) with bacteremia. For these UTIs, a positive urinalysis exhibited sensitivities of 0.94 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.91–0.97), regardless of bacteremia; 1.00 (95% CI: 0.87–1.00) with bacteremia; and 0.94 (95% CI: 0.90–0.96) without bacteremia. Specificity was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.90–0.91) in all groups. For UTIs with colony counts ≥ 10000 CFUs/mL, the sensitivity of the urinalysis was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.83–0.90), and specificity was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.90–0.92).

Conclusions

The urinalysis is highly sensitive and specific for diagnosing UTIs, especially with ≥ 50000 CFUs/mL, in febrile infants ≤ 60 days old, and particularly for UTIs with associated bacteremia.

### Urine concentration and pyuria for identifying UTI in infants [^79f23fdc]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Varying urine white blood cell (WBC) thresholds have been recommended for the presumptive diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) among young infants. These thresholds have not been studied with newer automated urinalysis systems that analyze uncentrifuged urine that might be influenced by urine concentration. Our objective was to determine the optimal urine WBC threshold for UTI in young infants by using an automated urinalysis system, stratified by urine concentration.

Methods

Retrospective cross-sectional study of infants aged < 3 months evaluated for UTI in the emergency department with paired urinalysis and urine culture. UTI was defined as ≥ 50000 colony-forming units/mL from catheterized specimens. Test characteristics were calculated across a range of WBC and leukocyte esterase (LE) cut-points, dichotomized into specific gravity groups (dilute < 1.015; concentrated ≥ 1.015).

Results

Twenty-seven thousand infants with a median age of 1.7 months were studied. UTI prevalence was 7.8%. Optimal WBC cut-points were 3 WBC/high-power field (HPF) in dilute urine (likelihood ratio positive [LR+] 9.9, likelihood ratio negative [LR‒] 0.15) and 6 WBC/HPF (LR+ 10.1, LR‒ 0.17) in concentrated urine. For dipstick analysis, positive LE has excellent test characteristics regardless of urine concentration (LR+ 22.1, LR‒ 0.12 in dilute urine; LR+ 31.6, LR‒ 0.22 in concentrated urine).

Conclusions

Urine concentration should be incorporated into the interpretation of automated microscopic urinalysis in young infants. Pyuria thresholds of 3 WBC/HPF in dilute urine and 6 WBC/HPF in concentrated urine are recommended for the presumptive diagnosis of UTI. Without correction of specific gravity, positive LE by automated dipstick is a reliably strong indicator of UTI.

### Novel technologies for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections [^ed0ec4c3]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

THE CLINICAL LANDSCAPE OF URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS

An estimated 400 million urinary tract infections (UTIs) occur each year globally, with over 200,000 associated deaths, making UTIs one of the most common bacterial diseases and drivers of antimicrobial usage. UTIs disproportionately affect women, up to 60% of whom experience at least one UTI in their lifetime. This association is generally attributed to anatomy, although hormonal factors also play an increasingly recognized role, including in relation to the vaginal microbiome. Traditionally, a UTI is defined by clinical signs and symptoms such as urinary frequency, urgency, pelvic or lower abdominal pain, pyuria, or urinary incontinence — often in combination with identification of an offending pathogen via urine culture. This symptom-based approach to UTIs can lack sensitivity or specificity in certain populations, including the very young and elderly, or individuals who are chronically catheterized, with urologic or neurologic abnormalities. For these patients, signs and symptoms can be ambiguous.

### Top ten myths regarding the diagnosis and treatment of urinary Tract infections [^47e4a4df]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are the most common type of infection in the United States. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report in March 2014 regarding antibiotic use in hospitals reported "UTI" treatment was avoidable at least 39% of the time. The accurate diagnosis and treatment of UTI plays an important role in cost-effective medical care and appropriate antimicrobial utilization.

Objective

We summarize the most common misperceptions of UTI that result in extraneous testing and excessive antimicrobial treatment. We present 10 myths associated with the diagnosis and treatment of UTI and succinctly review the literature pertaining to each myth. We explore the myths associated with pyuria, asymptomatic bacteriuria, candiduria, and the elderly and catheterized patients. We attempt to give guidance for clinicians facing these clinical scenarios.

Discussion

From our ambulatory, emergency department, and hospital experiences, patients often have urine cultures ordered without an appropriate indication, or receive unnecessary antibiotic therapy due to over-interpretation of the urinalysis.

Conclusions

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is common in all age groups and is frequently over-treated. A UTI diagnosis should be based on a combination of clinical symptoms with supportive laboratory information. This review will assist providers in navigating common pitfalls in the diagnosis of UTI.

### Can urine dipstick testing for urinary tract infection at point of care reduce laboratory workload? [^3bd3980b]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

Aim

The University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust microbiology laboratory receives 150 000 urine samples each year, approximately 80% of which prove to be culture negative. The aim of this study was to reduce the proportion of culture negative urines arriving in the laboratory, by producing local evidence based guidelines for the use of urine dipstick testing at point of care within the trust's three acute hospitals.

Methods

One thousand and seventy six unborated urine samples were dipstick tested at the point of care using an automatic strip reader. Quantitative results for the four infection associated markers-leucocyte esterase, nitrite, blood, and protein-were compared with the results of conventional laboratory microscopy and culture.

Results

The performance of different marker combinations was calculated against the routine laboratory methods. One hundred and seventy five (16.3%) samples were negative for all four markers. Of these dipstick negative samples, only three (1.7% of all true positives) were positive by culture. The absence of all four infection associated markers was found to have a greater than 98% negative predictive value and a sensitivity and specificity of 98.3% and 19.2%, respectively.

Conclusions

A urinary dipstick testing algorithm for infection associated markers was derived for use in hospital patients to screen out negative urines. Two years after distributing the algorithm and promoting access to reagent strips and strip readers, a reduction in the urine workload has been seen against an otherwise increasing laboratory specimen load.

### Absolute and relative accuracy of rapid urine tests for urinary tract infection in children: a meta-analysis [^71ae27e8]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2010). Medium credibility.

Rapid urine tests, such as microscopy, for bacteria and white cells, and dipsticks, for leucocyte esterase and nitrites, are often used in children that are unwell to guide early diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infection. We aimed to establish whether these tests were sufficiently sensitive to avoid urine culture in children with negative results and to compare the accuracy of dipsticks with microscopy. Medline, Embase, and reference lists were searched. Studies were included if urine culture results were compared with rapid tests in children. Data were analysed to obtain absolute and relative accuracy estimates. Data from 95 studies in 95 703 children were analysed. Summary estimates for sensitivity and specificity for microscopy for Gram-stained bacteria were 91% (95% CI 80–96) and 96% (92–98), for unstained bacteria were 88% (75–94) and 92% (84–96), for urine white cells were 74% (67–80) and 86% (82–90), for leucocyte esterase or nitrite positive dipstick were 88% (82–91) and 79% (69–87), and for nitrite-only positive dipstick were 49% (41–57) and 98% (96–99). Microscopy for bacteria with Gram stain had higher accuracy than other laboratory tests with relative diagnostic odds ratio compared with bacteria without Gram stain of 8.7 (95% CI 1.8–41.1), white cells of 14.5 (4.7–44.4), and nitrite of 22.0 (0.7–746.3). Microscopy for white cells should not be used for the diagnosis of urinary tract infection because its accuracy is no better than that of dipstick, laboratory facilities are needed, and results are delayed. Rapid tests are negative in around 10% of children with a urinary tract infection and cannot replace urine culture. If resources allow, microscopy with Gram stain should be the single rapid test used.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^55b5409c]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — definition and diagnostic criteria emphasize that this Guideline supports the most commonly used definition of two episodes of acute bacterial cystitis within a six-month period sometime within the preceding year, and any patient experiencing episodes of symptomatic acute cystitis after previous resolution of similar symptoms meets the criteria for rUTI. Strong evidence suggests that the diagnosis of acute bacterial cystitis should include the combination of acute-onset symptoms referable to the urinary tract, urinary inflammation on microscopic urinalysis (pyuria), and laboratory confirmation of significant bacteriuria, with Table 1 detailing components such as acute-onset symptoms including dysuria with increased urgency and frequency, hematuria, and new or worsening incontinence; urinary tract inflammation defined as pyuria ≥ 5 WBC/high power field (hpf) on microscopic urinalysis; and detection of a bacterial uropathogen. Without symptoms, bacteriuria of any magnitude is considered asymptomatic bacteriuria, and patients who recur rapidly within two weeks of initial treatment or who display bacterial persistence without symptom resolution may require imaging, cystoscopy, or other further investigation for bacterial reservoirs.

### Urine flow cytometry in older adults urinary tract infection diagnosis: is it time to reevaluate thresholds for men and women? [^42b7577a]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Performance of urine dipstick

We collected the results of a total of 417 urine dipsticks (91.4%) performed in the emergency department, including 66 for the UTI group (95.6%) and 351 for the control group (90.7%). Urine dipsticks were considered negative if leukocyte esterase and nitrite were negative (AUC = 0.7405 [0.706–0.775]) and positive otherwise (Table S5). Sensitivity of urine dipstick for UTI (95.45% [87.47–98.44]) was lower than the sensitivity of UBC threshold of 150 bacteria/µL (98.48% [91.90–99.79]) (p < 0.01) but similar to the sensitivity of the U-WBC threshold of 50 leukocytes (95.45% [87.47–98.44]) (p < 0.99). However, specificity was higher for both the UBC threshold of 150 bacteria/µL (67.81% [62.75–72.48]) and the U-WBC threshold of 50 leukocytes (70.66% [65.69–75.17]) compared to the specificity of the urine dipstick (57.83% [52.61–62.89]) (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively). The LR- was < 0.1 for all test methods. Urine dipstick in patients with at least one major symptom had a sensitivity of 91.43% [77.62–97.04], a specificity of 73.08% [53.92–86.30], a LR- of 0.117 [0.059–0.234] and a LR + of 3.396 [2.55–4.42].

### UTI and faulty gold standards… [^64a36153]. publications.aap.org (2017). Low credibility.

I read with interest the article by Shaikh et al 1 on the association between pyuria and uropathogen type in children being evaluated for urinary tract infection. Their conclusion differs from our related investigation 2 in Pediatrics, in which we concluded that the sensitivity of the urinalysis has been previously underestimated due to a faulty gold standard, namely, urine cultures that are falsely positive because of contamination and asymptomatic bacteruria. In our sample of young infants with bacteremic UTI, a condition that cannot be explained by contamination or AB, 99. 5% of subjects had a UA that was positive for either leukocyte esterase or pyuria. 2 The accompanying commentary to our article concluded that "the absence of pyuria should create great doubt about the presence of a UTI. " 3 In this recent investigation, Shaikh et al 1 present data consistent. Comments
