## Question

What are the first-line pharmacological agents for managing diabetes and hypertension?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the first-line pharmacological agents for managing diabetes and hypertension. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical context and scope, including type of diabetes and whether hypertension is already present. Then, I should verify the first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes and whether metformin remains foundational. Next, I will examine first-line antihypertensive choices in diabetes, including thresholds, targets, and special indications like albuminuria or CKD. After that, I should consider population-specific nuances such as race/ethnicity and older adults. Finally, I will integrate combination strategies, monitoring, and a concise synthesis that aligns with major guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and scope so I don't jump to conclusions. The question spans two conditions: diabetes management and hypertension management, and it implies patients with coexisting diabetes and hypertension, which is common and carries elevated cardiovascular risk, so I need to ensure recommendations reflect both glycemic and blood pressure targets and outcomes data in this population [^16b30200].

> Now, for type 2 diabetes, I should confirm whether metformin remains first-line. Wait, let me verify the most current consensus: yes, metformin is still the preferred initial pharmacologic therapy unless contraindicated or not tolerated, owing to efficacy, safety, mortality signals in observational cohorts, and low cost; this is supported by ADA and AAFP positions and remains standard despite the emergence of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists with cardiorenal benefits, which are often added rather than replacing metformin initially [^c75549e5] [^0dd2a8a8].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists as first-line in special circumstances. In patients with established ASCVD or high cardiovascular risk, or with CKD, guidelines endorse considering SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists independent of baseline A1C, sometimes even as first-line in very high-risk phenotypes; this is a complication-centric evolution rather than a blanket replacement of metformin for all [^c75549e5] [^030e3b62].

> Next, I will examine hypertension management in diabetes, starting with thresholds and targets. I need to ensure I'm aligned with ADA and ACC/AHA: pharmacologic therapy should be initiated at ≥ 130/80 mmHg with a treatment goal of < 130/80 mmHg if safely attainable, and for those with ≥ 150/90 mmHg, prompt initiation of two agents is recommended to improve likelihood of reaching target; this is consistent with ADA 2025 and contemporary ACC/AHA guidance [^eb1569c6] [^3a15de04] [^66f28e39].

> I will now examine first-line antihypertensive classes. Let me think about the core options: thiazide-type diuretics, long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, and ARBs are all acceptable first-line choices for people with diabetes; however, ACE inhibitors or ARBs are preferred when albuminuria is present or when there is CKD, given their renoprotective effects and cardiovascular benefit in that context [^d2e316fe] [^288a2535] [^66f28e39].

> But wait, what if the patient is Black and has diabetes? I should double-check race-specific guidance. JNC 8 and subsequent analyses support choosing a thiazide-type diuretic or a calcium channel blocker as initial therapy in Black patients, including those with diabetes, due to observed differences in stroke and blood pressure response; ACE inhibitors or ARBs are still appropriate when albuminuria or CKD is present, and dual therapy is often needed to reach targets [^6aaf7f16] [^083a9f8b] [^428ab060].

> Let me consider older adults with diabetes and hypertension. The Endocrine Society recommends ACE inhibitors or ARBs as first-line in patients aged 65 and older with diabetes and hypertension, with careful attention to orthostatic hypotension and renal function; if blood pressure is ≥ 160/100 mmHg, starting two drugs is reasonable, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists can be considered for resistant hypertension after three classes including a diuretic [^c0535cc7] [^c1953a41].

> I should confirm combination strategies and single-pill combinations. For patients with initial blood pressure ≥ 150/90 mmHg, starting two complementary agents is advised, and single-pill combinations can improve adherence; common and evidence-aligned combinations include an ACE inhibitor or ARB with a calcium channel blocker or a thiazide-like diuretic, while avoiding ACE inhibitor plus ARB combinations due to harm [^d4f927ea] [^3a15de04] [^45b9402e].

> Next, I should review monitoring and safety. I need to ensure we check serum creatinine and potassium within 1–2 weeks after initiating or uptitrating ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or diuretics, and then periodically, given risks of hyperkalemia and kidney function decline; this is standard in diabetes care pathways and is emphasized in ADA guidance [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize succinctly so I don't miss anything critical. For type 2 diabetes, metformin remains first-line unless contraindicated, with SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists prioritized when ASCVD or CKD are present or risk is very high. For hypertension in diabetes, initiate pharmacotherapy at ≥ 130/80 mmHg targeting < 130/80 mmHg if safe, start two agents if ≥ 150/90 mmHg, and choose among thiazide diuretics, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, or ARBs, favoring ACE inhibitors or ARBs when albuminuria or CKD is present; tailor initial choice by race/ethnicity and comorbidity, and escalate promptly to combination therapy as needed [^c75549e5] [^eb1569c6] [^d2e316fe] [^6aaf7f16].

---

First-line pharmacological therapy for diabetes is **metformin** unless contraindicated, with SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists as preferred add-ons in patients with ASCVD, heart failure, or CKD [^c75549e5] [^f257ace0]. For hypertension in diabetes, **ACE inhibitors or ARBs are first-line** [^d2e316fe], especially with albuminuria or CKD, and thiazide diuretics or calcium channel blockers are appropriate alternatives when ACE inhibitors/ARBs are not tolerated or as part of combination therapy [^9bca5e2a] [^3a15de04]. Combination therapy is often required to reach blood pressure targets, and dual therapy is recommended when initial blood pressure is ≥ 150/90 mmHg [^d32234e9] [^2f899588].

## First-line pharmacological therapy for diabetes

### Metformin

- **Mechanism of action**: Reduces hepatic glucose production and improves insulin sensitivity.
- **Clinical evidence**: Reduces A1C by ~1%, lowers cardiovascular events, and is associated with weight neutrality or loss.
- **Guideline support**: ADA 2025 and AACE 2023 recommend metformin as first-line unless contraindicated (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or intolerance) [^c75549e5].

---

### Alternative first-line options in specific populations

In patients with established ASCVD or high risk, **SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists** are recommended regardless of A1C, given their cardiovascular and renal benefits [^c75549e5] [^f257ace0]. In older adults or those with multiple comorbidities, **individualized therapy** may prioritize agents with low hypoglycemia risk and favorable cardiorenal profiles [^c1953a41].

---

## First-line pharmacological therapy for hypertension in diabetes

### ACE inhibitors and ARBs

- **Mechanism of action**: Block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, reducing intraglomerular pressure and proteinuria.
- **Clinical evidence**: Reduce progression of diabetic kidney disease and cardiovascular events, especially in the presence of albuminuria or CKD [^d2e316fe] [^288a2535].
- **Guideline support**: ADA 2025 and ACC/AHA 2025 recommend ACE inhibitors or ARBs as first-line in diabetes, particularly with albuminuria or CKD [^d2e316fe] [^66f28e39].

---

### Thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers

Thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers are **appropriate alternatives** when ACE inhibitors/ARBs are not tolerated or as part of combination therapy [^9bca5e2a]. Thiazide diuretics are effective for blood pressure lowering and have favorable metabolic profiles at low doses, while calcium channel blockers are effective and well tolerated, particularly in older adults or Black patients [^6aaf7f16] [^b79ae637].

---

## Combination therapy

Combination therapy is often required to achieve blood pressure targets; **dual therapy is recommended** when initial blood pressure is ≥ 150/90 mmHg, typically with an ACE inhibitor or ARB plus a calcium channel blocker or thiazide diuretic [^d32234e9] [^2f899588]. Single-pill combinations can improve adherence and facilitate faster blood pressure control [^b1623a3f].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Condition** | **First-line pharmacological therapy** | **Alternative/add-on therapy** |
|-|-|-|
| Diabetes | Metformin | - SGLT2 inhibitors <br/> - GLP-1 receptor agonists (if ASCVD, HF, or CKD) |
| Hypertension in diabetes | - ACE inhibitors <br/> - ARBs | - Thiazide diuretics <br/> - Calcium channel blockers <br/> - Combination therapy |

---

Metformin remains the **first-line pharmacological therapy for diabetes**, while **ACE inhibitors or ARBs are first-line for hypertension in diabetes**, with thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers as alternatives or adjuncts. Combination therapy is frequently needed to achieve blood pressure targets.

### First-line combination therapy versus first-line monotherapy for primary hypertension [^69f07091]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Starting with one drug and starting with a combination of two drugs are strategies suggested in clinical guidelines as initial treatment of hypertension. The recommendations are not based on evidence about clinically relevant outcomes. Some antihypertensive combinations have been shown to be harmful. The actual harm-to-benefit balance of each strategy is unknown.

Objectives

To determine if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the Hypertension Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2016, Issue 2), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) up to February 2016. We searched in clinical studies repositories of pharmaceutical companies, reviews of combination drugs in Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency, and lists of references in reviews and clinical practice guidelines.

Selection Criteria

Randomized, double-blind trials with at least 12 months' follow-up in adults with primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure 140/90 mmHg or higher, or 130/80 mmHg or higher if participants had diabetes), which compared combination of two first-line antihypertensive drug with monotherapy as initial treatment. Trials had to include at least 50 participants per group and report mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events or serious adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion, evaluated the risk of bias and entered the data. Primary outcomes were mortality, serious adverse events, cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality. Secondary outcomes were withdrawals due to drug-related adverse effects, reaching blood pressure control (as defined in each trial) and blood pressure change from baseline. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. We summarized data on dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals.

Main Results

We found three studies in which a subgroup of participants met our inclusion criteria. None of the studies focused solely on people initiating antihypertensive treatment so we asked investigators for data for this subgroup (monotherapy: 335 participants; combination therapy: 233 participants). They included outpatients, and mostly European and white people. Two trials included only people with type 2 diabetes, whereas the other trial excluded people treated with diabetes, hypocholesterolaemia or cardiovascular drugs. The follow-up was 12 months in two trials and 36 months in one trial. Certainty of evidence was very low due to the serious imprecision, and for using a subgroup not defined in advance. Confidence intervals were extremely wide for all important outcomes and included both appreciable harm and benefit.

Authors' Conclusions

The numbers of included participants and, hence the number of events, were too small to draw any conclusion about the relative efficacy of monotherapy versus combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension. There is a need for large clinical trials that address the question and report clinically relevant endpoints.

### First-line combination therapy versus first-line monotherapy for primary hypertension [^ac07c61d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the first update of a review originally published in 2017. Starting with one drug and starting with a combination of two drugs are strategies suggested in clinical guidelines as initial treatment of hypertension. The recommendations are not based on evidence about clinically relevant outcomes. Some antihypertensive combinations have been shown to be harmful. The actual harm-to-benefit balance of each strategy is unknown.

Objectives

To determine if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to April 2019: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 2005), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We used no language restrictions. We also searched clinical studies repositories of pharmaceutical companies, reviews of combination drugs on the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency websites, and lists of references in reviews and clinical practice guidelines.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind trials with at least 12 months' follow-up in adults with primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure 140/90 mmHg or higher, or 130/80 mmHg or higher if participants had diabetes), which compared combination of two first-line antihypertensive drugs with monotherapy as initial treatment. Trials had to include at least 50 participants per group and report mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events, or serious adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, evaluated the risk of bias, and performed data entry. The primary outcomes were mortality, serious adverse events, cardiovascular events, and cardiovascular mortality. Secondary outcomes were withdrawals due to drug-related adverse effects, reaching blood pressure control (as defined in each trial), and blood pressure change from baseline. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. We summarised data on dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

This update included one new study in which a subgroup of participants met our inclusion criteria. As none of the four included studies focused solely on people initiating antihypertensive treatment, we asked investigators for data for this subgroup. One study (PREVER-treatment 2016) used a combination of thiazide-type diuretic/potassium-sparing diuretic; as the former is not indicated in monotherapy, we analysed this study separately. The three original trials in the main comparison (monotherapy: 335 participants; combination therapy: 233 participants) included outpatients, mostly European and white people. Two trials only included people with type 2 diabetes; the remaining trial excluded people treated with diabetes, hypocholesterolaemia, or cardiovascular drugs. The follow-up was 12 months in two trials and 36 months in one trial. It is very uncertain whether combination therapy versus monotherapy reduces total mortality (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.08 to 21.72), cardiovascular mortality (zero events reported), cardiovascular events (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.22 to 4.41), serious adverse events (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.92), or withdrawals due to adverse effects (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.35); all outcomes had 568 participants, and the evidence was rated as of very low certainty due to serious imprecision and for using a subgroup that was not defined in advance. The confidence intervals were extremely wide for all important outcomes and included both appreciable harm and benefit. The PREVER-treatment 2016 trial, which used a combination therapy with potassium-sparing diuretic (monotherapy: 84 participants; combination therapy: 116 participants), included outpatients. This trial was conducted in Brazil and had a follow-up of 18 months. The number of events was very low and confidence intervals very wide, with zero events reported for cardiovascular mortality and withdrawals due to adverse events. It is very uncertain if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy in this trial.

Authors' Conclusions

The numbers of included participants, and hence the number of events, were too small to draw any conclusion about the relative efficacy of monotherapy versus combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension. There is a need for large clinical trials that address the review question and report clinically relevant endpoints.

### Blood pressure guidelines-where are we now? [^bccd41ad]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2008). Low credibility.

In June 2006, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) updated its recommendations on the management of patients with hypertension (published in 2004), in light of "significant new data" relating to drug treatment.1,2 The update, published in collaboration with the British Hypertension Society (BHS), recommended first-line use of a calcium-channel blocker or a thiazide-type diuretic in patients aged over 55 years or an ACE inhibitor in those aged under 55 years, and advised that beta-blockers should no longer be used for routine initial therapy.1 Recently published data from England suggest that primary care prescribing has changed in line with this new guideline.3 However, interpretation of the evidence that underpins some of the key recommendations is open to debate, particularly as there are differences from some other major guidelines in the recommendations for first-line therapy. Here we consider the updated NICE guideline, the rationale for its treatment recommendations, and the subsequent change in clinical practice. In particular, we focus on the initial drug management of adults without conditions such as diabetes mellitus or coronary heart disease that would in themselves be a key determinant of management.

### Treatment of hypertension in type 2 diabetes mellitus: blood pressure goals, choice of agents, and setting priorities in diabetes care [^6b016aee]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus is a prevalent condition that leads to substantial morbidity and mortality.

Purpose

To evaluate the goals and optimal agents for treatment of hypertension in type 2 diabetes.

Data Sources

Review of the medical literature

Study Selection

Randomized trials that evaluated the pharmacologic treatment of hypertension in patients with diabetes and reported microvascular and macrovascular outcomes.

Data Extraction

Studies were identified by using the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, meta-analyses, review articles, and expert recommendation. The searches of the Cochrane Library and MEDLINE were performed in May 2000 and updated in April 2002. Data were abstracted to standardized forms by a single reviewer and were confirmed by a second reviewer.

Data Synthesis

Treatment of hypertension in type 2 diabetes provides dramatic benefit. Target diastolic blood pressures of less than 80 mm Hg appear optimal; systolic targets have not been as rigorously evaluated, but targets of 135 mm Hg or less are reasonable. Studies that compare drug classes do not suggest obviously superior agents. However, it is reasonable to conclude that thiazide diuretics, angiotensin-II receptor blockers, and perhaps angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may be the preferred first-line agents for treatment of hypertension in diabetes. beta-Blockers and calcium-channel blockers are more effective than placebo, but they may not be as effective as diuretics, angiotensin-II receptor blockers, or ACE inhibitors; however, study results are inconsistent in this regard.

Conclusions

Treatment of hypertension in type 2 diabetes, with blood pressure goals of 135/80 mm Hg, provides dramatic benefits. Thiazide diuretics, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and ACE inhibitors may be the best first-line treatments, although other agents are usually necessary and goals may not be achieved even with three or four agents. Aggressive blood pressure control may be the most important factor in preventing adverse outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes.

### First-line drugs inhibiting the renin angiotensin system versus other first-line antihypertensive drug classes for hypertension [^c19b7b13]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This is the first update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2015. Renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors include angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and renin inhibitors. They are widely prescribed for treatment of hypertension, especially for people with diabetes because of postulated advantages for reducing diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite widespread use for hypertension, the efficacy and safety of RAS inhibitors compared to other antihypertensive drug classes remains unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of first-line RAS inhibitors compared to other first-line antihypertensive drugs in people with hypertension.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Group Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized, active-controlled, double-blinded studies (RCTs) with at least six months follow-up in people with elevated blood pressure (≥ 130/85 mmHg), which compared first-line RAS inhibitors with other first-line antihypertensive drug classes and reported morbidity and mortality or blood pressure outcomes. We excluded people with proven secondary hypertension.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected the included trials, evaluated the risks of bias and entered the data for analysis.

Main Results

This update includes three new RCTs, totaling 45 in all, involving 66,625 participants, with a mean age of 66 years. Much of the evidence for our key outcomes is dominated by a small number of large RCTs at low risk for most sources of bias. Imbalances in the added second-line antihypertensive drugs in some of the studies were important enough for us to downgrade the quality of the evidence. Primary outcomes were all-cause death, fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal and non-fatal congestive heart failure (CHF) requiring hospitalizations, total cardiovascular (CV) events (fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal MI and fatal and non-fatal CHF requiring hospitalization), and end-stage renal failure (ESRF). Secondary outcomes were systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR). Compared with first-line calcium channel blockers (CCBs), we found moderate-certainty evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors decreased heart failure (HF) (35,143 participants in 5 RCTs, risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 0.90, absolute risk reduction (ARR) 1.2%), and that they increased stroke (34,673 participants in 4 RCTs, RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.32, absolute risk increase (ARI) 0.7%). Moderate-certainty evidence showed that first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line CCBs did not differ for all-cause death (35,226 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.09); total CV events (35,223 participants in 6 RCTs, RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.02); and total MI (35,043 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.09). Low-certainty evidence suggests they did not differ for ESRF (19,551 participants in 4 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.05). Compared with first-line thiazides, we found moderate-certainty evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors increased HF (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.31, ARI 1.0%), and increased stroke (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.28, ARI 0.6%). Moderate-certainty evidence showed that first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line thiazides did not differ for all-cause death (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.07); total CV events (24,379 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.11); and total MI (24,379 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.01). Low-certainty evidence suggests they did not differ for ESRF (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.37). Compared with first-line beta-blockers, low-certainty evidence suggests that first-line RAS inhibitors decreased total CV events (9239 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.98, ARR 1.7%), and decreased stroke (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.88, ARR 1.7%). Low-certainty evidence suggests that first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line beta-blockers did not differ for all-cause death (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.01); HF (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.18); and total MI (9239 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.27). Blood pressure comparisons between first-line RAS inhibitors and other first-line classes showed either no differences or small differences that did not necessarily correlate with the differences in the morbidity outcomes. There is no information about non-fatal serious adverse events, as none of the trials reported this outcome.

Authors' Conclusions

All-cause death is similar for first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line CCBs, thiazides and beta-blockers. There are, however, differences for some morbidity outcomes. First-line thiazides caused less HF and stroke than first-line RAS inhibitors. First-line CCBs increased HF but decreased stroke compared to first-line RAS inhibitors. The magnitude of the increase in HF exceeded the decrease in stroke. Low-quality evidence suggests that first-line RAS inhibitors reduced stroke and total CV events compared to first-line beta-blockers. The small differences in effect on blood pressure between the different classes of drugs did not correlate with the differences in the morbidity outcomes.

AACE 2023 type 2 diabetes hypertension targets and treatment recommend that AACE has set a specific BP goal for the majority of adults with T2D as < 130 mm Hg with a diastolic BP goal of < 80 mm Hg, with a lower target considered for persons with micro- or macroalbuminuria, moderate/high risk for or with established ASCVD, peripheral vascular disease, or retinopathy, and recognition that some persons with T2D may not tolerate a goal of < 130/80 mm Hg. Lifestyle therapy is part of initial management, as exercise several times per week is important because there are reductions in both systolic and diastolic BP with endurance and dynamic resistance training, and Mediterranean diets have been demonstrated to lower BP. Pharmacologic therapy specifies that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are considered first-line therapies for HTN in persons with T2D, particularly in those with DKD; there is no additional benefit for coadministration of an ACEI and an ARB together, and combination may cause harm, an ARB can substitute for ACEI intolerance, and if the initial BP is > 150/100 mm Hg, dual therapy may need to be used at the outset.

### JNC 8 guidelines for the management of hypertension in… [^5d59f71b]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- In the general population, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg or higher in adults 60 years and older, or 140/90 mm Hg or higher in adults younger than 60 years.
- In patients with hypertension and diabetes, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg or higher, regardless of age.
- Initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide diuretic, calcium channel blocker, ACE inhibitor, or ARB in the general nonblack population or a thiazide diuretic or calcium channel blocker in the general black population.
- If the target blood pressure is not reached within one month after initiating therapy, the dosage of the initial medication should be increased, or a second medication should be added.

From the AFP Editors Hypertension is one of the most important preventable contributors to disease and death in the United States, leading to myocardial infarction, stroke, and renal failure when it is not detected early and treated appropriately. The Eighth Joint National Committee recently released evidence-based recommendations on treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults. Pharmacologic Treatment In the general nonblack population, including those with diabetes, initial anti-hypertensive treatment should include a thiazide diuretic, calcium channel blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or angiotensin receptor blocker. In the general black population, including those with diabetes, initial treatment should include a thiazide diuretic or calcium channel blocker.

If the target blood pressure is not reached within one month after initiating therapy, the dosage of the initial medication should be increased or a second medication should be added. Blood pressure should be monitored and the treatment regimen adjusted until the target blood pressure is reached. Adults with CKD and hypertension should receive an ACE inhibitor or ARB as initial or add-on therapy, based on moderate evidence that these medications improve kidney-related outcomes in these patients.

Recommendation 6 — initial antihypertensive therapy in adults: In the general population, including those with diabetes, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide-type diuretic, calcium channel blocker (CCB), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). Moderate Recommendation – Grade B. For this recommendation, only RCTs that compared one class of antihypertensive medication to another and assessed the effects on health outcomes were reviewed; placebo-controlled RCTs were not included. Each of the 4 drug classes recommended by the panel in recommendation 6 yielded comparable effects on overall mortality and cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and kidney outcomes, with one exception: heart failure. Initial treatment with a thiazide-type diuretic was more effective than a CCB or ACEI, and an ARB was more effective than a CCB in improving heart failure outcomes. The panel also acknowledged that the evidence supported BP control, rather than a specific agent to be used to achieve that control, as the most consistent determinant for risk reduction. β-Blockers were not recommended as first-line therapy because in one study initial treatment with a β-blocker resulted in a higher rate of the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke compared to use of an ARB, a finding that was driven largely by an increase in stroke. Similar to those in the general population, this recommendation applies to those with diabetes because trials including participants with diabetes showed no differences in major cardiovascular or cerebrovascular outcomes from those in the general population.

### First-line drugs inhibiting the renin angiotensin system versus other first-line antihypertensive drug classes for hypertension [^771cfcc4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors are widely prescribed for treatment of hypertension, especially for diabetic patients on the basis of postulated advantages for the reduction of diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite widespread use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) for hypertension in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients, the efficacy and safety of RAS inhibitors compared to other antihypertensive drug classes remains unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of first-line RAS inhibitors compared to other first-line antihypertensive drugs in patients with hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials up to November 19, 2014 and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to October 19, 2014. The WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) is searched for inclusion in the Cochrane Hypertension Group's Specialised Register.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized, active-controlled, double-blinded studies with at least six months follow-up in people with primary elevated blood pressure (≥ 130/85 mmHg), which compared first-line RAS inhibitors with other first-line antihypertensive drug classes and reported morbidity and mortality or blood pressure outcomes. Patients with proven secondary hypertension were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected the included trials, evaluated the risk of bias and entered the data for analysis.

Main Results

We included 42 studies, involving 65,733 participants, with a mean age of 66 years. Much of the evidence for our key outcomes is dominated by a small number of large studies at a low risk of bias for most sources of bias. Imbalances in the added second-line antihypertensive drugs in some of the studies were important enough for us to downgrade the quality of the evidence. Primary outcomes were all-cause death, fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal and non-fatal congestive heart failure (CHF) requiring hospitalization, total cardiovascular (CV) events (consisted of fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal MI and fatal and non-fatal CHF requiring hospitalizations), and ESRF. Secondary outcomes were systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR). Compared with first-line calcium channel blockers (CCBs), we found moderate quality evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors decreased heart failure (HF) (35,143 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.90, ARR 1.2%), and moderate quality evidence that they increased stroke (34,673 participants in 4 RCTs, RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.32, ARI 0.7%). They had similar effects on all-cause death (35,226 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.09; moderate quality evidence), total CV events (35,223 participants in 6 RCTs, RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.02; moderate quality evidence), total MI (35,043 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.09; moderate quality evidence). The results for ESRF do not exclude potentially important differences (19,551 participants in 4 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.05; low quality evidence). Compared with first-line thiazides, we found moderate quality evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors increased HF (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.31, ARI 1.0%), and increased stroke (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.28, ARI 0.6%). They had similar effects on all-cause death (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.07; moderate quality evidence), total CV events (24,379 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.11; moderate quality evidence), and total MI (24,379 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.01; moderate quality evidence). Results for ESRF do not exclude potentially important differences (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.37; low quality evidence). Compared with first-line beta-blockers, we found low quality evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors decreased total CV events (9239 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.98, ARR 1.7%), and low quality evidence that they decreased stroke (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.88, ARR 1.7%). Our analyses do not exclude potentially important differences between first-line RAS inhibitors and beta-blockers on all-cause death (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.01; low quality evidence), HF (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.18; low quality evidence), and total MI (9239 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.27; low quality evidence). Blood pressure comparisons between RAS inhibitors and other classes showed either no differences or small differences that did not necessarily correlate with the differences in the morbidity outcomes. In the protocol, we identified non-fatal serious adverse events (SAE) as a primary outcome. However, when we extracted the data from included studies, none of them reported total SAE in a manner that could be used in the review. Therefore, there is no information about SAE in the review.

Authors' Conclusions

We found predominantly moderate quality evidence that all-cause mortality is similar when first-line RAS inhibitors are compared to other first-line antihypertensive agents. First-line thiazides caused less HF and stroke than first-line RAS inhibitors. The quality of the evidence comparing first-line beta-blockers and first-line RAS inhibitors was low and the lower risk of total CV events and stroke seen with RAS inhibitors may change with the publication of additional trials. Compared with first-line CCBs, first-line RAS inhibitors reduced HF but increased stroke. The magnitude of the reduction in HF exceeded the increase in stroke. The small differences in effect on blood pressure between the different classes of drugs did not correlate with the differences in the primary outcomes.

### Management of diabetes and hypertension within the gulf region: updates on treatment practices and therapies [^7202b788]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

For patients with T2D, early sustained glycaemic control is essential for the prevention of macrovascular and microvascular complications. Similarly, in patients with hypertension, BP reductions can prevent cardiovascular complications.

The glucose-lowering effects of the later-generation SUs are similar to those of older SUs, but these newer agents such as gliclazide MR have the advantages of a lower incidence of hypoglycaemia with no risk of cardiovascular events and proven renal benefits. Within the various clinical guidelines, including the GCC consensus, gliclazide MR is recommended as one of the best options for second-line treatment after metformin in patients with no known cardiovascular and renal diseases.

For patients with hypertension, a stepwise approach should be used when starting anti-hypertensive medication, with either an ACEi or CCB, depending on age and presence of associated risk factors, suggested as a first-line treatment owing to the lower risk of adverse cardiovascular events. For combination treatment, SPCs have been shown to improve adherence, and CCBs and diuretics in combination with an ACEi can successfully lower BP in patients with severe hypertension.

### Treatment of diabetes in older adults: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^c0535cc7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Hypertension management in older adults with diabetes — In patients aged 65 years and older with diabetes and hypertension, we recommend that an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker should be the first-line therapy, and Technical remark: If one class is not tolerated, the other should be substituted. Therefore, ACE inhibitors and ARBs should be the first-line therapy used for the treatment of hypertension in older patients with diabetes and should be included when more than one medication is needed, and these two drug classes should not be used together, especially in patients with CKD, due to increased risks of hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury. Two drugs should be started together if the initial BP is ≥ 160/100 mm Hg. Because hypertension involves a volume component in many patients with diabetes, a thiazide diuretic is commonly recommended as the third drug unless the eGFR is ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m², in which case a loop diuretic might be more appropriate. If coronary artery disease is significant, a beta-blocker may be appropriate and can be added as a fourth drug to a prior three-drug regimen; if a beta-blocker is used, carvedilol has been shown to have fewer metabolic effects than metoprolol. Notably, when BP is not controlled with three or more medications, referral to a hypertension specialist is indicated.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Diabetes (type 2 diabetes [T2D]) with hypertension — treatment initiation thresholds, targets, and drug classes are specified as follows: In adults with T2D and hypertension, antihypertensive drug treatment should be initiated at an SBP of ≥ 130 mm Hg with a treatment goal of < 130 mm Hg, with encouragement to achieve an SBP < 120 mm Hg to reduce CVD morbidity and mortality. In adults with T2D and hypertension, antihypertensive drug treatment should be initiated at a DBP of ≥ 80 mm Hg with a treatment goal of < 80 mm Hg to reduce CVD morbidity and mortality. In adults with T2D and hypertension, all first-line classes of antihypertensive agents (ie, thiazide-type diuretics, long-acting CCB, ACEi, and ARB) are useful and effective for BP lowering. In adults with diabetes and hypertension, ACEi or ARB are recommended in the presence of CKD as identified by eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² or albuminuria ≥ 30 mg/g.

### Achievement of recommended glucose and blood pressure targets in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension in clinical practice-study rationale and protocol of DIALOGUE [^daf042a8]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with type 2 diabetes have 2–4 times greater risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than those without, and this is even further aggravated if they also suffer from hypertension. Unfortunately, less than one third of hypertensive diabetic patients meet blood pressure targets, and more than half fail to achieve target HbA1c values. Thus, appropriate blood pressure and glucose control are of utmost importance. Since treatment sometimes fails in clinical practice while clinical trials generally suggest good efficacy, data from daily clinical practice, especially with regard to the use of newly developed anti-diabetic and anti-hypertensive compounds in unselected patient populations, are essential. The DIALOGUE registry aims to close this important gap by evaluating different treatment approaches in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients with respect to their effectiveness and tolerability and their impact on outcomes. In addition, DIALOGUE is the first registry to determine treatment success based on the new individualized treatment targets recommended by the ADA and the EASD.

Methods

DIALOGUE is a prospective observational German multicentre registry and will enrol 10,000 patients with both diabetes and hypertension in up to 700 sites. After a baseline visit, further documentations are scheduled at 6, 12 and 24 months. There are two co-primary objectives referring to the most recent guidelines for the treatment of diabetes and hypertension: 1) individual HbA1c goal achievement with respect to anti-diabetic pharmacotherapy and 2) individual blood pressure goal achievement with different antihypertensive treatments. Among the secondary objectives the rate of major cardio-vascular and cerebro-vascular events (MACCE) and the rate of hospitalizations are the most important.

Conclusion

The registry will be able to gain insights into the reasons for the obvious gap between the demonstrated efficacy and safety of anti-diabetic and anti-hypertensive drugs in clinical trials and their real world balance of effectiveness and safety.

### Blood pressure management in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^f0c9dd09]. Hypertension Research (2017). Low credibility.

Hypertension aggravates macrovascular and microvascular diseases and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The current Japanese Society of Hypertension Guidelines of the Management of Hypertension (JSH 2014) recommends that antihypertensive medication should be initiated concomitantly with lifestyle modification when blood pressure (BP) is ⩾130/80mmHg and that target levels of office and home BP should be < 130/80mmHg and < 125/75mmHg, respectively, in T2DM patients. Considering more favorable metabolic profiles and renoprotective effects than other classes of antihypertensive agents, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers are recommended as the first-line therapy for patients with hypertension and T2DM in JSH 2014. However, the target BP and the first-line therapy remain controversial because of the paucity of high-quality evidence with consistency. It is suggested that BP management should be tailored for each patient with T2DM, based on tolerability and considerations of comorbidity.

### Management of hypertension in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: guidelines based on current evidence [^72766150]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Hypertension and diabetes are becoming increasingly common. Most patients with both disorders have a markedly worsened risk for premature microvascular and macrovascular complications. The appropriate management of the hypertension seen in almost 70% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus remains controversial. However, over the past few years, many randomized, controlled trials have provided guidance for more effective therapy. These trials have established the need for a lower goal blood pressure (< 130/80 mm Hg) than has previously been recommended. In addition, they have proven the efficacy of drugs from three major classes of antihypertensive agents; however, comparative trials have failed to show definite superiority of any particular class in either lowering blood pressure or reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. To achieve therapy goals, multiple antihypertensive drugs are usually needed. On the basis of their apparent superiority in slowing diabetic nephropathy, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should probably be the first choice. Second and third choices should be a long-acting diuretic and a calcium-channel blocker or a beta-blocker, respectively. Attention should also be directed toward nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic control of hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia.

### A practical approach to hypertension management in diabetes [^780bff5e]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Hypertension is one of the most important comorbidities of diabetes, contributing significantly to death and disability and leads to macrovascular and microvascular complications. When assessing the medical priorities for patients with diabetes, treating hypertension should be a primary consideration. Practical approaches to hypertension in diabetes, including individualized targets are discussed, as per stage and complication of diabetes, according to current studies and guidelines. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI)/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are the most effective drugs for treating hypertension in diabetes, in the absence of contraindications. Calcium antagonists or diuretics are acceptable as second-line agents. Once the target is achieved, antihypertensive drugs should be continued. Newer antidiabetes medications such as sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RA), and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) have antihypertensive properties and may assist in treatment decision-making.

### What is a preferred angiotensin II receptor blocker-based combination therapy for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with diabetic and non-diabetic renal impairment? [^4108b39e]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is a highly prevalent disease with a major associated risk for cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality. The majority of patients with hypertension require more than one antihypertensive agent to achieve and maintain guideline-recommended blood pressure (BP) goals. Identifying the most appropriate combination therapy for each patient based on individual risk factors and comorbidities is important for risk management. Increasingly, single-pill combinations (SPCs) containing two or more antihypertensive agents with complementary mechanisms of action are available. These offer potential advantages, including simplification of treatment regimens, more convenient drug administration and reduced healthcare costs. Evidence from meta-analyses has shown that the use of antihypertensive SPCs compared with corresponding free-drug combinations is associated with significantly greater rates of treatment adherence to medication and potential advantages in terms of BP improvements and adverse effects. A large retrospective database study of an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) plus a calcium channel blocker (CCB) in two-drug SPCs has also shown greater levels of adherence compared with the corresponding free-pill ARB/CCB regimens. Treatment adherence is an important issue for a chronic disease such as hypertension, with improvements in adherence expected to result in better long-term clinical outcomes, including reduced CV and renal morbidity/mortality. This review will consider the choice of agents for combination therapy using two-drug SPCs and the rationale for using particular combinations in patients with hypertension and renal impairment.

Why should early combination therapy be considered?

Worldwide guidelines recommend combination therapy as a first-line treatment option for hypertension likely not to be controlled on monotherapy (e.g. 20/10 mmHg above target BP) because of evidence showing that only a minority of patients will achieve and maintain BP goals on monotherapy. The recent re-appraisal of the European guidelines also recommended the preferential use of SPCs to improve adherence.

There are a number of compelling reasons why early combination therapy should be used in patients with hypertension (Table 1), including lack of efficacy with monotherapy, greater BP control and attenuation of side effects associated with monotherapeutic treatment. In addition, hypertensive patients with comorbidities, such as renal disease, might benefit from additional effects of multiple antihypertensive agents, beyond those related to BP lowering.

### Management of diabetes and hypertension within the gulf region: updates on treatment practices and therapies [^31ccfe08]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death globally, driven by the high rates of risk factors, such as diabetes and hypertension. As the prevalence of these risk factors is particularly high in the Gulf region, better diagnosis and management of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and hypertension has the potential to dramatically reduce adverse cardiovascular outcomes for individuals in that part of the world. This article provides a summary of presentations made during the EVIDENT summit, a virtual symposium on Evidence in Diabetes and Hypertension, held in September 2021, including a review of the various guidelines for both T2D and hypertension, as well as recent findings relevant to the safety and efficacy for therapies relating to these conditions. Of relevance to the Gulf region, the risk of hypoglycaemia with sulfonylureas during Ramadan was reviewed. For the management of T2D, sulfonylureas have been a long-standing medication used to achieve glycaemic control; however, differences have emerged between early and later generations, with recent studies suggesting improvements in the safety profiles of late-generation sulfonylureas. For patients with hypertension, incremental therapy changes are recommended to reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications that are associated with increasing blood pressure. For first-line therapy, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), such as perindopril, have been demonstrated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. The addition of calcium channel blockers and diuretics to ACEi has been shown to be effective in patients with poorly controlled hypertension. The different renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors are reviewed, and the benefit of combination therapies, including amlodipine and indapamide in patients with difficult-to-control hypertension, is investigated. The benefits of lifestyle modifications for these patients are also discussed, with important clinical considerations that are expected to inform patient management in daily clinical practice.

### Management of diabetes and hypertension within the gulf region: updates on treatment practices and therapies [^6764f1b1]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes is a chronic, progressive disease that is associated with high morbidity and mortality, and a substantial proportion of the diabetic population also have hypertension. Sulfonylureas (SUs) are still one of the most commonly prescribed anti-diabetic therapies, and within the Eastern Mediterranean region, the combination of metformin and SU account for 23.9% of first-line prescriptions. Since their introduction as an anti-diabetic therapy in the 1960s, different generations of SU have been developed, with differences in absorption and metabolism, as well as interactions with SUR1 and SUR2 receptors, noted between agents.

Hypertension is a highly prevalent condition that significantly increases a patient's risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of death from non-communicable causes globally. For the treatment of hypertension, renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASis) are the most widely prescribed class of drugs, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), the two most clinically relevant anti-hypertensive agents. While RAASi are generally prescribed as a first-line therapy, poorly controlled hypertension is often managed with the addition of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and diuretics.

Given the high prevalence of both T2D and hypertension within the Gulf region, optimal management of patients with these conditions is essential to prevent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The current article describes several presentations made during the EVIDENT summit, a virtual symposium on Evidence in Diabetes and Hypertension, held in September 2021. These presentations examine current recommendations and evidence for the management of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and hypertension. Specifically, for patients with uncontrolled hypertension, current guidelines were reviewed and strategies for effective blood pressure (BP) control were investigated, along with efficacy and safety data for different classes of anti-hypertensives. In addition, the value of target glycaemic control in patients with diabetes was explored and safety data for early- and later-generation SU were evaluated. This article is based on previously conducted studies and does not contain any new studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors.

Recommendation 7 — initial drug selection for the general black population — states that "in the general black population, including those with diabetes, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide-type diuretic or CCB", graded as "Moderate Recommendation – Grade B" for the general black population and "Weak Recommendation – Grade C" for black patients with diabetes. The text further states that "both thiazide-type diuretics and CCBs are recommended as first-line therapy for hypertension in black patients", and "the panel recommended a CCB over an ACEI as first-line therapy in black patients because there was a 51% higher rate (relative risk, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.22–1.86) of stroke… with the use of an ACEI as initial therapy compared with use of a CCB"; it also notes "there were no differences in other outcomes" between a CCB and a diuretic and that "There were no outcome studies… that compared diuretics or CCBs vs β-blockers, ARBs, or other renin-angiotensin system inhibitors in black patients".

### First-line diuretics versus other classes of antihypertensive drugs for hypertension [^888a00b7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Different first-line drug classes for patients with hypertension are often assumed to have similar effectiveness with respect to reducing mortality and morbidity outcomes, and lowering blood pressure. First-line low-dose thiazide diuretics have been previously shown to have the best mortality and morbidity evidence when compared with placebo or no treatment. Head-to-head comparisons of thiazides with other blood pressure-lowering drug classes would demonstrate whether there are important differences.

Objectives

To compare the effects of first-line diuretic drugs with other individual first-line classes of antihypertensive drugs on mortality, morbidity, and withdrawals due to adverse effects in patients with hypertension. Secondary objectives included assessments of the need for added drugs, drug switching, and blood pressure-lowering.

Search Methods

Cochrane Hypertension's Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and trials registers to March 2021. We also checked references and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. A top-up search of the Specialized Register was carried out in June 2022.

Selection Criteria

Randomized active comparator trials of at least one year's duration were included. Trials had a clearly defined intervention arm of a first-line diuretic (thiazide, thiazide-like, or loop diuretic) compared to another first-line drug class: beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, alpha adrenergic blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, direct renin inhibitors, or other antihypertensive drug classes. Studies had to include clearly defined mortality and morbidity outcomes (serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), congestive heart failure, and withdrawals due to adverse effects).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures.

Main Results

We included 20 trials with 26 comparator arms randomizing over 90,000 participants. The findings are relevant to first-line use of drug classes in older male and female hypertensive patients (aged 50 to 75) with multiple co-morbidities, including type 2 diabetes. First-line thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics were compared with beta-blockers (six trials), calcium channel blockers (eight trials), ACE inhibitors (five trials), and alpha-adrenergic blockers (three trials); other comparators included angiotensin II receptor blockers, aliskiren (a direct renin inhibitor), and clonidine (a centrally acting drug). Only three studies reported data for total serious adverse events: two studies compared diuretics with calcium channel blockers and one with a direct renin inhibitor. Compared to first-line beta-blockers, first-line thiazides probably result in little to no difference in total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 1.10; 5 trials, 18,241 participants; moderate-certainty), probably reduce total cardiovascular events (5.4% versus 4.8%; RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.00; 4 trials, 18,135 participants; absolute risk reduction (ARR) 0.6%, moderate-certainty), may result in little to no difference in stroke (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.09; 4 trials, 18,135 participants; low-certainty), CHD (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.07; 4 trials, 18,135 participants; low-certainty), or heart failure (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.19; 1 trial, 6569 participants; low-certainty), and probably reduce withdrawals due to adverse effects (10.1% versus 7.9%; RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.85; 5 trials, 18,501 participants; ARR 2.2%; moderate-certainty). Compared to first-line calcium channel blockers, first-line thiazides probably result in little to no difference in total mortality (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.08; 7 trials, 35,417 participants; moderate-certainty), may result in little to no difference in serious adverse events (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.24; 2 trials, 7204 participants; low-certainty), probably reduce total cardiovascular events (14.3% versus 13.3%; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.98; 6 trials, 35,217 participants; ARR 1.0%; moderate-certainty), probably result in little to no difference in stroke (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.18; 6 trials, 35,217 participants; moderate-certainty) or CHD (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.08; 6 trials, 35,217 participants; moderate-certainty), probably reduce heart failure (4.4% versus 3.2%; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.82; 6 trials, 35,217 participants; ARR 1.2%; moderate-certainty), and may reduce withdrawals due to adverse effects (7.6% versus 6.2%; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.88; 7 trials, 33,908 participants; ARR 1.4%; low-certainty). Compared to first-line ACE inhibitors, first-line thiazides probably result in little to no difference in total mortality (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.07; 3 trials, 30,961 participants; moderate-certainty), may result in little to no difference in total cardiovascular events (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.02; 3 trials, 30,900 participants; low-certainty), probably reduce stroke slightly (4.7% versus 4.1%; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.99; 3 trials, 30,900 participants; ARR 0.6%; moderate-certainty), probably result in little to no difference in CHD (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.12; 3 trials, 30,900 participants; moderate-certainty) or heart failure (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.04; 2 trials, 30,392 participants; moderate-certainty), and probably reduce withdrawals due to adverse effects (3.9% versus 2.9%; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.84; 3 trials, 25,254 participants; ARR 1.0%; moderate-certainty). Compared to first-line alpha-blockers, first-line thiazides probably result in little to no difference in total mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.09; 1 trial, 24,316 participants; moderate-certainty), probably reduce total cardiovascular events (12.1% versus 9.0%; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.80; 2 trials, 24,396 participants; ARR 3.1%; moderate-certainty) and stroke (2.7% versus 2.3%; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.01; 2 trials, 24,396 participants; ARR 0.4%; moderate-certainty), may result in little to no difference in CHD (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.11; 2 trials, 24,396 participants; low-certainty), probably reduce heart failure (5.4% versus 2.8%; RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.58; 1 trial, 24,316 participants; ARR 2.6%; moderate-certainty), and may reduce withdrawals due to adverse effects (1.3% versus 0.9%; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.89; 3 trials, 24,772 participants; ARR 0.4%; low-certainty). For the other drug classes, data were insufficient. No antihypertensive drug class demonstrated any clinically important advantages over first-line thiazides.

Authors' Conclusions

When used as first-line agents for the treatment of hypertension, thiazides and thiazide-like drugs likely do not change total mortality and likely decrease some morbidity outcomes such as cardiovascular events and withdrawals due to adverse effects, when compared to beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, and alpha-blockers.

### Controlling hypertension in patients with diabetes [^5bbbee41]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Hypertension and diabetes mellitus are common diseases in the United States. Patients with diabetes have a much higher rate of hypertension than would be expected in the general population. Regardless of the antihypertensive agent used, a reduction in blood pressure helps to prevent diabetic complications. Barring contraindications, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are considered first-line therapy in patients with diabetes and hypertension because of their well-established renal protective effects. Calcium channel blockers, low-dose diuretics, beta blockers, and alpha blockers have also been studied in this group. Most diabetic patients with hypertension require combination therapy to achieve optimal blood pressure goals.

### Clinical overview of hypertension and emerging treatment considerations [^bbf9517c]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Managing hypertension is a complex undertaking, where even the definition of the disorder is subject to discussion. Recently, there has been controversy concerning the most appropriate measure to determine health risks associated with hypertension. In the past, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was the prime measure for defining hypertension, but currently systolic blood pressure (SBP) and pulse pressure have gained favor. Evidence now suggests that all three measures should be considered as part of the hypertensive profile, with the patient's age determining the relative importance of each. Aggressive treatment of hypertension may reduce morbidity and mortality. Data from trials clearly indicate that, for all stages of hypertension, the goal should be a maximum SBP of < 150 mm Hg and a DBP of < 90 mm Hg, with DBP values as low as 70 mm Hg being safe. For individuals with diabetes mellitus, these target values should be even lower — SBP < 140 mm Hg and DBP < 80 mm Hg. As a significant number of deaths attributable to hypertension occur in patients who are not diagnosed as hypertensive but whose blood pressure (BP) is above the optimal level of 120/80 mm Hg, lowering BP levels in this group is recommended as well, with lifestyle modification being first-line therapy. Because controlling BP to < 140/90 mm Hg often requires the use of two or three agents, the tolerability of the entire regimen must be considered. However, with the multitude of antihypertensive drugs currently available, no patient's BP should remain above the 150/90 mm Hg level.

### Narrative review of data supporting alternate first-line therapies over metformin in type 2 diabetes [^030e3b62]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Since then, the ADA guideline of 2023 has modified its pharmacological treatment algorithm based on cardiorenal risk reduction in high-risk patients or achievement and maintenance of glycemic and weight management goals. Thus, the first-line therapy option is highly dependent on patient specific factors. The AACE guideline of 2023 has included therapy options of either a GLP-1 RA or pioglitazone for patients who have experienced strokes or transient ischemic attacks, and continues to recommend mono, dual, or triple therapy based on HbA1c laboratory values. The ESC/EASD has not released an updated guideline for the management of pre-diabetes, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.

GLP-1 RA offer a wide range of benefits in the management of DMII. Clinical trials have demonstrated their efficacy in improving glycemic control by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion and suppressing glucagon release. Additionally, GLP-1 RA can help patients achieve significant weight loss due to their effects on appetite suppression, delayed gastric emptying, and promoting satiety which can be beneficial for patients with obesity. Other studies have demonstrated that GLP-1 RA have large CV benefits such as reduction in major adverse CV events. GLP-1 RA have proven to be a favorable therapeutic option in the management of DMII.

SGLT-2i are also a valuable therapeutic class for treatment of DMII for similar reasons as GLP-1 RA. These agents improve glycemic control by inhibiting renal glucose reabsorption, resulting in increased urinary glucose excretion. SGLT-2i can provide reductions in body weight and blood pressure, which offer advantages for patients with T2DM with obesity or hypertension. SGLT-2i have shown CV benefits as evidenced by reduced rates of cardiovascular deaths and hospitalizations from heart failure in clinical trials. These agents also exhibit renoprotective effects and have been shown to slow the progression of diabetic kidney disease. The multifaceted benefits of SGLT-2i position them as valuable therapeutic options in the comprehensive management of DMII.

By thoroughly examining supportive literature, this review article aims to assess whether metformin should remain a solitary first-line agent or if clinicians may consider GLP-1 RA and SGLT-2i as first line therapy options without metformin on board.

### Cost-effectiveness analyses of antihypertensive medicines: a systematic review [^b97c4929]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adultsrecommends several possible medicine classes for initial treatment of hypertension. TD, CCB, ACEI, or ARB classes are recommended as the initial choice of antihypertensive medicines for non–African-American patients and for patients with diabetes. For African-American patients TDs and CCBs are recommended, and for patients with chronic kidney disease, ACEIs and ARBs are recommended. Prescribers may consider adding another medicine from TD, CCB, ACEI, or ARB classes for the second step, and then β-blockers, aldosterone antagonists, or others for the third step. Similarly, several medicine classes are recommended for first-line therapy in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline for hypertension. The recommended initial treatment option is ACEIs or low-cost ARBs for patients aged < 55 years, CCBs for those aged ≥ 55 years or African American, and TD if CCBs are not suitable; β-blockers are not a preferred initial therapy. The second-line therapy is dual therapy of ACEs or ARBs with a CCB for most patients. The third-line therapy is the use of three medicines, including ACE or ARB with a CCB, and a TD, if required. Because several pharmacologic treatment options can be used for the first-line therapy, it is important to evaluate which medicines are more cost effective among those options.

The evidence from pharmacoeconomic evaluations can provide valuable information for decision makers in setting public health priorities. Many pharmacoeconomic studies of antihypertensive medicines conducted in recent years have found control of hypertension to be cost effective. Several systematic reviews of these studies also have been published, but their focus has been on a specific medicine, such as irbesartan, or medicine class, such as ACEIs or ARBs. Thus, no comprehensive review has been conducted for studies across all anti-hypertensive medicine classes. The objectives are to systematically review all pharmacoeconomic evaluations of antihypertensive medicines and summarize the cost effectiveness of these medicines.

### Hypertension management in type 2 diabetes mellitus: recommendations of the Joint National Committee VII [^0c9076cb]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

HTN in patients who have diabetes should be managed aggressively; the goal BP of less than 130/80 mm Hg should be attained if clinicians seek to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality for these patients. Along with instituting medical therapy after HTN is detected, lifestyle modifications need to be managed aggressively, together with strict glycemic and lipid control. Early management and optimization of treatment of HTN can delay and possibly prevent progression of cardiovascular complications, such as CAD, CKD, peripheral vascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease. Studied approaches to treat HTN in diabetics have included ACEIs and ARBs. Either class of medication, generally in combination with a thiazide diuretic, should be considered as initial therapy. Calcium antagonists, BBs, and alpha-antagonists also have a role in this population of patients, usually as third- and fourth-line add-ons. The importance of using agents that block RAAS is becoming understood better. Typically, three or more antihypertensive medications plus lifestyle interventions are required to achieve a goal BP of less than 130/80 mm Hg. Managing patients who have diabetes and HTN is a dynamic, ever-changing challenge. Early and aggressive antihypertensive therapy pays off; it is hoped that the insights in this article enable clinicians to meet the challenge more successfully.

American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) 2023 type 2 diabetes algorithm — core themes emphasize lifestyle modification and treatment of overweight/obesity as key pillars in prediabetes and diabetes mellitus (DM) care, along with appropriate management of dyslipidemia and hypertension risk factors. A notable new theme is an emphasis on a complication-centric approach, beyond glucose levels, to frame decisions regarding lifestyle/pharmacologic choices, including decisions regarding first-line pharmacologic choices for persons with DM. The algorithm also incorporates access/cost of medications as health equity factors in clinical decision-making, and acknowledges that health care disparities and lack of access to newer medications remain a significant barrier for some persons with DM.

### Blood pressure control in type 2 diabetic patients [^ad81ce5e]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2017). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) and essential hypertension are common conditions that are frequently present together. Both are considered risk factors for cardiovascular disease and microvascular complications and therefore treatment of both conditions is essential. Many papers were published on blood pressure (BP) targets in diabetic patients, including several works published in the last 2 years. As a result, guidelines differ in their recommendations on BP targets in diabetic patients. The method by which to control hypertension, whether pharmacological or non-pharmacological, is also a matter of debate and has been extensively studied in the literature. In recent years, new medications were introduced for the treatment of DM, some of which also affect BP and the clinician treating hypertensive and diabetic patients should be familiar with these medications and their effect on BP. In this manuscript, we discuss the evidence supporting different BP targets in diabetics and review the various guidelines on this topic. In addition, we discuss the various options available for the treatment of hypertension in diabetics and the recommendations for a specific treatment over the other. Finally we briefly discuss the new diabetic drug classes and their influence on BP.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^f257ace0]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Top 10 take-home messages for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease — The most important way to prevent atherosclerotic vascular disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation is to promote a healthy lifestyle throughout life. A team-based care approach is an effective strategy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease, and clinicians should evaluate the social determinants of health that affect individuals to inform treatment decisions. Adults who are 40 to 75 years of age and are being evaluated for cardiovascular disease prevention should undergo 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk estimation and have a clinician–patient risk discussion before starting on pharmacological therapy, such as antihypertensive therapy, a statin, or aspirin; the presence or absence of additional risk-enhancing factors and coronary artery calcium scanning can help guide decisions. All adults should consume a healthy diet that emphasizes the intake of vegetables, fruits, nuts, whole grains, lean vegetable or animal protein, and fish and minimizes the intake of trans fats, red meat and processed red meats, refined carbohydrates, and sweetened beverages; for adults with overweight and obesity, counseling and caloric restriction are recommended for achieving and maintaining weight loss. Adults should engage in at least 150 minutes per week of accumulated moderate-intensity physical activity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity physical activity. For adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, if medication is indicated, metformin is first-line therapy, followed by consideration of a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor or a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist. All adults should be assessed at every healthcare visit for tobacco use, and those who use tobacco should be assisted and strongly advised to quit. Aspirin should be used infrequently in the routine primary prevention of ASCVD because of lack of net benefit. Statin therapy is first-line treatment for primary prevention of ASCVD in patients with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (≥ 190 mg/dL), those with diabetes mellitus, who are 40 to 75 years of age, and those determined to be at sufficient ASCVD risk after a clinician–patient risk discussion. Nonpharmacological interventions are recommended for all adults with elevated blood pressure or hypertension, and for those requiring pharmacological therapy, the target blood pressure should generally be < 130/80 mm Hg.

Hypertension/Blood Pressure Control

Screening and diagnosis

Blood pressure should be measured at every routine diabetes visit. Patients found to have systolic blood pressure ≥ 130 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 80 mmHg should have blood pressure confirmed on a separate day. Repeat systolic blood pressure ≥ 130 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 80 mmHg confirms a diagnosis of hypertension. (C)

Goals

Patients with diabetes should be treated to a systolic blood pressure < 130 mmHg. (C)
Patients with diabetes should be treated to a diastolic blood pressure < 80 mmHg. (B)

Treatment

Patients with a systolic blood pressure of 130–139 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure of 80–89 mmHg may be given lifestyle therapy alone for a maximum of 3 months and then, if targets are not achieved, treated with addition of pharmacological agents. (E)
Patients with more severe hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg) at diagnosis or follow-up should receive pharmacologic therapy in addition to lifestyle therapy. (A)
Pharmacologic therapy for patients with diabetes and hypertension should be with a regimen that includes either an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). If one class is not tolerated, the other should be substituted. If needed to achieve blood pressure targets, a thiazide diuretic should be added to those with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (see below) ≥ 30 ml/min per 1.73 m² and a loop diuretic for those with an estimated GFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m². (C)
Multiple drug therapy (two or more agents at maximal doses) is generally required to achieve blood pressure targets. (B)
If ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or diuretics are used, kidney function and serum potassium levels should be closely monitored. (E)
In pregnant patients with diabetes and chronic hypertension, blood pressure target goals of 110–129/65–79 mmHg are suggested in the interest of long-term maternal health and minimizing impaired fetal growth. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are contraindicated during pregnancy. (E)

### Pharmacologic management of hypertension in patients with diabetes [^b566fce3]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a common comorbidity in patients with diabetes, and adequate control of blood pressure significantly reduces the risk of macrovascular and microvascular complications. Patients with diabetes should achieve a target blood pressure of less than 130/80 mm Hg. The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may slow progression to kidney failure and cardiovascular mortality; these agents are the preferred therapy for managing coexisting diabetes and hypertension. Angiotensin receptor blockers can prevent progression of diabetic kidney disease and are a first-line alternative for patients intolerant of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Thiazide diuretics provide additional antihypertensive effects when combined with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. With lower doses of these drugs, the risk of clinically significant metabolic alterations is minimal. Beta blockers and calcium channel blockers also have beneficial effects in managing hypertension in patients with diabetes. Beta blockers reduce cardiovascular events and are useful in a multidrug regimen. Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers should be reserved for patients intolerant of preferred agents or those who need additional therapy to achieve target blood pressure. Many patients with diabetes require combination therapy with multiple antihypertensive agents.

### Dietary approach for the treatment of arterial hypertension in patients with diabetes mellitus [^1ce2c0cd]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

The association of hypertension and diabetes mellitus is extremely common, increasing the mortality risk of patients, mainly by cardiovascular causes. Regarding the blood pressure (BP) targets to be achieved, most guidelines suggest levels of 130mmHg for SBP and of 80mmHg for DBP. Dietary modifications are quite effective, and many studies suggest that decreasing sodium intake and increasing potassium ingestion are both valuable practices for reducing BP. This can be achieved by stimulating the ingestion of lacteous products, vegetables, and nuts. As for the ideal pharmacologic treatment for hypertension, either calcium channel blockers, diuretics or angiotensin-system blockers can be the first class of drug to be used. In this review, we summarize the evaluation of patients with diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and discuss the available therapeutic approaches, with emphasis on evidence-based dietary recommendations.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: comprehensive type 2 diabetes management algorithm-2023 update [^e2a2e926]. Endocrine Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

This consensus statement provides (1) visual guidance in concise graphic algorithms to assist with clinical decision-making of health care professionals in the management of persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve patient care and (2) a summary of details to support the visual guidance found in each algorithm.

Methods

The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) selected a task force of medical experts who updated the 2020 AACE Comprehensive Type 2 Diabetes Management Algorithm based on the 2022 AACE Clinical Practice Guideline: Developing a Diabetes Mellitus Comprehensive Care Plan and consensus of task force authors.

Results

This algorithm for management of persons with type 2 diabetes includes 11 distinct sections: (1) Principles for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes; (2) Complications-Centric Model for the Care of Persons with Overweight/Obesity; (3) Prediabetes Algorithm; (4) Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction Algorithm: Dyslipidemia; (5) Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction Algorithm: Hypertension; (6) Complications-Centric Algorithm for Glycemic Control; (7) Glucose-Centric Algorithm for Glycemic Control; (8) Algorithm for Adding/Intensifying Insulin; (9) Profiles of Antihyperglycemic Medications; (10) Profiles of Weight-Loss Medications (new); and (11) Vaccine Recommendations for Persons with Diabetes Mellitus (new), which summarizes recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Conclusions

Aligning with the 2022 AACE diabetes guideline update, this 2023 diabetes algorithm update emphasizes lifestyle modification and treatment of overweight/obesity as key pillars in the management of prediabetes and diabetes mellitus and highlights the importance of appropriate management of atherosclerotic risk factors of dyslipidemia and hypertension. One notable new theme is an emphasis on a complication-centric approach, beyond glucose levels, to frame decisions regarding first-line pharmacologic choices for the treatment of persons with diabetes. The algorithm also includes access/cost of medications as factors related to health equity to consider in clinical decision-making.

### Hypertension pharmacological treatment in adults: a World Health Organization guideline executive summary [^e3025d91]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

In 1978, the World Health Organization (WHO) published one of the earliest clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of arterial hypertension, which were later updated in 1999 and 2003. In 2007, the WHO published some recommendations for the management of hypertension in guidelines for the assessment and management of total CVD risk. However, these are now outdated considering new evidence and practices. Guidance is particularly needed now on some controversial issues, such as the threshold level of BP at which to start pharmacological treatment and whether laboratory testing and CVD risk assessment are needed before initiating antihypertensive pharmacological therapy. In the past decade, the WHO included diagnosis and management of hypertension in a total CVD risk approach as part of the WHO Package of Essential Noncommunicable Disease Interventions (WHO PEN) 2007, 2010, and 2013. However, this approach preceded recent advances in the pharmacological management of hypertension. More recently, the WHO has provided information about the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the Global HEARTS Initiative including the HEARTS Technical Package and the HEARTS in the Americas Program. However, these too provide general practical information and not specific guidelines and recommendations. The WHO Essential Medicines List includes ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, and thiazide diuretics for management of hypertension. In June 2019, single-pill combination antihypertensive medications were added to the WHO Essential Medicines List.

Herein, we summarize the recommendations of the 2021 WHO Guidelines for the Pharmacological Treatment of Hypertension in Adults. They include guidance on the BP threshold for the initiation of pharmacological treatment for hypertension, initial and longer-term visit intervals for follow-up of treated patients, treatment target BP levels, and the best use of health care workers for management of hypertension. The 2021 WHO hypertension guidelines aim to provide the most current and relevant evidence-based guidance for pharmacological treatment of hypertension in nonpregnant adults, with a particular focus on practice in middle- and low-income countries.

Although these guidelines do not address modifiable risk factors for hypertension such as unhealthy diet, overweight, obesity, physical inactivity, or consumption of alcohol, a comprehensive treatment plan for hypertension should address these risk factors through lifestyle modifications and other interventions. Likewise, treatment of hypertension should be accompanied by management of other CVD risk factors such as cigarette smoking, diabetes, lipid abnormalities, and comorbid conditions.

### Cardiovascular disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^3a15de04]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Recommendations for the treatment of confirmed hypertension in nonpregnant people with diabetes — initial blood pressure (BP) determines the number of agents and stepwise escalation. Initial BP ≥ 130/80 and < 150/90 mmHg — start one agent, whereas initial BP ≥ 150/90 mmHg — start two agents. One‑agent options include start ACEi or ARB or CCB† or diuretic‡; for two‑drug initiation, options include start two drugs from ACEi or ARB, CCB† or diuretic‡ or start ACEi or ARB and CCB† or diuretic‡. Assess BP management and adverse effects; if not meeting goal, add agent from complementary drug class (ACEi or ARB; CCB†; Diuretic‡), and for adverse effects, consider change to alternative medication (ACEi or ARB; CCB†; Diuretic‡). If not meeting goal on two agents and then not meeting goal or adverse effects using a drug from each of three classes, consider addition of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist and refer to specialist with expertise in BP management; an ACE inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) is suggested for coronary artery disease (CAD) or urine albumin‑to‑creatinine ratio 30–299 mg/g creatinine and is strongly recommended for urine albumin‑to‑creatinine ratio ≥ 300 mg/g creatinine.

### Should metformin continue as first-line pharmacotherapy… [^0dd2a8a8]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

Yes: Metformin Is Still the Best Choice Metformin has been the first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus for decades. The glucose-lowering effects of metformin were first discovered in the 1920s. 1 After extensive use throughout Europe, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration approved metformin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes with a 1995 randomized controlled trial demonstrating metformin's safety and efficacy. 2 Following two decades of widespread use in the United States, extended-release and combination formulations were introduced. 4 This study shifted primarily sulfonylurea-based regimens to metformin-first regimens for the treatment of non–insulin-dependent diabetes. Subsequent studies demonstrating reduced mortality in populations with atherothrombosis or heart failure and its affordable cost further solidified metformin as the preferred initial treatment for diabetes.

5, 6 Metformin is the most commonly prescribed glucose-lowering medication worldwide and the recommended initial pharmacologic option in major clinical guidelines, including those from the International Diabetes Federation, American Association of Clinical Endocrinology, and American College of Physicians. 7–9. During the years the FDA guidance was in effect, two novel classes of medications were developed, studied, and marketed: sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists. Both have been shown to reduce ASCVD events in patients with type 2 diabetes, leading to questions about whether they should be considered first-line therapy. 17 However, selecting therapy to meet patient goals is the approach every clinician should use for those with type 2 diabetes; this does not automatically exclude the use of metformin.

The goals for each patient are different and include considerations such as costs, adverse effects, and administration. Metformin's established safety and effectiveness at A1C reduction — in addition to its relatively low cost and widespread availability to patients — make it an ideal first-line option for many patients with diabetes. Because of safety concerns, metformin is preferred over other older and inexpensive options such as sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones.
9. Metformin should be included in first-line medication regimens. Whether additional therapies are started concurrently or deferred depends on individual patient goals. Primary care physicians should not overstate the ASCVD benefits of SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonist medications.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^a4680c5c]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Hypertension is the most common condition seen in primary care and leads to myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, and death if not detected early and treated appropriately. Patients want to be assured that blood pressure (BP) treatment will reduce their disease burden, while clinicians want guidance on hypertension management using the best scientific evidence. This report takes a rigorous, evidence-based approach to recommend treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults. Evidence was drawn from randomized controlled trials, which represent the gold standard for determining efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence quality and recommendations were graded based on their effect on important outcomes. There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg; however, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg for those groups based on expert opinion. The same thresholds and goals are recommended for hypertensive adults with diabetes or nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) as for the general hypertensive population younger than 60 years. There is moderate evidence to support initiating drug treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, or thiazide-type diuretic in the nonblack hypertensive population, including those with diabetes. In the black hypertensive population, including those with diabetes, a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-type diuretic is recommended as initial therapy. There is moderate evidence to support initial or add-on antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in persons with CKD to improve kidney outcomes. Although this guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the management of high BP and should meet the clinical needs of most patients, these recommendations are not a substitute for clinical judgment, and decisions about care must carefully consider and incorporate the clinical characteristics and circumstances of each individual patient.

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^9b609f23]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

JNC 8 Recommendations 6 to 9

In the general nonblack population, including those with diabetes, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide‐type diuretic, CCB, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), or ARB. In the general black population, including those with diabetes, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide‐type diuretic or CCB. In the population aged ≥ 18 years with CKD, initial (or add‐on) antihypertensive treatment should include an ACEI or ARB to improve kidney outcomes. If goal BP is not reached within 1 month of treatment, increase the dose of the initial drug or add a second drug, and if goal BP cannot be reached with 2 drugs, add and titrate a third drug. Referral to a hypertension specialist is recommended for patients in whom goal BP cannot be attained.

Basis of Recommendations

In contrast to treatment targets, most professional societies agree on the class of antihypertensives to use for specific comorbid disease categories (Table 1). For the nonblack population without diabetes, all society recommendations include thiazide diuretics, CCBs, ACEIs, and ARBs as first‐line therapies. An important consideration with thiazide diuretics is that the strength of individual drugs within the class varies in BP‐lowering effects.

A Cochrane Review of > 60 RCTs for thiazide monotherapy versus placebo in adults with primary hypertension (BP 140 to < 160/90 to < 100 mm Hg) examined the BP effects of 6 different thiazide diuretics. 46 Hydrochlorothiazide, unlike the other thiazide medications studied, demonstrated a dose‐dependent BP reduction. Compared with placebo, the effect of hydrochlorothiazide on BP ranged from 6.25 mg/d, leading to a 4–mm Hg (95% CI 2 to 6)/2–mm Hg (95% CI 1 to 4) reduction, to 50 mg/d, resulting in a 11–mm Hg (95% CI 6 to 15)/5–mm Hg (95% CI 3 to 7) reduction. Chlorthalidone, regardless of dose ranging from 12.5 mg to 75 mg/d, led to a 12–mm Hg (95% CI 10 to 14)/4–mm Hg (95% CI 3 to 5) reduction in BP. While the maximal effects were judged to be similar between the different thiazides, attention to dosing is important given the wide range of effect with hydrochlorothiazide.

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^a633a2d5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This is the first update of a review published in 2009. Sustained moderate to severe elevations in resting blood pressure leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug to use first-line? This review attempted to answer that question.

Objectives

To quantify the mortality and morbidity effects from different first-line antihypertensive drug classes: thiazides (low-dose and high-dose), beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), and alpha-blockers, compared to placebo or no treatment. Secondary objectives: when different antihypertensive drug classes are used as the first-line drug, to quantify the blood pressure lowering effect and the rate of withdrawal due to adverse drug effects, compared to placebo or no treatment.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials (RCT) of at least one year duration, comparing one of six major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment, in adult patients with blood pressure over 140/90 mmHg at baseline. The majority (over 70%) of the patients in the treatment group were taking the drug class of interest after one year. We included trials with both hypertensive and normotensive patients in this review if the majority (over 70%) of patients had elevated blood pressure, or the trial separately reported outcome data on patients with elevated blood pressure.

Data Collection and Analysis

The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), total cardiovascular events (CVS), decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. We used a fixed-effect model to to combine dichotomous outcomes across trials and calculate risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We presented blood pressure data as mean difference (MD) with 99% CI.

Main Results

The 2017 updated search failed to identify any new trials. The original review identified 24 trials with 28 active treatment arms, including 58,040 patients. We found no RCTs for ARBs or alpha-blockers. These results are mostly applicable to adult patients with moderate to severe primary hypertension. The mean age of participants was 56 years, and mean duration of follow-up was three to five years. High-quality evidence showed that first-line low-dose thiazides reduced mortality (11.0% with control versus 9.8% with treatment; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.97); total CVS (12.9% with control versus 9.0% with treatment; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.76), stroke (6.2% with control versus 4.2% with treatment; RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.77), and coronary heart disease (3.9% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.84). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line high-dose thiazides reduced stroke (1.9% with control versus 0.9% with treatment; RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.61) and total CVS (5.1% with control versus 3.7% with treatment; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.82), but did not reduce mortality (3.1% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.05), or coronary heart disease (2.7% with control versus 2.7% with treatment; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.20). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line beta-blockers did not reduce mortality (6.2% with control versus 6.0% with treatment; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.07) or coronary heart disease (4.4% with control versus 3.9% with treatment; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.03), but reduced stroke (3.4% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97) and total CVS (7.6% with control versus 6.8% with treatment; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.98). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line ACE inhibitors reduced mortality (13.6% with control versus 11.3% with treatment; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95), stroke (6.0% with control versus 3.9% with treatment; RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.82), coronary heart disease (13.5% with control versus 11.0% with treatment; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.94), and total CVS (20.1% with control versus 15.3% with treatment; RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.85). Low-quality evidence showed that first-line calcium channel blockers reduced stroke (3.4% with control versus 1.9% with treatment; RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.84) and total CVS (8.0% with control versus 5.7% with treatment; RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.87), but not coronary heart disease (3.1% with control versus 2.4% with treatment; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.09), or mortality (6.0% with control versus 5.1% with treatment; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.09). There was low-quality evidence that withdrawals due to adverse effects were increased with first-line low-dose thiazides (5.0% with control versus 11.3% with treatment; RR 2.38, 95% CI 2.06 to 2.75), high-dose thiazides (2.2% with control versus 9.8% with treatment; RR 4.48, 95% CI 3.83 to 5.24), and beta-blockers (3.1% with control versus 14.4% with treatment; RR 4.59, 95% CI 4.11 to 5.13). No data for these outcomes were available for first-line ACE inhibitors or calcium channel blockers. The blood pressure data were not used to assess the effect of the different classes of drugs as the data were heterogeneous, and the number of drugs used in the trials differed.

Authors' Conclusions

First-line low-dose thiazides reduced all morbidity and mortality outcomes in adult patients with moderate to severe primary hypertension. First-line ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers may be similarly effective, but the evidence was of lower quality. First-line high-dose thiazides and first-line beta-blockers were inferior to first-line low-dose thiazides.

### Should metformin remain the first-line therapy for treatment of type 2 diabetes? [^c75549e5]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

American Diabetes Association (ADA) standards of care guidelines

In 2008, the first ADA and European Association of the Study of Diabetes (EASD) consensus guidelines on management of hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes stated that metformin, along with lifestyle interventions, should be used as first-line therapy. While the guidelines of pharmacologic treatment for type 2 diabetes in the United States have largely remained the same, recent updates in 2019 and 2020 have added additional components in light of compelling data from cardiovascular and renal outcomes trials. According to the ADA 2020 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes, metformin remains the preferred first-line pharmacologic treatment for type 2 diabetes unless contraindicated or not tolerated by the patient. Other glucose-lowering agents may be added to metformin considering patient preferences, hypoglycemic risk, and comorbidities.

While the ADA still recommends metformin as first-line therapy, the updated Standards of Care have become more outcomes-focused rather than solely concentrating on glycemic control. For this reason, in patients with certain comorbidities such as high-risk for or established ASCVD, heart failure or chronic kidney disease, it is recommended to consider GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors independently of baseline HbA1c or individualized HbA1c target. In 2019, the European Society of Cardiology, in collaboration with the EASD, went one step further in altering their treatment guidelines. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs are now recommended as first-line therapy for patients with established ASCVD or high cardiovascular risk in Europe. Metformin should be considered as the first line in patients without CVD and at moderate cardiovascular risk.

### The use of single-pill combinations as first-line treatment for hypertension: translating guidelines into clinical practice [^b1623a3f]. Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

The 2008 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guidelines recommend the first-line prescription of two antihypertensive drugs in single-pill combinations (SPCs), also known as fixed-dose combinations, for the treatment of most patients with hypertension. This recommendation is based on a large amount of data, which shows that first-line treatment with SPCs supports reaching blood pressure targets rapidly and reducing cardiovascular outcome risk while keeping the therapeutic strategies as simple as possible and fostering adherence and persistence. As this approach constitutes a big shift from the stepped-care approaches that have been dominant for many years, practicing physicians have expressed concerns about using SPCs as first-line agents. In this review, we will discuss the barriers to the uptake of this recommendation. We will also offer suggestions to reduce the impact of these barriers and address specific concerns that have been raised.

Recommendations

Screening and diagnosis

Blood pressure should be measured at every routine diabetes visit. Patients found to have a systolic blood pressure of ≥ 130 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure of ≥ 80 mmHg should have blood pressure confirmed on a separate day. Repeat systolic blood pressure of ≥ 130 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of ≥ 80 mmHg confirms a diagnosis of hypertension. (C)

Goals

Patients with diabetes should be treated to a systolic blood pressure < 130 mmHg. (C)
Patients with diabetes should be treated to a diastolic blood pressure < 80 mmHg. (B)

Treatment

Patients with a systolic blood pressure of 130–139 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure of 80–89 mmHg may be given lifestyle therapy alone for a maximum of 3 months and then, if targets are not achieved, be treated with the addition of pharmacological agents. (E)
Patients with more severe hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg) at diagnosis or follow-up should receive pharmacologic therapy in addition to lifestyle therapy. (A)
Pharmacologic therapy for patients with diabetes and hypertension should be with a regimen that includes either an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). If one class is not tolerated, the other should be substituted. If needed to achieve blood pressure targets, a thiazide diuretic should be added to those with an estimated GFR (see below) ≥ 30 ml/min per 1.73 m² and a loop diuretic for those with an estimated GFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m². (C)
Multiple drug therapy (two or more agents at maximal doses) is generally required to achieve blood pressure targets. (B)
If ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or diuretics are used, kidney function and serum potassium levels should be closely monitored. (E)
In pregnant patients with diabetes and chronic hypertension, blood pressure target goals of 110–129/65–79 mmHg are suggested in the interest of long-term maternal health and minimizing impaired fetal growth. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are contraindicated during pregnancy. (E)

Hypertension is a common comorbidity of diabetes, affecting the majority of patients, with prevalence depending on type of diabetes, age, obesity, and ethnicity. Hypertension is a major risk factor for both CVD and microvascular complications. In type 1 diabetes, hypertension is often the result of underlying nephropathy, while in type 2 it usually coexists with other cardiometabolic risk factors.

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^ed44f735]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Sustained elevated blood pressure, unresponsive to lifestyle measures, leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug to use first-line? This review answers that question.

Primary Objective

To quantify the benefits and harms of the major first-line anti-hypertensive drug classes: thiazides, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, alpha-blockers, and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB).

Search Strategy

Electronic search of MEDLINE (Jan. 1966-June 2008), EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane clinical trial register, using standard search strategy of the hypertension review group with additional terms.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials of at least one year duration comparing one of 6 major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment. More than 70% of people must have BP > 140/90 mmHg at baseline.

Data Collection and Analysis

The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), cardiovascular events (CVS), decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. Risk ratio (RR) and a fixed effects model were used to combine outcomes across trials.

Main Results

Of 57 trials identified, 24 trials with 28 arms, including 58,040 patients met the inclusion criteria. Thiazides (19 RCTs) reduced mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83, 0.96), stroke (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.57, 0.71), CHD (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75, 0.95) and CVS (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.66, 0.76). Low-dose thiazides (8 RCTs) reduced CHD (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61, 0.84), but high-dose thiazides (11 RCTs) did not (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85, 1.20). Beta-blockers (5 RCTs) reduced stroke (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72, 0.97) and CVS (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81, 0.98) but not CHD (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78, 1.03) or mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86, 1.07). ACE inhibitors (3 RCTs) reduced mortality (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72–0.95), stroke (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52–0.82), CHD (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70–0.94) and CVS (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67–0.85). Calcium-channel blocker (1 RCT) reduced stroke (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41, 0.84) and CVS (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57, 0.87) but not CHD (RR 0.77 95% CI 0.55, 1.09) or mortality (RR 0.86 95% CI 0.68, 1.09). No RCTs were found for ARBs or alpha-blockers.

Authors' Conclusions

First-line low-dose thiazides reduce all morbidity and mortality outcomes. First-line ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers may be similarly effective but the evidence is less robust. First-line high-dose thiazides and first-line beta-blockers are inferior to first-line low-dose thiazides.

### Single pill combination therapy for hypertension: new evidence and new challenges: combination therapy for hypertension [^cc34b148]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertension (HTN) continues to be one of the most important risk factors for major cardiovascular events and mortality. The global prevalence of hypertension is approximately 30% among adults over 20 years old. Cardiovascular risk stratification is crucial to determine the most appropriate pharmacological therapeutic strategy for hypertensive patients. Despite the many scales to stratify risk, none is perfect and represents weighted mathematical models to determine risk at 10 years. Reports have identified numerous limitations, and the challenge persists. A practical way to determine CV risk is the clinical approach based on 1) the number of risk factors, 2) the degree of elevation of blood pressure, 3) the presence of target organ damage/DM/CKD, and 4) a history of major cardiovascular events. Currently, it is recommended to start with dual therapy in a single pill (either ACE inhibitors or ARB2 + dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers or thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic); however, many patients could need to start with triple therapy (low or standard doses) if they belong to the high- or very high-risk group with elevation grade 2 or 3 of blood pressure. This article discusses this topic and establishes some practical recommendations for the physician of first contact.

Table 6 — 2014 hypertension guideline initial therapy and BP goals for adults with hypertension lists population-specific targets and initial drug treatment options as follows: General ≥ 60 y — goal BP, mm Hg < 150/90 with initial options for Nonblack: thiazide-type diuretic, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), or calcium channel blocker (CCB). General < 60 y — goal BP, mm Hg < 140/90 with initial options for Black: thiazide-type diuretic or CCB. Diabetes — goal BP < 140/90 with initial options thiazide-type diuretic, ACEI, ARB, or CCB. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) — goal BP < 140/90 with initial options ACEI or ARB.

### Pharmacological management of obesity: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^83f9eb95]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity — antihyperglycemic therapy and related agents include that in patients with T2DM who are overweight or obese, we suggest the use of antidiabetic medications that have additional actions to promote weight loss such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs or sodium-glucose–linked transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors in addition to metformin; we recommend weight-losing and weight-neutral medications as first- and second-line agents and clinicians should discuss weight effects and consider weight-neutral or weight-losing antihyperglycemic medications; in obese patients with T2DM requiring insulin therapy, we suggest adding at least one of metformin, pramlintide, or GLP-1 agonists to mitigate insulin-associated weight gain, the first-line insulin for this type of patient should be basal insulin and this is preferable to insulin alone or insulin with sulfonylurea with a preferential trial of basal insulin prior to premixed or combination insulin; and for hypertension in obese patients with T2DM, we recommend ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and calcium channel blockers rather than β-adrenergic blockers as first-line therapy.

### A comparison of the 2017 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association blood pressure guideline and the 2017 American diabetes association diabetes and hypertension position statement for U.S. adults with diabetes [^cb3d61b4]. Diabetes Care (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the concordance in the prevalence of hypertension and pharmacological antihypertensive treatment recommendations for U.S. adults with diabetes using definitions from the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) blood pressure (BP) guideline and the 2017 American Diabetes Association (ADA) diabetes and hypertension position statement.

Research Design and Methods

We analyzed data for U.S. adults with diabetes in the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 2011–2016 (n = 2,266). Diabetes was defined by treatment with glucose-lowering medication, glycosylated hemoglobin ≥ 6.5%, fasting serum glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL, or nonfasting serum glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL. BP was measured three times and antihypertensive medication use was self-reported.

Results

The prevalence (95% CI) of hypertension among U.S. adults with diabetes was 77.1% (73.9, 80.0) and 66.3% (63.4, 69.1) according to the ACC/AHA and ADA definitions, respectively. Also, 22.9% (20.0, 26.1) did not have hypertension according to either definition, and the concordance in hypertension status was 89.2% (87.2, 91.0). Among U.S. adults with diabetes not taking antihypertensive medication, 52.8% (47.7, 57.8) were not recommended to initiate antihypertensive medication by either the ACC/AHA or the ADA document and 22.4% (19.2, 25.9) were recommended to initiate it by both documents (overall concordance 75.2% [70.4, 79.4]). Among those taking antihypertensive medication, 45.3% (41.3, 49.4) and 50.4% (46.5, 54.2) had BP above the goal in neither and both documents, respectively (overall concordance 95.7% [93.4, 97.2]).

Conclusions

A high percentage of U.S. adults with diabetes are provided identical antihypertensive treatment recommendations by the ACC/AHA BP guideline and the ADA diabetes and hypertension position statement.

### Introduction to the second world congress on controversies to consensus in diabetes, obesity and hypertension (CODHy): dilemmas in clinical practice [^5807a92f]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Several lectures and debates dealt with novel therapies of diabetes — including incretin-based therapy, bile acid metabolic regulation, and an innovative therapy for latent autoimmune diabetes in adults — as well as with potential use of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory treatments in diabetes. Speakers discussed the best ways of incorporating novel therapies into the treatment regimen and debated whether the new approaches had created a need for a new paradigm in the treatment of diabetes. Furthermore, a significant part of this supplement is devoted to insulin therapy for type 2 diabetes: the ideal timing for starting such therapy and ways of administering it in the early and late stages of the disease.

This supplement's second section on hypertension covers the management of hypertension in patients with diabetes. What is the definition of prehypertension in diabetes? Should this borderline condition be treated in diabetic patients? How should the treatment approach differ between diabetic and nondiabetic patients? The need for 24-h monitoring of blood pressure in diabetes is also discussed. Yet another topic in this section relates to the risks of white coat hypertension and the pros and cons of treating it in diabetic patients.

The connection between diabetes and cardiovascular disease forms the content of the third section. Because diabetes disrupts endothelial function and otherwise contributes to the appearance of cardiovascular disease, the control of blood glucose levels can play an important role in preventing cardiovascular disease. However, other cardiovascular risk factors are easier to treat than hyperglycemia, and they can be improved with less deleterious side effects. In light of this, what are the relative advantages and disadvantages of hyperglycemia treatment for the prevention of cardiovascular disease? This section provides conclusions drawn from large studies aimed at achieving normoglycemia and discusses the advantages or disadvantages of various hyperglycemic drugs in the prevention of cardiovascular events.

The fourth section, on obesity and lipids, deals with weight gain as a health risk factor for people of all ages, as well as with the need to control various components of dyslipidemia other than LDL (particularly HDL and triglycerides) in the management of obese diabetic patients. The section includes a detailed discussion on the recommendations of the American Diabetes Association for the use of statins in patients with diabetes; evidence from clinical trials suggests that these guidelines might have to be broadened to encompass a wider segment of the population. In addition, the section discusses the role of weight control in the treatment of diabetes. Is weight reduction beneficial in the elderly diabetic patient? Should clinicians concentrate on weight control or physical activity in averting the risk of cardiovascular disease? Highlights of the debates on these topics are provided.

### Epidemiology of hypertension among Bangladeshi adults using the 2017 ACC / AHA hypertension clinical practice guidelines and Joint National Committee 7 guidelines [^5caebdfc]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Published in 2013, the National Guidelines for Management of Hypertension in Bangladesh were developed to provide country-specific guidelines for effective management of hypertension by primary care providers in a low-resource context. The current Bangladeshi guidelines are written based on the JNC 7 guideline's diagnostic criteria of hypertension. Bangladesh's hypertension guidelines highly recommend the use of lifestyle modification or non-pharmacological management at all stages of hypertension as first-line treatment options due to the low resources available in the country. In fact, the algorithm for management of hypertension outlined in Bangladesh's guidelines recommends initiating pharmacologic treatment when BP reads SBP 140–159 mmHg and/or DBP 90–99 mmHg only in the company of major risk factors, such as target organ involvement or diabetes. Pharmacologic intervention is immediately recommended for those to have SBP ≥ 160 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 100, with 3–6-month follow-up and assessment. Based on the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines, these cut-off points for pharmacologic treatment should be revisited. Although the guidelines may not be uniformly accepted by physicians in the United States, revision of Bangladeshi guidelines for hypertension management may lead to improved efforts towards prevention of subsequent CVDs. Recommendations should be adapted from the 2017 ACC/AHA as suitable for a low-resource setting context. The BP cut-off points for pharmacologic treatment initiation should also be re-evaluated to improve treatment recommendations for those at risk for developing CVDs.

### Current management of chronic kidney disease in type-2 diabetes – A tiered approach: an overview of the joint association of British clinical diabetologists and UK kidney association (ABCD-UKKA) guidelines [^cf89557f]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1.3 Hypertension management

The guideline emphasises the importance of accurate BP measurement for the diagnosis of hypertension and monitoring of BP after starting treatment and suggests using standardised BP measurement technique as per the British and Irish Hypertension Society (BIHS) guidance. The mean difference in systolic BP between standardised and routine measurements is around 13 mmHg with wide limits of agreement (−46.1 to 20.7 mm Hg). The suggested threshold for starting pharmacological treatment varies depending on the type of diabetes, the age of the person, presence or absence of CKD and albuminuria.

BP control is the most important measure to slow progression of CKD in people with diabetes. For those with urine albumin creatinine ratio (ACR) 3‐30 mg/mmol, CKD stages 1–3 or stages 4–5 with ACR > 30 mg/mmol, the guidelines recommend a target BP of ≤ 130/80 mmHg. For those with CKD stages 4–5 without albuminuria or who are on dialysis, the recommended target is ≤ 140/90 mmHg.

Angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are the suggested first‐line anti‐hypertensive agents for CKD. If ACE inhibitors are not tolerated, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) should be prescribed. If BP is not controlled to target, we suggest following the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) treatment algorithm to select the second line and subsequent anti‐hypertensive agents. In people with advanced CKD and treatment‐resistant hypertension (uncontrolled hypertension despite treatment with three or more agents at maximum tolerated doses including a diuretic), adding a thiazide diuretic may improve BP control.

2.2 Tier 2

Although referred to as Tier 2, the interventions in this tier may be started concurrently with the interventions in Tier 1. The main objective here is to reduce the baseline risks of CKD progression and CVD. Both Tiers 1 and 2 management should be started in primary care.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline: developing a diabetes mellitus comprehensive care plan-2022 update [^16b30200]. Endocrine Practice (2022). High credibility.

Evidence base — hypertension burden and outcomes in diabetes: The majority of individuals with DM either have elevated BP or are receiving treatment for hypertension, and once diagnosed with hypertension, an individual is 2.5 times more likely to be diagnosed with T2D within the next 5 years. The U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) demonstrated that hypertension treatment decreased both micro- and macrovascular complications of T2D, and each 10 mm Hg decrease in systolic BP was associated with a 15% reduction in DM-related mortality, an 11% reduction in myocardial infarction (MI), and a 13% reduction in the microvascular complication of retinopathy or DKD. Professional organizations have recommended that BP in persons with T2D be controlled to < 130/80 mm Hg, although the preferred goal for BP lowering remains controversial as clinical trial data to support the level of < 130/80 mm Hg are limited; epidemiologic data suggest no evidence of a threshold for adverse outcomes with a BP level < 115/75 mm Hg, and some guidelines include an option to individualize to the lower target of < 120/70 mm Hg.

### Pharmacological management of obesity: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^45c96c54]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Hypertension in obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) — preferred antihypertensives and β-blocker considerations are as follows: we recommend ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and calcium channel blockers rather than β-adrenergic blockers as first-line therapy (1|⊕⊕⊕⊕). Angiotensin is overexpressed in obesity and calcium channel blockers are effective; ACE inhibitors and ARBs have not been associated with weight gain or insulin resistance and provide renal protection in diabetes. If β-blockers are required, selective or nonselective agents with a vasodilating component such as carvedilol and nebivolol are recommended because they appear to have less weight gain potential and less impact on glucose and lipids; supporting data include a study in patients taking metoprolol tartrate compared with those taking carvedilol showing a mean weight gain of 1.1 kg and a meta-analysis reporting body weight higher in the β-blocker group with a median difference of 1.2 kg compared with control.

### First line drug treatment for hypertension and reductions in blood pressure according to age and ethnicity: cohort study in UK primary care [^b79ae637]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To study whether treatment recommendations based on age and ethnicity according to United Kingdom (UK) clinical guidelines for hypertension translate to blood pressure reductions in current routine clinical care.

Design

Observational cohort study.

Setting

UK primary care, from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2017.

Participants

New users of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB), calcium channel blockers (CCB), and thiazides.

Main Outcome Measures

Change in systolic blood pressure in new users of ACEI/ARB versus CCB, stratified by age (< v ≥ 55) and ethnicity (black v non-black), from baseline to 12, 26, and 52 week follow-up. Secondary analyses included comparisons of new users of CCB with those of thiazides. A negative outcome (herpes zoster) was used to detect residual confounding and a series of positive outcomes (expected drug effects) was used to determine whether the study design could identify expected associations.

Results

During one year of follow-up, 87440 new users of ACEI/ARB, 67274 new users of CCB, and 22040 new users of thiazides were included (median 4 (interquartile range 2–6) blood pressure measurements per user). For non-black people who did not have diabetes and who were younger than 55, CCB use was associated with a larger reduction in systolic blood pressure of 1.69 mm Hg (99% confidence interval -2.52 to -0.86) relative to ACEI/ARB use at 12 weeks, and a reduction of 0.40 mm Hg (-0.98 to 0.18) in those aged 55 and older. In subgroup analyses using six finer age categories of non-black people who did not have diabetes, CCB use versus ACEI/ARB use was associated with a larger reduction in systolic blood pressure only in people aged 75 and older. Among people who did not have diabetes, systolic blood pressure decreased more with CCB use than with ACEI/ARB use in black people (reduction difference 2.15 mm Hg (-6.17 to 1.87)); the corresponding reduction difference was 0.98 mm Hg (-1.49 to -0.47) in non-black people.

Conclusions

Similar reductions in blood pressure were found to be associated with new use of CCB as with new use of ACEI/ARB in non-black people who did not have diabetes, both in those who were aged younger than 55 and those aged 55 and older. For black people without diabetes, CCB new use was associated with numerically greater reductions in blood pressure than ACEI/ARB compared with non-black people without diabetes, but the confidence intervals were overlapping for the two groups. These results suggest that the current UK algorithmic approach to first line antihypertensive treatment might not lead to greater reductions in blood pressure. Specific indications could be considered in treatment recommendations.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^57a69a44]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Hypertension in adults — treatment thresholds and BP targets are as follows: In adults with confirmed hypertension and a 10-year ASCVD event risk of 10% or higher, a BP target of less than 130/80 mm Hg is recommended. In adults with hypertension and chronic kidney disease, treatment to a BP goal of less than 130/80 mm Hg is recommended. In adults with T2DM and hypertension, antihypertensive drug treatment should be initiated at a BP of 130/80 mm Hg or higher, with a treatment goal of less than 130/80 mm Hg. In adults with an estimated 10-year ASCVD risk < 10% and an SBP of 140 mm Hg or higher or a DBP of 90 mm Hg or higher, initiation and use of BP-lowering medication are recommended. In adults with confirmed hypertension without additional markers of increased ASCVD risk, a BP target of less than 130/80 mm Hg may be reasonable.

Additional Insights

While JNC 8 has the same treatment recommendations for people with or without diabetes, most other societies suggest that only ACEIs or ARBs should be first‐line treatment for patients with diabetes. In the case of patients with diabetes and a history of CKD, we agree that ACEIs or ARBs should be first line.

In the black population with hypertension, CCBs and thiazide diuretics generally tend to be favored as initial therapy over renin‐angiotensin system blockers. 13, 14, 45 The evidence for this recommendation comes from ALLHAT, which showed in prespecified subgroup analysis that black patients treated with lisinopril had higher rates of stroke, CVD, and HF plus 4 mm Hg higher SBP compared with those treated with chlorthalidone. 49

On the other hand, the primary and secondary outcomes were similar in the chlorthalidone and amlodipine groups except for higher rates of HF with amlodipine. Compared with lisinopril, the black patients in the amlodipine group had lower stroke rates and improved BP control. Therefore, both CCBs and thiazide diuretics are considered first line for black patients with hypertension.

If a black patient has coexisting CKD, initial treatment should be an ACEI or ARB if the patient also has albuminuria, as supported by the KDIGO guidelines. This recommendation, for starting with CCBs and thiazides is generalized to black patients with diabetes, because nearly half of the black patients in ALLHAT had diabetes. Given that most patients require > 1 agent to control hypertension, it is important to know that combination treatment with CCB or diuretics plus rennin‐angiotensin system blockade leads to the same efficacy in black or white patients. The International Society for Hypertension in Blacks suggests starting with a CCB or thiazide diuretic if < 10 mm Hg above target or using a 2‐drug approach if > 15/10 mm Hg over with a CCB or diuretic plus a rennin‐angiotensin system blocker. 13

Cardiac Control

Recommendations for the Therapeutic Management of BP

Pharmacological Treatment

Evidence suggests that treatment should be started with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI); patients who are intolerant to ACEI should receive an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). ACEIs or ARBs have beneficial effects on CV and non-CV mortality in patients with high CV risk.
BP control frequently requires a combined pharmacological treatment with a renin–angiotensin system (RAS) blocker and a calcium blocker or a thiazide-type diuretic, particularly in the presence of proteinuria and microalbuminuria.
A combination of two classes of drugs (RAS or ACEIs or ARBs combined with a calcium channel blocker or thiazide), preferably combined in a single pill for improved adherence, can be recommended as the first-line treatment. In case the dual treatment fails, a triple combination (RAS and calcium channel blocker combined with diuretic) can be considered. However, combined therapy with an ACEI and ARB must be avoided.

Controlling LDL-C

Statins are recommended as the first-line treatment at the doses required to achieve LDL-C goals.
If the LDL-C target is not achieved with statins at maximum doses, ezetimibe should be added to the treatment regimen.
In patients with high CV risk (multiple risk factors or CV history) who do not achieve target levels with a statin and ezetimibe or with intolerance to statins, a consultation with a cardiologist or endocrinologist is indicated to consider the need of protein convertase subtilisin-kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors.

Consult a Cardiologist in the Following Circumstances

The patient has a history of CVD or multiple risk factors.
If there is a suspicion or history of HF (patients presenting with dyspnea, orthopnea, fatigue, edema in extremities, irregular heartbeat, and reduced ability to exercise).
If there is a suspicion of coronary artery disease (patients presenting with pain and/or discomfort, tightness, burning sensation in chest, arms, shoulders, etc. dyspnea).
Difficult to manage patients whose hypertension is not controlled even on three different classes of hypertensives including diuretics (office BP is > 130/90 mmHg) and dyslipidemia (LDL-C of > 100 mg/dL) despite on maximum tolerated dose of statins and ezetimibe.

### Current and future status of β-blockers in the treatment of hypertension [^645c6013]. Clinical Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (beta-blockers) are effective and safe antihypertensive drugs, and have been recommended as first-line therapy for hypertension by all Joint National Committees (JNCs) for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure (BP) from the first to the last (JNC-7) in 2003. However, recently questions have been raised by several investigators regarding the antihypertensive effectiveness and safety of these drugs. The Medline literature on this subject was searched and pertinent studies were retrieved. Other pertinent references from existing publications were retrieved and analyzed up to 2007. Additionally, a historical perspective on the discovery of beta-blockers and their mechanism of action is given. Most of the reviewed short-term and long-term clinical trials demonstrate an effective and safe antihypertensive pattern for the beta-blockers. The weaknesses identified include the adverse effect of older beta-blockers on glucose control and stroke protection, especially in older persons. These adverse effects are attributed to their mechanism of action and BP effectiveness. On the basis of the evidence presented, beta-blockers are effective and safe antihypertensive drugs and should still be recommended as first-line therapy in most uncomplicated hypertensive patients, either alone or in combination with other drugs. There are reservations regarding their administration to diabetic and older hypertensive patients. However, when compelling indications for their use exist, they should not be withheld.

### Which patients benefit the most from the perindopril / amlodipine combination [^2f4f12ae]. Journal of Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Fixed-dose combinations have been strongly endorsed by European guidelines for first-line and second-line treatment of hypertension. Among recommended combinations, that of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker stands out because the mechanisms of action of these two therapeutic classes are complementary, leading to enhanced efficacy. In the large multicentre ASCOT-BPLA trial, treatment based on the combination of amlodipine and perindopril significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular and all-cause death, stroke, coronary events and procedures, new-onset diabetes, and new-onset renal impairment in a wide range of patients with hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors, when compared with atenolol/thiazide-based therapy. The perindopril/amlodipine single-pill combination was developed based on guideline recommendations for combination treatment, the indications of each component, and ASCOT-BPLA trial data. Several studies in real-life settings show that a wide range of hypertensive patients, including everyday hypertensives with common risk factors, would benefit from the perindopril/amlodipine combination.

RAAS blockade in people with type 2 diabetes without proteinuria

The use of RAAS blockade has significant benefits on cardiovascular and renal end points in people with diabetes, independent of their blood pressure lowering effect, as shown in the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) trial and the European trial on reduction of cardiac events with perindopril in stable coronary artery disease. Whereas most guidelines favour the use of RAAS blockade as first-line treatment for people with diabetes, hypertension and CKD (the American Diabetes Association, the American Society of Hypertension, the International Society of Hypertension), the European Society of Cardiology / European Society of Hypertension guidelines from 2013 and the eighth Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure from 2014 recommend the use of any class of antihypertensive agent in people with diabetes in the absence of proteinuria, but suggest the use of RAAS blockade as first-line treatment only in the presence of proteinuria.

This is based on the findings of 19 randomised controlled trials that enrolled 25,414 participants with diabetes, with a total of 95,910 patient years of follow-up. The results of this study from head-to-head randomised trials of RAAS blockade versus other antihypertensive agents failed to show superiority of RAAS blockade in people with diabetes and no proteinuria, and it suggested that any class of antihypertensive agents can be used in such individuals.

RAAS blockade in people with type 2 diabetes and proteinuria or microalbuminuria

In the UK, NICE guidance suggests offering a low-cost RAAS antagonist to people with CKD and diabetes who have: a UACR of 3 mg/mmol (26.55 mg/g) or more; hypertension and a UACR of 30 mg/mmol (265.49 mg/g) or more; or a UACR of 70 mg/mmol (619.47 mg/g) or more irrespective of hypertension or cardiovascular disease. The favourable effects of RAAS blockade have been seen mainly in placebo-controlled trials and it has been postulated that the benefits of RAAS blockade on renal outcomes was probably as a result of their blood pressure lowering effect. Several major trials have also demonstrated clear benefits of ARB use in people who have diabetic nephropathy.

### First line drug treatment for hypertension and reductions in blood pressure according to age and ethnicity: cohort study in UK primary care [^74637107]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Data

We conducted a cohort study using the Clinical Practice Research Database (CPRD-GOLD) linked to Hospital Episodes Statistics. CPRD-GOLD is a nationally representative repository of prospectively collected, anonymised electronic health records from primary care in the UK, which has been extensively validated. It holds data on demographic information, health related behaviours, test results including blood pressure measurements, diagnoses, and prescriptions for more than 11 million people. The Hospital Episodes Statistics database records all hospital admissions for patients covered by the UK's health service who receive treatment from either English NHS trusts or independent providers. Almost 60% of general practices included in CPRD-GOLD are linked to Hospital Episodes Statistics. We used linked data in this study to improve completeness of ethnicity recording.

Cohort entry

We identified new users of hypertension drugs (CCB, ACEI/ARB, and thiazides), defined as people who had a prescription for one of these drugs in the study period (1 January 2007 to 31 December 2017), with no previous use of these drugs in the preceding year. People entered the cohort (index date) on the date of the first prescription. People were eligible for inclusion from the latest of the following: study start date (1 January 2007), one year after general practice registration (to allow time for recording of covariates in the general practice record), the date when the general practices' data recording processes were considered of adequate standard to be included in CPRD-GOLD, or the person's 18th birthday. People remained in the cohort until the earliest of the following: end of the study period (31 December 2017), last data collection from the general practice, date of leaving the general practice, or death.

Exclusion

We sought to study the association between first line drug treatment for hypertension and blood pressure solely in those individuals treated for hypertension. Therefore, we excluded people who initiated any of the study drugs without recorded blood pressure measurements in the year before cohort entry, and those whose blood pressure was at target or lower (< 140/90 mm Hg, according to current NICE guidelines). We also excluded people who initiated more than one hypertension drug on the index date, as well as those with diabetes at baseline (because current NICE guidance recommends ACEI/ARB as first line hypertension treatment for all people with diabetes). Additionally, because ethnicity was a stratifying factor, we excluded people whose ethnicity was not determinable even after data linkage.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^45cf253f]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Hypertension guideline management algorithm (2014) — Adults aged ≥ 18 years with hypertension are managed by setting blood pressure goals and selecting therapy by age, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). In the general population aged ≥ 60 years, the blood pressure goal is SBP < 150 mm Hg and DBP < 90 mm Hg; in the general population aged < 60 years, the goal is SBP < 140 mm Hg and DBP < 90 mm Hg; in all ages with diabetes present without CKD, the goal is SBP < 140 mm Hg and DBP < 90 mm Hg; and in all ages with CKD present with or without diabetes, the goal is SBP < 140 mm Hg and DBP < 90 mm Hg. Initial pharmacologic therapy by race is as follows: Nonblack — Initiate thiazide-type diuretic or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) or calcium channel blocker (CCB), alone or in combination; Black — Initiate thiazide-type diuretic or CCB, alone or in combination; CKD, all races — Initiate ACEI or ARB, alone or in combination with other drug class. Therapy adjustment uses one of three titration strategies: A. Maximize first medication before adding second or B. Add second medication before reaching maximum dose of first medication or C. Start with 2 medication classes separately or as fixed-dose combination. If not at goal blood pressure, reinforce medication and lifestyle adherence and for strategies A and B add and titrate thiazide-type diuretic or ACEI or ARB or CCB (use medication class not previously selected and avoid combined use of ACEI and ARB), while for strategy C titrate doses of initial medications to maximum; if still uncontrolled, reinforce adherence and add additional medication classes (eg, β-blocker, aldosterone antagonist, or others) and/or refer to a physician with expertise in hypertension management. Note that ACEIs and ARBs should not be used in combination.
