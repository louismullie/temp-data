## Question

What are the potential side effects of long-term corticosteroid use for scalp dermatitis treatment?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the potential side effects of long-term topical corticosteroid use for scalp dermatitis and how to mitigate them. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the scalp as a unique application site and what "long-term" means in guideline context. Then, I should verify local cutaneous adverse effects and their likelihood. Next, I will examine systemic absorption and endocrine risks, including HPA axis suppression and ocular effects. After that, I should consider special populations, particularly children, and then contrast risks across steroid potencies. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-aligned risk mitigation plan and highlight safer alternatives and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: "scalp dermatitis" typically includes seborrheic dermatitis, scalp psoriasis, and sometimes overlap with atopic dermatitis on the scalp, and "long-term" generally extends beyond about 4 to 12 weeks depending on potency and regimen. The scalp has relatively thick stratum corneum but high vascularity, which influences both local tolerability and systemic absorption risk, so I need to keep both in mind as I proceed [^116Wp8v2] [^116nBgUc].

> I will now examine local cutaneous adverse effects because these dominate with chronic scalp steroid exposure: skin atrophy, telangiectasia, striae, purpura, acneiform eruptions, folliculitis, periorbital dermatitis, hypopigmentation, and burning or irritation are all established, with higher risk on chronically treated or friction-prone areas and on thinner skin such as the face or folds. Wait, let me verify that atrophy risk rises with higher potency, occlusion, and continuous use — yes, guidelines emphasize those modifiers, and they directly apply to scalp sites when steroids are left on or when the barrier is impaired [^112DydqR] [^1129Q6xg] [^116Wp8v2].

> Hold on, I should verify whether "irreversibility" is common or rare. Although some changes like striae and telangiectasia can be permanent, most atrophy is reversible after discontinuation, which aligns with clinical experience and Cochrane summaries, so I should be careful not to overstate permanence while acknowledging that scarring and pigment change can persist in some cases [^112sQs88] [^113J6fAK].

> Next, I should review systemic absorption and endocrine risks. Topical corticosteroids can cause reversible HPA axis suppression and, rarely, clinical glucocorticoid insufficiency or Cushingoid features, especially with high-potency agents, large surface area, prolonged duration, occlusion, altered barrier, and in younger patients. I need to check whether HPA suppression has been documented on the scalp specifically — FDA data for fixed calcipotriene/betamethasone and topical steroids show lab-documented suppression in a subset after 4 weeks on scalp and body, with pediatric rates higher than adults, reinforcing that cumulative exposure matters even on the scalp [^1118YpDv] [^112mvbP9].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical relevance of short-contact shampoo formulations. A clobetasol shampoo study showed no HPA suppression or atrophy after 4 weeks, suggesting that rinse-off, short-contact use reduces exposure, though this does not eliminate risk with repeated or prolonged courses, so I should not overgeneralize safety beyond the tested period and regimen [^113QMnvN].

> I need to check ocular risks because the scalp is adjacent to periocular skin. Topical steroids can increase intraocular pressure and contribute to posterior subcapsular cataracts, particularly with periorbital application or migration, so minimizing steroid use around the hairline and considering alternatives on the forehead is prudent even when treating scalp disease [^112DydqR] [^117PCaRq].

> Let me consider pediatric risk specifically. Children have higher surface-area-to-mass ratios and greater percutaneous absorption, making HPA suppression, growth effects, and Cushingoid features more likely with mid-to-high potency steroids, and pediatric guidelines recommend avoiding ultra-high potency agents on sensitive sites and limiting continuous use. I should double-check adolescent data — adolescents treated with calcipotriene/betamethasone on scalp and body showed HPA suppression in 3–16% depending on duration and BSA, underscoring the need for strict quantity limits and rotation off steroids in youth [^114kyfdP] [^112mvbP9] [^115xc87D].

> But wait, what about potency and regimen nuances? Higher potency increases atrophy and systemic risk, while short, intermittent courses with taper to lower potency and nonsteroidal maintenance mitigate harm. Proactive or weekend therapy with mid-potency steroids for eczema reduces flares without demonstrable atrophy in trials, and rotational strategies pairing vitamin D analogues with intermittent steroids are recommended for psoriasis maintenance. I should confirm that continuous, unsupervised class I use is discouraged — yes, guidelines limit class I to brief courses and specific thick-plaque sites with careful monitoring [^116Wp8v2] [^113DDob9] [^112Y46p3] [^116nBgUc].

> I should now examine alternative therapies that reduce steroid exposure on the scalp. Antifungal shampoos are first-line for seborrheic dermatitis and reduce steroid needs, topical calcineurin inhibitors can be used on hair-bearing scalp or facial margins to avoid atrophy, and vitamin D analogues alone or in combination with steroids provide steroid-sparing benefit for psoriasis. Let me verify comparative safety signals — Cochrane suggests steroids have roughly twofold more side effects than ketoconazole for seborrheic dermatitis, and TCIs carry no atrophy risk though they can burn early in therapy [^1122SeT6] [^116nvdrA] [^112Y46p3] [^111bGUaa].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about tachyphylaxis. Although tachyphylaxis is described anecdotally, high-quality trial evidence is limited, so I should frame it as a potential issue with prolonged continuous use rather than a proven inevitability, and mitigate by rotating classes and using intermittent dosing when feasible [^116nBgUc] [^113dATUJ].

> I need to ensure the practical mitigation plan is explicit and guideline-concordant: start with the lowest effective potency, avoid ultra-high potency on the face, folds, or thin scalp skin, limit continuous class I–III use to about 2–4 weeks before taper or rotation, prefer solutions, foams, or shampoos that facilitate short-contact therapy, use fingertip-unit dosing to avoid excess quantity, and monitor for atrophy, striae, telangiectasia, and signs of HPA suppression. In children, monitor growth and consider periodic cortisol testing if exposure is high, and if suppression is suspected, taper and switch to lower potency or nonsteroidal agents [^116Wp8v2] [^113qfpde] [^117PCaRq] [^113QMnvN].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought continuous class I steroids might be acceptable on the scalp for months if hair protects from occlusion. Let me reconsider — guidelines and FDA data indicate that even on the scalp, continuous high-potency use beyond a few weeks increases HPA suppression risk, especially with larger BSA or when treating adjacent forehead or neck skin, so the safer course is to rotate to nonsteroidal maintenance rather than persist with daily potent steroids [^1118YpDv] [^112mvbP9] [^116nBgUc].

> In summary, long-term topical corticosteroid therapy for scalp dermatitis carries nontrivial risks: local atrophy, telangiectasia, striae, acneiform eruptions, and periorbital changes are the most frequent, while systemic HPA suppression and rare Cushingoid effects are driven by potency, surface area, duration, occlusion, and age. Pediatric patients are uniquely vulnerable, and risk is meaningfully reduced by potency selection, intermittent dosing, rotational regimens with nonsteroidal agents, and vigilant monitoring for cutaneous and endocrine adverse effects [^112DydqR] [^1129Q6xg] [^114kyfdP] [^112Y46p3].

Prolonged use of topical corticosteroids for scalp dermatitis can cause **skin atrophy, telangiectasia, and striae** [^112DydqR] due to local effects, and **HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, and growth retardation** [^1157nSMg] from systemic absorption [^117PCaRq] [^1118YpDv]. Risk increases with higher potency, prolonged use, and occlusion; **limit duration, avoid sensitive areas, and monitor for adverse effects** [^112DydqR] [^116Wp8v2].

---

## Local side effects

Local effects are the most common and include:

- **Skin atrophy**: thinning of the scalp skin, making it fragile and prone to injury [^1129Q6xg].

- **Telangiectasia**: visible dilated blood vessels on the scalp [^112DydqR].

- **Striae**: stretch marks due to reduced collagen and elastin [^112DydqR].

- **Folliculitis**: inflammation or infection of hair follicles [^1129Q6xg].

- **Hypopigmentation**: lightening of the treated skin [^112DydqR].

- **Perioral dermatitis**: acne-like rash around the hairline or forehead [^1125o9iu].

- **Allergic contact dermatitis**: sensitization to corticosteroids or excipients [^112DydqR].

---

## Systemic side effects

Systemic effects are less common but can occur, especially with prolonged use, high-potency steroids, or application to large areas:

- **Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression**: reversible adrenal insufficiency [^117PCaRq] [^1118YpDv].

- **Cushing's syndrome**: features include moon face, central obesity, hypertension, and hyperglycemia [^117PCaRq] [^111SorqW].

- **Growth retardation**: particularly in children due to systemic absorption [^1157nSMg] [^114kyfdP].

- **Ocular effects**: posterior subcapsular cataracts and glaucoma from periocular use [^116nBgUc] [^115AQKFQ].

---

## Factors influencing risk

Several factors influence the risk and severity of side effects:

| **Factor** | **Influence on risk** |
|-|-|
| Potency of corticosteroid | Higher potency increases risk [^112DydqR] [^116Wp8v2] |
| Duration of use | Longer use increases risk [^112DydqR] [^116Wp8v2] |
| Area of application | Larger areas increase systemic absorption [^114zauNC] |
| Occlusion | Increases absorption and risk [^112DydqR] [^114zauNC] |
| Age | Children are at higher risk due to greater absorption [^114zauNC] [^114kyfdP] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines recommend:

- **Limit duration**: Use the lowest effective potency for the shortest duration [^113qfpde] [^116Wp8v2].

- **Avoid sensitive areas**: Do not use high-potency steroids on the face, intertriginous areas, or thin skin [^115gkcx6] [^116uNXib].

- **Monitor for adverse effects**: Regularly assess for local and systemic side effects [^116nBgUc] [^114zauNC].

- **Use alternatives**: Consider non-steroidal options (e.g. calcineurin inhibitors, antifungal shampoos) for long-term control [^113DDob9] [^1122SeT6].

---

## Conclusion

Prolonged topical corticosteroid use for scalp dermatitis can cause significant local and systemic side effects. Risk is minimized by using the **lowest effective potency**, limiting duration, and monitoring for adverse effects. Alternative therapies should be considered for long-term management.

5.2 Effects on Endocrine System

Calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment can cause reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for clinical glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or upon withdrawal of treatment. Factors that predispose a patient to HPA axis suppression include the use of high-potency corticosteroids, large treatment surface areas, prolonged use, concomitant use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product, use of occlusive dressings, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and young age. Evaluation for HPA axis suppression may be done by using the cosyntropin stimulation test [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

In a trial evaluating the effects of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension and calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on the HPA axis, 32 adult subjects were treated with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on the scalp and calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on the body. Adrenal suppression was identified in 5 of 32 subjects (15.6%) after 4 weeks of treatment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. The effects of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment on the HPA axis following treatment durations of longer than 4 weeks have not been adequately studied.

If HPA axis suppression is documented, gradually withdraw the drug, reduce the frequency of application, or substitute with a less potent corticosteroid.

Cushing's syndrome and hyperglycemia may also occur due to the systemic effects of topical corticosteroids. These complications are rare and generally occur after prolonged exposure to excessively large doses, especially of high-potency topical corticosteroids.

Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity due to their higher skin surface to body mass ratios [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase the total systemic corticosteroid exposure.

Atopic dermatitis — proactive topical therapy safety and scheduling: Two TCS studies did not observe adrenal suppression after the 16-week maintenance period, but a third long-term safety study of up to 44 weeks of intermittent treatment noted abnormal cosyntropin stimulation testing in 2 of 44 subjects; the risk-benefit ratio of proactive TCS use beyond 44 weeks has not been tested. For TCI, side effects were mainly application site reactions, with skin infections and nasopharyngitis also reported but seen with vehicle; continued daily TCI reduced risk of flare in long-term studies to 12 months, although efficacy versus scheduled intermittent dosing is unknown. The optimal intermittent schedule is unclear, with studies using twice weekly, 3 times weekly, or 2 consecutive days weekly, and application regimens varying from once daily to twice daily.

Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs), topical corticosteroids (TCSs), and newer agents — long-term data needs and flare prevention. Two decades of experience with TCIs in AD have answered many questions regarding safety and chronic use, and continuing to collect data on patients who have used these treatments for many years will bolster confidence among providers and their patients; furthermore, the use of TCIs in a scheduled manner for flare prevention warrants further exploration. Despite their use as first line therapy and longevity in AD treatment, many questions remain about TCSs, and gaps requiring further research include comparative data, cost effectiveness data, long-term data, safety data (particularly for high and very high potency TCSs), and use for flare prevention. Finally, for the newer topical AD treatments — PDE4 inhibitors and JAK inhibitors — long-term safety and efficacy data are welcome, efficacy and safety compared to more established treatments like TCIs and TCSs could help guide providers, and concerns about the use of topical JAK inhibitors, particularly due to systemic absorption, need clarification; long term data will better elucidate if any of the concerning side effects seen in systemic JAK inhibitors can also occur with the topical formulation.

5.3 Effects on Endocrine System

Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Suppression

Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can cause reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for clinical glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or upon withdrawal of treatment. Factors that predispose a patient to HPA axis suppression include the use of high-potency steroids, large treatment surface areas, prolonged use, use of occlusive dressings, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and young age.

Evaluation for HPA axis suppression may be done by using the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test. If HPA axis suppression is documented, gradually withdraw Enstilar Foam, reduce the frequency of application, or substitute with a less potent corticosteroid.

The following trials evaluated the effects of Enstilar Foam on HPA axis suppression [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]:

In a trial evaluating the effects of Enstilar Foam on the HPA axis, 35 adult subjects applied Enstilar Foam on the body and scalp. Adrenal suppression was not observed in any subjects after 4 weeks of treatment.
In another trial, 33 adolescent subjects age 12 to 17 years applied Enstilar Foam on the body and scalp. Adrenal suppression occurred in 3 (9%) of the subjects.
In a trial, 21 subjects aged 18 years and older with plaque psoriasis applied Enstilar Foam once daily for 4 weeks and then twice weekly on 2 non-consecutive days for 52 weeks, including once daily for 4 weeks if loss of response occurred. Adrenal suppression was observed in 2 (10%) of the subjects.

Cushing's Syndrome and Hyperglycemia

Systemic effects of topical corticosteroids may also include Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria.

Additional Considerations for Endocrine Adverse Reactions

Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase the total systemic corticosteroid exposure.

5.4 Allergic Contact Dermatitis

Allergic contact dermatitis has been observed with topical calcipotriene and topical corticosteroids. Allergic contact dermatitis to a topical corticosteroid is usually diagnosed by observing a failure to heal rather than a clinical exacerbation. Corroborate such an observation with appropriate diagnostic patch testing.

### The safety and efficacy of tacrolimus ointment in pediatric patients with atopic dermatitis [^111oS8je]. Pediatric Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common skin disease in children, and its prevalence is increasing. It is a chronic disorder, characterized by intermittent flares and phases of remission. Treatment regimens often require multiple therapies. These can vary between patients, and in an individual patient, depending on the state of disease. The traditional treatment for AD flares is topical corticosteroids, which are fast acting and effective for relief of symptoms, but may cause adverse effects, including those resulting from systemic absorption, particularly in children. Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) are alternative treatments for AD. Tacrolimus ointment, a TCI, is approved for patients aged 2 years and older. Multiple studies have shown that tacrolimus is effective for short-term relief of symptoms in pediatric patients with AD. Long-term trials have demonstrated that the effectiveness of tacrolimus is maintained for up to 4 years in children. Additional studies have revealed that long-term intermittent use of tacrolimus as part of maintenance therapy can prevent AD flares. Tacrolimus has a low potential for systemic accumulation, and analysis of long-term studies indicates that it has a good safety profile. Treatment with tacrolimus, alone or in combination with topical corticosteroids for acute flares, may be a useful option for long-term management of AD in pediatric patients.

well-controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects from topically applied corticosteroids. Therefore, topical corticosteroids should be

used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Drugs of this class should not be used extensively on

pregnant patients, in large amounts, or for prolonged periods of time.

Nursing Mothers

It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce

detectable quantities in breast milk. Systemically administered corticosteroids are secreted into breast milk in quantities not likely to have a

deleterious effect on the infant. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when topical corticosteroids are administered to a nursing

woman.

Pediatric Use

Pediatric patients may demonstrate greater susceptibility to topical corticosteroid-induced HPA axis suppression and Cushing's

syndrome than mature patients because of a larger skin surface area to body weight ratio.

Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, Cushings's syndrome and intracranial hypertension have been reported in

children receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain,

low plasma cortisol levels, and absence of response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles,

headaches, and bilateral papilledema.

Administration of topical corticosteroids to children should be limited to the least amount compatible with an effective

therapeutic regimen. Chronic corticosteroid therapy may interfere with the growth and development of children.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following local adverse reactions are reported infrequently with topical corticosteroids, but may occur more frequently

with the use of occlusive dressings. These reactions are listed in an approximate decreasing order of occurrence:

### Mucocutaneous manifestations in juvenile-onset systemic lupus erythematosus: a review of literature [^117SHwkA]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Management

Careful assessment of systemic disease status is first needed, as inducing disease remission will lead to resolution of the mucocutaneous lesions. Treatment is tailored to disease severity and organ involvement. In limited cutaneous disease, topical corticosteroids may be helpful. In more extensive disease or where there is systemic involvement, short courses of systemic corticosteroids with concurrent use of hydroxychloroquine and/or immunosuppressive therapies are indicated. Table 2 summarizes the commonly used treatments of mucocutaneous lesions and their common side effects in JSLE patients.

Table 2
Summary of commonly used treatment in mucocutaneous lupus lesions in juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus (JSLE)

Sunscreen

Mucocutaneous lupus lesions are generally highly photosensitive, triggered by both UVA and UVB. Children are advised to avoid prolonged sun exposure and routinely wear protective clothing (including hats). Very potent physical and chemical sunscreens include: titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, tocopheryl acetate and flavonoids. These can be used in children, particularly before direct sun exposure. Children in tropical countries may have some difficulties of sun avoidance; thus, parents as well as school teachers are encouraged to be vigilant about UV protection. Lack of sun exposure in affected individuals can sometimes result in low vitamin D levels; if so, vitamin D3 and calcium supplements should be considered.

Corticosteroids

Topical corticosteroids are commonly used in JSLE patients as they are very effective for mucocutaneous lupus lesions. High potency corticosteroids are necessary to induce remission of the lesions. This can then be followed by gradual tapering of the dose to discontinuation. Mild to moderate potency corticosteroids are usually applied to lesions on the face and body. However, calcineurin inhibitors are preferred in delicate areas (e.g. around the eyes, groin and genitalia) for more prolonged use to prevent skin thinning. If the lesions are part of JSLE, then they will only be improved along with the systemic therapies used to control the disease. In this group, treatments should be more focused on controlling the systemic disease.

An intralesional corticosteroid injection can be used in adolescents with DLE, particularly on the scalp, to minimize the scarring alopecia, whilst systemic corticosteroids are very helpful in the short term of induce remission of severe mucocutaneous lesions (e.g. multiple oral ulcers, or severe cutaneous vasculitis with ulceration and necrosis). However, these should be avoided for prolonged periods due to serious side effects. Therefore, the affected areas, the route of administration, the potency of corticosteroids, length of treatment and any side effects should be carefully considered, particularly in JSLE patients.

### Triamcinolone acetonide, dimethicone (scarzen) [^117FqPxz]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy Category C

Corticosteroids are generally teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. The more potent corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals. There are not adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects from topically applied corticosteroids. Therefore, topical corticosteroids should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Drugs of this class should not be used extensively on pregnant patients, in large amounts, or for prolonged periods of time.

Nursing Mothers

It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk. Systemically administered corticosteroids are secreted into breast milk in quantities not likely to have a deleterious effect on the infant.

OVERDOSAGE

Topically applied corticosteroids can be absorbed in sufficient amounts to produce systemic effects (See PRECAUTIONS).

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Topical corticosteroids are generally applied to the affected area as a thin film from two to three times daily depending on the severity of the condition.

Occlusive dressing may be used for the management of psoriasis or recalcitrant conditions.

If an infection develops, the use of occlusive dressing should be discontinued and appropriate antimicrobial therapy instituted.

Rationale and scope — The Work Group determined that the overall balance of benefits and potential harms as reported at 57 days favors using tirbanibulin for the management of AKs on the face and scalp and that the certainty of the available short-term evidence is high. Future availability of long-term safety data may impact the direction or strength of the recommendation, and the Work Group recognizes that the evidence is restricted to the treatment of a limited field applicable for commonly affected smaller areas such as the central scalp, forehead, or cheek. The Work Group recommends the use of topical tirbanibulin for the management of AK.

### Immunologic adverse effects of biologics for the treatment of atopy [^1147zHrP]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

The use of biologic agents as therapies for atopic diseases such as asthma and atopic dermatitis has increased greatly in recent years. The biological agents used to treat atopic diseases are for the most part monoclonal antibodies that suppress the immune response and reduce inflammation by targeting particular cytokines or other molecules involved in Th1, Th2, or Th17 immune reactions. Various side effects and rare complications have been reported from these agents. In this review, we discuss mechanisms of various adverse effects for the biologic agents currently in use or in development for atopic and inflammatory diseases. Monoclonal antibodies targeting the Th1 and Th17 pathways have been associated with significant side effects, partially due to their ability to cause significant impairment in immune responses to pathogens because of the immunologic alterations that they produce. Biologicals targeting Th2-mediated inflammation have had fewer reported side effects, though many are new and emerging drugs whose adverse effects may remain to be fully elucidated with more use. Therefore, continued long-term safety monitoring is required. As with all therapies, the risks associated with side effects of biologics must be balanced against the benefits these drugs offer for treating atopic diseases. One of the most apparent benefits is the steroid-sparing effect of well-chosen biologic therapy used to treat severe atopic disease. In contrast with the quite favorable safety profile of currently available biologics that target the Th2-mediated immune response, chronic systemic corticosteroid use is associated with significant side effects, many of which impact the majority of patients who are placed on long-term steroid therapy.

### Three times weekly tacrolimus ointment reduces relapse in stabilized atopic dermatitis: a new paradigm for use [^116qNLph]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Long-term, safe and effective therapeutic options for managing the chronic relapsing nature of atopic dermatitis are essential for improving patient quality of life. To minimize the risks of continued topical corticosteroid usage and potentially reduce the incidence of flares, we tested the efficacy and safety of a rotational paradigm of initial brief application of topical corticosteroid followed by long-term intermittent application of non-steroidal tacrolimus ointment to previously inflamed sites of dermatitis.

Methods

In this 2-phase study, patients who were 2 to 15 years of age and had moderate to severe atopic dermatitis were randomly assigned to 4 days of twice-daily double-blind therapy with either alclometasone ointment 0.05% or tacrolimus ointment 0.03% (Phase I acute), followed by up to 16 weeks of twice-daily open-label tacrolimus ointment 0.03% (Phase I short-term). Patients whose disease stabilized underwent new randomization to double-blind tacrolimus ointment 0.03% or vehicle applied once daily, 3 times per week to clinically normal-appearing skin for up to 40 weeks (Phase II). Corticosteroid use was prohibited.

Results

Of 206 randomly assigned patients, 152 completed Phase I; 105 of 152 were randomly assigned into Phase II (68 tacrolimus ointment and 37 vehicle). There were no differences in adverse events between alclometasone and tacrolimus (Phase I) or between tacrolimus and vehicle (Phase II). In the acute period, alclometasone-treated patients showed greater improvement in atopic dermatitis signs and symptoms; thereafter, when all patients applied tacrolimus ointment (short-term), there were no differences. In Phase II, tacrolimus-treated patients had significantly more disease-free days compared with vehicle, significantly longer time to first relapse, and significantly fewer disease relapse days.

Conclusions

For patients with stabilized moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, long-term intermittent application of tacrolimus ointment to normal-appearing but previously affected skin was significantly more effective than vehicle at maintaining disease stabilization, with a safety profile similar to vehicle.

Pediatric psoriasis — calcipotriene combinations and steroid-sparing strategies: Pretreating involved skin with 6% to 10% salicylic acid for 1 week may enhance the efficacy of subsequent calcipotriene monotherapy, but care is required because the acid pH of salicylic acid will inactivate calcipotriene when the 2 are given simultaneously; combination calcipotriene and betamethasone may result in adverse effects (such as striae and HPA axis suppression) and maximum weekly dosage guidelines should be followed, whereas rotational therapy with topical vitamin D analogues, TCIs, emollients, tar-based therapies, and topical corticosteroids should be considered in children as steroid-sparing regimens to reduce potential adverse effects from overreliance on topical steroid therapy.

### Pimecrolimus cream 1% vs. betamethasone 17-valerate 0.1% cream in the treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis. A randomized open-label clinical trial [^112yF4rs]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Seborrhoeic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory disease with remissions and exacerbations, characterized by erythema, scaling and pruritus primarily on the face, scalp and chest. Corticosteroids and antifungals are the mainstay of therapy. However, chronic use of corticosteroids is associated with side-effects such as skin atrophy and telangiectasia. Pimecrolimus, an inhibitor of calcineurin, has been used successfully in one patient with seborrhoeic dermatitis.

Objectives

The objective of this randomized open-label clinical trial was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of pimecrolimus in comparison with a potent corticosteroid (betamethasone 17-valerate) in the treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis.

Methods

Twenty patients with seborrhoeic dermatitis were included in this study, 11 patients in the pimecrolimus 1% cream group and nine patients in the betamethasone 17-valerate 0.1% cream group. Patients were instructed to use a thin layer of the study products twice daily at the lesional area and to discontinue treatment as soon as symptoms were absent. Clinical measures assessed were erythema, scaling and pruritus which were evaluated using a four-point scale (0–3).

Results

Both pimecrolimus and betamethasone were highly effective in the treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis. Betamethasone reduced all three parameters, erythema, scaling and pruritus, faster than pimecrolimus, but the differences in reduction were not statistically significant. Relapses were observed more frequently and were more severe with betamethasone than with pimecrolimus. Moreover, pruritus was not observed after discontinuation of treatment from day 15 and beyond in the pimecrolimus group, whereas it was reported in most patients of the betamethasone group. This difference was statistically significant.

Conclusions

It appears that pimecrolimus, a nonsteroidal topical treatment, may be an excellent alternative therapeutic modality for treating seborrhoeic dermatitis.

5.1 Effects on Endocrine System

Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or after withdrawal of treatment. Manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can also be produced in some patients by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids while on treatment. Factors that predispose a patient using a topical corticosteroid to HPA axis suppression include the use of high potency steroids, large treatment surface areas, prolonged use, use of occlusive dressing, altered skin barrier, liver failure and young age.

Because of the potential for systemic absorption, use of topical corticosteroids may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. This may be done by using the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test.

In a study evaluating the effects of mometasone furoate lotion on the HPA axis, 15 mL were applied without occlusion twice daily (30 mL per day) for 7 days to 4 adult subjects with scalp and body psoriasis. At the end of treatment, the plasma cortisol levels for each of the 4 subjects remained within the normal range and changed little from baseline.

If HPA axis suppression is documented, an attempt should be made to gradually withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

5.2 Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions

Use of topical corticosteroids may increase the risk of posterior subcapsular cataracts and glaucoma. Cataracts and glaucoma have been reported in postmarketing experience with the use of topical corticosteroid products, including the topical mometasone products [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Avoid contact of Mometasone furoate lotion with eyes. Advise patients to report any visual symptoms and consider referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation.

5.3 Allergic Contact Dermatitis

If irritation develops, mometasone furoate lotion should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Allergic contact dermatitis with corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing failure to heal rather than noting a clinical exacerbation. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic patch testing.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^111YiGKA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Skin infections

Four trials that compared second‐generation topical corticosteroid versus older topical corticosteroid for two to 16 weeks' duration reported the number of participants with skin infections (Kirkup 2003a; Kirkup 2003b; Ryu 1997; Vernon 1991; Analysis 6.17). There were three reports of skin infections across the second‐generation topical corticosteroid compared with four in the control, older topical corticosteroid groups (464 participants) and there was no more than one participant per arm in each trial with an adverse event. One Staphylococcus aureus infection of the scalp in the second‐generation group resulted in discontinuation from the trial (Vernon 1991; children with moderate to severe eczema).

Other local adverse events

One trial, of 42 days' duration, reported hair growth in one participant who used second‐generation potent topical corticosteroid (Prado de Oliveira 2002; 25 participants).

Safety: number of relevant systemic adverse events (secondary outcome)

Seven trials reported on systemic adverse events.

Four trials of three to six weeks' duration reported on the number of participants with abnormal cortisol levels (Hoybye 1991; Rafanelli 1993; Vernon 1991; Wolkerstorfer 1998; Analysis 6.18). In the trials that provided exact numbers of participants (Rafanelli 1993; Vernon 1991; Wolkerstorfer 1998), none had abnormal cortisol in the second‐generation topical corticosteroid group (65 participants) compared to two in the older topical corticosteroid group (63 participants).

Three trials reported that no relevant systemic adverse events occurred (Kirkup 2003b; Marchesi 1994; Prado de Oliveira 2002).

Unspecified adverse events (safety)

Nolting 1991 looked for adverse events, in addition to skin thinning reported above, however, the trial authors report that no other significant adverse events occurred.

Also in addition to the skin thinning data reported above, Hoybye 1991 found that "Treatment‐related side effects were few, and these were similar in both patient groups". These adverse events were reported to be stinging, burning, itching, dryness, acne, folliculitis, and hair growth.

Branded topical corticosteroid versus generic topical corticosteroid

We found no trials that involved the use of this strategy.

### Guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. section 3. guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with topical therapies [^113qfpde]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Psoriasis topical corticosteroids — precautions, dosing limits, and systemic effects: Local cutaneous side effects, which occur more frequently than systemic side effects, are more commonly seen at steroid-sensitive sites, including the face and intertriginous areas, as well as in any areas that are treated over the long term; these include skin atrophy, telangiectasia, striae distensae, acne, folliculitis, and purpura, and rebound can occur wherein disease recurs worse than the pretreatment baseline after discontinuation. Systemic side effects, although infrequent, may occur, with the greatest risk when ultra-high-potency or high-potency corticosteroids are used over a large surface for a prolonged period or under occlusion; the continuous use of class I topical corticosteroids should normally be limited to no more than twice daily for up to 2 to 4 weeks and no more than 50 g/wk. Although symptomatic hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression is a relatively uncommon side effect, laboratory evidence is more common with more potent agents, and in two distinct studies, 20% of patients treated with clobetasol ointment (class I) had laboratory evidence for HPA suppression compared to 3% with desonide ointment (class VI). Infants and younger children are at increased risk of local and systemic side effects, all topical corticosteroids are pregnancy category C and of unknown safety in nursing women, and approaches to minimize side effects include transitioning to weaker potency agents after clinical improvement and intermittent usage (weekend only).

### Long-term use of oral corticosteroids and safety outcomes for patients with atopic dermatitis [^114tY3Yn]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

For individual outcomes, in line with previous studies, we also identified fracture, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and myocardial infarction as AEs associated with long-term use of oral corticosteroids, owing to interruption of endocrine function and metabolism. We observed risks of AVN and cataract with long-term oral corticosteroid use, although the risks of these 2 conditions were inconclusive in past studies. For the underlying mechanisms for AVN of the femoral head, the use of oral corticosteroids leads to intravascular coagulation that results in a inhibition of blood flow to the bones, which consequently triggers ischemic injury. Although existing evidence regarding an association of AVN with duration of oral corticosteroid treatment is unclear, AVN could be induced from use of just over 30 days, and cumulative exposure is the important determining factor, as shown in our results. Furthermore, although a complete elucidation remains uncertain, the mechanisms of new-onset cataract associated with modest long-term use of oral corticosteroids may be due to disturbances in osmotic equilibrium, oxidative detriment, and perturbations in lens growth factors. Another potential hypothesis involves nonenzymatic Schiff base intermediates that form between the corticosteroid's C-20 ketone group and its nucleophilic groups, undergoing Heyns rearrangement to produce stable amine-substituted adducts seen only in corticosteroid-induced posterior subcapsular cataracts. No association or subtle increased hazard was observed with osteoporosis, glaucoma, stroke, or heart failure, implying that the dose and duration of corticosteroid treatment may not pose a risk for these conditions among patients with AD.

Atopic dermatitis in adults — bone health — has a limited but consistent evidence base linking AD to adverse bone health, including osteoporosis and fractures, and the mechanism is unclear but systemic corticosteroids, which are known to increase fracture risk and are sometimes prescribed to treat AD and comorbid asthma, may play a role.

### The role of topical calcineurin inhibitors in atopic dermatitis [^111BxW5W]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

For more than five decades, topical corticosteroids and emollients have been the mainstay of therapy for atopic dermatitis. However, the potential for side-effects limits the clinical utility of corticosteroids in providing long-term disease control. With a unique mode of action that differs from that of corticosteroids, the steroid-free topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs), tacrolimus ointment and pimecrolimus cream, provide skin-selective treatment that targets key factors involved in the pathogenesis of this chronic disease. An extensive series of clinical trials involving more than 16,000 patients with predominantly moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in tacrolimus studies and over 2000 patients with primarily mild to moderate disease in pimecrolimus studies has shown that both TCIs provide effective and well-tolerated treatment for atopic dermatitis. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that tacrolimus is superior to conventional hydrocortisone-based regimens and does not cause skin atrophy or other steroidal side-effects. Both tacrolimus and pimecrolimus prevent disease flares and provide progressive and sustained disease improvement with long-term therapy. These and other clinical benefits of TCIs are discussed, together with the safety profiles of tacrolimus and pimecrolimus and their use in clinical practice. In addition, this review summarizes findings from the many trials carried out with these agents and outlines how TCIs can provide long-term treatment and control of a chronic skin disease that may persist for years.

Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Topical corticosteroids (TCS) — topical corticosteroids (also called topical steroids) are the mainstay of therapy for AD, and in patients with uncontrolled AD refractory to moisturization alone, the JTF panel recommends addition of a TCS with high-certainty evidence. In randomized clinical trials mostly for 2 to 6 weeks, TCS probably did not importantly increase adverse effects. Avoid high-potency (classes 1 and 2) TCS for prolonged continuous periods of time (> 4 weeks) and limit use on sensitive areas (face, folds, groin); continuous and prolonged use of lower potency TCS on sensitive areas can also cause these effects. After addressing active disease, TCSs are strongly recommended for continued intermittent therapy to prevent future flares.

### Topical noncorticosteroid immunomodulation in the treatment of atopic dermatitis [^1159wTcg]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

At present, the first-line drugs for treating atopic dermatitis are topical corticosteroids. They are effective when used short-term; however, long-term use of the corticosteroids is associated with suppressive effects on the connective tissue, seen as skin atrophy or resistance to therapy. Currently, two topical noncorticosteroid immunomodulators tacrolimus (FK506) and pimecrolimus (SDZ ASM 981) are under development, or already on the market in some countries for atopic dermatitis. These two compounds show structural similarity. In T lymphocytes they bind to the same cellular receptor, the FK-binding protein (FKBP) or macrophilin-12. Tacrolimus shows a 3-fold greater affinity to FKBP compared with pimecrolimus. The tacrolimus/ pimecrolimus-FKBP complex further binds to calcineurin, an enzyme vital for the early activation of T cells. The consequence of calcineurin binding is a lack of activation of both T helper cell types 1 and 2. Further effects of these compounds have been suggested on other inflammatory cells, such as Langerhans cells and mast cells/basophils. In contrast to corticosteroids, no suppressive effects on connective tissue cells have been observed. Taken together, treatment of inflammation results in healing of the barrier function of the skin. This again results in reduced bioavailability of the drug, as compared with systemic use. Placebo-controlled studies have shown the efficacy of both tacrolimus (at 0.03 and 0.1%) and pimecrolimus (at 0.6 and 1%). The main adverse event in these studies has been a burning sensation and increased pruritus at the site of application. Typically, these adverse events are observed only during the first days of treatment. Long-term safety studies, of up to one year, have not revealed any new adverse events. So far, long-term use of topical noncorticosteroid compounds has not been associated with signs of immune deficiency. Although there is currently no evidence for clinically relevant, prolonged adverse effects, some of these, such as an increased risk of photocarcinogenesis, need to be monitored. There is evidence from tacrolimus studies that monotherapy results in better long-term results when compared with combination therapy with corticosteroids. Tacrolimus and pimecrolimus could replace topical corticosteroids as the first-line treatment of atopic dermatitis.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^112sQs88]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Local side effects of topical corticosteroids include the possibility of skin atrophy (skin thinning), striae (stretch marks) and purpura (discolouration). To a degree, thinning can be a desirable effect of topical corticosteroid use in restoring abnormally thickened eczematous skin. Abnormal skin thinning, however, can lead to bruising, tearing, and small blood vessels becoming more visible. It has been reported that the skin can recover once topical corticosteroids are stopped (Eichenfield 2014b). Systemic side effects include hypothalamic pituitary axis suppression and growth suppression (Callen 2007). Skin thinning and effects on growth and development have been reported to be the main concerns amongst people using topical corticosteroids (Li 2017). Side effects of topical corticosteroids are thought to be rare in usual practice and are more likely to occur if topical corticosteroids have been used inappropriately, such as continuous use or if potent corticosteroids are applied to areas with high permeability, such as eyelids (Callen 2007; Nankervis 2016). This inappropriate use could lead to systemic side effects such as hypothalamic pituitary axis suppression or hyperglycaemia (Gilbertson 1998). But, despite their relative safety, concerns and confusion about the use of topical corticosteroids amongst people with eczema and the healthcare professionals who treat them are widespread. Negative beliefs about the use of topical corticosteroids are thought to contribute to poor treatment adherence (Aubert‐Wastiaux 2011; Li 2017; Teasdale 2017).

2 METHODS

PubMed literature searches were conducted with the following terms: psoriasis and face/facial, psoriasis and palmoplantar, psoriasis and intertriginous or inverse, psoriasis and genital, psoriasis and scalp, and psoriasis and nail. Abstracts from English‐language articles in the last 10 years were screened for relevance.

2.1 Scalp

Scalp involvement occurs in 45–56% of individuals with psoriasis (Merola, Li, et al. 2016). It is typically among the first affected areas of the body, with the frequency of lesion formation increasing with disease duration. The diagnosis of scalp psoriasis can be delayed due to overlapping features with other papulosquamous disorders of the scalp, particularly seborrheic dermatitis (Treadwell, 2011). Psoriasis lesions on the scalp are usually asymmetrical and sharply demarcated, and exhibit silvery‐white scaling.

The symptoms of scalp psoriasis can result in decreased QoL by causing pain, itching, bleeding, feelings of embarrassment, and restricting clothing choices (Sampogna, Linder, et al. 2014). QoL is more adversely affected in women than men, and individuals younger than 40 years are more adversely affected compared with patients 60 years or older (Sampogna, Linder, et al. 2014).

Common treatment options for patients with scalp psoriasis include topical agents such as vitamin D analogs, corticosteroids, and coal tar. However, these agents are challenging to use on the scalp because hair makes application burdensome, and many patients find them cosmetically unacceptable (Menter et al. 2011). These issues can lead to nonadherence and dissatisfaction with treatment options.

In a recent systematic review of topical therapies for chronic plaque psoriasis of the scalp, vitamin D and corticosteroid combination therapy, and corticosteroid monotherapy were found to be more effective and safer than vitamin D monotherapy (Schlager et al. 2016). However, monotherapy with generic topical steroids may be acceptable for short‐term therapy due to the slim efficacy benefit of vitamin D and corticosteroid combination therapy over steroid therapy alone. Targeted phototherapy with an excimer laser can provide an effective alternative to topical therapy when used with a blower device that displaces hair (Menter et al. 2010).

Question 3: What is the first-line treatment for acute lesions of LCLE?
A. Topical corticosteroids or intralesional corticosteroids
B. Tacrolimus
C. Hydroxychloroquine
D. Oral retinoids
E. Dapsone

Answers:
A. Topical corticosteroids – Correct. Topical or intralesional corticosteroids have been the mainstay for LCLE lesions as initial treatment in most cases results in moderate-to-significant improvement of the lesions.
B. Tacrolimus – Incorrect. Although topical calcineurin inhibitors like tacrolimus are also commonly reported treatments for LCLE, it is more commonly used as a long-term maintenance therapy to avoid the unwanted side effects of chronic corticosteroid therapy.
C. Hydroxychloroquine – Incorrect. Hydroxychloroquine may be effective for long-term therapy in patients for whom topical treatments have failed to reduce symptoms and lesions.
D. Oral retinoids – Incorrect. Oral retinoids are considered second-line therapies. The systemic retinoids have teratogenic effects and long-term risk of hypertriglyceridemia and bone abnormalities.
E. Dapsone – Incorrect. Systemic dapsone is used in cases of refractory lesions; however, it is a less popular alternative because of its side effects.

Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Atopic dermatitis — systemic corticosteroids harms and panel rationale — Less than 30 days of oral corticosteroids, for any indication, is associated with sepsis (IRR, 5.3 [95% CI, 3.80–7.41]; 5 vs 1 per 1000), venous thromboembolism (IRR, 3.33 [2.78–3.99]; 8 vs 2 per 1000), and fracture (IRR, 1.87 [1.69–2.07]; 27 vs 14 per 1000). Common adverse events in patients with AD using systemic corticosteroids include rebound flares shortly after drug discontinuation, weight gain, insomnia, adrenal insufficiency, and growth impairment, and clinical experts report repeated cycles rather than accessing safer and more effective long-term control strategies; for multiple indications, repeated cycles of short-term (< 7 days) systemic corticosteroids and long-term systemic corticosteroid use cause a range of common and serious harms. Trials often reported that benefits were transient with disease activity rebounding on discontinuation, and the significant harms and burdens relative to low certainty benefits drove the conditional recommendation and supported against their routine use for flare management or bridge therapy.

### New topical and systemic treatments for atopic dermatitis [^113qCGXt]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Topical Treatments

Topical treatment options for atopic dermatitis have greatly expanded over the past 25 years. Topical corticosteroids have been the mainstay of therapy for decades and remain important first‐line treatments for most children and adults with atopic dermatitis. However, their clinical benefit is limited in some instances by the potential for local adverse events (AEs), particularly in sensitive anatomic locations such as the face and folds. Additionally, while topical corticosteroids are safe and effective for most people when used properly, patient concerns over AEs may negatively impact adherence.

The introduction of the topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs), tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, in the early 2000s was a major development for the treatment of atopic dermatitis, giving patients the first non‐corticosteroid topical anti‐inflammatory treatment option. TCIs work by blocking both Th(T helper cell)1 and Th2 immune responses and reduce inflammation and improve the skin barrier without the risk of atrophy. TCIs are not effective for all patients, particularly for more severe lesions of atopic dermatitis, and are limited by application‐site discomfort. Fortunately, the development of TCIs paved the way for other non‐steroidal targeted topical therapies.

### Pimecrolimus: a review of its use in atopic dermatitis [^111tKnKF]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Pimecrolimus (Elidel) is a topically active, nonsteroid, calcineurin inhibitor that has shown efficacy in controlling symptoms of atopic dermatitis in adult and pediatric patients. Topical pimecrolimus 1% cream is approved in the US for the short-term and intermittent long-term treatment of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis in non-immunocompromised patients aged ≥ 2 years who do not respond well to, or may have adverse effects with, conventional treatments. Pimecrolimus 1% cream is an effective and well tolerated treatment for atopic dermatitis in infants, children, adolescents, and adults. Pimecrolimus is effective at reducing the incidence of disease flares and, thus, the need for rescue treatment with topical corticosteroids. The drug also improves the health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) of children and adolescents, and improves the QOL of parents of children with atopic dermatitis. Furthermore, pimecrolimus does not cause skin atrophy, a problem commonly associated with topical corticosteroids, and is not associated with clinically relevant systemic adverse events. Thus, topical pimecrolimus 1% cream is an effective treatment option for the management of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis.

Clobetasol propionate is known to be a very effective treatment for psoriasis; however, its use is limited by potent corticosteroid class related side effects such as hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression and atrophogenicity. The aim of this single-center, parallel group, randomized study was to assess the HPA axis suppression potential, atrophogenicity, and ocular tolerability of clobetasol propionate shampoo in 26 patients with scalp psoriasis. Suitable subjects were treated once daily for 4 weeks with clobetasol propionate shampoo, to be rinsed off after 15 minutes or with a leave-on clobetasol propionate gel. The study demonstrated that clobetasol propionate shampoo did not lead to HPA axis suppression or to skin atrophy. Conversely, the gel led to HPA axis suppression and a decrease in skin thickness. Neither formulation had an impact on ocular safety. Despite the short contact application time, the clobetasol propionate shampoo provides similar efficacy results to the gel.

### Diagnosis and treatment of seborrheic dermatitis [^1122SeT6]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis is a common skin condition in infants, adolescents, and adults. The characteristic symptoms-scaling, erythema, and itching-occur most often on the scalp, face, chest, back, axilla, and groin. Seborrheic dermatitis is a clinical diagnosis based on the location and appearance of the lesions. The skin changes are thought to result from an inflammatory response to a common skin organism, Malassezia yeast. Treatment with antifungal agents such as topical ketoconazole is the mainstay of therapy for seborrheic dermatitis of the face and body. Because of possible adverse effects, anti-inflammatory agents such as topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors should be used only for short durations. Several over-the-counter shampoos are available for treatment of seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp, and patients should be directed to initiate therapy with one of these agents. Antifungal shampoos (long-term) and topical corticosteroids (short-term) can be used as second-line agents for treatment of scalp seborrheic dermatitis.

### A comparison of topical corticosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitors for the treatment of atopic dermatitis [^111JYnve]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Topical corticosteroids (TCS) are a mainstay of treatment for atopic dermatitis (AD). There are shared physician and patient concerns that TCS use can result in skin atrophy and systemic absorption. The clinical use of topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) for AD is relatively limited despite evidence that TCI are safe and effective. Understanding the differences in efficacy and adverse effects between TCS and TCI can help shape prescription practices to the benefit of patients. The objective of this review is to characterize the difference in efficacy and adverse effects between TCS and TCI. A review of the literature between 2002 and 2022 was performed using the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases. Ten studies comparing TCS of varying potencies with TCI approved for AD treatment were included in the review. Outcome measures were qualified using percent reductions on the modified Eczema Area and Severity Index score and decreases in physician's global evaluation of AD severity. Tacrolimus had statistically significant (P < .05) improvement in disease severity compared with TCS in 4 of the 5 studies that compared tacrolimus with weak TCS. The data suggest greater treatment efficacy of tacrolimus over weak TCS, and inferior efficacy of pimecrolimus (TCI) compared with both tacrolimus and weak TCS. It is difficult to draw conclusions between moderate, potent, and very potent TCS and TCI due to the small number of available studies. TCI can improve disease severity, especially on thin or intertriginous skin regions most vulnerable to adverse events with TCS treatment, and their use may help overcome adherence issues due to patient bias against TCS.

### Remission of alopecia universalis in a patient with atopic dermatitis treated with dupilumab [^115A6nBL]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 35-year-old woman presented with a history of AD since childhood, an 8-year history of AA with progression to alopecia universalis, and a 5-year history of chronic urticaria. She had undergone treatment with class I topical steroids, intermittent oral corticosteroids, omalizumab, and cyclosporine. The topical corticosteroids and omalizumab were ineffective in controlling her AD, AA, and urticaria. Cyclosporine at 5 mg/kg/d resulted in mild improvement in her AD. In addition, she grew sparse, patchy hair to her scalp only, which was not sustained after the medication was tapered and withdrawn. Five years after initial presentation, she started treatment for her progressive and treatment-refractory AD with dupilumab, 300 mg injected subcutaneously every 2 weeks. This therapy resulted in significant improvement in her pruritus and atopic dermatitis. After 6 months of therapy, she noted patchy hair recovery that rapidly progressed to full, thick regrowth of terminal hairs on her entire scalp by 12 months (Fig 1). In addition, she noted eyebrow, axillary, and pubic hair growth, which had not occurred with prior therapies. Comparative photographs of these body sites are unavailable. She experienced no significant side effects associated with the dupilumab therapy. At 1-year follow-up, she had a sustained response on maintenance therapy with dupilumab.

### Betamethasone valerate foam (betamethasone valerate) [^114zauNC]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

General

Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has caused reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment. Manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can also be produced in some patients by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids while on treatment.

Conditions which augment systemic absorption include the application of the more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, prolonged use, and the addition of occlusive dressings.

Therefore, patients applying a topical steroid to a large surface area or to areas under occlusion should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression. If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid.

Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency may occur requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. For information on systemic supplementation, see prescribing information for those products.

Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios. (See PRECAUTIONS-Pediatric Use .)

If irritation develops, betamethasone valerate foam, 0.12% should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Allergic contact dermatitis with corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing a failure to heal rather than noting a clinical exacerbation, as with most topical products not containing corticosteroids. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic patch testing.

In the presence of dermatological infections, the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of betamethasone valerate foam, 0.12% should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled.

Information for Patients

Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the following information and instructions:

This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes.
This medication should not be used for any disorder other than that for which it was prescribed.
The treated scalp area should not be bandaged or otherwise covered or wrapped so as to be occlusive unless directed by the physician.
Patients should report to their physician any signs of local adverse reactions.
As with other corticosteroids, therapy should be discontinued when control is achieved. If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks, contact the physician.

Laboratory Tests

The following tests may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression:

ACTH stimulation test

A.M. plasma cortisol test

Urinary free cortisol test

Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Atopic dermatitis — topical corticosteroids after moisturization failure: In patients with uncontrolled atopic dermatitis refractory to moisturization alone, the JTF panel recommends addition of a topical corticosteroid over no topical corticosteroid (strong recommendation, high-certainty evidence). The linked systematic review and NMA synthesized 219 RCTs enrolling 43,123 infants, children, and adults with primarily mild-moderate AD addressing 68 different treatments, and TCS, used in RCTs mostly for 2 to 6 weeks, probably did not importantly increase adverse effects, including skin infections, atrophy, or other local skin changes. A Cochrane systematic review reported 26 cases of skin atrophy of 3574 RCT children and adult participants applying mild, moderate, and potent TCS for primarily either 1 to 6 weeks or 16 to 20 weeks (raw proportion: 7 per 1000 [95% CI, 5–11 per 1000]).

Topical corticosteroids — classification and selection in adult psoriasis — are classified into 7 categories based on skin vasoconstrictive activity, ranging in strength from ultra-high (class 1) to low (class 6 and 7), and choosing potency and vehicle should be based on disease severity, disease location, patient preference, and age. In adults, corticosteroids in classes 2 through 5 are generally recommended as initial therapy; lower potency corticosteroids should be used on the face, intertriginous areas, and areas that are susceptible to steroid atrophy (eg, forearms) and other adverse effects, while areas with thick, chronic plaques often require treatment with class 1 (ultrahigh-potency) corticosteroids.

### Gold as an oral corticosteroid sparing agent in stable asthma [^115ivkVb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with chronic severe asthma are often dependent on the long term prescription of oral corticosteroids. The use of steroids is associated with serious side effects. Physicians treating such patients continue to search for alternative therapies that reduce the need for chronic dosing with oral steroids. Gold compounds are immunosuppressive agents and have benefits in the treatment of a number of inflammatory disorders. They have therefore been identified as an potentially useful agents in the treatment of chronic severe asthma both in terms of possible efficacy and as steroid sparing agents.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of adding gold to oral steroids in the treatment of chronic steroid dependent asthmatics.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Airways Group trials register and reference lists of identified articles were searched.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials looking at the addition of gold compared to placebo in adult steroid dependent asthmatics.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trial quality was assessed and data extraction was carried out by two reviewers independently. Study authors were contacted for missing information.

Main Results

Three trials fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in the review and a total of 376 patients were recruited into these studies. Data from 311 patients could be analysed. There was a small but significant treatment effect for gold in terms of steroid dose reduction (Peto Odds Ratio 0.51, 95% confidence intervals 0.31,0.83). No meta-analysis could be done for measures of lung function although overall there were few changes suggesting a positive benefit for gold. There were trends suggestive of adverse effects but no significant changes for gold treated patients with respect to proteinuria (Peto Odds Ratio 1.4, 95% confidence intervals 0.6, 3.3) dermatitis/eczema Peto Odds Ratio 2.1, 95% confidence intervals 0.9, 4.7).

Reviewer's Conclusions

The changes seen in these trials are small and probably of limited clinical significance. Given the side effects of gold and necessity for monitoring the use of gold as a steroid sparing agent in asthma cannot be recommended.

### Joint American Academy of Dermatology-National Psoriasis Foundation guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis in pediatric patients [^114kyfdP]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric psoriasis — topical corticosteroids usage, efficacy, and precautions are as follows: It is advisable to avoid the use of ultra-high-potency topical corticosteroids in the face, fold, and genitalia of infants and children. Short-term (2 weeks) clobetasol foam had no limit on BSA of application; in patients younger than 12 years of age hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression was found but was reversible, whereas no HPA suppression was noted in patients ages 12 through 18 years. In 11 pediatric patients treated with halobetasol monotherapy for 14 days, ten of the 11 (90.9%) reported marked improvement and 8 (72%) complete clearance at study end; the study recommended limiting use to 1 week, switching to a moderate- or mild-potency steroid thereafter and avoiding use on the face, body folds, and genitalia. The adverse effect profile for topical corticosteroids in children is analogous to that in adults, particularly relating to burning and stinging at the application site. Younger patients ages 0 through 6 years are vulnerable to HPA suppression. High-potency or ultra-high-potency topical corticosteroids should be used with caution, and patients should be followed closely by a dermatologist to ensure proper use and to monitor for overuse and adverse effects. Careful instruction on the amount to apply and safe sites for use should be reiterated, and a limited quantity should be supplied. Providers and caregivers should be aware of the potential for rebound flare if high-potency corticosteroids are abruptly discontinued without transition to an appropriate alternative treatment.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^111Qr7Dc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Effectiveness: patient‐reported symptoms of eczema (secondary outcome)

One within‐participant trial measured patient‐reported effectiveness in a comparison of twice daily application of a very potent topical corticosteroid to once daily application of a second‐generation potent topical corticosteroid in 58 adults with moderate to severe eczema (Goh 1999). At day 8, the number of participants reporting an excellent response on the side treated with very potent topical corticosteroid was nine compared to three for the side treated with potent topical corticosteroid (OR 3.37, 95% 1.22 to 9.29; 1 trial, 58 participants). At day 22, 25 participants reported an excellent response on the side treated with very potent topical corticosteroid compared to six treated with potent topical corticosteroid (OR 6.57, 95% CI 3.14 to 13.74; 1 trial, 58 participants; Analysis 4.4). we judged the certainty of evidence to be very low.

Safety: number of relevant local adverse events (primary outcome)

Two trials looked for local adverse events (Goh 1999; Yawalkar 1991). Bleeker 1975 also reported local adverse events, however they did not present results for participants with atopic eczema separately for this outcome. Taken together, we judged the certainty of evidence to be very low.

Skin thinning and related signs

Two trials in adults with moderate and severe eczema that compared very potent and potent topical corticosteroids of two to three weeks' duration looked for the number of participants with skin thinning and related signs; none were reported (Goh 1999; Yawalkar 1991; 175 participants; Analysis 4.5).

Local site reactions

Yawalkar 1991 reported five local adverse events in the group that received very potent topical corticosteroid (58 participants) and two in the group that received potent topical corticosteroid (59 participants), which included dryness and itching. One participant per group discontinued because of severe dryness. Goh 1999 also stated that "no side effects were observed on any of the treated sites" (58 participants). See Analysis 4.6.

Other adverse events are described under 'Unspecified adverse events (safety)'.

### Role of topical calcineurin inhibitors in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis: a review of pathophysiology, safety, and efficacy [^111bGUaa]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is characterized by erythematous pruritic patches and plaques with greasy scale that occur in sebaceous areas. It is common, affecting up to 3% of the population. Past treatments have relied on a wide variety of anti-inflammatory and antifungal agents, but corticosteroids have limited use because of long-term adverse effects. Topical calcineurin inhibitors provide a safe alternative for the treatment of SD, as these drugs block the inflammatory cascade involved in the disease process and pose no risk of skin atrophy. Studies of topical pimecrolimus and tacrolimus in the treatment of SD have found that improvement occurred within 2 weeks, and if SD recurred after stopping treatment, it was significantly less severe. There have been no studies of the comparative efficacy of pimecrolimus versus tacrolimus for the treatment of SD. Common adverse effects of mild burning and irritation have been associated with the use of both of these agents. Safety profile studies are limited to studies of atopic dermatitis, which show no increase in infection rate, photocarcinogenicity, or signs of immunosuppression in patients using topical calcineurin inhibitors for long-term treatment. This article reviews the clinical trials of pimecrolimus and tacrolimus in the treatment of SD, focusing on efficacy and safety.

### Tacrolimus ointment for the treatment of adult and pediatric atopic dermatitis: review on safety and benefits [^111XYh5A]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Abstract

Atopic dermatitis requires long‐term management, mainly with topical anti‐inflammatory agents. Topical corticosteroids and tacrolimus ointment (‐O) are recommended as first‐line treatments for. However, the long‐term use ofis limited by cutaneous adverse events such as skin atrophy. For‐O, Japanese andlabelings were updated in 2003 and 2006, respectively, to include a boxed warning about a theoretical risk of skin cancer and lymphoma in patients treated with topical calcineurin inhibitors. However,‐O has been used worldwide for longer than 15 years to treat adult and pediatric patients with. Available data suggest that‐O is effective and well tolerated, and can improve quality of life.‐O has successfully been used in the proactive management ofconsisting of long‐term intermittent use to prevent, delay or reduce the occurrence offlares. Systemic drug absorption after‐O application is negligible and unlikely to result in systemic immunosuppression. There is currently no strong evidence of an increased rate of malignancy in treated patients, and observational data from postmarketing surveillance studies have shown no safety concerns. In the absence of robust evidence, the warning about the carcinogenic potential in the Japanese labeling for‐O does not appear justified and should be reconsidered. This mitigation of description would allow adult and pediatric patients withto receive the effective treatment more appropriately.

### Case report of novel combination of anthralin and calcipotriene leading to trichologic response in alopecia areata [^115WmKUD]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune, nonscarring alopecic disorder with a lifetime prevalence of about 2%. This disorder presents with varying amounts of hair loss, ranging from focal patchy loss to entire scalp and body hair loss as in alopecia totalis (AT) and alopecia universalis (AU), respectively. Severe subtypes are difficult to treat and contribute to significant patient burden. Current treatment strategies center on immunomodulation, both systemically and topically.

Systemic therapies such as oral corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and methotrexate can be efficacious, with regrowth rates between 30% and 76%. However, side-effect profiles, lengthy treatment durations, and relapse rates after discontinuation of therapy limit their use. Newer Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors appear promising, yet patients relapse after treatment cessation, and cost is often prohibitive.

Topical glucocorticoids offer variable efficacy; 17.8% of patients with AT or AU had long-term regrowth with clobetasol use. Topical calcineurin inhibitors have not demonstrated efficacy, perhaps because of insufficient depth of penetration. Intralesional triamcinolone at concentrations of 2.5 to 5 mg/mL are considered first-line therapy with regrowth seen in 61% of subjects with AT at 6 weeks and minimal side effects. An additional therapeutic option used for more severe forms of AA is the topical immunomodulator, diphenylcyclopropenone (DPCP). Although the exact mechanism of DPCP is unknown, its resultant allergic contact dermatitis is thought to cause antigenic competition and an alteration of the inflammatory cytokine milieu. In one retrospective study of 50 patients treated with DPCP, terminal hair regrowth of 50% or more was seen in 56% and 71% of those with AU and AT, respectively.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis in adults with topical therapies [^112DydqR]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Topical corticosteroids — adverse effects and monitoring: The incidence of adverse events with TCS is low, and although they are associated with cutaneous side effects (purpura, telangiectasia, hypopigmentation, focal hypertrichosis, acneiform eruptions, striae), skin atrophy is generally the most concerning. Risk factors for atrophy include higher potency TCS use, occlusion, use on thinner and intertriginous skin, older patient age, and long-term continuous use. Allergic contact dermatitis to TCS or excipients can be determined via patch testing. Two systematic reviews deemed the strength of evidence regarding Topical Steroid Addiction (TSA) and Topical Steroid Withdrawal (TSW) to be too low to very low, and the most consistent risk factor associated with TSA/TSW is prolonged, inappropriate use of potent topical steroids on the face or in intertriginous areas. Red face syndrome and red scrotum syndrome may occur after prolonged TCS use. Noncutaneous side effects with TCS are rare; an association with cataracts or glaucoma is unclear, but minimizing periorbital steroid use is advised. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression can occur with prolonged, continuous use of high potency TCS on large surface areas (especially with other corticosteroid forms) and can be assessed via a cortisol stimulation test; associations with type 2 diabetes and osteoporosis have been described but warrant further exploration.

### Betamethasone valerate (Luxiq) [^117PZtRU]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

General

Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has caused reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment. Manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can also be produced in some patients by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids while on treatment.

Conditions which augment systemic absorption include the application of the more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, prolonged use, and the addition of occlusive dressings.

Therefore, patients applying a topical steroid to a large surface area or to areas under occlusion should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression. If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid.

Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency may occur requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. For information on systemic supplementation, see prescribing information for those products.

Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios. (See PRECAUTIONS-Pediatric Use .)

If irritation develops, Luxíq should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Allergic contact dermatitis with corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing a failure to heal rather than noting a clinical exacerbation, as with most topical products not containing corticosteroids. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic patch testing.

In the presence of dermatological infections, the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of Luxíq should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled.

Information for Patients

Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the following information and instructions:

This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes.
This medication should not be used for any disorder other than that for which it was prescribed.
The treated scalp area should not be bandaged or otherwise covered or wrapped so as to be occlusive unless directed by the physician.
Patients should report to their physician any signs of local adverse reactions.
As with other corticosteroids, therapy should be discontinued when control is achieved. If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks, contact the physician.

### Tacrolimus ointment for the treatment of adult and pediatric atopic dermatitis: review on safety and benefits [^115zps5H]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) requires long-term management, mainly with topical anti-inflammatory agents. Topical corticosteroids (TCS) and tacrolimus ointment (TAC-O) are recommended as first-line treatments for AD. However, the long-term use of TCS is limited by cutaneous adverse events such as skin atrophy. For TAC-O, Japanese and US labelings were updated in 2003 and 2006, respectively, to include a boxed warning about a theoretical risk of skin cancer and lymphoma in patients treated with topical calcineurin inhibitors. However, TAC-O has been used worldwide for longer than 15 years to treat adult and pediatric patients with AD. Available data suggest that TAC-O is effective and well tolerated, and can improve quality of life. TAC-O has successfully been used in the proactive management of AD consisting of long-term intermittent use to prevent, delay or reduce the occurrence of AD flares. Systemic drug absorption after TAC-O application is negligible and unlikely to result in systemic immunosuppression. There is currently no strong evidence of an increased rate of malignancy in treated patients, and observational data from postmarketing surveillance studies have shown no safety concerns. In the absence of robust evidence, the warning about the carcinogenic potential in the Japanese labeling for TAC-O does not appear justified and should be reconsidered. This mitigation of description would allow adult and pediatric patients with AD to receive the effective treatment more appropriately.

Topical corticosteroid safety and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis effects — short-term high-potency use appears low risk: The daily use of ultrahigh- and high-potency (class 1–3) corticosteroids for up to 4 weeks is generally safe with minimal risk of skin atrophy, and in a systematic review of 13 randomized studies up to 4 weeks, reductions in morning cortisol were 0% with halobetasol or fluocinonide, 0% to 48% with clobetasol propionate, and 0% to 18% with betamethasone dipropionate; nevertheless, adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation tests were always within normal reference ranges even when assessed after 6 to 12 months of topical corticosteroid use.

### Systematic review of published trials: long-term safety of topical corticosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitors in pediatric patients with atopic dermatitis [^111kgynW]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Many clinicians have concerns about the safety of atopic dermatitis (AD) treatments, particularly in children requiring long-term daily maintenance therapy. Topical corticosteroids (TCS) have been widely used for > 5 decades. Long-term TCS monotherapy has been associated with adverse cutaneous effects including atrophy, rebound flares, and increased percutaneous absorption with potential for adverse systemic effects. Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs), tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, available for 1–2 decades, are not associated with atrophy or increased percutaneous absorption after prolonged use and have much lower potential for systemic effects. However, since 2006 TCIs have carried a controversial Boxed Warning based on a theoretical risk of malignancy (eg, skin and lymphoma) that has limited TCI use for standard-of-care maintenance therapy.

Methods

A comparative systematic search of PubMed was done for long-term (≥ 12 week) clinical trials of TCS or TCI treatment in patients < 12 years with AD. Citations were reviewed for inclusion based on MeSH terms, abstracts, and relevant article text. Studies were excluded if they did not encompass subjects < 12 years, or were < 12 weeks' duration, retrospective, meta-analyses, or limited to anecdotal case reports.

Results

Of 27 trials meeting criteria, 21 included 5825 pediatric patients treated with TCIs, and 6 included 1999 patients treated with TCS. TCS studies were limited to low- to mid-potency products, and all but one study lacked a vehicle control. Eight TCI studies were vehicle-controlled, and safety data were well reported, with ≤ 5% of patients reporting discontinuation due to adverse effects (DAEs). Cutaneous and systemic adverse events (AEs) were similar in TCI and vehicle groups, with no reports of lymphoma. Safety data in TCS trials were less well reported. DAE incidence was addressed in just 2 trials, and systemic and cutaneous AEs were mostly unreported.

Conclusions

Data supporting long-term use of TCIs are robust, documenting safety and efficacy, while data supporting long-term TCS use are limited to low- to mid-potency products. Our review identifies a lack of information on the safety of commonly prescribed, long-term monotherapy with mid- to high-potency TCS in pediatric AD, and supports standard-of-care maintenance therapy with TCIs and intermittent use of low- to mid-potency TCS for flares.

### Successful treatment of corticosteroid-resistant ophiasis-type alopecia areata (AA) with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) [^112EbMbQ]. JAAD Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Side effects from steroid injections are generally transient in nature and include local cutaneous effects such as atrophy, telangiectasia, and pigmentation changes. Systemic effects appear to be uncommon with steroid injections but studies addressing the frequency of these issues in patients with AA receiving scalp injections are lacking. In other fields of medicine, it is clear that even a single dose of steroid in the nonoral route can lead to mood changes. For example, Fishman et alpublished a report of corticosteroid-induced mania after a single regional application at the celiac plexus.

When administered via the oral route, mood changes are not uncommon. Naber et alreported that 26% of patients who were initially free of psychiatric illness and received short courses of high-dose prednisone for ophthalmologic disorders developed mania and 10% developed depression. The Boston Collaborative Drug Surveillance Programfound that severe psychiatric illness occurred with a frequency of 1.3%. Mood-related side effects from oral steroids appear to be dose dependent. Given the high prevalence of mood disorders such as major depressive disorderand anxietyin patients with AA, further study is needed to evaluate the benefits of PRP for those who experience mood changes with steroid injections.

Currently, it appears that administration of PRP is not associated with many of the side effects of corticosteroids (Table I). Indeed, PRP administration to 45 patients with AA was also not associated with side effects. The patient presented here did not experience side effects other than transient discomfort. Importantly, she did not experience any of the mood changes she had previously experienced with steroid injections. Further study is needed to understand the short- and long-term efficacy of PRP and in the treatment of AA.

Vitamin D analogue topical therapy — long-term use of topical vitamin D analogues is recommended for mild to moderate psoriasis, with specified course lengths and combination strategies. The long-term use of topical vitamin D analogues (up to 52 weeks) is recommended for treatment of mild to moderate psoriasis. For scalp disease, calcipotriene foam and calcipotriene plus betamethasone dipropionate gel are recommended for 4–12 weeks. For facial psoriasis, topical calcitriol ointment or calcipotriene combined with hydrocortisone for 8 weeks can be used. Combination treatments with vitamin D analogues and potent class II and class III topical corticosteroids up to 52 weeks are recommended, and combination products with calcipotriene and corticosteroids are recommended. For maintenance, vitamin D analogues twice daily on weekdays with high-potency topical corticosteroids twice daily on weekends can be considered, and a regimen of morning high-potency topical corticosteroids with evening topical vitamin D analogues can be considered.

### Efficacy of roflumilast foam, 0.3%, in patients with seborrheic dermatitis: a double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 2a randomized clinical trial [^113pznTx]. JAMA Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that affects patients of all ages, with a global prevalence of 5% or greater. Cardinal features are erythematous, scaly, pruritic patches and plaques, with a yellowish, greasy appearance, affecting areas with abundant sebaceous glands, often accompanied by dyspigmentation in patients with darker skin. Seborrheic dermatitis can have deleterious effects on quality of life, particularly in patients with more severe disease.

Treatment options for seborrheic dermatitis include topical antifungals, corticosteroids, and sulfur/sulfacetamide; topical calcineurin inhibitors are also used off label. Coal tar is less commonly used and is associated with safety concerns. Treatments are available as creams, lotions, ointments, foams, shampoos, gels, and solutions/topical suspensions. Corticosteroids are effective, but should not be used long term due to risk of atrophy, telangiectasia, acne, rosacea, and ocular toxic effects when used on the eyelid. Topical calcineurin inhibitors are not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat seborrheic dermatitis; however, efficacy and safety have been assessed in patients with severe facial seborrheic dermatitis. Topical calcineurin inhibitors are associated with short-term warmth and burning sensations, and labeling includes a warning for rare cases of lymphoma and skin cancer, although clinical data do not suggest higher risk compared with the general population. Scalp seborrheic dermatitis is often treated with shampoos containing antifungal agents, selenium sulfide, or zinc pyrithione. Nonpharmacologic treatments, such as prescription nonsteroidal medical device creams, may also be useful to treat erythema, scaling, and itching associated with seborrheic dermatitis.

### Intermittent low-dose corticosteroid therapy for hidradenitis suppurativa: a case series [^116WdBXv]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is an inflammatory disorder that affects the pilosebaceous unit of intertriginous zones. Therapeutic interventions depend on the severity of the disease; however, for patients presenting with Hurley stage III, systemic immunosuppressive treatments are often indicated. Short-term use of systemic corticosteroids can provide help in managing acute exacerbation in recalcitrant cases; however, withdrawal flares and side effects usually prevent their long-term use. Administering corticosteroids through intermittent pulse dosing has proven effective in avoiding usual side effects as well as in exerting long-term remission in other inflammatory conditions. Recent management guidelines reference intermittent therapy as a potential rescue therapy for acute HS flares; however no data currently exist on intermittent dosing of corticosteroids for HS.

Herein, we present 3 cases of recalcitrant HS treated with oral intermittent low-dose betamethasone therapy (Table I).

### Joint AAD-NPF guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with topical therapy and alternative medicine modalities for psoriasis severity measures [^113dATUJ]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

Topical corticosteroids — tapering, maintenance strategies, pregnancy/lactation precautions, and tachyphylaxis are detailed as follows: Topical corticosteroids can be tapered off by reducing use to every other day, then eventually 2 times a week, and finally discontinuation if psoriasis is well controlled and stable during the whole process, and to minimize adverse effects, transitioning to lower-potency agents after improvement, using intermittent therapy, and combining treatment with noncorticosteroidal agents can also be considered. Topical corticosteroids are safe during pregnancy when low cumulative doses (< 60 g/wk) are used (expert consensus), though in rare cases, low fetal birth weight has been reported with prolonged potent topical corticosteroid use during pregnancy, and the use of a super potent corticosteroid in the nipple and the areola area should be avoided in nursing mothers. Because psoriasis generally recurs after discontinuation of topical corticosteroid treatment, steroid-sparing agents may be used to supplement and reduce over-reliance on topical corticosteroids as monotherapy, and an example regimen for mild psoriasis flares could include 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with a topical corticosteroid twice daily followed by maintenance with a steroid-sparing agent twice daily on weekdays and a corticosteroid agent twice daily on weekends; proactive treatment typically involves twice-weekly treatment of clinically quiescent areas to reduce the frequency of flares. Tachyphylaxis is defined as the loss of effectiveness of topical corticosteroids with continued use and may compromise effectiveness in certain patients when used for an extended period > 12 weeks.

The use of Taclonex Topical Suspension for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials in adults and from three uncontrolled trials in pediatric subjects that enrolled 109 adolescents with moderate psoriasis of the scalp and 107 adolescents with psoriasis of the scalp and body. After 4 weeks of once daily treatment with Taclonex Topical Suspension, HPA axis suppression was observed in 3% of adolescents with psoriasis of the scalp and 16% of adolescents with psoriasis of the scalp and body. Calcium metabolism was evaluated in 107 adolescents with psoriasis of the scalp and body treated with Taclonex Topical Suspension and no cases of hypercalcemia or clinically relevant changes in urinary calcium were reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, pediatric patients are at a greater risk than adults of systemic toxicity when treated with topical corticosteroids. Pediatric patients are, therefore, also at greater risk of HPA axis suppression and adrenal insufficiency with the use of topical corticosteroids including Taclonex®Topical Suspension [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Rare systemic toxicities such as Cushing's syndrome, linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in pediatric patients, especially those with prolonged exposure to large doses of high potency topical corticosteroids. Local adverse reactions including striae have also been reported with use of topical corticosteroids in pediatric patients.

The safety and effectiveness of Taclonex Topical Suspension in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age have not been established.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of Taclonex Topical Suspension in plaque psoriasis on non-scalp areas included 124 subjects who were 65 years of age or older, and 36 were 75 years of age or older. Clinical studies of Taclonex Topical Suspension in subjects with psoriasis of the scalp included 334 subjects who were 65 years or older and 84 subjects who were 75 years or older.

No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of Taclonex Topical Suspension were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified any differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

### Molluscum contagiosum infection associated with pimecrolimus use in pityriasis alba [^115NqMAo]. Pediatric Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is an inflammatory, chronically relapsing, highly pruritic skin disorder that has considerable impact on the quality of life. As corticosteroids are not ideal for long-term control of the disease because of their potential side effects, steroid-free topical immunomodulators have recently been developed for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. Although clinical trials do not indicate an increased risk of cutaneous infection, the clinician must be careful about viral infections such as eczema herpeticum or molluscum eczema that can be observed during treatment with pimecrolimus and tacrolimus. We report molluscum contagiosum that developed on the preauricular area treated with topical pimecrolimus.

### Guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. section 3. guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with topical therapies [^116nBgUc]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Topical corticosteroids for plaque-type psoriasis (Table III) can be used as monotherapy 1–2 times daily and can be combined with other topical agents, UV light, and systemic agents; the Stoughton-Cornell classification system divides steroids into 7 classes. For duration, Class I steroids: available data for 2–4 weeks of treatment, and gradual reduction in usage recommended following clinical response; while optimal end point is unknown, unsupervised continuous use is not recommended; for clobetasol and halobetasol, maximal weekly use should be 50 g or less. Short-term results note that highly potent agents have greater efficacy than less potent agents, whereas true efficacy and risks associated with long-term use are unknown as most clinical trials are of short duration; tachyphylaxis, while not demonstrated in clinical trials, may affect the long-term results achieved in a given patient, and combination with other topicals and variations in dosing schedules may lessen risk of long-term side effects. Systemic risks include that hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression may occur with use of medium- and high-potency topical steroids and increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and cataracts have been reported with use around the eye; risks increase when used with excessive frequency or duration and it is unknown if there is an increased risk of infection with long-term use. Baseline monitoring: None, with ongoing monitoring including assessment of growth in children using topical corticosteroids for long term and regular skin checks for all patients receiving long-term therapy to assess for atrophy; special populations guidance includes Pregnancy: Category C, Nursing: Unknown safety, and Pediatric use cautions that risks to infants and children may be higher for systemic effects secondary to enhanced absorption and that growth retardation is also a potential concern.

### Ocular Co-morbidities of atopic dermatitis. part II: ocular disease secondary to treatments [^115AQKFQ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Treatments used for managing atopic dermatitis (AD) may have adverse ocular effects that permanently affect vision. The objective of this review is to raise awareness among dermatologists regarding the potential ocular adverse effects of various AD therapies, including corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, an interleukin-4 receptor α (IL-4Rα) antagonist, and phototherapy. Pertinent potential short- and long-term risks of these therapies include elevations in intraocular pressure from use of topical corticosteroids and conjunctivitis from use of dupilumab. Since some of these adverse effects may not exhibit symptomatology until permanent vision impairment occurs, it is important for dermatologists to understand these risks and proactively ensure their patients are receiving appropriate measures to prevent them.

### Adverse effects of topical glucocorticosteroids [^1125o9iu]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Topical corticosteroids were introduced into medicine about 50 years ago. They represent a significant milestone in dermatologic therapy. Despite encouragement to report observed adverse drug reactions, the clinical practice of reporting is poor and incomplete. Likewise, adverse effects and safety of topical corticosteroids are neglected in the medical literature. The authors provide an updated review of their adverse-effect profile. Children are more prone to the development of systemic reactions to topically applied medication because of their higher ratio of total body surface area to body weight. Cutaneous adverse effects occur regularly with prolonged treatment and are dependent on the chemical nature of the drug, the vehicle, and the location of its application. The most frequent adverse effects include atrophy, striae, rosacea, perioral dermatitis, acne, and purpura. Those that occur with lower frequency include hypertrichosis, pigmentation alterations, delayed wound healing, and exacerbation of skin infections. Of particular interest is the rate of contact sensitization against corticosteroids, which is considerably higher than generally believed. Systemic reactions such as hyperglycemia, glaucoma, and adrenal insufficiency have also been reported to follow topical application. The authors provide an updated review of local and systemic adverse effects upon administration of topical corticosteroids, including the latest FDA report on the safety of such steroids in children.

Learning Objective

At the completion of this learning activity, participants should be familiar with topical corticosteroids and their proper use.

### Long-term use of oral corticosteroids and safety outcomes for patients with atopic dermatitis [^114JKfqK]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

The use of oral corticosteroids for prolonged periods may be associated with adverse events (AEs). Nevertheless, the risk of AEs with oral corticosteroids, especially among patients with atopic dermatitis (AD), has not been comprehensively investigated and lacks evidence on duration of treatment.

Objective

To assess the association between long-term exposure to oral corticosteroids and AEs among adult patients with AD.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This nested case-control study used data from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service database of South Korea between January 1, 2012, and October 31, 2021, which included 1 year prior to the cohort entry date of January 1, 2013, for assessing exclusion criteria and baseline characteristics, and 1 year after the study end date of October 31, 2020, to ensure a minimum duration for assessing exposure. Among the population of adults with AD, patients diagnosed with any of 11 AEs were matched with patients who had never received a diagnosis of any of the 11 AEs.

Exposure

Long-term use of oral corticosteroids was defined as cumulative supply of more than 30 days or more than 90 days of oral corticosteroid prescription per year.

Main Outcomes and Measures

We used multivariable conditional logistic regression analyses to measure the risk of 11 individual outcomes (osteoporosis, fracture, type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, avascular necrosis, cataract, or glaucoma) as the composite outcome, controlling for potential confounders. We further classified the composite outcome to individual outcomes to evaluate the AE-specific risk.

Results

Among 1 025 270 patients with AD between 2013 and 2020, 164 809 cases (mean [SD] age, 39.4 [14.8]; 56.9% women) were matched with 328 303 controls (mean [SD] age, 39.3 [14.7]; 56.9% women) for sex, age, cohort entry date, follow-up duration, and severity of AD, where the balance of most baseline characteristics was achieved. A total of 5533 cases (3.4%) and 10 561 controls (3.2%) were exposed to oral corticosteroids for more than 30 days, while 684 cases (0.4%) and 1153 controls (0.4%) were exposed to oral corticosteroids for more than 90 days. Overall, there was no increased risk of AEs with use of oral corticosteroids for more than 30 days (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.00; 95% CI, 0.97–1.04), whereas the risk was slightly higher with use of oral corticosteroids for more than 90 days (AOR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.01–1.23). The small elevation in experiencing an AE was observed with each cumulative or consecutive year of ever long-term use.

Conclusions and Relevance

This case-control study found a slightly increased risk of AEs associated with use of oral corticosteroids for more than 90 days per year, which warrants future research to fully elucidate the observed findings.

### Systemic therapy of childhood atopic dermatitis [^111bH4n2]. Clinics in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common childhood inflammatory disease that, in a small percentage of cases, can become severe enough to require potent systemic treatment. Many trials have been conducted with systemic agents for the treatment of severe pediatric AD; we review the evidence here. Although corticosteroids are widely used in practice, they are not generally recommended as a systemic treatment option for AD in children. Most patients experience a relatively rapid and robust response to cyclosporine. Treating children with cyclosporine long term is troubling; however, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, and methotrexate are all reasonable alternatives for maintenance therapy in recalcitrant cases. Several additional options are available for the most refractory cases, including interferon-γ, intravenous immunoglobulin, and various biologics. Phototherapy is another modality that can be effective in treating severe AD. Ultimately the choice of agent is individualized. Systemic therapy options are associated with potentially severe adverse effects and require careful monitoring. Nonsystemic approaches toward prevention of flares and long-term control of atopic dermatitis in pediatric patients should be continued in conjunction with systemic therapy. In the future, more targeted systemic treatments hold the potential for effective control of disease with fewer side effects than broadly immunosuppressive agents.

### Use and abuse of topical corticosteroids in infections of the skin and related structures [^112Qihr2]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids have improved the management of many inflammatory skin diseases, such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. However, these medications are associated with certain adverse effects that are potentially serious. The potent anti-inflammatory actions of these drugs increase susceptibility to bacterial and fungal infections, and therefore may preclude them from use when infection is the known cause of the disease. In addition, children may be more vulnerable than adults to systemic effects of topical corticosteroids because percutaneous absorption is proportionately greater. These are important considerations, and physicians need to weigh and compare the risks and benefits associated with these medications before initiating treatment. This involves an appreciation of which patient populations are at high risk, which skin conditions are incompatible with topical corticosteroid therapy, and which alternative nonsteroidal medications are effective in treating inflammatory skin diseases.

### Corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis: an update for dermatologists [^113TgWDv]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Long-term corticosteroid treatment is the most common secondary cause of bone loss. Patients treated with long-term corticosteroid therapy may develop osteopenia or osteoporosis, and many have fractures. It is difficult to predict which corticosteroid-treated patients will develop significant skeletal complications because of variability in the underlying diseases treated with corticosteroids, and because of variation in corticosteroid dose over time. Corticosteroid therapy causes an alteration in the ratio between osteoprotegerin (OPG) and receptor activator of nuclear factor κ B (RANK) ligand (RANKL), which leads to early increased bone resorption for the first 3–6 months, with long-term treatment leading primarily to suppression of bone formation. Recently published recommendations advise the use of bisphosphonates or teriparatide in high-risk patients, depending on fracture risk assessed by bone mineral density testing. This article gives an update of current knowledge regarding the pathophysiology, clinical presentation and evaluation, and prevention and treatment of patients with corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis.

### The evolving role of therapeutic shampoos for targeting symptoms of inflammatory scalp disorders [^114Y5j4o]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Scalp lesions are common among patients with psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis and a number of other inflammatory and fungal conditions. Topical corticosteroids are a mainstay of treatment for many scalp dermatoses and they significantly reduce erythema, scaling and pruritus. Conventional corticosteroid formulations such as cream and ointments are often difficult or time consuming for patients to apply and may produce undesirable cosmetic effects. Medicated shampoos provide a more convenient alternative for patients who require topical administration of corticosteroids for scalp conditions. Tar shampoos have long been used to treat psoriasis and are effective for the long-term maintenance of remission in patients who respond to therapy. Antifungal shampoos are effective for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis and other mycotic conditions. A shampoo formulation containing fluocinolone acetonide, 0.01% is also approved for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. One superpotent corticosteroid shampoo (clobetasol propionate 0.05%; Clobex Shampoo) is approved in the United States (U.S.) for once-daily treatment of psoriasis of the scalp. The results of a 2007 pilot study also demonstrated that clobetasol propionate shampoo improved the signs and symptoms of seborrheic dermatitis. These findings suggest that high-potency corticosteroid shampoos may provide an important option for topical corticosteroid therapy in dermatologic conditions affecting the scalp.

### American Academy of Dermatology guidelines: awareness of comorbidities associated with atopic dermatitis in adults [^112zUKxb]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) in adults — bone health risks include osteoporosis and fractures: a Taiwanese study found AD associated with an increased risk of developing osteoporosis (HR, 4.72; 95% CI, 3.68–6.05); a UK cohort reported fracture risk modestly elevated overall (HR, 1.07; 99% CI, 1.05–1.09) and somewhat higher for more severe AD (HR, 1.22; 99% CI, 1.14–1.30); among those with osteoporosis, severe AD was associated with 20%, 66%, and 50% increased rates of spinal, pelvic, and hip fractures, respectively. Potential contributors noted include that on average, patients with AD are more likely to be deficient in vitamin D and that sleep disturbance may increase traumatic injury risk. Therapy-related considerations include that oral corticosteroids are a risk factor for fractures and are commonly used to treat severe AD flares; whether topical corticosteroids increase fracture risk is unclear, though a Denmark study found increased fracture risk with high cumulative use of potent topical corticosteroids. Patients prescribed oral corticosteroids for AD may be candidates for fracture prevention therapy if they meet thresholds such as oral corticosteroid use with a cumulative dose equivalent to ≥ 3 months of ≥ 5.7–7.5 mg daily of prednisone.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis: section 4. prevention of disease flares and use of adjunctive therapies and approaches [^113DDob9]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis proactive flare prevention — scheduled antiinflammatory therapy: Some individuals benefit from a proactive method whereby topical corticosteroids (TCS) or topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) are applied on a scheduled, intermittent basis to both previously and newly involved skin with moisturizers used on all areas; five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) used up to 4 weeks of acute disease control followed by twice weekly midpotency TCS (fluticasone propionate or methylprednisolone aceponate) for 16 to 20 weeks and showed reduced risk of flares, with a metaanalysis reporting pooled relative risk of flares of 0.46 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.38–0.55] vs vehicle. Two to 3 times weekly topical tacrolimus (0.03% in children, 0.1% in adults) to previously affected sites over 40 to 52 weeks (3 RCTs) yielded pooled relative risk of flares of 0.78 [95% CI, 0.60–1.00] and decreased number of flares with more days free of topical antiinflammatory use compared to vehicle. Overall, the proactive application of TCS or TCIs appears to be an effective strategy for AD flare prevention; a metaanalysis of vehicle-controlled trials suggested that topical fluticasone is superior to tacrolimus in preventing relapses, and skin atrophy was not noted with scheduled, intermittent TCS use.

### Treatment satisfaction, efficacy, and safety of delgocitinib ointment following switch from topical corticosteroids for trunk and extremity rash in atopic dermatitis [^111fTtTL]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by recurrent remissions and relapses. Topical anti-inflammatory steroids are commonly used for treatment, but their long-term use poses concerns because of potential side effects. Delgocitinib ointment, a Janus kinase inhibitor, has demonstrated efficacy in several clinical studies and is expected to be a viable alternative to topical corticosteroids (TCS). To evaluate the real-world safety and efficacy of delgocitinib in Japanese patients, we assessed the benefits of switching from TCS to delgocitinib ointment in AD patients with rashes on the trunk and extremities. Overall, data from 93 patients (mean age: 35years) were analyzed. Patients switched from TCS to delgocitinib ointment and were followed for up to 12weeks. Treatment outcomes were assessed using the treatment Satisfaction questionnaire for medication-9 (TSQM-9), Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), modified EASI (mEASI), Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) for itching, Atopic Dermatitis Control Tool (ADCT), and Patient Preference Questionnaire (PPQ). During the observation period, TSQM-9 scores were significantly improved (effectiveness 68.3 to 72.9, p < 0.05; global satisfaction 61.7 to 67.9, p < 0.01). Additionally, mEASI (8.82 to 6.92, p < 0.05), EASI (9.60 to 7.43, p < 0.001), NRS (5.6 to 4.5, p < 0.001), and ADCT (8.8 to 5.5, p < 0.001) scores were decreased during treatment. Moreover, local side effects were improved, with a > 20% reduction in the severity of skin atrophy and telangiectasia. Approximately 72% of patients reported that "the study drug is more effective" using the PPQ. Taken together, our study demonstrates that delgocitinib ointment is an effective treatment option for AD patients with rashes of the trunk and extremities, as well as for those concerned about the potential side effects of TCS. Trial Registration: The study was registered at the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (jRCTs031230102).

### Efficacy and tolerability of topical pimecrolimus and tacrolimus in the treatment of atopic dermatitis: meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114VNzNq]. BMJ (2005). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of topical pimecrolimus and tacrolimus compared with other treatments for atopic dermatitis.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Electronic searches of the Cochrane Library, Medline, and Embase.

Study Selection

Randomised controlled trials of topical pimecrolimus or tacrolimus reporting efficacy outcomes or tolerability.

Efficacy

investigators' global assessment of response; patients' global assessment of response; proportions of patients with flares of atopic dermatitis; and improvements in quality of life. Tolerability: overall rates of withdrawal; withdrawal due to adverse events; and proportions of patients with burning of the skin and skin infections.

Data Synthesis

4186 of 6897 participants in 25 randomised controlled trials received pimecrolimus or tacrolimus. Both drugs were significantly more effective than a vehicle control. Tacrolimus 0.1% was as effective as potent topical corticosteroids at three weeks and more effective than combined treatment with hydrocortisone butyrate 0.1% (potent used on trunk) plus hydrocortisone acetate 1% (weak used on face) at 12 weeks (number needed to treat (NNT) = 6). Tacrolimus 0.1% was also more effective than hydrocortisone acetate 1% (NNT = 4). In comparison, tacrolimus 0.03% was more effective than hydrocortisone acetate 1% (NNT = 5) but less effective than hydrocortisone butyrate 0.1% (NNT = -8). Direct comparisons of tacrolimus 0.03% and tacrolimus 0.1% consistently favoured the higher strength formulation, but efficacy differed significantly between the two strengths only after 12 weeks' treatment (rate ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.65 to 0.99). Pimecrolimus was far less effective than betamethasone valerate 0.1% (NNT = -3 at three weeks). Pimecrolimus and tacrolimus caused significantly more skin burning than topical corticosteroids. Rates of skin infections in any of the comparisons did not differ.

Conclusions

Both topical pimecrolimus and topical tacrolimus are more effective than placebo treatments for atopic dermatitis, but in the absence of studies that show long term safety gains, any advantage over topical corticosteroids is unclear. Topical tacrolimus is similar to potent topical corticosteroids and may have a place for long term use in patients with resistant atopic dermatitis on sites where side effects from topical corticosteroids might develop quickly. In the absence of key comparisons with mild corticosteroids, the clinical need for topical pimecrolimus is unclear. The usefulness of either treatment in patients who have failed to respond adequately to topical corticosteroids is also unclear.

### An open-label, single-center pilot study to determine the antifungal activity of a new nonsteroidal cream (promiseb topical cream) after 7 days of use in healthy volunteers [^1114LFkS]. Clinics in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids are effective for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. The duration of treatment with mid- to high-potency formulations is limited by the well-known side effects associated with their long-term use; further, topical corticosteroids treat only the inflammation associated with the disease. This study assessed the antifungal activity of a new corticosteroid-free cream against Malassezia spp, which may be an important pathogenic factor in seborrheic dermatitis. This was a single-center, bilateral, open-label pilot study in 10 healthy volunteers. The nonsteroidal cream was applied twice daily to a designated target area on the chest for 7 days, and the number of colony-forming units of Malassezia spp taken by tape stripping after 7 days was compared with baseline. The percentage reduction from baseline to day 7 in the number of colony-forming units of Malassezia spp was 94% on the treated side versus 49% on the untreated side (P = 0.03). This pilot study shows the nonsteroidal topical cream has antifungal activities. Further exploration into its potential as a therapeutic alternative for seborrheic dermatitis is warranted.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^116nvdrA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Authors' conclusions

Implications for practice

Ketoconazole was more effective than placebo at four weeks of follow-up and possibly at three months of follow-up, but few longer-term studies have been conducted. Evidence for this was of low quality. Evidence was insufficient to suggest a dose effect. The most often applied dose was 2%, but the frequency of application of treatments varied between studies from once or twice daily to once or three times weekly for varying lengths of time, and it is unclear which regimen works best.

Ketoconazole did not cause more side effects than were observed with placebo. Topical ketoconazole showed similar efficacy when compared with steroids, but steroids showed a two-fold greater risk of side effects than was seen with ketoconazole. Compared with other antifungals, we cannot say that ketoconazole consistently resulted in a more or less effective outcome because most of these comparisons involved single studies.

Ciclopirox was more effective than placebo but with a comparable incidence of side effects. Evidence was insufficient to reveal an effect of increased dose. Evidence was of moderate quality. Ciclopirox showed effects similar to those of ketoconazole. No comparisons of ciclopirox versus steroids were reported.

Bifonazaole was also found to be more effective than placebo.

Outome variables in this review were stratified according to site (scalp, face or scalp and face). Treatment outcomes were fairly consistent for ketoconazole and other antifungals across different application sites. Studies provided insufficient evidence that the mode of delivery accounted for consistent differences in treatment effect.

### Cushing's syndrome: hidden risk in usage of topical corticosteroids [^116c4oGz]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome in children may occur as a result of the application of exogenous steroids. Prolonged use of powerful corticosteroids suppresses adrenal functions and iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome may develop particularly in infants who are given topical corticosteroids. We report here a case on three infants having Cushing's syndrome with similar clinical presentations due to overuse of topical steroids for diaper dermatitis. The importance of exercising caution during the use of topical steroids is underlined in this study.

### Cushing's syndrome induced by misuse of moderate-to high-potency topical corticosteroids [^111SorqW]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of Cushing's syndrome caused by continuous use of moderate- to high-potency topical corticosteroids over several months.

Case Summary

An 11-month-old patient with atopic dermatitis received uninterrupted treatment with moderate- to high-potency topical corticosteroids. He presented with several food allergies and was admitted to the hospital after atopic dermatitis worsened. Signs of growth retardation, which had begun at 6 months of age, were also noted during the child's hospital stay. An endocrinologist concluded that a lower-than-normal bone density scan and growth retardation on both weight and growth curves were due to suppression of the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and a multifactorial failure to thrive.

Discussion

This is a case of an infant overexposed to topical corticosteroid treatment who developed Cushing's syndrome within a few months. Local treatment of atopic dermatitis is classically based on the use of topical corticosteroids in combination with an emollient or other drugs. To limit local and general damaging effects, the choice of topical corticosteroid must be made in terms of patient age, severity and site of the rash, and the extent of skin involvement. Several factors influence the systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. While our literature review indicated the possibility of a multifactorial origin of the child's growth retardation, the use of topical corticosteroids was shown to have contributed to suppression of the HPA axis. Application of the Naranjo probability scale indicated a probable relationship between the continuous and sustained administration of topical corticosteroids over several months and suppression of the HPA axis. Although topical corticosteroids are widely used and can be perceived by parents and patients to be safe, daily documentation of agents used and body surfaces exposed should be done during long-term treatment.

Conclusions

Continuous use of moderate- to high-potency topical corticosteroids over several months can contribute to Cushing's syndrome. Growth and development as well as cortisol levels should be monitored in children on long-term topical corticosteroid treatment.

### What's new in topicals for atopic dermatitis? [^1157whVL]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common inflammatory skin disease, affecting an estimated 16.5 million adults and 9.6 million children in the United States (US). This chronic condition often begins in the first few years of life and may persist into adulthood; however, adolescent and adult-onset disease are increasingly recognized. The pathogenesis of AD is complex but involves a dysregulated immune system and a compromised skin barrier. Mainstay therapy for acute management includes topical corticosteroids (TCSs) or non-steroidal alternatives including topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) and phosphodiesterase inhibitors, such as crisaborole ointment.

Since the 1950s, TCSs have remained the standard of care due to their ability to reduce skin inflammation and pruritus. However, long-term use may cause localized skin atrophy, telangiectasia, striae, perioral dermatitis, and acne. With extensive use, there is also the rare risk of systemic absorption, which may lead to suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, adversely affecting the linear growth and bone density of children and adults, respectively. As a result, patients and caregivers often underutilize TCSs due to fear of side effects, termed "steroid phobia".

TCIs have been approved (tacrolimus and pimecrolimus in 2000 and 2001, respectively) for short-term or intermittent use in patients who have previously failed on, or have contraindications to, TCSs. These second-line agents act as immunosuppressants and inhibit T cell activation, decreasing expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Tacrolimus 0.03% and 0.1% ointments are approved for adults and 0.03% for children aged 2–15 years with moderate-to-severe AD. Pimecrolimus 1% cream is indicated for non-immunocompromised adults and children aged ≥ 2 years with mild-to-moderate AD. Although these TCIs do not carry the risk of skin atrophy, they can cause local adverse effects of skin burning and irritation. In addition, a black box warning was added by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2006 regarding the hypothetical risk that TCIs may increase long-term cancer risk in individuals with AD; however, findings from multiple studies have not shown increased risks with their use.

### Psoriasis of the scalp. diagnosis and management [^111BRKvp]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Psoriasis of the scalp is a frequently occurring condition affecting approximately 2% of the Western population. The sharply demarcated erythematosquamous lesions with silver-white scaling characterize scalp psoriasis. Quality of life can be seriously reduced by this condition and therefore long term treatment is needed in most patients. Coal tar shampoos, containing 2 to 10% coal tar solution, are effective in scalp psoriasis. However, no double-blind studies are available to support such an assumption. Salicylic acid 5 to 10% has a pronounced keratolytic effect. Salicylic acid should be formulated in an ointment, which can be washed off easily. Crude coal tar is the most effective tar available for the treatment of psoriasis. An important feature of coal tar is its potent efficacy against pruritus. At the scalp, the application of crude coal tar is difficult. Therefore coal tar solution is the most frequently applied tar preparation in scalp psoriasis. Dithranol 0.1 to 3% is manufactured in various formulations. Treatment is initiated at a low concentration and the concentration is increased stepwise until a slight irritation, the feeling of warmth, is reached. In the treatment of scalp psoriasis, cream formulations are used. Imidazole antifungals have been used with success in scalp psoriasis. Overgrowth of the scalp with pityrosporon is a well-known feature of scalp psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis. In case of resistance to other topical treatments use of a topical or systemic imidazole derivative might be helpful. So far, topical corticosteroids are the most frequently used treatments for psoriasis of the scalp. Corticosteroids inhibit epidermal proliferation, inhibit inflammation and modulate immune functions. Topical corticosteroids are fast acting: within 3 to 4 weeks maximal efficacy is reached. No data are available to support the efficacy and safety of topical corticosteroids during long term use. However, from epidemiologic surveys we know that these treatments are used by the majority of patients for more than 8 weeks. Since 1992 vitamin D3 formulations have been developed for the treatment of psoriasis. Calcipotriol is available in most countries. Tacalcitol is available in Japan and several other countries. Vitamin D3 analogues inhibit epidermal proliferation, enhance cornification and inhibit inflammation. Therefore, vitamin D3 analogues have a substantial antipsoriatic effect. Systemic treatments such as methotrexate, cyclosporine and acitretin are indicated in patients with recalcitrant disease. Management of scalp psoriasis requires long term strategies in order to reach an optimal improvement of the condition, while avoiding the adverse effects associated with the long term use of treatments.

### Topical corticosteroids: choice and application [^116Wp8v2]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Topical corticosteroids are an essential tool for treating inflammatory skin conditions such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Topical corticosteroids are classified by strength and the risk of adverse effects such as atrophy, striae, rosacea, telangiectasias, purpura, and other cutaneous and systemic reactions. The risk of adverse effects increases with prolonged use, a large area of application, higher potency, occlusion, and application to areas of thinner skin such as the face and genitals. When prescribing topical corticosteroids for use in children, lower potencies and shorter durations should be used. Topical corticosteroids can work safely and effectively in patients who are pregnant or lactating. They are available in formulations such as ointments, creams, lotions, gels, foams, oils, solutions, and shampoos. The quantity of corticosteroid prescribed depends on the duration of treatment, the frequency of application, the skin location, and the total surface area treated. Correct patient application is critical to successful use. Patients may be taught application using the fingertip unit method. One fingertip unit is the amount of medication dispensed from the tip of the index finger to the crease of the distal interphalangeal joint and covers approximately 2% body surface area on an adult. Topical corticosteroids are applied once or twice per day for up to three weeks for super-high-potency corticosteroids or up to 12 weeks for high- or medium-potency corticosteroids. There is no specified time limit for low-potency topical corticosteroid use.

### Calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate (Taclonex) [^112mvbP9]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

5.1 Hypercalcemia and Hypercalciuria

Hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria have been observed with use of Taclonex Topical Suspension. If hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria develop, discontinue treatment until parameters of calcium metabolism have normalized. The incidence of hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria following Taclonex Topical Suspension treatment of more than 8 weeks has not been evaluated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Taclonex Topical Suspension can cause reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for clinical glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or upon withdrawal of treatment. Factors that predispose a patient to HPA axis suppression include the use of high-potency steroids, large treatment surface areas, prolonged use, use of occlusive dressings, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and young age.

Evaluation for HPA axis suppression may be done by using the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test. If HPA axis suppression is documented, gradually withdraw Taclonex Topical Suspension, reduce the frequency of application, or substitute with a less potent corticosteroid.

The following trials evaluated the effects of Taclonex Topical Suspension on HPA axis suppression:

In a trial evaluating the effects of Taclonex Topical Suspension and Taclonex Ointment on the HPA axis, 32 adult subjects applied both Taclonex Topical Suspension on the scalp and Taclonex Ointment on the body. Adrenal suppression was identified in 5 of 32 subjects (16%) after 4 weeks of treatment and in 2 of 11 subjects (18%) who continued treatment for 8 weeks. In another trial, 36 adult subjects applied Taclonex Topical Suspension on the body and scalp and 7 subjects applied Taclonex Topical Suspension on the body. Adrenal suppression occurred in 3 out of 43 subjects (7%) after 4 weeks of treatment and in none of the 36 subjects who continued treatment for 8 weeks [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].
In two trials, the effects of Taclonex Topical Suspension on the HPA axis were evaluated in 31 and 30 pediatric subjects aged 12 to 17 years old who applied Taclonex Topical suspension on the scalp and the scalp/body, respectively. Adrenal suppression occurred in 1 of 30 evaluable subjects (3%) after 4 weeks of treatment (scalp) and 5 of 31 evaluable subjects (16%) after up to 8 weeks of treatment (scalp and body) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

### Topical treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis [^111ioMy3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic plaque psoriasis is the most common type of psoriasis, and it is characterised by redness, thickness, and scaling. First-line management of chronic plaque psoriasis is with topical treatments, including vitamin D analogues, topical corticosteroids, tar-based preparations, dithranol, salicylic acid, and topical retinoids.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness, tolerability, and safety of topical treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis, relative to placebo, and to similarly compare vitamin D analogues (used alone or in combination) with other topical treatments.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to February 2011: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library (2011, Issue 2), MEDLINE (from 1948), EMBASE (from 1980), Science Citation Index (from 2008), Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (from 2008), BIOSIS (from 1993), Dissertation Abstracts via DialogClassic (all publication years), and Inside Conferences (all publication years). We identified ongoing and unpublished studies from the UK Clinical Research Network Study Portfolio and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials. We checked the bibliographies of published studies and reviews for further references to relevant trials, and we contacted trialists and companies for information about newly published studies. A separate search for adverse effects was undertaken in February 2011 using MEDLINE and EMBASE (from 2005). Final update searches for both RCTs and adverse effects were undertaken in August 2012. Although it has not been possible to incorporate RCTs and adverse effects studies identified through these final searches within this review, we will incorporate these into the next update.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing active topical treatments against placebo or against vitamin D analogues (used alone or in combination) in people with chronic plaque psoriasis.

Data Collection and Analysis

One author extracted study data and assessed study quality. A second author checked these data. We routinely contacted trialists and companies for missing data. We also extracted data on withdrawals and on local and systemic adverse events. We defined long-term trials as those with a duration of at least 24 weeks.

Main Results

This update added 48 trials and provided evidence on 7 new active treatments. In total, the review included 177 randomised controlled trials, with 34,808 participants, including 26 trials of scalp psoriasis and 6 trials of inverse psoriasis, facial psoriasis, or both. The number of included studies counted by Review Manager (RevMan) is higher than these figures (190) because we entered each study reporting a placebo and an active comparison into the 'Characteristics of included studies' table as 2 studies. When used on the body, most vitamin D analogues were significantly more effective than placebo, with the standardised mean difference (SMD) ranging from -0.67 (95% CI -1.04 to -0.30; 1 study, 119 participants) for twice-daily becocalcidiol to SMD -1.66 (95% CI -2.66 to -0.67; 1 study, 11 participants) for once-daily paricalcitol. On a 6-point global improvement scale, these effects translate into 0.8 and 1.9 points, respectively. Most corticosteroids also performed better than placebo; potent corticosteroids (SMD -0.89; 95% CI -1.06 to -0.72; I² statistic = 65.1%; 14 studies, 2011 participants) had smaller benefits than very potent corticosteroids (SMD -1.56; 95% CI -1.87 to -1.26); I² statistic = 81.7%; 10 studies, 1264 participants). On a 6-point improvement scale, these benefits equate to 1.0 and 1.8 points, respectively. Dithranol, combined treatment with vitamin D/corticosteroid, and tazarotene all performed significantly better than placebo. Head-to-head comparisons of vitamin D for psoriasis of the body against potent or very potent corticosteroids had mixed findings. For both body and scalp psoriasis, combined treatment with vitamin D and corticosteroid performed significantly better than vitamin D alone or corticosteroid alone. Vitamin D generally performed better than coal tar, but findings relative to dithranol were mixed. When applied to psoriasis of the scalp, vitamin D was significantly less effective than both potent corticosteroids and very potent corticosteroids. Indirect evidence from placebo-controlled trials supported these findings. For both body and scalp psoriasis, potent corticosteroids were less likely than vitamin D to cause local adverse events, such as burning or irritation. Combined treatment with vitamin D/corticosteroid on either the body or the scalp was tolerated as well as potent corticosteroids, and significantly better than vitamin D alone. Only 25 trials assessed clinical cutaneous dermal atrophy; few cases were detected, but trials reported insufficient information to determine whether assessment methods were robust. Clinical measurements of dermal atrophy are insensitive and detect only the most severe cases. No comparison of topical agents found a significant difference in systemic adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

Corticosteroids perform at least as well as vitamin D analogues, and they are associated with a lower incidence of local adverse events. However, for people with chronic plaque psoriasis receiving long-term treatment with corticosteroids, there remains a lack of evidence about the risk of skin dermal atrophy. Further research is required to inform long-term maintenance treatment and provide appropriate safety data.

### Desoximetasone (Topicort) [^113J6fAK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Effect on Endocrine System

Topicort Topical Spray is a topical corticosteroid that has been shown to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.

Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible HPA axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or upon withdrawal of the topical corticosteroid.

In a study including 21 evaluable subjects 18 years of age or older with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, adrenal suppression was identified in 1 out of 12 subjects having involvement of 10 to15% of body surface area (BSA) and 2 out of 9 subjects having involvement of > 15% of BSA after treatment with Topicort Topical Spray twice a day for 28 days [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Because of the potential for systemic absorption, use of topical corticosteroids may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. Factors that predispose a patient using a topical corticosteroid to HPA axis suppression include the use of high potency steroids, larger treatment surface areas, prolonged use, use of occlusive dressings, altered skin barrier, liver failure and young age.

An ACTH stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression.

If HPA axis suppression is documented, an attempt should be made to gradually withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid. Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency may require supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids.

Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and unmasking of latent diabetes mellitus can also result from systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids.

Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase the total systemic corticosteroid exposure.

Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from use of topical corticosteroids. Use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended due to numerically high rates of HPA axis suppression (the safety and effectiveness of Topicort Topical Spray have not been established in pediatric patients) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

5.2 Local Adverse Reactions with Topical Corticosteroids

Local adverse reactions may be more likely to occur with occlusive use, prolonged use or use of higher potency corticosteroids. Reactions may include atrophy, striae, telangiectasias, burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, and miliaria. Some local adverse reactions may be irreversible.

Vitamin D analogues — plaque-type psoriasis indication, dosing, efficacy, safety, and populations are summarized: dosing is "Twice daily to affected areas" for "Indication: Plaque-type psoriasis". In plaque-type body psoriasis, "70% to 74%" on calcitriol or calcipotriene ointment achieved "either 75% improvement or marked improvement to clearing" versus "18% to 19%" with placebo; in scalp psoriasis, "Sixty percent" on calcipotriene solution improved versus "17%" with placebo. For the combination calcipotriene/betamethasone ointment over 4 weeks, "48%" achieved absent or mild psoriasis compared with "16.5%" on calcipotriene, "26.3%" on betamethasone, and "7.6%" on placebo. "Use in combination with topical corticosteroids gives added benefit". Adverse effects include "Irritation in lesional and perilesional skin that is transient" and "Reversible elevation of serum calcium — more likely to occur patients treated with greater than 100 g/wk", and although it "Causes photosensitivity", there are "no contraindications to combining with UVB phototherapy" while corticosteroid-related effects "may occasionally occur". Pregnancy is "Category C" with "No information on excretion in breast milk", and "Pediatric use: Appears to be safe".

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^115hNVQ3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

As many of the included trials were short term, of just a few weeks' duration with no post‐treatment follow‐up, this limited the ability to detect adverse events that take months or years to develop, such as skin thinning or hypopigmentation. This can lead to interpretation as evidence of no effect when in fact it could be no evidence of an effect. These short trials are a snapshot of a patient's eczema journey involving many years of treatment, which further hampers the ability to detect potential adverse events. Trials of weekend (proactive) therapy provide some data on prolonged use of topical corticosteroid over several months albeit with less frequent use than the current standard daily application for the management of flares.

We excluded one large, notable trial (PETITE) from this review because it did not compare different strategies of using topical corticosteroid (Sigurgeirsson 2015). The PETITE trial randomised 2418 children to receive topical corticosteroid (mild/moderate) or topical calcineurin inhibitors, used as required, and followed them for five years. This trial reports that clinical skin thinning occurred in one of 1213 participants (0.08%) who used mild to moderate topical corticosteroid over five years. We mention the trial here for context as it is the only large trial of normal topical corticosteroid use over a long period.

### Safety and efficacy of calcipotriol plus betamethasone dipropionate gel in the treatment of scalp psoriasis in adolescents 12–17 years of age [^1165jNFu]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Psoriasis vulgaris is one of the most common chronic skin diseases, affecting 1–3% of the general population. The total prevalence of psoriasis in children aged < 18 years is approximately 0.7%, and the rate increases linearly with age from 0 to 18 years. Within the adolescent age group, quality of life may be significantly compromised, with social development being especially impaired. The overt visibility of plaques can prove particularly troublesome, and lesions of the scalp frequently present within this age group, which may result in alopecia in severe cases.

Topical vitamin D analogues and corticosteroids are established first-line treatments for scalp psoriasis, although safety concerns may accompany their use. Vitamin D analogues can cause skin irritation and hypercalcaemia, while corticosteroids are associated with local adverse events (AEs), including skin atrophy, striae and telangiectasia, as well as systemic AEs such as adrenal suppression. Combination of these topical agents capitalizes on their beneficial clinical characteristics and can allay side-effects. A fixed combination of calcipotriol plus betamethasone dipropionate in a single product is well tolerated and effective in treating psoriasis in adults and has demonstrated superior efficacy to monotherapy with its individual components.–Greater anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects are evident than for either active ingredient alone, and the onset of action is more rapid.–

Nonadherence to topical agents can limit their effectiveness, and, among adolescents, adherence to topical treatments is particularly poor owing to social pressures and inconvenience of using medication. The formulation prescribed can influence patients' day-to-day use, and poor cosmetic characteristics, including greasy and sticky application, are frequently cited as discouraging the use of psoriasis treatments. A more cosmetically acceptable and easy-to-use treatment in the form of a fixed-combination lipophilic, alcohol-free gel has demonstrated favourable patient-related benefits in adults, and may have increased acceptability in adolescents with psoriasis. The objective of this trial was to investigate safety, with particular focus on calcium metabolism and the effectiveness of once-daily calcipotriol plus betamethasone dipropionate gel in an adolescent population. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01120223).

### Combined oral pulse and topical corticosteroid therapy for severe alopecia areata in children: a long-term follow-up study [^111jBWvW]. Dermatologic Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

There are no widely accepted therapy protocols for severe alopecia areata (AA). We treated 65 children/adolescents with AA affecting > 30% of scalp. Fourty-three percent of patients had AA plurifocalis (AAP). Fifty-seven percent had AA subtotalis (AAS), AAP+ophiasis (AAP+OPH), and alopecia totalis/universalis (AT/AU). Long-term follow-up (median 96 months) data were available for 69% of patients. Oral dexamethasone (prednisolone 5 mg/kg equivalent) was given once in 4 weeks. Patients received 6, 9, or 12 pulses. Clobetasol propionate 0.05% ointment under plastic wrap occlusion was applied 6 days a week. Hair growth was assessed on a scale ranging 0–100% of regrowth in individual AA lesions. Regrowth > 50% was considered good response. Six to twelve months months after the therapy, 56.9% of patients had > 75% of hair regrowth. In AAP, 65.5% had complete regrowth. 61.5% of all patients were considered good responders. Significantly, higher percentage of good responders was found in AA lasting ≤ 12 months. No patients had serious side effects. There was no change in stability of the hair status at the long-term follow-up. Most AA patients had beneficial effects with this protocol. Best results were in AAP and AAP+OPH. Combined topical and oral pulse corticosteroid therapy of AA in children shows long-lasting results, without serious side effects.

### Long-term use of oral corticosteroids and safety outcomes for patients with atopic dermatitis [^1153iq2V]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory disease that causes serious morbidity, such as pruritus, impaired quality of life, and a range of comorbidities. AD is a lifelong condition that relapses chronically and needs constant care. Although AD is considered primarily a pediatric disease, studies have shown high rates of AD among adults as well. The prevalence of AD among adults ranged from 2.1% to 4.9% across countries, and up to 10% of adults required medication for moderate to severe AD due to inadequate response to topical therapies; the prevalence rates were higher among adult patients than among pediatric patients, of whom 1.5% required medication for moderate to severe AD.

As AD treatment strategies, international guidelines and expert opinions generally recommend that oral corticosteroids should generally be avoided or limited to the short term only as rescue therapy. Nonetheless, given the benefits of oral corticosteroids, including their effectiveness in allergic diseases, short-term safety, and low cost, many patients with moderate to severe AD are treated with oral corticosteroids for prolonged periods, which may constitute inappropriate or excessive use. However, oral corticosteroid treatment for prolonged periods could have an association with oral corticosteroid–related complications. Hence, clinical evidence informing patients and practitioners regarding the management of AD exacerbations in routine clinical practice is warranted.

Although previous studies among patients with asthma or rheumatic disease have suggested associations between long-term use of oral corticosteroids and various adverse events (AEs), there are few studies of patients with AD, to our knowledge. In addition, existing studies about corticosteroid use among patients with AD were conducted to evaluate the safety concerns primarily about topical corticosteroids. Considering the frequent use of oral corticosteroids among adults with AD and the potential association between long-term use of oral corticosteroids and AEs, some of which are severe, there is a need to investigate the safety of the long-term use of oral corticosteroids among adults with AD. Accordingly, we aimed to investigate the association between long-term use of oral corticosteroids and AEs among adult patients with AD in South Korea.
