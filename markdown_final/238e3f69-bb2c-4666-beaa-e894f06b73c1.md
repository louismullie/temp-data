## Question

What is the initial treatment for somebody that has evidence of hyperthyroidism with a TSH that is below. 005 and a T4 that is five. 04.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about managing a patient with TSH less than 0.005 mU/L and free T4 of 5.04 ng/dL, including confirmation of overt hyperthyroidism, etiologic workup, initial therapy, and monitoring plans. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether these labs confirm overt hyperthyroidism and how to interpret the severity. Then, I should verify the likely etiologies and the immediate tests needed to distinguish Graves' disease from toxic nodular disease and thyroiditis. Next, I will consider urgent symptomatic control with beta-blockers and when to add thionamides. After that, I need to outline definitive therapy options and how to choose among radioactive iodine, antithyroid drugs, and surgery using shared decision-making. Finally, I will detail monitoring protocols, special situations, and a concise initial plan with contingencies, making sure I double-check dosing and timing at each step.

> Let me first confirm the biochemical diagnosis and severity. A TSH less than 0.005 mU/L is profoundly suppressed and, when paired with an elevated free T4 of 5.04 ng/dL, establishes overt primary hyperthyroidism rather than subclinical disease, which requires normal free hormones with low TSH. This magnitude of TSH suppression and free T4 elevation indicates significant thyrotoxicosis and warrants prompt treatment and evaluation for complications such as atrial fibrillation and osteoporosis risk, especially in older adults or those with comorbidities [^1115ESS9] [^1149umNk].

> Wait, let me verify the likely etiologies before jumping to therapy. The most common cause is Graves' disease, but I should also consider toxic multinodular goiter, toxic adenoma, and destructive thyroiditis; distinguishing these drives both immediate management and long-term definitive therapy, so I need to check TRAb and consider radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) with scan or thyroid ultrasound with Doppler if the diagnosis remains uncertain after serology, since TRAb positivity supports Graves' disease and uptake pattern helps differentiate increased uptake (Graves', TMNG, TA) from low uptake (thyroiditis) [^111Sn8K5] [^1179Puf6] [^117E4w72].

> I should confirm immediate symptomatic needs. Beta-adrenergic blockade is first-line to control adrenergic symptoms like tachycardia, tremor, and anxiety; propranolol or atenolol are reasonable choices, and I need to ensure I start this promptly while the etiologic workup proceeds, adjusting the dose to heart rate and blood pressure response and tapering once thyroid hormone levels normalize to avoid bradycardia or hypotension [^116o1x3e].

> Hold on, I should verify when to initiate antithyroid drug therapy. If the patient has moderate to severe symptoms, high hormone levels, or risk factors for complications, starting a thionamide now is appropriate. Methimazole is preferred over propylthiouracil except in the first trimester of pregnancy or thyroid storm, with typical initiation at 10–20 mg daily and titration based on free T4 and total T3, recognizing that TSH will remain suppressed for months and is not reliable for early monitoring [^1136zUy4] [^112mXRxo] [^114mrL9g].

> Let me consider definitive therapy selection carefully. The three evidence-based options for overt Graves' hyperthyroidism are radioactive iodine, antithyroid drugs for 12–18 months with a remission rate around 30–50%, or thyroidectomy; choice should be individualized via shared decision-making considering age, comorbidities, goiter size, ophthalmopathy, pregnancy plans, access to expertise, and patient preferences, with no modality proven superior for long-term quality of life [^115bX6mZ] [^112za7GB] [^1115ESS9].

> I will now examine radioactive iodine specifics. If chosen, I should confirm a negative pregnancy test within 48 hours before dosing, counsel on radiation precautions, and plan close biochemical follow-up. Most patients improve within 4–8 weeks, hypothyroidism commonly emerges by 4–16 weeks, and early monitoring should rely on free T4 and total T3 rather than TSH because TSH remains suppressed for months. If hyperthyroidism persists beyond 6 months, retreatment with RAI or consideration of surgery is reasonable [^115b1Sq6] [^116o1x3e] [^114pDnmm].

> Next, I should review antithyroid drug strategy and monitoring. Methimazole is titrated to normalize free T4 and total T3 with checks every 4–6 weeks initially, then the dose is reduced by 30–50% once euthyroid. I need to counsel on agranulocytosis and hepatotoxicity warning signs, and check liver enzymes if cholestatic symptoms occur. Measuring TRAb before stopping can inform relapse risk, with higher TRAb predicting greater recurrence likelihood [^112mXRxo] [^1136zUy4] [^116Yxwm3].

> But wait, what if surgery is preferred or indicated. For large goiters, suspicion for malignancy, intolerance or failure of ATDs, or patient preference, total thyroidectomy offers high success but requires preoperative euthyroidism with methimazole and perioperative beta-blockade; I should coordinate postoperative levothyroxine dosing at about 1.6 mcg/kg/day and arrange TSH checks at 6–8 weeks with subsequent adjustments, ensuring calcium and PTH are monitored when total thyroidectomy is performed [^117LoSCf].

> I need to ensure I address special populations. In pregnancy, PTU is preferred in the first trimester with transition to methimazole thereafter, and RAI is contraindicated. In children and adolescents, ATDs are typically first-line with prolonged courses and careful growth monitoring. In older adults or those with cardiovascular disease, I should have a lower threshold for definitive therapy given higher risks of atrial fibrillation and bone loss with persistent hyperthyroidism [^114mrL9g] [^114amZFd] [^1149umNk].

> Let me double-check monitoring timelines so I do not miss early hypothyroidism or relapse. After starting methimazole, reassess free T4 and total T3 in 2–6 weeks and adjust the dose accordingly, repeating every 4–6 weeks until stable; after RAI, check free T4 and total T3 at 4–6 week intervals for 6 months or until hypothyroid and on replacement; after surgery, check TSH at 6–8 weeks and titrate levothyroxine to a TSH target appropriate for the clinical context, recognizing that TSH may lag for months after biochemical euthyroidism is achieved [^112mXRxo] [^116o1x3e] [^112UcR3F].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the free T4 of 5.04 might be in pmol/L and therefore only mildly elevated, but that would be a mistake. Given the context and typical assay reporting, 5.04 ng/dL is about 65 pmol/L, which is markedly elevated and consistent with severe overt hyperthyroidism, reinforcing the need for prompt beta-blockade and timely initiation of antithyroid therapy while the etiologic workup proceeds.

> Putting this together, my initial plan is to start a beta-blocker now for symptom control, order TRAb and consider RAIU with scan or thyroid ultrasound to determine etiology, and begin methimazole 10–20 mg daily if the patient is symptomatic or biochemically severely hyperthyroid, with close follow-up of free T4 and total T3 in 2–6 weeks. Concurrently, I will screen for atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis risk, and ophthalmopathy, and arrange shared decision-making to select among RAI, a 12–18 month ATD course, or surgery, with contingency plans for retreatment or escalation if hyperthyroidism persists or relapses [^115bX6mZ] [^111Sn8K5] [^112mXRxo] [^112za7GB].

Initial treatment for hyperthyroidism with TSH < 0.005 and T4 ~5.04 ng/dL is **methimazole 10–20 mg daily** [^1136zUy4] with beta-blocker (e.g. propranolol 20–40 mg every 6–8 hours) for rapid symptom control [^116o1x3e]. Confirm the diagnosis and etiology with **free T3, TRAb, and thyroid ultrasound** [^1179Puf6] [^111Sn8K5], and monitor liver enzymes and CBC at baseline and during therapy [^112mXRxo]. Adjust methimazole every 2–4 weeks to normalize free T4, then taper to a maintenance dose (5–10 mg/day) [^1136zUy4]; continue beta-blocker until symptoms resolve. Definitive therapy (**RAI or surgery**) should be discussed once euthyroidism is achieved [^115bX6mZ].

## Initial pharmacological management

### Antithyroid drug therapy

- **Methimazole (MMI)**: Preferred first-line agent due to efficacy, safety, and once-daily dosing [^1115ESS9].
- **Initial dose**: 10–20 mg daily; higher doses (20–30 mg) for severe hyperthyroidism or large goiters [^1136zUy4].
- **Mechanism**: Inhibits thyroid peroxidase, reducing thyroid hormone synthesis [^114mrL9g].

---

### Symptomatic management

Use **beta-blockers** (e.g. propranolol 20–40 mg every 6–8 hours) to control adrenergic symptoms (tachycardia, tremor, anxiety) [^116o1x3e]. Continue until free T4 normalizes and symptoms resolve.

---

## Diagnostic confirmation and etiological evaluation

Before initiating definitive therapy, **confirm the diagnosis and determine the underlying etiology**:

| **Test** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|
| Free T3 | Confirm severity; may be disproportionately elevated [^114fiaqB] |
| TRAb (TSH receptor antibodies) | Confirm Graves' disease [^111Sn8K5] |
| Thyroid ultrasound | Assess goiter, nodules, vascularity [^111Sn8K5] |
| Radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) | Differentiate Graves' vs. toxic nodular disease [^111Sn8K5] |

---

## Monitoring and dose adjustment

- **Initial monitoring**: Check free T4 and total T3 every 2–4 weeks after starting therapy [^notfound].
- **Dose adjustment**: Titrate to normalize free T4; TSH may remain suppressed for months [^112mXRxo].
- **Maintenance**: Once euthyroid, reduce to 5–10 mg/day; monitor every 2–3 months [^112mXRxo].

---

## Definitive therapy considerations

Definitive therapy (**RAI or surgery**) should be discussed once euthyroidism is achieved [^notfound]. Radioactive iodine is commonly preferred in the U.S., whereas antithyroid drugs are favored in Europe and Asia [^114ZnW2G]. Thyroidectomy is appropriate for large goiters, suspicion of malignancy, or patient preference [^117PxKjD].

---

## Safety monitoring

- **Baseline labs**: CBC, liver enzymes, and renal function prior to therapy.
- **Ongoing monitoring**: CBC and liver enzymes periodically during therapy.
- **Patient education**: Report fever, sore throat, or jaundice promptly (risk of agranulocytosis and hepatotoxicity) [^11349HZi].

---

## Summary of initial treatment plan

- **Start methimazole**: 10–20 mg daily.
- **Add beta-blocker**: Propranolol 20–40 mg every 6–8 hours for symptom control.
- **Confirm etiology**: Free T3, TRAb, ultrasound, and RAIU as indicated [^111Sn8K5].
- **Monitor and adjust**: Free T4 and total T3 every 2–4 weeks; titrate methimazole to normalize free T4 [^notfound].
- **Plan definitive therapy**: Discuss RAI or surgery once euthyroid [^115bX6mZ].

---

Initial treatment for severe hyperthyroidism with TSH < 0.005 and T4 ~5.04 ng/dL is **methimazole with beta-blocker**, plus confirmatory testing and close monitoring; definitive therapy is planned once biochemical control is achieved.

Differentiated thyroid cancer — thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression targets in long-term follow-up (Recommendation 70) are response-specific. In patients with a structural incomplete response to therapy, the serum TSH should be maintained below 0.1 mU/L indefinitely in the absence of specific contraindications (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). In patients with a biochemical incomplete response to therapy, the serum TSH should be maintained between 0.1 and 0.5 mU/L, taking into account the initial ATA risk classification, Tg level, Tg trend over time, and risk of TSH suppression (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). In patients who presented with high-risk disease but have an excellent (clinically and biochemically free of disease) or indeterminate response to therapy, consideration should be given to maintaining thyroid hormone therapy to achieve serum TSH levels of 0.1–0.5 mU/L for up to 5 years after which the degree of TSH suppression can be reduced with continued surveillance for recurrence (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). In patients with an excellent (clinically and biochemically free of disease) or indeterminate response to therapy, especially those at low risk for recurrence, the serum TSH may be kept within the low reference range (0.5–2 mU/L) (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). In patients who have not undergone remnant ablation or adjuvant therapy who demonstrate an excellent or indeterminate response to therapy with a normal neck US, and low or undetectable suppressed serum Tg, and Tg or anti-Tg antibodies that are not rising, the serum TSH can be allowed to rise to the low reference range (0.5–2 mU/L) (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence).

Recommendation 59 — initial thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression targets after initial therapy: For high-risk thyroid cancer patients, initial TSH suppression to below 0.1 mU/L is recommended (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). For intermediate-risk patients, initial TSH suppression to 0.1–0.5 mU/L is recommended (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). For low-risk patients after remnant ablation with undetectable serum thyroglobulin (Tg), TSH may be maintained at the lower end of the reference range (0.5–2 mU/L) while continuing surveillance for recurrence, with similar recommendations for those without remnant ablation and undetectable Tg (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). For low-risk patients after remnant ablation with low-level serum Tg, TSH may be maintained at or slightly below the lower limit of normal (0.1–0.5 mU/L) while surveillance continues, with similar recommendations for those without remnant ablation (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). For low-risk patients who have undergone lobectomy, TSH may be maintained in the mid to lower reference range (0.5–2 mU/L) while surveillance is continued, and thyroid hormone therapy may not be needed if patients can maintain serum TSH in this target range (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence).

ATA/AACE hypothyroidism — initial L‑thyroxine dosing: With initial thyroid hormone replacement, replacement therapy requires approximately 1.6 μg/kg of L‑thyroxine daily; patients who are athyreotic and those with central hypothyroidism may require higher doses, while patients with subclinical hypothyroidism or after treatment for Graves' disease may require less. In subclinical hypothyroidism, doses of 25–75 μg daily are usually sufficient for achieving euthyroid levels. One randomized controlled trial assigned starting doses by baseline thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) as 25 μg for TSH 4.0–8.0 mIU/L, 50 μg for TSH 8–12 mIU/L, and 75 μg for TSH > 12 mIU/L, and after 2 months only minimal further adjustments were required to achieve euthyroidism.

Monitoring of patients taking antithyroid drugs: An assessment of serum free T4 should be obtained about 4 weeks after initiation of therapy, and the dose of medication adjusted accordingly, and serum T3 also may be monitored since serum free T4 may normalize with persistent elevation of serum T3. Appropriate monitoring intervals are every 4–8 weeks until euthyroid values are achieved with the minimal dose of medication, after which biochemical testing and clinical evaluation can be undertaken at intervals of 2–3 months, and an assessment of serum free T4 and TSH are required before treatment and at intervals after starting treatment.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^116o1x3e]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 11 — patient follow-up after RAI therapy for GD: Follow-up within the first 1–2 months after RAI therapy for GD should include an assessment of free T4, total T3, and TSH, and biochemical monitoring should be continued at 4- to 6-week intervals for 6 months, or until the patient becomes hypothyroid and is stable on thyroid hormone replacement; strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Most patients respond with normalization of thyroid function and symptom improvement within 4–8 weeks, and hypothyroidism may occur from 4 weeks, with 40% hypothyroid by 8 weeks and > 80% by 16 weeks. Beta-blockers started prior to RAI should be tapered when free T4 and total T3 return to the reference range; as free T4 and total T3 improve, methimazole (MMI) can usually be tapered. Most patients eventually develop hypothyroidism indicated by free T4 below normal; levothyroxine should then be instituted, TSH should not be used initially to determine the need, and replacement dose should be adjusted based on free T4 with careful titration. Once euthyroidism is achieved, lifelong annual thyroid function testing is recommended at least annually, and since TSH may remain suppressed for a month or longer after hyperthyroidism resolves, interpret TSH cautiously and only with free T4 and total T3.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism — natural history and treatment evidence indicates that subclinical hyperthyroidism is present in about 2% of the U.S. population, one quarter of persons revert to a euthyroid state without medical intervention over time, and an estimated 1% to 2% of persons with TSH levels less than 0.1 mIU/L develop "overt" hyperthyroidism, whereas persons with TSH levels between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L are unlikely to progress; the USPSTF did not identify any studies evaluating benefits of treating subclinical hyperthyroidism on clinical health outcomes, and except for 1 small (n = 67) nonrandomized study of bone mineral density, no evidence was found on effects of treating "overt" hyperthyroidism.

Antithyroid drug dosing regimens for methimazole (MMI), carbimazole, and propylthiouracil (PTU): MMI and carbimazole, which is rapidly converted to MMI in the serum (10 mg of carbimazole is metabolized to approximately 6 mg of MMI), work in a virtually identical fashion. At the start of MMI therapy, higher doses are advised (10–20 mg daily) to restore euthyroidism, followed by titration to a maintenance level (generally 5–10 mg daily). PTU is usually administered two or three times daily, starting with 50–150 mg three times daily, with reduction to a maintenance PTU dose of 50 mg two or three times daily as thyroid function normalizes. Higher-dose "block and replace" combinations with l-thyroxine are not generally recommended, as they have been shown to result in a higher rate of ATD side effects.

### Hyperthyroidism: diagnosis and treatment [^117PxKjD]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

The proper treatment of hyperthyroidism depends on recognition of the signs and symptoms of the disease and determination of the etiology. The most common cause of hyperthyroidism is Graves' disease. Other common causes include thyroiditis, toxic multinodular goiter, toxic adenomas, and side effects of certain medications. The diagnostic workup begins with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level test. When test results are uncertain, measuring radionuclide uptake helps distinguish among possible causes. When thyroiditis is the cause, symptomatic treatment usually is sufficient because the associated hyperthyroidism is transient. Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and toxic adenoma can be treated with radioactive iodine, antithyroid drugs, or surgery, but in the United States, radioactive iodine is the treatment of choice in patients without contraindications. Thyroidectomy is an option when other treatments fail or are contraindicated, or when a goiter is causing compressive symptoms. Some new therapies are under investigation. Special treatment consideration must be given to patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, as well as those with Graves' ophthalmopathy or amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism. Patients' desires must be considered when deciding on appropriate therapy, and dose monitoring is essential.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116gv3zG]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

This work addressed diagnosis alone. Extrapolation of our findings appears logical, and there is no apparent a priori reason as to why TSH levels should be preferred over thyroid hormone levels in the context of monitoring thyroid treatments. Randomized trials might, nevertheless, reveal that additional considerations apply in these circumstances. Though there was no suggestion in the studies that we examined of a difference with individuals on thyroid hormone replacement, their numbers were small.

In summary, there is now matching theoretical and empiric evidence from a variety of sources suggesting that the thyroid status of an individual is better defined by thyroid hormone levels than TSH levels. There is evidence of a continuum of thyroid hormone effects along the continuum of thyroid hormone levels, with a possible optimum around the middle of the reference range. Though TSH levels remain good screening tests for overt thyroid dysfunction, it is theoretically and empirically more sound to rely on thyroid hormone and especially fT4 levels to classify the thyroid state.

This work should result in a simplification of the understanding of thyroid physiology and pathophysiology, and bring it more into line with the understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of other parameters, whereby the status of a parameter is judged by its level rather than the level of any controlling factor. Reconsideration of the TSH-based diagnostic approach to thyroid function appears to be indicated. In turn, this would appear to have implications for clinical guidelines, research methodology, and the rationale of underlying physiological principles.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: controversies in management [^113MXEky]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is an increasingly recognized entity that is defined as a normal serum free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine levels with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level suppressed below the normal range and usually undetectable. The thyroid-stimulating hormone value is typically measured in a third-generation assay capable of detecting approximately 0.01 microU per mL (0.01 mU per L). Subclinical hyperthyroidism may be a distinct clinical entity, related only in part to Graves' disease or multinodular goiter. Persons with subclinical hyperthyroidism usually do not present with the specific signs or symptoms associated with overt hyperthyroidism. A detailed clinical history should be obtained, a physical examination performed and thyroid function tests conducted as part of an assessment of patients for subclinical hyperthyroidism and to evaluate the possible deleterious effects of excess thyroid hormone on end organs (e.g., heart, bone). A reasonable treatment option for many patients is a therapeutic trial of low-dose antithyroid agents for approximately six to 12 months in an effort to induce a remission. Further research regarding the etiology, natural history, pathophysiology, and treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism is warranted.

### GRADE-ADOLOPMENT of hyperthyroidism treatment guidelines for a Pakistani context [^1122zV2f]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The outcome of the GRADE-ADOLOPMENT process applied to the 2016 American Thyroid Association Guidelines for Diagnosis and Management of Hyperthyroidism and Other Causes of Thyrotoxicosis yielded two major changes in the newly developed Pakistani EBCPG for the management of hyperthyroidism. These included the recommendation to assess only ALT (as opposed to a full LFT panel) amongst patients on ATDS experiencing symptoms highly specific of hepatotoxicity (as opposed to a higher index of suspicion considering non-specific symptoms like bloating, anorexia, nausea, or fatigue), and the recommendation to assess only FT4 (as opposed to the full panel of FT4, total T3, and TSH) at initial follow-up after RAI therapy for GD, with subsequent TSH assessment only in the case of low T4. The rationale behind both these changes were to prioritize patients' finances during the course of hyperthyroidism management and to limit the overuse of laboratory testing in a resource-constrained setting. Future research must investigate the cost-effectiveness and risk-benefit ratio of these modified recommendations.

Perioperative medication management and thyroid hormone replacement after thyroidectomy for Graves' disease — "Antithyroid drugs should be stopped at the time of thyroidectomy for GD, and beta-adrenergic blockers should be weaned following surgery". After surgery, "L-thyroxine should be started at a daily dose appropriate for the patient's weight (0.8 μg/lb or 1.7 μg/kg), and serum TSH measured 6–8 weeks postoperatively", and "Once stable and normal, TSH should be measured annually or more frequently if clinically indicated".

Subclinical Hyperthyroidism

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SCH) is defined with TSH levels below normal range with normal FT4 and FT3. Prevalence of SCH globally is 0.7% to 1.4%. SCH can progress to overt hyperthyroidism in 8% of patients by 1 year and 26% of patients by 5 year. In populations with sufficient iodine intake, GD is the cause of 40% of cases of SCH. Baseline serum level of TSH, not cause of disease, is the best predictor of progression of subclinical hyperthyroidism to overt hyperthyroidism.

Treatment of SCH is recommended when serum thyrotropin levels are < 0.1 mU/L, in persons aged > 65 years and postmenopausal women due to association with adverse outcomes including cardiovascular disease, bone loss, fractures, and dementia.MMI remains an effective and safe choice for SCH due to GD. For asymptomatic individuals aged < 65 years and a TSH level between 0.1 mIU/L and the lower limit of normal, observation is generally appropriate.

Thyroid Storm

Thyroid storm is an acute, life-threatening complication of hyperthyroidism that presents with multisystem involvement and is associated with a significant mortality rate of 8% to 25%. Goals of treatment are to control increased adrenergic tone, achieve euthyroidism quickly and safely by reducing thyroid hormone synthesis, block thyroid hormone release, inhibit peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, and reduce enterohepatic recycling of thyroid hormone (Table 4).–

Although all ATDs decrease thyroid hormone synthesis, the current ATA guidelines recommend initiating PTU in patients with thyroid storm as it blocks T4 to T3 conversion. However, recent data suggest no difference in cost, mortality, and adverse events for those treated with PTU versus MMI.

Antithyroid drug (ATD) therapy — monitoring schedule and dose adjustment: An assessment of serum free T4 and total T3 should be obtained about 2–6 weeks after initiation, and serum T3 should be monitored because serum free T4 may normalize despite persistent elevation of serum total T3; serum TSH may remain suppressed for several months and is therefore not a good early monitoring parameter. Once euthyroid, methimazole (MMI) dose can be decreased by 30%–50% with biochemical testing repeated in 4–6 weeks; once euthyroid on the minimal dose, evaluation can be undertaken at intervals of 2–3 months, and if receiving long-term MMI (> 18 months), the interval can be increased to 6 months.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: scientific review and guidelines for diagnosis and management [^111yYVBa]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Patients with serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels outside the reference range and levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and triiodothyronine (T3) within the reference range are common in clinical practice. The necessity for further evaluation, possible treatment, and the urgency of treatment have not been clearly established.

Objectives

To define subclinical thyroid disease, review its epidemiology, recommend an appropriate evaluation, explore the risks and benefits of treatment and consequences of nontreatment, and determine whether population-based screening is warranted.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biosis, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, National Guideline Clearing House, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Controlled Trials Register, and several National Health Services (UK) databases were searched for articles on subclinical thyroid disease published between 1995 and 2002. Articles published before 1995 were recommended by expert consultants.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

A total of 195 English-language or translated papers were reviewed. Editorials, individual case studies, studies enrolling fewer than 10 patients, and nonsystematic reviews were excluded. Information related to authorship, year of publication, number of subjects, study design, and results were extracted and formed the basis for an evidence report, consisting of tables and summaries of each subject area.

Data Synthesis

The strength of the evidence that untreated subclinical thyroid disease is associated with clinical symptoms and adverse clinical outcomes was assessed and recommendations for clinical practice developed. Data relating the progression of subclinical to overt hypothyroidism were rated as good, but data relating treatment to prevention of progression were inadequate to determine a treatment benefit. Data relating a serum TSH level higher than 10 mIU/L to elevations in serum cholesterol were rated as fair but data relating to benefits of treatment were rated as insufficient. All other associations of symptoms and benefit of treatment were rated as insufficient or absent. Data relating a serum TSH concentration lower than 0.1 mIU/L to the presence of atrial fibrillation and progression to overt hyperthyroidism were rated as good, but no data supported treatment to prevent these outcomes. Data relating restoration of the TSH level to within the reference range with improvements in bone mineral density were rated as fair. Data addressing all other associations of subclinical hyperthyroid disease and adverse clinical outcomes or treatment benefits were rated as insufficient or absent. Subclinical hypothyroid disease in pregnancy is a special case and aggressive case finding and treatment in pregnant women can be justified.

Conclusions

Data supporting associations of subclinical thyroid disease with symptoms or adverse clinical outcomes or benefits of treatment are few. The consequences of subclinical thyroid disease (serum TSH 0.1–0.45 mIU/L or 4.5–10.0 mIU/L) are minimal and we recommend against routine treatment of patients with TSH levels in these ranges. There is insufficient evidence to support population-based screening. Aggressive case finding is appropriate in pregnant women, women older than 60 years, and others at high risk for thyroid dysfunction.

### Management aspects of medical therapy in Grave's disease [^1179Puf6]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

The initial test for diagnosing hyperthyroidism is TSH. If TSH is suppressed, free T4 (FT4) and free T3 (FT3) should be measured. Suppressed TSH with high FT4 or FT3 or both confirms the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. In subclinical hyperthyroidism, TSH is suppressed, with normal FT4 and FT3. Total T4 and total T3 can be ordered if free hormone assays are unavailable. A FT3/FT4 ratio > 0.3 or total T3/T4 ratio of > 20 ng/μg may suggest GD.

Further testing with TSH/thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRAb) can be helpful in differentiating GD from other causes of hyperthyroidism. TRAb is more cost effective than images, and if positive, can confirm the diagnosis of GD. Measurement of TRAb level is a standard method for diagnosing, monitoring therapy, and prediction of remission or relapse in patients with GD. There are 2 available methods for detecting antibodies against TSH receptors: thyrotropin-binding inhibiting immunoglobulin (TBI/thyrotropin-binding inhibitory immunoglobulin) assay and the functional TSI bioassay. Although TSI is a subtype of TRAb, TBI assays are more commonly referred to as TRAb. TBI assays have evolved over time and the current third-generation binding assays are automated and have improved sensitivity and specificity of up to 97% and 99% for diagnosing GD. However, these are competitive assays and do not differentiate between stimulating, inhibiting, or neutral Abs. TSI, on the other hand, is a cell-based bioassay that specifically detects stimulating immunoglobulins and, when compared with TBI, is more sensitive.TRAb measurement can particularly be useful in certain clinical scenarios (Box). Although there is no consensus on the preferred type of immunoglobulin, following TSI has not shown a significant advantage over TRAb in predicting and managing Graves ophthalmopathy specifically. In clinical practice, competitive immunoassays are faster, automated, and more readily available, and therefore are used more commonly.

Graves' disease persistent hyperthyroidism after radioactive iodine (RAI) — When hyperthyroidism due to GD persists after 6 months following RAI therapy, retreatment with RAI is suggested, and in selected patients with minimal response 3 months after therapy additional RAI may be considered (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Response to RAI therapy can be assessed by monitoring the size of the gland, thyroid function, and clinical signs and symptoms; the goal of retreatment is to control hyperthyroidism with certainty by rendering the patient hypothyroid, patients with persistent, suppressed TSH with normal total T3 and free T4 may not require immediate retreatment but should be monitored closely, and in the small percentage refractory to several applications of RAI, surgery should be considered.

Hyperthyroidism — biochemical evaluation states that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement has the highest sensitivity and specificity of any single blood test in suspected hyperthyroidism and should be used as an initial screening test; when hyperthyroidism is strongly suspected, diagnostic accuracy improves when both a serum TSH and free T4 are assessed at the initial evaluation. The relationship between free T4 and TSH is an inverse log-linear relationship, so small changes in free T4 result in large changes in serum TSH, and serum TSH levels are considerably more sensitive than direct thyroid hormone measurements for assessing excess. In overt hyperthyroidism, both serum free T4 and T3 estimates are usually elevated and serum TSH is undetectable, whereas in milder hyperthyroidism serum T4 and free T4 can be normal, only serum T3 may be elevated, and serum TSH will be < 0.01 mU/L (or undetectable), a pattern called "T3-toxicosis"; assays for estimating free T3 are less widely validated than those for free T4, so measurement of total T3 is frequently preferred in clinical practice.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: clinical applications [^111trvZ4]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are diagnoses based on laboratory evaluation with few if any clinical signs or symptoms. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevation in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) above the upper limit of the reference range (0.45–4.5 mIU/L) with normal serum FT4 concentration; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a decrease in serum TSH below the reference range with normal serum FT4 and T3 concentrations. Though these conditions represent the earliest stages of thyroid dysfunction, the benefits of detecting and treating subclinical thyroid disease are not well established. Most persons found to have subclinical thyroid disease will have TSH values between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or between 4.5 and 10 mIU/L, for which the benefits of treatment are not clearly established; treatment may be beneficial in individuals with serum TSH lower than 0.1 mIU/L or higher than 10 mIU/L. This article illustrates approaches to managing patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism through 5 case scenarios that apply the principles of evidence-based medicine. Because of the substantial uncertainty concerning the consequences of untreated subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, as well as the benefit of initiating treatment, patient preferences are important in deciding on management of subclinical disease.

Hyperthyroidism management — surgery for TMNG or TA — If surgery is chosen as treatment for TMNG or TA, patients with overt hyperthyroidism should be rendered euthyroid prior to the procedure with methimazole pretreatment (in the absence of allergy to the medication), with or without beta-adrenergic blockade, and preoperative iodine should not be used in this setting. If surgery is chosen as treatment for TMNG, near- total or total thyroidectomy should be performed, and surgery for TMNG should be performed by a high-volume thyroid surgeon. If surgery is chosen as the treatment for TA, an ipsilateral thyroid lobectomy, or isthmusectomy if the adenoma is in the thyroid isthmus, should be performed, and we suggest that surgery for TA be performed by a high-volume surgeon. Following thyroidectomy for TMNG, we suggest that serum calcium or intact parathyroid hormone levels be measured, and that oral calcium and calcitriol supplementation be administered based on these results. Methimazole should be stopped at the time of surgery for TMNG or TA, and Betaadrenergic blockade should be slowly discontinued following surgery. Following surgery for TMNG, thyroid hormone replacement should be started at a dose appropriate for the patient's weight (0.8 mcg/lb or 1.7 mcg/kg) and age, with elderly patients needing somewhat less, and TSH should be measured every 1–2 months until stable, and then annually. Following surgery for TA, TSH and estimated free T4 levels should be obtained 4–6 weeks after surgery, and thyroid hormone supplementation started if there is a persistent rise in TSH above the normal range.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^112uyPJK]. Thyroid (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Thyrotoxicosis has multiple etiologies, manifestations, and potential therapies. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by coexisting medical conditions and patient preference. This document describes evidence-based clinical guidelines for the management of thyrotoxicosis that would be useful to generalist and subspecialty physicians and others providing care for patients with this condition.

Methods

The American Thyroid Association (ATA) previously cosponsored guidelines for the management of thyrotoxicosis that were published in 2011. Considerable new literature has been published since then, and the ATA felt updated evidence-based guidelines were needed. The association assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this report. They examined relevant literature using a systematic PubMed search supplemented with additional published materials. An evidence-based medicine approach that incorporated the knowledge and experience of the panel was used to update the 2011 text and recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting them were rated according to the approach recommended by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Group.

Results

Clinical topics addressed include the initial evaluation and management of thyrotoxicosis; management of Graves' hyperthyroidism using radioactive iodine, antithyroid drugs, or surgery; management of toxic multinodular goiter or toxic adenoma using radioactive iodine or surgery; Graves' disease in children, adolescents, or pregnant patients; subclinical hyperthyroidism; hyperthyroidism in patients with Graves' orbitopathy; and management of other miscellaneous causes of thyrotoxicosis. New paradigms since publication of the 2011 guidelines are presented for the evaluation of the etiology of thyrotoxicosis, the management of Graves' hyperthyroidism with antithyroid drugs, the management of pregnant hyperthyroid patients, and the preparation of patients for thyroid surgery. The sections on less common causes of thyrotoxicosis have been expanded.

Conclusions

One hundred twenty-four evidence-based recommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with thyrotoxicosis and to share what the task force believes is current, rational, and optimal medical practice.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^112MTEEc]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) screening for thyroid dysfunction — population is nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults; recommendation is "No recommendation. Grade: I statement (insufficient evidence)". Risk factors for an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level include female sex, advancing age, white race, type 1 diabetes, Down syndrome, family history of thyroid disease, goiter, previous hyperthyroidism, and external-beam radiation in the head and neck area; risk factors for a low TSH level include female sex; advancing age; black race; low iodine intake; personal or family history of thyroid disease; and ingestion of iodine-containing drugs, such as amiodarone. The primary screening test is serum TSH testing, and multiple tests over 3 to 6 months should be performed to confirm or rule out abnormal findings; follow-up testing of serum thyroxine (T4) levels in persons with persistently abnormal TSH levels can differentiate between subclinical (normal T4 level) and overt (abnormal T4 level) thyroid dysfunction. Hypothyroidism is treated with oral T4 monotherapy (levothyroxine sodium); consensus is lacking on the appropriate point for clinical intervention, especially for TSH levels < 10.0 mIU/L. Hyperthyroidism is treated with antithyroid medications (e.g., methimazole) or nonreversible thyroid ablation therapy (e.g., radioactive iodine or surgery), and treatment is generally recommended for patients with a TSH level that is undetectable or < 0.1 mIU/L, particularly those with overt Graves disease or nodular thyroid disease. The current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults.

5 Conclusions

Measurement of TRAb is useful both as a diagnostic and prognostic tool and can help inform shared decision making regarding the optimal therapy choice in Graves' thyrotoxicosis. High TRAbs suggest a greater likelihood of recurrence but an individual may value the opportunity to avoid long‐term medication despite this; these data suggest that chance is approximately 50% in those who complete a course of ATD.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^114fiaqB]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism — biochemical evaluation and assay pitfalls state that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement has the highest sensitivity and specificity of any single blood test used in the evaluation of suspected thyrotoxicosis and should be used as an initial screening test; when thyrotoxicosis is strongly suspected, diagnostic accuracy improves when a serum TSH, free T4, and total T3 are assessed at the initial evaluation. In overt hyperthyroidism, serum free T4, T3, or both are elevated, and serum TSH is subnormal (usually < 0.01 mU/L in a third-generation assay); in mild hyperthyroidism, serum T4 and free T4 can be normal with only serum T3 elevated and serum TSH low or undetectable; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a normal serum free T4 and normal total T3 or free T3, with subnormal serum TSH concentration, and a normal serum TSH level precludes the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis in the absence of a TSH-producing pituitary adenoma or thyroid hormone resistance or spurious interfering antibodies. Assays for estimating free T3 are less widely validated and less robust than those for free T4; therefore, measurement of total T3 is frequently preferred over free T3 in clinical practice. The term euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia refers to elevated T4 (and frequently elevated total serum T3) without hyperthyroidism from protein-binding abnormalities such as elevations in T4 binding globulin or transthyretin, familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia, and rarely immunoglobulins that directly bind T4 or T3; spurious results may arise from heterophilic antibodies causing high TSH, which should be ruled out by repeat testing, serial dilution, or anti-mouse antibody measurement, and ingestion of high doses of biotin may cause spuriously low results in assays that utilize a streptavidin–biotin separation technique.

### Antithyroid drug regimen for treating Graves' hyperthyroidism [^114GoVxz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Antithyroid drugs are widely used in the therapy of hyperthyroidism. There are wide variations in the dose, regimen or duration of treatment used by health professionals.

Objectives

To assess the effects of dose, regimen and duration of antithyroid drug therapy for Graves' hyperthyroidism.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Central), MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, CINAHL, HEALTHSTAR, Current Controlled Trials and reference lists. We contacted investigators and hand searched conference abstracts. Most recent search: June 2002.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials of antithyroid medication for Graves' hyperthyroidism were used.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trial allocation to included, excluded and awaiting assessment categories was made by consensus. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Pooling of data for primary outcomes, and select exploratory analyses were undertaken.

Main Results

Nineteen randomised trials involving 2233 participants were included. Overall the quality of trials as reported was poor; specifically in terms of allocation concealment, assessor blinding and loss to follow-up. Four trials examined the effect of duration of therapy on relapse rates of Graves' hyperthyroidism. In one trial using the Titration regimen, longer duration therapy (18 months) had significantly fewer relapses (37% vs 58%) than six month therapy (Odds ratio (OR) = 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.96). In one quasi-randomised trial using the Block-Replace regimen, there was no significant difference between the six and 12 month (relapses rates 41% versus 35%) arms of the study. Extending the duration of therapy to over 18 months was not associated with improved relapse rates (Peto OR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.43). Ten trials examined the effect of Block-Replace versus Titration regime. Relapse rates were similar in both groups at 54% in the Block-Replace group and 58% in the Titration group (Peto OR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.10). Participants reporting rashes (11% versus 5%) and withdrawing due to side effects (16% versus 9%) were significantly higher in the Block-Replace group compared to the Titration group respectively. Three studies considered the addition of thyroxine after initial therapy with antithyroid drugs. There was significant heterogeneity between the studies and the difference between the two groups were not significant (Odds ratio = 0.58, 95% CI 0.05 to 6.21).

Reviewers' Conclusions

The evidence (based on three studies) suggests that the optimal duration of antithyroid drug therapy for the Titration regimen is 12 to 18 months. The six month Block-Replace regimen was found to be as effective as the 12 month treatment in one quasi-randomised study. The Titration (low dose) regimen had fewer adverse effects than the Block-Replace (high dose) regimen and was no less effective in trials (based on 10 trials) of equal duration. The incidence of hypothyroidism was not reported and there were no deaths in the study populations.

Hyperthyroidism — etiology, complications, and defining laboratory pattern are outlined, noting that overt thyrotoxicosis is characterized by excess thyroid hormones in serum and suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) (< 0.01 mU/L). Painless thyroiditis accounts for about 10% of hyperthyroid cases and occurs in 5–10% of amiodarone-treated patients, while remission of GD has been reported in up to 30% of patients without treatment. Complications of untreated thyrotoxicosis include loss of weight, osteoporosis, atrial fibrillation, embolic events, and even cardiovascular collapse and death, and symptoms such as tachycardia and anxiety appear more pronounced in younger patients and those with larger goiters.

T3 measurement and therapy in biochemically euthyroid but symptomatic patients — A survey found that 22% of clinicians would measure serum T3 levels when faced with a biochemically euthyroid patient with persistent symptoms, yet no published studies have demonstrated that relatively low T3 levels have negative consequences for patients with normal serum TSH values, so this remains an untested hypothesis. Although there has been an increase in the use of LT3 therapy in the United States over the last 10 years, a 2011 survey reported that 3.6% of physicians would consider prescribing LT3 in such circumstances. An individual trial of T3 therapy to normalize serum T3 without lowering TSH below normal is unsupported by data and is an unproven approach; some task force members thought it could be considered on individual basis as innovative therapy, but when such treatments are used repeatedly they should become the object of formal research to determine safety and effectiveness, and outside a trial it is difficult to assess desired response and uncontrolled experience does not establish effectiveness.

Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. If the level is high, a program of fetal and neonatal surveillance for thyroid dysfunction should be initiated, whereas TRAb measurement is not necessary in an euthyroid pregnant patient previously found to have GD if she has an intact thyroid and she is not currently taking ATDs.

American Thyroid Association 2016 — post-lobectomy follow-up for TA: Following lobectomy for TA, TSH and estimated free T4 levels should be obtained 4–6 weeks after surgery, and thyroid hormone supplementation started if there is a persistent rise in TSH above the reference range (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). After lobectomy for TA, serum calcium levels do not need to be obtained and calcium and calcitriol supplements do not need to be administered. Thyroid hormone replacement is required in about 15%–20% of patients following thyroid lobectomy. TSH levels may remain in the high normal range for 3–6 months; therefore, continued monitoring for 4–6 months postoperatively is reasonable.

Hyperthyroidism management — radioactive iodine for toxic multinodular goiter (TMNG) or toxic adenoma (TA) — For radioactive iodine treatment of TMNG, sufficient radiation should be administered in a single dose to alleviate hyperthyroidism, and for TA, sufficient radiation to alleviate hyperthyroidism should be administered in a single dose. Follow-up within the first 1–2 months after radioactive iodine therapy for TMNG or TA should include an assessment of free T4, total T3 and TSH, and this should be repeated at 1–2 month intervals until stable results are obtained, then at least annually thereafter according to clinical indication. If hyperthyroidism persists beyond 6 months following 131I therapy for TMNG or TA, retreatment with radioactive iodine is suggested. Nonfunctioning nodules on radionuclide scintigraphy or nodules with suspicious ultrasound characteristics should be managed according to recently published guidelines regarding thyroid nodules in euthyroid individuals.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^1138vdXP]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

TSH as systemic indicator and its limitations — During initiation of LT4 therapy in myxedematous patients, serum TSH correlated well with both the administered dose (r = −0.9) and the serum FT4 concentration achieved (r = −1.0), and serum TSH has been accepted as a robust, sensitive, and reproducible indicator of thyroid status. The logarithmic relationship between TSH and thyroid hormone means that even with circulating T3 and T4 in the normal range euthyroidism cannot be assumed, and individual ranges for T3 and T4 are broader than individual variance, making measurement of T3 and T4 a suboptimal way to assess thyroid status; however, a caveat is that TSH remains normal in some LT4-treated hypothyroid patients with a high T4:T3 ratio even when T3 levels are lower than normal range.

Technical remarks state that once the diagnosis has been made, the treating physician and patient should discuss each of the treatment options and the selection should also take into account the local availability and the associated costs; when surgery is selected one should consider use of expert high-volume thyroid surgeons who on average have low rates of complications, and lack of that expertise should be considered against the known risk of alternative choices. Long-term continuous treatment of hyperthyroidism with ATDs may be considered in selected cases.

### The management of subclinical hyperthyroidism by thyroid specialists [^1126fhy5]. Thyroid (2003). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is a relatively common condition for which prospectively derived evidenced-based management guidelines do not exist. We have conducted a case-based mail survey to solicit opinions from members of the American Thyroid Association (ATA) about various issues that arise in the management of patients with this disorder. The survey was completed and returned by 185 of 300 (62%) of the original survey recipients. Four hypothetical cases varying in age, thyrotropin (TSH) level and underlying etiology were presented. The majority of respondents recommended further evaluation of all cases, most commonly choosing a radioactive iodine uptake (42%-71%), thyroid scan (39%-68%) and antithyroid (TPO/Tg) antibodies (49%-55%) as the additional tests to be ordered. The large majority (84%) recommended observation rather than active treatment for a young patient with a low but detectable serum TSH level. A small majority also recommended observation alone for a young woman with an undetectable serum TSH level (58%) and for an older woman with a low but detectable serum TSH value (63%). However, the majority (66%) favored treating an older woman with an undetectable serum TSH. When treatment was advised in the patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism, the respondents strongly favored anti-thyroid drugs when the etiology was Graves' disease and radioactive iodine when the etiology was toxic nodular thyroid disease. In the absence of adequate evidence-based guidelines, it is hoped that this survey of expert opinions may provide useful guidance for physicians providing care for patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism.

These clinical practice guidelines summarize the recommendations of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists for the diagnostic evaluation of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism and for treatment strategies in patients with these disorders. The sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH or thyrotropin) assay has become the single best screening test for hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, and in most outpatient clinical situations, the serum TSH is the most sensitive test for detecting mild thyroid hormone excess or deficiency. Therapeutic options for patients with Graves' disease include thyroidectomy (rarely used now in the United States), antithyroid drugs (frequently associated with relapses), and radioactive iodine (currently the treatment of choice). In clinical hypothyroidism, the standard treatment is levothyroxine replacement, which must be tailored to the individual patient. Awareness of subclinical thyroid disease, which often remains undiagnosed, is emphasized, as is a system of care that incorporates regular follow-up surveillance by one physician as well as education and involvement of the patient.

Nontoxic goiter — nonsurgical treatment includes iodine replacement, suppressive T4 therapy, and radioactive iodine (RAI) ablation; in an iodine-sufficient region trial, suppressive T4 therapy (target thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] 0.2–0.8 mU/l) plus iodine or alone decreased thyroid volume at 1 year, but has low efficacy with a temporary effect (regrowth to baseline within 2 years) and is associated with iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis, lifelong use, atrial fibrillation, and osteoporosis. RAI has long been used; in a randomized clinical trial of 131I versus T4 suppression, at 2 years goiter size was reduced by 44% versus 16%, and recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) enhances RAI uptake while adverse effects include transient posttreatment thyrotoxicosis, transient or permanent hypothyroidism, initial gland swelling (problematic in large goiters), and rare secondary malignancies. RAI is not appropriate with a suspicious thyroid nodule on imaging or cytology, during pregnancy or impending pregnancy, or if treatment or isolation constraints cannot be tolerated; in summary, RAI ablation may be considered for benign goiter in selected patients and T4-suppression should be avoided.

### Levothyroxine treatment for congenital hypothyroidism based on thyroid function: a 10-year clinical retrospective study [^1122y35z]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

In our retrospective observation of patients administered individualized dosages of levothyroxine according to their initial TSH level at diagnosis, after 1 month, there were four patients (10.8%) in group A, one patient (3.8%) in group B, four patients (23.5%) in group C, and three patients (8.3%) in group D who did not reach the normal TSH level. Furthermore, there were eight patients (21.6%) in group A, one patient (3.8%) in group B, and one patient (2.7%) in group D who had an FT4 level beyond the upper limit of normal values at 1 month following treatment. At the follow-up time, the dosage of levothyroxine for each patient was adjusted according to thyroid function, and their thyroid function eventually returned to a normal range. Our study suggests that to reduce the risk of levothyroxine overdose, individualized levothyroxine dosage should be adjusted. Currently, there is no exact dosage for patients with different TSH levels; however, for most patients with mildly elevated TSH, low-dose thyroxine could restore their TSH level to normal 1 month after treatment. It is critical to follow up regularly during treatment to monitor thyroid function and adjust the thyroxine dosage to maintain thyroid function within the normal range.

Research performed by Soliman et al. (2012) revealed that 25% of the patients (n = 45) treated with a high dose of levothyroxine (10–15 μg/kg·d) developed hyperthyroidism. Craven and Frank (2018) reported that a high initial levothyroxine dosage (> 12.5 μg/kg·d) may have caused hyperthyroidism. After a period of follow-up, more than half of the patients required a reduction in their dosage; thus, the authors suggested reducing the initial dosage to avoid overtreatment. Nevertheless, comparative studies between individualized treatment and high initial dosage treatment are scarce. We explored the correlation between levothyroxine dosage and patient thyroid function and between thyroid function restoration time and patient TSH levels after individualized treatment through a clinical retrospective study.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: a review of the clinical literature [^117EwFyN]. Endocrine Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SCHyper) is a biochemical diagnosis characterized by a decreased serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and normal serum thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations. Because SCHyper can be resolved, it is recommended to repeat serum TSH, T3, and T4 concentrations in 3 to 6 months before confirming a diagnosis of SCHyper to consider treatment. Proposed grading systems distinguish between mild (TSH, 0.1–0.4 mIU/L) and severe SCHyper (TSH, < 0.1 mIU/L) and are used alongside patients' age and the presence of risk factors and symptoms to guide treatment. Appropriate evaluation includes an investigation of the underlying cause and assessment of an individual's risk factors to determine the necessity and type of treatment that may be recommended. SCHyper may be associated with increased risks of cardiovascular-related adverse outcomes, bone loss, and in some studies, cognitive decline. Treatment may include observation without therapy, initiation of antithyroid medications, or pursuit of radioiodine therapy or thyroid surgery. Considerations for treatment include the SCHyper etiology, anticipated long-term natural history of the condition, potential benefits of correcting the thyroid dysfunction, and risks and benefits of each treatment option. The purpose of this overview is to provide a guide for clinicians in evaluating and managing SCHyper in the routine clinical practice.

Thyroid hormone (TH) measurements complement TSH — Serum TSH concentration is the single best biomarker to confirm a diagnosis and also the magnitude of primary thyroid disease, but T4 (and for specific constellations also T3) measurements are often added when TSH values fall outside the reference interval to classify disease into overt or subclinical and can direct therapeutic options. TH measurement is also required to complement TSH measurement in clinical situations such as pregnancy, intercurrent illness when TSH can be suppressed, and the initial treatment of hypo- or hyperthyroidism as the response of the pituitary-thyroid axis can be delayed after a change in thyroid status.

Background

Thyrotoxicosis has multiple etiologies, manifestations, and potential therapies. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by coexisting medical conditions and patient preference. This article describes evidence-based clinical guidelines for the management of thyrotoxicosis that would be useful to generalist and subspeciality physicians and others providing care for patients with this condition.

Methods

The development of these guidelines was commissioned by the American Thyroid Association in association with the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists. The American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this report. The task force examined relevant literature using a systematic PubMed search supplemented with additional published materials. An evidence-based medicine approach that incorporated the knowledge and experience of the panel was used to develop the text and a series of specific recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting each was rated according to the approach recommended by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Group.

Results

Clinical topics addressed include the initial evaluation and management of thyrotoxicosis; management of Graves' hyperthyroidism using radioactive iodine, antithyroid drugs, or surgery; management of toxic multinodular goiter or toxic adenoma using radioactive iodine or surgery; Graves' disease in children, adolescents, or pregnant patients; subclinical hyperthyroidism; hyperthyroidism in patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy; and management of other miscellaneous causes of thyrotoxicosis.

Conclusions

One hundred evidence-based recommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with thyrotoxicosis and to share what the task force believes is current, rational, and optimal medical practice.

### How should we treat patients with low serum thyrotropin concentrations? [^116SUZCg]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is defined by a low serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration in the presence of normal levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3). However, it is helpful to distinguish between those with a detectable but low TSH value (in the 0.1–0.4 mU/l range) and those with a fully suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mU/l), and we suggest the designation of grade I and grade II SH, respectively. Together, these patterns of thyroid function tests are found in 1–3% of the elderly population, and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in longitudinal epidemiological surveys. There are a number of causes for this picture, which include endogenous thyroid disease, drug effects and concomitant nonthyroidal illness. Treatments commonly employed in the management of thyrotoxicosis are effective at correcting the biochemical abnormalities of SH but have not been shown to improve clinical outcome or symptoms. There is little good quality evidence available to guide the assessment or management of these patients. This review summarizes the clinical significance of SH and aims to provide guidance about whether we should treat patients with low serum TSH concentrations.

### Update on the management of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism… [^11349HZi]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

Treatment is usually initiated with 30 mg of methimazole daily or 100 mg of propylthiouracil 3 times daily. The patient should be alerted to the major, albeit rare, adverse effects of these drugs, including agranulocytosis, liver disease, and a lupuslike syndrome that tend to occur within the first several months of therapy. Treatment involves the use of potassium perchlorate, a drug that blocks thyroid iodide transport, and propylthiouracil or methimazole to inhibit hormone biosynthesis. Hypothyroidism refers to any state that results in a deficiency of thyroid hormone, including hypothalamic or pituitary disease and generalized tissue resistance to thyroid hormone, and disorders that affect the thyroid gland directly. Since the former 2 forms of hypothyroidism are rare, this article will address the management of primary thyroid failure. The laboratory hallmark of primary hypothyroidism is an increased serum thyrotropin concentration.

Measurement of serum thyrotropin is the most sensitive test for detecting early thyroid failure, since an increase will antedate a decline of serum FT4 to subnormal by many months and sometimes years. Neonates and children require larger replacement doses. In patients without evidence of preexisting coronary heart disease, treatment is initiated with 50 µg/d of levothyroxine sodium and in young patients can be initiated with a full replacement dose. Serum thyrotropin, not FT4, is used to monitor replacement. Since it takes at least 4 weeks for thyrotropin to stabilize in response to levothyroxine, dose increases should not occur more frequently. Accordingly, the patient should be followed up at 1- to 2-month intervals initially, and the dose of levothyroxine should be increased gradually until the patient is clinically euthyroid, with the serum thyrotropin level in the normal range.

Subclinical hypothyroidism refers to the state in which an increased serum thyrotropin level is accompanied by a normal serum FT4 level in an asymptomatic patient. 24 Progression to overt hypothyroidism is likely if the serum thyrotropin level exceeds 10 mIU/L or if thyroid antibodies are present in high titer. Accordingly, if either of these findings is present, a case can be made for levothyroxine replacement. Moreover, some of these patients will have an abnormal serum lipid profile that may be corrected by replacement therapy.

Graves' disease (GD) hyperthyroidism — initial treatment modalities and patient-centered decision-making: Patients with overt Graves' hyperthyroidism should be treated with any of the following modalities: 131I therapy; antithyroid medication, or thyroidectomy. Once it has been established that the patient is hyperthyroid and the cause is GD, the patient and physician must choose between three effective and relatively safe initial treatment options: 131I therapy (radioactive iodine), anti-thyroid drugs (ATD), or thyroidectomy. In the United States, radioactive iodine has been the therapy most preferred by physicians, whereas in Europe and Japan there has been a greater physician preference for ATDs and/or surgery, and the long-term quality of life (QoL) following treatment for GD was found to be the same in patients randomly allocated to one of the three treatment options. Technical remarks state that once the diagnosis has been made, the treating physician and patient should discuss each of the treatment options, including the logistics, benefits, expected speed of recovery, drawbacks, potential side effects, and cost.

3.3 Predictive Factors for Recurrent Thyrotoxicosis

A comparison of demographic and clinical features between those in remission and those with recurrent thyrotoxicosis within 10 years is presented in Table 3. Younger age, longer duration of ATD treatment, higher TRAb concentration (at diagnosis and cessation of ATD) and longer duration to normalisation of fT4 and TSH were all associated with increased risk of recurrent thyrotoxicosis. Sex, thyroid hormone concentration at diagnosis, anti‐TPO antibody concentration and duration of normal fT4 and TSH during ATD therapy were not associated with recurrence risk. TRAb category both at diagnosis and cessation was significantly associated with the risk of recurrence at 5 and 10 years (Table 4). Survival curves demonstrating the association between TRAb category and recurrence over a 10‐year period are presented in Figure 2. Cox proportional hazard analysis identified the following as independent predictors of relapse: TRAb at diagnosis greater than 12 IU/L (HR 2.4 [95% CI 1.3–4.4], p 0.006), TRAb at cessation between 0.9 and 1.5 IU/L (HR 1.8 [95% CI 1.0–3.3], p = 0.044), TRAb at cessation greater than 1.5 IU/L (HR 2.3 [95% CI 1.3–4.0], p = 0.006) and younger age (HR 0.97 per year [95% CI 0.95–0.99], p = 0.004). TRAb at diagnosis between 5 and 12 (HR 1.2 [95% CI 0.7–2.2], p = 0.495) and time to normalisation of TSH (HR 1.04 per month [95% CI 0.99–1.09], p = 0.088) were not independently associated with recurrence risk in this model.

### GRADE-ADOLOPMENT of hyperthyroidism treatment guidelines for a Pakistani context [^116uYVXT]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

The second recommendation to undergo the adaptation process was related to thyroid status testing post-treatment by radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy for Graves' Disease (GD). The source EBCPG recommends assessing free T4 (FT4), total T3, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) amongst patients within 1–2 months after patients with GD receive RAI therapy, followed by 4–6 weekly testing for 6 months, or until the patient becomes hypothyroid and is stable on thyroid hormone replacement This recommendation was modified to advise the assessment of only FT4 at initial follow-up, with subsequent TSH assessment only in the case of low T4. The keystone of this modification was the consensus that FT4 alone is a sufficiently sensitive modality to detect post-RAI hypothyroidism, and that TSH suppression in the post-RAI period may limit its accuracy in reflecting thyroid status. In fact, this misleading suppression of TSH after RAI therapy may prompt the physician to initiate thioamides unnecessarily. Moreover, in Pakistan, the use of a single FT4 test (ranges from $4.92–8.30) is about a third the price of a full panel consisting of FT4, T3 and TSH ($12.7–18.1). In fact, a sizeable percentage (48.8%) of the overall management costs for hyperthyroidism are attributable to laboratory testing. Lastly, if both the initial FT4 and subsequent TSH assessment reflect hypothyroidism, and thyroid hormone replacement is initiated and optimized, long-term assessment of treatment effectiveness can be monitored by TSH alone. To facilitate adherence to follow-up and routine post-operative testing, it is recommended that public and private laboratories in Pakistan should partner with healthcare centers to create comprehensive and appropriate care packages which include all post-treatment management and surveillance.

Graves' disease (GD) in children — 131I pretreatment, safety, and follow-up — When children receiving methimazole (MMI) are to be treated with 131I, the medication is stopped 3–5 days before treatment, and patients are placed on beta-blockers until total T4 and/or free T4 estimate levels normalize. Although some physicians restart antithyroid drugs after 131I, this is seldom required in children, and thyroid hormone levels begin to fall within the first week after therapy. Radioactive iodine is excreted by saliva, urine, and stool, and families should adhere to local radiation safety recommendations. After 131I therapy, T3, T4, and/or estimated free T4 levels should be obtained every month; TSH determinations may not be useful early because they may remain suppressed for several months. Hypothyroidism typically develops by 2–3 months post-treatment, at which time levothyroxine should be prescribed. Although uncommon, there are rare reports of pediatric patients with severe hyperthyroidism who developed thyroid storm after receiving 131I.

American Thyroid Association (ATA) 2016 — Recommendation 86: We suggest that the physician contacted according to Recommendation 85 evaluate whether ATD withdrawal in the first trimester of pregnancy is likely to cause relapse of hyperthyroidism; if risk of relapse is considered low, therapy can be withdrawn and followed by weekly thyroid function testing during the first trimester. Patients who have been treated with ATD for 12–18 months a rapid relapse after withdrawal becomes less likely, even if the frequency of relapse may be in the order of 50% within 1 year. Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence.

Regarding specific circumstances for hyperthyroidism, more specifically with respect to patients with thyrotoxicosis due to destructive thyroiditis, ATA 2016 guidelines recommend to treat patients with mild symptomatic subacute thyroiditis initially with ß-adrenergic-blocking drugs and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Use corticosteroids instead of NSAIDs when patients fail to respond or present initially with moderate-to-severe pain and/or thyrotoxic symptoms.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) with TSH persistently below the lower limit of normal but ≥ 0.1 mU/L — treatment of SH should be considered in individuals ≥ 65 years of age and in patients with cardiac disease or symptoms of hyperthyroidism (2/+00). Persistence in this range is defined as a TSH level between 0.1 and 0.5 mU/L on repeated measurement over a 3–6-month period; the thyroid disorder underlying SH should be diagnosed to avoid treating transient, functional disorders related to acute illness, drugs, and other causes of low TSH. In symptomatic patients, a trial of beta-adrenergic blockers may be useful to determine whether symptomatic therapy might suffice.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) — prevalence and natural history show that in a representative U.S. sample without known thyroid disease, 0.7% had suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mU/L) and 1.8% had low TSH (< 0.4 mU/L). The natural history is variable, with annualized rates of 0.5%–7% progression to overt hyperthyroidism and 5%–12% reversion to normal TSH levels. Progression to overt hyperthyroidism appears more likely when TSH is suppressed (< 0.01 mIU/L) rather than low but detectable (0.01–0.4 mIU/L).

### Thyrotoxicosis [^1115ESS9]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Thyrotoxicosis is a common disorder, especially in women. The most frequent cause is Graves' disease (autoimmune hyperthyroidism). Other important causes include toxic nodular hyperthyroidism, due to the presence of one or more autonomously functioning thyroid nodules, and thyroiditis caused by inflammation, which results in release of stored hormones. Antithyroid drugs are the usual initial treatment (thionamides such as carbimazole or its active metabolite methimazole are the drugs of choice). A prolonged course leads to remission of Graves' hyperthyroidism in about a third of cases. Because of the low remission rate in Graves' disease and the inability to cure toxic nodular hyperthyroidism with antithyroid drugs alone, radioiodine is increasingly used as first line therapy, and is the preferred choice for relapsed Graves' hyperthyroidism. Total thyroidectomy is an option in selected cases. Future efforts are likely to concentrate on novel and safe ways to modulate the underlying disease process rather than stopping excess thyroid hormone production.

### What is the best definitive treatment for Graves' disease? A systematic review of the existing literature [^116saTAT]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists for Graves' disease (GD) include any of the following modalities: (131)I therapy, antithyroid medication, or thyroidectomy. No in-depth analysis has been performed comparing the treatment options, even though a single treatment option seems to be universally accepted.

Methods

A systematic review of the literature was performed to examine contemporary literature between 2001 and 2011 evaluating the management options of GD. We compiled retrospective and prospective studies analyzing surgery and radioactive iodine. Outcomes of interest included postoperative hypothyroidism, euthyroidism, and persistent or recurrent hyperthyroidism without supplementation. Success was defined as postoperative euthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Failure was defined as persistent or recurrent hyperthyroidism.

Results

Of the 14,245 patients, 4,546 underwent surgery [3,158 patients had subtotal thyroidectomy (STT) and 1,388 had total thyroidectomy (TT)] and 9,699 had radioactive iodine. The radioactive iodine group consisted of 2,383 patients receiving 1–10 mCi, 1,558 patients receiving 11–15 mCi, 516 patients receiving > 15 mCi, and 5,242 patients receiving an unspecified amount. Surgery was found to be 3.44 times more likely to be successful than radioactive iodine (p < 0.001). STT and TT were found to be 2.33 and 94.45 times more likely to be successful than radioactive iodine (p < 0.001), respectively.

Conclusions

On the basis of the outcomes analyzed, surgery appears to be the most successful in the management of GD, with TT being the preferred surgical option.

Objective

Thyrotoxicosis has multiple etiologies, manifestations, and potential therapies. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by coexisting medical conditions and patient preference. This article describes evidence-based clinical guidelines for the management of thyrotoxicosis that would be useful to generalist and subspeciality physicians and others providing care for patients with this condition.

Methods

The development of these guidelines was commissioned by the American Thyroid Association in association with the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists. The American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this report. The task force examined relevant literature using a systematic PubMed search supplemented with additional published materials. An evidence-based medicine approach that incorporated the knowledge and experience of the panel was used to develop the text and a series of specific recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting each was rated according to the approach recommended by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Group.

Results

Clinical topics addressed include the initial evaluation and management of thyrotoxicosis; management of Graves' hyperthyroidism using radioactive iodine, antithyroid drugs, or surgery; management of toxic multinodular goiter or toxic adenoma using radioactive iodine or surgery; Graves' disease in children, adolescents, or pregnant patients; subclinical hyperthyroidism; hyperthyroidism in patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy; and management of other miscellaneous causes of thyrotoxicosis.

Conclusions

One hundred evidence-based recommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with thyrotoxicosis and to share what the task force believes is current, rational, and optimal medical practice.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism — how to treat if chosen (Recommendation 77): If SH is to be treated, the treatment should be based on the etiology of the thyroid dysfunction and follow the same principles as outlined for the treatment of overt hyperthyroidism (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). Supporting text notes that the treatment of SH is similar to overt hyperthyroidism, that RAI is appropriate for most patients, especially in older patients when TMNG is a frequent cause of SH, and that there are no data to inform whether elderly patients would benefit from pretreatment with ATDs before RAI, with the risks of ATD therapy potentially outweighing any small benefit.
