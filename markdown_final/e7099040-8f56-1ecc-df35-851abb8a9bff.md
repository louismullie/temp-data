## Question

Normal urine creatinine level

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about normal urine creatinine levels, including how to express them, what ranges are expected, and how to interpret them in clinical practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical contexts in which urine creatinine is used. Then, I should verify the standard reference ranges for 24-hour urinary creatinine excretion by sex. Next, I will consider spot urine creatinine concentration and its variability. After that, I need to check how creatinine is used as a denominator in ACR/PCR and what assumptions underlie those ratios. Finally, I will integrate factors that modify interpretation and outline practical next steps when results are unexpected, anchoring to KDIGO and contemporary cohort data.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts where "normal urine creatinine" matters: assessing completeness of 24-hour urine collections, estimating muscle mass indirectly, and serving as the denominator in albumin-to-creatinine and protein-to-creatinine ratios. I should also remember that urine creatinine is not a direct measure of kidney function, even though it is influenced by renal handling and muscle mass, so I need to avoid overinterpreting a single value outside a ratio context [^notfound].

> Now, I will verify the classic 24-hour urinary creatinine excretion ranges. Traditional teaching cites approximately 20–25 mg/kg/day in men and 15–20 mg/kg/day in women, which corresponds to about 177–221 μmol/kg/day in men and 133–177 μmol/kg/day in women. Wait, let me verify the units and conversions to ensure I'm precise: yes, those conversions align with standard molecular weight considerations and are consistent with nephrology references [^116A64W6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about applying those ranges universally. I need to check whether these historic norms still fit contemporary populations. A large, population-based Swiss study found that rigid application of those classic cutoffs would misclassify many collections, especially in older adults, and proposed updated prediction equations for 24-hour creatinine excretion based on age, sex, and anthropometrics. So, while the traditional ranges remain a useful first pass, I should interpret individual results in light of body size, age, and sex, and consider using validated equations when accuracy is critical [^112T6u1R] [^116A64W6].

> Next, I should review spot urine creatinine concentration. I initially thought a typical spot creatinine might be around 50–200 mg/dL, but wait, I should double-check the variability. Spot urine creatinine varies widely with hydration, diet, and time of day, and there is no single "normal" spot concentration; instead, clinicians use spot creatinine to compute ACR or PCR, recognizing that the ratio partly adjusts for urine concentration, albeit imperfectly [^113f2XYy] [^113f2XYy].

> I will now examine the role of creatinine as a denominator in ACR and PCR. KDIGO assumes an average creatinine excretion rate of about 1 g/day (10 mmol/day) to relate ACR to albumin excretion rate; however, I need to ensure I flag that this assumption can be misleading in people with very low or very high muscle mass, in acute kidney injury, or with marked dietary changes, which can distort ACR/PCR independent of true albumin/protein excretion. In such cases, a timed collection or an adjusted estimate may be preferable [^114uHwqW] [^113f2XYy].

> Let me consider factors that modify interpretation so I don't overcall an abnormal result. Females generally have lower urinary creatinine excretion than males, so the same albumin load yields a higher ACR. Older age and lower muscle mass reduce creatinine excretion and can artifactually raise ACR. Acute kidney injury, low protein intake, and diuretics tend to lower urine creatinine, whereas high protein intake and strenuous exercise raise it. I should confirm any unexpected ACR/PCR with a first-morning sample and, if decisions hinge on accuracy, use a timed collection or cystatin C–based approaches [^113f2XYy] [^116PApfa] [^114uHwqW].

> But wait, what if the 24-hour collection seems "incomplete" based on creatinine? I should double-check the math and the patient's body weight before discarding the collection. Using sex-appropriate expectations and, when available, population-specific prediction equations can reduce misclassification; if the creatinine-to-weight ratio is off, repeating the collection or verifying with supervised collection is reasonable, especially when results will change management [^112T6u1R] [^116A64W6].

> Next, I should review practical steps when results are unexpected. If ACR is elevated, I need to ensure confirmation with a first-morning sample, exclude transient causes like exercise, menstruation, or infection, and consider repeating testing over 3–6 months to document persistence. If ACR is discordant with clinical context, I should consider measuring a timed albumin excretion rate or using cystatin C–based eGFR to refine risk assessment and avoid misclassification [^116PApfa] [^1153P6Xn] [^113ARykU].

> In summary, I should confirm that "normal" 24-hour urinary creatinine excretion is roughly 20–25 mg/kg/day in men and 15–20 mg/kg/day in women, while acknowledging that modern populations show substantial interindividual variability and that updated equations improve accuracy. Spot urine creatinine has no fixed normal range and should be interpreted in the context of ACR/PCR, with awareness of non-GFR determinants. When results are unexpected or decisions are high-stakes, repeat testing and, if needed, timed collections or cystatin C–based methods should be used to verify the finding [^116A64W6] [^112T6u1R] [^114uHwqW] [^113ARykU].

---

Normal urine creatinine excretion is **15–25 mg/kg/day** (133–221 µmol/kg/day) in men and **10–20 mg/kg/day** (88–177 µmol/kg/day) in women, reflecting muscle mass and diet [^116A64W6]. Spot urine creatinine typically ranges from **20–300 mg/dL**, but varies with hydration and urine concentration; thus, single values should be interpreted cautiously [^notfound]. For clinical use, creatinine is mainly used to normalize other analytes (e.g. ACR, PCR) and to assess collection completeness, rather than as a standalone diagnostic marker [^114uHwqW] [^116A64W6].

## Normal urine creatinine excretion

- **24-hour urine creatinine excretion**: This is the most reliable measure of daily creatinine output and reflects muscle mass and dietary protein intake [^116A64W6].

| **Population** | **Normal range (mg/kg/day)** | **Normal range (µmol/kg/day)** |
|-|-|-|
| Men | 15–25 | 133–221 |
| Women | 10–20 | 88–177 |

- **Factors influencing urine creatinine excretion**: Muscle mass, age, sex, and dietary protein intake significantly affect urine creatinine levels. Lower muscle mass, advanced age, and low protein intake reduce excretion, whereas higher muscle mass and high protein intake increase it [^113f2XYy].

---

## Spot urine creatinine concentration

Spot urine creatinine concentration varies widely with hydration and urine output; typical values are **20–300 mg/dL**, but this range is highly variable and should be interpreted in clinical context [^notfound].

---

## Clinical significance of urine creatinine

- **Assessment of kidney function**: Urine creatinine is primarily used to assess the completeness of 24-hour urine collections and to calculate creatinine clearance, a surrogate for glomerular filtration rate (GFR) [^116A64W6].
- **Normalization of urinary analytes**: Urine creatinine is used to normalize the concentration of other urinary analytes, such as albumin and protein, to account for variations in urine concentration. This is commonly done in the calculation of the albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) and protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR) [^114uHwqW].
- **Detection of diluted or adulterated samples**: Low urine creatinine levels (< 20 mg/dL) may indicate dilute or adulterated samples, which can affect the accuracy of urinary tests [^114oG7br].

---

## Factors influencing urine creatinine levels

Several factors can influence urine creatinine levels, including:

- **Muscle mass**: Higher muscle mass increases creatinine production and excretion.
- **Age and sex**: Younger individuals and males typically have higher urine creatinine levels due to greater muscle mass.
- **Dietary protein intake**: High protein diets increase creatinine excretion.
- **Hydration status**: Dehydration concentrates urine, increasing creatinine concentration, while overhydration dilutes it.
- **Kidney function**: Impaired kidney function can alter creatinine excretion, although urine creatinine is not a direct marker of kidney function [^116A64W6].

---

## Clinical implications of abnormal urine creatinine levels

Abnormal urine creatinine levels may indicate:

- **Low urine creatinine**: Reduced muscle mass, low protein intake, or dilute/adulterated samples.
- **High urine creatinine**: Increased muscle mass, high protein intake, or dehydration.

---

## Limitations of urine creatinine measurement

While urine creatinine is useful for normalizing urinary analytes and assessing collection completeness, it has limitations:

- **Variability**: Urine creatinine levels vary significantly between individuals and within the same individual, limiting its standalone diagnostic utility [^116xacj7].
- **Non-specific**: Urine creatinine is not a specific marker of kidney function and should be interpreted alongside other clinical and laboratory findings [^111NHckj].
- **Influence of external factors**: Diet, hydration, and muscle mass significantly affect urine creatinine levels, necessitating careful interpretation [^113f2XYy].

---

Normal urine creatinine excretion ranges from **10–25 mg/kg/day**, varying with sex, age, and muscle mass. Spot urine creatinine varies widely and should be interpreted in context. Urine creatinine is mainly used to normalize other analytes and assess collection completeness, not as a standalone diagnostic marker.

### Urinary kidney injury biomarkers and urine creatinine normalization: a false premise or not? [^113eHktC]. Kidney International (2010). Low credibility.

Substantial research has focused on the discovery of urinary biomarkers to detect acute kidney injury (AKI) before a rise in serum creatinine. As in chronic kidney diseases, the concentrations of urinary AKI biomarkers have been normalized to urine creatinine concentration to account for creatinine clearance and urine flow. Waikar et al. challenge the assumption that normalization to creatinine clearance in a chronic disease state can be extrapolated to an acute state, in which creatinine clearance is, by definition, changing acutely.

Early detection of any chronic disease, including CKD, provides greater opportunities to reduce morbidity as treatments can be initiated earlier in the disease course, and knowledge of level of albuminuria and GFR also helps guide clinical decisions beyond initiating treatments specifically for CKD. Thus, initial testing of blood and urine to detect CKD is important, with confirmatory testing if initial findings indicate the presence of abnormalities of creatinine/eGFR or albuminuria.

### Biological markers of acute kidney injury [^117PdxEu]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

An abrupt change in serum creatinine, the most common indicator of acute kidney injury (AKI), is strongly linked to poor outcomes across multiple clinical settings. Despite endless attempts to distill the magnitude and timing of a changing serum creatinine into a standardized metric, singular focus on this traditional functional marker obligates the characterization of AKI to remain, at best, retrospective and causally noninformative. The resultant inability to meaningfully segregate critical aspects of injury such as type, onset, propagation, and recovery from ongoing decrements in renal function has hindered successful translation of promising therapeutics. Over the past decade, however, the emerging field of clinical proteomics reinvigorates hope of identifying novel plasma and urine biomarkers to characterize cause and course of kidney injury. Efforts to validate these markers for use in clinical studies now show early promise but face important obstacles including interpretive difficulties inherent in using serum creatinine as a sole comparator for diagnostic performance, a need to better evaluate the incremental performance of new markers above established clinical and biochemical predictors, a relative lack of power to sufficiently examine hard clinical end points, and a potential over-reliance on use alone of receiver operating curves for assessing biomarker utility. Here, we discuss efforts to address these barriers and further ascertain the clinical value of new markers.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — result confirmation and accurate quantification: There is biological and analytical variability in urine albumin and urine protein loss, and all of these can lead to false detection of CKD or its progression; thus, positive tests should be confirmed, especially in people without risk factors for CKD. Change in creatinine concentration in the urine can also lead to observed changes in ACR or PCR, independently of changes in protein loss, and if a more accurate quantification of albuminuria or total proteinuria is required, measure urine albumin or total protein in a timed collection under supervised conditions as recommended above.

Background

Creatinine is a break-down product of the intracellular creatinine precursors creatine and creatine- phosphate. Most of the creatinine is derived from nonenzymatic processes occurring in skeletal muscle at a fairly constant rate, depending on muscle mass. Creatinine is freely filtered out of the blood by the glomerulus and is neither reabsorbed nor metabolised by tubular cells. Proximal tubular secretion accounts for 10% to 20% of total urinary creatinine in patients with normal renal function, a percentage that rises as the glomerular filtration rate falls. Creatinine excretion in the urine occurs at a fairly constant rate over 24 hours and is, therefore, used as a reference comparator for analysis performed on spot urine and timed urine samples.

Measurement of urinary creatinine excretion in the clinical and research fields has multiple purposes: 1) to measure creatinine clearance as a surrogate of the glomerular filtration rate; 2) to estimate average 24-hour excretion rates of several solutes including electrolytes and proteins from spot urine samples, using the respective ratios to urinary spot creatinine concentration; 3) to assess lean body mass; and 4) to check the completeness of 24-hour urine collections. The latter can be estimated from knowledge of the normal rate of creatinine excretion, which is equal to creatinine production in the steady state. In longitudinal trials reporting completeness criteria of the 24-hour urine collection, intra-individual variation in creatinine output of repeated collections was used as a quality assurance tool to assess the accuracy. However, in the case of a single patient's measure and in large scale epidemiologic studies, the identification of over- and under- collection of 24-hour urine samples remains a crucial but difficult task.

The accuracy of a 24-hour urine collection is mainly evaluated by computing the creatinine excretion per kilogram body weight over 24 hours. According to the general nephrology references, the daily creatinine excretion should be 177 to 221 μmol/kg (20 to 25 mg/kg) in men and 133 to 177 μmol/kg (15 to 20 mg/kg) in women. These reference values rely on observations performed in the 1960s and 1970s in relatively small and mostly selected groups (for example, hospitalised patients).

The European population has markedly changed over the last 50 years, aging progressively and showing a steadily increasing prevalence of obesity. Both these factors impact on the body composition and on the proportion of muscle mass, the main determinant of urinary creatinine excretion. The adequacy of the classical reference values to the European general population should, therefore, be questioned.

Urine arsenic interpretation — reference thresholds highlight that normal total urine arsenic levels may vary from laboratory to laboratory but may be defined by the laboratory as a urine arsenic greater than 50 µg/L, 100 µg/g creatinine, or 100 µg total arsenic. With acutely symptomatic arsenic toxicity, total urine arsenic is typically greater than 1000 µg/L. The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists' Biological Exposure Index for arsenic is 35 µg/L urine arsenic at the end of the workweek, and at background exposure levels the upper 95th percentile for total urinary arsenic was 65.4 µg/L or 50.2 µg/g creatinine; many laboratories report the 24-hour urine arsenic level as both µg/L and µg/g.

### Normalization of urinary biomarkers to creatinine during changes in glomerular filtration rate [^116xacj7]. Kidney International (2010). Low credibility.

Urinary biomarkers, such as albumin and other markers of kidney injury, are frequently reported as a normalized ratio to urinary creatinine (UCr) concentration [UCr] to control for variations in urine flow rate. The implicit assumption is that UCr excretion is constant across and within individuals, such that changes in the ratio will reflect changes in biomarker excretion. Using computer simulations of creatinine kinetics, we found that normalized levels of a biomarker reflecting tubular injury can be influenced by dynamic changes in the UCr excretion rate when the glomerular filtration rate changes. Actual timed urine collections from hospitalized patients with changing glomerular filtration rates and/or critical illness exhibited variability in UCr excretion rates across and within individuals. Normalization by [UCr] may, therefore, result in an underestimation or overestimation of the biomarker excretion rate depending on the clinical context. Lower creatinine excretion in the setting of acute kidney injury or poor renal allograft function may amplify a tubular injury biomarker signal, thereby increasing its clinical utility. The variability of creatinine excretion, however, will complicate the determination of a threshold value for normalized biomarkers of acute or chronic kidney disease, including albumin. Thus, we suggest that the most accurate method to quantify biomarkers requires the collection of timed urine specimens to estimate the actual excretion rate, provided that the biomarker is stable over the period of collection. This ideal must be balanced, however, against practical considerations.

AUA/SUFU neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction — laboratory assessment of renal function in spinal cord injury (SCI): Serum creatinine levels in SCI are significantly lower than in ambulatory individuals and levels below normal are expected; a significant rise from baseline, even within the normal range, should prompt careful assessment. Creatinine clearance by 24-hour urine collections is more sensitive but time consuming, and cystatin C is thought to be superior to serum creatinine in SCI, although its widespread use appears limited due to cost concerns.

KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) staging — Table 2 uses serum creatinine (SCr) and urine output thresholds. Stage 1: SCr 1.5–1.9 times baseline or ≥ 0.3 mg/dl (≥ 26.5 μmol/l) increase; urine output < 0.5 ml/kg/h for 6–12 hours. Stage 2: SCr 2.0–2.9 times baseline; urine output < 0.5 ml/kg/h for ≥ 12 hours. Stage 3: SCr 3.0 times baseline or increase in serum creatinine to ≥ 4.0 mg/dl (≥ 353.6 μmol/l) or initiation of renal replacement therapy or, in patients < 18 years, decrease in eGFR to < 35 ml/min per 1.73 m2; urine output < 0.3 ml/kg/h for ≥ 24 hours or anuria for ≥ 12 hours.

### Controversies in acute kidney injury: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) conference [^112gvZAp]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

It remains unclear how to best determine baseline kidney function. What constitutes a baseline serum creatinine level is controversial and inconsistently defined. It would be ideal to have prior serum creatinine or GFR measurements widely available through electronic medical records, but this is not current practice in many parts of the world. Prior serum creatinine or GFR measures may also further elucidate the risk of AKI in patients considered at high risk on the basis of either comorbidity or an intervention. There is controversy about whether an acute decrease in serum creatinine level indicates AKI that has already occurred, and more research is needed in this area. For example, small declines in serum creatinine level need to be interpreted with caution because they may be the result of acute changes in creatinine production or volume of distribution. After a timed insult (e.g. coronary angiography, elective surgery, nephrotoxic drug exposure), serum creatinine level should be measured at an appropriate time, allowing for AKI to manifest. After AKI onset, serum creatinine level should be measured during follow-up as necessary for clinical management and care transitions (e.g. transfer to and from intensive care) and for determining changes in AKI staging and classification (AKI vs. AKD), including onset of CKD at 90 days.

How urine output should be evaluated is also an area that needs further investigation to avoid variability in reporting of AKI incidence (i.e. use of actual or ideal body weight, strict time period vs. time-averaged values). Future guidelines should address how differences in body composition (overweight, fluid overload) affect the interpretation of urine output, and whether these differences need to be considered in regard to the thresholds for AKI. Similarly, fluid status should be considered when evaluating for AKI. Fluid overload is associated with increased mortality and AKI, and it may impact the diagnosis of AKI through its impact on the volume of distribution of serum creatinine. Although there are research methods to define fluid overload, these are not routinely used in clinical practice, and it is unclear whether there is sufficient evidence to define a clinical threshold for fluid overload. In the next AKI guideline, fluid overload should be defined operationally through a rigorous literature review.

### Chronic kidney disease: detection and evaluation [^117R5P3C]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease affects 47 million people in the United States and is associated with significant health care costs, morbidity, and mortality. Because this disease can silently progress to advanced stages, early detection is critical for initiating timely interventions. Multiple guidelines recommend at least annual screening with serum creatinine, urine albumin/creatinine ratio, and urinalysis for patients with risk factors, particularly diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and a history of cardiovascular disease. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for chronic kidney disease in the general population, and the American College of Physicians recommends against screening asymptomatic adults without risk factors. Persistently elevated serum creatinine and albuminuria are diagnostic and prognostic hallmarks of chronic kidney disease. Lower levels of albuminuria are associated with adverse renal and cardiovascular outcomes. Serum cystatin C is a novel biomarker that is most useful when a false-positive decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate calculated from serum creatinine is suspected. New guidelines incorporate albuminuria into the classification framework for chronic kidney disease and elaborate on identification of the disease, the frequency of follow-up, and recommendations for nephrology referral. Nephrology consultation is indicated for patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL per minute per 1.73 m2, persistent urine albumin/creatinine ratio greater than 300 mg per g or urine protein/creatinine ratio greater than 500 mg per g, or if there is evidence of a rapid loss of kidney function. A multidisciplinary approach between primary care physicians, nephrologists, and other subspecialists for implementing early interventions, providing education, and planning for advanced renal disease is key for effective management.

### How to use… serum creatinine, cystatin C and GFR [^116d865s]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2017). Low credibility.

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the best overall measure of kidney function. The GFR is relatively low at birth but increases through infancy and early childhood to reach adult levels of approximately 120mL/min/1.73m 2 by age 2. While GFR can be measured most accurately by the urinary clearance of an exogenous ideal filtration marker such as inulin, it is more clinically useful to estimate GFR using a single serum measurement of an endogenous biomarker such as creatinine or cystatin C. When in steady state, there is an inverse relationship between creatinine/cystatin C and GFR, allowing GFR to be estimated from either using simple equations. Because of the non-linear relationship between creatinine/cystatin C and GFR, relatively small initial increases in these markers represent significant decreases in GFR. While cystatin C is produced by all nucleated cells, creatinine is a waste product of muscle metabolism and is therefore influenced by diet and muscle mass/body habitus. Decreased GFR is used to diagnose and stage chronic kidney disease (CKD) using the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes system. A diagnosis of CKD requires GFR < 60mL/min/1.73m 2 for more than 3months; higher GFR also represents CKD if evidence of kidney damage (such as albuminuria or abnormal imaging) is present. Changes in serum creatinine and urine output are used to diagnose acute kidney injury. It is possible to calculate a kinetic GFR when the creatinine is changing rapidly, though more complex calculations are required.

### The urine output definition of acute kidney injury is too liberal [^116ste6k]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Key messages

- A urine output threshold for defining AKI of < 0.5 ml/kg/hour over 6 hours is too liberal.

- A threshold of < 0.3 ml/kg/hour over 6 hours better fits with the plasma creatinine definition of AKI by having a similar sensitivity for a clinically relevant outcome.

- AKI may be diagnosed from urine output in as little as 2 to 3 hours.

- The urine output threshold for AKI should be adjusted for duration of urine collection.

- **AKI may be defined as**: Urine output (ml/kg/hour) < 0.03 × duration of collection (hours) + 0.11, where the duration is between 3 and 9 hours.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^113PHkPK]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO AKI diagnosis — urine output versus serum creatinine (SCr) explains that both are measures of acute change in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), with urine output responding faster; if GFR suddenly falls to zero, a rise in SCr would not be detectable for several hours while urine output would be affected immediately. Studies using both measures show increased incidence, suggesting SCr alone may miss patients, and using urine output criteria (criterion 3) reduces discordance between criterion 1 and criterion 2, capturing cases such as B, C, D, and F.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^117BU21f]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 chronic kidney disease — Table 16 factors causing biological variation in urine albumin or urine protein identifies causes of falsely elevated albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) or protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR) and causes of false decreases. Hematuria, menstruation, and exercise increase albumin and protein in the urine, symptomatic urinary infection can cause production of protein from the organism, and for nonalbumin proteins other proteins may be missed by albumin reagent strips. Variability in urinary creatinine concentration modifies ACR and PCR: females have lower urinary creatinine excretion, therefore higher ACR and PCR, while males have higher urinary creatinine excretion, therefore lower ACR and PCR; low urinary creatinine excretion consistent with low weight can cause high ACR or PCR relative to timed excretion, while high urinary creatinine excretion consistent with high weight can cause low ACR or PCR relative to timed excretion; lower urinary creatinine excretion with AKI or low-protein intake contrasts with high urinary creatinine excretion with high-protein intake or exercise.

Table 7
Review of assays to assess albuminuria

Table 8
Definitions of albuminuria a

The JNC 7, the National Kidney Foundation (NKF), and the ADA all recommend the use of morning spot albumin/creatinine measurement for annual quantitative testing for urine albumin in adults with diabetes. Individuals should be fasting. The optimal time for spot urine collection is the early morning, but for minimizing variation, all collections should be at the same time of day; the individual preferably should not have ingested food for at least 2 h.

Positive test results represent "albuminuria" in these guidelines, corresponding to protein excretion of > 300 mg/24 h, > 200 μg/min, or > 300 mg/g creatinine (Table 8). In these patients, quantitative measurement of urine albumin excretion is used in assessing the severity of albuminuria and its progression, in planning treatment, and in determining the impact of therapy. To properly assess the stage of kidney disease, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) can be calculated from the serum creatinine value, age, sex, and race of the patient. An eGFR of < 60 mL/min, regardless of the presence of low levels of albuminuria, is an independent cardiovascular risk factor. A urine albumin value of < 30 mg/g creatinine, although considered "normal", should be reassessed annually, because values as low as 10 mg/g creatinine have been associated in some studies with an increased cardiovascular risk. If the value is ≥ 30 mg/g creatinine, changes should be reassessed after 6 to 12 months if antihypertensve therapy is required or annually in those who are normotensive. For children with type 1 diabetes, testing for low levels of albuminuria is recommended to begin after puberty and after a diabetes duration of 5 years. Of note is that most longitudinal cohort studies have reported significant increases in the prevalence of low levels of albuminuria only after diabetes has been present for 5 years.

In the algorithms of both the NKF and the ADA for urine protein testing, the diagnosis of low levels of albuminuria requires both the demonstration of increased albumin excretion (as defined above) on two of three tests repeated at intervals of 3 to 6 months and the exclusion of conditions that "invalidate" the test (Fig. 1).

### How to measure proteinuria? [^114Riz3B]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To examine the use of urine total protein compared with albumin measurements to assess and monitor patients with chronic kidney disease.

Recent Findings

Urine albumin or total protein-to-creatinine ratio measurements on a single-voided specimen provide a convenient and reliable alternative to 24-h urine measurements. The majority of studies that inform current renoprotective strategies have relied upon urine total protein measurements. Urine albumin measurements are required to detect microalbuminuria. The proportion of urinary protein composed of albumin is variable and may depend on the underlying renal disease.

Summary

Urine protein-to-creatinine measurements should continue to be used for the assessment and monitoring of patients with nondiabetic chronic kidney disease. Urine albumin-to-creatinine measurements should be reserved for detecting microalbuminuria and monitoring patients with diabetic nephropathy. Further research is required to investigate the relationship between urine total protein and albumin in different renal diseases and to compare the prognostic significance of urine total protein with that of albumin.

KDIGO 2024 CKD guideline — Practice Point 1.1.1.2 on confirmatory testing after incidental findings states: "Following incidental detection of elevated urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), hematuria, or low estimated GFR (eGFR), repeat tests to confirm presence of CKD". It adds that "there is known biological and analytical variability in SCr and in urine albumin or urine protein", that "any unexpected results should be verified before diagnosing a person as having CKD", that "subsequent testing should be performed to confirm the diagnosis and to complete the evaluation, as is required", and that "timing of the repeat sample should be determined based on clinical setting including risk factors for CKD as well as concern for AKI/AKD".

### Perioperative acute kidney injury: diagnosis, prediction, prevention, and treatment [^115G3zHo]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic Criteria

Common definitions of AKI rely on changes in serum creatinine and absolute urine output to provide an easy to interpret, objective, and validated approach useful for epidemiologic studies; however, each component of common AKI metrics has limitations. Notably, urine output is significantly influenced by hypovolemia and diuretics, decreasing specificity, while serum creatinine only begins to increase after 50% of functional nephrons are lost, and these changes may not manifest for 48 to 72 h after injury, leading to low sensitivity in previously healthy kidneys. Furthermore, serum creatinine can be impacted by nonrenal factors including age, muscle mass, nutritional status, liver function, and gastrointestinal elimination, further limiting diagnostic accuracy, and not all patients have a recorded baseline serum creatinine. Despite these limitations, serum creatinine remains the standard biomarker for AKI in perioperative practice.

The KDIGO criteria, currently used to define AKI, update two previous consensus definitions, (1) Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-stage Renal Disease (RIFLE)and (2) AKI-Network (AKIN), to capture patients with smaller creatinine increases, allowing earlier disease detection.

### Non-linear relationship between urinary creatinine and diabetic kidney disease: implications for clinical practice [^116ir9Mb]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD) is one of the most common and serious complications among diabetic patients, particularly prevalent in those with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). The occurrence of DKD significantly impacts the quality of life of patients and is linked to cardiovascular health and overall prognosis. Increasingly, global research has demonstrated that early identification and intervention for DKD are crucial for improving patient outcomes.

In recent years, urine creatinine (UCr) has garnered attention as a routine marker of kidney function. Variations in UCr levels can reflect the status of renal function; however, its role in the early screening and risk assessment of DKD has not been fully elucidated. Studies indicate that changes in urinary creatinine excretion may be associated with tubular dysfunction, a condition that exhibits certain specificity in diabetic patients. Therefore, understanding the relationship between UCr and DKD, as well as its impact on the incidence and severity of DKD, is essential for improving clinical management and patient prognosis.

This study aims to explore the relationship between UCr and the risk and severity of DKD in patients with T2DM. By comparing clinical data between patients with and without DKD, we hope to establish UCr as a potential biomarker with clinical value in predicting the onset of DKD and assessing its severity. Through a detailed analysis of the relationship between changes in UCr and DKD, we aim to provide new insights for the early identification and intervention of diabetic kidney disease, thereby enhancing the overall health and quality of life of diabetes patients. This research will also contribute to a theoretical framework for understanding the interplay between UCr levels and DKD, potentially informing early screening and management strategies in clinical practice.

### Arsenic exposure, assessment, toxicity, diagnosis, and management: guidance for occupational and environmental physicians [^112WPpe5]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Urine arsenic testing — specimen type, creatinine adjustment, dietary confounding, and alternative matrices are characterized as follows: Traditionally, a 24-hour urinary arsenic was considered the most definitive diagnostic laboratory test, but a spot urine arsenic is much easier to collect and is now more commonly used to assess individual patients and in large population studies. Adjusting the urine arsenic by the creatinine concentration may theoretically account for dilution or concentration of the spot urine (µg/g creatinine), and adjusting the arsenic concentration for creatinine concentration is recommended by some authors for spot urine arsenic samples; however, many population studies of drinking water arsenic exposure use spot urine arsenic levels, which are not adjusted for creatinine, and because creatinine concentration in the urine is significantly associated with age, sex, race/ethnicity, and body mass index, variations in µg/g creatinine may reflect the creatinine denominator rather than exposure. Ingestion of shellfish, fish, or seaweed can cause elevated total urine arsenic and confound the estimation of iAs exposure; speciation of urine arsenic levels allows the quantification of inorganic arsenic and its methylated metabolites and shows organic forms, and a spot urine arsenic could be collected again after 1 to 2 weeks abstinence from seafood or fish consumption. Urine should be collected in metal-free polyethylene containers but not acid-rinsed containers, and if urine arsenic is normal and arsenic toxicity is still suspected, hair and nail testing may help identify arsenic exposure.

### Screening for kidney diseases: older measures versus novel biomarkers [^112YaAVE]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Biomarkers have been used to screen for kidney disease since creatinine was recognized to be correlated with renal function. The measurement of serum creatinine as a screening test for kidney disease falls short, however, because serum creatinine is not particularly sensitive for the diagnosis of kidney disease. Creatinine reflects renal filtering capacity, which has a lot of reserve and is therefore not sensitive to acute or chronic kidney injury unless the injury is substantial enough to compromise the filtering ability. The sensitivity of serum creatinine is further diminished in certain patient populations that are prone to kidney disease because of the physiology of creatinine. Therefore, researchers are seeking new biomarkers that can aid in the diagnosis of both acute and chronic kidney diseases. The limitations of creatinine in screening for kidney diseases in specific patient populations as well as new potential biomarkers that are actively being researched are discussed in this review.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for lipid management in CKD: summary of recommendation statements and clinical approach to the patient [^114Ej9Zu]. Kidney International (2014). Medium credibility.

Criteria for acceptable predonation albuminuria — albumin excretion rate (AER) in the general population — states that, because of variability in urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) and its relationship to urine AER, the WG "recommends confirmation in all cases", with "The preferred confirmatory test is urine AER, expressed as mg/d" and "If urine AER is not available, a repeat ACR is acceptable". In healthy young adults, "The normal level of AER in healthy young men and women is less than 10 mg/d", the "coefficient of variation for repeated measurements is approximately 30%", and "repeated measurements are preferred for assessment of albuminuria". Risk anchoring uses "a reference ACR of 5 mg/g (0.5 mg/mmol)", and "KDIGO 2012 CKD guideline defines AER > 30 mg/d for 3 months or more as satisfying the criteria for CKD". Category descriptors specify that "AER less than 30 mg/d… with 10 to 29 mg/d considered as 'high normal'; AER 30 to 300 mg/d is defined as moderately increased…; and AER greater than 300 mg/d is defined as severely increased". In population risk estimates, a meta-analysis of "nearly 5 million healthy persons… from 7 general population cohorts found that each 10-fold increase in urinary ACR was associated with 3 times the risk of ESKD over median cohort follow-up of 4 to 16 years", and lifetime risk modeling shows that for "urine ACR less than 10 mg/g… lifetime risk for white men and white women was less than 1% at all ages, but exceeded 2% for black men younger than 40".

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of acute hepatic porphyrias: expert review [^111iFHfg]. Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Best Practice Advice 2: Initial diagnosis of AHP should be made by biochemical testing measuring ALA, PBG, porphyrins, and creatinine in a random urine sample.

Diagnosis of symptomatic AHP requires biochemical testing. The hallmark of acute attacks is significantly elevated ALA and PBG in the urine or plasma. In all AHP except ALAD porphyria, PBG is elevated. During acute attacks, both ALA and PBG are elevated at least 5-fold the upper limit of normal. The levels are high enough that a random urine sample is sufficient and a 24-hour urine collection is not recommended. To adjust for differences in the degree of urinary concentration, ALA and PBG excretion should be normalized to that of creatinine. It is important to note that because ALA and PBG are porphyrin precursors, they are not included in tests of porphyrins, which typically measure porphyrins in urine or stool that have been separated and quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Urine porphyrins should not be used alone as a screening test for AHP. Mild and nondiagnostic elevations in urinary porphyrins (secondary porphyrinurias) are often incorrectly interpreted as indicating AHP and lead to erroneous overdiagnosis.

### Diagnostic value of urinary sodium, chloride, urea, and flow [^1133HscU]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Up to 30% of hospitalized critically ill patients may have a rise in serum creatinine concentration. In addition to history and physical examination, there is diagnostic value in assessing urinary electrolytes, solute excretion, and urine flow in these patients. The correct interpretation of these urinary parameters can avoid unnecessary volume overload and mechanical ventilation, risk factors for increased mortality in patients with rising serum creatinine. The present article also discusses the role of arterial underfilling in causing prerenal azotemia in the presence of an increase in total body sodium and extracellular fluid expansion. As with extracellular fluid volume depletion, arterial underfilling secondary to impaired cardiac function or primary arterial vasodilation can delay or prevent recovery from ischemic or toxic acute tubular necrosis. The present brief review discusses the various aspects of the correct interpretation of urinary electrolytes, solute excretion, and urine flow in the setting of a rising serum creatinine concentration.

### New anthropometry-based age-and sex-specific reference values for urinary 24-hour creatinine excretion based on the adult Swiss population [^112T6u1R]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Although widely used as an accuracy marker of 24-hour urine collections, the current reference values for 24-hour urinary creatinine excretion are poorly representative of the general adult European population. Their systematic application would lead us to discard - because of suspected over- or under-collection - more than half of the 24-hour urinary collections in the whole population and two thirds of the urinary collections of people over 60 years old in the two population-based samples analysed in this study.

We propose a validated prediction equation for 24-hour urinary creatinine excretion in the general European population and a few derived normograms, based on readily available variables, which should help healthcare providers and researchers interpreting the completeness of an individual 24-hour urinary collection in daily clinical practice and in epidemiological population studies.

KDIGO 2024 — Factors affecting interpretation of urine albumin or protein — Understand factors that may affect interpretation of measurements of urine albumin and urine creatinine and order confirmatory tests as indicated. Hematuria, menstruation, exercise, and infection can falsely elevate albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) or protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR) by increasing albumin and protein in urine, while nonalbumin proteins can cause a false decrease because other proteins may be missed by albumin reagent strips. Variability in urinary creatinine concentration also affects ratios: females have lower urinary creatinine excretion therefore higher ACR and PCR, whereas males have higher urinary creatinine excretion therefore lower ACR and PCR; low weight with low urinary creatinine excretion can cause high ACR or PCR relative to timed excretion, whereas high weight with high urinary creatinine excretion can cause low ACR or PCR relative to timed excretion; lower creatinine excretion with acute kidney injury or low-protein intake, and higher creatinine excretion with high-protein intake or exercise, also influence results.

Guideline 1. Screening and diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease — Microalbuminuria is the best available test for screening of DKD, but it is imprecise, and markers under study include urinary immunoreactive intact albumin and shed podocytes, genetic risk indicators, blood and/or urine changes in growth factors, cytokines, inflammatory markers, or markers of oxidative stress, and innovative kidney imaging or tissue studies. Appropriately weighted risk algorithms should be derived using predictive variables, including AER within the normalalbuminuric or microalbuminuric range, retinopathy status, clinical and ambulatory blood pressure measurements, glycemic control, lipid levels, age, sex, race, and family history. Improved measures of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) should be developed and may include more reliable creatinine measurement methods, modifications of existing formulas, application of new GFR markers, such as cystatin C, and development of simplified direct GFR measurements. Additional studies on urinary albumin measurements, including predictive values of gender-specific ACR cutoffs, urine collection methods, and processing of urine samples, are warranted, and research questions include the rate of progression of DKD in people with reduced GFR but normal urinary albumin excretion compared with those with elevated urinary albumin excretion, whether regression of albuminuria modifies long-term progression, the effect of promising agents to prevent RCN in CKD across both types of diabetes, and the best common definition of RCN.

Urinary chemistries vary widely in both health and disease and are affected by diet, volume status, medications, and disease states. When properly examined, these tests provide important insight into the mechanism and therapy of various clinical disorders that are first detected by abnormalities in plasma chemistries. These tests cannot be interpreted in isolation, but instead require knowledge of key clinical information, such as medications, physical examination, and plasma chemistries, to include kidney function. When used appropriately and with knowledge of limitations, urine chemistries can provide important insight into the pathophysiology and treatment of a wide variety of disorders.

Acute hepatic porphyria (AHP) diagnostic algorithm — spot urine testing and actions: Patients with symptoms suggestive of AHP undergo spot urine testing for aminolevulinic acid (ALA), porphobilinogen (PBG), and creatinine; if the branch shows "Urine ALA/PBG > 10 mg/g creatinine", the pathway proceeds to genetic testing to determine the specific AHP, whereas if "Urine ALA/PBG normal", AHP is excluded as a cause of symptoms. Urine total porphyrins are not recommended as a screening test and testing is most informative during symptoms, and if only ALA is elevated, lead level and urine organic acids should be checked to rule out lead poisoning and hereditary tyrosinemia.

Urinary free cortisol (UFC) testing — false positives, false negatives, and renal effects: At the recommended cutoff point, false-positive elevations of UFC may be seen in several conditions, and high fluid intake (≥ 5 liters/d) significantly increases UFC; in conditions that increase cortisol production, a normal result is more reliable than an abnormal one. At the recommended cutoff point, false-negative results from urine cortisol collections also may occur; because UFC reflects renal filtration, values are significantly lower in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment, and a falsely low UFC can occur when creatinine clearance falls less than 60 ml/min, with UFC levels falling linearly with more severe renal failure; UFC can be normal if a patient has cyclic disease or in some patients with mild Cushing's syndrome.

KDIGO 2024 chronic kidney disease (CKD) — point-of-care testing (POCT) for creatinine and urine albumin reports that studies addressed measurement bias (n = 1), analytical variability (n = 5), analytical sensitivity (n = 2), and analytical specificity (n = 63), with specificity ranging from 17.5 to 99.5 when evaluative ACR ≥ 30 mg/g (≥ 3 mg/mmol) and 30.0–98.7 when evaluative ACR ≥ 300 mg/g (≥ 30 mg/mmol); for PCR, specificity ranged from 80.8–96.9 when evaluative PCR ≥ 200 mg/g (≥ 20 mg/mmol) and 75.6–95.2 when evaluative PCR > 500 mg/g (> 50 mg/mmol). The evidence regarding the performance of POCT for creatinine and urine albumin is heterogeneous; the certainty of evidence for POCT for creatinine testing was rated as low and for urine albumin was very low. For albuminuria testing, devices should have 95% sensitivity for the detection of albuminuria, which is not always achieved by POCT devices. Given the cost-effectiveness benefits, availability of the test in the absence of laboratory studies, and the acceptable test performance, the Work Group judged that in specific clinical scenarios, POCT should be used.

### Magnitude of underascertainment of impaired kidney function in older adults with normal serum creatinine [^1126vXcH]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To estimate in a community-dwelling elderly population the magnitude of renal function misclassification, occurring when persons with normal serum creatinine have reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and to describe the participant characteristics related to misclassification.

Design

Cross-sectional.

Setting

Population-based study of older Italian people.

Participants

Six hundred sixty participants aged 65 to 92 with normal serum creatinine.

Measurements

GFR was estimated using the Cockcroft-Gault equation and creatinine clearance (CrCl) calculated from 24-hour urine collection.

Results

In participants with normal serum creatinine, 39% and 25% had moderate renal function impairment (GFR < 60 mL/min) according to the Cockcroft-Gault equation and CrCl calculation, respectively. Prevalence of moderate renal impairment in those aged 65 to 74, 75 to 84, and 85 and older was 18.6%, 58.3%, and 96.8%, respectively (P for trend < .001) according to the Cockcroft-Gault equation, and 15%, 35.7%, and 58.7%, respectively (P for trend < .001) based on the CrCl calculation. In addition, female sex (P < .001) and normal or underweight (P < .05) were factors associated with high risk of misclassification.

Conclusion

Serum creatinine alone is one of the most widely used methods of assessing renal function in clinical practice despite its well-known poor correlation with GFR. A large proportion of older persons with impaired renal function are not diagnosed if clinicians rely solely on normal serum creatinine as evidence of normal renal function. Opportunities may be missed for slowing progression of kidney disease, managing comorbidities and complications related to renal impairment, and adjusting drug dosage for renal function.

There is known biological and analytical variability in serum creatinine (SCr) and in urine albumin or urine protein not related to their properties as markers of kidney disease. In people without risk factors for CKD, there is a low pretest probability for CKD and any unexpected results should be verified before diagnosing a person as having CKD. In people with risk factors for CKD, there is a higher probability that the person does have CKD even with an unexpected finding, and subsequent testing should be performed to confirm the diagnosis and to complete the evaluation, as is required. Timing of the repeat sample should be determined based on clinical setting including risk factors for CKD as well as concern for AKI/AKD.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^1158msPy]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

Appendix J. Approaches for eGFR calculation — glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is described as the best overall index of kidney function and a measure of how quickly plasma is filtered each minute by the nephron; in young adults normal GFR is approximately 90–130 mL/min and it declines on average 0.8–1.0 mL/min/year after age 30. In clinical practice, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is obtained from validated equations using creatinine, cystatin C, or both, and any estimate assumes steady-state kidney function; if kidney function is changing (e.g. AKI), the creatinine or cystatin C value is unstable and the estimating formulas should not be used, with rising levels in a non-steady state leading formulas to overestimate GFR and falling levels leading formulas to underestimate GFR. eGFR is used for screening for chronic kidney disease (CKD) with urine albumin/creatinine assessment, determining CKD severity, and monitoring progression of kidney disease, and knowing the level of GFR is important for medication prescribing.

AKI staging application and clarifications — Patients are "staged according to the highest (worst) stage", and because "SCr is measured and GFR can only be estimated, creatinine criteria should be used along with urine output for the diagnosis (and staging) of AKI". The text notes that "The changes in GFR that were published with the original RIFLE criteria do not correspond precisely to changes in SCr". For those reaching Stage 3 by creatinine, "For patients reaching Stage 3 by SCr > 4.0 mg/dl (> 354 μmol/l)… we instead require that the patient first achieve the creatinine based change specified in the definition (either > 0.3 mg/dl (> 26.5 μmol/l) within a 48-hour time window or an increase of ≥ 1.5 times baseline)", which "brings the definition and staging criteria to greater parity and simplifies the criteria".

### Adequate or not? A comparison of 24-hour urine studies for renal stone prevention by creatinine to weight ratio [^113FUKNG]. Journal of Endourology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

The intent of this study was to compare urine parameters between kidney stone formers with low, expected, and high creatinine to weight ratio (Cr/kg) and to discuss implications for treatment.

Patients and Methods

In this retrospective study, 381 stone formers (205 females and 176 males) with urine collections for nephrolithiasis evaluation were included. Using the first collected sample, patients were grouped into low, expected, and high Cr/kg using sex appropriate reference ranges (15.0–20.0 mg/kg for females and 18.0–24.0 mg/kg for males) and evaluated.

Results

Of initial collections, 50.7% were outside the Cr/kg reference range. Median age increased as Cr/kg decreased with 13 years age difference between low (56) and high (43) groups. Body mass index and weight also increased significantly with decreased ratio. No significant difference between groups was found for urine volume, total oxalate, oxalate concentration, pH, and supersaturations of calcium oxalate and uric acid. Total calcium, sodium, citrate, calcium concentration, supersaturation of calcium phosphate, and other parameters significantly increased with increased Cr/kg for the cohort.

Conclusions

To our knowledge, this is the first study to thoroughly evaluate the impact of Cr/kg on urine parameters. Clinicians should be cognizant of limitations of Cr/kg for evaluating collection adequacy. It is especially important to consider Cr/kg when there is potential for undertreatment or overtreatment of patients with abnormal Cr/kg. Studies demonstrating hypercalciuria and high Cr/kg may need to be repeated before starting thiazide diuretics. Further studies are needed to determine how to better interpret urine components that vary with Cr/kg ratio.

Measured GFR is "More expensive, more time-consuming, and invasive", with "Methods to measure that do not require urine collections are available (i.e., plasma clearance)" but "Most protocols require repeat blood samples potentially over a long duration", and although "Microsampling tests by fingerprick enable point-of-care testing. Testing has been described, but not routinely performed", measured GFR is "Accurate for GFR in all situations and across the GFR range. Requires individualized protocols", is "Able to identify early changes in GFR", and is "Less influenced by non-GFR determinants".

### A clinician's guide to monitoring kidney function in lithium-treated patients [^114zPDXe]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Bipolar disorder treatment guidelines recommend kidney-function monitoring at regular intervals for patients taking lithium, but they tend not to provide specifics with regard to what to measure and how to ensure that the results most accurately reflect true kidney function. This overview clarifies those practical aspects of monitoring that are often overlooked or misunderstood.

Data Sources

Utilized English language materials were obtained by PubMed searches (1970–2009), from the Lithium Information Center database, and from books. Search terms included lithium, kidney function, creatinine, creatinine clearance, GFR, GFR prediction equations, albuminuria, and urine concentration.

Data Synthesis

Urine osmolality most accurately reflects urine concentrating ability, although specific gravity is usually adequate for clinical purposes. Serum creatinine concentration can be influenced by extrarenal factors, but even when these are controlled, it remains a less than ideal measure of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Prediction equations are used commonly to estimate GFR and are an advance over serum creatinine alone, but even they are not as useful when GFR is only mildly impaired. Urine albumin measurement is important, but it requires greater standardization and sensitivity to maximize its potential.

Conclusions

The safe and effective use of lithium requires regular monitoring of kidney function. Doing so effectively requires knowledge of what to measure, how to ensure accurate results, and how to properly interpret them.

### Plasma creatinine assessment in creatine deficiency: a diagnostic pitfall [^111sXeEH]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2000). Low credibility.

Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency (creatine deficiency syndrome) is a recently discovered inborn error of creatine biosynthesis. Affected patients have elevated concentrations of guanidino-acetate, the metabolic precursor of creatine, in urine, plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. In addition, urinary creatinine excretion and plasma creatinine concentration are decreased. For biochemical evaluation of patients suspected to suffer from GAMT deficiency, correct quantification of creatinine in plasma is important. Here we report our experience with different quantification techniques. We found that creatinine in plasma from two GAMT-deficient patients appeared normal when measured by the Jaffé method but was decreased when measured enzymatically or by HPLC. The apparently normal levels of creatinine as measured by the Jaffé method were not caused by guanidinoacetate. In urine, the Jaffé method and the enzymatic method gave similar results, indicating that in urine no false elevations of creatinine can be expected. As the Jaffé method is still widely used for routine plasma creatinine measurements, it is important to realize it cannot be used to exclude GAMT deficiency.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 203: chronic hypertension in pregnancy [^1112Z7wi]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Baseline evaluation for chronic hypertension in pregnancy — initial testing before or at presentation is used to detect possible end-organ involvement, and if testing was not done before pregnancy, it should be performed at entry to prenatal care. Recommended baseline tests include serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, serum creatinine, serum electrolytes (specifically potassium), blood urea nitrogen, complete blood count, spot urine protein/creatinine ratio or 24-hour urine for total protein and creatinine (to calculate creatinine clearance) as appropriate, and electrocardiogram or echocardiogram as appropriate; uric acid is no longer a recommended routine baseline test. Because the kidneys are usually the first end-organ to be affected, baseline renal function assessment commonly includes serum creatinine, a spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, and, if needed, a 24-hour urinary collection for total protein and creatinine clearance; for patients with borderline or abnormal urine protein-to-creatinine ratios or serum creatinine values, a 24-hour urine collection is recommended. A spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of less than 0.15 safely indicates a level of proteinuria less than 300 mg for a 24-hour sample and, in the absence of an abnormality in serum creatinine, likely does not warrant further evaluation with a 24-hour urine collection, unless there is a need to assess creatinine clearance. Evidence includes a systematic review reporting protein-to-creatinine ratio cutoffs of 0.13–0.15 with sensitivities ranging from 90% to 99% to rule out significant proteinuria of 300 mg or more, and a meta-analysis with sensitivities of 86% (95% CI, 86–93%) for a cutoff of 0.13 and 88% (95% CI, 85–92%) for a cutoff of 0.15 to detect 300 mg or more of protein in a 24-hour urine sample. Assessment of creatinine clearance may be helpful in some cases; with mild renal impairment (serum creatinine between 0.9 mg/dL and 1.4 mg/dL), there is normal intravascular volume expansion and an incremental increase in creatinine clearance.

### Appropriate use of drug testing in clinical addiction medicine [^114oG7br]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Dilute urine samples — dilution is the most common cause of an invalid sample, and a combination of low creatinine (below 20 mg/dL) and specific gravity is used to indicate that a sample is dilute; in the case of dilute urine, the creatinine concentration of the sample can be used to normalize drug concentrations. Expert panel members commented that dilution is usually the result of deliberate water loading. For patients with a history of dilute urine samples, providers should advise the patient to decrease water intake prior to sample collection, collect samples first thing in the morning, collect samples before work or on days off if heavy hydration is required for occupation, and consider the use of an alternative matrix. There are some health conditions that can cause unusually high or low specific gravity and low creatinine, but a dilute urine sample from an underlying condition such as Diabetes Insipidus is very rare; providers should first advise appropriate hydration levels as a test for an underlying etiology of dilute samples.

As a general rule, high risk in-patients should have SCr measured at least daily and more frequently after an exposure, and critically ill patients should have urine output monitoring. This will necessitate urinary bladder catheterization in many cases, and the risks of infection should also be considered in the monitoring plan.

### Tubular secretion of creatinine and kidney function: an observational study [^113Qz7XM]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Although it has been known for many years that creatinine is cleared via both filtration and secretion, basic gaps remain in our knowledge regarding the physiology and pathophysiology of tubular secretion of creatinine in various states of health and disease. For example, exactly what fraction of creatinine is cleared via secretion vs. filtration? Is it possible that measurement error alone could entirely account for the longstanding observation that CrCl/GFR ratio is larger at lower GFR among patients with CKD? These questions are pertinent in the context of renewed recent interest in renal tubular function. Better understanding of tubular secretion as an independent marker of kidney function may provide insight into kidney disease pathophysiology and improve prediction of adverse outcomes. Others have emphasized that many drugs are cleared by tubular secretion, and drug-dose modification in CKD should not assume that renal excretory processes always decline in parallel with GFR as CKD progresses.

In this study we showed the following. First, we are able to replicate the results of our original CRIC cross-sectional results in MDRD and AASK. Replicating our initial findings in two other large research cohorts underscores the idea that certain studies in the literature may have been biased by measurement error, which has been under-appreciated in the past. (In fact, measurement error has not been mentioned at all in the prior literature as far as we can tell.)

Second (and closely related conceptually), we demonstrate that measurement error likely played an under-appreciated role also in prior literature that describes longitudinal changes in the CrCl/GFR ratio. For example, in the much cited study by Shemesh et al. the authors concluded from their longitudinal analysis that "The opposite changes in fractional creatinine secretion and GFR as glomerular disease deteriorates or improves serve to blunt the magnitude of change when creatinine is used to monitor progression of the glomerular injury". Not considered by the authors is the fact that measurement error alone may explain much of this observation.

### The urine protein / creatinine ratio as a reliable indicator of 24-h urine protein excretion across different levels of renal function and proteinuria: the TUNARI prospective study [^113dejX9]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The results of this study suggest that the PCR index is a practical alternative to 24-hUP measurement for identifying urinary protein in patients with nephropathies, regardless of their levels of renal function. We observed a high correlation, sensitivity and specificity, and excellent discrimination that support the use of PCR as a useful tool in the detection of urinary protein across a wide range of creatinine clearance, characterizing it as a simple and effective tool to follow the response to treatment. However, agreement between both methods is compromised at higher levels of proteinuria, requiring caution in evaluating depending on the clinical context. It is important to note that while PCR maintains good specificity and can effectively identify patients in the nephrotic range, caution is advised when interpreting PCR results from isolated urine samples. The clinical context should be carefully considered to ensure an accurate assessment.

### Urinary proteomics and metabolomics studies to monitor bladder health and urological diseases [^117X2c7a]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Despite all these shortcomings, urine is still an attractive source for studying bladder diseases. To monitor bladder condition, urine-based assays present the most attractive strategy, among other biofluids-based methods, given that the body fluids that are most proximal to a disease site often can provide a source of informative biomarkers. Urine is readily obtained and available with no required preparations by the patient and it is less complex than other body fluids. The ease of collection allows for serial sampling to monitor disease and therapeutic responses. Care must be taken in interpreting urine-based proteomics and metabolomics data. The main disadvantage of urine is the variation in protein concentration due to differences in fluid consumption during the day, which can be countered by normalizing with creatinine. However, although creatinine is the best possible internal standard for correcting urine volume effects, creatinine levels can vary due to dietary intake and pathological conditions. Computational approaches for data normalization methods can be applied to reduce artifacts due to sample variability using currently developed probabilistic quotient- and median-fold changes in normalization strategies.

Analytical techniques and databases for urine-based omics for bladder diseases

With the latest advances in high-throughput technologies, the pace of advances in the "omics" field accelerated the rate of novel biomarker discovery and therapeutic targets for various bladder diseases. Various omics technologies for personalized medicine are shown in Fig. 1, and ideal applications and workflow of urine-based biomarkers in clinical settings are shown in Fig. 2.

Potential clinical application using urine-based biomarkers

Proteomic technology has made a dramatic progress in the overall quality and information content over the past 5 years. When computationally matching identified proteins (or metabolites) against knowledge-based databases, proteomics or metabolomics profiles today provide direct insights for biological interpretation of molecular perturbations unique in patients with urological diseases. In this section, we review the current proteomic and metabolomic techniques and analytical tools/softwares that are used to identify signatures of urological diseases.

Results

1. Proposal for uniform standards for definition and classification of AKI

Definition and diagnostic criteria of AKI

For any condition, the clinician needs to know whether the disease is present and, if so, where and when the patient falls in the natural history of the disease. The former facilitates recognition whereas the latter defines time points for intervention. Unfortunately, there has been no uniformly accepted definition of AKI. Studies describe ARF or AKI based on serum creatinine changes, absolute levels of serum creatinine, changes in blood urea nitrogen or urine output, or the need for dialysis. The wide variation in definitions has made it difficult to compare information across studies and populations.

Diagnostic criteria

Recognition of AKI requires the delineation of easily measured criteria that can be widely applied. Serum creatinine levels and changes in urine output are the most commonly applied measures of renal function; however, they are each influenced by factors other than the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and do not provide any information about the nature or site of kidney injury. The proposed diagnostic criteria (Table 1) were based on consideration of the following concepts:

Table 1
Diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury

The above criteria include both an absolute and a percentage change in creatinine to accommodate variations related to age, gender, and body mass index and to reduce the need for a baseline creatinine but do require at least two creatinine values within 48 hours. The urine output criterion was included based on the predictive importance of this measure but with the awareness that urine outputs may not be measured routinely in non-intensive care unit settings. It is assumed that the diagnosis based on the urine output criterion alone will require exclusion of urinary tract obstructions that reduce urine output or of other easily reversible causes of reduced urine output. The above criteria should be used in the context of the clinical presentation and following adequate fluid resuscitation when applicable. Note: Many acute kidney diseases exist, and some (but not all) of them may result in acute kidney injury (AKI). Because diagnostic criteria are not documented, some cases of AKI may not be diagnosed. Furthermore, AKI may be superimposed on or lead to chronic kidney disease.

### The RIFLE and AKIN classifications for acute kidney injury: a critical and comprehensive review [^111m84zK]. Clinical Kidney Journal (2013). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "AKIN diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury" for acute kidney injury.

The AKIN (Acute Kidney Injury Network) classification for acute kidney injury is a diagnostic and severity grading system used in patients with suspected acute kidney injury (AKI). This calculator is applicable to all patient populations, including those in the intensive care unit, hospitalized patients, and outpatients.

The AKIN classification system is used to identify and stratify the severity of AKI based on changes in serum creatinine levels or urine output. It helps clinicians to determine the appropriate treatment strategies and predict patient outcomes.

The AKIN classification system is not suitable for patients with chronic kidney disease or those with pre-existing renal dysfunction, as the changes in serum creatinine levels or urine output may not accurately reflect the acute changes in kidney function in these patients.

The AKIN diagnostic criteria tool helps identify the severity of acute kidney injury (AKI) by evaluating changes in serum creatinine levels and urine output. The user starts by selecting one diagnostic criterion from a list of options, each reflecting different clinical measures.

These criteria include:

- Serum creatinine increase of at least 0.3 mg/dL (26.4 mcmol/L) or 1.5 to 2 times the baseline, with urine output less than 0.5 mL/kg/hour lasting over 6 hours.
- Serum creatinine increase of more than 2 to 3 times from baseline, combined with urine output less than 0.5 mL/kg/hour over a 12-hour period.
- Serum creatinine increase to or beyond 4 mg/dL (354 mcmol/L), with a rapid increment of at least 0.5 mg/dL (44 mcmol/L), or over 3 times the baseline value. This is associated with urine output below 0.3 mL/kg/hour for 24 hours, or complete lack of urine for 12 hours.

Using these criteria, the tool assigns an AKI stage:

- Stage 1 corresponds to the selection where serum creatinine increases are at least 0.3 mg/dL or 1.5–2 times above baseline paired with specified urine output reduction over 6 hours.
- Stage 2 signifies a creatinine increase of more than 2–3 times from baseline with decreased urine output extending past 12 hours.
- Stage 3 is indicated by the most severe changes in creatinine and urine output metrics, the latter showing significant reduction or lack of production over longer durations.

Each stage reflects increasing AKI severity, impacting clinical evaluation and management decisions. Recognizing the stage is critical for patient outcomes, steering appropriate interventions and monitoring.

This longitudinal cohort study included incident stages 3–5 CKD patients referred to the renal clinic at the University Federico II in Naples between January of 1995 and December of 2005. Clinical data and urine creatinine were updated at each visit. Main outcomes were all-cause mortality and kidney failure requiring dialysis.

Results

This study enrolled 525 individuals and followed them for a median of 6 years (range of 4 months to 15 years). Urine creatinine excretion declined by 16 mg/d per year (95% confidence interval, 14 to 19) in participants with CKD stages 3a, 3b, and 4, and it remained stable in participants with stage 5 CKD. Per each 20 mg/d decline in urine creatinine, mortality increased by 3% (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.01 to 1.05), and the risk of initiating dialysis increased by 2% (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.01 to 1.03). These associations were independent of body mass index and GFR.

Conclusions

In persons with CKD stages 3 and 4, urine creatinine declines at a rate of 16 mg/d per year. Lower urine creatinine excretion predicts greater risk of kidney failure and patient mortality.

### The Minnesota attributable risk of kidney donation (MARKD) study: a retrospective cohort study of long-term (> 50 year) outcomes after kidney donation compared to well-matched healthy controls [^113baQaE]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

For the primary analysis, we consider controls for whom we can ascertain BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, use of anti-hypertensive medications, smoking history, and known normal serum creatinine, normal blood urea nitrogen (particularly relevant in the 1960s where serum creatinine testing may not have been done), or normal urine protein (with no abnormal values for any of these 3 tests) identified within 10 years prior to the index date (minimize detection bias as we avoid any controls who may have had unrecognized kidney disease due to absence of kidney function testing). We additionally will attempt to include family history of CKD at the index date (either through chart review or from survey results) as a factor in the matching. Urine protein tests allowed are comprehensive (urine dipstick protein, 24 h urine protein, 24 h urine albumin, urine protein to creatinine ratio, urine protein to osmolality ratio, and urine albumin to creatinine ratio). However, we expect most will be urine dipstick proteins. Normal is defined using the reference range at the time of the test. Our preliminary data suggested that younger controls will often not have a baseline serum creatinine level, though about half will have a urine protein assessment. Since most kidney disease in younger adults is proteinuric, a normal urine protein test in younger adults (age < 50 years) will be considered sufficient for inclusion in this analysis.

Introduction

The causes of kidney injury are diverse, and the underlying mechanisms are complex. According to the cause of the disease, kidney injury can be divided into acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The global incidence of AKI in hospitalized patients ranges from 3.0% to 18.3%, however the incidence in hospitalized patients in China ranges from 6.9% to 11.6%. Currently, the clinical diagnosis of AKI is based on the standards set by "Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes" (KDIGO). Acute kidney injury is defined as follows: (1) an increase in serum creatinine (s-Crea) by 26.5 μmol/L (0.3 mg/dL) within 48 hours; or (2) an increase in s-Crea that is 1.5~2 times the baseline value within 7 days; or (3) urine output of < 0.5 mL kg –1 h –1 for more than 6 hours. Although the diagnostic window is advanced to 48 hours, changes in s-Crea levels are affected by body weight, age, sex, drugs, muscle content, and protein intake; furthermore, when the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is significantly reduced to below 50%, the s-Crea level begins to increase. In addition, urine output is easily affected by physiological reactions, pathological factors, and drugs, such as diuretics; therefore, the sensitivity and specificity of the KDIGO standard in diagnosing AKI are not high, and it is particularly important to find biomarkers for the early diagnosis of AKI.

B. Prognosis.

Albuminuria values > 30 mg/g creatinine [and lower values if the eGFR is < 60 mL/min (Table 8)] have prognostic significance. Multiple epidemiologic studies have shown it to be an independent risk marker for cardiovascular death. In 80% of patients with type 1 diabetes and low levels of albuminuria, urinary albumin excretion can increase by as much as 10%–20%/year, with the development of clinical proteinuria (> 300 mg albumin/day) in 10–15 years in more than half the patients. After clinical-grade proteinuria occurs, > 90% of patients develop a decreased GFR and, ultimately, end-stage renal disease. In type 2 diabetes, 20%–40% of patients with stage A2 albuminuria (Table 8) progress to overt nephropathy, but by 20 years after overt nephropathy, approximately 20% develop end-stage renal disease. In addition, patients with diabetes (type 1 or type 2) and stage A2 albuminuria are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Of note is that low levels of albuminuria alone indicate neither an increased risk for progression to end-stage kidney disease nor kidney disease per se; hypertension needs to be present for the risk of progression. Moreover, about 20% of people progress to end-stage kidney disease without an increase in low levels of albuminuria. Another factor that indicates progression is an increase in albuminuria from stage A2 to A3 over time despite achievement of blood pressure goals.

C. Monitoring.

The roles of routine urinalysis and albumin measurements are less clear in patients with stage A2 albuminuria. Some experts have advocated urine protein testing to monitor treatment, which may include improved glycemic control, more assiduous control of hypertension, dietary protein restriction, and therapy with blockers of the renin angiotensin system. Several factors are known to slow the rate of urinary albumin excretion or to prevent its development. They include reducing blood pressure (with a blocker of the renin angiotensin system as part of the regimen), glycemic control, and lipid-lowering therapy (,–).

Albumin excretion rate (AER) estimation — creatinine-based conversion and alternatives: The numeric evaluation of AER in mg/g (mg/mmol) to approximately g/d is based on the assumption that creatinine excretion rate (CER) approximates 1 gram/d (10 mmol/d). For individuals with creatinine generation very different from average, one might consider measuring a timed urine collection if the value would affect clinical decisions, using supervised urine collections, or use equations that estimate creatinine generation and multiply by ACR to compute an estimated AER that accommodates lower or higher CER.

### Measurement and estimation of GFR for use in clinical practice: core curriculum 2021 [^111NHckj]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Assessment of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is fundamental to clinical practice, public health, and research. The kidney has several critical functions; GFR is used as an overall assessment of these kidney functions. GFR is used to diagnose, stage, and manage chronic kidney disease (CKD); ascertain the prognosis for chronic kidney disease-related events and mortality; and determine drug dosages. GFR is the rate at which the glomerulus filters plasma to produce an ultrafiltrate and can be assessed from clearance or serum levels of filtration markers. Clearance measurements using exogenous filtration markers are difficult to perform in routine clinical practice, so GFR is more commonly estimated through equations based on serum concentrations of endogenous filtration markers, most commonly creatinine. These GFR estimates are reasonably accurate, but optimal care for patients may require a confirmatory test for a more accurate GFR assessment. Confirmatory tests currently available include cystatin C-based equations, urinary or plasma clearance of exogenous filtration markers, or urinary clearance of creatinine. Appreciation of the concept of GFR and methods for optimal assessment in routine practice or special circumstances, and their strengths and limitations, are critical in making judicious use of the available tools.

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) evaluation using initial and supportive tests begins with creatinine-based estimated GFR (eGFRcr) as the initial test; if eGFRcr is expected to be inaccurate or a more accurate assessment is needed for clinical decision-making, "cystatin C should be measured, and creatinine and cystatin C–based estimated GFR (eGFRcr-cys) should be estimated"; if eGFRcr-cys is expected to be inaccurate or an even more accurate assessment is needed, "measured GFR should be measured using plasma or urinary clearance of exogenous filtration markers". In otherwise healthy populations without changes in creatinine generation due to non-GFR determinants, "Initial test may be estimated GFR by cystatin C (eGFRcys or eGFRcr-cys)", and "Sources of error in eGFRcr-cys include very low muscle mass or very high levels of inflammation, high catabolic states, or exogenous steroid use", so "Consider eGFRcys rather than eGFRcr-cys in otherwise healthy populations with decreased creatinine generation due to reduced muscle mass or decreased creatinine secretion or external elimination due to the use of specific medications".

Point-of-care testing (POCT) for creatinine and urine albumin — We suggest that point-of-care testing (POCT) may be used for creatinine and urine albumin measurement where access to a laboratory is limited or providing a test at the point-of-care facilitates the clinical pathway (2C). Whenever a POCT device is used for creatinine and urine albumin testing, ensure that the same preanalytical, analytical, and postanalytical quality criteria relating to the specimen collection and performance of the device, including external quality assessment, and the interpretation of the result is used. Where creatinine POCT is used, generate an estimate of GFR and use the equation consistent with that used within the region. Where POCT is used for albuminuria testing, the capability of also analyzing creatinine and producing an ACR is important, and assess the ability of POCT ACR devices to produce a positive result in 85% of people with significant albuminuria (ACR ≥ 30 mg/g or ≥ 3 mg/ mmol) as part of device evaluation and consideration.

Clinical laboratory implementation standards — Implement the laboratory reporting and handling standards to ensure accuracy and reliability of urine samples, including: samples for albumin measurement analyzed fresh or stored at 4 °C for up to 7 days; samples for albumin measurement should not be stored frozen at −20 °C; report ACR in untimed urine samples in addition to urine albumin concentration rather than the concentrations alone; reporting to 1 decimal place for ACR whether mg/mmol or mg/g; and analytical CV of methods to measure urine albumin should be < 15%. Implementation of an external quality assessment scheme/program for urine albumin and creatinine, including calculation of the ACR, is a preferred practice for laboratories.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — Approach to glomerular filtration rate (GFR) evaluation uses an initial creatinine-based estimate with supportive testing when greater accuracy is needed. The initial test for the evaluation of GFR is creatinine-based estimated GFR (eGFRcr). If eGFRcr is expected to be inaccurate, or a more accurate assessment of GFR is needed for clinical decision-making, then, if available, cystatin C should be measured, and creatinine and cystatin C–based estimated GFR (eGFRcr-cys) should be estimated; if eGFRcr-cys is expected to be inaccurate, or if an even more accurate assessment is needed, then, if available, GFR should be measured using plasma or urinary clearance of exogenous filtration markers. Initial test may be estimated GFR by cystatin C (eGFRcys or eGFRcr-cys) in otherwise healthy populations with changes in creatinine generation due to non-GFR determinants, and sources of error in eGFRcr-cys include very low muscle mass, very high levels of inflammation, high catabolic states, or exogenous steroid use.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — Approach to glomerular filtration rate (GFR) evaluation using initial and supportive tests outlines a stepwise algorithm: the initial test for the evaluation of GFR is creatinine-based estimated GFR (eGFRcr); if eGFRcr is expected to be inaccurate or a more accurate assessment is needed for clinical decision-making, cystatin C should be measured and creatinine and cystatin C-based estimated GFR (eGFRcr-cys) should be estimated; if eGFRcr-cys is expected to be inaccurate or an even more accurate assessment is needed, measured GFR should be measured using plasma or urinary clearance of exogenous filtration markers. The flowchart directs users to consider sources of error and need for more accurate assessment and, based on the answer, to use eGFRcr or measure cystatin C, then to consider potential sources of error in eGFRcr-cys and decide whether to proceed with eGFRcr-cys or measure GFR. Additional notes specify that the initial test may be estimated GFR by cystatin C (eGFRcys or eGFRcr-cys) in otherwise healthy populations with non-GFR determinants affecting creatinine, list sources of error in eGFRcr-cys such as very low muscle mass, very high levels of inflammation, high catabolic states, or exogenous steroid use, and advise considering eGFRcys rather than eGFRcr-cys in otherwise healthy populations with decreased creatinine generation.

Evaluation of albuminuria — initial testing, confirmation, and interpretation: Use the following measurements for initial testing of albuminuria (in descending order of preference), and in all cases, a first void in the morning midstream urine sample is preferred. If measuring urine protein, use urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR), reagent strip urinalysis for total protein with automated reading, or reagent strip urinalysis for total protein with manual reading. Use more accurate methods when albuminuria is detected using less accurate methods, confirm reagent strip positive albuminuria and/or proteinuria by quantitative laboratory measurement and express as a ratio to urine creatinine wherever possible, and confirm ACR ≥ 30 mg/g (≥ 3 mg/mmol) on a random untimed urine with a subsequent first morning void in the morning midstream urine sample. Understand factors that may affect interpretation of measurements of urine albumin and urine creatinine and order confirmatory tests as indicated.
