## Question

A 38-year-old woman presents with fluctuating ptosis, diplopia, and generalized muscle weakness that worsens with activity and improves with rest. She was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis two months ago and started on pyridostigmine, which was titrated to the maximum tolerated dose. Despite this, she continues to experience significant symptoms that interfere with her daily activities. Antibody testing reveals positivity for muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibodies.

Based on current expert guidelines, what is the next step in management for this patient, and what should you consider regarding her likely response to therapy?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the next step in management for a 38-year-old woman with generalized MuSK-antibody positive myasthenia gravis who remains symptomatic despite maximally tolerated pyridostigmine, and what to expect regarding treatment response. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and antibody phenotype. Then, I should verify why pyridostigmine failed and whether that aligns with MuSK biology. Next, I will review guideline-based escalation pathways, including corticosteroids, steroid-sparing agents, and rituximab. After that, I need to check the role of thymectomy and acute rescue therapies. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, prioritized plan and counsel on prognosis and monitoring, making sure each step is supported by consensus guidance and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and phenotype. Fluctuating ptosis, diplopia, and generalized weakness with fatigability are classic for myasthenia gravis, and MuSK antibodies define a distinct subgroup comprising roughly 5–8% of MG, with a predilection for bulbar, facial, neck, and respiratory muscles and a higher risk of myasthenic crisis, which fits this presentation and explains the limited benefit from acetylcholinesterase inhibition [^116iNGzG] [^116STSzZ] [^116KBKzR].

> Wait, let me verify why pyridostigmine failed. MuSK-MG is mechanistically different from AChR-MG; MuSK antibodies are predominantly IgG4 and disrupt agrin–MuSK–LRP4 clustering at the neuromuscular junction, reducing AChR density and synaptic integrity, which makes cholinesterase inhibition less effective and often poorly tolerated at conventional doses, so a poor response to pyridostigmine is expected in this subgroup [^116KBKzR] [^116pggVW] [^114hCECP].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm the guideline-based next step. Multiple international consensus statements converge on the same message: if a patient with MG fails to meet treatment goals after an adequate pyridostigmine trial, initiate immunosuppression, and in MuSK-MG specifically, rituximab should be considered early given its favorable signal and the limited utility of cholinesterase inhibitors in this phenotype [^117B6Wvh] [^116ZfDGS] [^114fpU12] [^117JJFMa].

> I will now examine first-line immunosuppression. Oral corticosteroids are the conventional starting point for generalized MG not controlled on symptomatic therapy, and MuSK-MG patients often respond well to steroids, though many remain steroid dependent and require careful tapering with close monitoring for relapses during dose reductions [^113ssjRj] [^113ssjRj].

> Next, I should review steroid-sparing options. Azathioprine is the most evidence-supported nonsteroidal immunosuppressant in MG and is commonly paired with corticosteroids to facilitate tapering, while mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, and calcineurin inhibitors are reasonable alternatives when azathioprine is not tolerated or is ineffective, acknowledging that head-to-head comparative RCTs are limited and practice varies internationally [^113ssjRj] [^111u3qov].

> But wait, what if we want to optimize early disease control in MuSK-MG specifically. Rituximab has repeatedly shown strong real-world and prospective signals in MuSK-MG, with higher rates of minimal manifestation status and steroid-sparing effects compared with AChR-MG, and the 2020 MGFA update explicitly recommends considering rituximab as an early option in MuSK-MG with unsatisfactory response to initial immunotherapy, supported by prospective data and systematic reviews [^1166yaG7] [^117JJFMa] [^114fpU12].

> Let me consider thymectomy, because I need to ensure I don't overextend its indications. Thymectomy is not recommended in MuSK-MG; the thymus is typically normal or only mildly abnormal in this subgroup, and there is no consistent evidence of benefit, so thymectomy should be avoided here unless there is a separate oncologic indication such as thymoma, which would change management entirely [^116DrWH5] [^111Z81Fy] [^113V1xVh].

> I should double-check acute rescue strategies for exacerbations or crisis. Plasma exchange is generally more effective than IVIG in MuSK-MG, and both are appropriate short-term therapies for severe bulbar or respiratory involvement or when a rapid response is needed; in myasthenic crisis, early plasma exchange or IVIG plus corticosteroids is standard, with close respiratory monitoring and ICU-level care as indicated [^112G94sK] [^113Gcz43] [^111B9ETw].

> Next, I should review emerging therapies to contextualize future options. Complement inhibitors such as eculizumab and FcRn blockers like efgartigimod and nipocalimab are FDA-approved for AChR-positive gMG and have expanding roles; while MuSK-MG was underrepresented in pivotal trials, real-world and trial subsets suggest benefit in MuSK-MG as well, and updated algorithms increasingly include these agents for refractory disease or when steroid toxicity limits options, though access and cost remain barriers [^1163Ftyp] [^112VzgB2].

> Let me synthesize a practical, prioritized plan. Given persistent symptoms despite maximally tolerated pyridostigmine in MuSK-MG, I would initiate oral prednisone, typically starting around 1 mg/kg/day with a plan to taper once control is achieved, and concurrently begin a steroid-sparing agent such as azathioprine, with upfront counseling on adverse effects and monitoring needs. Alternatively, given the MuSK phenotype, I would discuss early rituximab as a reasonable first-line immunotherapy to reduce steroid exposure, especially if rapid steroid sparing is desired or if steroid side effects emerge, aligning with consensus guidance and prospective MuSK-focused data [^117B6Wvh] [^114fpU12] [^1166yaG7].

> I need to ensure I address prognosis and monitoring. MuSK-MG often has a more aggressive course early but can achieve good long-term outcomes with appropriate immunotherapy; many patients require prolonged immunosuppression and some remain steroid dependent, so I should set expectations, schedule regular MG-ADL and QMG assessments, and monitor for relapse during steroid tapers, adjusting therapy accordingly [^114hCECP] [^1147gcXY] [^116rczeH].

> Hold on, I should verify safety pearls and follow-up. Educate on infection risk with immunosuppression, implement vaccination strategies when feasible, and coordinate care for women of childbearing potential given teratogenicity of some agents; maintain vigilance for respiratory compromise given the higher crisis risk in MuSK-MG, and consider a written action plan for exacerbations [^116iNGzG] [^112ArZmf].

> In summary, the next step is to escalate to immunosuppression, with corticosteroids plus a steroid-sparing agent as standard, and to consider rituximab early in MuSK-MG given its favorable efficacy signal and guideline endorsement. Thymectomy is not indicated, and pyridostigmine should be continued only if it provides meaningful symptomatic benefit without adverse effects, recognizing its limited role in this subgroup [^117B6Wvh] [^114fpU12] [^116DrWH5] [^114hCECP].

---

The next step is to **initiate immunosuppressive therapy** with corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone) because MuSK MG often responds poorly to pyridostigmine and requires early immunosuppression [^117B6Wvh] [^114hCECP]. If steroids are inadequate or not tolerated, add a steroid-sparing agent such as azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil [^113ssjRj]. Rituximab should be considered early for refractory MuSK MG given strong evidence of benefit [^114fpU12] [^1166yaG7]. Thymectomy is not recommended for MuSK MG [^116DrWH5] [^111Z81Fy]. For acute worsening or crisis, use plasma exchange or IVIG, noting plasma exchange may be more effective in MuSK MG [^112G94sK] [^113Gcz43].

## Clinical features and pathophysiology of MuSK MG

MuSK MG is characterized by:

- **Predominant bulbar involvement**: Marked facial, jaw, and tongue weakness with atrophy, leading to dysphagia, dysarthria, and chewing difficulties [^116STSzZ] [^116KBKzR].

- **Respiratory muscle involvement**: Frequent respiratory crises and ventilatory support needs [^116STSzZ] [^117P2GmN].

- **Pathophysiology**: MuSK antibodies are predominantly IgG4, disrupting neuromuscular junction clustering and acetylcholine receptor density, explaining poor response to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors [^116KBKzR] [^116pggVW].

---

## Limitations of pyridostigmine in MuSK MG

Pyridostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, increases acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction but is often ineffective in MuSK MG because MuSK antibodies disrupt synaptic structure and function rather than simply blocking receptors [^116KBKzR]. Studies show that up to 71% of MuSK MG patients have minimal or no response to pyridostigmine, and higher doses can cause muscarinic side effects without benefit [^117P2GmN] [^114hCECP].

---

## Recommended next step: immunosuppressive therapy

Given the limited efficacy of pyridostigmine in MuSK MG, **immunosuppressive therapy is recommended** [^117B6Wvh]. Corticosteroids are first-line, with steroid-sparing agents added as needed [^113ssjRj].

---

### Corticosteroids

Corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone) are **first-line immunosuppressive therapy** for MuSK MG [^117B6Wvh]. They reduce autoantibody production and inflammation, improving muscle strength and function [^115FS7TN]. Many patients require long-term maintenance therapy due to frequent relapses during tapering [^115FS7TN].

---

### Steroid-sparing agents

Steroid-sparing agents are added when corticosteroids alone are insufficient or cause significant side effects [^113ssjRj]. Commonly used agents include:

| **Medication** | **Mechanism of action** | **Clinical evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| Azathioprine | Inhibits purine synthesis, reducing lymphocyte proliferation | Supported by RCTs and guidelines as first-line steroid-sparing agent [^113ssjRj] [^117P6iry] |
| Mycophenolate mofetil | Inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, reducing B and T cell proliferation | Widely used despite limited RCT data; supported by guidelines [^113ssjRj] |
| Methotrexate | Folate antagonist inhibiting DNA synthesis | Limited RCT data; may be considered when other agents are not tolerated [^111u3qov] |
| Rituximab | Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody depleting B cells | Strong evidence in MuSK MG; consider early in refractory cases [^114fpU12] [^1166yaG7] |

---

## Role of rituximab in MuSK MG

Rituximab, a B-cell depleting monoclonal antibody, has **emerged as an effective early therapy** for MuSK MG [^114fpU12]. Prospective and retrospective studies show high rates of clinical improvement, steroid sparing, and sustained remission in MuSK MG [^1166yaG7]. The 2020 international consensus recommends rituximab as an early option in MuSK MG with unsatisfactory response to initial immunotherapy [^117JJFMa].

---

## Thymectomy considerations

Thymectomy is **not recommended** for MuSK MG because the thymus is typically normal or only mildly abnormal, and thymectomy does not improve outcomes in this subgroup [^116DrWH5] [^113V1xVh]. It is reserved for thymoma-associated MG or AChR antibody-positive MG [^116DrWH5].

---

## Acute exacerbations and myasthenic crisis management

During acute exacerbations or myasthenic crisis, **plasma exchange (PLEX) or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)** are used to rapidly reduce antibody load and improve symptoms [^111B9ETw]. PLEX may be more effective than IVIG in MuSK MG, though both are acceptable options [^112G94sK] [^113Gcz43].

---

## Prognosis and long-term management

MuSK MG often has a more aggressive course early but can achieve good long-term control with appropriate immunotherapy [^1147gcXY]. Many patients require prolonged immunosuppression, and relapses are common during steroid tapering [^115FS7TN]. Regular monitoring and individualized treatment adjustments are essential [^116aTLkH].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Initiate corticosteroids**: Start prednisone as first-line immunosuppressive therapy [^117B6Wvh].

- **Add steroid-sparing agent**: Consider azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil if steroids are inadequate or not tolerated [^113ssjRj].

- **Consider rituximab early**: Especially in refractory or relapsing MuSK MG [^114fpU12] [^1166yaG7].

- **Avoid thymectomy**: Not recommended in MuSK MG [^116DrWH5] [^111Z81Fy].

- **Use PLEX or IVIG**: For acute exacerbations or myasthenic crisis, with PLEX preferred in MuSK MG [^112G94sK] [^113Gcz43].

---

The next step for a 38-year-old woman with MuSK MG who remains symptomatic despite maximally tolerated pyridostigmine is to **initiate immunosuppressive therapy with corticosteroids**, adding a steroid-sparing agent if needed, and considering rituximab early for refractory disease. Thymectomy is not recommended, and PLEX or IVIG should be used for acute exacerbations.

Juvenile MG (see also Thymectomy in MG, no. 2).

1. Children with acquired autoimmune ocular MG are more likely than adults to go into spontaneous remission. Thus, young children with only ocular symptoms of MG can be treated initially with pyridostigmine. Immunotherapy can be initiated if goals of therapy are not met.
2. Children are at particular risk of steroid side effects, including growth failure, poor bone mineralization, and susceptibility to infection, due in part to a delay in live vaccinations. Long-term treatment with corticosteroids should use the lowest effective dose to minimize side effects.

New treatments on the horizon

Traditionally, patients with myasthenia gravis have been treated with pyridostigmine, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants (eg, azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil), and intravenous immunoglobulins or plasmapheresis during episodes of myasthenia gravis crisis or severe myasthenia gravis symptoms. These treatments are the foundation of myasthenia gravis treatment and the backbone of the 2020 international consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis and the Association of British Neurologists' guidelines on myasthenia gravis. The international consensus guidance recommends early consideration of thymectomy in patients with AChR antibody positive generalised myasthenia gravis (AChR+gMG), aged 18–50 years, although the guideline from the Association of British Neurologists emphasises early thymectomy in patients with general and ocular myasthenia gravis who are younger than 45 years. Despite these treatments, 8.5–15% of individuals with myasthenia gravis continue to have symptoms that negatively affect their quality of life or have unwanted adverse effects related to the treatments. Our understanding of the pathophysiology of myasthenia gravis has enabled the development of new targeted therapeutics with more favourable side effect profiles. Possibly future treatment algorithms might not resemble our current approach (table 1).

B cell depletion treatments

Treatments targeted at B cell depletion have received substantial attention because autoreactive B cells have important an role in the immunopathogenesis of myasthenia gravis by producing pathogenic autoantibodies. Rituximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody against CD20 that depletes circulating B cells. Several retrospective and prospective studies of rituximab in AChR+gMG and MuSK antibody positive generalised myasthenia gravis (MuSK+gMG) have recently been published, focusing on new onset disease, refractory disease, or both. In a retrospective cohort study of 72 non-MuSk+gMG patients with either new onset or refractory disease treated with rituximab, 55 of 72 patients fulfilled the criteria for clinical remission. Time to remission was shorter in those with new onset generalised myasthenia gravis compared with those with refractory disease (7 v 16 months, P = 0.009). The new onset group treated with rituximab achieved clinical remission at a faster rate than the control group receiving conventional treatment (7 v 11 months, P = 0.004).

### Myasthenia gravis: subgroup classification and therapeutic strategies [^116Whhje]. The Lancet: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease that is characterised by muscle weakness and fatigue, is B-cell mediated, and is associated with antibodies directed against the acetylcholine receptor, muscle-specific kinase (MUSK), lipoprotein-related protein 4 (LRP4), or agrin in the postsynaptic membrane at the neuromuscular junction. Patients with myasthenia gravis should be classified into subgroups to help with therapeutic decisions and prognosis. Subgroups based on serum antibodies and clinical features include early-onset, late-onset, thymoma, MUSK, LRP4, antibody-negative, and ocular forms of myasthenia gravis. Agrin-associated myasthenia gravis might emerge as a new entity. The prognosis is good with optimum symptomatic, immunosuppressive, and supportive treatment. Pyridostigmine is the preferred symptomatic treatment, and for patients who do not adequately respond to symptomatic therapy, corticosteroids, azathioprine, and thymectomy are first-line immunosuppressive treatments. Additional immunomodulatory drugs are emerging, but therapeutic decisions are hampered by the scarcity of controlled studies. Long-term drug treatment is essential for most patients and must be tailored to the particular form of myasthenia gravis.

Fig. 4
Treatment algorithm for gMG with AChR or MuSK antibodies. After clinical, laboratory (and radiological) diagnosis of gMG, start symptomatic therapy (pyridostigmine). In AChR-antibody positive cases under the age of 65, and all MG patients with thymoma, thymectomy should be considered. Oral steroids (aim for no more than 20 mg prednisolone/day induction dose), other oral agents (e.g. azathioprine/mycophenolate mofetil/ciclosporin/methotrexate), or anti-CD20 can be started if insufficient response to symptomatic medications or while waiting for a thymectomy procedure and subsequent response, which may take up to two years for full therapeutic effect. If severe side effects or an inadequate response to this stepped approach at 10–12 months, consideration should be given to adding in a new targeted therapy such as a complement inhibitor (AChR-Ab patients) or FcRN-inhibition (AChR and MuSK-Ab patients). IVIG and PLEX are not chronic therapies and their use is advised for rescue therapy at disease onset or in MG crisis, and, for some patients pre-surgically. The updated German guidelines propose a comparable approach.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: executive summary [^115vXcS7]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Acquired myasthenia gravis (MG) is a disorder of neuromuscular transmission, resulting from binding of autoantibodies to components of the neuromuscular junction, most commonly the acetylcholine receptor (AChR). The incidence ranges from 0.3 to 2.8 per 100,000, and it is estimated to affect more than 700,000 people worldwide.

The increasing use of immunomodulating therapies has been a major factor in improving the prognosis for patients with MG in recent years. The various treatment options must be weighed in the context of individual patient factors.

Discussion

This is an updated formal international consensus guidance of MG experts, based on new evidence that has become available since the initial guidance was published in 2016. As before, these statements are intended as a guide for clinicians worldwide and are not absolute recommendations for management. They are also not intended for establishing payment policies or drug tiering by payers. This continues to be a living document, which will require periodic review and updates to reflect new information relevant to the management of MG.

Thymectomy in MG.

1. In non-thymomatous MG, thymectomy is performed as an option to potentially avoid or minimize the dose or duration of immunotherapy, or if patients fail to respond to an initial trial of immunotherapy or have intolerable side-effects from that therapy. Because of the long delay in onset of effect, thymectomy for MG is an elective procedure. It should be performed when the patient is stable and deemed safe to undergo a procedure where postoperative pain and mechanical factors can limit respiratory function.
2. The value of thymectomy in the treatment of prepubertal patients with MG is unclear, but thymectomy should be considered in children with generalized AChR antibody–positive MG: a. If the response to pyridostigmine and IS therapy is unsatisfactory; or b. In order to avoid potential complications of IS therapy.

For children diagnosed with seronegative generalized MG, the possibility of a congenital myasthenic syndrome or other neuromuscular condition should be entertained, and evaluation at a center specializing in neuromuscular diseases is of value prior to thymectomy.
3. With rare exceptions, all patients with MG with thymoma should undergo surgery to remove the tumor. Removal of the thymoma is performed to rid the patient of the tumor and may not produce improvement in MG. All thymus tissue should be removed along with the tumor. Further treatment of thymoma will be dictated by histologic classification and degree of surgical excision. Incompletely resected thymomas should be managed after surgery with an interdisciplinary treatment approach (radiotherapy, chemotherapy).
4. In elderly or multimorbid patients with thymoma, palliative radiation therapy can be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. Small thymomas may be followed without treatment unless they are enlarging or become symptomatic.
5. Endoscopic and robotic approaches to thymectomy are increasingly performed and have a good track record for safety in experienced centers. Data from randomized, controlled comparison studies are not available. Based on comparisons across studies, less invasive thymectomy approaches appear to yield similar results to more aggressive approaches.
6. Thymectomy may be considered in patients with generalized MG without detectable AChR antibodies if they fail to respond adequately to IS therapy, or to avoid/minimize intolerable adverse effects from IS therapy. Current evidence does not support an indication for thymectomy in patients with MuSK, LRP4, or agrin antibodies.

Development of guidance treatment statements.

The following were agreed upon a priori:

1. Treatment costs and availability would not be considered, as it is not possible to make international consensus statements specific for all countries.
2. Clinical examination is assumed to have been performed by physicians skilled in the evaluation of neuromuscular disease.
3. The MGFA Clinical Classification, including remission, refers to the state of the patient at the time of evaluation.

A formal systematic review of the literature was not performed. The Task Force co-chairs and facilitator drafted initial guidance statements based on literature cited in recent national and regional MG treatment guidelines, supplemented by other literature.

Guidance statements were developed for the following:

1. Symptomatic and immunosuppressive (IS) treatments
2. IV immunoglobulin (IVIg) and plasma exchange (PLEX)
3. Impending and manifest myasthenic crisis
4. Thymectomy
5. Juvenile MG (JMG)
6. MG with antibodies to muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK-MG)
7. MG in pregnancy

This review focuses on the diagnostic tests that may help to confirm myasthenia in patients without acetylcholine receptor antibodies, including the newly discovered anti-muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase antibody and other investigations. We discuss management dilemmas, particularly those that revolve around treatments whose efficacy is questionable or unproved, such as thymectomy. We review the important issue of how treatments are assessed, and examine future treatment trial designs.

Recommendations

a. In nonthymomatous, generalized MG patients with AChR-Ab, aged 18–50 years, thymectomy should be considered early in the disease to improve clinical outcomes and to minimize immunotherapy requirements and the need for hospitalizations for disease exacerbations (median 9, range 2–9). b. Thymectomy should be strongly considered in patients with AChR-Ab+ generalized MG if they fail to respond to an initial adequate trial of immunotherapy or have intolerable side effects from that therapy (median 9, range 5–9).
Thymectomy for MG is an elective procedure and should be performed when the patient is stable and deemed safe to undergo a procedure where postoperative pain and mechanical factors can limit respiratory function (median 9, range 8–9).

Recommendations 4 and 5 below are unchanged from the 2016 consensus guidance.
Endoscopic and robotic approaches to thymectomy are increasingly performed and have a good track record for safety in experienced centers. Data from randomized, controlled comparison studies are not available. Based on comparisons across studies, less invasive thymectomy approaches appear to yield similar results to more aggressive approaches (median 9, range 4–9).
Thymectomy may be considered in patients with generalized MG without detectable AChR-Ab if they fail to respond adequately to immunosuppressive (IS) therapy or to avoid/minimize intolerable adverse effects from IS therapy. Current evidence does not support an indication for thymectomy in patients with MuSK, low-density lipoprotein receptor–related protein 4, or agrin antibodies (median 9, range 6–9) (table e-3).

Why do we need MG guidance treatment statements?

Although there is widespread agreement on the use of many treatments for MG, there is no internationally accepted standard of care. Because MG is heterogeneous, no one treatment approach is best for all patients. Few physicians treat enough patients with MG to be comfortable with all available treatments. Given its heterogeneity, the few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in MG have limited generalizability, while uncontrolled trials are limited by potential bias. Hence, an effort to develop consensus among international experts was undertaken to guide clinicians worldwide on the multifaceted approach to managing MG. This summary condenses the extensive background information in the full guidance statements, available on the Neurology ® Web site at.

Symptomatic and IS treatment of MG.

1. Pyridostigmine should be part of the initial treatment in most patients with MG. Pyridostigmine dose should be adjusted as needed based on symptoms. The ability to discontinue pyridostigmine can be an indicator that the patient has met treatment goals and may guide the tapering of other therapies. Corticosteroids or IS therapy should be used in all patients with MG who have not met treatment goals after an adequate trial of pyridostigmine.
2. A nonsteroidal IS agent should be used alone when corticosteroids are contraindicated or refused. A nonsteroidal IS agent should be used initially in conjunction with corticosteroids when the risk of steroid side effects is high based on medical comorbidities. A nonsteroidal IS agent should be added to corticosteroids when: a. Steroid side effects, deemed significant by the patient or the treating physician, develop; b. Response to an adequate trial (table e-1) of corticosteroids is inadequate; or c. The corticosteroid dose cannot be reduced due to symptom relapse.
3. Nonsteroidal IS agents that can be used in MG include azathioprine, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, and tacrolimus. The following factors should be considered in selecting among these agents: a. There is widespread variation in practice with respect to choice of IS agent since there is little literature comparing them. b. Expert consensus and some RCT evidence support the use of azathioprine as a first-line IS agent in MG. c. Evidence from RCTs supports the use of cyclosporine in MG, but potential serious adverse effects and drug interactions limit its use. d. Although available RCT evidence does not support the use of mycophenolate and tacrolimus in MG, both are widely used, and one or both are recommended in several national MG treatment guidelines.
4. Patients with refractory MG should be referred to a physician or a center with expertise in management of MG. In addition to the previously mentioned IS agents, the following therapies may also be used in refractory MG: a. Chronic IVIg and chronic PLEX (see IVIg and PLEX, no. 6); b. Cyclophosphamide; c. Rituximab, for which evidence of efficacy is building, but for which formal consensus could not be reached.
5. IS agent dosage and duration of treatment a. Once patients achieve treatment goals, the corticosteroid dose should be gradually tapered. In many patients, continuing a low dose of corticosteroids long-term can help to maintain the treatment goal. b. For nonsteroidal IS agents, once treatment goals have been achieved and maintained for 6 months to 2 years, the IS dose should be tapered slowly to the minimal effective amount. Dosage adjustments should be made no more frequently than every 3–6 months (table e-1). c. Tapering of IS drugs is associated with risk of relapse, which may necessitate upward adjustments in dose. The risk of relapse is higher in patients who are symptomatic, or after rapid taper. d. It is usually necessary to maintain some immunosuppression for many years, sometimes for life.
6. Patients must be monitored for potential adverse effects and complications from IS drugs. Changing to an alternative IS agent should be considered if adverse effects and complications are medically significant or create undue hardship for the patient.

Regarding specific circumstances for myasthenia gravis, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, MGFA 2016 guidelines recommend to recognize that pediatric patients with acquired autoimmune ocular MG are more likely than adult patients to go into spontaneous remission. Consider administering pyridostigmine as initial therapy in young pediatric patients with only ocular symptoms of MG. Consider initiating immunotherapy if goals of therapy are not met.

### New and emerging treatments for myasthenia gravis [^112VzgB2]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Future treatment landscape

Treatment for myasthenia gravis is rapidly evolving, with particularly notable developments for patients with moderate to severe AChR+gMG. Considering the drugs recently approved by the FDA and new treatments on the horizon, selection of the ideal therapeutic might seem daunting. Although drawing comparisons in efficacy across different clinical trials is tempting, especially when the same primary and secondary endpoints are used, caution is recommended. Differences in baseline patient characteristics, including antibody status, severity of disease, concomitant drugs on entry to the trial, previously attempted drug treatments, and duration of time since thymectomy are likely to mean that the results are not directly comparable.

Ultimately, incorporation of newer therapeutics will require comprehensive assessment of costs versus benefits, potential risks, patient preference, and medical comorbidities. Considering the high costs of these newer treatments, whether they will replace the traditional first line treatment approach remains to be seen. The long term efficacy, safety, and tolerability of these treatments have yet to be determined but use of these newer therapeutics and traditional treatments might not need to be mutually exclusive. We might ultimately find that a combined approach, targeting different pathomechanisms of the disease simultaneously, will lead to improved outcomes. Complement inhibitors, especially eculizumab, have been used increasingly in the clinical management of patients with refractory AChR+gMG since its approval; efgartigimod alfa is getting lots of attention for its new mechanism and safety profile; and rituximab is now considered an effective early intervention in MuSK+MG by many specialists, and its use in the management of patients with refractory AChR+MG is also increasing. The guidelines that direct the clinical care of our patients with myasthenia gravis will need to be updated frequently to reflect the rapidly changing tools available to treat these patients.

### Myasthenia gravis: a clinical-immunological update [^112V3Bqx]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

The therapeutic landscape

Pyridostigmine and corticosteroids retain a central role in the management of GMG. Use of azathioprine as a steroid-sparing agent is supported by an RCT but limited high quality evidence underlies many other immunosuppressants. However, recently, a single-blinded trial proposed methotrexate as an alternative to azathioprine. While this trial was devised to validate methotrexate in a resource-limited setting, it may have applicability for azathioprine-intolerant individuals.

MuSK MG patients have traditionally represented a clinical challenge as they exhibit poor response to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, is emerging as a potential option in this cohort. Following rituximab treatment, some patients even revert to a seronegative status. Of particular interest, specific monitoring of IgG sub-classes in five clinically improved rituximab-treated MuSK MG individuals demonstrated significantly reduced IgG4 titres in all five. On the other hand, both clinical and serologic impact was much less favourable in AChR antibody patients treated in the same study. Indeed, rituximab appears to be a useful treatment in other IgG4-related diseases and to act by eliminating a population of B- or plasma cells responsible for the production of IgG4 antibodies. Rituximab's effect on T cell response may also be relevant, and an increase in T-regulatory cells has been observed post-rituximab administration in a refractory MuSK, but not AChR-positive, patient. Further work is required to determine the optimal timing and administration schedule of rituximab in MG.

Another monoclonal antibody being considered for MG is eculizumab, which targets the C5 protein of the complement cascade, and so might protect the NMJ from complement-mediated damage. In a small phase II trial, there was significant change on the quantitative myasthenia gravis score (QMGS) with eculizumab compared to placebo. A phase III trial is now in progress, aiming to enrol 92 patients. The weekly dosing schedule and high cost of this medication may limit its use.

Early stage agents in development include EN101/Monarsen, an antisense oligonucleotide to mRNA of a splicing variant of acetylcholinesterase which is elevated in mice with experimental autoimmune MG and in patients. It is currently unclear whether clinical effect is due to inhibition of the splicing variant, producing symptomatic relief, or anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory actions via the NF-κB pathway. Another drug in phase II studies is Tirasemtiv, which enhances skeletal muscle's response to calcium and may be of benefit in combination with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.

### Clinical evaluation and management of myasthenia gravis [^115tAk4x]. Muscle & Nerve (2004). Low credibility.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a syndrome of fluctuating skeletal muscle weakness that worsens with use and improves with rest. Eye, facial, oropharyngeal, axial, and limb muscles may be involved in varying combinations and degrees of severity. Its etiology is heterogeneous, divided initially between those rare congenital myasthenic syndromes, which are genetic, and the bulk of MG, which is acquired and autoimmune. The autoimmune conditions are divided in turn between those that possess measurable serum acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies and a smaller group that does not. The latter group includes those MG patients who have serum antibodies to muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK). Therapeutic considerations differ for early-onset MG, late-onset MG, and MG associated with the presence of a thymoma. Most MG patients can be treated effectively, but there is still a need for more specific immunological approaches.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: 2020 update [^117JJFMa]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Three cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy have been reported in MG. One was RTX related, although the patient had previously received other IS agents, another patient was on azathioprine and prednisone, and the third patient was on prednisolone, IVIg, and azathioprine.

Recommendations

Recommendation 1 is unchanged from the 2016 consensus guidance.
Rituximab should be considered as an early therapeutic option in patients with MuSK-Ab+ MG who have an unsatisfactory response to initial immunotherapy (median 9, range 4–9).
The efficacy of RTX in refractory AChR-Ab+ MG is uncertain. It is an option if patients fail or do not tolerate other IS agents (median 8, range 4–9) (tables e-2 and e-7).

### Treating myasthenia gravis beyond the eye clinic [^115S8G7q]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Thymectomy

In all MG patients who have a thymoma or those who are AChR antibody positive, therapeutic thymectomy is recommended. The beneficial effect of thymectomy in older patients and antibody negative MG is not fully established, and it is generally recommended in onset of disease less than 50 years of age. Practically however, it is often used until the age of 65 if the patients are otherwise fit and healthy. Thymectomy is not recommended in MuSK-MG since there are no consistent thymic abnormalities in this sub-group.

### MuSK-antibodies are associated with worse outcome in myasthenic crisis requiring mechanical ventilation [^117P2GmN]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Focusing on the therapeutic management, a similar number of patients in both groups received intravenous pyridostigmine. MuSK-ABs belong to IgG4-subclass, which may reduce the density of acetylcholine receptors as well as postsynaptic acetylcholine sensitivity. Consequently, the effect of pyridostigmine in patients with MuSK-MG can be questioned. Other clinical studies reported a non-responsiveness of pyridostigmine in MuSK-MG of up to 71%. Thus, outcome in MC might also be unfavorably influenced by a reduced effect of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors specifically in MuSK-MG.

In MC, the inclusion of immunomodulatory therapies is unavoidable. Comparing our subgroups, physicians more frequently decided for a therapy with PE/IA in MuSK-MCs, whereas a higher number of AChR-MCs received IVIGs. This might be explained by individual treatment pathways in our participating centers, availability of treatment options, and due to its preferred listing in the German MG guidelines. Another explanation is that MuSK-AB status was known in 15 of 19 crises before treatment initiation, which could have led to a precautious treatment escalation in these patients. Our results showed that an early use of PE/IA reduced the days of MV in MuSK-MCs compared to IVIG-treatment. While plasma exchange has historically been the favorable treatment in MC, the latest consensus implies an equal effect of PE/IA vs. IVIGs. Considering the low number of patients with MuSK-MG in those studies, separate studies on therapeutic effects of PE/IA vs. IVIGs on specifically MuSK-MC are obligatory to obtain individualized treatment approaches. In contrast to that, some studies already demonstrated a better symptomatic improvement in MuSK-MG after plasma exchanging therapies compared to IVIG, e.g. measured by the MGFA-classification, but data in MC are still lacking. Lately more and more studies discuss a potential favorable role of IA in MuSK-MC, as it is an antibody selective plasma exchange therapy with less risk for side effects compared to Plasmapheresis. This could be confirmed by first data from Lazaridis et al. indicating a significant and sufficient reduction of MuSK-AB serum level through IA. Barth et al. who pointed out an equal effect of PE/IA vs. IVIG, stated that the presence of AChR-ABs predicted a better outcome compared to MuSK-MG or seronegative MG, which might furthermore empower a differentiation of decision-making in MC treatment due to its antibody status.

### Myasthenia gravis with muscle-specific tyrosine kinase antibodies: a narrative review [^116rczeH]. Muscle & Nerve (2018). Low credibility.

Growing evidence provides new insights about myasthenia gravis (MG) with antibodies against muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK-MG), including its pathogenesis, clinical and electrophysiological manifestations, and treatment. Data now support the presence of both presynaptic and postsynaptic dysfunction in MuSK-MG. This is 1 of many key differences between MuSK-MG and acetylcholine receptor antibody-MG (AChR-MG), especially as it pertains to potential therapeutic implications. In comparison to AChR-MG, MuSK-MG is generally more refractory to treatment. However, because MuSK-MG is better understood and more readily recognized today, there are more reports of a relatively benign course. The most effective immunotherapies for MuSK-MG are corticosteroids, plasmapheresis, and rituximab. With appropriate therapy, most patients with MuSK-MG achieve minimal manifestation status or better on the postintervention status outlined by the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America. A minority of patients remain refractory to treatment, and optimal management for this group remains a considerable challenge. Muscle Nerve 58: 344–358, 2018.

### Myasthenia gravis [^116iNGzG]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2019). High credibility.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease caused by antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR), muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) or other AChR-related proteins in the postsynaptic muscle membrane. Localized or general muscle weakness is the predominant symptom and is induced by the antibodies. Patients are grouped according to the presence of antibodies, symptoms, age at onset and thymus pathology. Diagnosis is straightforward in most patients with typical symptoms and a positive antibody test, although a detailed clinical and neurophysiological examination is important in antibody-negative patients. MG therapy should be ambitious and aim for clinical remission or only mild symptoms with near-normal function and quality of life. Treatment should be based on MG subgroup and includes symptomatic treatment using acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, thymectomy and immunotherapy. Intravenous immunoglobulin and plasma exchange are fast-acting treatments used for disease exacerbations, and intensive care is necessary during exacerbations with respiratory failure. Comorbidity is frequent, particularly in elderly patients. Active physical training should be encouraged.

### Generalized myasthenia gravis with acetylcholine receptor antibodies: a guidance for treatment [^116aTLkH]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Generalized myasthenia gravis (MG) with antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor is a chronic disease causing muscle weakness. Access to novel treatments warrants authoritative treatment recommendations. The Nordic countries have similar, comprehensive health systems, mandatory health registers, and extensive MG research.

Methods

MG experts and patient representatives from the five Nordic countries formed a working group to prepare treatment guidance for MG based on a systematic literature search and consensus meetings.

Results

Pyridostigmine represents the first-line symptomatic treatment, while ambenonium and beta adrenergic agonists are second-line options. Early thymectomy should be undertaken if a thymoma, and in non-thymoma patients up to the age of 50-65years if not obtaining remission on symptomatic treatment. Most patients need immunosuppressive drug treatment. Combining corticosteroids at the lowest possible dose with azathioprine is recommended, rituximab being an alternative first-line option. Mycophenolate, methotrexate, and tacrolimus represent second-line immunosuppression. Plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin are used for myasthenic crises and acute exacerbations. Novel complement inhibitors and FcRn blockers are effective and fast-acting treatments with promising safety profiles. Their use depends on local availability, refunding policies, and cost-benefit analyses. Adapted physical training is recommended. Planning of pregnancies with optimal treatment, information, and awareness of neonatal MG is necessary. Social support and adaptation of work and daily life activities are recommended.

Conclusions

Successful treatment of MG rests on timely combination of different interventions. Due to spontaneous disease fluctuations, comorbidities, and changes in life conditions, regular long-term specialized follow-up is needed. Most patients do reasonably well but there is room for further improvement. Novel treatments are promising, though subject to restricted access due to costs.

ASCO guideline — myasthenia gravis (MG) during immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICPi) therapy: All grades warrant workup and intervention given potential for progressive MG to lead to respiratory compromise, and inpatient admission may be appropriate at all grades. For grade 2 (G2; some symptoms interfering with ADLs and MGFA class I and II), hold ICPi and may resume only if symptoms resolve and steroid taper completed, obtain neurology consultation, strongly consider inpatient care as patients can deteriorate quickly, start pyridostigmine 30 mg PO three times a day with gradual titration to a maximum of 120 mg PO four times a day as tolerated with close collaboration with the neurologist, and administer corticosteroids. For grade 3–4 (G3-4; limiting self-care with dysphagia, facial or respiratory muscle weakness, or rapidly progressive symptoms), follow G2 recommendations and add: permanently discontinue ICPi, admit the patient with possible ICU-level monitoring, continue steroids with taper beginning 3–4 weeks after initiation then wean based on symptom improvement, initiate IVIG 2 G/kg IV over 5 days (0.4 G/kg/d) or plasmapheresis × 5 days, consider adding rituximab if refractory to IVIG or plasmapheresis, perform frequent pulmonary function assessment, and conduct daily neurologic review.

### Myasthenia and the neuromuscular junction [^113FUk5g]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Myasthenic syndromes are distinct disorders at the neuromuscular junction, most often with well characterized autoimmune or genetic pathology. New aspects of the dysfunctions give insight into the normal neuromuscular function in addition to giving therapeutic clues and tailoring the therapy to the pathophysiology in individual patients.

Recent Findings

Patients with myasthenia gravis and congenital myasthenic syndromes should be further classified into distinct subgroups. Myasthenia gravis with low-affinity acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies and myasthenia gravis with antibodies to the postsynaptic low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 represent new groups, whereas a myasthenia gravis subgroup without any detectable antibodies still persists. Myasthenia gravis with antibodies against muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) is, due to new reports, now as established as AChR-myasthenia gravis regarding disease mechanisms and recommended therapy.

Summary

Myasthenic syndromes and myasthenia gravis are well characterized disorders. The prognosis is generally good, apart from paraneoplastic Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. However, patients need long-term symptomatic and immunoactive treatment, this treatment to be balanced against present and potential side effects. New and more selective treatment is needed, especially for severe generalized disease. Well controlled long-term studies of sufficient power are much wanted, but new therapy has often to be tried in patients before high-class evidence of effect on myasthenia gravis has been published.

### Myasthenia gravis in 2025: five new things and four hopes for the future [^117SZJJ8]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 2016, as the milestone of the randomized trial of thymectomy in generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) approached, our review 'Myasthenia gravis: a clinical-immunological update' looked forward to this pivotal trial, and outlined and forecast other key developments. Since that date, the treatment landscape in MG has expanded even beyond anticipation with multiple new immunotherapies arriving in clinical practice. We continue to see an increase in late-onset MG (LOMG) and also long-standing disease in people living with MG for decades, requiring thoughtful practice and consideration of the impact of age, co-morbidities and long-term immunosuppression on these populations.

In this review, we will focus on 'five new things' which, in our view, constitute the most transformative developments in the field since our 2016 review, and then express 'four hopes' for the future across different domains of MG in the next 10 years. Our 'five new things' include thymectomy, new immunotherapies, recent guidelines, progress in biomarkers, and the concept of MG 'age' and 'stage', and restricting ourselves to acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-positive and muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) antibody-positive patients. We will not focus in depth on ocular or seronegative MG, recapitulate established treatments, or touch on less frequently found antibodies.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: 2020 update [^112UeoaN]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

The risk of MG and other immune-mediated neurologic illnesses should be discussed with patients who are candidates for ICIs (median 9, range 5–9).
At this time, there is no evidence to either support or refute the utility of AChR antibody testing in patients without MG before starting ICIs (median 8, range 7–9).
MG associated with ICIs is generally severe, with a high rate of respiratory crises (median 8, range 5–9).
Preexisting MG does not constitute an absolute contraindication to the use of ICIs, at least in patients with well-controlled disease (MM status or better). However, in these patients:

- It may be prudent to avoid combined therapy (anti–CTLA-4 plus anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies), given the higher potential for severe irAEs.
- Close clinical monitoring, particularly of respiratory and bulbar function, is mandatory.
- Although the therapeutic response to ICIs seems to be less satisfactory in patients receiving immunosuppressants, MG treatment should be maintained and may even be restarted in patients whose MG is in remission before treatment with ICIs (median 8, range 5–9).
Early aggressive treatment with high-dose steroids in combination with plasma exchange or IVIg may be required in patients who develop overt MG while on ICIs. The decision to withdraw ICIs is determined by the oncologic status (median 8, range 7–9) (table e-9).

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: executive summary [^117Y1CKs]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop formal consensus-based guidance for the management of myasthenia gravis (MG).

Methods

In October 2013, the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America appointed a Task Force to develop treatment guidance for MG, and a panel of 15 international experts was convened. The RAND/UCLA appropriateness methodology was used to develop consensus guidance statements. Definitions were developed for goals of treatment, minimal manifestations, remission, ocular MG, impending crisis, crisis, and refractory MG. An in-person panel meeting then determined 7 treatment topics to be addressed. Initial guidance statements were developed from literature summaries. Three rounds of anonymous e-mail votes were used to attain consensus on guidance statements modified on the basis of panel input.

Results

Guidance statements were developed for symptomatic and immunosuppressive treatments, IV immunoglobulin and plasma exchange, management of impending and manifest myasthenic crisis, thymectomy, juvenile MG, MG associated with antibodies to muscle-specific tyrosine kinase, and MG in pregnancy.

Conclusion

This is an international formal consensus of MG experts intended to be a guide for clinicians caring for patients with MG worldwide.

### Immunomodulators and immunosuppressants for myasthenia gravis: a network meta-analysis [^112nKTFi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Individuals with MG are typically divided into different subgroups according to the age of onset (juvenile‐onset, ≤ 18 years; early‐onset, 19 to 50 years; or late‐onset, > 50 years), the associated antibodies (including AChR, MuSK, LRP4 and seronegative), the association with thymoma (thymoma‐associated MG), and the clinical phenotype (ocular or gMG).

Approximately 70% of individuals with MG have thymic follicular hyperplasia, usually benign, which is often associated with AChR antibodies. Thymoma‐associated MG is a paraneoplastic variant of the disease, occurring in approximately 10% to 20% of patients, more frequently in those over 50. Thus, all individuals with a recent diagnosis of MG should undergo screening for thymoma. Once diagnosed, a thymectomy should be performed as soon as possible, especially in those with JMG and AChR‐positive MG, due to the higher likelihood of spontaneous remission.

Description of the intervention and how it might work

gMG treatment goals include achieving minimal symptoms or improving the patient's condition while minimising treatment side effects. Timely treatment initiation is crucial to preventing physical and psychological morbidity over the long term, particularly in JMG. Pharmacological treatment for gMG typically begins with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (such as pyridostigmine). However, as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors may often be insufficient, many guidelines recommend early initiation of immunosuppressive therapy. Neurologists may initiate immunosuppression in these cases, starting with corticosteroids alone or associated with a non‐steroidal immunosuppressant (NSISTs). Additionally, in cases of insufficient response to glucocorticoids, or when aiming for corticoid sparing, addressing corticoid dependence, or managing steroid intolerance, clinicians often add NSISTs like azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil. Long‐term use of NSISTs requires close monitoring due to the risk of severe adverse events (Table 1). Moreover, thymectomy is important and indicated for all AChR‐positive MG and patients with a diagnosis of thymoma, regardless of MG status, unless a contraindication exists. In addition to pharmacological treatment, avoiding known triggers (such as certain medications, infections, and surgeries) is essential to prevent exacerbations and optimise disease control.

Management of myasthenia gravis

Initial management of myasthenia gravis depends on the clinical severity of the disease at presentation. Myasthenia gravis crises typically present with severe bulbar or respiratory involvement, or rapidly progressive disease; these are managed as inpatient cases, with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg; antibodies taken from the blood of healthy donors) or plasma exchange (removal of the affected person's plasma, which is the part of the blood that contains antibodies, and replacing it with donated plasma), along with respiratory support in the hospital intensive care unit if required. Management of myasthenia gravis in people who are not in crisis can be initiated in the outpatient setting. The initial treatment of choice is typically a medication called pyridostigmine, with the addition of oral prednisolone (a type of steroid treatment) if the person remains symptomatic. Immunosuppression is generally reserved for those who do not achieve remission on prednisolone therapy, or who experience relapse (return of their myasthenia gravis symptoms) on prednisolone withdrawal. Azathioprine is typically used as the first‐line immunosuppressive agent, while other options include mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, and ciclosporin. In difficult‐to‐treat cases, a medication called rituximab can be used, which acts to deplete the cells of the immune system that produce antibodies (known as B cells). Response to rituximab is better in people with MuSK antibody‐positive myasthenia gravis compared with those with AChR antibody‐positive myasthenia gravis, and a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of rituximab as an add‐on therapy to prednisolone treatment for myasthenia gravis did not demonstrate a clinically meaningful steroid‐sparing effect at 12 months compared with prednisolone plus placebo. If imaging shows evidence of a thymoma, it should be removed as this can result in spontaneous remission of myasthenia gravis (complete resolution of the symptoms of myasthenia gravis). Additionally, in people without a thymoma who are under 65 years and AChR antibody‐positive, there is evidence that thymus removal can reduce their myasthenia gravis medication requirements.

### Randomized study of adjunctive belimumab in participants with generalized myasthenia gravis [^114x9rCH]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Myasthenia gravis (MG), an acquired autoimmune disorder of neuromuscular transmission, affects over 700,000 people worldwide. Approximately 85% of generalized MG cases are associated with postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies at the motor endplate, and reduced functional AChRs. Approximately 5%–8% of patients have muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibodies. Lipoprotein receptor–related protein 4 antibodies may also be clinically relevant.

Numerous (predominantly off-label) treatments are prescribed for MG, as summarized in a recent international consensus guidance statement for MG treatment by a Task Force of the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America. Many patients do not achieve adequate clinical response, having substantial disability despite treatment. Developing a therapy suitable for all patients is challenging due to disease heterogeneity. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (e.g. pyridostigmine) are considered first-line treatments for MG; however, patients with anti-MuSK antibodies often respond poorly. Glucocorticoids or nonsteroidal immunosuppressant therapy are recommended in patients failing to meet treatment goals following an adequate pyridostigmine trial.

Belimumab (Benlysta, Rockville, MD), a human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1λ monoclonal antibody against B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS), is licensed for adult patients with active, autoantibody-positive systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) receiving standard SLE therapy. Elevated BLyS levels have been identified in patients with MG, highlighting it as a potential treatment target. Other monoclonal antibodies (e.g. rituximab and eculizumab) targeting different immune elements have demonstrated promising results.

This study investigated the efficacy and safety of belimumab in participants with active generalized MG despite receiving standard therapy.

New treatments: integration into real world practice and updated guidelines

Our 2016 review summarized European and UK best practice guidelines and advice for expectant mothers. Since then, the considerable expansion of available therapies calls for consideration of how these are integrated into clinical practice and national/international best practice guidelines. It is expected that use of new agents will evolve over time, requiring repeated expert body attention and assessment of parameters including safety, cost, de-escalation and combination options.

2020 saw the release of updated International Consensus Guidance, incorporating expert views on thymectomy, Rituximab, and Eculizumab. In summary, advice was for early consideration of thymectomy in those aged 18–50 with nonthymomatous AChR-antibody positive disease, and, reflecting the inclusion of individuals aged up to 65 in the MGTX study, in all patients with AChR-positive MG deemed non-responsive to or intolerant of initial immunotherapy. Early use of Rituximab in MuSK-antibody-positive patients and Eculizumab for severe or refractory AChR-antibody gMG was also recommended. Other complement inhibitors and FcRN inhibitors were not yet available for discussion. In addition, Japanese guidelines published in 2022, including Eculizumab, stated this should be considered when more established modalities of IVIG or plasma exchange are inadequate to control symptoms. These guidelines also highlighted the role of thymectomy in AChR-antibody-positive disease.

Myasthenia gravis with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) — features, serology, risk, and management: Myasthenia gravis is a significant neurological toxicity with a high potential for patient fatality, and patients with myasthenia gravis may also develop myocarditis and/or myositis as part of a potentially dangerous combination of pathologies. A retrospective analysis of ICI-related myasthenia gravis reported serological positivity rates by anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and anti-MuSK antibodies of 66.7% (30/45) and 5.3% (1/19), respectively. Patients treated with anti-PD-(L)1 ICIs are at greater risk of developing myasthenia gravis than those treated with anti-CTLA-4 ICIs. The standard of care for myasthenia gravis includes IVIG and plasma exchange (PLEX), and in autoimmune myasthenia gravis also includes high-dose pulse corticosteroids.

### Myasthenia gravis: Association of British Neurologists' management guidelines [^114mCGy4]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease of the neuromuscular junction for which many therapies were developed before the era of evidence based medicine. The basic principles of treatment are well known, however, patients continue to receive suboptimal treatment as a result of which a myasthenia gravis guidelines group was established under the aegis of The Association of British Neurologists. These guidelines attempt to steer a path between evidence-based practice where available, and established best practice where evidence is unavailable. Where there is insufficient evidence or a choice of options, the guidelines invite the clinician to seek the opinion of a myasthenia expert. The guidelines support clinicians not just in using the right treatments in the right order, but in optimising the use of well-known therapeutic agents. Clinical practice can be audited against these guidelines.

Rituximab

Most studies of RTX are retrospective, and some combine patients with AChR-Ab, MuSK-Ab, and seronegative MG. A multicenter blinded prospective review of MuSK-Ab + MG patients demonstrated that 14 of 24 (58%) patients treated with RTX achieved MM status and required only low-dose IS therapy, compared with 5 of 31 (16%) of the non-RTX group.

In a prospective open-label study of 22 refractory AChR-Ab+, MuSK-Ab+, and seronegative MG, MG manual muscle testing (MMT) scores revealed significant improvement from baseline at a mean follow-up of 29 ± 19 months in the AChR-Ab+ and MuSK-Ab+ groups. Another prospective open-label study of 14 patients with refractory AChR-Ab+, MuSK-Ab+, and seronegative MG reported improvement in MMT scores at a mean follow-up of 22 months. The time to peak response after a single cycle of RTX was 4.5 ± 1 months. A retrospective multicenter study of MuSK-Ab + MG reported that RTX given in the dose of 375 mg/m² weekly for 4 weeks and then monthly for the next 2 months was associated with lower relapse rates (18%) compared with a regimen of two 1 g infusions separated by 2 weeks (80%). A retrospective Austrian nationwide study of 56 patients with AChR-Ab+ and MuSK-Ab + MG reported that 26% of patients were in remission 3 months after treatment with varying dosing protocols of RTX. At a median of 20 months, 43% were in remission and 25% achieved MM status. A single-center retrospective study of 21 AChR-Ab+, 3 MuSK-Ab+, and 4 patients with double-seronegative MG found that muscle strength improved significantly from baseline at 6 months and then stabilized up to 36 months, and PIS was improved in 43% at 6 months. A retrospective combined analysis of previously published case reports of 169 patients between January 2000 and August 2015 reported that 72% of MuSK-Ab + MG and 30% of AChR-Ab+ MG patients treated with RTX achieved MM status or better. The number of cycles of RTX varied but did not have an effect on the response. A recent systematic review of previous studies of 165 patients with AChR-Ab+ MG treated with RTX concluded that despite heterogeneous outcome measures, significant clinical improvement was seen in 113 patients (68%), with 36% achieving remission. A phase II RCT of RTX (Beat-MG) enrolled 52 patients with generalized nonthymomatous AChR-Ab+ MG on a stable regimen of prednisone for 4 weeks or prednisone plus another IS agent for 6 months. Two cycles of RTX 6 months apart were compared to placebo with the primary outcome being a steroid-sparing effect (≥ 75% reduction in mean daily prednisone requirements in the 4 weeks before week 52 compared with the 4-week period before randomization). The study was designed to assess futility (nonsuperiority). Preliminary results reported that the area under the curve for prednisone was not significantly different between RTX and placebo groups, with 60% on RTX and 56% on placebo achieving the primary outcome. There were no significant differences in mean QMG or MG-composite (MGC) changes between the groups. The study suggests that in mildly to moderately symptomatic generalized AChR-Ab+ MG, RTX is unlikely to have a clinically meaningful steroid-sparing effect over 12 months.

### Young child with MuSK myasthenia gravis: treatment and remission with rituximab [^11187x5W]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder characterised by autoantibodies directed against postsynaptic receptors of the neuromuscular junction. Muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) myasthenia gravis is a subtype of myasthenia gravis containing antibodies specific to the MuSK subunit of the motor endplate. MuSK myasthenia gravis tends to display a severe clinical course, and most patients are refractory to treatment. Paediatric MuSK myasthenia gravis is exceedingly rare and is typically managed with pyridostigmine, corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin or plasmapheresis for acute crisis control. This report discusses a case of a 4-year-old girl diagnosed with MuSK myasthenia gravis who was treated with rituximab. She is one of the youngest children in the literature to receive rituximab for this condition, and she continues to show favourable outcomes. This case demonstrates the safety and efficacy of this treatment in paediatric patients diagnosed with MuSK myasthenia gravis.

### Myasthenic syndromes: mistaking genetic for acquired [^114BAhQh]. Practical Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) are a rare, heterogeneous group of disorders caused by pathogenic variants in genes encoding proteins essential for neuromuscular transmission. DOK7 variants are among the most common causes of CMS and one of the subtypes that may worsen with pyridostigmine. We report two patients who presented in adulthood with fatigable limb girdle weakness, initially diagnosed with seronegative myasthenia gravis, who slowly progressed over time despite escalating treatment and eventually needed intensive care admission. Revisiting the history led to the diagnosis of DOK7 CMS. Both patients improved after stopping immunosuppressants and pyridostigmine and starting salbutamol. These cases highlight the importance of considering CMS in patients with seronegative myasthenia gravis.

### A woman with dyspnea, dysphagia, and dysarthria | NEJM resident 360… [^113GzR7w]. resident360.nejm.org (2024). Medium credibility.

Literature Clinical Pearls & Morning Reports Published October 16, 2024 A hallmark of myasthenia gravis is fatigable weakness. Read the NEJM Case Records of the Massachusetts General Hospital here. Clinical Pearls Q: What causes myasthenia gravis. A: Myasthenia gravis is caused by antibodies against postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors and is characterized by bulbar, ocular, facial, limb, and axial weakness. In 60% of patients, the presenting sign is asymmetric ptosis, diplopia, or both; approximately 10% of patients have an associated thymoma. Q: Are there pathogenic antibodies in myasthenia gravis other than acetylcholine receptor–binding antibodies. A: Acetylcholine receptor–binding antibodies have high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of generalized myasthenia gravis.

These pathogenic antibodies lead to dysfunction of the acetylcholine receptor through functional blocking of the receptor and complement-mediated destruction of the postsynaptic membrane. Other pathogenic antibodies directed against structural proteins of the acetylcholine receptor include anti–muscle-specific kinase antibodies. A: The management of myasthenic crisis in patients with previously untreated myasthenia gravis is highly complex. Efficacy is based on clinical response instead of antibody titers. The treatment approach to myasthenic crisis involves first stabilizing life-threatening respiratory-muscle weakness and then addressing the underlying autoimmune disorder, with the goal of restoring neuromuscular function sufficiently to minimize symptoms and prevent relapse. Immediate measures include intensive care and ventilatory support with either mechanical ventilation or noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation.

Rapid-acting treatment options for myasthenic crisis are plasma exchange and the administration of intravenous immune globulin. Additional immunotherapy is recommended once the patient's condition is medically stable. A: Prednisone is used as a first-line immunosuppressive agent for patients in myasthenic crisis. High doses of prednisone are recommended for patients in myasthenic crisis to allow for a shorter time to clinical effect. However, high-dose glucocorticoid therapy leads to transient disease exacerbation in nearly half of patients with myasthenia gravis who receive such treatment, typically within the first 1 or 2 weeks after the initiation of therapy. In patients with severe myasthenia gravis, including those in myasthenic crisis, nonsteroidal immunosuppressants can be administered early, in addition to prednisone.

First-line nonsteroidal immunosuppressive agents used for the treatment of myasthenia gravis include mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, calcineurin inhibitors, and methotrexate; rituximab is typically reserved for patients with refractory disease. Newer antibody-based biologic agents, including complement inhibitors and Fc receptor antagonists, are becoming less costly and more readily accessible as glucocorticoid-sparing medications.

Topics Identified for the Development of Recommendations

Based on the availability of new clinical trial data that the panel co-chairs determined may affect previous recommendations or lend themselves to new recommendations, the following interventions were selected: thymectomy, rituximab (RTX) in MG with antibodies to acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) and muscle-specific kinase (MuSK), eculizumab, and methotrexate (MTX). Recommendations were also developed to inform early immunosuppression in ocular MG, the role of physical training/exercise in MG, and the management of MG associated with immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment. Physical training/exercise was excluded after review because of the low quality of evidence informing recommendations.

The RAND/UCLA appropriateness method for formal consensus was used to obtain consensus, with the same a priori assumptions regarding treatment availability and costs as in the initial guidance document. All voting was conducted by e-mail and the responses returned only to the methodologist to avoid the potential for panel members' opinions and votes being influenced by others. Topics were voted on sequentially, although rounds of voting for different topics frequently overlapped for efficiency. All recommendation statements were edited after the first round of voting by the co-chairs and methodologist in response to the panel's suggestions for changes and depending on whether consensus was reached or not. The edited recommendations were sent by e-mail to the panel along with collated panel comments from the previous round for voting. The process was repeated for up to 3 rounds of voting, as needed. Recommendations that did not achieve consensus after 3 rounds of voting were discarded. The panel rated each recommendation for appropriateness on a 9-point scale (1–3: inappropriate, 4–6: uncertain, and 7–9: appropriate). Median and range were calculated for each recommendation to assess appropriateness and agreement per the RAM method. Tables e1-e10, summarize all the recommendations of the original guideline that are still current plus those from the present update. Table 1 provides an update of drugs to avoid or use with caution in MG.

Thymectomy for non-thymomatous MuSK antibody associated MG

In contrast to AchR antibody-associated MG, thymic pathology is relatively rare in patients with MuSK antibody-associated MG. Accordingly, one study could not prove any effect of thymectomy in 15 MuSK antibody-positive patients, whilst MuSK antibodies predicted a poor outcome of thymectomy in another study. Hence, available evidence suggests that in general thymectomy should not be recommended in MuSK antibody-associated MG. However, as few MuSK antibody-positive patients have been reported to apparently improve following thymectomy it may be considered in single cases with otherwise poor disease control.

Thymectomy for non-thymomatous seronegative MG

A retrospective cohort study of thymectomy reported similar post-operative results in AChR antibody-negative and AChR antibody-positive MG patients with a follow-up of at least 3 years. Remission or improvement after thymectomy occurred in 57% of AChR antibody-negative patients and in 51% of AChR antibody-positive patients. Hence, thymectomy is recommended for patients with generalized MG without detectable AChR and MuSK antibodies similar to those patients with AChR antibodies.

Technique of thymectomy

Standard procedure for thymectomy used to be the extended transsternal thymectomy with excision of the whole thymus and retrosternal adipose tissue aiming at a maximal thymectomy. However, minimal invasive interventions are increasingly applied. While these studies cannot be compared to each other due to pronounced confounding factors, the reported effects on therapeutic and clinic surrogates seem to be equivalent. Hence minimally invasive thymectomy represents an option alternative to the gold standard of extended transternal thymectomy and is used by an increasing number of centers.

A suggested treatment regimen is depicted in Table 3.

### Treatment of ocular myasthenia… [^115mAyUq]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

HACHINSKIVLADIMIRMD, DSc MYASTHENIA gravis preferentially involves the ocular muscles. 1 Ocular myasthenia manifests as weakness of the levator palpebrae superioris leading to ptosis, or the extraocular muscles producing diplopia. The precise reasons for this predilection are poorly understood. 2, 3 As with all therapies for MG, there are few well-controlled studies of treatments of ocular myasthenia. 4 Immunosuppressive therapies, in particular the corticosteroid prednisone, are the mainstay of treatment for generalized MG that compromises an individual's daily activities. Prednisone is also commonly used for ocular myasthenia. However, 4 factors should be considered prior to the use of steroids for patients with MG isolated to the ocular muscles: Could the patient's symptoms improve with safer forms of therapy. Will steroid treatment lead to resolution of symptoms. Does the severity of the symptoms warrant the risk of steroid adverse effects.

Do steroids reduce the chance of generalization. We consider each of these questions and reach the conclusion that only the occasional case of ocular myasthenia should be treated with steroids.

Methotrexate

Studies on the use of MTX in MG are limited, and the available data do not provide convincing evidence of efficacy. In a retrospective case series of 16 patients with MG treated with MTX, (abstract only) 8 patients reduced pyridostigmine doses and 6 showed "clinical improvement". A prospective open-label case series published only as an abstract reported that 14 of 16 patients with MG treated with MTX had an improved PIS on a mean follow-up of 20.6 months. In a single-blinded trial, 24 patients with generalized MG on prednisone were randomized to MTX (11) or azathioprine (13). At 24 months, the average prednisone dose required to achieve and maintain MM status was lower in both MTX- and azathioprine-treated patients but was not different between the groups. At months 10 and 12, the prednisone dose was lower in the MTX group, but the confidence interval includes clinically meaningful and nonmeaningful effects. Similar proportions of both groups achieved MM status, and there were no differences in QMG or MG-activity of daily living (MG-ADL) scores between the groups. An RCT enrolled 50 patients with AChR-Ab+ MG taking prednisone at a dose of ≥ 10 mg/d. Patients were randomized 1:1 to MTX 20 mg/wk or placebo. There was no difference in the primary outcome measure, the area under the prednisone dose-time curve between months 4 and 12, and the mean 12-month change in QMG, MMT, MG-Quality of life, MG-ADL, and MGC was no different between treatment groups.

Recommendation

Although evidence from RCTs is lacking, oral MTX may be considered as a steroid-sparing agent in patients with generalized MG who have not tolerated or responded to steroid-sparing agents that are better supported by RCT data (median 9, range 5–9) (table e-2).

Ocular MG

A small RCT comparing prednisone with placebo in patients with 11 ocular MG who had previously failed to achieve minimal manifestation (MM) status after 4–6 weeks of pyridostigmine found that 5 of 6 participants (83%) in the prednisone group achieved the primary end point of sustained MM status at a median of 14 weeks on prednisone (median dose 15 mg/d), compared with none of 5 in the placebo group. Three of the 5 placebo participants switched to prednisone (60 mg/d) with rapid taper; 2 attained sustained MM status. A prospective cohort study of 13 consecutive ocular and 76 generalized MG patients evaluated the effect of IS agents on ophthalmoparesis. Fifty-nine percent of patients had complete resolution of ophthalmoparesis within 12 ± 2 months of initiation of IS agents. Patients with milder ophthalmoparesis had greater odds of symptom resolution in the first year of treatment. Median time to resolution was 7 months after IS agents were started.

Evidence for the efficacy of thymectomy in ocular MG is limited by the retrospective design of most published studies. In a case-control study of 47 patients with nonthymomatous ocular MG who underwent thymectomy matched to 67 patients who refused surgery, there was no difference in the proportion of patients achieving stable remission at a median follow-up of 100–116 months. A retrospective analysis of 236 patients with thymomatous and nonthymomatous MG reported no improvement after thymectomy in 25 patients, of whom 17 (68%) were ocular or predominantly ocular, over 12 months of follow-up. In another retrospective case series of 52 patients with MG, only 2 of 11 patients with ocular MG (18%) achieved remission after thymectomy, in contrast to 28%–50% of patients with generalized MG.

### Update on muscle-specific tyrosine kinase antibody positive myasthenia gravis [^113tniP7]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Important concepts regarding the pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibody positive myasthenia gravis will be reviewed. Special attention will be paid to clinical phenotypes and treatment, particularly encouraging responses that have been reported to rituximab.

Recent Findings

Worldwide studies confirm three major phenotypes in MuSK antibody positive myasthenia gravis (MMG) patients: indistinguishable from acetylcholine receptor antibody positive patients, prominent faciopharyngeal weakness, usually with marked muscle atrophy, and relatively isolated neck extensor and respiratory weakness. MMG predominates in women and weakness is typically more severe, with more frequent respiratory crises than non-MuSK myasthenia gravis. Patients with sub-acute bulbar, shoulder, and neck weakness pose unique challenges in terms of differential diagnosis and electrodiagnosis. Electrodiagnostic studies evaluating for disorders of neuromuscular transmission should focus on proximal limb and facial muscles, as well as clinically weak muscles. The response to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors is often disappointing. Long-term outcomes appear favorable though patients typically require more aggressive immunosuppression. Uncontrolled observations report encouraging results with rituximab in the treatment of refractory MMG. The role of thymectomy in the management of these patients remains uncertain.

Summary

MuSK antibody positive patients represent a unique subset of myasthenia gravis. Identification of these patients has important diagnostic and disease management implications.

### Development of generalized disease at 2 years in patients with ocular myasthenia gravis… [^115UgVZr]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

We reviewed an ocular myasthenia gravis database of 147 patients. Patients underwent measurement of acetylcholine receptor antibody levels and chest computed tomography. Unless contraindicated, patients with diplopia were recommended for therapy with prednisone, up to 40 to 60 mg/d, with the dosage tapered for 5 to 6 weeks. Most continued to receive daily or alternate-day doses of 2. 5 to 10 mg to prevent diplopia. Patients not given prednisone received pyridostigmine bromide or no medication. After the diagnosis, we documented the signs and symptoms of ocular and generalized myasthenia gravis and performed 2-year follow-up in 94 patients. Results The mean dose of edrophonium chloride to give a positive response was 3. 3 mg for ptosis and
2. 6 mg for ocular motor dysfunction. Thymoma occurred in 1 patient.

Conclusions At 2 years, prednisone treatment appears to reduce the incidence of generalized myasthenia gravis to 7% in contrast to 36% of patients who did not receive prednisone. Thymoma, although uncommon, occurs in ocular myasthenia gravis. Only small amounts of edrophonium are needed to diagnose ocular myasthenia gravis. If larger dosages are used for a short time, few major adverse effects should result, even if lower doses are continued for many months. Kupersmith et al4 reported that a moderate dose, reduced during a 6-week course and followed by low-dose daily or alternate-day corticosteroid therapy, reduced the conversion rate to generalized myasthenia gravis to 9% in a small cohort of 32 patients.

The development of systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, gastrointestinal tract disorders, or infectious illness that typically occur with moderate- to high-dose daily or alternate-day therapy7 should be minimized with long-term dosages of no greater than 10 mg/d, use of cointerventions to control blood pressure and hyperglycemia. In questionable cases, patients had to have abnormal findings on repetitive stimulation electromyography with a minimum decrement of 10%. Patients were not randomized for therapy. Because previous work suggested that corticosteroids alleviate diplopia in the primary gaze, 4 except in patients who refused or had contraindications, patients with diplopia in primary or downward gaze and extraocular muscle dysfunction or ptosis that blocked vision and was unresponsive to pyridostigmine bromide were treated with prednisone.

Patients with these exceptions, including active gastrointestinal tract ulcer or a history of tuberculosis, diabetes mellitus that was difficult to control, severe hypertension, and congestive heart failure, and patients who refused treatment, constituted the untreated group. The duration of symptoms before starting treatment was not uniform. Patients with a history of a positive purified protein derivative finding or 1 or more calcified lesions suggestive of healed tuberculosis on the chest CT received isoniazid, 300 mg/d, and pyridoxine hydrochloride, 50 mg/d, concomitantly with the prednisone. All prednisone-treated patients were prescribed a daily histamine blocker and supplemental calcium, 1000 to 1500 mg/d, as long as prednisone therapy was continued. The prednisone dosage was started at 10 mg/d for 2 days, followed by 20 mg/d for 2 days. The dosage was increased to 50 to 60 mg/d for 4 to 5 days.

IVIg and PLEX.

1. PLEX and IVIg are appropriately used as short-term treatments in patients with MG with life-threatening signs such as respiratory insufficiency or dysphagia; in preparation for surgery in patients with significant bulbar dysfunction; when a rapid response to treatment is needed; when other treatments are insufficiently effective; and prior to beginning corticosteroids if deemed necessary to prevent or minimize exacerbations.
2. The choice between PLEX and IVIg depends on individual patient factors (e.g. PLEX cannot be used in patients with sepsis and IVIg cannot be used in renal failure) and on the availability of each.
3. IVIg and PLEX are probably equally effective in the treatment of severe generalized MG.
4. The efficacy of IVIg is less certain in milder MG or in ocular MG.
5. PLEX may be more effective than IVIg in MuSK-MG.
6. The use of IVIg as maintenance therapy can be considered for patients with refractory MG or for those in whom IS agents are relatively contraindicated.

### Myasthenia gravis: the changing treatment landscape in the era of molecular therapies [^112RtXUp]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder that affects the neuromuscular junction, leading to muscle weakness and fatigue. MG is caused by antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR), the muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) or other AChR-related proteins that are expressed in the postsynaptic muscle membrane. The standard therapeutic approach for MG has relied on acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, which have shown good efficacy in improving MG-related symptoms in most people with the disease; however, these therapies can carry a considerable burden of long-term adverse effects. Moreover, up to 15% of individuals with MG exhibit limited or no response to these standard therapies. The emergence of molecular therapies, including monoclonal antibodies, B cell-depleting agents and chimeric antigen receptor T cell-based therapies, has the potential to revolutionize the MG treatment landscape. This Review provides a comprehensive overview of the progress achieved in molecular therapies for MG associated with AChR antibodies and MuSK antibodies, elucidating both the challenges and the opportunities these therapies present to the field. The latest developments in MG treatment are described, exploring the potential for personalized medicine approaches.

### Treatment of autoimmune myasthenia gravis [^116sqtZY]. Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Autoimmune myasthenia gravis (MG) is associated with antibodies directed against the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) in 85% of patients. Other postsynaptic neuromuscular junction antigens are implicated, e.g., muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK), in a number of the remaining 15% of patients, so-called seronegative MG. The autoimmune attack generally leads to decreased concentrations of the AChR and damage to the structure of the endplate itself. This information has guided the empiric treatment of patients with MG and has suggested new treatment strategies. Whereas the outcome of patients with MG has improved because of more effective symptomatic treatment, including advances in critical care medicine and the use of cholinesterase inhibitors, the greatest advances have come from therapies that directly reduce the autoimmune attack or modify its effects on the AChR and the surrounding endplate. Immune-directed treatment of patients with MG, which is guided by this information and by data from the management of other autoimmune disease, is aimed at inducing an immunologic remission and then maintaining that remission. Remission induction is usually accomplished through the use of high-dose corticosteroids, frequently in conjunction with IV immunoglobulin or plasmapheresis. Maintenance of the remission is usually accomplished by slow tapering of the corticosteroids along with the use of "steroid-sparing" agents, which include azathioprine, thymectomy, and possibly mycophenolate. Therapy usually begins with cholinesterase inhibitors. If necessary, immune-directed treatment is added, beginning with either thymectomy or high-dose corticosteroids. The short-term therapies, i.e. IV immunoglobulin or plasmapheresis, may be effective in the early stages of treatment or later during an exacerbation. Steroid-sparing medications are usually added to facilitate the tapering phase.

### Guidelines for treatment of autoimmune neuromuscular transmission disorders [^117P6iry]. European Journal of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Important progress has been made in our understanding of the autoimmune neuromuscular transmission (NMT) disorders; myasthenia gravis (MG), Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) and neuromyotonia (Isaacs' syndrome).

Methods

To prepare consensus guidelines for the treatment of the autoimmune NMT disorders, references retrieved from MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library were considered and statements prepared and agreed on by disease experts.

Conclusions

Anticholinesterase drugs should be given first in the management of MG, but with some caution in patients with MuSK antibodies (good practice point). Plasma exchange is recommended in severe cases to induce remission and in preparation for surgery (recommendation level B). IvIg and plasma exchange are effective for the treatment of MG exacerbations (recommendation level A). For patients with non-thymomatous MG, thymectomy is recommended as an option to increase the probability of remission or improvement (recommendation level B). Once thymoma is diagnosed, thymectomy is indicated irrespective of MG severity (recommendation level A). Oral corticosteroids are first choice drugs when immunosuppressive drugs are necessary (good practice point). When long-term immunosuppression is necessary, azathioprine is recommended to allow tapering the steroids to the lowest possible dose whilst maintaining azathioprine (recommendation level A). 3,4-Diaminopyridine is recommended as symptomatic treatment and IvIG has a positive short-term effect in LEMS (good practice point). Neuromyotonia patients should be treated with an antiepileptic drug that reduces peripheral nerve hyperexcitability (good practice point). For paraneoplastic LEMS and neuromyotonia optimal treatment of the underlying tumour is essential (good practice point). Immunosuppressive treatment of LEMS and neuromyotonia should be similar to MG (good practice point).

E. S. ROACHMD Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder that affects the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction membrane. Acetylcholine receptor antibodies are frequently present, and the number of functioning postsynaptic receptors is reduced. Muscle-specific kinase antibodies may be identified in individuals with and without AChR antibodies. 1 Ptosis or diplopia due to ocular muscle involvement are frequently the first symptoms of the disease. 2 Approximately half of the patients are first seen with purely ocular MG; of these, 53% develop generalized MG within 2 years. Furthermore, a spontaneous remission rate of 30% has been reported in patients with OMG during a 15-year period. 3 Both AChR and muscle-specific kinase antibodies may be present in OMG.

### Clinical features, pathogenesis, and treatment of myasthenia gravis: a supplement to the guidelines of the German Neurological Society [^111YD3uZ]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune antibody-mediated disorder of neuromuscular synaptic transmission. The clinical hallmark of MG consists of fluctuating fatigability and weakness affecting ocular, bulbar and (proximal) limb skeletal muscle groups. MG may either occur as an autoimmune disease with distinct immunogenetic characteristics or as a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with tumors of the thymus. Impairment of central thymic and peripheral self-tolerance mechanisms in both cases is thought to favor an autoimmune CD4(+) T cell-mediated B cell activation and synthesis of pathogenic high-affinity autoantibodies of either the IgG1 and 3 or IgG4 subclass. These autoantibodies bind to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AchR) itself, or muscle-specific tyrosine-kinase (MuSK), lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (LRP4) and agrin involved in clustering of AchRs within the postsynaptic membrane and structural maintenance of the neuromuscular synapse. This results in disturbance of neuromuscular transmission and thus clinical manifestation of the disease. Emphasizing evidence from clinical trials, we provide an updated overview on immunopathogenesis, and derived current and future treatment strategies for MG divided into: (a) symptomatic treatments facilitating neuromuscular transmission, (b) antibody-depleting treatments, and

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: 2020 update [^116Gqyt9]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of myasthenia gravis (MG) have historically been difficult to develop because of limited evidence from studies with a low risk of bias such as large, well-designed randomized controlled trial studies (RCTs). To address the lack of uniform, globally accepted standards for the care of people with MG, the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) appointed a Task Force in 2013 to develop treatment recommendations for MG. A panel of 15 international experts in the treatment of MG was convened and, in 2016, published an international consensus guidance for the management of MG.

Results of several new trials of MG treatment have been published since that guidance statement was published, and in 2019, the panel reviewed the previous recommendations for currency and identified new topics that may affect practice. All members of the previous MGFA Task Force participated in this update; one new member (G.C.) was added to the international panel, which now consists of experts from Canada (M.N.), Chile (G.C.), Germany (A.M.), Italy (A.E.), Japan (H.M.), Norway (N.E.G.), the Netherlands (J.V.), Spain (I. I.), UK (J.P.), and USA (P.N. D.S. G.W. M.B. N.K. J.M.M. and D.P.R.). All except P.N. were voting members; P.N. served as the methodologist.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: executive summary [^1173HzkN]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

We have developed international guidance statements for the management of JMG and adult MG. We utilized recent national guidelines and a regional European guideline to assemble a foundation of literature, supplementing their comprehensive literature reviews with additional articles identified by panelists. After reaching agreement on the treatment goals, a 3-round anonymous modified Delphi voting process was used to obtain consensus on guidance statements.

A limitation of consensus-based processes is that subconscious or conscious selection of like-minded panel members may result in opinions that are not representative of MG experts. This issue was addressed by selecting an international panel with variations in practice and by using a formal consensus process.

Recognizing the variability of practice patterns and availability of treatment modalities, these statements are not absolute recommendations for management, but are intended as a guide for the clinician. They are also not intended for establishing payment policies or drug tiering by payers.

This is a living document that will require updates as the MG treatment theater continues to evolve. Despite the limitations of consensus-based methods, these guidance statements reflect an up-to-date expert consensus to guide clinicians worldwide who strive to optimize function and quality of life for their patients with MG, especially for those who practice in parts of the world that do not have the resources to develop local treatment guidelines. Any future trial of treatment that provides relevant information will merit review of these guidance statements.

Recommendations

Ophthalmoparesis or ptosis in ocular MG that is not responding to anticholinesterase agents should be treated with immunosuppressant agents if symptoms are functionally limiting or troublesome to the patient (median 9, range 7–9).
Corticosteroids should be used as the initial IS agent in ocular MG. Steroid-sparing IS agents may be needed when corticosteroids alone are ineffective, contraindicated, or not tolerated (median 9, range 6–9).
Data from a single small RCT suggest that low-dose corticosteroids may be effective for ocular MG and may avoid side effects associated with high-dose corticosteroids (median 9, range 4–9).
AChR-Ab+ patients with ocular MG who do not respond adequately to acetylcholinesterases and who either prefer not to take IS therapy or have contraindications to or are refractory to IS agents may be offered thymectomy (median 8, range 5–9) (table e-10).

### Clinical and scientific aspects of muscle-specific tyrosine kinase-related myasthenia gravis [^116KBKzR]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Antibodies to muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) characterize up to 5% of myasthenia gravis patients. This review focuses on the differences to clinical antiacetylcholine receptor-myasthenia gravis, and on the physiology and animal studies that elucidate the role of MuSK and help explain the clinical disease.

Recent Findings

MuSK forms the core of a protein complex in the postsynaptic membrane at the neuromuscular junction. During development, MuSK tyrosine kinase signaling is vital for the formation and stabilization of the postsynaptic endplate; it is now clear that long-term homeostasis of mature neuromuscular junctions requires MuSK function. Patient MuSK-antibodies are largely of the IgG4 type and in cell culture block the assembly and activation of MuSK kinase. Active immunization and passive transfer mouse models show reduced postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors and disturbed synaptic alignment, diminished synaptic potentials and impaired muscle activation. MuSK myasthenia gravis patients display particular bulbar and respiratory muscle involvement, with a high rate of myasthenic crises. Plasma exchange and immunosuppression with corticosteroids and rituximab appear to be most effective in treating MuSK myasthenia gravis. In contrast, the cholinesterase inhibitors, such as pyridostigmine, appear less suitable for this form of myasthenia gravis.

Summary

MuSK myasthenia gravis has distinct clinical and pathophysiological features.

### Clinical issue of myasthenia gravis related to immune checkpoint inhibitors [^117A65wp]. Current Oncology Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) are pivotal in the management of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) across various human neoplasms. While common irAEs are manageable by oncologists, the detailed features of rare complications related to ICI therapy remain elusive. Among these, immune-related myasthenia gravis (irMG) stands out as a life-threatening disease.

Recent Findings

Research articles published in English between 2017 and 2023 were identified using the PubMed database. Forty-six relevant research studies were examined to collate information for this review. The incidence of ICI-induced MG was found to be less than 1.0%, with approximately 20–30% of irMG patients presenting with overlap syndrome involving myocarditis and myositis. The detection of acetylcholine receptor antibodies (AChR-Ab) and elevated creatinine kinase (CK) levels proved useful in identifying 50–70% and 60–80% of cases, respectively. However, the utility of muscle-specific kinase antibodies (MuSK-Ab) in detecting irMG was limited due to a low positivity rate (0–5.3%). Ptosis emerged as the most common initial symptom of irMG, with an approximate positivity rate of 80%. Recommended treatment for irMG involves high-dose steroids in conjunction with plasmapheresis or immunoglobulins to mitigate the increased mortality associated with irMG. Early initiation of immunosuppressive therapy is imperative to prevent the worsening of irMG. Furthermore, facilitating a fulfilling social life post-hospitalization is crucial. This review sheds light on the clinical aspects and management strategies pertaining to irMG.

### Diagnosis and therapy of myasthenia gravis with antibodies to muscle-specific kinase [^116STSzZ]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) with antibodies to the muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK-MG) is a rare disease which covers 5–8% of all MG patients. Symptoms are nearly always generalized, though more focal than in MG with anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies, with predominant involvement of cranial, bulbar and axial muscles; early respiratory crises are frequent. Focal atrophy, mostly of facial, masseter and tongue muscles, occurs in a proportion of patients. Diagnosis is often challenging on account of atypical presentation with little or no symptom fluctuations, lack of response to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in a high proportion of patients and negative results of electrodiagnostic studies when performed on limb muscles. Immunosuppression is the mainstay of treatment, since the response to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors is generally unsatisfactory and thymectomy does not appear to improve the course of the disease. Although corticosteroids result in marked improvement, disease flares are frequent during prednisone dosage tapering and most patients remain dependent on treatment. Since treatment with rituximab, in uncontrolled studies, induced sustained benefit in patients with refractory disease, B cell depletion is an attractive option for MuSK-MG patients unresponsive to conventional immunosuppressants.

### When the patient fails to respond to treatment: myasthenia gravis [^115NyPvY]. Practical Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Myasthenia gravis is one of the most satisfying neurological disorders to treat. There are few other conditions in which therapeutic intervention can take a patient from being bed-bound and ventilated to normality. Most patients present with less severe symptoms, but even mild extraocular muscle weakness can be profoundly disabling. The standard therapeutic approach is successful for most patients, which can make the non-specialist neurologist somewhat blasé about its management. However, panic can set in when the standard approach fails. Failure is often the result of incorrect diagnosis, or inappropriate use of first-line treatments. This article outlines the main reasons for failure and gives advice on alternative therapeutic strategies.

### Present status of therapy in myasthenia gravis… [^1126QAZh]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The neuromuscular disorder known as myasthenia gravis was first described by Willis in the 17th century. The clinical features were more distinctly outlined by Erb in 1878, and the periods of remission were emphasized by Goldflam, so that the condition frequently has been referred to as Erb-Goldflam's disease. Since this article is designed to focus attention on the present status of therapy in myasthenia gravis, there will be no effort made to consider in detail the pathology and symptomatology of this disease. For a comprehensive survey of these aspects, reference may be made to the excellent review by Keschner and Strauss.

1. The chief clinical feature of myasthenia gravis is muscle fatigability on sustained effort.

### Longitudinal epitope mapping in MuSK myasthenia gravis: implications for disease severity [^116pggVW]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2016). Low credibility.

Muscle weakness in MuSK myasthenia gravis (MG) is caused predominantly by IgG4 antibodies which block MuSK signalling and destabilize neuromuscular junctions. We determined whether the binding pattern of MuSK IgG4 antibodies change throughout the disease course ("epitope spreading"), and affect disease severity or treatment responsiveness. We mapped the MuSK epitopes of 255 longitudinal serum samples of 53 unique MuSK MG patients from three independent cohorts with ELISA. Antibodies against the MuSK Iglike-1 domain determine disease severity. Epitope spreading outside this domain did not contribute to disease severity nor to pyridostigmine responsiveness. This provides a rationale for epitope specific treatment strategies.

### Autoantibody profile in myasthenia gravis patients with a refractory phase [^113kZEVB]. Muscle & Nerve (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction/Aims

A subgroup of myasthenia gravis (MG) patients fail to respond adequately to recommended treatments, a condition referred to as refractory MG. During the refractory phase, patients experience persistent debilitating symptoms with potential life-threatening events or inability to reduce immunosuppressant dosages and minimize long-term toxicities.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective, single-center study of 113 MG patients to investigate the autoantibody profile and clinical characteristics of refractory MG patients, compared with nonrefractory patients, based on predefined criteria.

Results

Fifteen patients (13.3%) were classified as refractory. Double-seronegative MG (DSNMG), without detectable nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) or muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibodies, was identified in six refractory patients, significantly higher than those with nonrefractory MG (40% vs 16.3%; P = 0.031). None of the refractory patients had MuSK antibodies. Patients in the refractory group more frequently had an earlier disease onset, thymic pathology, and thymectomy (P ≤. 03 for all).

Discussion

In this study, patients with refractory MG were more likely than those with nonrefractory MG to be DSN; and refractory DSNMG patients had worse MGFA classes in their recent visit compared with anti-AChR positive refractory patients. Refractory DSNMG patients may represent a distinct group that requires more individualized and targeted treatment approaches.

### Neuromuscular junction autoimmune disease: muscle specific kinase antibodies and treatments for myasthenia gravis [^112virME]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Some of the 20% of myasthenia gravis patients who do not have antibodies to acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) have antibodies to muscle specific kinase (MuSK), but a full understanding of their frequency, the associated clinical phenotype and the mechanisms of action of the antibodies has not yet been achieved. Moreover, some patients do not respond well to conventional corticosteroid therapy. Here we review recent clinical and experimental studies on MuSK antibody associated myasthenia gravis, and summarize the results of newer treatments for myasthenia gravis.

Recent Findings

MuSK antibodies are found in a variable proportion of AChR antibody negative myasthenia gravis patients who are often, but not exclusively, young adult females, with bulbar, neck, or respiratory muscle weakness. The thymus histology is normal or only very mildly abnormal. Surprisingly, limb or intercostal muscle biopsies exhibit no reduction in AChR numbers or complement deposition. However, patients without AChR or MuSK antibodies appear to be similar to those with AChR antibodies and may have low-affinity AChR antibodies. A variety of treatments, often intended to enable corticosteroid doses to be reduced, have been used in all types of myasthenia gravis with some success, but they have not been subjected to randomized clinical trials.

Summary

MuSK antibodies define a form of myasthenia gravis that can be difficult to diagnose, can be life threatening and may require additional treatments. An improved AChR antibody assay may be helpful in patients without AChR or MuSK antibodies. Clinical trials of drugs in other neuroimmunological diseases may help to guide the treatment of myasthenia gravis.

Removing effector cell types: early is best?

As a mAb to the CD20 marker widely found on B cell populations (Fig. 1), Rituximab is well established in multiple autoimmune diseases and could be anticipated to deplete effector cell types in MG too. Until recently, its use (often in refractory scenarios) was based on observational evidence and case series, some summarized in our previous review, which suggested a promising role particularly in MuSK-MG.

Randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence became available in 2022. The Rinomax anti-CD20 trial recruited new-onset patients, almost all AChR-antibody positive (and none MuSK-antibody positive). The 25 patients in the active arm were more likely to achieve minimal disease manifestation than 22 individuals in the placebo group. By contrast, the BEAT-MG trial, with a similar number of trial participants (52, all AChR-antibody positive, at 5.5 years from disease onset at enrolment), found no meaningful effect in several outcome measures between placebo and treatment groups. This is despite the fact that the Rituximab dose in BEAT-MG, at 375 mg/m² weekly for four weeks, far exceeded the low dose 500 mg infusion given in the early-intervention Rinomax.

MG in pregnancy.

1. Planning for pregnancy should be instituted well in advance to allow time for optimization of myasthenic clinical status and to minimize risks to the fetus.
2. Multidisciplinary communication among relevant specialists should occur throughout pregnancy, during delivery, and in the postpartum period.
3. Provided that their myasthenia is under good control before pregnancy, the majority of women can be reassured that they will remain stable throughout pregnancy. If worsening occurs, it may be more likely during the first few months after delivery.
4. Oral pyridostigmine is the first-line treatment during pregnancy. IV ChEIs may produce uterine contractions and should not be used during pregnancy.
5. Thymectomy should be postponed until after pregnancy as benefit is unlikely to occur during pregnancy.
6. Chest CT without contrast can be performed safely during pregnancy, although the risks of radiation to the fetus need to be carefully considered. Unless there is a compelling indication, postponement of diagnostic CT until after delivery is preferable.
7. Prednisone is the IS agent of choice during pregnancy.
8. Current information indicates that azathioprine and cyclosporine are relatively safe in expectant mothers who are not satisfactorily controlled with or cannot tolerate corticosteroids. Current evidence indicates that mycophenolate mofetil and methotrexate increase the risk of teratogenicity and are contraindicated during pregnancy. (These agents previously carried Food and Drug Administration [FDA] Category C (cyclosporine), D (azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil), and X (methotrexate) ratings. The FDA has recently discontinued this rating system, and replaced it with a summary of the risks of using a drug during pregnancy and breastfeeding, along with supporting data and "relevant information to help health care providers make prescribing and counseling decisions").
Although this statement achieved consensus, there was a strong minority opinion against the use of azathioprine in pregnancy. Azathioprine is the nonsteroidal IS of choice for MG in pregnancy in Europe but is considered high risk in the United States. This difference is based on a small number of animal studies and case reports.
9. PLEX or IVIg are useful when a prompt, although temporary, response is required during pregnancy. Careful consideration of both maternal and fetal issues, weighing the risks of these treatments against the requirement for use during pregnancy and their potential benefits, is required.
10. Spontaneous vaginal delivery should be the objective and is actively encouraged.
11. Magnesium sulfate is not recommended for management of eclampsia in MG because of its neuromuscular blocking effects; barbiturates or phenytoin usually provide adequate treatment.
12. All babies born to myasthenic mothers should be examined for evidence of transient myasthenic weakness, even if the mother's myasthenia is well-controlled, and should have rapid access to neonatal critical care support.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of IMAAVY for the treatment of gMG in adults who are anti-AChR or anti-MuSK antibody positive was established in a 24-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 1; NCT04951622). Patients were treated with IMAAVY with the recommended dosage regimen [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Study 1 enrolled patients with gMG who met the following criteria:

Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) Clinical Classification Class II to IV
Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) total score of at least 6
On stable dose of standard of care MG therapy prior to baseline that included acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors, steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (NSISTs), either in combination or alone.

In Study 1, a total of 196 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive IMAAVY (n = 98) or placebo (n = 98). Baseline characteristics were similar between treatment groups. For the primary efficacy analysis population (n = 153), patients had a median age of 52 years at screening (range 20 to 81 years) and a median time since diagnosis of 6 years. Sixty percent of patients were female; 63% were White; 32% were Asian; 1% were Black or African-American; and < 1% were American Indian or Alaskan Native. At baseline, median MG-ADL total score was 9, and median Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) total score was 15. Eighty-eight percent (n = 134) of patients were positive for AChR antibodies and 10% (n = 16) were positive for MuSK antibodies.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitor-mediated myasthenia gravis [^117SXLcP]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have a wide range of toxicities affecting potentially any organ system stemming from increased activity within the T-cell lineage similar to that observed in autoimmunity.

Case Report

A 57-year-old man with metastatic papillary renal cell carcinoma treatment with combination ICI therapy presented with a history of rapidly progressive diplopia. Neurological examination revealed bilateral fatigable ptosis and asymmetrical ophthalmoplegia. His clinical findings were in keeping with an immune-mediated myasthenia gravis. He was immediately commenced on 1 mg/kg of intravenous methylprednisolone and pyridostigmine 60 mg 3 times a day. On day 2 of admission he was given 1 g/kg of intravenous immunoglobulins. He made a rapid and full clinical recovery. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Immune-mediated myasthenia gravis is an important toxicity of ICIs. Early recognition and treatment of this presentation may reduce the significant morbidity and mortality associated with it.

### Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in MG: to be or not to be? [^112qTH8N]. Muscle & Nerve (2009). Low credibility.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder usually caused by antibodies against either the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) or muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) at the neuromuscular junction. Neuromuscular transmission failure results in muscle fatigue and weakness that can be treated symptomatically with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs). Long-term treatment with nonselective AChEIs may have considerable drawbacks; thus, this medication is ideally tapered when strength improves. Patients with AChR antibodies respond beneficially to treatment, whereas patients with MuSK antibodies generally do not. Recently, the selective AChEI EN101, which specifically targets the isoform of "read-through" AChE (AChE-R), has been developed and may be of importance for symptomatic relief in AChR-antibody seropositive MG. This article is a review of the mechanisms, therapeutic effects, and drawbacks, with both old and new AChEIs in MG.

### AChR-myasthenia gravis switching to double-seropositive several years after the onset [^117Da6AJ]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2014). Low credibility.

We report an early onset AChR-myasthenia gravis (MG) with biphasic clinical course. The clinical "switch" from AChR-MG to MuSK-MG emerged 16 years after the onset and 11 years after thymectomy. MuSK antibodies were detected only by cell-based assay and only upon clinical "switch", while AChR antibodies remained positive and at high titers during the whole disease course. Although the occurrence of AChR antibodies and MuSK antibodies in the same individual is rare, the re-assessment of the antibody status, using all available assays, is advisable when there is clinical indication.

### Subgroup stratification and outcome in recently diagnosed generalized myasthenia gravis [^1147gcXY]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe disease outcomes of myasthenia gravis (MG) subgroups and which factors influence outcomes by reviewing individual patient records of a representative cohort.

Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis of 199 patients with generalized MG and disease onset after the year 2000 who were treated at 2 tertiary referral centers in Austria. We stratified patients as early- and late-onset acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive, muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibody-positive, and seronegative patients and patients with thymoma regardless of antibody status. We evaluated patients' symptom severity and treatment regimens and the occurrence of life-threatening events at yearly time points for up to 10 years.

Results

Minimal manifestation status or better was eventually achieved and sustained for > 1 year by 125 (63%) patients. Forty percent (66 of 165 patients) showed an early response to treatment, which predicted a benign disease course later on. In contrast, 19% of patients, who remained symptomatic for 2 years after disease onset despite immunosuppressive therapy, were more treatment resistant in the following years. The strongest predictor of outcome was the diagnostic subgroup. Patients with MuSK-MG had a much better outcome than previously reported.

Conclusion

Our data give an update on the disease course of generalized MG in the new century. Diagnostic subgroups and response to treatment within the first 2 years help to predict the long term outcome.

Introduction

Myasthenia gravis (MG) has an incidence of 4.1–30 cases per million person-years and a prevalence of 150–200 per million adults worldwide. In MG, activation of T cells and B cells specific to the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) results in antibody-related impairment of AChR signalling at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Patients with MG experience fatigable weakness of the ocular muscles (ptosis, diplopia), bulbar muscles (dysphagia, dysphonia, dysarthria, chewing difficulty) and limb musclesresulting in lower mental and physical health-related quality of life relative to the general population. The burden of disease includes its impact on economic, social and emotional well-being.

Common treatment approaches to MG include steroids and immunosuppressive therapies. Pyridostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, is the recommended initial treatment especially if symptoms are mild. That said, many patients will inevitably require corticosteroids or broad-acting immunosuppressants (ie, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil). Current therapies are associated with possible significant side effects including gastrointestinal upset, increased risk of infection and liver damage along with weight gain, elevated blood sugars, bone loss and Cushing syndrome as with chronic steroid use. Plasma exchange (PLEX) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) are typically considered short-term therapies and used for myasthenic crisis or exacerbation. Patients may also undergo thymectomy to help reduce medication use and disease severity but this is not curative. Complement inhibitors (ie, eculizumab) or neonatal FC receptor inhibitors (ie, efgartigimod) which target downstream immunopathology are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for the treatment of AChR antibody-positive generalised MG. Currently available new agents require frequent/chronic intravenous or subcutaneous dosing and increase the risk of infection. There are no proven therapies that target the root cause of MG, antigen-specific T cell-dependent B cell-mediated autoimmunity leading to postsynaptic NMJ destruction via pathogenic antibodies. Induction of immune tolerance remains the holy grail for the treatment of autoimmune disorders.
