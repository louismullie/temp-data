## Question

what assessment and pain management are recommended for back pain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evidence-based assessment and pain management recommendations for low back pain, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to structure the clinical flow from initial assessment through treatment and follow-up. Then, I should verify the key assessment elements, including red flags, neurologic deficits, psychosocial risk, and when to image. Next, I will review first-line nonpharmacologic therapies and their evidence strength. After that, I should examine pharmacologic options, including NSAIDs, duloxetine, and the cautious role of opioids. Finally, I will consider special populations, monitoring and escalation, and synthesize a practical algorithm that aligns with major guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the overarching clinical framework so I don't miss anything important. The VA/DoD algorithm provides a strong backbone: screen for red flags and neurologic deficits, initiate treatment, reassess response, escalate or pivot if not improved, and avoid routine imaging unless indicated, which is echoed by AAFP and ACP guidance emphasizing nonpharmacologic care first and selective imaging only when red flags or persistent deficits are present [^113164ey] [^112kienb] [^111izsd2].

> I need to check the initial assessment elements carefully. History and exam should explicitly evaluate for progressive or serious neurologic deficits and red flags such as malignancy, infection, or fracture. If present, pursue targeted diagnostics and consider specialty referral, whereas routine imaging is not recommended for uncomplicated axial low back pain without these features, and this is a strong recommendation in VA/DoD and AAFP guidance [^115nLv8W] [^1165KgWy] [^111izsd2]. Wait, let me verify the psychosocial piece: multiple high-quality sources recommend assessing psychosocial and workplace factors to predict risk of chronicity and guide early intervention, which I should integrate into baseline planning rather than deferring it [^111XsX9a] [^11413PhG].

> Next, I should review how to classify pain and risk-stratify. Duration categories of acute, subacute, and chronic remain standard, and I should confirm that most low back pain is nonspecific and that classification systems can help match treatments but have not consistently outperformed usual care. Still, approaches like MDT or impairment-based classification can be reasonable when applied thoughtfully and re-evaluated over time [^115XcvMN] [^114tXDmA] [^112GNLAE]. Hold on, I should verify prognostic tools: the Keele STarT Back tool is supported for stratifying risk and guiding stepped care intensity, which can shape early referral to multidisciplinary programs for high-risk patients [^111YhYd1].

> Now, I will examine first-line nonpharmacologic therapies because guidelines consistently prioritize them. Exercise is foundational for chronic low back pain, with no clear superiority of one modality over another in head-to-head comparisons, so I should tailor to patient preference and capacity while ensuring progressive loading and adherence; APA also strongly recommends CBT across time horizons for chronic musculoskeletal pain, and manual therapy can offer short-term benefits in acute presentations, while education should be active and biopsychosocial rather than passive [^116mjUJE] [^116DyMJW] [^111C1xMQ] [^114Rh3vL]. Wait, I almost said traction helps radicular pain; I should double-check that — current evidence does not support traction for chronic low back pain with leg pain, so I should not recommend it [^112sL7UG].

> Let me consider pharmacologic options and their hierarchy. NSAIDs are first-line when medication is desired for acute, subacute, or chronic low back pain, with AAFP and ACP endorsing their use and balancing GI, renal, and cardiovascular risks. Duloxetine is a reasonable second-line option for chronic pain, particularly with coexisting mood symptoms, and acetaminophen has limited or no benefit and should not be relied upon as monotherapy for chronic low back pain despite older guidance suggesting it as a first-line option [^111upJXW] [^116GQ8q6] [^111izsd2]. I should confirm opioid positioning: major guidelines advise against initial opioid therapy; if considered at all for refractory chronic low back pain after nonpharmacologic and NSAID failure, use the lowest effective dose with close monitoring, and prefer weak opioids like tramadol only after shared decision-making that weighs modest benefits against meaningful harms, including overdose and misuse risk [^112F4BA9] [^115UsGuX] [^111yt792].

> But wait, what about special populations and contexts. For older adults, I need to ensure fall-risk mitigation with any centrally acting agents and prefer topical NSAIDs when feasible. For patients with high psychosocial risk, early CBT and multidisciplinary rehabilitation are prudent. For workers, early, gradual return-to-work with modifications should be encouraged and supported. And for patients with lifestyle risks, integrating healthy lifestyle support into usual care may yield small but meaningful improvements in disability without replacing core treatments [^111s2W7y] [^112YwFFJ] [^1151Rjpd]. I should also remember that technology-based self-management has insufficient evidence for routine recommendation, so I won't overpromise digital tools at this time [^111xqSvp].

> I will now examine monitoring and escalation so I don't miss a pivot point. Reassessment at about 2–4 weeks to verify pain and function response is reasonable; if there is inadequate improvement, I should verify adherence, intensify nonpharmacologic therapy, consider adding duloxetine or a short NSAID course if not already used, and reassess for new red flags or neurologic changes; persistent functional deficits or high-risk profiles should trigger referral to multidisciplinary programs, and only a minority with refractory, well-selected structural indications should proceed to interventional or surgical evaluation [^113164ey] [^115FWkEK] [^111izsd2]. Hold on, I should verify that epidural steroids are not broadly indicated; they are not recommended for axial chronic low back pain and may be considered only for short-term radicular symptom relief in select cases, which aligns with AAFP guidance [^111izsd2].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm while keeping it reference-aligned. Start with focused history and exam to exclude red flags and serious neurologic deficits, assess psychosocial risks, and classify duration. Provide reassurance and active self-management advice while avoiding bed rest. Initiate nonpharmacologic therapy such as supervised exercise, CBT when indicated, and manual therapy for short-term relief in acute cases. Reassess in 2–4 weeks. If improved, continue and titrate. If not improved, add NSAIDs or duloxetine as appropriate and escalate nonpharmacologic intensity. If still refractory and high risk, refer for multidisciplinary rehabilitation. Reserve opioids as a last resort with strict safeguards, and use imaging or specialty referral only for evolving deficits, suspected serious pathology, or failure of appropriate conservative care over the recommended timeframe [^113164ey] [^112kienb] [^1165KgWy] [^112F4BA9].

> Finally, I should confirm that my recommendations reflect the strength of evidence and guideline consensus. Nonpharmacologic care remains first-line across high-quality guidelines, NSAIDs are the preferred initial medication when needed, and opioids are not first-line due to limited long-term benefit and substantial harms. Shared decision-making, risk stratification, and timely reassessment are the glue that holds this approach together and help align treatment with patient goals and safety [^112kienb] [^116GQ8q6] [^115UsGuX].

Back pain assessment should start with a **focused history and exam** to identify red flags, neurologic deficits, and psychosocial risk factors [^115nLv8W] [^1165KgWy]. Routine imaging is not recommended unless red flags or persistent neurologic deficits are present [^1165KgWy] [^111izsd2]. For pain management, **nonpharmacologic care is first-line** [^112kienb] — including exercise, physical therapy, CBT, and mindfulness — with NSAIDs as the initial medication if needed [^111upJXW] [^116GQ8q6]. Opioids are not first-line and should be reserved for refractory cases after careful risk–benefit assessment [^112F4BA9] [^115CtpDo]. Management should be individualized, with regular reassessment and escalation only if there is inadequate response [^113164ey].

- **Pain characteristics**: Location, intensity (0–10 scale), quality, aggravating/relieving factors [^114ghWN6].
- **Associated symptoms**: Leg pain, numbness, weakness, bowel/bladder changes, fever, weight loss [^notfound].
- **Red flags**: Cancer, infection, fracture, cauda equina syndrome [^115nLv8W].
- **Yellow flags**: Psychosocial factors, fear-avoidance, depression, anxiety, work-related stress [^113mFVUj] [^11413PhG].

---

### Physical examination

Obtain imaging when **red flags** are present, there are progressive or serious neurologic deficits, or pain persists beyond 6 weeks despite conservative therapy [^1165KgWy] [^111izsd2]. MRI is preferred for suspected **serious pathology** or radiculopathy; X-ray is reserved for suspected fracture or degenerative changes [^notfound].

---

## Pain management strategies

### Nonpharmacologic interventions (first-line)

- **Exercise therapy**: Supervised or home-based programs, including aerobic, strength, flexibility, and core stabilization exercises [^116mjUJE] [^112B95CK].
- **Physical therapy**: Manual therapy, joint mobilization, and patient education [^111C1xMQ] [^114Rh3vL].
- **Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)**: Strongly recommended for chronic low back pain [^116DyMJW] [^115767Hx].
- **Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR)**: Effective for chronic pain management [^115767Hx].
- **Acupuncture**: Consider for chronic pain relief [^1144jTXr] [^111izsd2].
- **Spinal manipulation**: Small, short-term benefits for acute and chronic pain [^112B6L1G] [^1144jTXr].

---

### Pharmacologic interventions (second-line)

- **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)**: First-line pharmacotherapy for acute and chronic low back pain [^111upJXW] [^116GQ8q6].
- **Acetaminophen**: Alternative for patients who cannot tolerate NSAIDs [^notfound].
- **Duloxetine**: Recommended for chronic low back pain, especially with comorbid depression or anxiety [^111upJXW] [^111izsd2].
- **Muscle relaxants**: Short-term use for acute pain with muscle spasm [^notfound].
- **Opioids**: Not recommended as first-line therapy; consider only for refractory cases after careful risk–benefit assessment and close monitoring [^112F4BA9] [^115UsGuX].

---

### Interventional procedures

Interventional options include **epidural steroid injections** for short-term relief in radicular pain [^111izsd2] and facet joint injections for chronic facet-mediated pain. Spinal cord stimulation is considered for refractory chronic pain after conservative measures have failed.

---

### Surgical interventions

Surgery is reserved for patients with **persistent functional disability** despite conservative care, or when there is progressive neurologic deficit or structural instability [^111izsd2]. Common procedures include lumbar decompression, discectomy, and spinal fusion [^114mHTFq].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up should assess **pain, function, and psychosocial factors**, with treatment adjusted based on response and patient preferences [^115LTKzg]. Patient education should emphasize self-management, activity, and realistic expectations [^114Rh3vL]. Multidisciplinary care involving primary care, physical therapy, psychology, and pain specialists is recommended for chronic or complex cases [^113164ey].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Intervention** | **Recommendation** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Exercise therapy | Strongly recommended | High |
| CBT | Strongly recommended | High |
| NSAIDs | First-line pharmacotherapy | High |
| Duloxetine | Recommended for chronic pain | Moderate |
| Opioids | Not first-line; use cautiously | High |
| imaging | Only if red flags or persistent symptoms | High |
| surgery | Reserved for specific indications | High |

---

Effective back pain management requires a **comprehensive assessment** to identify red and yellow flags, with **nonpharmacologic interventions as first-line** and pharmacologic therapy reserved for refractory cases. Regular follow-up, patient education, and multidisciplinary care are essential for optimal outcomes.

### The need for multidimensional stratification of chronic low back pain (LBP) [^111YhYd1]. Spine (2017). Low credibility.

Low back pain (LBP) is currently ranked as the single leading cause of years lived with disability worldwide. Despite extensive study and numerous clinical practice guidelines, treatment costs for LBP continue to increase without improvement in functional outcomes. In the US, the annual expenditure related to LBP ($86 billion) has reached levels comparable to the care of diabetes ($98 billion), cancer ($89 billion), and nonspine arthritis ($80 billion).

Although many acute episodes of LBP resolve, substantial numbers of patients suffer repeated relapses requiring treatment. A recent review reported that 75% of patients experiencing an episode of LBP continue to report pain at 6 weeks (subacute phase), and 66% continue to report pain at 3 months (chronic phase). Up to 25% of LBP persists in a constant, chronic state and incurs the largest costs (approximately 75%) in terms of health care utilization and loss of productivity.

At the primary care level, most current clinical practice guidelines dichotomize LBP patients to those with specific LBP (a small group with easily identifiable pain source, e.g. infection) or with implied mechanical or "non-specific" LBP (a large group, > 80%). Patients with nonspecific LBP are heterogeneous in terms of clinical characteristics and prognosis, and thus are more likely to respond favorably to specific treatment, rather than the current "one-size-fits-all" approach. Evidence warranting moderate to low confidence suggests that a more specific approach to management leads to tailored treatments (i.e. stratified management) and improved outcomes. – Using a classification system based on mechanical patterns of symptom dominance and stratified management, Hall et al.found improved clinical outcomes compared with nonspecific management in an observational study. Results of a randomized control trial conducted in the UK suggests that stratified management based on psychosocial factors, using the Keele STarT Back Screening Tool (SBST) that separates LBP patients into low, moderate, and high-risk groups for persistent disabling back pain, is cost-effective compared with usual care. Recently, a National Institutes of Health Pain Consortium charged a Research Task Force to draft standards for research on chronic LBP. Their recommendations were for stratification by severity of pain and disability.

### Low back pain [^116MmT2N]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Low back pain is a common problem that is the leading cause of disability and is associated with high costs. Evaluation focuses on identification of risk factors indicating a serious underlying condition and increased risk for persistent disabling symptoms in order to guide selective use of diagnostic testing (including imaging) and treatments. Nonpharmacologic therapies, including exercise and psychosocial management, are preferred for most patients with low back pain and may be supplemented with adjunctive drug therapies. Surgery and interventional procedures are options in a minority of patients who do not respond to standard treatments.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis protocol on how best to use non-pharmacologic therapies to manage chronic low back pain and associated depression [^114iWrWA]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Confidence Assessment

Two independent reviewers (YG and YQM) will utilize the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework to evaluate the overall quality of evidence. The strength of evidence will be judged as "high" (further research is unlikely to change our conclusion), "moderate" (further research is likely to alter our conclusion), or "low" and "very low" (further studies are required to answer the research question with a high degree of confidence/increase confidence) on the basis of limitations in study design and implementation, unexplained heterogeneity or inconsistency of effect results, indirectness of evidence, inaccuracies in the results, and a high probability of publication bias. These assessments will be cross-checked by two reviewers (YG and YQM) and will be generated in GRADEprofiler (GRADEpro) version 3.6.1 (Evidence Prime, Ontario, Canada). Any discrepancy will be resolved by consensus or consultation with a third reviewer (XZ).

Ethical Considerations

This study is being conducted using systematic review and meta-analysis methods with existing trial data. Since no private and confidential patient data will be contained in the reporting, there are no ethical considerations associated with this protocol.

### Occupational health guidelines for the management of low back pain: an international comparison [^111s2W7y]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The enormous socioeconomic burden of low back pain emphasises the need for effective management of this problem, especially in an occupational context. To address this, occupational guidelines have been issued in various countries.

Aims

To compare available international guidelines dealing with the management of low back pain in an occupational health care setting.

Methods

The guidelines were compared regarding generally accepted quality criteria using the AGREE instrument, and also summarised regarding the guideline committee, the presentation, the target group, and assessment and management recommendations (that is, advice, return to work strategy, and treatment).

Results

and

Conclusions

The results show that the quality criteria were variously met by the guidelines. Common flaws concerned the absence of proper external reviewing in the development process, lack of attention to organisational barriers and cost implications, and lack of information on the extent to which editors and developers were independent. There was general agreement on numerous issues fundamental to occupational health management of back pain. The assessment recommendations consisted of diagnostic triage, screening for "red flags" and neurological problems, and the identification of potential psychosocial and workplace barriers for recovery. The guidelines also agreed on advice that low back pain is a self limiting condition and, importantly, that remaining at work or an early (gradual) return to work, if necessary with modified duties, should be encouraged and supported.

### Classifying nonspecific low back pain for better clinical outcomes: current challenges and paths forward [^114DAi62]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

SYNOPSIS: Low back pain classification systems are structured assessments used to guide choices of more specific treatments. Classification systems examined in randomized controlled trials have limited effects on pain intensity and disability compared to nonclassified interventions. Potential reasons for the lack of efficacy include (1) failing to assess multidimensional factors that contribute to pain, (2) relying on clinician judgement, (3) low accessibility, and (4) poor classification reliability. Overcoming these limitations is critical to deciding whether classification systems can improve clinical practice. Only once these limitations are addressed, can we feel certain about the efficacy, or lack thereof, of classification systems. This Viewpoint guides the reader through some limitations of common classification approaches and presents a path forward to open-access, reliable, and multidimensional precision medicine for managing low back pain.

### Interventions for the management of acute and chronic low back pain: revision 2021 [^112GNLAE]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2021). High credibility.

Key points for classification systems — there is no evidence directly comparing the effectiveness of different classification systems for patients with acute low back pain (LBP). For chronic LBP, some evidence supports the notion that treatments informed by MDT, CFT, prognostic risk stratification, and pathoanatomic-based classification lead to reduced pain and disability, and no evidence exists to support the notion that treatment informed by any single classification system is more effective than another for reducing pain and disability in patients with chronic LBP.

### Current perspectives on the assessment and management of pain in the intensive care unit [^114QuEf2]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

ICU Pain Management

Appropriate assessment of pain must be partnered with an adequate, multi-modal, and evidence-based management strategy. This multi-modal strategy should incorporate both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic modalities of pain control. The recommended approach is to employ an inclusive assessment and management protocol, which directs recommended pain management strategies based on pain scores. In this section, we will discuss currently recommended pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic pain management strategies.

Non-Pharmacologic Management

There have been several non-pharmacologic methods that have gained increasing evidence over the last several years. The SCCM ICU Liberation Bundlerecommends four primary non-pharmacologic methods: massage therapy, cold therapy, music and sound, and relaxation therapy.

The goal of non-pharmacologic therapies is to address both physical sensory pain pathways (massage therapy, cold therapy) as well as the emotional, affective and cognitive elements of pain perception (music and sounds, relaxation therapy). A challenge in critically ill patients is in many cases they are unable to communicate their sensations, perceptions or emotions surrounding their pain. However, many of these methods have been shown to decrease both self-reported pain scores and behavioral pain assessments.

Massage Therapy

Massage therapy for ICU patients typically involves massage on the back, feet and/or hands. Depending on the patient's clinical status, hands-only massage is also acceptable. The ICU Liberation Bundle recommends at least 20 minutes of light pressure massage at least twice in a 24-hour period. Massage therapy, when done consistently, has been shown to reduce visual numeric pain scores by up to 2 points.

Massage is typically paired with decreasing sensory stimuli such as dimming lights and either muting alarms or decreasing the volume and providing earplugs or an eye mask to the patient. This is often seen as a barrier to implementation of a massage protocol, given frequent disruptions in an ICU setting. There have been no feasibility studies performed on the implementation of a massage protocol. The ICU Liberation Bundle recommends engagement of family members to participate in massage care with guidance from the nursing staff.

### Interventions for the management of acute and chronic low back pain: revision 2021 [^115csjPB]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2021). High credibility.

Low back pain — 2012 exercise recommendations: The 2012 recommendations were not divided by patient subgroup. Physical therapists should consider (1) moderate- to high-intensity exercise for patients with chronic low back pain (LBP) without generalized pain, and (2) incorporating progressive, low-intensity, submaximal fitness and endurance activities into pain management and health promotion strategies for patients with chronic LBP with generalized pain. Physical therapists should consider utilizing trunk coordination, strengthening, and endurance exercises to reduce LBP and disability in patients with subacute and chronic LBP with movement coordination impairments and in patients post lumbar microdiscectomy. Physical therapists should consider utilizing repeated movements, exercises, or procedures to promote centralization to reduce symptoms in patients with acute LBP with related (referred) lower extremity pain, and should consider using repeated exercises in a specific direction determined by treatment response to improve mobility and reduce symptoms in patients with acute, subacute, or chronic LBP with mobility deficits.

### Evidence and consensus recommendations for the pharmacological management of pain in India [^1126cMeL]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Despite enormous progress in the field of pain management over the recent years, pain continues to be a highly prevalent medical condition worldwide. In the developing countries, pain is often an undertreated and neglected aspect of treatment. Awareness issues and several misconceptions associated with the use of analgesics, fear of adverse events – particularly with opioids and surgical methods of analgesia – are major factors contributing to suboptimal treatment of pain. Untreated pain, as a consequence, is associated with disability, loss of income, unemployment and considerable mortality; besides contributing majorly to the economic burden on the society and the health care system in general. Available guidelines suggest that a strategic treatment approach may be helpful for physicians in managing pain in real-world settings. The aim of this manuscript is to propose treatment recommendations for the management of different types of pain, based on the available evidence. Evidence search was performed by using MEDLINE (by PubMed) and Cochrane databases. The types of articles included in this review were based on randomized control studies, case–control or cohort studies, prospective and retrospective studies, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, clinical practice guidelines and evidence-based consensus recommendations. Articles were reviewed by a multidisciplinary expert panel and recommendations were developed. A stepwise treatment algorithm-based approach based on a careful diagnosis and evaluation of the underlying disease, associated comorbidities and type/duration of pain is proposed to assist general practitioners, physicians and pain specialists in clinical decision making.

### MMWR… [^115UsGuX]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

The recommendations do not apply to pain related to sickle cell disease or cancer or to patients receiving palliative or end-of-life care. The guideline addresses the following four areas: 1) determining whether or not to initiate opioids for pain, 2) selecting opioids and determining opioid dosages, 3) deciding duration of initial opioid prescription and conducting follow-up, and 4) assessing risk and addressing potential harms of opioid use. CDC recommends that persons with pain receive appropriate pain treatment, with careful consideration of the benefits and risks of all treatment options in the context of the patient's circumstances. Recommendations should not be applied as inflexible standards of care across patient populations.

This clinical practice guideline is intended to improve communication between clinicians and patients about the benefits and risks of pain treatments, including opioid therapy; improve the effectiveness and safety of pain treatment; mitigate pain; improve function and quality of life for patients with pain; and reduce risks associated with opioid pain therapy, including opioid use disorder, overdose, and death. *. The limited evidence of long-term effectiveness of opioids for chronic pain, coupled with risks to patients and to persons using prescription opioids that were not prescribed to them, underscored the importance of reducing inappropriate opioid prescribing while advancing evidence-based pain care to improve the lives of persons living with pain. CDC recognized the need for a national guideline on pain management that could improve appropriate opioid prescribing while minimizing opioid-related risks and released the.

Additional insights from patients, caregivers, and clinicians shared during virtual conversations held in 2020 were incorporated in the update. Importantly, to discourage the misapplication of opioid pain medication dosage thresholds as inflexible standards, revised recommendation statement language emphasizes principles such as avoiding increasing dosage above levels likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits relative to risks to patients. More-specific considerations related to dosage have been moved to implementation considerations that follow each recommendation statement, where more nuance is offered to inform clinical decision-making and individualized patient care. In addition to updating recommendations on the basis of new evidence regarding management of chronic pain, this clinical practice guideline is intended to assist clinicians in weighing benefits and risks of prescribing opioid pain medication for painful acute conditions and pain related to procedures. In 2020, several of these indications were prioritized by an ad hoc committee of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (.

### Evidence and consensus recommendations for the pharmacological management of pain in India [^114ghWN6]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Management recommendations

General considerations (evaluating a patient with pain)

The recommendations are based on graded evidence as explained previously. The grades are mentioned in parenthesis next to each recommendation.

History

A thorough evaluation of the patient profile, patient history and presence of comorbid conditions is necessary as a first step toward pain diagnosis (C).
Diagnosis should involve measurement of pain intensity, physical examination, sensory examination, motor examination and evaluation of cognitive and functional well-being (B).

Assessment and monitoring

Identify and use appropriate pain assessment tools (A) For the purpose of designing treatment strategies for managing pain, it is essential to assess the severity of the pain. Use of pain assessment scales may help in the diagnosis of the disease, design of treatment strategies, monitoring and evaluation of outcome of therapy or for predicting the impact of pain on functional outcomes of a patient (Table 3). Factors that should be taken into consideration while selecting the appropriate pain assessment method include sensitivity and specificity, usefulness or value of the assessment tool, objective of the assessment, age of the patient and extent of symptoms presented by the patient.
Sensory examination Components of a sensory examination include light touch, pinprick, temperature (hot or cold) and vibration. Quantitative sensory testing (QST) might help distinguish between various types of neuropathic pain. In patients with neuropathy, the threshold for pinprick and thermal sensations are increased, while increased sensitivity to light touch may indicate presence of allodynia or hyperalgesia, which may point toward painful inflammation or fibromyalgia with a central neuropathic origin.–The QST has also been used in the diagnosis of osteoarthritis and other musculoskeletal conditions, although not as a sole measure.
Motor examination Evaluation of motor function is an important method of diagnosing musculoskeletal pain, especially back pain and neck pain. Exercises such as neck rotation and neck flexion or extension tests may help determine the localization and intensity of pain (D).
Diagnostic tests Examination by X-rays is the most common method used to confirm the localization of pain, particularly in LBP, neck pain, joint pain or pain associated with internal organs. Use of computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) might be useful in cases in which diagnosis by physical examination or X-ray may be insufficient or if any underlying damage to the CNS is suspected to be involved. Further details are presented in the Supplementary material section.

### Rehabilitation management of low back pain-it's time to pull it all together! [^11548Bu8]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Non-specific low back pain (LBP) is defined as "a symptom for which we are currently unable to reliably identify the pathology". This painful musculoskeletal problem is highly prevalent and recurrent in nature: the lifetime prevalence is estimated to be 84%, and ~55% of patients will have at least 10 episodes in their lifetime. With a point prevalence of ~25%, chronic LBP is a major health burden and is ranked as the most disabling pathology with respect to global burden of disease. In terms of disability adjusted life-years, LBP is the leading cause of years lived with disability in both developed and developing countries.

Despite an intense focus and increased research funding, the self-reported levels of disability in individuals with LBP have not improved in the last decade. This situation prevails, notwithstanding the presence of multiple monodisciplinary classification tools designed to target patient-specific treatments, the presence of 15 international multidisciplinary guidelines for treatment of LBP, and the publication of numerous systematic reviews/meta-analyses on LBP. Each of these tools is designed to aid the clinical provider in identifying an optimal diagnosis and treatment approach, but it is likely that each has inherent limitations that fail to provide proper aid when dealing with the multidimensional complexities associated with LBP. For example, monodisciplinary (ie, physiotherapy) classification tools–often focus on diagnosis and interventional measures solely for cases that involve pathoanatomical nociceptive presentations. Guidelines and systematic reviews/meta-analyses typically provide evidence for only discreet interventions. Clinical pathways of care, which are mainly derived from guidelines, might propose more comprehensive solutions to merge real-life clinical care with best practice. Recently, clinical care pathways have been proposed,–yet their foci remain limited to the same specific biomechanical and psychological features found in LBP guidelines.

Update on the research evidence

Recommendations on treatments for acute and chronic spinal pain are published elsewhere in numerous reviews and clinical guidelines. We emphasize that guidelines seldom offer a full account of either 1) exactly how each recommended treatment should be applied, or 2) if a specific combination of these treatments would be more useful than another. In this regard, more recent research is showing that treatments previously believed to be equivocal are now emerging as clearly beneficial. For example, in a randomized controlled trial testing guidelines-based care, Bishop et alshowed that significantly greater improvement for acute mechanical low back pain of 16 weeks, or less, was achieved with spinal manipulative therapy compared with usual medical care. Patients receiving usual medical care had inferior functional outcomes in conjunction with higher rates of prescribed opioid analgesics (80%). The COST B13 European guidelinesdifferentiate between supporting the use of weak opioids (eg, tramadol), for acute and chronic back pain, and do not mention strong opioids for acute back pain. The COST B13 guideline indeed comments on the limited evidence for strong opioids in chronic back pain.

There is strong evidence that weak opioids (eg, tramadol) relieve pain and disability in the short-term in chronic low back pain patients (level A). There is limited evidence that strong opioids relieve pain in the short-term in chronic low back pain patients (level C).

Furthermore, medically managed patients received a high percentage (60%) of guideline-discordant treatment, like bed rest, X-rays, and back supports. Goertz et aldemonstrated that spinal manipulative therapy in conjunction with standard medical care offers a significant advantage for decreasing pain and improving physical functioning when compared with standard care alone for men and women between 18 and 35 years of age with acute low back pain. In contrast, Hay et alshowed that a brief pain management program for back pain delivered by appropriately trained clinicians offers an alternative to physiotherapy-incorporating manual therapy and could provide an efficient first-line approach for subacute low back pain in primary care. The inferences from these trials–are that there are various effective treatments for nonmalignant spinal pain, and that a multimodal approach, combining interventions, is likely to yield better outcomes – in this case patient education with both active and passive treatments. Such studies, among others, also firmly support the early access of patients with nonmalignant spinal pain to assessment, with an emphasis on triage and diagnosis, and appropriate treatment, to achieve the best possible outcome.–

### Clinical practice guidelines for the management of non-specific low back pain in primary care: an updated overview [^115FWkEK]. European Spine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to provide an overview of the recommendations regarding the diagnosis and treatment contained in current clinical practice guidelines for patients with non-specific low back pain in primary care. We also aimed to examine how recommendations have changed since our last overview in 2010.

Method

The searches for clinical practice guidelines were performed for the period from 2008 to 2017 in electronic databases. Guidelines including information regarding either the diagnosis or treatment of non-specific low back pain, and targeted at a multidisciplinary audience in the primary care setting, were considered eligible. We extracted data regarding recommendations for diagnosis and treatment, and methods for development of guidelines.

Results

We identified 15 clinical practice guidelines for the management of low back pain in primary care. For diagnosis of patients with non-specific low back pain, the clinical practice guidelines recommend history taking and physical examination to identify red flags, neurological testing to identify radicular syndrome, use of imaging if serious pathology is suspected (but discourage routine use), and assessment of psychosocial factors. For treatment of patients with acute low back pain, the guidelines recommend reassurance on the favourable prognosis and advice on returning to normal activities, avoiding bed rest, the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and weak opioids for short periods. For treatment of patients with chronic low back pain, the guidelines recommend the use of NSAIDs and antidepressants, exercise therapy, and psychosocial interventions. In addition, referral to a specialist is recommended in case of suspicion of specific pathologies or radiculopathy or if there is no improvement after 4 weeks. While there were a few discrepancies across the current clinical practice guidelines, a substantial proportion of recommendations was consistently endorsed. In the current review, we identified some differences compared to the previous overview regarding the recommendations for assessment of psychosocial factors, the use of some medications (e.g., paracetamol) as well as an increasing amount of information regarding the types of exercise, mode of delivery, acupuncture, herbal medicines, and invasive treatments.

### Management of chronic low back pain [^112n8UeX]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic low back pain is common. It presents a clinical challenge with widespread implications for resource utilization on a national scale. The causes of chronic low back pain may be mechanical or nonmechanical, nociceptive or neuropathic. Diagnosis is problematic because available tools lack both specificity and sensitivity. In rare instances, the cause of chronic low back pain can be attributed to an identified cause. Comprehensive pain management relies on the use of pharmacotherapy, physical therapy, and a multidisciplinary approach to treatment. Recent studies have shown a benefit for traditional adjunctive therapies and interdisciplinary treatment. Antidepressants and opioids have been and remain key elements for medical management, and some recently developed therapies have shown promising results in clinical trials. The following article presents an overview of evidence-based management for chronic low back pain, with an emphasis on pharmaceutical therapies.

For patients with low back pain, we suggest performing a mental health screening as part of the low back pain evaluation and taking results into consideration during selection of treatment. For patients with acute axial low back pain (i.e., localized, non-radiating), we recommend against routinely obtaining imaging studies or invasive diagnostic tests. For patients with low back pain, we recommend diagnostic imaging and appropriate laboratory testing when neurologic deficits are serious or progressive or when red flag symptoms are present.

Abstract

Low back pain is a significant issue in the US Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense populations as well as the general US population at large. This type of pain can be distressing to those who experience its effects, leading patients to seek relief of their symptoms. In 2022, leadership within the US Department of Veterans Affairs and US Department of Defense approved a joint clinical practice guideline for the management of low back pain. The guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for assessing and managing low back pain. Development of the guideline included a systematic evidence review, which was guided by 12 key questions. A multidisciplinary team, which included clinical stakeholders, reviewed the evidence that was retrieved and developed 39 recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system. The scope of the clinical practice guideline is broad; however, the authors have focused on key recommendations that are important for clinicians in the evaluation and nonoperative treatment of low back pain, including pharmacologic therapies and both noninvasive and invasive nonpharmacologic treatments.

Module A: Initial evaluation of low back pain (LBP) begins with an adult patient with LBP and directs clinicians to perform a focused history and physical examination evaluating duration of symptoms, red flags for potentially serious conditions, presence and severity of radiculopathy and/or neurologic deficits, and psychosocial risk factors (see Recommendation 4). If there are progressive or otherwise serious neurologic deficits or other red flags (e.g., signs, symptoms, history) for serious conditions (see Sidebars 1 and 2), perform appropriate evaluation for serious conditions (see Sidebar 1 and Recommendations 1–3); if serious conditions are identified, address any serious conditions as indicated and consider specialty consultation. If back pain is chronic (≥ 3 months), assess whether the patient has had appropriate treatment; if yes, go to Module B, Box 18 (assess treatment response), and if no, go to Module B, Box 18 (assess treatment response). If not chronic, engage the patient in a shared decision making process to develop an individualized care plan: advise about self-care, discuss noninvasive treatment options (pharmacologic, non-pharmacologic, watchful waiting), and arrive at a shared decision regarding treatment. If the patient chose pharmacologic and/or non-pharmacologic treatment, determine if the patient is on treatment; if yes, go to Module B, Box 18 (assess treatment response), and if no, go to Module B, Box 16 (untreated LBP). If the patient did not choose treatment, continue self-care and reassess in primary care as appropriate.

Module B: Management of Low Back Pain presents an algorithm that begins with an "LBP patient not on treatment", then to "Initiate treatment (see Sidebar 3)" and "Assess response as appropriate". If the question "Was the back pain improved or resolved?" is answered yes, the pathway directs "Continue self-care; reassess as appropriate". If not, assess for the question, "Are there progressive or otherwise serious neurologic deficits or other red flags (e.g., signs, symptoms, history) for serious conditions? (see Sidebars 1 and 2)"; if present, "Perform appropriate evaluation for serious conditions (see Sidebar 1 and Recommendations 1–3)". When asked "Are serious conditions identified?", if yes, "Address any serious conditions as indicated; consider specialty consultation". If no serious condition is found, the algorithm asks "Are there functional deficits (e.g., significant impairment of social, occupational, or educational function)?", and if yes, "Consider a multidisciplinary or interdisciplinary program, or refer to specialist". If functional deficits are absent, "Consider changing pharmacologic and/or non-pharmacologic interventions (if patient is on opioids, see VA/DoD Opioids CPGa)".

### Management of chronic low back pain in 2007–2008 [^116xXuSy]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To report and critically appraise the current state of managing chronic (and subacute) low back pain as reflected in recently published guidelines and results from latest trials.

Recent Findings

Although occurrence rates of and social benefits for back pain are apparently on the decline (at least in Germany), it is still one of the most frequent and costly health disorders in Western countries. Ten percent of the adult German population suffers from chronic disabling back pain. For this group, a plethora of interventions is recommended. The most recent guideline from the US alone enumerates eight different treatments based on 'moderate-quality evidence'. Latest (often high-quality) trials from 2006 to 2007 strengthen the evidence base, only modestly, owing to their conflicting and/or confusing results.

Summary

Recommendations for the management of chronic disabling nonspecific back pain have made little progress over the past 10 years. The field still suffers from a 'strong weakness' due to a generally weak body of evidence. Progress can be expected when the effects of an intervention can be reliably calibrated against comparators of known (in)effectiveness. At present, an individualized clinical approach seems most appropriate. Patients and doctors are free to choose, according to their experiences and preferences, from recommended treatments.

Risk of bias assessment and GRADE

Risk of bias for each individual study was assessed independently by PJO and ST using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool, which examined potential selection bias (random sequence generation and allocation concealment), performance bias (blinding of patients and personnel), detection bias (blinding of outcome assessment), attrition bias (incomplete outcome data), reporting bias (selective outcome reporting) and other bias. For each source of bias, studies were classified as having a low, high or unclear (if reporting was not sufficient to assess a particular domain) risk. For example, studies that used a random approach to treatment allocation (eg, random number generator) were classified as low risk for this component of selection bias assessment, while those that did not use a random approach (eg, date of birth assignment) were classified as high risk. As this study involved exercise training interventions, it was not possible to blind patients to treatment allocation; thus, patient blinding was deemed as a high risk of bias for all studies and was not included in the overall risk of bias assessment of each study. All risk of bias disagreements were adjudicated by NLM. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the quality of the evidence behind the ranking of treatments from NMA.

Study Design

Systematic review.

Objective

To provide a detailed description of the methods undertaken in the systematic search and analytical summary of chronic low back pain (CLBP) management issues and to describe the process used to develop clinical recommendations regarding challenges in the management of patients with CLBP.

Summary Of Background Data

We present methods used in conducting the systematic, evidence-based reviews and development of expert panel recommendations on key challenges to CLBP assessment and management. Our intent is that clinicians will combine the information from these reviews with an understanding of their own capacities and experience to better manage patients with chronic LBP and to consider future research that identifies patients or subgroups that respond differently with regard to benefits and safety to various treatment interventions.

Methods

A systematic search and critical review of the English language literature was undertaken for articles published on the classification, measurement, and management of CLBP. Citations were screened for relevance using a priori criteria, and relevant studies were critically reviewed. Whether an article was included for review depended on whether the study question was descriptive, one of therapy, one of prognosis, or one of diagnosis. When evaluating differential treatment benefits by specific disease, sociodemographic, and psychological subgroups, we sought to evaluate the heterogeneity of treatment effects. Studies were included if they made the treatment comparison and presented treatment effects by the predefined subgroup. The strength of evidence for the overall body of literature in each topic area was determined by two independent reviewers considering risk of bias, consistency, directness, and precision of results using a modification of the Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. Findings from studies meeting inclusion criteria were summarized. From these summaries, clinical recommendations were formulated from consensus achieved among subject experts through a modified Delphi process.

Results

We identified and screened 2845 citations in 13 topic areas relating to the classification, measurement, and management of CLBP. Of these, 118 met our predetermined inclusion criteria and were used to attempt to answer specific clinical questions within each topic area. Some of the highlights of the analysis revealed a limited number of studies meeting inclusion criteria for topics evaluating therapy, use of magnetic resonance imaging, and classification systems. Few studies comparing surgical fusion to nonoperative care were identified that presented treatment effects by subgroups limiting the evaluation of heterogeneity of treatment effects.

Conclusion

We undertook systematic reviews to understand the classification, measurement, and management of CLBP and to provide clinical recommendations. This article reports the methods used in the reviews.

Clinical Recommendations

Clinical recommendations were made where appropriate using the GRADE/Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality approach, which imparts a deliberate separation between the quality of the evidence (i.e., high, moderate, low, or inconclusive) from the strength of the recommendation. The quality of evidence plays only a part as the strength of the recommendation reflects the extent to which we can, across the range of patients for whom the recommendations are intended, be confident that desirable effects of a management strategy outweigh undesirable effects.

### Healthy lifestyle care vs guideline-based care for low back pain: a randomized clinical trial [^1151Rjpd]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Low back pain is a leading cause of disability globally and a significant public health problem. Observational studies have linked the development and persistence of low back pain with lifestyle risk factors, such as being overweight, smoking, physical inactivity, and poor diet. Disability associated with back pain can also lead to compensatory unhealthy lifestyle behaviors, exposing people to increased risk of chronic diseases.

Despite associations between lifestyle risks and back pain, the effectiveness of targeting lifestyle to manage back pain is uncertain. Based on a recent systematic review of weight management interventions, the World Health Organization global guideline for low back pain does not recommend weight loss due to very-low-certainty evidence from small studies with high risk of bias. No trials of smoking interventions for back pain have been reported, and while exercise is considered a core treatment for low back pain, trials targeting sedentary lifestyle are lacking.

Internationally, integrated health care for people experiencing multiple health challenges is endorsed by governments and health policy, acknowledging the associations between chronic diseases and their determinants. Integrated care aims to support a person-centered approach to connect prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation actions, according to an individual's needs. Currently, there is limited evidence for the benefits of integrating lifestyle-focused support into low back pain care, and few people with these coexisting health challenges receive integrated care.

In response to knowledge gaps about integrated care for low back pain and unhealthy lifestyle, we designed the HeLP (Healthy Lifestyle Program) for Chronic Low Back Pain Trial. The HeLP trial aimed to assess the benefits and potential harms of integrating management of unhealthy lifestyle with guideline-based care on low back pain disability compared with current guideline-recommended care alone.

Domains and their operational definitions

The five domains included in the proposed model are aligned alongside drivers of pain and/or disability. As pain is the most often reported deficit/impairment in LBP, it is first important to accurately appraise the relative importance of pain and its effect on function (disability) with adopted and recognized tools, as the ones proposed by the Initiative on Methods, Measurements and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trial (IMMPACT). The IMMPACT group has proposed specific assessment tools for core outcome domains in chronic pain, which have been adopted by many stakeholders.

As an attempt to quantify the relative contribution (severity) of each domain of interest, the domains we have included in our model contain two categories, the first (A) implicates more common and/or modifiable elements, whereas the second (B) involves elements that are more complex, less modifiable, and that will prompt more aggressive or require interdisciplinary care to more effectively address the problematic domain. Although these domains can interact and their relative individual contribution to pain and disability can modulate through time, the model gives a structure upon which the clinician can base its assessment (patient profiling) and consequently better target treatments, while reflecting a true biopsychosocial approach, as embraced by the ICF. The visual representation of the model is presented in Figure 1.

Domain 1 – nociceptive pain drivers

Nociceptive pain is "pain that arises from actual or threatened damage to non-neural tissue and is due to the activation of nociceptors". The presence of nociceptive pain relates to the ICF as it is linked to deficits and impairments in body functions and structures. As the most frequent and primary driver of painful symptoms in cases of LBP result from the nociceptive system (somatic, inflammatory, or mixed pain), specific strategies to achieve pain control should initially target this driver of pain. This domain is composed of "responders to classification systems" (category A) and "non-responders to classification systems" (category B). Table 1 provides the operational definitions.

Methods

This narrative review synthesizes findings from peer-reviewed articles and clinical guidelines retrieved from PubMed. A comprehensive database search was conducted in May 2025 using the following keywords in the advanced search function: ("low back pain" OR "lumbar pain" OR "chronic back pain") AND ("treatment" OR "management" OR "intervention") AND ("cost effectiveness" OR "economic evaluation" OR "cost utility"). The inclusion criteria were: (1) articles published in English, (2) publication types limited to systematic reviews, original research articles, clinical studies, or randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and (3) studies published within the past 10 years (2015–2025). Exclusion criteria included editorials, opinion pieces, and conference abstracts.

A total of 397 articles were initially retrieved from the PubMed search. Following title and abstract screening, 83 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Of these, 28 studies met all inclusion criteria and were included in the final synthesis. The selected articles were manually reviewed for relevance, and data were extracted on the following parameters: type of LBP treatment, classification as pharmacological or non-pharmacological, and reported cost-effectiveness outcomes.

### Triage for nonspecific lower-back pain [^112QNZGQ]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2006). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Unremitting lower-back pain has long been a costly and personally devastating problem in society. Guidelines for the treatment of lower-back pain have provided evidence-based recommendations to help identify patients who will benefit from specific types of treatment in an effort to reduce costs and human suffering. However, there is little evidence that these guidelines are being applied in the daily practice of health care providers. Practical information is required to assist health care providers in triaging patients for specific treatments so that interventions can be targeted only to those who need them. In this way, iatrogenic complications and unnecessary costs can be contained. This chapter provides information on how to triage the patient with nonspecific lower-back pain for optimal care. The recommendations are supported by evidence-based guidelines, and when these are not available, best practice principles. Because appropriate treatment varies depending on the length of time a patient is suffering from lower-back pain, the chapter is divided into recommendations for acute, subacute, chronic and recurrent phases of lower-back pain.

### Quality of primary care guidelines for acute low back pain [^112kmu11]. Spine (2004). Low credibility.

Study Design

Systematic review of clinical guidelines.

Objectives

To assess the methodologic quality of existing guidelines for the management of acute low back pain.

Summary Of Background Data

Guidelines are playing an increasingly important role in evidence-based practice. After publication of the Quebec Task Force in Canada in 1987 and the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research guidelines in the United States in 1994, guidelines for acute low back pain were developed in many other countries. However, little is known about the methodologic quality of these guidelines.

Methods

Guidelines were selected by electronically searching MEDLINE and the Internet and through personal communication with experts in the field of low back pain research in primary care. The methodologic quality of the guidelines was assessed by two authors independently using the AGREE instrument.

Results

A total of 17 guidelines were included. Overall, the quality of reporting of guidelines was disappointing. Most guidelines clearly described the aim of the guideline and its target population, and most guideline development committees were multiprofessional. However, many other methodologic flaws were identified. More than half of the guidelines did not take patients' preferences into account, did not perform a pilot test among target users, did not clearly describe the methods of study identification and selection, did not include an external review, did not provide a procedure for updating, were not supported with tools for application, did not consider potential organizational barriers and cost implications, did not provide criteria for monitoring and audit, did not include recommendations for implementation strategies, and did not adequately record editorial independence and conflict of interest of the members. The diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations of the guidelines were largely similar.

Conclusions

The quality and transparency of the development process and the consistency in the reporting of primary care guidelines for low back pain need to be improved.

### Chronic low back pain in adults: evaluation and management [^111izsd2]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic low back pain, defined as lumbar pain persisting for 12 weeks or more, occurs in about 13% of U.S. adults. Patients with chronic low back pain should have a history and physical examination to identify red flags that may indicate serious conditions that warrant immediate intervention or yellow flags (i.e., psychological, environmental, and social factors) that indicate risk of disability. The examination should include an evaluation for radicular symptoms. Routine imaging is not recommended but is indicated when red flags are present, there is a neuromuscular deficit, or if pain does not resolve with conservative therapy. Patients should avoid bed rest. Nonpharmacologic treatment is first-line management and may include therapies with varying evidence of support, such as counseling, exercise therapy, spinal manipulation, massage, heat, dry needling, acupuncture, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and physical therapy. Pharmacologic interventions are second-line treatment. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the initial medication of choice; duloxetine may also be beneficial. Evidence is inconclusive to recommend the use of benzodiazepines, muscle relaxants, antidepressants, corticosteroids, insomnia agents, anticonvulsants, cannabis, acetaminophen, or long-term opioids. Epidural corticosteroid injections are not recommended except for short-term symptom relief in patients with radicular pain. Most patients with chronic low back pain will not require surgery; evaluation for surgery may be considered in those with persistent functional disabilities and pain from progressive spinal stenosis, worsening spondylolisthesis, or herniated disk. Physicians should consider prevention of chronic low back pain when patients present with acute back pain. Screening tools are available to predict the progression from acute to chronic low back pain, and targeted treatment strategies are beneficial for preventing progression.

### Initial assessment and management of pain: a pathway for care developed by the British pain society [^115KTvkM]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

There is wide variation in how pain is managed in the UK. Patients often find themselves caught in a sea of referrals while continuing to suffer with poorly relieved symptoms. The British Pain Society's (BPS) Initial Assessment and Management of Pain care pathway (one of the five new BPS care pathways published by the Map of Medicine(®)) sets out how best to initially manage persistent pain. Patient education and supported self-management is recommended from an early stage. This pathway focuses on the start of the journey of a patient with pain, where a full diagnostic work-up is not yet complete. The pathway covers diverse recommendations such as appropriate content of a pain consultation, the use of clinical decision management tools to aid stratification of care, and resources to support patients to make informed decisions. Recommendations for monitoring of therapeutic effect are also included. Early identification of people at high risk of chronic disability may allow more intensive management, better use of resources, and reduction in disability. Implementation poses significant challenges; more research is needed to determine the most effective interventions. This article highlights practice points for the non-specialist, discusses areas of controversy, and examines the challenges of implementation.

### Harms and benefits of opioids for management of non-surgical acute and chronic low back pain: a systematic review [^111yt792]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Consequences of prescription opioid use involve harms, addiction, tolerance and death. Despite routine prescription, opioids are not recommended for initial intervention by any major multidisciplinary low back pain (LBP) guideline.

Objective

Our primary purpose was to improve overall understanding of the harms and benefits associated with oral opioid interventions prescribed for treatment of acute or chronic back pain. Our second goal was to evaluate pain intensity and to compare and contrast these data with the harms. Our last objective was to evaluate conflicts of interest among the study authors and the findings.

Design/Data/Eligibility Criteria

Studies incorporating oral prescription opioid management of non-surgical LBP were evaluated. After systematic assessment, no studies that met inclusion included participants with specifically acute LBP. Therefore, extracted data reflects only populations with subacute and chronic LBP. Data on reported harms, severe harms, pain outcomes and withdrawal rates were extracted and meta-analyses were completed for opioid versus placebo trials and opioids versus non-opioid trials.

Results

Fourteen studies met inclusion/exclusion requirements. All trials involved short-term management with limited follow-up. A high percentage of harms were identified across most studies. Opioids were not shown to be superior to other medications, and only showed superiority to placebo comparators (at cost of additional harms).

Conclusion

This review identified trends of higher harms rates and higher percentages of severe harms in opioid arms for the management of subacute and chronic LBP. The majority of trials that demonstrated benefits with opioids also had potential conflicts of interest. Lastly, non-opioid medications demonstrated statistically significant pain improvement compared with opioids. We feel that the results of the trial are supportive of current LBP guidelines and do not condone the initial use of opioids in management of subacute or chronic LBP.

### Barriers and progress in the treatment of low back pain [^116vtd3L]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Low back pain is a common and costly condition and for most people is likely to be a recurrent problem throughout their lifetime. The management of patients with low back pain has been positively influenced by the rise in high quality clinical trials and systematic reviews in recent decades, and this body of evidence, synthesized in many clinical practice guidelines, has improved our knowledge about which treatments for low back pain are useful and which are not. For the largest group of patients, those with non-specific low back pain for whom a clear diagnosis cannot be given, the reality is that the treatments we have to offer tend to produce small effects, often only in the short term and none appear to effectively change long-term prognosis. This commentary summarizes the array of treatments currently available, notes the results of recent trials and guidelines and considers alternative approaches that may prove more valuable in achieving better patient outcomes in the future.

VA/DoD low back pain guideline — technology-based self-management modalities state that for the self-management of low back pain (LBP), "there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against technology-based modalities" and this is categorized as "(Neither for nor against | Reviewed, New-added)". The systematic evidence review identified "four studies" of technology-based modalities (mobile health [mHealth], online/web-based applications, Nintendo Wii, phone applications, and telephone-based) compared with usual care in patients with LBP, but limitations included pragmatically delivered multimodal components, small numbers of trials with variability in design and populations, and restricted outcomes; specifically, "the interventions included several pragmatically delivered components such as health coaching activity trackers and mobile technology (IMPACT App)", one SR "was limited to a small number of trials, and there was variability in design, contact, populations investigated, and measurement of outcomes", and "The study's quantitative synthesis was limited to the outcomes of pain and disability". Additional methodological concerns included that a study "must be interpreted with caution because loss-to-follow-up rate was higher for the intervention group than the control group", and "The overall quality of the evidence for most of the outcomes assessed was rated low to very low". Patient preferences may vary, as "some patients may value a technology-based option that would allow them to avoid traveling to receive care", and the scope note clarifies that recommendations for "patients with low back pain" include acute, subacute, or chronic LBP with or without neurological symptoms.

### Evidence-based medicine, systematic reviews, and guidelines in interventional pain management, part I: introduction and general considerations [^116wktY4]. Pain Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Evidence-based medicine, systematic reviews, and guidelines are part of modern interventional pain management. As in other specialties in the United States, evidence-based medicine appears to motivate the search for answers to numerous questions related to costs and quality of health care as well as access to care. Scientific, relevant evidence is essential in clinical care, policy-making, dispute resolution, and law. Consequently, evidence based practice brings together pertinent, trustworthy information by systematically acquiring, analyzing, and transferring research findings into clinical, management, and policy arenas. In the United States, researchers, clinicians, professional organizations, and government are looking for a sensible approach to health care with practical evidence-based medicine. All modes of evidence-based practice, either in the form of evidence-based medicine, systematic reviews, meta-analysis, or guidelines, evolve through a methodological, rational accumulation, analysis, and understanding of the evidentiary knowledge that can be applied in clinical settings. Historically, evidence-based medicine is traceable to the 1700s, even though it was not explicitly defined and advanced until the late 1970s and early 1980s. Evidence-based medicine was initially called "critical appraisal" to describe the application of basic rules of evidence as they evolve into application in daily practices. Evidence-based medicine is defined as a conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. Evidence-based practice is defined based on 4 basic and important contingencies, which include recognition of the patient's problem and construction of a structured clinical question, thorough search of medical literature to retrieve the best available evidence to answer the question, critical appraisal of all available evidence, and integration of the evidence with all aspects and contexts of the clinical circumstances. Systematic reviews provide the application of scientific strategies that limit bias by the systematic assembly, critical appraisal, and synthesis of all relevant studies on a specific topic. While systematic reviews are close to meta-analysis, they are vastly different from narrative reviews and health technology assessments. Clinical practice guidelines are systematically developed statements that aim to help physicians and patients reach the best health care decisions. Appropriately developed guidelines incorporate validity, reliability, reproducibility, clinical applicability and flexibility, clarity, development through a multidisciplinary process, scheduled reviews, and documentation. Thus, evidence-based clinical practice guidelines represent statements developed to improve the quality of care, patient access, treatment outcomes, appropriateness of care, efficiency and effectiveness and achieve cost containment by improving the cost benefit ratio. Part 1 of this series in evidence-based medicine, systematic reviews, and guidelines in interventional pain management provides an introduction and general considerations of these 3 aspects in interventional pain management.

### Individual patient education for managing acute and / or subacute low back pain: little additional benefit for pain and function compared to placebo. A systematic review with meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111JceWU]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effects of individual patient education for managing acute and/or subacute low back pain (LBP), compared to no intervention/placebo education, noneducational interventions, or other type of education.

Design

Systematic review with meta-analysis of randomized trials.

Literature Search

PubMed, CINAHL, PEDro, Embase, Scopus, and CENTRAL (up to September 30, 2020); reference lists of previous systematic reviews.

Study Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating individual education for patients with acute and/or subacute LBP.

Data Synthesis

Random-effects meta-analysis for clinically homogeneous RCTs. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach.

Results

We included 13 RCTs. There was moderate certainty evidence that individual patient education was more effective than placebo education for pain at medium term (mean difference [MD], -0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.52, -0.07) and physical function at short term (standardized mean difference [SMD], -0.25; 95% CI: -0.47, -0.02) and medium term (SMD, -0.26; 95% CI: -0.48, -0.04), but with no clinically relevant effects. There was low-to-moderate certainty evidence that individual patient education was superior to noneducational interventions on short-term quality of life (MD, -12.00; 95% CI: -20.05, -3.95) and medium-term sick leave (odds ratio = 0.32; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.88). We found no clinically relevant between-group effects for any other comparison (low-to-high certainty of evidence) at any follow-up.

Conclusion

One or 2 hours of individual patient education probably makes little to no difference in pain and functional outcomes compared with placebo for patients with acute and/or subacute LBP. Considering its effects on other outcomes (eg, reassurance) and patients' desire for information about their condition, it is reasonable to retain patient education as part of a first-line approach when managing acute and subacute LBP.

### Quality of low back pain guidelines improved [^116W9FHb]. Spine (2009). Low credibility.

Study Design

Systematic review of clinical guidelines.

Objective

To assess the methodological quality of clinical guidelines for the management of acute and chronic low back pain (LBP) in primary care and compare their recommendations.

Summary Of Background Data

A guideline evaluation performed in 2004 concluded that the quality and transparency of the development process and consistency in the reporting of primary care guidelines for LBP need to be improved. At present, several guidelines have been revised and new guidelines are published. We evaluated if the quality of guidelines has improved.

Methods

Guidelines published since 2004 were selected by electronically searching in MEDLINE, Cochrane Back Review Group database, Guideline Clearing House, Google, and contacting experts. The methodological quality of the guidelines was assessed by 2 authors independently, using the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research, and Evaluation in Europe instrument. Also, the diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations were compared.

Results

Fourteen guidelines were included. In general, the quality was satisfactory. The guidelines had best scores on clarity and presentation. The domain scores of scope and purpose were often moderate due to the absence of description of the clinical questions. The domain of stakeholder involvement scored moderate, mostly because guidelines were not tested among target users. Domains that had generally low scores were applicability and editorial independence. Four guidelines scored low on the rigor of development, but the other guidelines scored high on this domain. The diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations in the guidelines for acute LBP were mainly comparable while the recommendations for the management of chronic LBP varied widely.

Conclusion

Compared to the quality assessment performed in 2004, the average quality of guidelines has improved. However, guideline developers should still improve the quality transparency of the development process. Especially the applicability of guidelines and the editorial independence need to be ensured in future guidelines.

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries in adults: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians and American Academy of Family Physicians [^1112ppNB]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) and American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) developed this guideline to provide clinical recommendations on nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries in adults in the outpatient setting. The guidance is based on current best available evidence about benefits and harms, taken in the context of costs and patient values and preferences. This guideline does not address noninvasive treatment of low back pain, which is covered by a separate ACP guideline that has also been endorsed by AAFP.

Methods

This guideline is based on a systematic evidence review on the comparative efficacy and safety of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries in adults in the outpatient setting and a systematic review on the predictors of prolonged opioid use. We evaluated the following clinical outcomes using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system: pain (at ≤ 2 hours and at 1 to 7 days), physical function, symptom relief, treatment satisfaction, and adverse events.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience is all clinicians, and the target patient population is adults with acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries.

Recommendation 1

ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians treat patients with acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries with topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with or without menthol gel as first-line therapy to reduce or relieve symptoms, including pain; improve physical function; and improve the patient's treatment satisfaction (Grade: strong recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence).

Recommendation 2a

ACP and AAFP suggest that clinicians treat patients with acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries with oral NSAIDs to reduce or relieve symptoms, including pain, and to improve physical function, or with oral acetaminophen to reduce pain (Grade: conditional recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence).

Recommendation 2b

ACP and AAFP suggest that clinicians treat patients with acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries with specific acupressure to reduce pain and improve physical function, or with transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation to reduce pain (Grade: conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence).

Recommendation 3

ACP and AAFP suggest against clinicians treating patients with acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries with opioids, including tramadol (Grade: conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence).

The page states that future research should focus on reliably identifying clusters of history and physical examination findings that classify patients into subgroups to be validated by predictably effective treatments, and that further studies of nonspecific LBP are unwarranted.

### Healthy lifestyle care vs guideline-based care for low back pain: a randomized clinical trial [^112YwFFJ]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the effect of integrating healthy lifestyle care into back pain management on low back pain disability compared with current guideline-recommended care?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial with 346 participants, there was a greater mean reduction in disability favoring the healthy lifestyle approach compared with guideline care alone, equivalent to a mean difference of −1.3 points out of 24. Participants in the healthy lifestyle group who complied with treatment had large clinical meaningful improvements in disability.

Meaning

This study suggests that lifestyle care can safely be integrated into care for chronic low back pain, providing small improvements in disability compared with current guideline-recommended care and an opportunity to concurrently address prevalent chronic disease risks in this patient group.

### An updated overview of clinical guidelines for the management of non-specific low back pain in primary care [^112tRWkk]. European Spine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to present and compare the content of (inter)national clinical guidelines for the management of low back pain. To rationalise the management of low back pain, evidence-based clinical guidelines have been issued in many countries. Given that the available scientific evidence is the same, irrespective of the country, one would expect these guidelines to include more or less similar recommendations regarding diagnosis and treatment. We updated a previous review that included clinical guidelines published up to and including the year 2000. Guidelines were included that met the following criteria: the target group consisted mainly of primary health care professionals, and the guideline was published in English, German, Finnish, Spanish, Norwegian, or Dutch. Only one guideline per country was included: the one most recently published. This updated review includes national clinical guidelines from 13 countries and 2 international clinical guidelines from Europe published from 2000 until 2008. The content of the guidelines appeared to be quite similar regarding the diagnostic classification (diagnostic triage) and the use of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Consistent features for acute low back pain were the early and gradual activation of patients, the discouragement of prescribed bed rest and the recognition of psychosocial factors as risk factors for chronicity. For chronic low back pain, consistent features included supervised exercises, cognitive behavioural therapy and multidisciplinary treatment. However, there are some discrepancies for recommendations regarding spinal manipulation and drug treatment for acute and chronic low back pain. The comparison of international clinical guidelines for the management of low back pain showed that diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations are generally similar. There are also some differences which may be due to a lack of strong evidence regarding these topics or due to differences in local health care systems. The implementation of these clinical guidelines remains a challenge for clinical practice and research.

### A systematic review on the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions for chronic non-specific low-back pain [^114EDgpL]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Low-back pain (LBP) is related to disability and work absence and accounts for high economical costs in Western societies. The management of LBP comprises a range of different intervention strategies including surgery, non-medical interventions such as exercise, behavioral therapy, and alternative therapies. Pharmacological interventions are the most frequently recommended intervention for back pain. Over the last years, a substantial number of randomized clinical trials and systematic reviews have been published. Based on this literature, this overview presents the current evidence on pharmacological interventions for non-specific chronic low back pain.

Disease-specific treatment recommendations

Low-back pain (LBP)

Classification LBP is localized to the lumbar vertebrae (L1–l5) just above the gluteus muscle. LBP can be classified by duration as acute (< 6 weeks), subacute (6–12 weeks) and chronic (> 12 weeks). LBP may be classified by cause as mechanical (strains/sprains or fractures), nonmechanical (tumors) and referred pain (kidney or gall stones or pain in nearby tissue). LBP is classified by mechanism or "diagnostic triage" into serious spinal pathology (accompanied by "red flags"), nerve root pain/radicular pain and nonspecific LBP.
Diagnosis Use diagnostic methods such as physical examination, X-rays, ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diskography, bone scans and blood tests (B).– Identify "red flags", which are signs/symptoms that are unlikely to be observed in normal LBP and generally indicate involvement of serious pathology. Identifying the red flags may help diagnose underlying chronic conditions, such as cancer (C). Identify "yellow flags', which represent the psychosocial barriers that may influence the subjective response to pain and which may delay recovery or indicate the risk of chronification or disability (C).
Treatment Initiate treatment with acetaminophen and mild NSAIDs (ibuprofen, diclofenac) as first-line therapy (A). Second-line therapy should typically involve a combination of NSAIDs and mild opioids (codeine, tramadol) (A), followed by moderate-to-strong opioids (morphine, fentanyl) in severe pain. Third-line therapy should be initiated in case a central origin is suspected or if pain significantly affects the physical, mental and social behavior of patients; it may include anticonvulsants (gabapentin, pregabalin), sedatives (benzodiazepines) and antidepressants (amitriptyline, nortriptyline) (A).–

### Nonopioid therapies for pain management… [^115CtpDo]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

At a glance
- All patients should receive treatment for pain that provides the greatest benefits relative to risks.
- Use of nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapies should be maximized as appropriate because they do not carry the same risks as opioids.
- The 2022 CDC Clinical Practice Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Pain has expanded guidance on evidence-based nonopioid options for pain. Acute pain Nonopioid therapies are at least as effective as opioids for many common types of acute pain. Clinicians should maximize use of nonpharmacologic and nonopioid therapies as appropriate for the specific condition and patient and only consider opioid therapy for acute pain if benefits are anticipated to outweigh risks to the patient. Many acute pain conditions can often be managed most effectively with nonopioid medications.

Noninvasive and nonpharmacologic approaches to acute pain also have the potential to improve pain and function without risk for serious harms. Clinicians can consider using nonopioid therapies to treat common types of acute pain including:

- Low back or neck pain
- Dental pain
- Kidney stone pain
- Pain related to musculoskeletal injuries
- Pain related to minor surgeries typically associated with minimal tissue injury and mild postoperative pain
- Headaches, including episodic migraine.

Nonopioid treatment options for acute pain Nonpharmacologic pain therapies
- Ice
- Heat
- Elevation
- Rest
- Immobilization
- Exercise Nonopioid medications
- Topical or oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
- Acetaminophen
- Triptans, antiemetics, and dihydroergotamine for migraine Refer to Recommendation 1 in the 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for additional information and examples of nonopioid therapies to treat acute pain. Subacute and chronic pain Nonopioid therapies are preferred for subacute and chronic pain. Clinicians should maximize use of nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapies as appropriate for the specific condition and patient and only consider initiating opioid therapy if expected benefits for pain and function are anticipated to outweigh risks to the patient.

Train and Educate Stakeholders

Of the 25 studies included, 13 reported training and educating clinicians about evidence-based LBP management. Of the 13 studies that used a strategy within this category, eight provided training and distributed educational materials, three developed educational materials, one provided training, and one distributed educational materials. The designs of the studies in which the strategy train and educate stakeholders was used were mostly observational (n = 5, 38%), followed by experimental (n = 3, 23%) and qualitative (n = 4, 31%). One study was an economic evaluation conducted alongside a trial.

Training and Distribution of Educational Materials. French et al. and Mortimer et al. reported on implementation findings of the IMPLEMENT trial, where GPs in the intervention arm received educational materials (DVDs, electronic resources) and attended two educational workshops, each of 3 hours' duration. Workshops' content included patient assessment and how to make behaviorally specific guideline recommendations about imaging referrals and advice to stay active.

Slater et al. reported on the delivery of a 6.5-hour health care provider pain education program targeting primary care physicians. Workshop content included guidelines for acute and chronic nonspecific LBP, medical options, movement, response to pain, and pharmacological approaches to LBP. Primary care physicians were offered access to course materials and evidence-based LBP updates.

Coombs et al. targeted clinicians (medical officers, nursing staff, and physiotherapists) who worked in emergency departments through educational seminars that focused on skills for assessing, managing, educating, and referring patients according to a model of care for acute LBP. They also distributed educational materials, such as a hard copy of the model-of-care document, a website and decision support tools for appropriate use of lumbar imaging and analgesic medicines, posters displayed across the emergency departments, and patient handouts.

### Barriers and progress in the treatment of low back pain [^113gjuJZ]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

More than 2,500 controlled trials of treatments for back and neck pain listed in the Cochrane database, 32 Cochrane systematic reviews of randomized trials, 13 recent national clinical guidelines and two international guidelines from Europe have led to general agreement about best practice for non-specific LBP around the world. This starts with the provision of information about the expected course of the problem and self-care options that patients should try, early and gradual return to normal activities including work, discouragement of bed rest as a treatment, avoidance of routine imaging, use of first line medications (starting with time-contingent acetaminophen and progressing to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs if needed), and the assessment of psychosocial risk factors for chronicity (although the detail of how best to do this varies considerably between available guidelines). The use of passive treatments such as electrotherapy and therapeutic ultrasound is generally discouraged. As LBP persists, best practice recommendations include non-pharmacological therapies with proven benefits; supervised exercise, manual therapy, acupuncture, cognitive behavioral therapy with intensive multidisciplinary treatments reserved for those who do not benefit from these approaches. The content of recent guidelines, irrespective of country, is broadly similar regarding the diagnostic classification (the diagnostic triage outlined above) and the use of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions with some discrepancy around the use of spinal manipulation and some stronger medications.

### Clinical guidelines and payer policies on fusion for the treatment of chronic low back pain [^114mHTFq]. Spine (2011). Low credibility.

Study Design

Systematic review.

Objective

The purpose of this review is to provide a critical appraisal of general and fusion-specific clinical practice guidelines on the treatment of chronic nonradicular low back pain and compare the quality and evidence base of fusion guidelines and select payer policies. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA.: The treatment of lumbar spondylosis associated with low back pain with lumbar arthrodesis, or fusion, has risen fourfold in the past two decades. Given the significant associated health care costs, there is an increase in clinical guidelines and payer policies influencing patient treatment options. Assessment of the medical necessity of a treatment, such as lumbar fusions, based on medical literature will frequently supersede the determination of the physician in the care of their patient. Concerns regarding the effectiveness and costs of the surgical treatment of spinal disorders presenting with low back pain has placed enormous scrutiny on the value of surgical treatments to our patients. As both clinical guidelines and payer policies have a major impact on the perceived effectiveness, or medical necessity, of lumbar fusions for the treatment of chronic nonradicular low back pain, a review of this topic was undertaken.

Methods

An electronic literature search of PubMed, the National Guideline Clearinghouse and the International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment was performed to identify clinical practice guidelines on assessment and treatment of chronic nonradicular low back pain, including those on use of lumbar fusion, as well as relevant technology assessments. A Google search for publicly available private and public payer policies related to fusion was also performed. A hand search was used to identify specific studies cited for support of the recommendations made. A modified Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation instrument was used to provide a standardized assessment method for evaluating the quality of development of the evidence base and recommendations in guidelines and selected health policies. This was combined with appraisal of the evidence base supporting the recommendations.

Results

Three systematic reviews of general guidelines from a PubMed search yielding 94 citations were included. A convenience sample of five guidelines with recommendations on fusion was taken from 182 citations identified by the National Guideline Clearinghouse and the International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment searches. Two guidelines were developed by US professional societies, (neurosurgery and pain management), and three were European-based guidelines (Belgium, United Kingdom, and the European Cooperation in Science and Technology). The general guidelines were consistent with their recommendations for diagnosis, but inconsistent regarding recommendations for treatment. All guidelines and payer policies with recommendations on fusion included some set of the primary randomized controlled trials comparing fusion to other treatment options with the exception of one policy. However, no clear pattern with regard to the quality of development was identified based on the modified Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation tool. There were differences in specialty society recommendations.

Conclusion

Three systematic reviews of evidence-based guidelines that provide general guidance for the assessment and treatment of chronic low back pain described consistent recommendations and guidance for the evaluation of chronic low back pain but inconsistent recommendations and guidance for treatment. Five evidence-based guidelines with recommendations on the use of fusion for the treatment of chronic low back pain were evaluated. There is some consistency across guidelines and policies that are government sponsored with regard to development process and critical evaluation of index studies as well as overall recommendations. There were differences in specialty society recommendations. There is heterogeneity in the medical payer policies reviewed possibly due to variations in the literature cited and transparency of the development process. A description of how recommendations are formulated and disclosure of any potential bias in policy development is important. Three-medical payer policies reviewed are of poor quality with one rated as good with respect to their development based on the modified Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation tool. Medical payer policies influence patient care by defining medical necessity for approving treatments, and should be held to the same standards for transparency and development as guidelines.

Clinical Recommendations

The spine care community needs to develop (or update) high-quality treatment guidelines. The process should be transparent, methodologically rigorous, and consistent with the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation and Institute of Medicine recommendations. This effort should be collaborative across specialty/society groups and would benefit from patient and public input. Payer policies and treatment guidelines need to be transparent and based on the highest quality evidence available. Clinicians from specialty/society groups, guideline developers and policy makers should collaborate on their development. This process would also benefit from public and patient input.

Diagnosis & Treatment of Low Back Pain | Summary of Recommendations — risk of conversion from acute to chronic low back pain and return to work: It is recommended that psychosocial factors and workplace factors be assessed when counseling patients regarding the risk of conversion from acute to chronic low back pain (Grade of Recommendation: A). It is recommended that psychosocial factors be used as prognostic factors for return to work following an episode of acute low back pain (Grade of Recommendation: A). It is recommended that pain severity and functional impairment be used to stratify risk of conversion from acute to chronic low back pain (Grade of Recommendation: A). It is suggested that prior episodes of low back pain be considered a prognostic factor for the conversion from acute to chronic low back pain (Grade of Recommendation: B). There is insufficient evidence to assess sleep quality as a prognostic variable to predict recovery from acute low back pain (Grade of Recommendation: I). There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of smoking and/or obesity as prognostic factors for the conversion from acute to chronic low back pain (Grade of Recommendation: I).

### DOSage of exercise for chronic low back pain disorders (DOSE): protocol for a systematic review with dose-response network meta-analysis [^112v4KMT]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Data coding and management

In line with the recommendations by Pedder et al 2021, we will organise the datasets for dose-response analysis across various follow-up time points. This will involve extracting and classifying the interventions as follows:

Active versus inactive: classifying interventions as exercise or one of the included comparators (non-exercise conservative treatments, true/waitlist control, usual or standard care, or placebo/sham treatment interventions (see online supplemental data 5).
Dose level: classifying interventions by an overall 'cumulative dose' of the exercise (weekly and total minutes of exercise training)
Component level: classifying interventions based on the following: a. Intensity: low/moderate/high. b. Frequency: Number of sessions per week. c. Duration: intervention and session duration.

Missing data

If we are unable to extract outcome data (mean, median, SD, IQR, range, N responders, N randomised) directly from the record or calculate it from the data provided, we will contact authors (three repeated contact attempts over 4 weeks). If solely SD data are missing, we will impute these using the pooled SD (on the log-scale) from studies for which SD is available for a given outcome. If data for mean or N are missing, the study will be excluded from meta-analysis.

Risk of bias assessment

Two reviewers will independently assess the risk of bias (RoB) in the included studies using version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials (RoB 2). Any conflicts in the RoB ratings will be discussed, and an adjudicator will be contacted if they persist. Cochrane RoB 2 is assessed on a per-outcome/study basis. The outcomes included in the current study are typically, with the exception of dropouts, patient reported and we expect the RoB rating to not deviate importantly for these outcomes. For feasibility, we will assess Cochrane RoB 2 for one of the outcomes in the following priority order: pain, disability and mental health. Where trials report multiple time points, Cochrane guidance is not available as to which to choose. We will assess the time point closest to the end of the exercise-intervention phase. The RoB ratings will be visualised in Rusing the robvis package.
