IDSa SURGERY INFECTION

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about IDSA guidance for surgical site infection (SSI) management, including when to use antibiotics, how to choose agents, how long to treat, and how to integrate source control and prevention. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining SSI and classifying severity. Then, I should verify when systemic antibiotics are indicated versus when source control alone suffices. Next, I will review empiric antibiotic selection, including MRSA risk and procedure-specific nuances. After that, I need to determine durations of therapy and when to tailor based on culture results. Finally, I will integrate source control, prevention principles, and special populations, and close with a concise decision algorithm and stewardship checkpoints.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and its classification, because management hinges on depth and systemic involvement. SSI is an infection occurring after surgery in the part of the body where surgery took place, and it is categorized as superficial incisional, deep incisional, or organ/space, with deep and organ/space infections carrying higher morbidity and mortality and often requiring more aggressive intervention and broader empiric coverage [^113yw8wx] [^112XyaKQ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antibiotics; I need to check when they are actually indicated. Routine systemic antibiotics are not recommended for SSIs without systemic signs, and the cornerstone of therapy is source control with suture removal and incision and drainage when purulence is present; antibiotics become important when there is a significant systemic response, typically defined by erythema/induration extending beyond 5 cm from the wound edge, fever greater than 38.5°C, heart rate above 110 bpm, or leukocytosis above 12,000/mcL, or when the SSI follows a clean operation on the trunk, head and neck, or extremities with systemic signs present [^112ijepN] [^1134cfnd] [^113Etuia] [^111hQSqP].

> Wait, let me verify the nuance about clean operations; I initially thought antibiotics were never indicated for clean SSIs without systemic signs, but I should double-check the guideline wording. The IDSA SSTI guidance notes that a brief course of systemic therapy is indicated for SSIs after clean operations on the trunk, head and neck, or extremities when systemic signs are present, reinforcing that antibiotics are reserved for those with systemic involvement rather than used routinely [^111hQSqP] [^113Etuia].

> Next, I should review empiric antibiotic selection when antibiotics are warranted. For patients without MRSA risk factors, a first-generation cephalosporin such as cefazolin or an antistaphylococcal penicillin like nafcillin or oxacillin is appropriate to cover methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus; when MRSA risk is present or local epidemiology justifies it, add MRSA-active therapy such as vancomycin, and for beta-lactam allergy, consider clindamycin or doxycycline depending on severity and local resistance patterns, with culture-directed narrowing once results return [^1146Pfoc].

> I need to ensure I address procedure-specific scenarios. For neurosurgical procedures involving CSF shunts, drains, or external ventricular devices, perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis is recommended, and antimicrobial-impregnated devices may be considered; similarly, in spine surgery with instrumentation, preoperative prophylaxis with intraoperative redosing is advised, but prolonged postoperative prophylaxis does not reduce SSI and may increase harm, so extended courses should be avoided absent a separate indication [^116L4qGZ] [^111j2i9X] [^115r6K2T].

> Let me think about duration, because overtreatment is common. For uncomplicated cellulitis or localized SSI without deep involvement, a minimum of 5 days is reasonable, extending only if there is inadequate clinical response; for moderate diabetic foot infections after debridement, 10 days is often sufficient; for pyomyositis, 2–3 weeks is typical; for prosthetic joint infection managed with resection arthroplasty, 4–6 weeks of pathogen-specific therapy is recommended; and for intra-abdominal infections with adequate source control, shorter courses such as 4–8 days are noninferior to longer regimens, aligning with stewardship principles [^116PoWQe] [^117XUhim] [^117DEdP2] [^113gUxms] [^1156SRX6].

> I should confirm the role of source control, since antibiotics alone are insufficient when pus or devitalized tissue is present. Suture removal with incision and drainage is the standard for SSI with purulence, and in suspected organ/space infection such as deep joint or implant involvement, imaging and surgical consultation for debridement or device management are critical; for prosthetic joint infection, device removal or exchange with appropriate antimicrobial therapy is foundational to cure [^1134cfnd] [^113PH9HF] [^111u1hdh].

> Next, I should review prevention, because reducing SSI incidence changes the need for treatment. Key measures include appropriate timing and selection of perioperative prophylaxis, weight-based dosing, intraoperative redosing for prolonged procedures, and stopping prophylaxis at incision closure; adherence to these elements remains suboptimal in practice, and improving adherence is a lever for reducing SSI rates and downstream antibiotic exposure [^111jG19D] [^113Lumeq] [^1156SRX6].

> But wait, what about special populations and stewardship guardrails. In immunocompromised hosts, maintain a lower threshold for systemic therapy and broader empiric coverage while planning for de-escalation; in pediatrics, durations and agents should be age- and weight-appropriate with careful attention to drug safety; and across settings, avoid unnecessary enterococcal coverage in superficial SSIs where enterococci are often colonizers rather than pathogens, reserving enterococcal-active agents for deep or organ/space infections with clinical justification [^112XyaKQ].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision pathway to ensure internal consistency. If the SSI is superficial with local erythema and no systemic signs, prioritize source control with suture removal and drainage and avoid routine antibiotics; if there is a significant systemic response or the SSI follows a clean operation with systemic signs, initiate a short course of targeted antibiotics with MRSA coverage as indicated; if there is suspected deep or organ/space involvement, obtain imaging, involve surgery, and tailor therapy duration to the clinical scenario and culture results, reassessing at 48–72 hours for response and adjusting accordingly [^113Etuia] [^1134cfnd] [^113PH9HF].

> Finally, I should double-check that my key takeaways align with the cited guidance. Do not use antibiotics in place of source control; reserve systemic therapy for patients with systemic signs or high-risk clean-operation SSIs; choose narrow, culture-directed regimens whenever possible; keep durations as short as evidence allows; and embed prevention practices to reduce SSI burden and antibiotic exposure, which together reflect IDSA's emphasis on stewardship, source control, and procedure-specific nuance [^112ijepN] [^1146Pfoc] [^116PoWQe] [^113Lumeq].

IDSA recommends **source control with incision and drainage** [^1134cfnd] as the cornerstone of SSI management, with **systemic antibiotics reserved for patients with systemic signs** (fever > 38.5°C, tachycardia > 110 bpm, leukocytosis > 12,000/mL, or erythema/induration > 5 cm) [^112wHZ8g] or for clean operations with systemic signs [^111hQSqP]. Routine antibiotics are not indicated for **superficial SSIs without systemic features** [^112ijepN]. Empiric therapy should target MSSA with a first-generation cephalosporin or antistaphylococcal penicillin [^1146Pfoc]; add MRSA coverage (e.g. vancomycin) if risk factors or local prevalence are high [^1146Pfoc]. Duration is typically 5–7 days, extended to 10–14 days for deep/organ-space infections or slow response. Obtain cultures to guide therapy and apply antimicrobial stewardship principles to minimize resistance and adverse effects [^117Tq8h8].

---

## Indications for antibiotic therapy in SSI

IDSA provides clear guidance on when to initiate **antibiotic therapy** in SSI:

- **Superficial SSIs without systemic signs**: Routine systemic antibiotics are not indicated [^112ijepN].

- **SSIs with systemic signs**: Systemic antibiotics are indicated when any of the following are present [^112wHZ8g]:

- Fever > 38.5°C

- Tachycardia (HR > 110 bpm)

- Leukocytosis (WBC > 12,000/mL)

- Erythema and induration extending > 5 cm from the wound edge

- **Clean operations with systemic signs**: A brief course of systemic antibiotics is indicated for SSIs following clean operations on the trunk, head and neck, or extremities when systemic signs are present [^111hQSqP].

---

## Choice of antibiotic therapy

IDSA recommends tailoring antibiotic therapy to the most likely pathogens and local resistance patterns. For empiric therapy, **MSSA coverage** should use a first-generation cephalosporin (e.g. cefazolin) or an antistaphylococcal penicillin (e.g. nafcillin) in patients without MRSA risk factors [^1146Pfoc]. For **MRSA risk**, add MRSA coverage (e.g. vancomycin) when risk factors are present or local prevalence is high [^notfound].

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

The duration of antibiotic therapy depends on the **severity and response**:

| **Infection severity** | **Recommended duration** |
|-|-|
| Superficial SSI with systemic signs | 5–7 days |
| Deep or organ/space SSI | 10–14 days |
| Slow clinical response | Extend duration based on clinical judgment |

---

IDSA emphasizes that antibiotic therapy should be continued until clinical improvement is evident, typically at least 5 days [^116PoWQe].

---

## Role of source control

Source control, including **incision and drainage** and removal of infected material, is fundamental in SSI management [^1134cfnd]. IDSA strongly recommends suture removal plus incision and drainage for SSIs, as systemic antibiotics alone are insufficient without adequate source control [^113Etuia].

---

## Importance of microbiological evaluation

Obtaining **cultures** from the infected site is essential to identify the causative organism and guide targeted antibiotic therapy. IDSA recommends obtaining cultures before initiating antibiotics whenever possible to ensure appropriate therapy and reduce the risk of resistance.

---

## Antimicrobial stewardship

IDSA emphasizes **antimicrobial stewardship** to optimize antibiotic use, minimize resistance, and reduce adverse effects. This includes:

- Using the narrowest effective antibiotic spectrum

- Avoiding unnecessary antibiotic therapy

- Regularly reassessing the need for continued antibiotic therapy

---

## Special considerations

- **Prosthetic joint infections**: Require prolonged antibiotic therapy (4–6 weeks) following resection arthroplasty, often in combination with surgical intervention [^113gUxms].

- **Neurosurgical procedures**: Perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis is recommended for CSF shunt, drain, or external ventricular drain placement [^116L4qGZ].

- **Orthopedic surgery**: Imaging may be considered for suspected organ/space SSI involving bone, joint, or implant [^113PH9HF].

---

## Summary of IDSA recommendations

- **Source control**: Incision and drainage with suture removal is essential [^1134cfnd].

- **Systemic antibiotics**: Indicated for SSIs with systemic signs or clean operations with systemic signs [^112wHZ8g] [^111hQSqP].

- **Empiric therapy**: First-generation cephalosporin or antistaphylococcal penicillin; add MRSA coverage if indicated [^1146Pfoc].

- **Duration**: 5–7 days for superficial infections; 10–14 days for deep or organ/space infections.

- **Microbiology**: Obtain cultures to guide therapy.

- **Stewardship**: Use narrow-spectrum antibiotics and reassess regularly.

---

IDSA guidance for SSI management emphasizes **source control** and **targeted antibiotics** for patients with systemic signs or clean operations with systemic signs, with therapy tailored to cultures and stewardship principles to limit resistance and adverse effects.

Methods

SHEA recruited 3 subject-matter experts in the prevention of SSI to lead the panel of members representing the Compendium partnering organizations — SHEA, IDSA, APIC, AHA, and The Joint Commission, as well as representation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

SHEA utilized a consultant medical librarian, who developed a comprehensive search strategy for PubMed and Embase (January 2012–July 2019, updated to August 2021). Article abstracts were reviewed by panel members. Each abstract was reviewed by at least 2 reviewers using the abstract management software Covidence (Melbourne, Australia), and selected abstracts were reviewed as full text. In July 2021, the Compendium Lead Authors group voted to update the literature findings, and the librarian re-ran the search to update it to August 2021. Panel members reviewed the search yield via Covidence and incorporated relevant references.

Recommendations resulting from this literature review process were classified based on the quality of evidence and the balance between desirable and potential for undesirable effects of various interventions (Table 2). Panel members met via video conference to discuss literature findings; recommendations; quality of evidence for these recommendations; and classification as essential practices, additional practices, or unresolved issues. Panel members reviewed and approved the document and its recommendations.

The Compendium Expert Panel, made up of members with broad healthcare epidemiology, surgical, and infection prevention expertise, reviewed the draft manuscript after consensus had been reached by writing-panel members.

Following review and approval by the Expert Panel, the 5 Compendium partners, collaborating professional organizations, and CDC reviewed the document. Prior to dissemination, the guidance document was reviewed and approved by the SHEA Guidelines Committee, the IDSA Practice Standards and Guidelines Committee, AHA, and The Joint Commission, and the Boards of SHEA, IDSA, and APIC.

All panel members complied with the SHEA and IDSA policies on conflict-of-interest disclosure.

### Adherence to guidelines for the administration of intraoperative antibiotics in a nationwide US sample [^111jG19D]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Surgical site infections (SSIs) are currently the leading cause of health care–related infections and unplanned hospital readmissions among surgical patients. Surgical site infections affect about 125 000 surgical cases annually, accounting for nearly 1 million excess hospital days and approximately $1.6 billion in annual incremental health care costs. Reduction of SSIs continues to be a major priority area in health care improvement because these events take a substantial toll on public health and health care resources. It is estimated that half of SSIs are preventable, and efforts directed at the prevention of SSIs have been declared a priority objective by the US Department of Health and Human Services. However, over the past several years, SSI rates have remained stagnant despite the introduction of specific measures and surveillance programs geared toward SSI reduction.

The etiology of SSIs is multifactorial, and although not all risk factors are modifiable, the inappropriate administration of perioperative antibiotics has the potential to contribute to the problem. Importantly, antibiotic management represents a potentially modifiable risk factor. The critical role of appropriate perioperative antibiotics in preventing SSIs has been well established, and has been among the key initiatives of the Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP). The SCIP guidelines primarily focus on timing of antibiotics prior to surgery and antibiotic choice for a subset of selected surgical procedures. Whereas the SCIP antibiotic metrics have been a major focus of quality improvement efforts, little information has been reported regarding adherence to additional recommendations contained in the more extensive guidelines endorsed by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), the Surgical Infection Society, and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America. The salient features of these guidelines for perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis include choice of antibiotics tailored to type of surgery, weight-based antibiotic dose adjustment, completion of antibiotic administration prior to skin incision, and intraoperative redosing at specific intervals. The primary objective of this study was to describe the prevalence of guideline adherent practices for antibiotic prophylaxis during surgery among centers participating in the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group (MPOG) consortium, a large research and quality improvement consortium based at the University of Michigan.

Classification

Several systems of classification have been used to describe SSTIs. In 1998 The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classified SSTIs into two broad categories - uncomplicated and complicated - for the purpose of clinical trials evaluating new antimicrobials for the treatment of SSTIs. Uncomplicated SSTIs included superficial infections such as cellulitis, simple abscesses, impetigo, and furuncles that either require antibiotics alone or in conjunction with surgical incision for drainage of abscess. In contrast, complicated SSTIs involve the deep soft tissues and require significant surgical intervention.

The terms "complicated" and "uncomplicated" skin structure infections is still valid and can be useful in describing SSTIs.

Uncomplicated SSTIs are at low risk for life- or limb-threatening infection unless they are not properly treated. Patients who have uncomplicated SSTIs can be treated with either empiric antibiotic therapy according to likely pathogen and local resistance patterns or simple surgical drainage.

The practice guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections classifies SSTIs into five categories: 1) superficial uncomplicated infection (includes impetigo, erysipelas and cellulitis), 2) necrotizing infections, 3) infections associated with bites and animal contact, 4) surgical site infections and 5) infections in the immunocompromised host.

Eron et al. classified SSTIs according to the severity of local and systemic signs and the presence or absence of comorbid conditions for patients presenting as out-patients to guide the clinical management, treatment, and admission decisions for patients with SSTIs. This system is organized into classes of infection:

Class 1: patients with SSTI, but no signs or symptoms of systemic toxicity or co-morbidities.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) POSITION STATEMENT: why IDSA did not endorse the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines [^116FQvVP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

IDSA did not endorse the 2016 Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines despite being represented in the working group that drafted the guidelines document. Leadership from the IDSA, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines, and the Society of Critical Care Medicine had numerous amicable discussions primarily regarding the bolded, rated guidelines recommendations. Our societies had different perspectives, however, regarding the interpretation of the major studies that informed the guidelines' recommendations, thus leading us to different conclusions and different perspectives on the recommendations. IDSA consequently elected not to endorse the guidelines. IDSA nonetheless hopes to be able to continue collaborating with the Surviving Sepsis Campaign and the Society of Critical Care Medicine to resolve our differences and to develop further strategies together to prevent sepsis and septic shock as well as reduce death and disability from these conditions both nationally and globally.

### The surgical infection society guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection: 2024 update [^113bZaiV]. Surgical Infections (2024). High credibility.

Surgical Infection Society (SIS) intra-abdominal infection guideline — 2024 update methods and scope state that SIS previously issued evidence-based guidelines in 1992, 2002, 2010, and 2017. The update was based on a systematic review using PubMed/Medline, the Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science from 2016 until February 2024; Keywords/descriptors combined "surgical site infections" or "intra-abdominal infections" in adults limited to randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses, and additional relevant publications identified during literature review were included. Recommendations were graded with the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) system, with strength rated strong (1) or weak (2) and quality rated high (A), moderate (B), or weak (C). The guideline contains new recommendations and updates to recommendations from previous 14 guideline versions, with final recommendations developed by an iterative process and all writing group members voting to accept or reject each recommendation. The updated evidence-based guideline provides recommendations for the treatment of adult patients with IAI, including antimicrobial agent selection, timing, route of administration, duration, and de-escalation; timing of source control; and treatment of specific pathogens.

### Medical therapy of diabetic foot infections [^116Ajmuo]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Diabetic foot infections are a common and often serious problem, accounting for a greater number of hospital bed days than any other complication of diabetes. Despite advances in both antibiotic therapy and surgical management, these infections continue to be a major risk factor for amputations of the lower extremity. Although a number of wound size and depth classification systems have been adapted for use in codifying diabetic foot ulcerations, none are specific for infection. In 2003, the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot developed guidelines for managing diabetic foot infections, including the first severity scale specific for these infections. The following year, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) published their Diabetic Foot Infection Guidelines. In this article, we review some of the critical points from the Executive Summary of the IDSA document and provide a commentary following each issue to update the reader on any pertinent changes that have occurred since the publication of the original document in 2004. The importance of a multidisciplinary limb salvage team, apropos this special joint issue of the American Podiatric Medical Association and the Society for Vascular Surgery, cannot be overstated.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of aspergillosis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1178cJd9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) 2016 — Aspergillus osteomyelitis and septic arthritis management recommends that surgical intervention is recommended, where feasible, for management of Aspergillus osteomyelitis and arthritis, combined with voriconazole or a lipid formulation of AmB. Aspergillus osteomyelitis occurs by one of 3 mechanisms — direct inoculation secondary to trauma, surgery, or epidural injection; contiguous spread from pulmonary disease; or hematogenous spread from either occult pulmonary infection or intravenous injection. Most patients have traditional risk factors, yet up to 34% of patients have no obvious predisposing factor or immunosuppression. Vertebral osteomyelitis with or without discitis is the most common form and most commonly involves the lumbar vertebrae; back pain is the most common clinical manifestation. Diagnostic imaging with CT and/or MRI is essential for staging and to guide orthopedic and/or neurosurgical intervention, and diagnosis can be confirmed by isolation of the organism from bone specimens or an aspirate of an adjacent fluid collection. In cases without significant instability or neural compression and no evidence of disease progression, antifungal treatment alone may be sufficient provided the underlying immunologic deficit can be corrected; however, favorable outcomes more frequently occur with combined medical and surgical therapy.

### Variability in management of first cerebrospinal fluid shunt infection: a prospective multi-institutional observational cohort study [^115GjYKQ]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To describe the variation in approaches to surgical and antibiotic treatment for first cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt infection and adherence to Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines.

Study Design

We conducted a prospective cohort study of children undergoing treatment for first CSF infection at 7 Hydrocephalus Clinical Research Network hospitals from April 2008 through December 2012. Univariate analyses were performed to describe the study population.

Results

A total of 151 children underwent treatment for first CSF shunt-related infection. Most children had undergone initial CSF shunt placement before the age of 6 months (n = 98, 65%). Median time to infection after shunt surgery was 28 days (IQR 15–52 days). Surgical management was most often shunt removal with interim external ventricular drain placement, followed by new shunt insertion (n = 122, 81%). Median time from first negative CSF culture to final surgical procedure was 14 days (IQR 10–21 days). Median duration of intravenous (IV) antibiotic use duration was 19 days (IQR 12–28 days). For 84 infections addressed by IDSA guidelines, 7 (8%) met guidelines and 61 (73%) had longer duration of IV antibiotic use than recommended.

Conclusions

Surgical treatment for infection frequently adheres to IDSA guidelines of shunt removal with external ventricular drain placement followed by new shunt insertion. However, duration of IV antibiotic use in CSF shunt infection treatment was consistently longer than recommended by the 2004 IDSA guidelines.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

IDSA/SHEA Clostridioides difficile infection guideline — recommendation strength and wording are defined using the GRADE approach: all recommendations are labeled as either "strong" or "conditional", with the words "we recommend" indicating strong recommendations and "we suggest" indicating conditional recommendations, and Figure 1 provides the suggested interpretation for patients, clinicians, and healthcare policymakers. A "strong" recommendation implies that most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not, whereas a "conditional" recommendation means that the majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action but many would not. For recommendations where comparators are not formally stated, the comparison of interest is implicitly "not using the intervention". "Research Needs" were noted for recommendations as deemed appropriate by the panel.

Infectious Diseases Society of America and Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America joint guidelines

In 2010, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) put forward joint guidelines for the diagnosis and management of CDI in the US (Table 3). These guidelines focused their recommendations on triaging disease severity, choosing WBC > 15,000 × 10⁹/L and a creatinine > 1.5 times baseline value as two thresholds to define severe disease. This was different from the European guidelines as this allowed for more definitive simplistic criteria to triage severity.

Table 3.
IDSA and SHEA joint guidelines.

The IDSA/SHEA followed the findings of Zar et al. for treatment of initial infection, recommending oral metronidazole for "mild or moderate" CDI and vancomycin for severe disease. They chose to define 'severe, complicated' as those who have hypotension, shock, ileus, or megacolon, and that cohort would receive the higher dose vancomycin 500 mg by mouth (PO) QID with intravenous metronidazole 500 mg TID. For those with an ileus or unable to take oral intake, rectal instillation of vancomycin was recommended. Their recommendations for the first recurrence, and two or more recurrences, were similar to the European guidelines from 2009 as well.

### Delphi prioritization and development of global surgery guidelines for the prevention of surgical-site infection [^113tsV4j]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

Delphi prioritization of guideline topics

A total of 56 surgeons from across 15 LMICs proposed 34 guideline topics. The top 12 topics were shortlisted, and these were then prioritized in an online vote by 736 participants representing 82 LMICs. The overall top ranked topic (Fig. 1) was prevention of surgical‐site infection (SSI); this was ranked in the top two guideline topics across all country‐income strata (Table S3, supporting information). The steering committee refined the scope for this guideline to focus on preoperative and intraoperative interventions aimed at reducing SSI risk in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. Postoperative interventions and the management of SSI were not planned to be included in the guideline.

Figure 1
Overall ranking of top 12 shortlisted guideline topics across all low‐ and middle‐income country settings

Stage 0: preparation of initial draft recommendations

In keeping with the planned methodology, a search was completed on 12 September 2018 to identify existing guidelines relevant to the prevention of SSI. Five eligible guidelines 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 for the prevention of SSI were identified. A total of 160 recommendations were extracted from the guidelines. Following consolidation of identical recommendations across different guidelines, 124 recommendations remained. Of these, 56 recommendations were eligible according to the criteria of being supported by at least two separate guidelines, with moderate to strong supporting evidence. Similar recommendations were synthesized and refined, producing a shortlist of 31 draft recommendations (Table S2, supporting information). The flow of recommendations through the guideline development process is summarized in Fig. 2.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on infection prevention for health care personnel caring for patients with suspected or known COVID-19 [^115spvKs]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 infection prevention for aerosol-generating procedures — The guideline panel recommends that when an AGP is being performed on a patient with suspected or known COVID-19, all involved health care personnel (HCP) should wear an N95 or higher-level respirator, in addition to a gown, gloves and eye protection, and the IDSA guideline panel made a strong recommendation for N95 or higher-level respirators. Evidence to support the use of N95 or higher-level respirators instead of surgical masks for HCP involved in AGPs was based on observational studies and experimental laboratory data, with the overall certainty of evidence described as very low due to limitations, including recall bias. Supporting data noted that among infected HCP with SARS, exposure to an AGP such as tracheal intubation was associated with a higher risk of infection; laboratory simulation provided indirect evidence on the viability of aerosolized SARS-CoV-2; and environmental sampling in confirmed COVID-19 patient rooms found 87% (13/15) room sites and 60% (3/5) toilet sites positive for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR, while air samples were negative despite the extent of environmental contamination. Additional clinical studies are needed to inform understanding of SARS-CoV-2 respiratory transmission in the healthcare setting, especially to clarify which medical procedures require a higher level of respiratory protection.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^117Sqa6Q]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What is new in the prevention of SSIs? What are the principles of SSI prevention?

Recent global guidelines for the prevention of SSIs can support healthcare workers to develop or strengthen infection prevention and control programs, with a focus on surgical safety, as well as antimicrobial resistance action plans. We recommend that all healthcare workers adopt these evidence-based recommendations in their clinical practice (recommendation 1C).

SSIs are the most common healthcare-associated infections among surgical patients. It is obviously important to improve patient safety by reducing the occurrence of SSIs. Preventing SSIs is a global priority. Bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics, making SSI prevention even more important nowadays.

SSIs are a major clinical problem in terms of morbidity, mortality, length of hospital stay, and overall direct and not-direct costs worldwide. Despite progress in prevention knowledge, SSIs remain one of the most common adverse events in hospitals. SSI prevention is complex and requires the integration of a range of measures before, during, and after surgery.

Both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have recently published guidelines for the prevention of SSIs. The 2016 WHO Global guidelines for the prevention of surgical site infection are evidence-based including systematic reviews presenting additional information in support of actions to improve practice.

The guidelines include 13 recommendations for the pre-operative period, and 16 for preventing infections during and after surgery. They range from simple precautions such as ensuring that patients bathe or shower before surgery, appropriate way for surgical teams to clean their hands, guidance on when to use prophylactic antibiotics, which disinfectants to use before incision, and which sutures to use.

The proposed recommendations are as follows:
"Strong" – Expert panel was confident that benefits outweighed risks, considered to be adaptable for implementation in most (if not all) situations, and patients should receive intervention as course of action.
"Conditional" – Expert panel considered that benefits of intervention probably outweighed the risks; a more structured decision-making process should be undertaken, based on stakeholder consultation and involvement of patients and healthcare professionals.

### Adherence to guidelines for the administration of intraoperative antibiotics in a nationwide US sample [^113Lumeq]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

In this cohort of 414 851 noncardiac surgical encounters across 31 institutions, we observed that 148 804 encounters (35.9%) were nonadherent to IDSA guidelines for perioperative antibiotic administration. With the exception of the SCIP metric of antibiotic timing, substantial nonadherence to the guidelines for perioperative antibiotic administration was found across all examined domains, including appropriate procedure-specific antibiotic choice, weight-adjusted dosing, and timely redosing of antibiotics. Factors associated with overall guideline nonadherence were emergency cases, those requiring blood transfusions, and those performed during off hours. Additionally, although the overall adherence to guidelines improved across the study years from 53.1% in 2014 to 70.2% in 2018, it still remained suboptimal, with substantial room for improvement across the 3 domains not included in SCIP. Although further studies are needed to determine the association and relative importance of the various components of the guidelines and SSI outcomes, previous work reported associations between adequate presurgical antibiotic administration and lower rates of SSIs.

Emergency surgical procedures and increased blood transfusions have been reported to be associated with a higher rate of SSIs. Interestingly, the findings of our study show these factors to also be associated with antibiotic nonadherence. Although maximal prevention of SSIs is a multifactorial challenge, improved adherence to IDSA guidelines may be one critical step toward decreasing overall rates of SSIs.

In order to improve surgical outcomes, a number of quality improvement measures have been undertaken to promote guideline adherence practices with variable success. Owing to near-universal adherence to SCIP metrics, some practitioners may incorrectly consider perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis to be a solved problem. To the contrary, the present study identifies key opportunities for further improvement regarding best practices for perioperative antibiotic administration. These findings are broadly consistent with those of other studies evaluating guideline-based intraoperative antibiotics administration that have also reported low to modest adherence depending on the type of surgery and the study population investigated.

### Risk factors for multidrug resistant bacteria and optimization of empirical antibiotic therapy in postoperative peritonitis [^113tQX4b]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Postoperative peritonitis (PP) is a life-threatening complication of abdominal surgery with high rates of organ failure and mortality. Adequate management of patients with PP requires supportive therapy of organ dysfunction, source control of infection with surgery and/or drainage, and antimicrobial therapy. Because early and adequate antimicrobial therapy is an important goal in these high-risk patients, it is essential to take into account factors that modulate bacterial ecology and the susceptibility of causative organisms to ensure optimal management. Increased proportions of multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria have been reported in this setting and the role of previous antibiotic therapy in the emergence of these bacteria has been stressed. Interestingly, few studies have addressed the therapeutic issues and difficulties related to the choice of empirical antibiotic therapy (EA) raised by these MDR microorganisms.

Based on these concerns, the aim of this study was first to identify risk factors for the presence of MDR bacteria in PP, and then to analyse the in vitro activities of some antimicrobial regimens proposed by guidelines from the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) and the Surgical Infection Society (SIS) in order to propose antibiotic regimens providing adequate EA in the largest number of cases according to the identified risk factors of MDR bacteria.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for urinary tract infections after removal of urinary catheter: meta-analysis [^111qGc6S]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Urinary catheterization is common in patients in hospital, particularly for surgical patients in the perioperative period when physiological mechanisms of bladder emptying are suspended. Catheterization of the urinary tract, however, is associated with an increased risk of bacteriuria and symptomatic urinary tract infection, the risk being associated with the duration of catheterization. National guidelines recommend removal of urinary catheters once they are no longer needed, and surgical experts advocate discontinuation of catheterization as early as 24–48 hours postoperatively. Bacteriuria in a patient with a catheter, however, can persist after the catheter is removed and can develop into a symptomatic urinary tract infection. Manipulation of the catheter itself during removal might also predispose to infection. Current definitions' from the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) for catheter associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) reflect this by identifying infections up to 48 hours after catheter removal as catheter associated.

Whether administration of prophylactic antibiotics when the catheter is removed will prevent subsequent symptomatic urinary tract infection is unclear. Randomized trials have yielded conflicting results, and there has been no meta-analysis. Also, there is considerable heterogeneity in the management of antimicrobial prophylaxis around removal of a urinary catheter. The 2009 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of catheter associated urinary tract infection determined that there was insufficient evidence to recommend widespread antibiotic prophylaxis after catheterization. In contrast, in their 2008 best practice policy statement the American Urological Association (AUA) concluded that antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered for patients with bacteriuria at time of catheter removal, particularly for those with certain risk factors (such as advanced age, immunodeficiency, or anatomic abnormalities of the urinary tract).

We performed a meta-analysis of controlled trials to clarify whether antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of urinary catheter removal confers a benefit in terms of preventing subsequent symptomatic urinary tract infections.

### Antibiotic prescription practices for surgical prophylaxis in India: an observational study [^111eBYkk]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

Perioperative prophylactic antibiotics following surgeries have been shown to reduce surgical site infections, and their administration is common practice. Despite clear guidelines regarding this being set forth by the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), adherence to them is yet to translate to common practice in many parts of the world. A retrospective chart review of 409 patients who underwent elective surgeries over a period of 7 months at three different hospitals in India was performed. In-hospital antibiotic prescriptions of these patients were examined for any apparent inappropriateness (use of antibiotics with coverage broader than the target microbes and use of antibiotics with overlapping spectrum of target microbes). Four hundred ninety-five (48.9%) of the 1,012 patient intensive care unit (ICU) days had apparent inappropriateness in the choice of their prophylactic antibiotics and only 3.2% of the antibiotic units used were in accordance with the present IDSA guidelines. Injudicious use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for surgical prophylaxis is prevalent in low- and middle-income countries such as India. This poses the risk of emergence of resistant microorganisms in these areas and their potential spread across the borders. There is an acute need for diligent antibiotic stewardship programs in these areas to curb such practices.

### New WHO recommendations on preoperative measures for surgical site infection prevention: an evidence-based global perspective [^114MaF5d]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Surgical site infections (SSIs) are among the most preventable health-care-associated infections and are a substantial burden to health-care systems and service payers worldwide in terms of patient morbidity, mortality, and additional costs. SSI prevention is complex and requires the integration of a range of measures before, during, and after surgery. No international guidelines are available and inconsistencies in the interpretation of evidence and recommendations of national guidelines have been identified. Given the burden of SSIs worldwide, the numerous gaps in evidence-based guidance, and the need for standardisation and a global approach, WHO decided to prioritise the development of evidence-based recommendations for the prevention of SSIs. The guidelines take into account the balance between benefits and harms, the evidence quality, cost and resource use implications, and patient values and preferences. On the basis of systematic literature reviews and expert consensus, we present 13 recommendations on preoperative preventive measures.

### Ten golden rules for optimal antibiotic use in hospital settings: the WARNING call to action [^1156SRX6]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Using the shortest duration of antibiotics based on evidence

The duration of antibiotic therapy prescribed in daily practice is often longer than recommended by guidelines. WHO recommends against prolonging the administration of SAP after surgical intervention to prevent SSIs, based on a meta-analysis of 69 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the optimal duration of SAP. For clean and clean-contaminated procedures, CDC guidelines recommend not to give additional doses of prophylactic antibiotics after the surgical incision has been closed in the operating room, even in the presence of a drain. Updated guidelines of IDSA and SHEA recommend stopping all SAP at incision closure, regardless of procedure type or duration.

de Jonge et al. examined the effect of continued SAP on the rate of SSI. Eighty-three RCTs were evaluated; 52 (19,273 participants) were included in the primary meta-analysis. No conclusive evidence for the benefit of the post-operative continuation of antibiotic prophylaxis (vs. discontinuation) was identified. When combined with a comprehensive approach to best practices in SSI prevention, post-operative continuation of SAP produced no additional benefit in reducing the incidence of SSI in any surgical setting. In a 2019 multicenter retrospective cohort study, increased duration of antibiotic prophylaxis was associated with a higher risk of acute kidney injury and CDI, but no reduction in SSIs.

A study of 34 urban and rural South African hospitals demonstrated that implementation of process improvement initiatives and principles targeted to institutional needs, utilizing pharmacists, effectively improved SAP guideline compliance and sustainable patient outcomes. Efforts to shorten antibiotic therapy duration in hospital practice are a growing area of focus for ASPs. However, Langford et al. showed that ASP advice to stop antibiotics or reduce their duration was accepted less often than advice to start or increase antibiotic exposure.

Shortening the duration of antibiotic therapy is a crucial tactic for reducing unnecessary inpatient antibiotic use, where antibiotic pressure is intense. Although there are circumstances that may require prolonged antibiotic therapy (e.g. endocarditis, osteomyelitis), the duration of antibiotic therapy should always be as brief as possible. Regarding intra-abdominal infections, the STOP-IT trial demonstrated that, in the setting of adequate source control, 4 days of antibiotic therapy was non-inferior to 8 days of therapy. In the DURAPOP randomized clinical trial, critically ill patients with post-operative intra-abdominal infections treated with a short course of antibiotics (8 days) showed similar outcomes compared with those treated for 15 days.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^1151PCTJ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Importantly, the guidelines recommend that antibiotic prophylaxis should be used to prevent infections before and during surgery only. Antibiotics should not be used after surgery, as is often done. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be administered for operative procedures that have a high rate of postoperative surgical site infection, or when foreign materials are implanted. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be administered within 120 min prior to the incision. However, administration of the first dose of antibiotics is dependent on its pharmacological characteristics. Underlying patient factors may also affect drug disposition (e.g. malnourishment, obesity, cachexia, and renal disease with protein loss may result in suboptimal antibiotic exposure through increased antibiotic clearance in the presence of normal or augmented renal function). Additional antibiotic doses should be administered intraoperatively for procedures > 2–4 h (typically where duration exceeds two half-lives of the antibiotic). There is no evidence to support the use of postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis. The key evidence-based recommendations outlined in these guidelines should be adopted by all healthcare staff that care for surgical patients throughout all stages of that patient's surgical care.

### Thedefining a model for antimicrobial stewardship-results from an international cross-sectional survey [^113TqeEp]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Strategies of ASPs should be tailored based on individual hospital characteristics and personnel and resources available. The Infectious Diseases Society of America/Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (IDSA/SHEA) guidelines identified two core proactive evidence-based strategies and several supplemental strategies for promoting antimicrobial stewardship: first, a restrictive strategy based on a proactive strategy of either formulary restriction or a requirement for pre-approval for specific drugs or both, and second, a persuasive strategy of performing prospective audit with intervention and feedback to the prescriber.

Our survey showed that 23 (16.9%) surgical departments have developed persuasive interventions, 14 (10.3%) restrictive interventions and 99 (72.8%) both of them. ASP policies should be based on both international/national antibiotic guidelines, and tailored to local microbiology and resistance patterns. Local clinical practice guidelines and algorithms can be an effective way to standardize prescribing practices based on the country's epidemiology. Standardizing a shared protocol of antimicrobial prophylaxis should represent the first step of any Antimicrobial Stewardship program.

One hundred fifty-two (96.2%) participants stated their hospitals have a protocol for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis. Among the 158 hospitals, a protocol for antibiotic prophylaxis is present in all surgical wards in 124 (78.5%) of hospitals while only in some surgical wards in 28 (17.7%) hospitals.

A protocol for antibiotic treatment was present in all surgical wards in 70 (44.3%) hospitals, while only in some surgical wards in 60 (38.0%) hospitals. Among 130 hospitals implementing a protocol for antimicrobial treatment of surgical infections, 97 (74.6%) participants stated that it included interventions to reduce the duration of therapy, 88 (67.7%) interventions to switch select antimicrobials from intravenous-to-oral therapy, 78 (60.0%) interventions for alternative dosing strategies based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles, with substantial difference between community hospitals (11.1%, two-sided Fischer's exact test p < 0.05), university (57.0%) and community teaching (60.0%) ones. Thirty-five (26.9%) participants admitted to the use of biological markers - such as procalcitonin - to decrease antimicrobial use in critically ill patients.

Since the initial publication of A Compendium of Strategies to Prevent Healthcare-Associated Infections in Acute Care Hospitals in 2008, the prevention of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) has continued to be a national priority. Progress in healthcare epidemiology, infection prevention, antimicrobial stewardship, and implementation science research has led to improvements in our understanding of effective strategies for HAI prevention. Despite these advances, HAIs continue to affect ∼1 of every 31 hospitalized patients, leading to substantial morbidity, mortality, and excess healthcare expenditures, and persistent gaps remain between what is recommended and what is practiced. The widespread impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on HAI outcomes in acute-care hospitals has further highlighted the essential role of infection prevention programs and the critical importance of prioritizing efforts that can be sustained even in the face of resource requirements from COVID-19 and future infectious diseases crises. The Compendium: 2022 Updates document provides acute-care hospitals with up-to-date, practical expert guidance to assist in prioritizing and implementing HAI prevention efforts. It is the product of a highly collaborative effort led by the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA), the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC), the American Hospital Association (AHA), and The Joint Commission, with major contributions from representatives of organizations and societies with content expertise, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Pediatric Infectious Disease Society (PIDS), the Society for Critical Care Medicine (SCCM), the Society for Hospital Medicine (SHM), the Surgical Infection Society (SIS), and others.

Spine instrumentation

Question: what type and duration of perioperative antibiotics should be used for spinal surgery?

Recommendation

Preoperative antibiotics should be administered to decrease infection rates. Antibiotics should be redosed intraoperatively if spinal implants are being used but prolonged antibiotics are not required for high-risk patients or for spinal instrumentation. Cefazolin is often sufficient but high-risk patients may benefit from gram-negative coverage and/or application of intrawound vancomycin or gentamicin sponges.

Discussion

The North American Spine Society (NASS) recommends, based on several randomized and retrospective studies, a single dose of preoperative antibiotics to decrease infection rates for patients undergoing spine surgery without implants. Although several studies based largely on elective spinal surgery literature support a single dose of perioperative antibiotics, a prolonged postoperative course of antibiotics has not been shown to further decrease the rate of SSI and may even be associated with higher odds of CDI and prolonged hospital length of stay. Intraoperative redosing of surgical antibiotic prophylaxis has also been associated with a reduction in SSI in a broad range of surgical procedures, but no studies have directly compared intraoperative dosing versus no redosing for spinal surgery. The NASS, the Spine Intervention Society (SIS), and the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) all recommend redosing antibiotics if the duration of the procedure exceeds two half-lives of the drug or in the setting of excessive blood loss. Therefore, we recommend a preoperative dose of antibiotics with intraoperative redosing as needed for non-instrumented spine surgery.

Patients requiring instrumented fusions tend to have a higher rate of infection compared with those who do not receive spinal implants, and infection rates may be even higher in trauma patients, particularly those with spinal cord injuries. Therefore, the use of prophylactic antibiotics in instrumented spinal surgery in patients with or without cord injury is recommended. Meta-analysis of relevant trials has not identified an improved risk of SSI with the use of extended postoperative prophylaxis compared with preoperative prophylaxis alone. Therefore, a prolonged course of postoperative antibiotics does not appear to provide additional benefit over a preoperative dose (with intraoperative redosing to maintain therapeutic levels for prolonged procedures) for reducing postoperative infection rates. This holds true for high-risk patients as well. Patients with diabetes, obesity, age > 60 years old, active smokers, and previous surgical infection history are at high risk of SSI, but there is no proven benefit to a prolonged course of antibiotics in this high-risk population.

### Surgical site infection (SSI) [^113yw8wx]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Surgical Site Infection A surgical site infection is an infection that occurs after surgery in the part of the body where the surgery took place. Surgical site infections can sometimes be superficial infections involving the skin only. Other surgical site infections are more serious and can involve tissues under the skin, organs, or implanted material. CDC provides guidelines and tools to the healthcare community to help end surgical site infections and resources to help the public understand these infections and take measures to safeguard their own health when possible.
