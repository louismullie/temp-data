## Question

What murmur is associated with a bicuspid aortic valve?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what murmur is associated with a bicuspid aortic valve. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the classic auscultatory hallmarks directly linked to bicuspid morphology itself. Then, I should verify how the murmur changes when the valve is stenotic versus regurgitant. Next, I will check radiation patterns and associated sounds like an ejection click. Finally, I should ensure I qualify that some BAV patients have no murmur and synthesize a crisp take-home answer that reflects the spectrum of disease, not just a single finding [^113JYzWX] [^114NMCKe] [^117Tf56R].

> Let me first confirm the classic bedside findings attributable to the bicuspid valve anatomy itself: a high-pitched early systolic ejection click and a midsystolic ejection murmur are repeatedly described as characteristic clinical features of BAV, so I should anchor on those before layering in pathology-specific nuances [^113JYzWX].

> Hmm, wait a minute — my first instinct was to call it a holosystolic murmur, but hold on, that would more typically reflect mitral regurgitation rather than aortic outflow obstruction; I should correct that and emphasize the crescendo–decrescendo midsystolic ejection quality that matches turbulent flow across the abnormal aortic valve, often preceded by an ejection click in BAV [^113JYzWX].

> Next, I should review the murmur when BAV causes aortic stenosis, its most common pathologic evolution at younger ages; classically this is a crescendo–decrescendo systolic ejection murmur best heard at the right upper sternal border with radiation to the carotids, often late-peaking when severe, sometimes accompanied by a soft or diminished A2 and occasionally exhibiting the Gallavardin phenomenon at the apex, which fits both physiologic expectations and descriptions in aortic stenosis literature and case exemplars of congenitally abnormal aortic valves mimicking BAV on exam [^114NMCKe] [^111fx2iC].

> I need to check the scenario where BAV primarily causes aortic regurgitation; in that case, the expected finding is an early diastolic, high-frequency decrescendo murmur along the left sternal border, and when mixed disease is present one can hear both the systolic ejection murmur of stenosis and the diastolic AR murmur, occasionally producing a to-and-fro pattern on careful auscultation, which aligns with standard AR descriptions [^116nCNLo].

> But wait, let me verify the heterogeneity point so I don't overstate the presence of a murmur; a substantial proportion of adults with BAV have neither significant stenosis nor regurgitation at a given time, meaning they may have only an ejection click or even a normal exam without a pathologic murmur, which is supported by large echocardiographic cohorts reporting that many BAV patients have no AS and no AR at baseline [^117Tf56R] [^113JYzWX].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the most test-ready phrasing: the murmur most characteristically associated with a bicuspid aortic valve is a midsystolic (crescendo–decrescendo) ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border, often preceded by an ejection click and typically radiating to the carotids when stenosis is present; if the lesion is regurgitant, expect an early diastolic decrescendo murmur instead, and remember that some BAV patients have only a click or no murmur at all depending on valve function and hemodynamics [^113JYzWX] [^114NMCKe] [^116nCNLo] [^117Tf56R].

---

The murmur of a bicuspid aortic valve is typically a **mid-systolic ejection murmur** [^113JYzWX] best heard at the right upper sternal border, often with an **early systolic ejection click** and radiation to the carotids. It is usually grade 2–4/6, harsh, and crescendo–decrescendo [^114NMCKe], with a soft or paradoxically split S2; a diastolic decrescendo murmur may be present if there is regurgitation [^116nCNLo]. Diagnosis is confirmed by **echocardiography** [^114KfEDD], which also assesses valve function and aortic dimensions [^114uYXcT]; CT or MRI is used when echocardiography is inconclusive [^114QmoYE] or to evaluate the thoracic aorta [^113duc95]. Management includes **regular surveillance** [^112f5V3K] and **surgical intervention** [^112ikgY3] based on valve dysfunction severity and aortic diameter thresholds [^116uoB94].

---

## Auscultatory characteristics

BAV murmurs have **distinct auscultatory features**:

- **Timing**: Mid-systolic ejection murmur [^114NMCKe].

- **Location**: Best heard at the right upper sternal border (aortic area).

- **Radiation**: Frequently radiates to the carotid arteries [^114NMCKe].

- **Intensity**: Typically grade 2–4/6, harsh, crescendo–decrescendo.

- **Associated sounds**: Early systolic ejection click (especially in younger patients), soft or paradoxically split second heart sound (S2) [^113JYzWX].

- **Diastolic murmur**: Decrescendo murmur at the left sternal border if aortic regurgitation is present [^116nCNLo].

---

## Clinical significance

This murmur reflects turbulent flow from abnormal valve morphology [^114NMCKe], often progressing to **significant stenosis or regurgitation** [^117Tf56R], and is associated with complications such as aortic aneurysm, dissection [^1163L9s7], and infective endocarditis [^113JYzWX].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Echocardiography is the primary diagnostic tool [^114KfEDD], confirming BAV, assessing valve function, and measuring aortic dimensions [^114uYXcT]; **CT or MRI** is used when **echocardiography** is inconclusive [^114QmoYE] or to evaluate the thoracic aorta [^111mxEYZ].

---

## Management and follow-up

Management entails **regular surveillance** of valve function and aortic dimensions [^112f5V3K], with **surgical intervention** based on the severity of valve dysfunction and aortic diameter thresholds [^112ikgY3] [^1136fbqa].

---

The murmur associated with bicuspid aortic valve is a **mid-systolic ejection murmur** with specific auscultatory features, indicating turbulent flow due to abnormal valve morphology, and requires **echocardiographic confirmation** [^114KfEDD] and regular surveillance.

### Bicuspid aortic valve: a review with recommendations for genetic counseling [^116kTWPi]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2016). Low credibility.

Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital heart defect and falls within the spectrum of left-sided heart defects, also known as left ventricular outflow tract obstructive (LVOTO) defects. BAV is often identified in otherwise healthy, asymptomatic individuals, but it is associated with serious long-term health risks including progressive aortic valve disease (stenosis or regurgitation) and thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection. BAV and other LVOTO defects exhibit high heritability. Although recommendations for cardiac screening of BAV in at-risk relatives exist, there are no standard guidelines for providing genetic counseling to patients and families with BAV. This review describes knowledge of BAV and associated aortopathy and provides guidance to genetic counselors involved in the care of patients and families with these malformations. The heritability of BAV and recommendations for screening are highlighted. While this review focuses specifically on BAV, the principles are applicable to counseling needs for other LVOTO defects.

### Symptomatic unicuspid aortic valve [^111fx2iC]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

A 22-year-old man with typical angina was seeking medical attention at primary health clinics for a couple of months. Owing to his young age and the absence of coronary artery disease risk factors, he was assured of no serious problem. Proper examination at a referral center revealed weak peripheral pulses with diminished and delayed carotid upstroke. A normal S1 with a soft S2 were audible. A 3/6 late peaking systolic murmur was best heard in the aortic area radiating to the neck. Symptomatic bicuspid aortic valve disease was suspected. Diagnosis of a unicuspid aortic valve was established by transesophageal and three-dimensional echocardiography. The valve was successfully replaced with a mechanical prosthesis. The patient remains asymptomatic at 1-year follow-up.

### Management of echocardiography requests for the detection and follow-up of heart valve disease: A consensus statement from the British Heart Valve Society [^1161nxm9]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Recommendation 3**: Requests in asymptomatic murmur without a previous echocardiogram should use a basic/level 1 study to triage the need for a minimum standard TTE.

- **Background to recommendation 3**: In TTE indicated for a murmur, the yield of moderate or severe heart valve disease (HVD) is 11%–18%. Over half of the patients have no disease, and many do not even have a murmur when auscultated at a specialist murmur clinic. Differentiating a flow murmur from a pathological murmur from the request alone is usually impossible, as necessary characteristics, for example, a soft second heart sound, are not included. Furthermore, the accuracy of clinicians' auscultation skills is declining, making the original description of the murmur less reliable. It is, therefore, an inappropriate use of resources to perform comprehensive studies in all patients referred with a diagnosis of a murmur, as the majority will have no valve disease.

- **Implementation of recommendation 3**: The basic/level 1 study should be performed by a fully accredited and experienced clinical scientist or physiologist who can recognize signs of mild disease requiring a minimum standard TTE. One model, as used at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals, London, is a murmur clinic, but requests can also be included in a general basic/level 1 list. An alternative model is a focused study with "add-ons" of a pulmonary valve view and a color map of the ventricular septum in the 4-chamber view. Further time-saving measures can be arranged locally, using healthcare assistants to prepare patients for all scans, including basic/level 1 studies, an approach we highly recommend.

### Understanding and treating aortopathy in bicuspid aortic valve [^114mGYxM]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Bicuspid aortic valve is a simple yet common condition with surprising clinical complexity. Patients are typically found to have enlargement of the ascending aorta, either root or midascending, independent of valve function. This enlargement is perceived to be a risk of aortic dissection; therefore, prophylactic surgery is often recommended when the aorta reaches 50–55 mm in diameter. Despite the prevalence and potential health impact, there is, at the time of writing, no published data on the role of medical therapy. The emerging trend, however, is to address this question through clinical research.

Early trials are underway designed to address the question of potential medical therapy. This article reviews knowledge of the condition, its potential etiology, and ongoing work to assess the role of medical therapy.

### Restricted cusp motion in right-left type of bicuspid aortic valves: A new risk marker for aortopathy [^11146RDE]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Bicuspid aortic valve disease is heterogeneous with respect to valve morphology and aortopathy risk. This study searched for early imaging predictors of aortopathy in patients with a bicuspid aortic valve with right-left coronary cusp fusion, the most common morphotype.

- **Methods**: Time-resolved magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 36 subjects with nonstenotic, nonregurgitant bicuspid aortic valves and nondilated aortas and in 10 healthy controls with tricuspid aortic valves. Sinus dimensions (diameter, width, and height), ascending tract diameters, and wall strain were measured for each sinus/leaflet unit and corresponding ascending tract area to account for asymmetries. A novel parameter, "cusp opening angle", measured the degree of valve leaflet alignment to outflow axis in systole, quantifying cusp motility. Phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging and computational fluid dynamic models assessed flow patterns. Aortic growth rate was estimated over a follow-up period ranging from 9 to 84 months.

- **Results**: The expected restriction of bicuspid aortic valve opening (conjoint cusp opening angle, 62° ± 5° vs 76° ± 3° for nonfused leaflet and 75° ± 3° for tricuspid aortic valve cusps; p < 0.001) was confirmed, and the introduced parameter reproducibly quantified this phenomenon. Phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated systolic flow deflection toward the right, affecting the right anterolateral ascending wall. Computational models confirmed that restricted cusp motion alone is sufficient to cause the observed flow pattern. Ascending tract wall strain was measured, but the data is incomplete here.

### Congenital heart disease in aircrew [^112iBn8z]. Heart (2019). Low credibility.

Bicuspid aortic valve disease and coarctation

Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) disease is the most common form of congenital heart disease (CHD), with a prevalence of approximately 1%. It is often asymptomatic in childhood and found incidentally in adulthood; this is typically during a periodic medical examination (PME), where a systolic murmur may be detected in aircrew. Importantly, BAV disease is associated with the dilatation of the ascending aorta and aortic coarctation, both of which should be actively excluded in aircrew. Supra-aortic and sub-aortic stenosis are often related to more complex forms of CHD, which are likely to be disqualifying.

Congenital BAV encompasses a wide spectrum of pathology. The development and rate of progression of stenosis, regurgitation, and aortopathy associated with BAV is variable. Consequently, trained aircrew with BAV will require periodic follow-up more frequently than is generally recommended clinically. The lack of individual predictability in BAV disease progression, coupled with potential risks associated with the aviation environment, particularly those involving sustained +Gz acceleration, and the associated risk of endocarditis, means that many military employers would refrain from recruiting aircrew with known BAV disease. For individuals with aortopathy, surgical intervention may be required if the ascending aorta is dilated, and treatments such as β-blockers may lead to restriction or grounding of certain aircrew due to their potential impact on Gz tolerance.

In aircrew with coarctation of the aorta, unrestricted flying may be considered if the defect was surgically corrected and the individual demonstrates normal exercise capacity without hypertension or any obstructive gradient.

We report on a middle-aged woman treated for chronic hepatitis C virus infection with pegylated interferon. Auscultation revealed a diastolic murmur and the peripheral signs of aortic regurgitation. She had shortness of breath on moderate exertion for the past four months, which she attributed to her liver disease. An echocardiogram showed a quadricuspid aortic valve with severe aortic regurgitation. She was referred to a cardiothoracic surgeon for aortic valve replacement (AVR). However, she decided against AVR despite detailed counseling and opted for medical treatment.

### Bicuspid aortic valve and associated aortopathy: An update [^1144a12i]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common form of congenital heart disease, and most patients with BAV develop cardiovascular complications over time. Recent studies have shed light on one of the most common of these complications, BAV-associated aortopathy. Two distinct BAV phenotypes have been identified, which may have different causes for their associated aortopathy. Increasing evidence suggests that the BAV stenosis phenotype is predominantly secondary to hemodynamic perturbances in transvalvular flow and is associated with a more benign long-term prognosis once the stenotic BAV is replaced.

In contrast, the root phenotype, which is associated with aortic insufficiency, appears to have a genetic origin and may be associated with a higher risk of adverse aortic complications, irrespective of the extent of valvular disease. Such observations may have implications for patient decision-making. Future studies should be performed to better define phenotypes and risk factors for BAV-associated aortopathy.

Regarding surgical interventions for bicuspid aortic valve, and specifically with respect to indications for aortic replacement or repair, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend considering performing surgery at a maximum diameter ≥ 50 mm in patients with low surgical risk and ascending phenotype bicuspid aortopathy in case of any of the following conditions:

- **Age less than 50 years**: Young patients may benefit from early surgical intervention.

- **Shorter stature**: Body size can influence surgical decisions.

- **Ascending aortic length ≥ 11 cm**: A significant enlargement may necessitate surgery.

- **Aortic diameter growth rate ≥ 3 mm per year**: Rapid growth suggests increased risk.

- **Family history of acute aortic syndrome**: Genetic predispositions play a role.

- **Aortic coarctation**: This condition is often associated with bicuspid aortic valve issues.

- **Resistant hypertension**: Poorly controlled blood pressure can exacerbate conditions.

- **Concomitant non-aortic valve cardiac surgery**: Additional cardiac procedures can influence timing.

- **Desire for pregnancy**: Special considerations apply for women wishing to become pregnant.

### Bicuspid aortic valve disease [^1163L9s7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) disease is the most common congenital cardiac defect. While the BAV can be found in isolation, it is often associated with other congenital cardiac lesions. The most frequent associated finding is the dilation of the proximal ascending aorta secondary to abnormalities of the aortic media. Changes in the aortic media are present independent of whether the valve is functionally normal, stenotic, or incompetent. Although symptoms often manifest in adulthood, there is a wide spectrum of presentations, ranging from severe disease detected in utero to asymptomatic disease in old age.

Complications can include aortic valve stenosis or incompetence, endocarditis, aortic aneurysm formation, and aortic dissection. Despite the potential complications, two large contemporary series have demonstrated that life expectancy in adults with BAV disease is not shortened when compared with the general population. Because BAV is a disease of both the valve and the aorta, surgical decision-making is more complicated, and many undergoing aortic valve replacement will also need aortic root surgery. With or without surgery, patients with BAV require continued surveillance.

Recent studies have improved our understanding of the genetics, the pathobiology, and the clinical course of the disease, but questions are still unanswered. In the future, medical treatment strategies and the timing of interventions will likely be refined. This review summarizes our understanding of the pathology, genetics, and clinical aspects of BAV disease, with a focus on BAV disease in adulthood.

### Aortic valve function after bicuspidization of the unicuspid aortic valve [^1167QgTx]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Unicuspid aortic valve (UAV) anatomy leads to dysfunction of the valve in young individuals. We introduced a reconstructive technique of bicuspidizing the UAV. Initially, we copied the typical asymmetry of a normal bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) (I), and later we created a symmetric BAV (II). This study compared the hemodynamic function of the two designs of a bicuspidized UAV.

- **Methods**: Aortic valve function was studied at rest and during exercise in 28 patients after repair of UAV (group I, n = 8; group II, n = 20). There were no differences among the groups I and II with respect to gender, age, body size, or weight. All patients were in New York Heart Association class I. Six healthy adults served as control individuals. All patients were studied with transthoracic echocardiography between 4 and 65 months postoperatively. Systolic gradients were assessed by continuous wave Doppler while patients were at rest and exercising on a bicycle ergometer.

- **Results**: Aortic regurgitation was grade I or less in all patients. Resting gradients were significantly elevated in group I compared with group II and control individuals (group I, peak 33.8 ± 7.8 mm Hg; mean 19.1 ± 5.4 mm Hg; group II, peak 15.8 ± 5.4, mean 8.2 ± 2.8 mm Hg; control individuals, peak 6.0 ± 1.6, mean 3.2 ± 0.8 mm Hg; p < 0.001). At 100 W peak, gradients were highest in group I (group I, 62.7 ± 16.7 mm Hg; group II, 28.1 ± 7.6 mm Hg; control individuals: 15.4 ± 4.6 mm Hg; p < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: Converting a UAV into a symmetric bicuspid design results in adequate valve competence. A symmetric repair design was evaluated.

### Is there an association between bicuspid aortic valve and neuroblastoma [^111BySCy]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

An association has been reported between neuroblastoma and congenital heart disease, frequently bicuspid aortic valve [Holzer and Franklin. Arch Dis Child 2002;87:61–64; George et al. J Pediatr 2004;144:444–448; Friedman et al. Pediatr Cardiol 1998;19:480–481; Monte et al. Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol 1985;7:109–116]. To evaluate this in a large patient group with neuroblastoma, we examined echocardiograms of patients with neuroblastoma from 1987 to January 2007 to determine if there was a higher incidence of bicuspid aortic valves compared to the general population without neuroblastoma. We found that only 0.7% of neuroblastoma patients had the congenital heart defect of bicuspid aortic valves compared with 1–2% in the general population [Braverman et al. Curr Prob Cardiol 2005;30:470–522]. Our data show that neuroblastoma is not associated with bicuspid aortic valves.

### Bicuspid aortic valve: evolving knowledge and new questions [^1126Krfn]. Heart (2022). Low credibility.

Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), a common congenital anomaly with various morphological phenotypes, is characterized by marked heterogeneity in clinical presentations. These range from a clinically silent condition with mild valvulo-aortopathy to progressive valvulopathy and complex valvulo-aortopathy with shorter life expectancy. The clinical importance of using a general and unified nosology for BAV is well accepted by opinion leaders. An international consensus statement has recently been published to serve as an important scientific platform for BAV.

This review describes the knowledge of BAV based on clinical studies, addresses several unresolved issues requiring investigators' attention, and highlights the necessity of prospective studies with a very long follow-up duration for better appreciation of BAV-associated valvulo-aortopathy. In addition, the progression of valvular calcification in patients with BAV and its potential contribution to the development of valvulopathy will be discussed.

### Multimodality imaging in bicuspid aortic valve [^116LFugn]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) patients are at increased risk of valve dysfunction and ascending aorta aneurysm. Imaging techniques are essential to establish diagnosis, identify complications, and indicate surgical treatment. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the imaging technique of choice to diagnose BAV, valve morphotype, and valvular dysfunction in clinical practice. However, TTE can be less precise in assessing the aortic root and proximal ascending aorta. Visualization of the mid-distal ascending aorta and the arch may be difficult in some adults, where cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and computed tomography using multiplanar reconstructions are better at assessing aortic diameters.

Although valvular dysfunction varies significantly, almost half of the patients have more than mild aortic valve disease. TTE is the most effective and accurate test for evaluating the severity of valvular dysfunction and guiding appropriate management decisions. Aorta dilation is a common finding in patients with BAV. The pattern of aortic dimensions has been categorized into three aortic phenotypes: no-dilation phenotype, ascending aorta phenotype, and root phenotype. Controversial data exist regarding the relationship between BAV morphology and aorta dilation phenotype.

The assessment of aortic stiffness, through measuring distensibility or the velocity of propagation of flow, has garnered special interest to predict progressive aorta dilation. However, data indicate that BAV aortas do not show altered stiffness compared to those associated with a tricuspid valve with a similar condition.

### The bicuspid aortic valve condition: The critical role of echocardiography and the case for a standard nomenclature consensus [^111Dg3r4]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

The bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) condition is characterized by prominent heterogeneity in its valvular phenotypic expression, associated disorders, complications, and prognosis. Echocardiography serves as the first-line imaging modality in five major capacities: (1) BAV diagnosis, (2) valvular phenotyping, (3) assessment of valvular function, (4) measurement of the thoracic aorta and exclusion of aortic coarctation, and (5) assessment of uncommon but serious complications such as infective endocarditis and aortic dissection. This article presents a nosological perspective on the BAV condition, discusses the critical role of echocardiography as it relates to these five aforementioned capacities, and argues for a unified standard nomenclature for the BAV condition.

### Transcatheter aortic valve replacement in bicuspid aortic valve stenosis [^117QSHT3]. Circulation (2021). Low credibility.

After 15 years of successive randomized controlled trials, indications for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) are rapidly expanding. In the coming years, this procedure could become the first-line treatment for patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis and tricuspid aortic valve anatomy. However, randomized controlled trials have excluded bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), the most frequent congenital heart disease, affecting 1% to 2% of the total population and representing at least 25% of patients 80 years or older referred for aortic valve replacement.

Use of a less invasive transcatheter therapy in this elderly population became rapidly attractive, and approximately 10% of patients currently undergoing TAVR have a BAV. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the "European Conformity" have approved TAVR for low-risk patients regardless of the aortic valve anatomy, whereas international guidelines recommend surgical replacement in BAV populations. Given this progressive expansion of TAVR toward younger and lower-risk patients, heart teams are encountering BAV patients more frequently, while the ability of this therapy to treat such a challenging anatomy remains uncertain.

This review addresses the singularity of BAV anatomy and the associated technical challenges for the TAVR procedure. We examine and summarize available clinical evidence and highlight critical knowledge gaps regarding TAVR utilization in BAV patients. We also provide a comprehensive overview of the role of computed tomography scans in the diagnosis and classification of this condition.

### Transcatheter aortic valve replacement in intermediate- and low-risk patients [^1117kTZy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The prevalence of a bicuspid aortic valve in the general population is 1% to 2%, with a 2:1 male-to-female ratio. The specific genetic locus and protein abnormality in patients with a bicuspid aortic valve have not yet been identified; however, the tissue abnormality is not confined to the valve leaflets, and these patients are at increased risk of aortic aneurysm and dissection. Although most cases of bicuspid aortic valve are sporadic, familial clusters have been identified. The high incidence of familial clustering is suggestive of autosomal-dominant inheritance with reduced penetrance.

Nearly all patients with a bicuspid aortic valve will require valve surgery during their lifetime. A study of excised aortic valves revealed bicuspid morphology in 62% of patients aged 50 to 70 years undergoing isolated SAVR before the advent of TAVR. Bicuspid aortic valves are more prone to calcific degeneration leading to stenosis at a young age, and therefore, patients with bicuspid AS are likely to fall into low- and intermediate-risk categories.

Computed tomography analysis of aortic annulus and valve morphology demonstrates more eccentric annular calcification in bicuspid versus tricuspid valves (68% versus 32%). Consequently, TAVR could theoretically be associated with increased risk in patients with bicuspid versus tricuspid valves. First, the rate of moderate or severe PVL could be higher. Observational studies have reported PVL rates in bicuspid valves to range from 9.6% to 28.4%. However, careful valve sizing using cardiac computed tomography can mitigate these risks.

### Sex differences and survival in adults with bicuspid aortic valves: Verification in 3 contemporary echocardiographic cohorts [^114mDZ5s]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Despite the large size of our three cohorts and extended follow-up, the study design for all cohorts was retrospective, with its inherent limitations. However, retrospective identification of patients constitutes the only feasible method to assess long-term outcomes in BAV, as prospective long-term follow-up of large BAV cohorts is unrealistic due to financial costs and the duration over multiple decades to attain outcomes. The echocardiographic follow-up of the community cohort and some baseline echocardiographic features for the tertiary and surgical referral cohorts were not complete. However, sex patterns of valvular dysfunction and aorta dilatation observed in the community and tertiary referral cohorts were similar, and the surgical referral cohort confirmed these patterns reflected in congruent surgical indications for AVR and aorta surgery by sex. Specific BAV phenotype analysis was not available for the tertiary and surgical referral cohorts. Subjective biases of referring physicians cannot be accounted for and could be partially responsible for the observed sex differences in AVR-referral patterns. Although we estimate an accuracy of mortality ascertainment beyond 90%, the mortality differences between the general population and the BAV cohorts studied could still be underestimated.

We were not able to ascertain aortic dissection events in the tertiary and surgical cohorts; thus, sex differences regarding this important outcome remain unknown. We reported all-cause mortality (instead of cardiac death) for all cohorts.

### Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is more diagnostic than 2-dimensional echocardiography in determining the presence of bicuspid aortic valve [^111Fp45d]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

This study compares 2-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the preoperative identification of bicuspid aortic valve before aortic valve surgery.

- **Methods**: Of 1,203 patients who underwent an aortic valve operation, 218 had both preoperative transthoracic echocardiography and cardiac MRI. The study group had a mean age of 56 years, with an ejection fraction of 56%; 76% were male, and 29% had associated coronary artery disease. The results of transthoracic echocardiography and cardiac MRI were classified as bicuspid aortic valve, trileaflet aortic valve, or nondiagnostic. Of the 218 patients, 123 (56%) had a bicuspid aortic valve determined at the time of surgery, and 116 (53%) had an ascending aortic aneurysm.

- **Results**: Of the 123 patients with a bicuspid aortic valve confirmed at surgery, transthoracic echocardiography identified 76 (62%) preoperatively with a bicuspid aortic valve, misidentified 12 (10%) with a trileaflet aortic valve, and was nondiagnostic in 35 (28%) for valve morphology. In the same group, cardiac MRI identified 115 (93%) with a bicuspid aortic valve, misidentified 5 (4%) with a trileaflet aortic valve, and was nondiagnostic in 3 (2%). The difference between transthoracic echocardiography and cardiac MRI in determining the presence of a bicuspid aortic valve was statistically significant (p < 0.001).

Regarding surgical interventions for bicuspid aortic valve, more specifically with respect to indications for aortic replacement or repair, ACC/AHA 2022 guidelines recommend considering concomitant replacement of the aortic root, ascending aorta, or both. This should be performed by experienced surgeons in a multidisciplinary aortic team for patients with BAV undergoing surgical aortic valve repair or replacement, who have a diameter of the aortic root or ascending aorta of ≥ 45 mm.

### A critical review of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association practice guidelines on bicuspid aortic valve with dilated ascending aorta [^1139jQQi]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

The 2006 practice guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association recommend prophylactic aortic replacement for even an asymptomatic patient with a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) when the aortic dimensions exceed arbitrary ranges based on Marfan syndrome, without comparing risk estimates of aortic dissection with operative risks.

In the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection, which includes over 1,000 autopsied subjects, the average age is 63 years; BAVs are found in only 3%, compared with histories of hypertension in 72%. The risk for valve-sparing aortic replacement is 4% and that for late mortality is 10%, based on five publications.

The aortic dimensions are from guidelines for Marfan syndrome, with a proven genetic weakness of connective tissue, whereas no culprit genes have been demonstrated in BAV. Although cystic medial necrosis is seen in dilated aortas associated with Marfan syndrome and BAV, it is also seen in dilated aortas with other causes. There is no convincing proof that cystic medial necrosis causes dissection or is simply an effect of dilatation.

BAV is not associated with dilatation of the pulmonary arteries, in contrast to Marfan syndrome. Hemodynamic explanations for the dilatation of the ascending aorta have been largely ignored because of a belief that it requires severe aortic stenosis or regurgitation. In conclusion, vascular dilatation without a genetic weakness is caused by coarse periodic vibrations from even trivial valve disorders, demonstrated experimentally.

### Sex differences and survival in adults with bicuspid aortic valves: Verification in 3 contemporary echocardiographic cohorts [^112GXGxi]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital heart defect, and aortic valve replacement (AVR) is its most frequent long-term complication, with over 50% of patients requiring AVR 25 years after BAV diagnosis. Over 25% of BAV patients also develop ascending aorta aneurysms (AA) 25 years after BAV diagnosis, with cohort risks of aortic dissection ranging from 0.5% to 1%. In addition, infective endocarditis (IE) is observed in approximately 2% of contemporary BAV cohorts.

Although the BAV condition begins at birth, the echocardiographic-clinical evolution of most adults with BAV begins at echocardiographic diagnosis in young adulthood, followed by continued surveillance of BAV dysfunction and/or AA locally or via tertiary clinical referral. For over 50% of BAV adults, the subsequent evolving echocardiographic-clinical stage involves surgical referral for AVR.

Beyond the fact that BAV is more frequent in men than women, sex-specific morbidity and survival patterns in BAV adults remain fundamentally unknown. In addition, contemporary assessment of long-term survival in BAV patients has involved young patient cohorts, frequently identified at the time of BAV diagnosis, and has included children. The resulting survival rates have been identical to those in the general population, suggesting a benign prognosis for BAV patients.

Nonetheless, whether BAV cohorts identified at subsequent echocardiographic-clinical stages beyond the diagnosis stage could incur survival penalties remains undetermined. Therefore, investigation into this area is crucial.

Regarding surgical interventions for bicuspid aortic valve, specifically with respect to indications for aortic replacement or repair, ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines recommend considering performing operative intervention. If performed at a comprehensive valve center, it is advised to replace the aortic sinuses and/or the ascending aorta in asymptomatic patients with BAV who have low surgical risk. This is recommended for those with a diameter of the aortic sinuses or ascending aorta measuring 50–55 mm and without additional risk factors for dissection.

### Murmur clinic: Validation of a new model for detecting heart valve disease [^117Njb84]. Heart (2019). Low credibility.

Auscultation was classed as normal if there was no murmur heard or a likely benign systolic flow murmur (soft, short ejection systolic murmur with a well-heard second sound). It was deemed abnormal if there was a loud, long ejection systolic murmur, or a soft, absent second sound, or a pansystolic or diastolic murmur. The point-of-care scan was classified as normal if there was no more than minimal thickening or trivial regurgitation. It was classified as abnormal if there was anything more than mild thickening or trivial regurgitation.

The TTE was categorized as normal, mildly abnormal (advised to have serial TTE after 3 years as per international guidelines), moderately abnormal (offered follow-up in a specialist valve clinic), and severely abnormal (requiring an immediate cardiology opinion). For the purposes of comparison with auscultation or point-of-care echocardiography, the three grades of abnormal (mild, moderate, and severe) were combined.

The mean age was calculated. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, accuracy, and positive and negative likelihood of auscultation and point-of-care scans against standard echocardiography were calculated. Comparison of results for auscultation and point-of-care scans against standard TTE was with a two-tailed exact McNemar's test. The results of auscultation between scientist and cardiologist were analyzed using a two-sided Fisher's exact test. Calculations were performed using Stata V.14.2. Costs were estimated using the National Health Service tariff of £81.73 for a standard simple echocardiography.

### Bicuspid aortic valve disease: a comprehensive review [^115jMiaN]. Cardiology Research and Practice (2012). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on bicuspid aortic valve (BAV):

- **Definition**: BAV is a common congenital cardiac abnormality consisting of two cusps instead of the usual three, characterized by dilatation of the thoracic aorta.

- **Pathophysiology**: The exact cause of BAV is unknown; however, genetic causes such as Anderson syndrome and NOTCH1 mutation have been implicated.

- **Disease course**: The fusion of the aortic cusps during valvulogenesis results in BAV, which can manifest clinically as severe aortic stenosis (symptoms include dyspnea, syncope, and chest pain), aortic regurgitation, aortic incompetence, aortopathy leading to aneurysm and dissection, and infective endocarditis, or it can remain asymptomatic.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: BAV in patients with definite infective endocarditis of the native aortic valve is associated with a 9% in-hospital mortality.

### Aortic valve regurgitation: A comprehensive review [^116nCNLo]. Current Problems in Cardiology (2018). High credibility.

Aortic regurgitation is a disease associated with various signs and conditions. Notably, it can present with an aortic regurgitation murmur, Gerhardt's sign, Marfan syndrome, Mayne's sign, Corrigan pulse, and a third heart sound. Other associated conditions include SLE and syncope, as well as Quincke's sign, marked by an increased volume of murmur during transient arterial occlusion, and hypotension. Patients may also exhibit a diastolic cardiac murmur, leg swelling, de Musset's sign, Duroziez's sign, and peripheral hemodynamic signs of aortic insufficiency (AI).

- **Clinical history and symptoms**: Include a clinical impression of heart failure (HF), history of aortic valve surgery or intervention, increased popliteal-brachial gradient, and conditions such as Takayasu arteritis, aortic dissection, and osteogenesis imperfecta. Common symptoms also include fatigue, Müller's sign, chest pain, flow reversal in the descending aorta, dyspnea, rheumatic heart disease, and a bicuspid aortic valve.

- **Additional signs**: Palpitations, reactive arthritis, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, increased pulse pressure, ankle swelling, cardiomegaly, and infective endocarditis. The Austin-Flint murmur and angina pectoris are also noted symptoms. It is important to recognize these signs for diagnosis and management of the condition.

### Association between bicuspid aortic valve phenotype and patterns of valvular dysfunction: A meta-analysis [^111NRBwY]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Statistical analyses and risk of bias assessment were conducted using the presented meta-analysis with Statistica 15.1. The frequency variable is expressed as n (%). Differences among aortic stenosis (AS) and aortic regurgitation (AR) between the two types of bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) patients were expressed as odds ratio (OR) with pertinent 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous variables. The overall effect was tested using Z scores, with significance set at p < .05. Statistical heterogeneity among studies was assessed with the chi-square Cochran's Q test and the I² statistic, which measures inconsistency across study results and describes the proportion of total variation in study estimates. To evaluate the individual impact of each study on the overall effect size, sensitivity analysis was conducted using the leave-one-out approach by estimating the weighted mean difference in the absence of each single study.

The presence of publication bias was evaluated using Egger's weighted regression tests and Begg's rank correlation. Publication bias was also visually assessed by inspecting funnel plots of standard error (SE) and mean difference asymmetry. Visual inspection of funnel plot asymmetry was performed to address possible small-study effect, as well as the Egger test to address publication bias, beyond any subjective evaluation. Statistical significance was considered at p < .05.

### The bicuspid aortic valve: Still a toothy problem [^112gxhD1]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). Low credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an acceptable treatment alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement in selected patients with a bicuspid aortic valve. TAVR appears to have acceptable mid-term outcomes in patients with bicuspid aortic stenosis. A large-scale, randomized clinical trial is necessary to better define the role of TAVR for patients with bicuspid aortic stenosis.

### Effect of bicuspid versus tricuspid aortic valve morphology on the fate of the ascending aorta [^1135PD3b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Low credibility.

Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital heart abnormality, with a prevalence of approximately 1%. Patients with BAV more frequently develop aortic valvular pathologies and have a 50% risk of requiring cardiac surgery throughout their lifetime due to valvular disease. Furthermore, patients with BAV have an increased risk of developing aortic aneurysms, a condition commonly referred to as BAV aortopathy. The pathophysiology behind BAV aortopathy is not fully understood but is suggested to be of embryonic origin and likely involves both genetics and hemodynamic disturbances.

According to European and American guidelines, concomitant ascending aortic surgery in patients with BAV undergoing aortic valve replacement should be considered in patients with an aortic diameter of > 50 mm and > 45 mm, respectively. This prophylactic surgery on the ascending aorta is aimed at decreasing the risk of adverse aortic events, such as aortic dissection and rupture. However, as reflected by the difference in aortic diameter threshold between the American and European guidelines, sufficient knowledge to identify patients at risk for adverse aortic events is lacking. Although aortic diameter is indeed a predictor for adverse aortic events, patients with normal diameters are not exempt from risk. Studies investigating the fate of the aorta in terms of aortic diameter growth and adverse events in relation to valve morphology are still sparse and mostly consist of small cohorts with limited follow-up. Therefore, we performed a prospective cohort study to evaluate these outcomes.

### Transcatheter aortic valve replacement in bicuspid aortic valve stenosis [^1173Anxf]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital cardiac abnormality in adults, with symptoms typically developing in adulthood. In the majority of cases, BAV disease progresses with age, and surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) is performed with excellent operative outcomes. Based on a series of randomized trials, transcatheter AVR (TAVR) has evolved from a novel technology to an established therapy for patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS), regardless of risk profile.

Despite the exclusion of bicuspid anatomy from the randomized trials, an increasing number of patients with BAV-AS have been treated with TAVR. Recent observational studies have shown comparable outcomes of TAVR between bicuspid and tricuspid AS. However, worse outcomes in patients with unfavorable bicuspid anatomy, such as calcified raphe and excessive leaflet calcification, have raised concerns about TAVR in younger and lower-risk populations.

To further expand TAVR toward the BAV-AS population, randomized trials in this population are needed. Until then, previous registry data, combined with computed tomographic-based anatomical assessments, may guide optimal therapy in patients with bicuspid anatomy.

### An unusual cause of aortic regurgitation in a patient with bicuspid aortic valve [^116KLgLg]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2023). High credibility.

Aortic fibrous strands are considered residual tissue from aortic valve development. Rupture of these strands is an important albeit uncommon cause of aortic regurgitation (AR). The authors describe a 67-year-old man who was admitted to the authors' hospital with a sudden onset of shortness of breath and diagnosed with severe AR. The patient was scheduled for Bentall surgery. The transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) found multiple fibrous strands that were present in multiple locations of the aortic valve, some of which were ruptured. Ruptured fibrous strands are in the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with acute AR without a more conventional explanation, and TEE is instrumental in securing the diagnosis.

### A stepwise approach to bicuspid aortic valve repair and reimplantation [^116ftx54]. JTCVS Techniques (2025). Low credibility.

- **Preoperative assessment**: Preoperative evaluation includes echocardiograms and contrast-enhanced computed tomography. Transthoracic echocardiograms help indicate surgery, whereas transesophageal echocardiograms (TEEs) offer detailed valve views and the regurgitant mechanism. Computed tomography confirms aortic dimensions and detects leaflet calcification. Additional tests like electrocardiograms and coronary angiograms are performed as part of the routine preoperative assessment.

- **AV exposure and assessment**: Following distal aortic and right atrial cannulation and institution of cardiopulmonary bypass, myocardial protection is achieved with a combination of retrograde and antegrade cardioplegia. The AV is accessed via a transverse aortotomy. Full-thickness commissural sutures expose the valve. BAVs usually have fused cusps, most commonly right-left fusion. A thorough evaluation identifies cusp thickening, calcification, fenestrations, and mobility, with annular and root assessment crucial to repair planning. The repairability of the AV is dependent on the quantity and quality of the cusp tissue available. In particular, the mobility of the nonconjoint cusp is critical to valve function and should have a geometric height ≥ 20 mm. Annular dilation preferentially affects the muscular portion of the aortic annulus and is frequently associated with thinning of the aortic wall in that region.

- **Cusp repair prereimplantation**: Initial cusp repair focuses on cusp preparation without altering its geometry. At the time of operation, repair is focused on…

### Frequency of bicuspid aortic valve in young male conscripts by echocardiogram [^116dpyGY]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

The database of echocardiographic examinations performed during the military screening of 20,946 young men in northeastern Italy was systematically reviewed to assess the frequency, hemodynamic characteristics, and aortic sizes of subjects with bicuspid aortic valves (BAVs). One hundred sixty-seven patients with BAVs were identified (0.8%), of whom 80 (48%) were diagnosed de novo during military screening. Aortic insufficiency was the predominant hemodynamic lesion in 110 subjects (66%), mild in 90, and moderate to severe in 20. Patients with BAVs displayed larger aortic sizes than controls at each aortic level, and the degree of dilation was related to the presence but not the severity of aortic insufficiency.

### Inherited thoracic aortic disease: New insights and translational targets [^111QB8Rh]. Circulation (2020). Low credibility.

Bicuspid aortic valve aortopathy, abnormal aortic development, and abnormal flow: Bicuspid aortic valve affects 0.5% to 2% of the population and denotes an aortic valve composed of two, rather than three, aortic leaflets. Patients with bicuspid aortic valve are at increased risk of aortic stenosis and regurgitation and are significantly more likely to experience ascending aortic dilatation and acute aortic events. The mechanisms that predispose patients with bicuspid aortic valve to aortopathy are still emerging, with evidence supporting both biomechanical and genetic causes. Multiple studies have demonstrated the important influence that abnormal thoracic aortic flow patterns have on underlying aortic wall TGFβ pathway signaling, elastin breakdown, dilatation location, and the risk of aortic events.

There are sex and racial differences in the prevalence of bicuspid aortic valve, with men and white individuals the most likely to be affected. Furthermore, there is clustering of affected individuals within families, strongly suggesting an inherited disease process. Yet, similar to nsHTAD, in the majority of cases, no definite genetic cause can be found. In those patients with mutations known to affect normal aortic development, for example, FBN1 or TGFβ pathway mutations, there is an increased prevalence of bicuspid aortic valve, suggesting an inherent link between bicuspid aortic valve formation and thoracic aortopathy in these groups. Furthermore, there is a growing number of reports describing specific mutations in patients with this condition.

### Surgery for aortic dilatation in patients with bicuspid aortic valves: A statement of clarification from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^113vboMg]. Circulation (2016). High credibility.

Two guidelines from the American College of Cardiology (ACC), the American Heart Association (AHA), and collaborating societies address the risk of aortic dissection in patients with bicuspid aortic valves and severe aortic enlargement: the 2010 ACCF/AHA/AATS/ACR/ASA/SCA/SCAI/SIR/STS/SVM guidelines for the diagnosis and management of patients with thoracic aortic disease (Circulation. 2010;121:e266-e369) and the 2014 AHA/ACC guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease (Circulation. 2014;129:e521-e643).

However, the two guidelines differ with regard to the recommended threshold of aortic root or ascending aortic dilatation that would justify surgical intervention in patients with bicuspid aortic valves. The ACC and AHA therefore convened a subcommittee representing members of the two guideline writing committees to review the evidence, reach consensus, and draft a statement of clarification for both guidelines. This statement of clarification uses the ACC/AHA revised structure for delineating the class of recommendation and level of evidence to provide recommendations. These recommendations replace those contained in Section 9.2.2.1 of the thoracic aortic disease guideline and Section 5.1.3 of the valvular heart disease guideline.

### Characteristics of bicuspid aortic valve disease and stenosis: The National Echo Database of Australia [^117Tf56R]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital heart disease in adults but is clinically heterogeneous. We aimed to describe the echocardiographic characteristics of BAV and compare patients with BAV with moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis (AS) with those with tricuspid aortic valve (TAV) stenosis.

- **Methods and results**: Using the National Echo Database of Australia, patients in whom BAV was identified were studied. Those with moderate-to-severe AS (mean gradient > 20 mm Hg [BAV-AS]) were compared with those with TAV and moderate-to-severe AS (TAV-AS). Of 264,159 adults whose aortic valve morphology was specified, 4783 (1.8%) had confirmed BAV (aged 49.6 ± 17.4 years, 69% men). Of these, 42% had no AS, and 46% had no aortic regurgitation. Moderate-to-severe AS was detected in a greater proportion of patients with BAV with a recorded mean gradient (n = 1112, 34%) compared with those with TAV (n = 4377, 4%; P < 0.001). Patients with BAV-AS were younger (aged 55.3 ± 16.7 years versus 77.3 ± 11.0 years; P < 0.001), and where measured, had larger ascending aortic diameters (37 ± 8 mm versus 35 ± 5 mm; P < 0.001). Age and sex-adjusted mortality risk was significantly lower in patients with BAV-AS (hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.45–0.63; P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: In this large study of patients across the spectrum of BAV disease, the largest proportion had no significant valvulopathy or aortopathy. Compared with those with TAV-AS, patients with BAV were more likely to have moderate-to-severe AS, have larger ascending aortas, and were over two decades younger at the time of AS diagnosis.

### Sports participation and exercise restriction in children with isolated bicuspid aortic valve [^115Z9MpF]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Our study aimed to apply the 2015 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Athletic Participation Guidelines to a group of otherwise healthy school-age children and young adults with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and describe the potential competitive sports restriction as they age. We performed a retrospective chart review of children and young adults aged 5 to 22 years with isolated BAV, with at least two echocardiograms between 2000 and 2013. Using task force guidelines, exercise restriction was recommended for any of the following: (1) any dilation of the aortic root, (2) any dilation of the ascending aorta, (3) moderate aortic stenosis, (4) severe aortic regurgitation, (5) left ventricular dilation, or (6) reduced shortening fraction.

Of the 345 patients with isolated BAV, 202 were considered restricted at study entry. The final cohort included 123 children and young adults. Over the course of follow-up, 36% (44 of 123) met restriction criteria, with aortic dilation being the most likely cause for restriction (34%). Progression of aortic valve disease occurred in a minority of patients (3%). There were no reports of death, dissection, or catheter or surgical-based interventions. In conclusion, we found that strict adherence to guidelines would result in the restriction of more than 1/3 of school-age children and young adults with BAV from some form of competitive athletics during their school years. Strict application of the guidelines in this age group may lead to the over-restriction of youths from competitive sports.

Two guidelines from the American College of Cardiology (ACC), the American Heart Association (AHA), and collaborating societies address the risk of aortic dissection in patients with bicuspid aortic valves and severe aortic enlargement: the "2010 ACCF/AHA/AATS/ACR/ASA/SCA/SCAI/SIR/STS/SVM Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Patients With Thoracic Aortic Disease" (J Am Coll Cardiol 2010;55:e27–130) and the "2014 AHA/ACC Guideline for the Management of Patients With Valvular Heart Disease" (J Am Coll Cardiol 2014;63:e57–185). However, the two guidelines differ with regard to the recommended threshold of aortic root or ascending aortic dilatation that would justify surgical intervention in patients with bicuspid aortic valves.

The ACC and AHA therefore convened a subcommittee representing members of the two guideline writing committees to review the evidence, reach consensus, and draft a statement of clarification for both guidelines. This statement of clarification uses the ACC/AHA revised structure for delineating the Class of Recommendation and Level of Evidence to provide recommendations that replace those contained in Section 9.2.2.1 of the thoracic aortic disease guideline and Section 5.1.3 of the valvular heart disease guideline.

### Should functional cardiac murmurs be diagnosed by auscultation or by Doppler echocardiography [^116kgfrL]. Clinical Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

For many years, cardiac auscultation has been the only available method for distinguishing between functional and organic murmurs; however, a more reliable differential diagnosis can now be achieved with Doppler echocardiography. The question remains as to whether a Doppler echocardiogram needs to be routinely recorded in the presence of a heart murmur or whether the auscultatory diagnosis of a functional murmur is sufficient.

- **Hypothesis**: This prospective study attempts to answer this important question at a time when medical costs have to be curbed.

- **Methods**: The three cardiologists involved in this study saw 516 new patients in their private practice over a 10-month period; of these, 321 (63.6%) underwent Doppler echocardiography. All patients underwent careful auscultation prior to echocardiography. At the end of their examinations, the cardiologists noted whether they considered the murmur to be of functional or organic origin. Minimal mitral or aortic regurgitations of short duration and low velocity occurring on non-thickened valves were considered functional.

- **Results**: The results for cardiac auscultation and Doppler echocardiography were considered to be concordant, meaning both techniques diagnosed either a functional or organic murmur in 250 of 321 patients (77.9%). The results for cardiac auscultation and Doppler echocardiography showed a major discordance in just six cases (1.9%). All were mitral regurgitations of moderate severity.

- **Conclusion**: The prevalence of cardiac murmurs in the general population is very high. As echocardiography currently.

### A 40-year-old man with bicuspid aortic valve and huge LV [^113fbNWK]. Heart (2015). Low credibility.

A 40-year-old man presented to our institute with progressive exertional dyspnea for one year. Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) with mild-to-moderate aortic regurgitation (AR) was diagnosed in his childhood by echocardiography, but he declined follow-up afterward. Physical examination revealed a grade 3/6 'to-and-fro' murmur at the third left intercostal space. The chest radiograph showed an extremely enlarged cardiac silhouette (Figure 1A), and ECG displayed complete left bundle branch block with frequent premature ventricular contractions. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated an extremely enlarged left ventricle (LV) with an end-diastolic volume of 472 mL and an ejection fraction (EF) of 20% (see Figure 1B, C and online supplementary video 1).

### Presence of a congenitally bicuspid aortic valve among patients having combined mitral and aortic valve replacement [^115ohTjt]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Although bicuspid aortic valve occurs in an estimated 1% of adults and mitral valve prolapse in an estimated 5% of adults, the occurrence of both in the same patient is infrequent. During the examination of operatively excised aortic and mitral valves due to dysfunction (stenosis and/or regurgitation), we encountered 16 patients with congenitally bicuspid aortic valves associated with various types of dysfunctional mitral valves.

- **Aortic stenosis (AS)**: Eleven of the 16 patients had aortic stenosis. Five of these patients also had mitral stenosis, with a rheumatic origin in four cases and secondary to mitral annular calcium in one case. The other six patients with aortic stenosis had pure mitral regurgitation (MR), secondary to mitral valve prolapse in three cases, ischemia in two cases, and unclear origin in one case.

- **Aortic regurgitation**: Of the five patients with pure aortic regurgitation, each also had pure mitral regurgitation. In one case, this was secondary to mitral valve prolapse, and in four cases, it was secondary to infective endocarditis.

In conclusion, various types of mitral dysfunction severe enough to warrant mitral valve replacement occur in patients with bicuspid aortic valves. A proper search for mitral valve dysfunction in patients with bicuspid aortic valves appears warranted.

### Surgical strategy for the bicuspid aortic valve: Tricuspidization with cusp extension versus pulmonary autograft [^11168oCm]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

The congenitally bicuspid aortic valve is the most common etiologic factor associated with clinically significant aortic stenosis and/or regurgitation in pediatric patients. Beyond infancy, surgical intervention typically involves valve repair with cusp thinning and commissurotomy or valve replacement, primarily with a pulmonary autograft in the era. An aortic valve repair technique using tricuspidization with cusp extension was introduced in 1999. This study compares the midterm clinical outcome in patients undergoing valve repair by tricuspidization with cusp extension with those receiving a pulmonary autograft (Ross).

- **Methods**: A retrospective study was performed on all consecutive patients with symptomatic bicuspid aortic valve disease who underwent tricuspidization with cusp extension or a Ross procedure between 1999 and 2005. In both groups, all patients were at least 1 year of age at the time of the operation.

- **Results**: During this period, 21 children (median age 12.6 years, range 2.6–18 years) underwent tricuspidization with cusp extension (TCE group), and 25 children (median age 10.2 years, range 11.5 months-20.1 years) underwent the Ross procedure. Prior balloon valvuloplasty was performed in 5 (24%) of the children in the TCE group and in 16 (64%) of the children in the Ross group. Prior surgical commissurotomy was performed in 4 (19%) TCE patients and in 9 (36%) Ross patients. During a median follow-up period of 36.4 months (range 2.5 months-7.4 years), 2 (10%) patients in the TCE group required valve-preserving early revision of the repair.

### Cusp repair techniques in bicuspid and tricuspid aortic valves [^11723qFn]. JTCVS Techniques (2021). Low credibility.

Various techniques are available for aortic cusp and valve repair. An individualized approach should be taken owing to the diverse valvular morphology and pathophysiology.

Aortic regurgitation (AR) is one of the most prevalent cardiac valvular diseases, affecting up to 13% of the population. The pathophysiology of AR is dependent on the acuity of the disease and the dysfunction of the aortic valvular apparatus. Functionally, AR can be classified into:

- **Type I**: Normal cusp motion but dilated functional aortic annulus (FAA) or cusp perforation.
- **Type II**: Cusp prolapse due to excess cusp tissue or commissural disruption.
- **Type III**: Cusp restriction typically seen in bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), degenerative, or rheumatic valvular disease.

This functional AR classification allows a systematic approach to the surgical treatment options for AR. On the transcriptional level, AR valves are associated with unique gene expression patterns compared with normal aortic valves. These findings may help guide the development of novel gene editing therapies for patients with AR.

The specific indications for aortic valve repair have not been standardized. Rather, the guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association focus on overall aortic valve intervention. Although aortic valve replacement has been a mainstay of therapy for decades, choosing between a mechanical or bioprosthetic replacement valve involves complex decision-making processes.

### Aortic root replacement for bicuspid aortic valve dysfunction does not impair survival rates [^1127UPuu]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). High credibility.

A bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital heart anomaly, with a population prevalence of 1–2%. The risk of aortic valve dysfunction and aortic dilatation is often encountered in the clinical course of BAV patients, with a prevalence of up to 80%. Aortic dilatation, in particular, warrants frequent monitoring since it may evolve into life-threatening conditions such as aortic dissection or rupture. Two hypotheses are generally considered regarding the pathophysiology of aortic dilatation in BAV patients: the genetic and the hemodynamic.

While the hemodynamic component, caused by aberrant flow patterns through the altered aortic valve morphology, is resolved after an aortic valve replacement (AVR), the genetic component requires a more aggressive approach, including additional aortic replacement. A lower threshold for aortic replacement is already advised when concomitant aortic valve surgery is indicated. However, an even lower threshold might be considered for BAV as is the case for connective tissue disorders. In patients with a highly progressive disease course, including an aortic dilatation rate of more than 5 mm in 12 months, intervention is advised even when the aortic diameters are below the thresholds for intervention.

The prophylactic nature of a more aggressive approach towards BAV aortopathy necessitates a good understanding of its impact on survival. Therefore, this study compares the results of an aortic root replacement with that of isolated AVR in BAV patients with an indication for an AVR.

### The American Association for Thoracic Surgery consensus guidelines on bicuspid aortic valve-related aortopathy: Executive summary [^112cPziv]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Bicuspid aortic valve disease is a common congenital cardiac disorder, affecting 1% to 2% of the general population. Associated aortopathy is frequently observed in patients with this condition, with thoracic aortic dilation noted in approximately 40% of cases in referral centers. Previous consensus statements and guidelines have addressed the management of bicuspid aortic valve-associated aortopathy; however, none have focused entirely on this disease process.

This document is an executive summary of "The American Association for Thoracic Surgery Guidelines on Bicuspid Aortic Valve-Related Aortopathy", and it covers all major aspects of bicuspid aortic valve aortopathy. These aspects include natural history, phenotypic expression, histology and molecular pathomechanisms, imaging, indications for surgery, surveillance, follow-up, and future research recommendations. The executive summary provides clinicians with a comprehensive review of bicuspid aortic valve aortopathy to guide the daily management of these complex patients.

### Genotype-phenotype correlation in patients with bicuspid aortic valve and aneurysm [^111XeqSX]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Bicuspid aortic valve is the most common congenital cardiac abnormality, occurring in 1% to 2% of the population, and is often associated with ascending aortic aneurysm. Based on familial studies, bicuspid aortic valve with aneurysm segregates in an autosomal dominant manner with incomplete penetrance. NOTCH1 mutations have been reported in six families with prominent valve calcification and dysfunction and low penetrance of aneurysm. This study aimed to determine the contribution of NOTCH1 mutations to the more common phenotype of highly penetrant aneurysms with low penetrance of bicuspid aortic valve and with rare valve calcification or dysfunction.

- **Methods**: All exons and splice junctions of NOTCH1 were sequenced in probands from 13 affected families presenting with bicuspid aortic valve with ascending aortic aneurysm in the absence of valve calcification. In addition, mutation analysis was performed on a single individual with aneurysm and calcified tricuspid aortic valve. Sequences were aligned and compared with the reference genomic sequence.

- **Results**: Corroborating previous studies, analysis of the single sporadic patient with calcified aortic valve in the presence of ascending aortic aneurysm revealed a novel heterozygous missense mutation in NOTCH1, resulting in a nonsynonymous amino acid substitution (p.T1090S, c.C3269G) of an evolutionarily conserved residue. This change was not observed in controls. In contrast, no pathologic NOTCH1 mutations were identified in the 13 families segregating non-calcified bicuspid aortic valve with highly penetrant aortic aneurysm.

### 2022 ACC/AHA guideline for the diagnosis and management of aortic disease: A report of the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116n9n2N]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for bicuspid aortic valve, specifically with respect to indications for aortic replacement or repair, ACC/AHA 2022 guidelines recommend considering surgery to replace the aortic root, ascending aorta, or both. This should be performed by experienced surgeons in a multidisciplinary aortic team for patients with BAV, a diameter of the aortic root or ascending aorta of 50–54 mm, no other risk factors for aortic dissection, and who are at low surgical risk.

### Characteristics of bicuspid aortic valve disease and stenosis: The National Echo Database of Australia [^115xxVpf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Despite a significant proportion of patients having normal AV function, a wide spectrum of valve dysfunction was observed, with 57.8% and 54.1% of patients manifesting some degree of AS or aortic regurgitation, respectively. Although the proportion of patients with any aortic regurgitation was similar to that found at the time of diagnosis in a small community cohort from Olmsted County (247/416, 59%), the proportion with AS in our patients with BAV was significantly higher than previously reported. Michelena et al found only 23% of their community-based cohort to have any AS at the time of diagnosis, although this difference is almost certainly because of the much younger average age at diagnosis in that study, which was approximately 15 years younger than in our cohort.

In this study, we found that the average aortic dimensions at the time of BAV diagnosis fell within the normal range. A significant proportion of this relatively young cohort of patients, however, had clinically significant ascending aortic dilatation, with 12.8% of patients having an ascending aortic diameter greater than 45 mm. We note and are concerned by the relatively low proportion of patients with BAV aortic diameter measurements in this database, with only approximately one-third having their proximal ascending aortic dimension recorded, despite a specific identification of a BAV. It is well recognized that BAV disease may be associated with serious sequelae involving not only the AV but the ascending aorta as well; thus, the lack of specified ascending aortic dimensions is surprising.

### Implications of monogenic bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) forms among sporadic BAV patients [^114wEVnJ]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2025). Low credibility.

Non-syndromic bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital heart defect, with an estimated prevalence of 0.5–2% in the population. BAV is of major clinical relevance due to its high lifetime risk of complications such as aortic valve stenosis (AS), aortic valve insufficiency (AI), or thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA). The majority of non-syndromic BAV cases have a multifactorial aetiology, where common genetic variants confer disease risk in a cumulative fashion. Only a small proportion of non-syndromic BAV cases have a monogenic aetiology, where penetrant rare variants (RVs) in single genes are disease-causing. However, due to incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity, it can be difficult to identify monogenic BAV cases.

In the present study, we aimed to assess the proportion of monogenic forms among sporadic BAV patients. As patients, we included 740 non-syndromic BAV cases (N = 191 females, N = 549 males) that were recruited at cardiovascular centers of three university hospitals in Western Germany (Bonn, Cologne, Duesseldorf) between 2016 and 2020. All patients were of European descent and were referred to the hospitals due to BAV complications (N = 399 with AS, N = 536 with AI, N = 270 with TAA; overlapping phenotypes possible). In all patients, BAV diagnosis was confirmed using transthoracic/transesophageal echocardiography or computed tomography. There was no evidence for syndromic BAV in all patients; clinical symptoms characteristic of conditions such as Turner syndrome were excluded.

### Association between bicuspid aortic valve phenotype and patterns of valvular dysfunction: A meta-analysis [^114ScgnN]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

A systematic search was performed in the electronic databases including PubMed, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and CNKI. The search used the following terms in all possible combinations: bicuspid aortic valve, aortic regurgitation, aortic stenosis, and valve dysfunction.

Articles were rejected on initial screening if the title or abstract indicated that the article did not report on aortic valve dysfunction and BAV morphology. Subsequently, the full text of the remaining articles was retrieved and all references were scanned. Studies were examined to exclude duplicates and overlapping data. Only studies evaluating aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation were included. In cases of missing data, the authors were contacted via email to attempt retrieval of the original data. Each article was analyzed by two independent individuals, and data extraction was conducted independently. In case of disagreement, a third investigator was consulted, and discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Data extraction followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

- **Figure 1: Flow diagram for study selection**: This flow chart shows the initial search results and the final review of 11 studies after consideration of exclusions.

Inclusion criteria were as follows:

1. Domestic and foreign published literature, all studies where participants were diagnosed with BAV by TTE, TEE, or CT.
2. Information about the morphology of BAV (RL morphology).
