## Question

How to know when no longer contagious

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to determine when someone with COVID-19 is no longer contagious. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "contagious" means biologically versus what tests actually detect. Then, I should verify the standard symptom-based criteria for mild to moderate cases. Next, I will examine the exceptions for severe disease, critical illness, and immunocompromised hosts. After that, I should review why NAAT/PCR and antigen tests can mislead and how to interpret them if used. Finally, I will consider special populations, test-based strategies if required, and the bottom-line, practical recommendations aligned with IDSA and WHO guidance.

> Let me first confirm the biological target we're trying to assess, because I need to ensure we are not conflating detection of viral RNA with infectiousness. Contagiousness reflects the presence of replication-competent virus that can transmit to others, whereas RT-PCR and other NAATs detect viral RNA that may persist for weeks to months after active infection and does not distinguish viable from nonviable virus, meaning a positive PCR does not equal infectiousness by itself [^1135YQ17] [^115URrqH]. Wait, let me verify the time course: multiple studies and reviews show that the ability to culture live virus drops to near-zero by about 10 days after symptom onset in mild to moderate cases, even though PCR may remain positive much longer, reinforcing that symptom-based strategies are appropriate for most patients [^115URrqH] [^116qHwiY].

> I will now examine the standard criteria for mild to moderate cases. The commonly recommended approach is a symptom-based strategy ending isolation when at least 10 days have passed since symptom onset, at least 24 hours have elapsed with no fever without antipyretics, and respiratory symptoms have improved; no negative test is required, and I should double-check that this aligns with both SHEA summaries and IDSA positions, which it does [^116qHwiY] [^1135YQ17]. Hold on, I should verify the biological rationale: because replication-competent virus is rarely isolated beyond day 10 in nonsevere cases, the risk of onward transmission is low after this threshold if symptoms are resolving, supporting this approach [^115URrqH] [^114iSKxL].

> But wait, what if the illness was severe, critical, or the patient is immunocompromised. I need to ensure I extend the isolation window appropriately in those exceptions. For severe to critical disease or immunocompromised hosts, the window of infectiousness can extend to about 15–20 days from symptom onset; some expert reviews cite a maximum of 20 days in these groups, so extending isolation to at least 15 days, and considering up to 20 days in selected immunocompromised patients, is reasonable if symptoms are improving and fever has resolved [^115URrqH] [^112rYJ4U]. Let me reconsider test-based strategies: if used, a high PCR cycle threshold and serial antigen patterns may support clearance, but there is no definitive NAAT-based proof of noninfectiousness, so any test-based approach should be interpreted cautiously and in clinical context [^1135YQ17].

> Next, I should review why relying on PCR to end isolation is problematic, and I need to check the evidence base here. Multiple guidelines caution that requiring two negative PCRs can unnecessarily prolong isolation because PCR detects noninfectious RNA for weeks; large contact-tracing data from Korea showed no transmission from "re-positive" patients, and IDSA explicitly notes the harms and lack of benefit of NAAT-based strategies for routine discontinuation of isolation [^116qHwiY] [^1135YQ17]. Hold on, I should verify whether this applies across settings: while hospitals with zero-tolerance risk may adopt stricter policies, the biological signal that infectivity wanes by day 10 in mild cases remains strong, which is why symptom-based strategies are preferred for most [^116qHwiY].

> Let me consider antigen testing, since some programs use rapid tests to guide isolation. Antigen positivity correlates imperfectly with culturable virus; false negatives occur and culture-negative antigen results do not guarantee absence of contagiousness, so consecutive negative antigen results can support, but do not prove, noninfectiousness and should be interpreted with caution, especially early in infection when antigen sensitivity is limited [^11542wEL]. I should double-check whether modeling or policy work supports using antigen thresholds to end isolation; a computational framework suggests that lower antigen detection limits and multiple negative results may better approximate noninfectiousness, but this remains an inference rather than a validated clinical rule, so symptom-based criteria still anchor best practice [^113hEAuo].

> I will now examine asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmission because it shapes when we start counting the contagious window. Infectiousness often peaks around or just before symptom onset, and a substantial fraction of transmission occurs from people without symptoms, which underscores why symptom-based ending criteria rely on the illness timeline rather than first positive test date in community guidance, even though policies vary by jurisdiction and risk tolerance [^114MTwsZ] [^112VdwSK]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said we should count from the test date for asymptomatic cases; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — while some policies allow test date anchoring with added caution, the safer and more consistent approach is to use symptom onset when available, and in truly asymptomatic cases many programs apply a conservative interval from the first positive test, recognizing the absence of a symptom anchor [^notfound].

> Next, I should review special populations and edge cases. Immunocompromised patients may shed replication-competent virus beyond 20 days in rare cases, so individualized decisions using clinical trajectory, PCR cycle thresholds if available, and, when feasible, consultation with infectious diseases specialists are prudent. Case series of patients receiving immunomodulators like tocilizumab and dexamethasone illustrate prolonged culture positivity in some, reinforcing the need for extended precautions in select hosts [^114P1YXM] [^1137vxzq]. Let me verify pediatric and other viral contexts briefly: children with RSV may shed longer, but that is RSV-specific and should not be extrapolated to COVID-19 timelines without evidence, so I should avoid overgeneralization here [^114u4pDX].

> I should confirm the role of vaccination and variants, because I need to ensure my advice reflects current transmission dynamics. Vaccination reduces severity and likely modestly reduces infectiousness, but breakthrough infections still occur and vaccinated individuals can transmit, particularly early in infection; thus, vaccination status does not change the symptom-based isolation endpoint for most patients, though it may influence pretest probability and testing strategies in exposed persons [^111hPjUx]. Hold on, I should verify whether Omicron changed the infectious window substantially; while immune escape increased transmission, the time course of peak infectiousness and decline remains broadly similar, supporting the same symptom-based endpoints for ending isolation in nonsevere cases [^112PzKBt].

> Let me synthesize practical guidance and double-check alignment with major bodies. For most people with mild to moderate COVID-19, end isolation after at least 10 days from symptom onset, at least 24 hours afebrile without antipyretics, and with improvement in respiratory symptoms; no negative test is required, and extending beyond 10 days solely due to a persistent PCR is not recommended [^116qHwiY]. For severe to critical illness or immunocompromised hosts, extend to at least 15 days, consider up to 20 days if clinically indicated, and use clinical judgment; if a test-based strategy is mandated locally, interpret high Ct values and serial antigen results cautiously and in context, recognizing their limitations [^115URrqH] [^1137vxzq]. I need to ensure I emphasize layered precautions on return: masking, hand hygiene, and distancing for an additional period, especially in healthcare or congregate settings, to mitigate residual risk and staff anxiety [^notfound].

> Finally, I should double-check the bottom line and make sure I'm not missing a nuance. The key principle is that contagiousness tracks viable virus, not PCR positivity; in mild to moderate cases, that risk becomes negligible by about day 10 after symptom onset as symptoms resolve, whereas in severe or immunocompromised disease, a longer, individualized approach is warranted; testing can assist but should not override clinical and epidemiologic reasoning, and symptom-based strategies remain the evidence-aligned default for most patients [^115URrqH] [^1135YQ17] [^116qHwiY].

You are no longer contagious when **symptoms have resolved** and **at least 10 days have passed** since symptom onset, with at least 24 hours fever-free without antipyretics and improving respiratory symptoms [^115URrqH] [^116qHwiY]. For severe or immunocompromised cases, extend isolation to **15–20 days** or until two negative PCRs 24 hours apart [^114iSKxL] [^115URrqH]. PCR can remain positive for weeks after infectivity ends, so **use symptom-based criteria** rather than PCR to guide return [^1135YQ17] [^112XwCpo]. If symptoms persist or immune status is uncertain, consult a clinician before ending isolation [^1137vxzq].

## General guidelines for determining contagiousness

Contagiousness varies by illness severity, immune status, and testing results; **symptom-based criteria** are the most reliable for ending isolation [^116qHwiY].

---

### Mild to moderate cases (non-severe illness)

- **Duration of isolation**: At least 10 days after symptom onset.
- **Symptom resolution**: Fever-free for ≥ 24 hours without antipyretics, and respiratory symptoms improving.
- **Testing**: PCR can remain positive for weeks after infectivity ends; symptom-based criteria are preferred [^1135YQ17] [^116qHwiY].

---

### Severe or critical cases (including immunocompromised patients)

- **Duration of isolation**: Extend to 15–20 days after symptom onset.
- **Testing**: Consider two negative PCR tests 24 hours apart before ending isolation.
- **Clinical judgment**: Use clinical assessment due to prolonged viral shedding in severe or immunocompromised cases [^114iSKxL] [^115URrqH].

---

## Role of testing in determining contagiousness

Testing helps assess contagiousness, but **no test perfectly distinguishes infectious from non-infectious virus** [^11542wEL].

---

### PCR testing

PCR detects viral RNA, including non-infectious fragments, and may remain positive for weeks after infectivity ends; therefore, **PCR positivity alone does not indicate contagiousness** [^1135YQ17] [^112XwCpo]. Infectious virus is rarely cultured beyond 10 days after symptom onset in mild cases, supporting symptom-based criteria [^115URrqH] [^114iSKxL].

---

### Antigen testing

Antigen tests detect active infection and correlate better with infectivity than PCR, but **false negatives occur**, especially early or late in infection [^11542wEL]. Negative antigen results can support non-contagiousness when combined with symptom resolution, but are not definitive [^113hEAuo].

---

## Special considerations

---

### Immunocompromised individuals

Immunocompromised patients may shed infectious virus longer; **extend isolation to 15–20 days** or until two negative PCRs 24 hours apart [^114iSKxL] [^115URrqH].

---

### Persistent symptoms or long COVID

Persistent symptoms do not necessarily indicate ongoing contagiousness; **use symptom-based criteria** and clinical judgment to guide isolation [^115URrqH].

---

## Criteria for ending isolation

| **Illness severity** | **Duration of isolation** | **Symptom criteria** | **Testing criteria** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Mild to moderate | ≥ 10 days after symptom onset | - Fever-free ≥ 24 hours without antipyretics <br/> - Improving respiratory symptoms | Not required |
| Severe or immunocompromised | 15–20 days after symptom onset | - Fever-free ≥ 24 hours without antipyretics <br/> - Improving respiratory symptoms | Two negative PCRs 24 hours apart (optional) |

---

## Conclusion

You are no longer contagious when **symptoms have resolved** and at least 10 days have passed since symptom onset, with at least 24 hours fever-free without antipyretics and improving respiratory symptoms. For severe or immunocompromised cases, extend isolation to 15–20 days or until two negative PCRs 24 hours apart. PCR can remain positive after infectivity ends, so **use symptom-based criteria** rather than PCR to guide return [^115URrqH] [^1135YQ17].

### Emerging viral infections [^115Z8Gn7]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

The past decade has witnessed the emergence of several significant viral pathogens and the further evolution of additional viral pathogens. Transmitted by a variety of differing routes, these organisms have presented substantial intellectual challenges to medicine of the 20th and 21st centuries. As perhaps the benchmark pathogen of the past decade, HIV has provided medicine and society with a most formidable opponent, and one that has yet to be fully conquered. Nonetheless, a variety of additional viral pathogens have also perplexed medicine over the past 10–15 years.

### The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections that are asymptomatic: a systematic review [^112TWgBh]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Asymptomatic infection seems to be a notable feature of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the pathogen that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but the prevalence is uncertain.

Purpose

To estimate the proportion of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 who never develop symptoms.

Data Sources

Searches of Google News, Google Scholar, medRxiv, and PubMed using the keywords antibodies, asymptomatic, coronavirus, COVID-19, PCR, seroprevalence, and SARS-CoV-2.

Study Selection

Observational, descriptive studies and reports of mass screening for SARS-CoV-2 that were either cross-sectional or longitudinal in design; were published through 17 November 2020; and involved SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid or antibody testing of a target population, regardless of current symptomatic status, over a defined period.

Data Extraction

The authors collaboratively extracted data on the study design, type of testing performed, number of participants, criteria for determining symptomatic status, testing results, and setting.

Data Synthesis

Sixty-one eligible studies and reports were identified, of which 43 used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of nasopharyngeal swabs to detect current SARS-CoV-2 infection and 18 used antibody testing to detect current or prior infection. In the 14 studies with longitudinal data that reported information on the evolution of symptomatic status, nearly three quarters of persons who tested positive but had no symptoms at the time of testing remained asymptomatic. The highest-quality evidence comes from nationwide, representative serosurveys of England (n = 365104) and Spain (n = 61075), which suggest that at least one third of SARS-CoV-2 infections are asymptomatic.

Limitation

For PCR-based studies, data are limited to distinguish presymptomatic from asymptomatic infection. Heterogeneity precluded formal quantitative syntheses.

Conclusion

Available data suggest that at least one third of SARS-CoV-2 infections are asymptomatic. Longitudinal studies suggest that nearly three quarters of persons who receive a positive PCR test result but have no symptoms at the time of testing will remain asymptomatic. Control strategies for COVID-19 should be altered, taking into account the prevalence and transmission risk of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.

### Asymptomatic transmission during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and implications for public health strategies [^116bL7Lf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread rapidly in a few months despite global public health strategies to curb transmission by testing symptomatic patients and social distancing. This review summarizes evidence that highlights transmission by asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals. Viral load of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases is comparable. Viral shedding is highest before symptom onset, suggesting high transmissibility before symptoms. Within universally tested subgroups, high percentages of SARS-CoV-2 infected asymptomatic individuals were found. Asymptomatic transmission was reported in several clusters, including a Wuhan study showing an alarming rate of intrahospital transmission. Several countries reported higher prevalence among healthcare workers than general population raising concern that healthcare workers could act as silent vectors. Therefore, current strategies that rely solely on "symptom onset" for infection identification need urgent reassessment. Extensive universal testing irrespective of symptoms may be considered, with priority placed on groups with high frequency exposure to positive patients.

### Valacyclovir hydrochloride (valacyclovir) [^111cbXhs]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted disease. It causes small, painful blisters on your genital area. You can spread genital herpes to others, even when you have no symptoms. If you are sexually active, you can still pass herpes to your partner, even if you are taking valacyclovir tablets. Valacyclovir tablets, taken every day as prescribed and used with the following safer sex practices, can lower the chances of passing genital herpes to your partner.

Do not have sexual contact with your partner when you have any symptom or outbreak of genital herpes.
Use a condom made of latex or polyurethane whenever you have sexual contact.

Ask your healthcare provider for more information about safer sex practices.

Who should not take valacyclovir tablets? Do not take valacyclovir tablets if you are allergic to any of their ingredients or to acyclovir. The active ingredient is valacyclovir. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in valacyclovir tablets. Before taking valacyclovir tablets, tell your healthcare provider:

About all your medical conditions, including:

if you have had a bone marrow transplant or kidney transplant, or if you have advanced HIV disease or "AIDS". Patients with these conditions may have a higher chance for getting a blood disorder called thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS). TTP/HUS can result in death.
if you have kidney problems. Patients with kidney problems may have a higher chance for getting side effects or more kidney problems with valacyclovir tablets. Your healthcare provider may give you a lower dose of valacyclovir tablets.
if you are 65 years of age or older. Elderly patients have a higher chance of certain side effects. Also, elderly patients are more likely to have kidney problems. Your healthcare provider may give you a lower dose of valacyclovir tablets.
if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. Talk with your healthcare provider about the risks and benefits of taking prescription drugs (including valacyclovir tablets) during pregnancy.
if you are breastfeeding. Valacyclovir hydrochloride may pass into your milk and it may harm your baby. Talk with your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby if you are taking valacyclovir tablets.
about all the medicines you take, including prescription and non-prescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Valacyclovir tablets may affect other medicines, and other medicines may affect valacyclovir tablets. It is a good idea to keep a complete list of all the medicines you take. Show this list to your healthcare provider and pharmacist any time you get a new medicine.

### Diagnostic performance of a combined rapid antigen test for detecting SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus in symptomatic patients in tertiary care [^115VmfRS]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, patient characteristics also influence RDT performance. Our study included only symptomatic individuals, aligning with the intended clinical use of RDTs in emergency and outpatient triage settings. Since sensitivity is significantly lower in asymptomatic or presymptomatic individuals, our findings may not be fully generalizable to broader screening contexts. Immune status also significantly influences test performance, with reported sensitivities as low as 32% among vaccinated individuals. Patient age is another important factor affecting test reliability, with RSV sensitivity shown to decrease from 52.3% in infants to 33.3% in children > 5 years. In our study, 80% of RSV–positive samples were from children < 5 years, likely contributing to the observed sensitivity of the RDT.

Finally, the timing of diagnostic testing is also critical. At our tertiary care center, symptomatic patients presented with a wide range of viral loads. RDT performance is typically highest in the first days after symptom onset, when viral RNA levels peak, with reported sensitivity ranges from 35.7% to 71.4%, increasing to 90.6% by day four. Although viral detection beyond 10 days after symptom onset is generally not considered to represent infectious virions, some samples with Ct‐values up to 35 yielded culturable virus. This indicates that patients with lower viral loads, and corresponding negative RDT results, may still be infectious, especially in the early stages of infection. In contrast, NATs may remain positive for weeks after infection, detecting residual RNA even when infectious virus is no longer present. Notably, immunocompromised individuals and transplant recipients, may continue to shed infectious virus at low viral loads for extended periods. These findings underscore that while high viral loads typically correlate with the presence of culturable virus, neither NAT nor antigen‐based RDTs can reliably distinguish between infectious virus and noninfectious viral remnants. Only virus isolation in cell culture can confirm infectivity, which is not feasible in routine diagnostics. Thus, the relationship between viral load and contagiousness is complex and modulated by host‐ and virus‐specific factors such as immune status, timing of sample collection, and viral replication kinetics. Consequently, both NAT and RDT results must be interpreted with caution and in clinical context, when guiding infection control measures and patient management.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on infection prevention for health care personnel caring for patients with suspected or known COVID-19 [^116bNTVp]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 infection prevention — evidence review methods indicate that evidence from experimental or laboratory studies were included as sources of indirect evidence and public health websites, such as the CDC and WHO, were also reviewed for additional literature; pairs of reviewers extracted relevant information into a standardized data extraction form, existing systematic reviews also were reviewed for methodologic rigor, and when appropriate, specific subgroup analyses were conducted using Review Manager. Reviewers assessed risk of bias with the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for RCTs and the Risk of Bias Instrument for Non-randomized Studies – of Interventions (ROBINS-I). The certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach; evidence from RCTs start as high-certainty evidence and observational studies start out as low-certainty of evidence. Factors that may reduce one's certainty include risk of bias (study limitations), inconsistency (unexplained heterogeneity across study findings), indirectness (applicability or generalizability to the research question), imprecision (the confidence in the estimate of an effect to support a particular decision), or publication bias (selective publication of studies), whereas certainty may be strengthened by large or very large magnitude of effect, evidence of a dose-response gradient, or opposing residual confounding. The certainty of evidence is categorized into four levels ranging from very low to high, and for each recommendation an overall judgment of certainty of evidence is made based on critical outcomes; evidence profiles were used to display summary estimates and judgments, and GRADE evidence profiles and summary of findings tables were developed in GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool.

### Summary of WHO infection prevention and control guideline for COVID-19: striving for evidence based practice in infection prevention and control [^115p1az9]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Research gaps

The guideline development process identified important gaps in the evidence including cost and resource considerations, effects of IPC interventions on equity and other social and cultural factors, and the need for high quality studies (including well conducted randomised controlled trials) evaluating the effectiveness of IPC interventions for reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

IPC measures are often implemented as a package — for example, health and care workers wear PPE while maintaining a physical distance in a HCF with proper ventilation. This bundled approach poses difficulties when designing studies owing to the inappropriateness of decoupling these well established bundles to evaluate the effectiveness of individual measures. To help tackle these challenges, IPC research protocols, which include a multifactorial approach (eg, multi-arm and adaptative trial designs), should be pre-prepared as this would facilitate the timely implementation of studies at the onset of an outbreak of a novel or re-emerging pathogen. Such readiness will help facilitate quick data collection methods and rapidly produce findings to inform best IPC practice. Furthermore, differences in the common understanding of microbial transmission terminology and dynamics complicated evidence synthesis and recommendation development. In response, WHO has recently published a report entitled "global technical report on proposed terminology for pathogens that transmits through the air". However, further research is needed to understand the implications of this new terminology for preventive measures in clinical care settings.

### SHEA practice update: infection prevention and control (IPC) in residential facilities for pediatric patients and their families [^111wKGhq]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

Restrict individuals from the family-centered residential facility who are suspected or confirmed to have measles. Allow entry into the facility when they are no longer contagious, usually 4 days after the appearance of the rash. Prior to entry, require written medical clearance from a licensed clinician or local public health department that states that they are no longer contagious.
Restrict all individuals who have been exposed to a person with suspected or confirmed measles until they obtain written medical clearance from a licensed clinician or public health department that states that they are not a risk for transmitting the infection.
Refer individuals who develop symptoms of measles, and their family members, to leave the facility immediately and receive prompt medical evaluation. Notify the medical facility in advance that individuals are being referred for measles evaluation so that appropriate isolation precautions can be initiated and exposures to others are prevented.
Contact the referring medical facility and local public health department for further instruction and assistance with testing to confirm the measles diagnosis.
If medical evaluation confirms the individual has measles, notify the person's primary care physician or licensed clinician and the program manager immediately, who will: Identify and notify exposed guests and instruct them to immediately consult a licensed clinician or the public health department for possible post-exposure prophylaxis. Non-immune individuals who have a normal immune system and are not pregnant should receive measles vaccine up to 72 hours after exposure. High-risk individuals who have a compromised immune system may receive immune globulin up to 6 days after exposure to measles.

SHEA practice update — varicella and shingles precautions in pediatric residential facilities — educate guests and visitors of the importance of frequent hand hygiene and appropriate disposal of potentially contaminated items. People who are not immune to varicella can get chickenpox if directly exposed to shingles blisters; interview individuals recently exposed about the level of exposure and, if the person's exposure was significant, require written medical clearance prior to entry, with documentation that the exposed individual is not contagious by meeting 1 of 4 criteria: the person has a past history of having had chickenpox or shingles (diagnosed by a licensed clinician), the person has documentation of 2 doses of varicella-containing vaccine, separated by at least 3 months, the person has documented varicella antibodies (varicella zoster IgG), or it has been at least 21 days since the person's last contact with the blisters (if post-exposure prophylaxis with intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) or varicella zoster immune globulin was received, it must be 28 days since last exposure). Request that individuals suspected of having shingles leave the facility and stay isolated from children until they are healed and no longer contagious; if medical evaluation rules out chickenpox and diagnoses the person with shingles without pustular lesions or scabs, then the person can remain in the facility.

### Viral infections in critical care: a narrative review [^1174ZiGC]. Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Viral infections form a substantial part of the intensive care workload, even before the recent and ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The growing availability of molecular diagnostics for viral infections has led to increased recognition of these pathogens. This additional information, however, provides new challenges for interpretation and management. As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has amply demonstrated, the emergence and global spread of novel viruses are likely to provide continued challenges for critical care physicians into the future. This article will provide an overview of viral infections relevant to the critical care physician, discussing the diagnosis and management of respiratory viral infections, blood borne and enteric viruses. We will also discuss herpesviridae complications, commonly seen due to reactivation of latent infections. Further, we explore some rarer and emerging viruses, including recognition of viral haemorrhagic fevers, and briefly discuss post-viral syndromes which may present to the intensive care unit. Finally, we will discuss infection control and its importance in preventing nosocomial viral transmission.

### What will we choose to learn from the COVID-19 pandemic? [^116Zq99A]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

One would be rightfully shocked to recall that just 2 years ago, at the beginning of the pandemic, calls for solidarity both within and across communities and nations were the norm; many pieces were written, and speeches delivered, to celebrate and encourage acts of collective responsibility and solidarity. From the creation of the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) initiativeto the sharing of prevention strategies like wearing a mask and staying home so grandma is not put at unnecessary risk, we were all called on to make sure that we collectively had a fighting chance against this 'novel' threat.

With 86% of the world currently not fully vaccinated, the majority of whom are in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) with little to no vaccine access, this premature call for a 'return to normal', along with all the implications that it carries for those among us who have lost, and continue to lose, the most in this fight, is not only short-sighted but also insidiously violent. To 'return to normal' would mean that we have not learnt anything from this experience. We need to ask ourselves why we should want to return to a state in which we are once again vulnerable to this level of destruction and disruption from a viral threat — especially while we have had plenty of chances to learn from our mistakes. This question is exceedingly more important now as more contagious and deadlier variants leave those unvaccinated more vulnerable. Our current response would suggest that the lesson we are choosing to take away from this is that we can get away with putting the most vulnerable in our communities on the front lines of these fights and see nothing wrong with expecting the same 'sacrifice' from them the next time around; all while refusing to provide them with the bare minimum protection and support to meet their basic needs.

Instead of this urge to return to a prepandemic normal, we should start proactively setting up systems that allow us to take better care of ourselves and each other in times of collective threat and, maybe more importantly, in times of 'normalcy'. To achieve this, we need to make sure that the lessons we learn are correct, reflect on what happened and continues to happen to the most vulnerable among us, and ensure that these lessons are turned into practice.

### Designing isolation guidelines for COVID-19 patients with rapid antigen tests [^113hEAuo]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Appropriate isolation guidelines for COVID-19 patients are warranted. Currently, isolating for fixed time is adopted in most countries. However, given the variability in viral dynamics between patients, some patients may no longer be infectious by the end of isolation, whereas others may still be infectious. Utilizing viral test results to determine isolation length would minimize both the risk of prematurely ending isolation of infectious patients and the unnecessary individual burden of redundant isolation of noninfectious patients. In this study, we develop a data-driven computational framework to compute the population-level risk and the burden of different isolation guidelines with rapid antigen tests (i.e. lateral flow tests). Here, we show that when the detection limit is higher than the infectiousness threshold values, additional consecutive negative results are needed to ascertain infectiousness status. Further, rapid antigen tests should be designed to have lower detection limits than infectiousness threshold values to minimize the length of prolonged isolation.

### Evidence supporting transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 while presymptomatic or asymptomatic [^114A8FxA]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Science Questions to Inform Public Health Action

The existence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission while infected persons are presymptomatic and asymptomatic raises 3 key questions that need to be answered to inform public health action. First, the incidence of asymptomatic compared with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection needs to be determined. The extent of presymptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection may be clarified by studies using serial virologic data, serologic data, or a combination of both in observational cohorts or surveillance systems. If a substantial proportion of infections are asymptomatic, enhanced testing strategies may be needed to detect these persons. Second, given that a large proportion of infections probably result from transmission from asymptomatic or presymptomatic persons, the effectiveness of public health interventions aimed at reducing their infectiousness needs to be quantified. If the COVID-19 pandemic is found to be driven by undetected asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, new innovations in disease detection and prevention (beyond exhaustive contact tracing, mass testing, and isolation of asymptomatic contacts) may be needed. Last, knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 immunity among persons with asymptomatic or mild SARS-CoV-2 infection is needed; specifically, whether full or partial immunity develops in these persons, how long protective immunity lasts, and if it is possible to be immune from reinfection but still asymptomatically transmit SARS-CoV-2 while in a carrier state. This information will be crucial for projecting the anticipated course of the pandemic and the potential for SARS-CoV-2 resurgence if immunity wanes. Information about immunity is also valuable for healthcare and other critical infrastructure workers for whom rates of exposure, and thereby asymptomatic infection, may be higher and who therefore warrant data-informed guidance on how to safely return to work. The answers to these questions will be crucial for guiding the gradual relaxing of community interventions, resuming the normal functions of society, and recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic.

### The disease burden of respiratory syncytial virus in older adults [^114u4pDX]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), first identified by Robert Chanock in 1956, is a single stranded RNA virus. RSV is a common respiratory pathogen and almost all children are infected by the age of 3 years. RSV is a member of the Pneumoviridae family, characterized by enveloped viral particles. This envelope contains key surface glycoproteins such as the G protein, which allows the virus to attach to and enter host cells and stimulates neutralizing antibodies. The F protein, another crucial component, facilitates attachment and fusion to the host cell membrane. The F protein also undergoes a shift from a prefusion to a postfusion form and remains a central target for vaccine and passive prophylactic measures development. There are two subgroups – A and B. RSV is transmitted primarily through droplets released by coughing and sneezing and involves direct contact with infected persons and contact with contaminated surfaces. Some infants may remain contagious for longer and those with immunocompromised status may remain contagious up to 4 weeks. RSV exhibits distinct seasonality in most parts of the world and causes severe disease in the very young (infants < 1 year) and the older adults ≥ 60 years.

Mumps — background and residential facility restrictions — "Mumps is a viral infection characterized by the swelling of one or more salivary glands of the head and neck, usually the glands located on the face immediately in front of the ears". Transmission and contagious period are described as "Mumps spreads through contact with respiratory droplets or saliva. Individuals are most contagious several days before the appearance of swollen glands until 5 days after the onset of symptoms. Mumps can be prevented by vaccination". Facility guidance states: "Restrict individuals with mumps from the family-centered residential facility until at least 5 days from the appearance of swollen glands. Individuals must obtain written medical clearance from a licensed clinician before entering the facility". It further advises: "Restrict individuals who have been exposed to a person with mumps, even if they do not have symptoms of illness, from the facility until they obtain written medical clearance from a licensed clinician".

### Duration of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infectivity: when is It safe to discontinue isolation? [^115URrqH]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Defining the duration of infectivity of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has major implications for public health and infection control practice in healthcare facilities. Early in the pandemic, most hospitals required 2 negative RT-PCR tests before discontinuing isolation in patients with Covid-19. Many patients, however, have persistently positive RT-PCR tests for weeks to months following clinical recovery, and multiple studies now indicate that these generally do not reflect replication-competent virus. SARS-CoV-2 appears to be most contagious around the time of symptom onset, and infectivity rapidly decreases thereafter to near-zero after about 10 days in mild-moderately ill patients and 15 days in severely-critically ill and immunocompromised patients. The longest interval associated with replication-competent virus thus far is 20 days from symptom onset. This review summarizes evidence-to-date on the duration of infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, and how this has informed evolving public health recommendations on when it is safe to discontinue isolation precautions.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: molecular diagnostic testing (December 2023) [^112ZFpoq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing — pre-procedure screening of asymptomatic individuals is characterized by limited evidence and mixed benefits and harms. Across studies, 0–4% of healthcare providers who cared for the patients were reported to have positive SARS-CoV-2 test results sometime after the procedure, and the panel agreed that the overall certainty of the evidence supporting this recommendation was very low. The possible benefit of screening asymptomatic individuals include reducing exposure of healthcare providers and other patients to SARS-CoV-2, thereby reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, whereas potential harms include unnecessary delays in procedures and false confidence if a patient tested pre-procedure is in the incubation period and becomes infectious during the procedure. Institutions that require pre-procedure screening generally request testing within 72 hours of the scheduled procedure; a shorter window may better reflect risk but may be unrealistic for many institutions, particularly when testing is performed in an off-site laboratory. Wider use of point-of-care NAAT may be difficult due to testing logistics, supply chain concerns, and limited tests with an indication for use in asymptomatic individuals. In cases of positive results, deferring when other mitigation measures are in place, including vaccination of healthcare providers and use of appropriate PPE, may cause undue harm to the patient and have minimal or no effect on risk of transmission; this may be especially true for patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and are no longer infectious but who continue to shed non-viable SARS-CoV-2 detected by highly sensitive NAATs. The panel emphasized challenges of re-scheduling and increased risk from delaying procedures, and noted that linking a SARS-CoV-2 acquisition to an asymptomatic individual is difficult when community transmission levels are high.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on infection prevention for health care personnel caring for patients with suspected or known COVID-19 [^115CiF93]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

IDSA infection prevention for health care personnel caring for patients with suspected or known COVID-19 highlights that the short-range continuum of small respiratory particles, ranging from aerosols to droplets, are likely the major contributors of transmission, and states that the primary mechanism to reduce aerosol transmission is ventilation; higher levels of air exchanges and filtration are commonly required in U.S. healthcare settings, especially hospitals. It notes that although viral shedding decreases soon after symptom onset, many patients shed non-infectious viral RNA for prolonged periods, and that decay in viral load following symptom onset likely means that by the time patients are hospitalized with moderate, severe, or critical illness, the risks of transmission are reduced. The text explains that the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, most notably the delta variant, and higher levels of transmission, create additional complexity, and that studies to determine a biological basis of transmission risk within healthcare settings continue to be needed to inform appropriate PPE recommendations; the role of PPE in prevention of transmission to patients also needs to be addressed. Finally, it emphasizes that any guidance on PPE would be remiss not to mention the critical role of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination for HCP, stating that universal and required vaccination of HCP provides the most important level of protection and, when combined with appropriate PPE and other interventions, creates the safest possible environment for HCP providing care for patients with COVID-19.

What is an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)?

The United States FDA has made GOHIBIC available under an emergency access mechanism called an EUA. The EUA is supported by a Secretary of Health and Human Service (HHS) declaration that circumstances exist to justify the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic.

GOHIBIC, as a treatment for COVID-19 has not undergone the same type of review as an FDA-approved product for this indication. The FDA may issue an EUA when certain criteria are met, which includes that there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. In addition, the FDA decision is based on the totality of scientific evidence available showing that it is reasonable to believe that the product meets certain criteria for safety, performance, and labeling and may be effective in treatment of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

All of these criteria must be met to allow for the product to be used in the treatment of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The EUA for GOHIBIC as a treatment for certain people with COVID-19 is in effect for the duration of the COVID-19 declaration justifying emergency use of this product, unless terminated or revoked (after which the products may no longer be used under the EUA).

### Coronavirus disease 2019 and airborne transmission: science rejected, lives lost. can society Do better? [^117C34zb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

CAN SOCIETY DO BETTER?

What course would the pandemic have taken if airborne transmission had been recognized at the beginning of April 2020 and guidelines on the mitigation of airborne transmission had been provided? How many cases would have been prevented, how many long-COVID cases and how many lives would have been saved? Of course, we will never know for sure as there is no reliable counterfactual; yet, it is clear that there was a delay in messaging to manage airborne exposures and that funding was prioritized for other measures. And why, after 3 years, is acceptance of the science of airborne infection transmission still a challenge? Several historical reasons are discussed by Jimenez et al, but historical errors should not shape the future.

One may say that the delay was only 3 months; perhaps that is only a short interval considering that we are now in the third year of the pandemic. However, those early 3 months were critical, because this was when control measures were being developed and introduced in countries around the world. This was also the time when public interest was most acute and messages around transmission were embedded into the actions that millions of people took in their daily lives. The "hygiene theatre" (as it was later called) was established, and for at least the next 12 months, hands were disinfected countless times during the day; surfaces in public spaces were deep cleaned; groceries from supermarkets were disinfected; and gloves were worn to avoid surface virus. But the virus was principally in the air, with even now limited evidence that fomites or hard surfaces play a significant role in transmission. The initial misguidance and subsequent mixed messages have delayed practical implications from being implemented as vigorously as they should have been, from recognizing the importance of airborne transmission to implementing controls demonstrated to be effective. Two and a half years later, in November 2022, the then WHO Chief Scientist admitted, "We should have done it much earlier [calling SARS-CoV-2 airborne], based on the available evidence, and it is something that has cost the organization".

### It's not you versus us, it's us versus the virus [^114MxrrJ]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2021). Medium credibility.

One of the first outbreaks among HCWs in Japan occurred among a group of resident physicians who held a social gathering. As infections have continue to spread throughout the community, some hospitals have reported instances of nosocomial transmission between HCWs, especially at facilities that admitted patients with COVID-19 in the early stages of the pandemic. These facts were taken up by the media in the manner described above, undermining the reputation of HCWs in general who daily put their own health at risk to provide care to patients with COVID-19.

In the wake of such episodes, hospital administrations have been obliged to issue press releases or hold press conferences whenever any of their healthcare staff tested positive or cases of nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV2 were confirmed within their facility. Such announcements have typically included an apology on behalf of the sick HCWs and for possible in-facility transmission of the virus. As a consequence of the negative press, some hospitals have resorted to removing exposed HCWs from the frontline until they are cleared of COVID-19, hampering efforts to treat patients and control the spread of infections. Furthermore, these hospitals have sometimes reacted to public scrutiny by restricting or intermittently terminating the admission of newly infected patients to contain the nosocomial spread of COVID-19 despite the urgent need to treat more, rather than fewer, patients as the pandemic continues to spread unabated.

### Development and dissemination of infectious disease dynamic transmission models during the COVID-19 pandemic: what can we learn from other pathogens and how can we move forward? [^114oV5vJ]. The Lancet: Digital Health (2021). High credibility.

The current COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the unprecedented development and integration of infectious disease dynamic transmission models into policy making and public health practice. Models offer a systematic way to investigate transmission dynamics and produce short-term and long-term predictions that explicitly integrate assumptions about biological, behavioural, and epidemiological processes that affect disease transmission, burden, and surveillance. Models have been valuable tools during the COVID-19 pandemic and other infectious disease outbreaks, able to generate possible trajectories of disease burden, evaluate the effectiveness of intervention strategies, and estimate key transmission variables. Particularly given the rapid pace of model development, evaluation, and integration with decision making in emergency situations, it is necessary to understand the benefits and pitfalls of transmission models. We review and highlight key aspects of the history of infectious disease dynamic models, the role of rigorous testing and evaluation, the integration with data, and the successful application of models to guide public health. Rather than being an expansive history of infectious disease models, this Review focuses on how the integration of modelling can continue to be advanced through policy and practice in appropriate and conscientious ways to support the current pandemic response.

### Infectious period… [^115P4YV8]. Wikipedia (2020). Medium credibility.

In epidemiology, particularly in the discussion of infectious disease dynamics, the infectious period is the time interval during which a host is infectious, i.e. capable of directly or indirectly transmitting pathogenic infectious agents or pathogens to another susceptible host. The infectious period can start before, during or after the onset of symptoms, and it may stop before or after the symptoms stop showing. It is also known in the literature by a variety of synonymous terms such as the infective period, the period of infectiousness, communicability period, the period of communicability, contagious period, the period of contagiousness, transmission period or transmissibility period. The degree of infectiousness is not constant but varies through the infectious period.

When pathogens encounter a susceptible individual and enter their body, it is called the exposure moment, and the individual turns into a host for those pathogens. After entering a host's body, pathogens usually require time to multiply or replicate at their favorite site in the body. After a certain time period, the pathogens become numerous enough so that the host is now able to transmit them into the environment. This marks the end of the latent period and simultaneously the beginning of the infectious period. As the disease becomes more severe, infectiousness increases. Meanwhile the host's body mounts immune responses to contain or eradicate the pathogens, and after a certain period of time, it may achieve that goal.

The quantity of pathogens in the host's body become sufficiently low so that the host is no longer capable of transmitting the disease. This usually marks the end of the infectious period, even though for some diseases such as Ebola, the virus continues to be present in the body fluids of the survivor. By contrast, if the host's body cannot recover from a potentially deadly infection, the host will die. Even after death, the infectious period might not be over. For example, the dead body of an individual who died of Ebola remains very infectious for up to a week. A related concept is the shedding period, which is the time interval during which a host or patient excretes the pathogenic organism through saliva, urine, feces or other bodily fluids. Shedding period usually coincides with the infectious period and used as its synonym. For viral infections, viral load and viral shedding are important related concepts.

Viral load refers to the quantity of virions in a given bodily fluid like blood, saliva, urine, etc. at different moments after infection. Viral shedding refers to the event when a host releases pathogens into their surroundings. Together these two factors influence how much and how long pathogens will be released among a population from an infected individual, two important metrics to measure the infectiousness of a disease. If the infectious period starts before the onset of the symptoms of the disease, then asymptomatic carriers can unwittingly spread the disease in the community. See also

IDSA COVID-19 antigen (Ag) testing — association with viral culture and contagion: The panel analyzed the relation between Ag positivity and replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 and noted that while culture-positive specimens were also likely to be Ag positive, culture negativity or Ag negativity does not mean that transmission of infection is not possible. Across studies using culture as a comparator, false-negative Ag results were observed (range, 3%–21% false-negative Ag tests vs culture). It is likely that some individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection who test negative by Ag and/or culture are contagious, and while the use of Ag testing to infer contagiousness and need for isolation is common, the panel identified no studies that provided direct empirical evidence in support of this practice.

### How did we get here? Short history of COVID-19 and other coronavirus-related epidemics [^111q2gn5]. Head & Neck (2020). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 epidemic was not the first coronavirus epidemic of this century and represents one of the increasing number of zoonoses from wildlife to impact global health. SARS CoV-2, the virus causing the COVID-19 epidemic is distinct from, but closely resembles SARS CoV-1, which was responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002. SARS CoV-1 and 2 share almost 80% of genetic sequences and use the same host cell receptor to initiate viral infection. However, SARS predominantly affected individuals in close contact with infected animals and health care workers. In contrast, CoV-2 exhibits robust person to person spread, most likely by means of asymptomatic carriers, which has resulted in greater spread of disease, overall morbidity and mortality, despite its lesser virulence. We review recent coronavirus-related epidemics and distinguish clinical and molecular features of CoV-2, the causative agent for COVID-19, and review the current status of vaccine trials.

### COVID-19 | Yellow book… [^112PzKBt]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Infectious agent Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019, is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that belongs to the family. Transmission SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted from person to person by airborne particles and droplets that carry infectious virus. When an infected person breathes, sings, talks, coughs, or sneezes, they release infectious aerosol particles into the air. Exposure can occur when aerosol particles and small respiratory droplets are inhaled or contact exposed mucous membranes. Indoors, fine droplets and aerosol particles can linger and accumulate, even after an infected person has left the room. The risk of infection generally increases with closer contact and with longer durations of contact with an infected person, particularly in poorly ventilated indoor or crowded settings.

Activities that increase emission of respiratory fluids, such as singing, cheering, or exercising, can increase risk of transmission. Infection from contaminated surfaces or objects is possible but generally does not contribute significantly to new infections. People with COVID-19 can be infectious from 1–2 days before and up to 8–10 days after symptoms begin. The majority of transmission appears to occur during the early periods of infection, particularly in the 1–2 days before symptoms start and within the first few days of symptom onset. This period of infectiousness may be reduced slightly but has been fairly consistent since SARS-CoV-2 emerged. Individuals who are asymptomatic can also transmit the virus. SARS-CoV-2 has had ongoing circulation, with waves of increased and decreased incidence since it emerged. The virus has continued to evolve and has not yet settled into a predictable pattern of circulation.

The dramatic shift in the virus from Delta to Omicron in late 2021 resulted in reduced vaccine effectiveness, more immune escape, and the loss of effectiveness of some therapeutics, along with a corresponding surge in infections. Broadly, SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe illness than when it first emerged, due to background immunity of the population and reduced severity of the virus itself. However, it remains a public health threat, particularly to individuals at increased risk of severe illness, and with ongoing circulation, travelers could be exposed whenever they are traveling. SARS-CoV-2 will continue to evolve, and a new variant could emerge that is more infectious or causes more severe illness. Severe disease occurs more often in people who are 50 years and older, with risk increasing substantially at ages > 65 years.

Risk of severe illness is also increased in people who are immunocompromised or with certain underlying medical conditions. Risk is greater with increasing number of comorbidities. Women who are pregnant are at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19, and of having a preterm birth, stillbirth, or other pregnancy complications if infected with SARS-CoV-2 while pregnant. More information: Long COVID and multisystem inflammatory syndrome Long COVID is broadly defined as an infection-associated chronic condition that occurs after SARS-CoV-2 infection and is present for at least 3 months as a continuous, relapsing and remitting, or progressive disease state that affects one or more organ systems. Long COVID, also referred to as post-COVID conditions or post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, can affect different body systems.

### Organizational strategies for managing COVID-19 survivors who return for care [^116qHwiY]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The goal of initial SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing is to identify patients who have active COVID-19 for clinical decision making and to identify patients who require transmission-based precautions to prevent the spread of infection. Once a patient has a positive RT-PCR result, 2 options exist for discontinuing transmission-based precautions: (1) test-based strategies, which generally require 2 negative tests at least 24 hours apart to end isolation and (2) symptom-based strategies, which discontinue isolation typically 10 days after symptom onset and resolution of fever for at least 24 hours without antipyretics and improvement in respiratory symptoms. We now have accumulated evidence that SARS-CoV-2 remains detectable by RT-PCR for an average of 3 weeks; however, we also have evidence demonstrating that, for uncomplicated, recovering COVID-19 patients, replication-competent virus cannot be cultured > 9–11 days after onset of illness. – The CDC's unpublished data indicate that the statistically estimated likelihood of recovering replication-competent virus approaches zero by 10 days, which is the basis for their symptom-based strategy for discontinuing isolation precautions. In May 2020, the Korean CDC published evidence that patients with COVID-19 who had late positive (ie, "re-positive") RT-PCR testing after interim negative tests did not transmit the infection to close household contacts. Of 285 monitored cases with 790 contacts, no case was found that was newly infected solely from contact with a "re-positive" case. They obtained respiratory samples from 108 of these patients and were unable to culture viable virus from any of them. For 23 patients, blood samples were also obtained, and all were positive for neutralizing antibodies. These data support the US CDC's symptom-based strategy by demonstrating that close contacts of patients with prolonged detection of SARS-CoV-2 by PCR did not become infected and, thus, that these patients were not contagious despite having repeated positive RT-PCR results.

### Transmission of SARS-CoV-2: a review of viral, host, and environmental factors [^112whnBY]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has spread globally in a few short months. Substantial evidence now supports preliminary conclusions about transmission that can inform rational, evidence-based policies and reduce misinformation on this critical topic. This article presents a comprehensive review of the evidence on transmission of this virus. Although several experimental studies have cultured live virus from aerosols and surfaces hours after inoculation, the real-world studies that detect viral RNA in the environment report very low levels, and few have isolated viable virus. Strong evidence from case and cluster reports indicates that respiratory transmission is dominant, with proximity and ventilation being key determinants of transmission risk. In the few cases where direct contact or fomite transmission is presumed, respiratory transmission has not been completely excluded. Infectiousness peaks around a day before symptom onset and declines within a week of symptom onset, and no late linked transmissions (after a patient has had symptoms for about a week) have been documented. The virus has heterogeneous transmission dynamics: Most persons do not transmit virus, whereas some cause many secondary cases in transmission clusters called "superspreading events". Evidence-based policies and practices should incorporate the accumulating knowledge about transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to help educate the public and slow the spread of this virus.

### Evidence supporting transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 while presymptomatic or asymptomatic [^111pAgz2]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Recent epidemiologic, virologic, and modeling reports support the possibility of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission from persons who are presymptomatic (SARS-CoV-2 detected before symptom onset) or asymptomatic (SARS-CoV-2 detected but symptoms never develop). SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the absence of symptoms reinforces the value of measures that prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by infected persons who may not exhibit illness despite being infectious. Critical knowledge gaps include the relative incidence of asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, the public health interventions that prevent asymptomatic transmission, and the question of whether asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection confers protective immunity.

### Organizational strategies for managing COVID-19 survivors who return for care [^114mbtS9]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2021). Medium credibility.

As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has evolved, survivors are now returning for care at hospitals and ambulatory sites, creating confusion and uncertainty for the frontline staff regarding proper management of these patients. Although the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides clear guidance on both symptom-based and test-based strategies for discontinuation of transmission-based precautions, many healthcare workers lack confidence that the symptom-based strategy of 10 days of isolation is long enough to assure that the patient is not infectious. Thus, some staff are uncomfortable managing a patient using standard precautions, especially if the patient has undergone repeat testing and remains positive for severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as indicated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. For hospitals that routinely test all admissions, should patients who have recovered from COVID-19 be included? And how should these patients be managed when it comes to preprocedure testing?

In the absence of definitive guidance or good-quality published evidence, healthcare epidemiologists must use the best available evidence to make practical and rational decisions. Making these decisions often requires acknowledgement and appropriate balance of 3 important goals: (1) keeping patients and employees safe from harm, which includes avoiding unnecessary delays in care for COVID survivors; (2) ensuring that resources, such as personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing reagents and materials, remain available for the highest-risk situations; and (3) ensuring that staff feel comfortable coming to work and caring for patients. To accomplish these goals, explicitly communicating what is known and not known about the epidemiology, biology, transmission, and mitigation strategies for COVID-19 often becomes necessary while acknowledging that new information will continue to emerge and that guidance may change as a result.

Regarding preventative measures for COVID-19 infection, more specifically with respect to isolation, WHO 2023 guidelines recommend to isolate patients with suspected or confirmed mild COVID-19 at a designated COVID-19 health facility, community facility, or at home (self-isolation) to prevent virus transmission according to the established COVID-19 care pathway.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^112rYJ4U]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

COVID-19 epidemiology — COVID-19 is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (type) 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which spreads through respiratory droplets and small particles, and the mean incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 3 to 5 days with nearly all infections occurring within 14 days of exposure. Viral shedding begins prior to the onset of symptoms, peaks around the time of symptom onset, and gradually declines over the next 7 to 10 days; transmission of infectious virus is unlikely after 10 days of illness, however prolonged shedding for 20 days or longer has been described in persons with immunosuppression, including those with advanced or untreated HIV infection. As of September 9, 2023, nearly 200,000 children under 18 years have required hospital admission for COVID-19, and more than 1,600 children have died, and within the United States the proportions of variants circulating in different parts of the country are reported on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Data Tracker website.

### Risk assessment and management of COVID-19 among travelers arriving at designated U.S. airports, January 17-September 13, 2020 [^114HQRuZ]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

These findings demonstrate that temperature and symptom screening at airports detected few COVID-19 cases and required considerable resources. The observed yield was approximately one identified case per 85,000 travelers screened. Reasons for the low yield were likely multifactorial and might have included an overall low COVID-19 prevalence in travelers; the relatively long incubation period; an illness presentation with a wide range of severity, afebrile cases, and nonspecific symptoms common to other infections; asymptomatic infections; and travelers who might deny symptoms or take steps to avoid detection of illness (e.g. through use of antipyretic or cough suppressant medications).

SARS-CoV-2 presents a formidable control challenge because asymptomatic (i.e. never symptomatic) and presymptomatic (i.e. contagious infections before symptom onset) infections can result in substantial transmission, which was unknown early in the pandemic. The proxy for infectiousness, viral shedding in the upper respiratory tract, is greatest early in the course of infection, before prominent symptoms are apparent, suggesting peak infectiousness at or before symptom onset.

### SARS-CoV-2 detection, viral load and infectivity over the course of an infection [^112XwCpo]. The Journal of Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To summarise the evidence on the detection pattern and viral load of SARS-CoV-2 over the course of an infection (including any asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic phase), and the duration of infectivity.

Methods

A systematic literature search was undertaken in PubMed, Europe PubMed Central and EMBASE from 30 December 2019 to 12 May 2020.

Results

We identified 113 studies conducted in 17 countries. The evidence from upper respiratory tract samples suggests that the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 peaks around symptom onset or a few days thereafter, and becomes undetectable about two weeks after symptom onset; however, viral loads from sputum samples may be higher, peak later and persist for longer. There is evidence of prolonged virus detection in stool samples, with unclear clinical significance. No study was found that definitively measured the duration of infectivity; however, patients may not be infectious for the entire duration of virus detection, as the presence of viral ribonucleic acid may not represent transmissible live virus.

Conclusion

There is a relatively consistent trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 viral load over the course of COVID-19 from respiratory tract samples, however the duration of infectivity remains uncertain.

### The variants question: what is the problem? [^114Eqjp8]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

What we have known all along is the ability of the virus to mutate, without warning and without changing its characteristics in the interaction with humans. Mutations are significant only in a few cases and become interesting only when they are part of its strategy of adaptation and survival.

In parallel to the scientific discussion over time in the society of real‐time information, faced with a "minute‐by‐minute" story of the main global event (a planetary emergency in a hyper‐connected world), the traditional approach of the media has proved to be quite ineffective in explaining this phenomenon. Unfortunately, very often, the journalistic‐chronicle angle has prevailed over the scientific‐dissemination point of view.

The discovery of variants was indeed considered as a sudden event and presented with astonishment when it was an unpredictable (but expected) event that only deserved to be accurately explained.

A first observation: when did we start talking about variants? We started when concerns emerged about the so‐called "English variant" (Alpha variant). Until that moment topics of mutations and variants had always remained in the background. Mutations were just a possibility that the virus was not yet expressing one important way, not least because for several months many insignificant variants had been observed. For months since the end of 2019, the virus remained almost unchanged, still in the form that has made it highly contagious and not very lethal: most of the mutations that have occurred (by March 2020 there were more than 160) did not give the virus an evolutionary advantage over humans and were therefore essentially irrelevant.

One year after the outbreak, each country is still struggling to control the pandemic by implementing several different measures. Identifying variants of concern have now become crucial, even though meaningful epidemiological data are still lacking in many cases. A few of the most advanced countries have developed effective epidemiological surveillance systems, while others are still in the process of expanding their current ones. For this reason, data coming from these few countries with an adequate surveillance system tends to influence all the others.

### SARS-CoV-2 transmission from people without COVID-19 symptoms [^111M9ELz]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

As severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the novel coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), began to spread globally, it became apparent that the virus, unlike the closely related SARS-CoV in the 2003 outbreak, could not be contained by symptom-based screening alone. Asymptomatic and clinically mild infections were uncommon during the 2003 SARS-CoV outbreak, and there were no reported instances of transmission from persons before the onset of symptoms.SARS-CoV-2 spread faster than SARS-CoV, and accumulating evidence showed that SARS-CoV-2, unlike SARS-CoV, is transmitted from persons without symptoms. However, measures to reduce transmission from individuals who do not have COVID-19 symptoms have become controversial and politicized and have likely had negative effects on the economy and many societal activities. Optimal control of COVID-19 depends on directing resources and health messaging to mitigation efforts that are most likely to prevent transmission. The relative importance of mitigation measures that prevent transmission from persons without symptoms has been disputed. Determining the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmission that occurs from persons without symptoms is foundational to prioritizing control practices and policies.

Transmission by persons who are infected but do not have any symptoms can arise from 2 different infection states: presymptomatic individuals (who are infectious before developing symptoms) and individuals who never experience symptoms (asymptomatic infections, which we will refer to as never symptomatic). Early modeling studies of COVID-19 case data found that the generation interval of SARS-CoV-2 was shorter than the serial interval, indicating that the average time between 1 person being infected and that person infecting someone else was shorter than the average time between 1 person developing symptoms and the person they infected developing symptoms. This finding meant that the epidemic was growing faster than would be expected if transmission were limited to the period of illness during which individuals were symptomatic. By the time a second generation of individuals was developing symptoms, a third generation was already being infected. Epidemiological data from early in the pandemic also suggested the possibility of presymptomatic transmission, and laboratory studies confirmed that levels of viral RNA in respiratory secretions were already high at the time of symptom onset.

### Clinical significance and pathogenesis of viral respiratory infections [^115q3tXt]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Viral respiratory tract infections, also known as colds, are the most common infection in humans. The majority of these infections are caused by rhinoviruses. Rhinovirus deposition in the nose or the eye initiates infection. The virus attaches to the host cell intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) receptors in the back of the throat. Subsequent viral replication triggers the release of inflammatory mediators and activation of neurogenic pathways, which lead to symptoms. Symptoms occur within 10 to 16 hours after virus entry into the nose and peak on days 2 to 3 of infection. Symptom duration is typically 1 week, although 25% of cases last longer. Understanding the chronology of these events is important in the timing of treatment. Because of the rapidity of symptom onset, early treatment is the key to reducing viral replication and illness. Also, early treatment may reduce the risk of transmission.

Influenza — epidemiology and transmission in children with and exposed to HIV — describes close-range droplet spread, incubation, and shedding parameters. Influenza viruses are spread directly from person to person across distances up to 6 feet, the incubation period is 1 to 4 days (mean: 2 days), adults can shed virus from 1 day before to 5 to 7 days after onset of symptoms, and children from several days before to ≥ 10 days after illness onset. Viral shedding can occur over longer periods in those with chronic diseases, including patients with immunosuppression or those receiving systemic corticosteroid therapy.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) in pediatric family-centered residential facilities — entry, restriction, and education are outlined as follows: HSV remains in the body after first infection and reactivation is common, and transmission occurs through contact with infected sores or contaminated secretions with no vaccine available. Individuals with isolated labial cold sores may be allowed entry if capable of frequent hand hygiene and can follow instructions not to kiss others; if young or incapable of hand hygiene, they should not be admitted unless the sore is completely crusted and dry, and if permitting entry they should be restricted to their private room until the rash is completely crusted and dry. Restrict those with primary herpes gingivostomatitis with active sores and drooling from entering the facility and, once recovered, require written medical clearance stating the patient is no longer contagious. Allow exposed individuals without symptoms of illness to stay without restriction, and educate families on frequent hand hygiene, avoidance of sharing personal items, prompt removal and careful handling of potentially contaminated items, and advise families to avoid direct, close contact with rashes to prevent person-to-person transmission.

Mitigation of the Risk of Infection

One of the key interventions needed to maximize the benefit–risk balance for each individual patient is to implement all the measures needed to minimize the risk of infection. The insidious onset of the infection, which may present with a long incubation period without any obvious clinical symptoms and even remain asymptomatic or with mild symptoms for its entire course, favors the diffusion of the infection because of the contagiousness of these patients [8]. The approach adopted in some countries, including Italy, of performing COVID‐19 testing only for symptomatic patients or health care workers contributes to making hospitals places at higher risk of COVID‐19 transmission.

Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Are there exceptions?

Yes, severely immunocompromised patients may be an exception. Based on data from other viral infections, patients with COVID-19 infection who are severely immunocompromised may have prolonged shedding of live virus. Thus, decisions regarding discontinuing isolation precautions for severely immunocompromised patients, or possibly those who are otherwise critically ill with COVID-19 infection, should be based on a high SARS-CoV-2 PCR cycle threshold. Importantly, the cycle threshold varies depending on the PCR protocol and amplification target used in the PCR assay. Such patients, and all others, should continue to follow CDC and local health official guidance regarding continued source control after hospital discharge (ie, mask use and hand hygiene), as well as social distancing.

### SHEA practice update: infection prevention and control (IPC) in residential facilities for pediatric patients and their families [^111AFVPV]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). High credibility.

Measles — background for infection prevention in residential facilities describes a highly contagious viral infection spread when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks, with infection occurring by breathing contaminated air (the virus stays in the air for up to two hours) or by touching a contaminated surface and then the eyes, noses, or mouths. Measles commonly presents with fever, cough, nasal congestion, conjunctivitis (pink eye), and a red rash that begins on the face then spreads to the entire body, and complications can include ear infections, pneumonia, croup, hepatitis, encephalitis, and diarrhea. Individuals are contagious from 4 days before the onset of rash through 4 days after the rash appears. Measles remains a leading cause of childhood disease and death globally, with recent outbreaks due to importation by travelers and infections in individuals who are immunized incompletely.

### Pragmatic recommendations for infection prevention and control practices for healthcare facilities in low-and middle-income countries during the COVID-19 pandemic [^111gMS1W]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

QUESTIONS

We formulated three clearly defined questions regarding IPC practices in healthcare facilities:
1 Should hospitalized patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in LMICs be cohorted and, if so, how?
2 Should HCWs taking care of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in LMICs care exclusively for those patients?
3 Should visiting policies be altered for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in LMICs?

Should hospitalized patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in LMICs be cohorted and, if so, how?

Rationale.

Infection prevention and control strategies are an important part of limiting transmission of respiratory viruses in healthcare settings. A key aspect of IPC involves early detection and isolation of cases. In HICs, isolation within healthcare facilities is often achieved by using single-occupancy isolation rooms. In LMICs, this approach may not always be feasible because of limited availability of isolation rooms. A 2020 Cochrane review found that lack of adequate isolation rooms is perceived as major barrier to IPC practices by HCWs, particularly in LMICs. When isolation rooms are limited, are cohorting strategies effective in preventing nosocomial transmission? What cohorting strategies should be used to isolate patients with COVID-19 or suspected COVID-19?

Search results.

We searched PubMed and the Cochrane Library using combinations of the following Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) or free-text words: "cohorting AND COVID-19", "patient isolation AND COVID-19", "infection control/methods AND COVID-19", "respiratory tract infections/prevention and control AND COVID-19", and "pandemics/prevention and control AND COVID-19" through November 1, 2020. The PubMed search yielded 7,824 articles, including 89 systematic reviews. Overall, 2,066 articles were from LMICs. Few studies from LMICs directly addressed the question of interest. As such, we discuss the literature and guidelines from both HICs and LMICs, which may inform recommendations. One Cochrane systematic review addressing IPC practices to prevent transmission of respiratory viruses was identified.

### Common childhood viral infections [^112Jggxo]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2015). Low credibility.

Infections caused by viruses are universal during childhood and adolescence. Clinicians will regularly care for children and adolescents who present with infections caused by a wide number of viral pathogens. These infections have varied presentations. Many infections may have clinical presentations that are specific to the infecting virus but present differently, based on the age and immunocompetence of the patient. Some children are directly impacted early in their lives when maternal disease results in an in utero infection (cytomegalovirus, rubella virus, or parvovirus B19). Other viruses may infect children in a predictable pattern as they grow older (rhinovirus or influenza virus). Fortunately, many viral infections frequently encountered in the past are no longer extant due to widespread immunization efforts. Recognition of these vaccine-preventable infections is important because outbreaks of some of these diseases (mumps or measles) continue to occur in the United States. Vigilance in vaccine programs against these viral agents can prevent their re-emergence. In addition, an increasing number of viral infections (herpes simplex virus, influenza virus, varicella zoster virus, or cytomegalovirus) can now be successfully treated with antiviral medications. Most viral infections in children result in self-limited illness and are treated symptomatically and infected children experience full recovery. This review will address the epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of viral infections commonly encountered by the clinician.

### Temporal dynamics in viral shedding and transmissibility of COVID-19 [^114MTwsZ]. Nature Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

We report temporal patterns of viral shedding in 94 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and modeled COVID-19 infectiousness profiles from a separate sample of 77 infector-infectee transmission pairs. We observed the highest viral load in throat swabs at the time of symptom onset, and inferred that infectiousness peaked on or before symptom onset. We estimated that 44% (95% confidence interval, 25–69%) of secondary cases were infected during the index cases' presymptomatic stage, in settings with substantial household clustering, active case finding and quarantine outside the home. Disease control measures should be adjusted to account for probable substantial presymptomatic transmission.

What is COVID-19?

COVID-19 is caused by a virus called a coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). You can get COVID-19 through contact with another person who has the virus.

COVID-19 illnesses have ranged from very mild (including some with no reported symptoms) to severe, including illness resulting in death. While information so far suggests that most COVID‑19 illnesses are mild, serious illness can happen and may cause some of your other medical conditions to become worse. Older people and people of all ages with severe, long lasting (chronic) medical conditions like immune compromise, heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, and obesity, for example, seem to be at higher risk of being hospitalized for COVID‑19.

### SARS-CoV-2 variants retain high airborne transmissibility by different strategies [^111UHCKb]. Npj Viruses (2025). Medium credibility.

The IVT was used to measure airborne viral emission on 4 and 5 dpi, but no plaques were detected (Fig. S5a), even though infectious virus could still be detected in the nasal wash samples, albeit it at several logs lower infectious titres than on day 1 and 2 (Fig. 1a). Notably, an increase in the ratio between gene copies and plaques (Fig. 3d) was observed in the nasal wash samples collected from donor hamsters as the infection progressed, suggesting the infectiousness of virus decreased, or that the later nasal washes contained significant amounts of viral RNA released from dead infected cells. Together, our results suggest that Delta-infected hamsters are most contagious early after infection, and contagiousness decreases rapidly over time. Airborne infectious viral emission, as assessed by the IVT, correlated temporally with airborne transmissibility, providing an accurate prediction for airborne transmission. In contrast, virus load in the nasal wash assessed by PCR overestimated the duration of contagiousness.

### Coronavirus disease 2019 and airborne transmission: science rejected, lives lost. can society Do better? [^117E4WbW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

THE BEGINNING — THE PANDEMIC UNFOLDS

In January 2020, we all watched the news about a virus causing a rapidly increasing number of respiratory cases and deaths in Wuhan, China. Many asked: "Can it be controlled?"

In the minds of natural scientists, medical professionals, engineers, and experts from numerous related fields, who have devoted their careers to studying the many elements of airborne infection transmission and to developing solutions to control it, the early reports left no doubt that this was a respiratory virus. As such, curtailing airborne transmission had to be on the table as one of the key elements in controlling the epidemic before it became a pandemic.

The first signs of a serious problem were detected by China. Professor Junji Cao from the Chinese Academy of Sciences was worried that the airborne transmission route of the virus might not be well recognized. He shared his concerns with Professor Lidia Morawska of Queensland University of Technology, Australia, on 7 February 2020. This communication raised the question of what could be done. Should we contact the authorities and alert them to this situation?

The situation was rapidly changing. Cao and Morawska collaborated on a commentary entitled "Airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2: the world should face the reality". They aimed as high as they could, contacting the editors of 2 top journals in turn and argued for the need to spread this message, but to no avail. The response from one of the editors on 1 April 2020 was, "We appreciate that it is important to take into consideration long-distance airborne transmission by COVID-19. However, we feel that this possibility is acknowledged by authorities and by the scientific community alike, and is being considered in different publications".

It became clear that it would not be easy to get this message across as a publication (the paper was eventually published by Environment International on 7 April 2020).

Nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for ending isolation — potential benefits, harms, and considerations: Potential benefits of NAAT to remove a patient from isolation might be definitive proof that a patient is not infectious, but such proof does not exist; potential harms include unnecessary prolongation of isolation with attendant consequences and unnecessary financial costs that should be considered. The decision to remove an individual from isolation involves assessing the person's contagiousness; viral culture is less sensitive for diagnosis than NAAT and methods are not standardized, and NAAT testing remains positive for days to weeks longer than viral culture. Many additional factors can affect transmission risk, including immune status and vaccination history, mask type, exposure duration, and ventilation of the exposure space.

IDSA COVID-19 infection prevention guidelines — abstract overview describes risk context, scope, methods, and outputs. Since its emergence in late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 continues to pose a risk to healthcare personnel (HCP) and patients, with actions like coughing and aerosol-generating procedures likely having a higher risk of transmission. The objective is to develop evidence-based rapid guidelines to support HCP in decisions about infection prevention when caring for patients with suspected or known COVID-19. Methods included forming a multidisciplinary panel, following a rapid recommendation checklist, conducting a systematic review of peer-reviewed and grey literature, and using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess certainty of evidence and make recommendations. The guideline panel agreed on eight recommendations, including two updated recommendations and one new recommendation added since the first version, and narrative summaries of other interventions undergoing evaluations are included.

### Waiting for the truth: is reluctance in accepting an early origin hypothesis for SARS-CoV-2 delaying our understanding of viral emergence? [^1168dV8c]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Two years after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, key questions about the emergence of its aetiological agent (SARS-CoV-2) remain a matter of considerable debate. Identifying when SARS-CoV-2 began spreading among people is one of those questions. Although the current canonically accepted timeline hypothesises viral emergence in Wuhan, China, in November or December 2019, a growing body of diverse studies provides evidence that the virus may have been spreading worldwide weeks, or even months, prior to that time. However, the hypothesis of earlier SARS-CoV-2 circulation is often dismissed with prejudicial scepticism and experimental studies pointing to early origins are frequently and speculatively attributed to false-positive tests. In this paper, we critically review current evidence that SARS-CoV-2 had been circulating prior to December of 2019, and emphasise how, despite some scientific limitations, this hypothesis should no longer be ignored and considered sufficient to warrant further larger-scale studies to determine its veracity.

### Current insights into respiratory virus transmission and potential implications for infection control programs: a narrative review [^112oJsZs]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Policies to prevent respiratory virus transmission in health care settings have traditionally divided organisms into Droplet versus Airborne categories. Droplet organisms (for example, influenza) are said to be transmitted via large respiratory secretions that rapidly fall to the ground within 1 to 2 meters and are adequately blocked by surgical masks. Airborne pathogens (for example, measles), by contrast, are transmitted by aerosols that are small enough and light enough to carry beyond 2 meters and to penetrate the gaps between masks and faces; health care workers are advised to wear N95 respirators and to place these patients in negative-pressure rooms. Respirators and negative-pressure rooms are also recommended when caring for patients with influenza or SARS-CoV-2 who are undergoing "aerosol-generating procedures", such as intubation. An increasing body of evidence, however, questions this framework. People routinely emit respiratory particles in a range of sizes, but most are aerosols, and most procedures do not generate meaningfully more aerosols than ordinary breathing, and far fewer than coughing, exercise, or labored breathing. Most transmission nonetheless occurs at close range because virus-laden aerosols are most concentrated at the source; they then diffuse and dilute with distance, making long-distance transmission rare in well-ventilated spaces. The primary risk factors for nosocomial transmission are community incidence rates, viral load, symptoms, proximity, duration of exposure, and poor ventilation. Failure to appreciate these factors may lead to underappreciation of some risks (for example, overestimation of the protection provided by medical masks, insufficient attention to ventilation) or misallocation of limited resources (for example, reserving N95 respirators and negative-pressure rooms only for aerosol-generating procedures or requiring negative-pressure rooms for all patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection regardless of stage of illness). Enhanced understanding of the factors governing respiratory pathogen transmission may inform the development of more effective policies to prevent nosocomial transmission of respiratory pathogens.

### Prospective, real-time metagenomic sequencing during norovirus outbreak reveals discrete transmission clusters [^112BxMKn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

In some other viral species, viruses that evolve in immunocompromised hosts seem to predict broader evolutionary trends. It is currently unknown whether noroviruses from immunocompromised hosts influence viral evolution, or even if viral transmission from chronically infected patients is possible. It seems unlikely, though, that viruses from immunocompromised hosts have no impact on norovirus evolution, given that there are many degrees of immunocompromise, that the number of immunocompromised individuals continues to increase, and that immunocompromised patients have frequent contact with the health-care system and each other.

This study was limited by our inability to obtain specimens from ill staff, as most otherwise-healthy patients do not seek medical attention for norovirus infection and hospital staff often seek care from outside providers. A further limitation was the study's mostly retrospective nature. While the use of Illumina sequencing allows for high-quality deep sequencing, the cost of reagent cartridges forces labs to use them in batched sequencing processes, which somewhat limited our ability to perform a true "real-time" analysis. Finally, our failure to recover genomes from some samples illustrates the challenges of working with clinical samples, as we saw variable viral RNA quality and quantity using mNGS, as compared with other methods, such as capture sequencing, that require longer turnaround times. Stool is a particularly daunting sample source, given the number and diversity of other organisms present.

Overall, our results demonstrate how metagenomics methods can be employed in outbreak investigations to elucidate intricate details about pathogen transmission. This information is vital to efforts aimed at optimizing infection-control interventions. Our findings underscore the critical importance of these interventions, in both inpatient and ambulatory settings, to prevent the transmission of pathogens in health-care facilities. Infectious control efforts are perhaps particularly crucial for norovirus, a common and highly contagious organism that can have lasting impacts on medical systems and on vulnerable patient populations.

### Clinical and molecular characteristics of COVID-19 patients with persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection [^115XgGg8]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

The duration of viral shedding has been reported to vary dramatically and the longest period of viral PCR positive lasts more than 100 days. Our previous studyshowed that even in the 5th week after the onset of symptoms, the positive rate of viral PCR in the tested samples remained around 20%. More alarmingly, recent studyreported that virus particles were still observed in SARS-CoV-2 cultured in nasopharyngeal swabs though transmission electron microscopy even 70 days after diagnosis, supporting that SARS-CoV-2 has the ability to alive for a long time and persistently contagious. Therefore, persistent infection potentially increases the risk of transmission, leading to the consumption of additional hospital resources and greater economic costs. Accordingly, in addition to paying attention to the severity of the COVID-19 disease, it is also important to explore the clinical, molecular characteristics and mechanisms of long-term of viral infections.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular testing — conclusions and research needs state coordination and priority settings for asymptomatic exposed individuals, specifying that "Testing in asymptomatic subjects with known or suspected exposures should be coordinated with local public health officials", and this is "especially important in situations where knowledge of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infection is essential for determining medical follow-up, defining risks for other vulnerable individuals in a household, congregate setting or hospital"; it further notes "Special consideration should also be given to healthcare personnel exposed without appropriate PPE in healthcare settings", and calls for "Comparative studies (preferably randomized controlled trials) along with cost-effectiveness analyses of testing strategies in asymptomatic populations", "Studies on the ideal time and collection method", and clarification of "what constitutes an exposure that would justify testing"; it adds that whether early diagnosis changes outcomes "is unknown", though "the opportunity for therapeutic intervention might justify screening exposed individuals", with benefits that "might vary depending on underlying diseases, immune status, age, and vaccination status… and their prior history of COVID-19 infection".

### Why are there so few (or so many) circulating coronaviruses? [^117QJNDn]. Trends in Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite vast diversity in non-human hosts and conspicuous recent spillover events, only a small number of coronaviruses have been observed to persist in human populations. This puzzling mismatch suggests substantial barriers to establishment. We detail hypotheses that might contribute to explain the low numbers of endemic coronaviruses, despite their considerable evolutionary and emergence potential. We assess possible explanations ranging from issues of ascertainment, historically lower opportunities for spillover, aspects of human demographic changes, and features of pathogen biology and pre-existing adaptive immunity to related viruses. We describe how successful emergent viral species must triangulate transmission, virulence, and host immunity to maintain circulation. Characterizing the factors that might shape the limits of viral persistence can delineate promising research directions to better understand the combinations of pathogens and contexts that are most likely to lead to spillover.

### SHEA practice update: infection prevention and control (IPC) in residential facilities for pediatric patients and their families [^116rcB63]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). High credibility.

Varicella-zoster virus (chickenpox) — entry, exposure, and clearance protocols for family-centered residential facilities specify the following: Restrict individuals with suspected or active chickenpox from entrance. Once the rash has crusted and the patient does not have a fever, they may be allowed to enter the facility, but prior to entry require written medical clearance confirming the rash has completely crusted and the person is no longer contagious. Restrict individuals with exposures to chickenpox until they meet criteria with written medical clearance; to be considered not contagious, a person must meet 1 of 4 criteria: past history of chickenpox or shingles diagnosed by a healthcare professional; documentation of 2 doses of varicella-containing vaccine separated by at least 3 months; documented varicella antibodies (positive varicella IgG blood test); or at least 21 days since last significant exposure (28 days after exposure if post-exposure prophylaxis such as intravenous immune globulin or varicella zoster immune globulin was received). A person with chickenpox is highly contagious starting from 2 days before the first appearance of the rash until all the blisters have completely dried and crusted. If diagnosed, request suspected individuals leave for medical evaluation, require medical clearance for readmission, and immediately notify the local public health department; post-exposure prophylaxis must be administered within 10 days of exposure to varicella.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^115pxXHv]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Time to adequate suppression after starting antiretroviral therapy — A subgroup analysis from the Partners PrEP Study only included the 1,573 heterosexual East African couples in which the partners without HIV were randomized to the placebo arm and were tested monthly for HIV, while the viral load of the partner with HIV was assessed every 6 months. Three phylogenetically linked infections were diagnosed in the 6 months prior to the first follow-up visit for the partners with HIV, with an observed incidence rate of 1.79 per 100 person-years during this initial 6-month period after the partner with HIV started ART that was slightly less than the 2.08 per person-years incidence rate observed in couples in which the person with HIV was not receiving ART. Viral suppression in this study was defined as < 40 copies/mL, and the three infections were diagnosed at 0 days, 56 days, and 149 days after the partner with HIV started ART and before documented viral suppression. After the partners with HIV had been taking ART for ≥ 6 months, no further transmissions were observed. The Panel recommends that people with HIV who are starting ART should use another form of prevention with sexual partners for at least the first 6 months of treatment and until a viral load of < 200 copies/mL is reached, and confirming sustained viral suppression is recommended before assuming that sexual transmission of HIV is no longer a risk (AIII).

### Risk period for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal influenza: a rapid review [^115jfedT]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Work restrictions applied to potentially contagious HCWs in U.S. healthcare settings are typically longer than those applied to people in the community. In healthcare settings, decisions about the duration of work restriction for HCWs have historically relied primarily on viral shedding data despite their limitations. Ideally, the duration can be informed by observations of transmission collected in epidemiologic studies to give a more complete picture of transmission risk. Decisions about work restrictions will balance the benefits of reducing risk of transmission with potential unintended consequences of work restrictions like changes to staffing that could impact safe patient care or a safe work environment.

Other infection prevention and control measures may shorten the duration of viral shedding or reduce the risk of transmission of influenza or omicron. Limited evidence suggests there may be a reduction in the duration of viral shedding in vaccinated adults who are mildly ill with omicron, and no evidence was retrieved on the effect of vaccination on influenza shedding, therefore the effect of vaccination status on shedding duration to inform decisions about duration of work restrictions is unclear. Additional studies may clarify this relationship but could vary by pathogen. For influenza, neuraminidase inhibitors have been shown to reduce viral shedding by 1–2 days and may reduce the risk for transmission to others. Although decreases in viral shedding have been reported for adults receiving Paxlovid for omicron infections, the risk for rebound viremia may negate potential for decreasing risk for transmission to others. Finally, masking of potentially contagious individuals for source control is a strategy that can reduce the risk for transmission to others in healthcare settings. However, the potential reduction in risk is difficult to quantify and may be imperfect because it depends on factors such as how well the mask fits and whether it is consistently and correctly worn at all times. This suggests that masking for source control is not to be relied upon to replace exclusion of contagious HCWs from work, particularly when HCWs are most contagious.

### Effect of SARS-CoV-2 prior infection and mRNA vaccination on contagiousness and susceptibility to infection [^111hPjUx]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Compared to non-vaccinated and never-infected person, vaccination was protective for both index and contacts, the effect for the index being smaller than for contacts, as reported previously. Because of the waning of the vaccine-induced immunityand the immune escape of successive variants when compared to the previous ones, the timing of the last vaccination and the VoC concerned were important, especially for the contact. Vaccination, even when performed less than 6 months before, did not add any protection to contacts during the omicron wave. On the other hand, the escaping capacities of omicron did not affect the reduction of infectiousness conferred by recent vaccination. This suggests that vaccine still lowers the viral load of persons infected by Omicron, in agreement with the fact that vaccine diminishes the occurrence of severe disease for this VoC. Although vaccination more than 6 months ago still had some effect on the infectiousness of index cases, it added no protection against infection for the contacts during delta wave, and even had an opposite effect (i.e. an increase of the SAR) during the omicron wave. This counterintuitive effect might be due to a combination of the strong immune escape of this variantand the tendency of vaccinated people to comply less with COVID-19 mitigation strategies, such as physical distancing and mask recommendations. Such result has been observed in a previous study. Infected unvaccinated indexes had a reduced SAR across all variants. This reduction was higher than the one observed for vaccination for Delta, but not for Omicron, in agreement with recent measurement of viral load dynamics. Previous infection also showed a strong protective effect against being infected for the contacts, even more after adjusting for their tendency to test. This protection is reduced after 6 months. The waning of this protection conferred by previous infection is rather small for early variants, in line with the recently observed slower immunity waning after infection when compared to vaccine, but is substantial for Delta and Omicron, due to their stronger potential for immune escape. This protection against infection was higher than vaccination for all variants (up to 7 times higher for Omicron, in agreement with recent estimate of Gazit and co-authors). This higher and longer lasting protection of the infection when compared to vaccine-induced immunity may find its root in a more global immune response and may be due to specific IgA response. Hybrid immunity provided stronger protection and reduction of infectiousness than vaccines, as observed elsewhere, but no higher than recent infection, in agreement with a large Israeli study.

### Ebola virus disease: focus on children [^11162nMt]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Ebola virus is one of the most deadly pathogens known to infect humans. The current Ebola outbreak in West Africa is unprecedented in magnitude and duration and, as of November 30, 2014, shows no signs of abating. For the first time, cases of Ebola virus disease have been diagnosed in the US, originating from patients who traveled during the incubation period. The outbreak has generated worldwide concern. It is clear that U.S. physicians need to be aware of this disease, know when to consider Ebola and how to care for the patient as well as protect themselves. Children comprise a small percentage of all cases globally, likely because of their lower risk of exposure given social and cultural practices. Limited evidence is available on pediatric disease course and prognosis. In this article, we present an overview of the pathogen, its epidemiology and transmission, clinical and laboratory manifestations, treatment and infection control procedures, with an emphasis on what is known about Ebola virus disease in the pediatric population.

### Vilobelimab (Gohibic) [^111TAG5L]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

What is COVID-19?

COVID-19 is caused by a virus called a coronavirus. You can get COVID-19 through contact with another person who has the virus.

COVID-19 illnesses have ranged from very mild (including some with no reported symptoms) to severe, including illness resulting in death. While information so far suggests that most COVID-19 illness is mild, serious illness can happen and may cause some of your other medical conditions to become worse. People of all ages with severe, long-lasting (chronic) medical conditions like heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes, for example, seem to be at higher risk of being hospitalized for COVID-19.

What are the symptoms of COVID-19?

The symptoms of COVID-19 may include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, which can appear 2 to 14 days after exposure. Serious illness, including breathing problems, can occur and may cause your other medical conditions to become worse.

What is GOHIBIC?

GOHIBIC is an investigational medicine used for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized adults when initiated within 48 hours of receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). GOHIBIC is investigational because it is still being studied. GOHIBIC is not FDA-approved to treat COVID-19.

### Epidemic modelling suggests that in specific circumstances masks may become more effective when fewer contacts wear them [^113xSTJC]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The small coverage effect, therefore, occurs when the duration of the outbreak size and the speed with which measure adherence wanes match each other in a certain relationship. Namely, the waning process must occur on a timescale where a sufficient number of individuals stop adhering while the number of infections is still high enough, i.e. the outbreak is still unfolding. The question then arises as to how exact this matching of the two timescales must be for the small coverage effect to occur. If the outbreak has already ended before there was substantial waning or if adherence has already completely waned before the outbreak even took off, one would expect a strongly diminished small coverage effect.

We find that the effect appears for a broad range of transmission rates, network connectivity, and waning rates of adherence. Specifically, there is no small coverage effect for parameter settings where the initial outbreak is suppressed (e.g. low transmission rates and/or low network connectivity) or where the waning rate is zero. Our simulations suggest that the maximum small coverage effect is observed above, but close to, the thresholds where initial outbreaks are no longer suppressed. If transmission rates or network connectivity increases even further, more infections have already occurred before substantial waning has taken place and the small coverage effect decreases in magnitude.

The small coverage effect also decreases in magnitude as the waning rate becomes larger (q becomes smaller). The faster the waning process, the shorter the timespan in which the process can interact with the unfolding outbreak.

Homophily amplifies the small coverage effect. This is probably related to local trapping of infection events in the network. Smaller groups of adopters that are preferentially connected to each other are less likely to be affected in the early stages of the outbreak, when adherence is still high. This is because each adopter is likely to be connected to others who are also adopting, thus protecting each other. They are also less likely to be affected by large numbers of infections in non-adopting individuals because they have fewer links with them. It will take longer for the pathogen to invade these groups of mutually protecting individuals than it would in a situation without homophily. Therefore, as homophily increases, there is a greater chance that the outbreak will be over before there has been any substantial decline in protective behaviour.

### Recommendations for HIV prevention with adults and adolescents with HIV in the United States, 2014 [^1136TF5x]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Policy, legal, and ethical considerations — voluntariness, counseling, and risk communication: Use of ART for health or prevention benefits should be voluntary. The principal consideration in decisions about using ART is personal health, not reducing risk of HIV transmission. Clinical providers can help patients make informed choices about ART use by stressing that ART is the single most important intervention they can choose to maintain their health, prolong their lives, and reduce the risk of infecting others; noting potential harms, such as side effects; and reassuring patients who decline ART that they will not be denied medical or social services. Clinical providers can caution their patients that sustained high adherence to ART substantially reduces the risk of transmission, but it may not eliminate the risk, and can also discourage risk compensation, which may lead to deferral of condom use or of other safer sex or drug-injection behaviors. HIV-uninfected persons who use nPEP or PrEP also can benefit from knowing that these regimens may reduce, but may not eliminate, their risk of HIV acquisition. Risk compensation is modifying sex or drug-injection behaviors in ways that increases risk of HIV transmission or acquisition when other safeguards are introduced (e.g., when persons with HIV who believe that ART use reduces their infectiousness no longer use condoms to prevent HIV transmission).

### How flu spreads | Influenza (flu) [^113XSx5C]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

What to know
- Experts think that influenza viruses spread mainly by droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze, or talk.
- Less often, a person might get influenza by touching a surface or object that has influenza virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes.
- Influenza viruses can be detected in most infected people beginning one day before symptoms develop and up to five to seven days after becoming sick.
- People with flu are the most contagious during the first three days of their illness. Why it spreads People with flu can spread it to others. Most experts think that influenza viruses spread mainly by droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze, or talk. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Putting physical distance between yourself and others can help lower the risk of spreading a respiratory virus.

Less often, a person might get flu by touching a surface or object that has influenza virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. When Are People with Flu Contagious. Influenza viruses can be detected in most infected persons beginning one day before symptoms develop and up to five to seven days after becoming sick. People with flu are most contagious during the first three days of their illness. Some people, including young children and people with weakened immune systems may be contagious for longer periods of time. Symptoms typically begin about two days after influenza viruses infect a person's respiratory tract. It is theoretically possible that before symptoms begin, an infected person can spread influenza viruses to their close contacts. Some people can be infected with influenza viruses and have no symptoms but may still be able to spread the virus to their close contacts.

### SARS-CoV-2 transmission from people without COVID-19 symptoms [^112VdwSK]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is readily transmitted person to person. Optimal control of COVID-19 depends on directing resources and health messaging to mitigation efforts that are most likely to prevent transmission, but the relative importance of such measures has been disputed.

Objective

To assess the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions in the community that likely occur from persons without symptoms.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This decision analytical model assessed the relative amount of transmission from presymptomatic, never symptomatic, and symptomatic individuals across a range of scenarios in which the proportion of transmission from people who never develop symptoms (ie, remain asymptomatic) and the infectious period were varied according to published best estimates. For all estimates, data from a meta-analysis was used to set the incubation period at a median of 5 days. The infectious period duration was maintained at 10 days, and peak infectiousness was varied between 3 and 7 days (-2 and +2 days relative to the median incubation period). The overall proportion of SARS-CoV-2 was varied between 0% and 70% to assess a wide range of possible proportions.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Level of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from presymptomatic, never symptomatic, and symptomatic individuals.

Results

The baseline assumptions for the model were that peak infectiousness occurred at the median of symptom onset and that 30% of individuals with infection never develop symptoms and are 75% as infectious as those who do develop symptoms. Combined, these baseline assumptions imply that persons with infection who never develop symptoms may account for approximately 24% of all transmission. In this base case, 59% of all transmission came from asymptomatic transmission, comprising 35% from presymptomatic individuals and 24% from individuals who never develop symptoms. Under a broad range of values for each of these assumptions, at least 50% of new SARS-CoV-2 infections was estimated to have originated from exposure to individuals with infection but without symptoms.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this decision analytical model of multiple scenarios of proportions of asymptomatic individuals with COVID-19 and infectious periods, transmission from asymptomatic individuals was estimated to account for more than half of all transmissions. In addition to identification and isolation of persons with symptomatic COVID-19, effective control of spread will require reducing the risk of transmission from people with infection who do not have symptoms. These findings suggest that measures such as wearing masks, hand hygiene, social distancing, and strategic testing of people who are not ill will be foundational to slowing the spread of COVID-19 until safe and effective vaccines are available and widely used.

### The duration of infectiousness of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 [^114iSKxL]. The Journal of Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To summarise the evidence on the duration of infectiousness of individuals in whom SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid is detected.

Methods

A rapid review was undertaken in PubMed, Europe PubMed Central and EMBASE from 1 January 2020 to 26 August 2020.

Results

We identified 15 relevant studies, including 13 virus culture and 2 contact tracing studies. For 5 virus culture studies, the last day on which SARS-CoV-2 was isolated occurred within 10 days of symptom onset. For another 5 studies, SARS-CoV-2 was isolated beyond day 10 for approximately 3% of included patients. The remaining 3 virus culture studies included patients with severe or critical disease; SARS-CoV-2 was isolated up to day 32 in one study. Two studies identified immunocompromised patients from whom SARS-CoV-2 was isolated for up to 20 days. Both contact tracing studies, when close contacts were first exposed greater than 5 days after symptom onset in the index case, found no evidence of laboratory-confirmed onward transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

Conclusion

COVID-19 patients with mild-to-moderate illness are highly unlikely to be infectious beyond 10 days of symptoms. However, evidence from a limited number of studies indicates that patients with severe-to-critical illness or who are immunocompromised, may shed infectious virus for longer.

### Occurrence of respiratory virus: time, place and person [^117UQSeF]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Respiratory viruses account for most respiratory infections. Although analysis of epidemiologic information regarding viral seasonality, sites of transmission and susceptible populations is essential to devising strategies for limiting epidemics, few long term epidemiologic studies have addressed these questions.

Methods

Epidemiologic findings identifying susceptible populations, as well as temporal and geographic patterns of infection with influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus and parainfluenza virus were reviewed.

Conclusions

Influenza is the virus most frequently associated with outbreaks of respiratory infection resulting in medical consultation as well as virus-related lethality. Similar symptom profiles and overlapping seasonality of respiratory syncytial virus and other viruses may sometimes complicate surveillance and treatment. Although vaccination and antiviral drugs are virus-specific, factors that promote transmission and thus strategies for limiting outbreaks are similar for various respiratory viruses.

### Coronavirus disease 2019 and airborne transmission: science rejected, lives lost. can society Do better? [^116XLs7f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

This is an account that should be heard of an important struggle: the struggle of a large group of experts who came together at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic to warn the world about the risk of airborne transmission and the consequences of ignoring it. We alerted the World Health Organization about the potential significance of the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the urgent need to control it, but our concerns were dismissed. Here we describe how this happened and the consequences. We hope that by reporting this story we can raise awareness of the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and the need to be open to new evidence, and to prevent it from happening again. Acknowledgement of an issue, and the emergence of new evidence related to it, is the first necessary step towards finding effective mitigation solutions.

### Transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 to close contacts, China, January-February 2020 [^1133jc3A]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Transmissibility of an emerging infectious disease is a key factor for determining transmission dynamics in a population. The basic reproductive number, R 0, indicates the average number of new cases resulting from 1 infected person in a completely susceptible population. In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The mean R 0 of COVID-19 was estimated to be in the range of 1.90–6.49, indicating a high contagiousness that led to its rapid spread across the world. Another indicator of infectiousness is secondary attack rate (SAR), which is the probability that infection occurs among susceptible persons within a reasonable incubation period after known contact with an infectious person or an infectious source. Few estimates are available for the SAR for COVID-19 and its variation by type of contact, characteristics of index case-patients and contacts, and other factors. Information about factors associated with variation in SAR could help identify persons at high risk of transmitting the virus or acquiring COVID-19. Studies have reported transmission during the incubation period of COVID-19 but with unclear quantification of risk. We estimated the SAR for COVID-19 and factors associated with risk for transmission.

### Timing of surgery after recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection [^115jyFnU]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2021). Medium credibility.

To the Editor — The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created unprecedented challenges for infection prevention experts, healthcare providers, and hospital administrative personnel. National, state, and local hospital leaders have had to rapidly adapt and update policies based on personal protective equipment and testing constraints. More recently, emerging data on presymptomatic transmission and prolonged viral shedding have created additional challenges. ‐ As the pandemic continues and states begin to allow easing of nonemergent surgery restrictions, stakeholders are now faced with the task of developing policies for surgeries on recovered COVID-19–positive patients. Based on current data for COVID-19 and prior research on viral respiratory illnesses, we propose a rational surgical policy for such patients.

Most concerns with regard to surgery in recovered COVID-19 positive patients are related to the uncertainty of the postsymptomatic infectious period. Several studies have demonstrated prolonged or intermittent viral shedding in otherwise recovered, asymptomatic patients. ‐

Accordingly, the CDC recently extended the time that recovered COVID-19 patients should remain isolated. Specifically, recovered patients should isolate for at least 10 days rather than 7 days after symptom onset and for at least 3 days after recovery. In its update, the CDC noted that replication-competent virus has not been successfully cultured > 9 days after onset of illness, but data remains either unpublished or consists of very small cohorts. To this point, the CDC has recognized such uncertainty and has allowed consideration of a more stringent test-based strategy, citing "… circumstances under which there is an especially low tolerance for postrecovery SARS-CoV-2 shedding and risk of transmitting infection. In such circumstances, employers and local public health authorities may choose to apply more stringent recommendations, such as a test-based strategy, if feasible, or a requirement for a longer period of isolation after illness resolution".

Regarding preventative measures for COVID-19 infection, more specifically with respect to isolation, WHO 2023 guidelines recommend to isolate patients with suspected or confirmed moderate COVID-19 (pneumonia) at a location (health facility, community facility, or at home) depending on the established COVID-19 care pathway. Decide on the location of isolation on a case-by-case basis and depending on the clinical presentation, requirement for supportive care, potential risk factors for severe disease, and conditions at home, including the presence of vulnerable persons in the household.

### Reply to pernio during the COVID-19 pandemic and review of inflammation patterns and mechanisms of hypercoagulability [^1144wczA]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

A probable explanation for the COVID-toes is that there is a COVID-19–induced endotheliitis, as the virus can enter endothelial cells with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. This has already been found in lungs, kidneys, and small bowel, and we know that the endothelial cells in the skin also express ACE2. Cutaneous and histopathologic similarities with chilblain lupus suggest to us that activation of the type I interferon immune response is the basis for the pathogenesis.

3. We disapprove of the practice of describing all of the reported cutaneous eruptions being seen in the COVID-19 epidemics as "viral-induced, nonspecific immunologic eruptions". Each cutaneous sign has a different pathogenesis, appears in a different subset of patients, appears at a different moment in the course of the disease, and has distinct prognostic significance for the patient and a distinct significance for the community (ie, contagiousness).

COVID-19–induced chilblains is a late-onset, cutaneous manifestation, seen in children and young adults portending an excellent disease course. The patients are either mildly or no longer contagious. This finding explains why COVID-19 nucleic acid amplification tests, including polymerase chain reaction on nasopharyngeal swabs, are usually negative in patients with COVID-toes. The concept of a different pathogenesis for each COVID-19–related eruption explains why each patient does not show all of the cutaneous signs during the course of the disease but rather only one of them at a particular moment of the clinical course.

4. Finally, we disagree with 2 major assumptions of Cavanagh et al regarding testing for COVID-19. First, symptom-based screening is inadequate and should be extended to asymptomatic patients in congregate living situations. Second, testing should not be restricted to nucleic acid amplification essays but should also be extended to include serologic testing as a further tool for investigation in the ongoing outbreak. Serologic testing will also allow a retrospective assessment of the attack rate or extent of an outbreak.COVID-toes may represent one of the clinical indicators showing immunized patients, as we progress to "herd immunity". Identification of these patients could help us end the pandemic lockdown strategy in a more responsible manner.

### SHEA practice update: infection prevention and control (IPC) in residential facilities for pediatric patients and their families [^1141cSRF]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). High credibility.

Measles — family-centered residential facility recommendations are to restrict individuals from the family-centered residential facility who are suspected or confirmed to have measles, and allow entry into the facility when they are no longer contagious, usually 4 days after the appearance of the rash; prior to entry, require written medical clearance from a licensed clinician or local public health department that states that they are no longer contagious. Restrict all individuals who have been exposed to a person with suspected or confirmed measles until they obtain written medical clearance from a licensed clinician or public health department that states that they are not at risk for transmitting the infection. Refer individuals who develop symptoms of measles, and their family members, to leave the facility immediately and receive prompt medical evaluation, and notify the medical facility in advance so that appropriate isolation precautions can be initiated and exposures to others are prevented. Contact the referring medical facility and local public health department for further instruction and assistance with testing to confirm the measles diagnosis, and if medical evaluation confirms the individual has measles, notify the person's primary care physician or licensed clinician and local public health authorities. For post-exposure management, identify and notify exposed guests and instruct them to immediately consult a licensed clinician or the public health department for possible post-exposure prophylaxis; non-immune individuals who have a normal immune system and are not pregnant should receive measles vaccine up to 72 hours after exposure, and high-risk individuals who have a compromised immune system may receive immune globulin up to 6 days after exposure to measles.

### Solidarity during the COVID-19 pandemic: evidence from a nine-country interview study in Europe [^115jmdBd]. Medical Humanities (2023). Medium credibility.

Hopefully this crisis requires a lot of solidarity with older people, with the healthcare workers, with other workers who are most affected by that. (T1IESV04)

It is like this, yes [upon being asked if the interviewee adheres to the measures]. But less out of a concern that I could become sick myself, but merely, if one does not follow it [the measures], yes, it would especially affect the generation above me that would perhaps become infected through me and, yes, it [the older generation] is clearly more in danger than I am at the moment. (T1ATBP10)

So, I am not scared that they [clients of the interviewee] carry something [contagious] for me that could harm me. it is really important to me that I don't give it to anyone who is a risk patient. And that's why one has to be careful. One never knows with whom one would have contact, if one were infected, before even knowing that one is infected. (T1CHBZ19)

On the other hand, many respondents saw instances of other people's non-compliance to public health measures as unsolidaristic:

So, we have neighbours, they party with friends every day. Which I don't find great because I then think, yes, then, firstly we will perhaps still be stuck in these lockdowns for longer when everything [the virus] breaks out again. And it could also be that people die, this I find so… it gets on my nerves if people do not at least try to get through this together as much as possible. And one day my sister, who no longer works as a nurse but she has now been called up to work as a nurse again through a compulsory measure and she had to sign a document to say she will be available up to 60 hours a week. And as she told me this, some friends arrived at my neighbours' house with bottles of wine and started making noise. And in that moment I was so angry because I thought why does my sister maybe then have to care for such idiots, I don't accept this. But yes, I don't know, such unsolidaristic behaviour really annoys me. (T1ATBP04)

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on infection prevention for health care personnel caring for patients with suspected or known COVID-19 [^113H53EE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

COVID-19 background — severity, mortality, and transmission: The first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were reported from Wuhan, China in early December 2019, and although many infected individuals are asymptomatic or exhibit a mild illness, 20% have severe or critical illness requiring hospitalization and between 3% to 20% of hospitalized people die depending on severity of illness; the mortality rate remains even higher for those patients requiring extracorporeal life support. Transmission occurs from persons incubating the disease before the onset of symptoms, from persons with mild illness, and from persons with asymptomatic infection.

### The evolution of collective infectious units in viruses [^112hhfHi]. Virus Research (2019). Medium credibility.

2.2 Group infection benefits

We first consider the possibility that infections initiated with multiple viral genomes are more successful. We assume that the expected number of future infections is larger for infectious units containing more genomes, by making s(k) an increasing function of k. This could capture different biological mechanisms, including: larger infectious units lasting longer in the environment and so surviving longer to infect a host cell; larger numbers of initial genomes leading to a faster rate of viral production throughout the course of the cellular infection; larger infectious units having a greater likelihood of initially establishing an infection, for example through overcoming cellular immune responses, or if stochastic events early in infection can cause infections to fail. The benefit to infectious units with more genomes is analogous to when animals experience benefits through dispersing in groups, rather than alone.

We assume that there is a limit to the potential benefit of multiple viral genomes infecting the same cell, and consequently that beyond a certain number of genomes, defined as k t, additional genomes no longer increase the productivity of an infected cell. Since we are interested in the relative fitness of different infectious unit sizes, we set the maximum potential benefit of larger CIUs, which is found at k t, equal to 1 and we express the success of infectious units of different sizes relative to this maximum potential benefit (y-axis of Fig. 1 b). We also assume that the number of viral genomes produced per infected cell is constant, and that there is consequently a linear trade-off between the number of infectious units that can be produced and the number of genomes in each infectious unit (Fig. 1 a). We consider the cases where the relationship between the number of viral genomes (k) and the productivity of an infected cell (s k) either shows diminishing returns, or a threshold effect (Fig. 1 b; Appendix 1).

### Role of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections in COVID-19 pandemic [^114YRMYQ]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission

Asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission of covid-19 can be inferred from epidemiological and virological data. The most important evidence comes from epidemiological studies focusing on contact tracing, which help directly determine whether infections arose in the close contacts of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic cases, and to what extent it was observed. This enables calculation of the secondary attack rate, a measure of viral infectivity defined as the number of infections that occur within the incubation period among the total number of exposed contacts. Virological studies may be supportive by determining the presence or absence of viral RNA, quantifying viral loads, assessing RNA shedding, or isolating live viruses from asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic people.

A cluster of 42 people with symptomatic covid-19 diagnosed from 23 December 2020 and onward in Beijing's Shunyi district was caused by an asymptomatic carrier from Indonesia, according to an epidemiological investigation and viral genome sequencing. This is not an isolated example. At least 12 of 33 local clusters of infections identified during April 2020 to June 2021 originated from people with no symptoms, according to data from the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention.

The secondary attack rate tends to be lower among contacts of people with pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infections than those with symptomatic infections. Two systematic reviews showed that the relative risk of infection varied from 0.35 (95% confidence interval 0.10 to 1.27) to 0.58 (0.34 to 0.99) for contacts of asymptomatic cases and was 0.63 (0.18 to 2.26) for contacts of pre-symptomatic cases.

Viral load dynamics and duration of viral shedding are notable determinants of covid-19 transmission. However, data regarding SARS-CoV-2 viral load kinetics and duration of viral shedding in asymptomatic people across studies have been heterogenous. In a systematic review assessing viral load kinetics and duration of viral shedding among asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers, only two of 12 included studies reported lower viral loads in asymptomatic people than symptomatic people. Four studies reported that initial viral loads among asymptomatic and symptomatic people were similar, although one of these reported significantly lower viral load among asymptomatic people during follow-up. Faster viral clearance in asymptomatic people than symptomatic people was reported in five studies, but one study reported a longer duration of viral shedding in asymptomatic people.

### Relating in vivo respiratory syncytial virus infection kinetics to host infectiousness in different age groups [^112i4utt]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections are a major public health concern for pediatric populations and older adults. Viral kinetics, the dynamic processes of viral infection within an individual over time, vary across different populations. However, RSV transmission in different age groups is incompletely understood from the perspective of individual-level viral kinetics. Using a mathematical model and a hierarchical Bayesian framework, we analyzed viral kinetics in 53 individuals from different age groups to estimate infection parameters and linked within-host viral load to transmission probability through a probabilistic model. We found that children had higher peak viral loads and longer shedding periods compared to other age groups, suggesting a higher transmission probability over the infectious period. We validated our findings by comparing the estimated secondary attack rate across different age groups to empirical estimates from household transmission studies. Our work highlights the importance of age-specific considerations in understanding and managing RSV infections.

### Understanding of COVID-19 based on current evidence [^113S6AkL]. Journal of Medical Virology (2020). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on COVID-19 infection:

- Definition: COVID-19 is a severe acute respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2, a positive sense, single-strand enveloped RNA virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae.
- Pathophysiology: Person-to-person transmission primarily occurs through droplets generated during coughing and sneezing. Droplets can be transmitted directly through close contact, or via contaminated surfaces, where the virus may remain active for hours to days. Coughing and some airway management procedures can generate aerosols containing suspended viral particles, which can travel greater distances and be inhaled.
- Epidemiology: The inaugural COVID-19 outbreak was labelled a pandemic by the WHO on March 11, 2020.
- Disease course: The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be wide, encompassing asymptomatic infection, mild upper respiratory tract illness, and severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure. Cardiomyopathy has been described in a significant proportion of critically ill patients. Anosmia has been reported in association with presumed neuroinvasive disease.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: Mortality remains high in patients requiring intensive care.

### Harnessing peak transmission around symptom onset for non-pharmaceutical intervention and containment of the COVID-19 pandemic [^111LpiqQ]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new contagious disease caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2), which belongs to the genera of betacoronavirus, the same as the coronavirus that caused the SARS epidemic between 2002 and 2003. COVID-19 has spread to more than 200 countries/regions, with over 102 million confirmed cases and 2.2 million lives claimed as of January 31, 2021. The outbreak has been declared a pandemic and a public health emergency of international concern.

As the specific symptoms of COVID-19 are now well-publicised, symptomatic transmissions are being contained in most countries. However, disease transmission by pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic viral carriers is seen to be extremely difficult to deal with due to its hidden nature. Clinical data reveals that viral load becomes significant before the symptom onset –. Epidemiological investigations have identified clear cases of pre-symptomatic transmission soon after the initial outbreak –. Estimates vary greatly among experts on the percentage of total transmission due to this group of viral carriers, ranging from as low as 18% to over 50% –. An early model-based study by Ferretti et al.suggested that pre-symptomatic transmission alone could yield a basic reproduction number R 0, p = 0.9, close to the critical value of 1.0 that sustains epidemic growth. Under intense surveillance of the pandemic, pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmissions become the main focus in outbreak control.

While the actual viral shedding is influenced by many factors, patient viral load during the course of disease progression is more universal. This suggests a modelling approach that starts with clinical observations of symptom onset, and treats disease transmission as a dependent process that is further shaped by living and social conditions, including control measures to reduce physical contact. Following this strategy, we first introduce a model for an unprotected population and calibrate the model parameters against clinical case reports during the initial outbreak. Subsequently, we estimate the percentage reduction in the basic reproduction number (estimated to be around 3.87 at an exponential growth rate of 0.3/day) due to contact tracing, mask wearing and other measures, individually or in combination. Additionally, we present our findings against the epidemic development curves around the world to highlight the level of social mobilisation required to contain COVID-19 spreading.
