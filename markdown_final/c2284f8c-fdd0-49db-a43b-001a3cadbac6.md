## Question

Should PSA level be checked in a patient aged 30–40 On testosterone therapy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a man aged 30–40 years on testosterone therapy should have PSA checked, and if so, how to monitor it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what major guidelines say about baseline PSA testing before testosterone therapy by age. Then, I should verify whether any guidance recommends on-treatment PSA monitoring in men under 40. Next, I will consider the biological rationale for PSA changes with testosterone and whether that changes the calculus in younger men. After that, I should review exceptions, such as high-risk features or prior prostate cancer. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant recommendation and monitoring plan, including thresholds for action and documentation needs.

> Let me first confirm the baseline testing guidance by age. The AUA guideline states that PSA should be measured in men over 40 years of age prior to initiating testosterone therapy to exclude occult prostate cancer, which implies that routine baseline PSA is not recommended for men under 40 in the absence of specific risk factors [^115GXqPj]. The Endocrine Society guideline similarly emphasizes prostate risk assessment and monitoring primarily for men 55–69 years, with earlier consideration at age 40 for high-risk men, and explicitly notes that men under 40 do not need prostate monitoring, which aligns with the notion that routine baseline PSA is not indicated in the 30–40 age group [^111qnJmQ]. The EAA guideline recommends discussing and considering PSA/DRE before therapy in patients older than 40, again underscoring that under 40 is not a routine target for baseline prostate evaluation unless risk is elevated [^116YDLng].

> Wait, let me verify whether any on-treatment monitoring is advised for men 30–40. The Endocrine Society's monitoring schedule focuses on symptom review, testosterone level, and hematocrit at 3–6 months, 12 months, and annually thereafter; prostate monitoring with PSA/DRE is suggested only for those who choose monitoring, which in practice is targeted to older men or those at higher risk, not to men under 40 as a routine [^116F2R6D]. The AUA's follow-up framework likewise directs PSA monitoring to be guided by general population screening principles and shared decision-making, which do not endorse routine PSA testing in men under 40, reinforcing that on-treatment PSA checks are not standard for ages 30–40 without specific risk factors [^116zRHbs]. I should double-check: none of these guidelines recommend scheduled PSA testing during testosterone therapy for men under 40 in average-risk scenarios, which supports a conservative, individualized approach rather than routine screening in this age band [^111qnJmQ] [^116zRHbs].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to consider the biological rationale. Testosterone therapy can modestly increase PSA on average by about 0.3–0.5 ng/mL, with larger increases seen in older men, and the clinical concern is that a PSA rise could unmask subclinical disease or prompt unnecessary biopsies, particularly in older populations where background risk and occult cancer prevalence are higher [^113j9dCc] [^111JPNZ8]. But wait, what if the patient is very young? In men aged 30–40, baseline PSA is typically low and prostate cancer prevalence is extremely low, so the yield and positive predictive value of routine PSA testing are minimal, which further weakens the case for routine baseline or on-treatment PSA checks in this age group unless risk is elevated [^111qnJmQ].

> I should confirm the exceptions where PSA assessment becomes relevant even under 40. If the patient has a strong family history (e.g., first-degree relative with prostate cancer), is of African ancestry, has suspicious lower urinary tract symptoms, an abnormal digital rectal examination, or a concerning PSA discovered incidentally, then prostate evaluation should proceed irrespective of age, because baseline risk is no longer average [^111qnJmQ] [^115GXqPj]. Let me reconsider: even in men under 40, an unevaluated prostate nodule or induration, or a markedly elevated PSA, should prompt urologic assessment before or instead of testosterone therapy, consistent with contraindication-type guidance in major guidelines [^113SH3fG] [^111EwMYk].

> Next, I should review what to do if, despite being under 40, PSA is checked and is abnormal. I need to ensure we follow confirmation steps: repeat the PSA to exclude transient elevation, review medications that can lower PSA (e.g., 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors), and interpret values in light of age-adjusted norms and risk calculators before proceeding to biopsy or advanced imaging, aligning with general PSA screening principles and urologic referral thresholds used in older men [^114hmhTx] [^113JLyiw]. Hold on, I should verify the thresholds: a confirmed PSA greater than 4.0 ng/mL is a widely accepted trigger for urologic evaluation, and during the first year of testosterone therapy, a confirmed rise greater than 1.4 ng/mL above baseline is also used to prompt referral, though these thresholds are derived from older populations and should be contextualized in younger men with very low baselines [^113JLyiw] [^1162mjrC].

> I will now examine the practical monitoring plan for a 30–40-year-old on testosterone therapy. Baseline assessment should include history, exam, and standard labs such as total testosterone and hematocrit. Routine PSA is not required in average-risk men under 40, but clinicians should remain vigilant for urinary symptoms or exam abnormalities that would change management [^116F2R6D] [^115GXqPj]. On-treatment, follow testosterone and hematocrit at 3–6 months, 12 months, and annually, assess symptoms and adverse effects at each visit, and add PSA/DRE only if risk factors emerge, symptoms arise, or the patient specifically requests shared decision-making about screening after counseling on potential harms and low yield in this age group [^116F2R6D] [^116zRHbs]. Let me first confirm that this approach matches both safety monitoring and shared decision-making principles emphasized by the guidelines, which it does [^116B6gbs] [^114VZDBG].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on therapy and asks why PSA wasn't checked at baseline? I should explain that current evidence and guidelines indicate no proven benefit to routine PSA screening in asymptomatic men under 40, and that testosterone therapy has not been shown to increase the incidence of prostate cancer, though it can modestly increase PSA and thereby potentially increase biopsy rates without clear mortality benefit in younger men, reinforcing the rationale for individualized rather than routine testing in this age band [^1112nefC] [^113j9dCc] [^111qnJmQ]. I need to ensure the patient understands that if new risk factors or symptoms develop, we would promptly reassess and, if indicated, obtain PSA and urologic evaluation under the same shared decision-making framework used for older men [^116zRHbs].

> Final synthesis: For a man aged 30–40 on testosterone therapy, routine PSA testing is not recommended in the absence of specific risk factors or symptoms. Baseline PSA before therapy is not required solely based on age, and on-treatment PSA monitoring is not part of standard care in this age group. PSA should be obtained if the patient has high-risk features, develops urinary or rectal symptoms, has an abnormal DRE, or requests screening after informed discussion. If PSA is checked and is elevated, follow confirmation protocols and age-appropriate referral thresholds, recognizing that very low baseline PSAs in younger men mean that even modest absolute increases can represent large relative changes and may warrant cautious interpretation and urologic input [^115GXqPj] [^111qnJmQ] [^113JLyiw].

---

Routine PSA testing is **not recommended** for men aged 30–40 on testosterone therapy unless they have specific risk factors (family history, African ancestry, or suspicious symptoms) [^111qnJmQ]. If PSA is checked, interpret results cautiously: a modest rise (≤ 0.5 ng/mL) is expected with therapy [^113j9dCc], but a rapid increase (> 1.4 ng/mL/year) or a value > 4 ng/mL warrants urologic evaluation [^113JLyiw]. Use shared decision-making to discuss benefits and harms, and document patient preferences [^116zRHbs].

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from the American Urological Association (AUA) and the Endocrine Society provide clear guidance on PSA testing in younger men on testosterone therapy:

- **AUA guidelines**: PSA should be measured in men over 40 years of age before initiating testosterone therapy to exclude occult prostate cancer [^115GXqPj]. For men under 40, routine PSA testing is not recommended unless there are specific risk factors or clinical suspicions [^111qnJmQ].

- **Endocrine Society guidelines**: Men under 40 years of age do not need routine prostate monitoring, including PSA testing, unless they have specific risk factors such as a family history of prostate cancer or African ancestry [^111qnJmQ].

- **Shared decision-making**: Both guidelines emphasize the importance of shared decision-making, discussing the potential benefits and risks of PSA testing with patients, and documenting patient preferences [^116zRHbs].

---

## Risks and benefits of PSA testing in younger men on testosterone therapy

### Potential benefits

Potential benefits include **early detection** — rare prostate cancer cases may be identified in men aged 30–40, particularly with risk factors — and **baseline establishment**, whereby establishing a baseline PSA before therapy can help interpret future changes.

---

### Potential risks

Potential risks include **false positives**, which may lead to unnecessary anxiety, invasive procedures, and overtreatment; **limited evidence** — the incidence of prostate cancer is low in this age group, so routine PSA testing may not significantly alter outcomes; and **psychological burden**, as false positives and unnecessary procedures can cause significant anxiety and stress.

---

## Evidence on PSA changes with testosterone therapy

Testosterone therapy can cause modest increases in **PSA levels**, typically around 0.3 ng/mL in younger men [^113j9dCc]. These increases are usually within the normal range and do not necessarily indicate **prostate cancer**. However, **rapid increases (> 1.4 ng/mL/year) or absolute values > 4 ng/mL** should prompt further evaluation [^113JLyiw].

---

## Clinical scenarios warranting PSA testing in younger men

While routine PSA testing is not recommended for men aged 30–40, certain clinical scenarios may warrant testing:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Family history of prostate cancer | Increased risk of prostate cancer |
| African ancestry | Higher incidence of prostate cancer |
| Suspicious symptoms (e.g. urinary symptoms, hematospermia) | Clinical suspicion of prostate pathology |
| Abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE) | Clinical suspicion of prostate pathology |

---

## Recommended approach to PSA testing in younger men on testosterone therapy

Given the limited evidence and potential risks, the following approach is recommended:

- **Baseline assessment**: Conduct a thorough clinical assessment, including family history, ethnicity, and symptom review, before initiating testosterone therapy [^111qnJmQ].

- **Shared decision-making**: Discuss the potential benefits and risks of PSA testing with the patient, emphasizing the low incidence of prostate cancer in this age group and the potential for false positives [^116zRHbs].

- **Selective testing**: Consider PSA testing only in patients with specific risk factors or clinical suspicions, as outlined above [^111qnJmQ].

- **Monitoring**: If PSA testing is performed, monitor for modest increases consistent with testosterone therapy. Rapid increases or absolute values > 4 ng/mL should prompt further evaluation [^113JLyiw].

- **Documentation**: Clearly document patient preferences and the rationale for testing or not testing PSA levels [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Routine PSA testing is **not recommended** for men aged 30–40 on testosterone therapy unless specific risk factors or clinical suspicions are present. Clinicians should use shared decision-making to discuss the potential benefits and risks of PSA testing, consider selective testing in higher-risk patients, and monitor for modest PSA increases consistent with testosterone therapy. Rapid increases or absolute values > 4 ng/mL should prompt further evaluation [^113JLyiw].

### Clinical practice update on testosterone therapy for male hypogonadism: contrasting perspectives to optimize care [^111WJUkJ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Medium credibility.

US Endocrine Society (ES) published a clinical practice guideline on testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism, and Endocrine Society of Australia (ESA) a position statement on management of male hypogonadism. Both emphasize the importance of diagnosing men who are androgen deficient due to organic (classical or pathological) hypogonadism arising from disorders of the hypothalamus, pituitary or testes, who assuredly benefit from testosterone therapy. Both recognize that men with an intact gonadal axis may have low testosterone concentrations, for instance older men or men with obesity or other medical comorbidities. ES guidelines classify such symptomatic men as having organic (advanced age) or functional (obesity, medical comorbidities) hypogonadism, giving an option for testosterone therapy as a shared decision between clinicians and individual patients. ESA did not recommend testosterone therapy in these men. ES offers a reference range for total testosterone established in young men, while ESA cites age-standardized reference ranges. ES recommends using free testosterone as well as total testosterone to identify men with hypogonadism in conditions where sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) is altered, or when total testosterone is borderline. ESA recommends confirmatory biochemical testing with total testosterone, recognizing that this may be lower than expected if SHBG concentrations are low. Both emphasize the importance of identifying pre-existing prostate and cardiovascular disease prior to initiating testosterone therapy, with ES providing specific recommendations for PSA measurement, deferring testosterone therapy after major cardiovascular events and indications for pituitary imaging. These contrasting approaches highlight gaps in the evidence base where individualized patient management is required.

### Testosterone and prostate cancer: what are the risks for middle-aged men? [^117TydpZ]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

With increased recognition of the benefits of testosterone (T) therapy for middle-aged men, there has been a concomitant reexamination of the historical fear that raising T will result in more prostate cancer (PCa). Studies have failed to show increased risk of PCa in men with higher serum T, and supraphysiologic T fails to increase prostate volume or prostate-specific antigen in healthy men. This apparent paradox is explained by the Saturation Model, which posits a finite capacity of androgen to stimulate PCa growth. Modern studies indicate no increased risk of PCa among men with serum T in the therapeutic range.

### Mortality risk for docetaxel-treated, high-grade prostate cancer with low PSA levels: a meta-analysis [^116BuvPy]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is the addition of docetaxel to standard of care (SOC) therapy with radiation and testosterone suppression or radical prostatectomy associated with decreased risk of prostate cancer–specific and all-cause deaths in patients with high-grade, nonmetastatic prostate cancer with low prostate-specific antigen levels?

Findings

In this meta-analysis of 4 randomized clinical trials (145 participants with prostate cancer), adding docetaxel to SOC treatment in patients who were in otherwise good health was associated with a significant reduction in death due to prostate cancer.

Meaning

The poor prognosis of patients with high-grade prostate cancer and low levels of prostate-specific antigen levels may be improved with the addition of docetaxel to SOC treatment.

### Monitoring of testosterone replacement therapy to optimize the benefit-to-risk ratio [^114VZDBG]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

For hypogonadal men treated with testosterone, the goal is to ensure that benefits are optimized, risks are minimized, and any adverse effects are identified early and managed appropriately. This can best be achieved by careful patient selection, excluding men with contraindications and addressing any modifiable risk factors in those at increased risk. A standardized plan should be used for monitoring that includes evaluation of symptoms, side effects, adherence, and measurement of testosterone and hematocrit. Shared decision making should be used to determine whether to screen for prostate cancer and informed by age, baseline cancer risk, and patient preference.

### Androgen-targeted therapy in men with prostate cancer: evolving practice and future considerations [^116NSQkc]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Recommendation for routine testosterone testing

T levels should be measured regularly in men receiving ADT to ensure T suppression is being maintained to target; this does not appear to be the case in routine clinical practice. EAU guidelines recommend that T testing is performed 3 months after the first dose of ADT and repeated every 3−6 months thereafter. ADT use is often assumed to be a proxy for adequate T suppression to castrate levels; however, neglecting to assess T will fail to identify levels above target, microsurges, and escapes. Adding a T test to the regular PSA assessment is simple to implement and would address these concerns.

With a rise in PSA and progression to CRPC, T testing and management remain important. Confirmation that T is castrate at time of CRPC diagnosis is critical, and continuance of regular testing should confirm effective T suppression and prevention of repopulation of partially androgen-sensitive tumor cells. An incorrect diagnosis of CRPC may prompt the use of additional, more costly, and possibly more toxic therapies in patients who do not yet require them.

The most widely used assay for T determinations is the chemiluminescent immunoassay which is reliable at the higher levels of T typically measured in men being evaluated for androgen deficiency or infertility (i.e. > 50 ng/dL), but may not be accurate at the very low levels seen in men on ADT (< 20 ng/dL). Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) is the most sensitive test available for detecting low levels of T, although it is more costly and labor intensive. Clinicians should be encouraged to communicate with their laboratory colleagues to ensure that T assays conducted while monitoring patients undergoing ADT have an appropriate lower limit of quantification, ideally LC-MS/MS or an immunoassay that has been validated to detect low levels of T. Additionally, consistent use of the same laboratory and the same assay for all T measurements from a patient would provide the highest level of comparability of patient lab values over the course of treatment.

### Clinical review: why is androgen replacement in males controversial? [^11757dfP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Context

Symptoms and signs consistent with androgen deficiency and low testosterone levels are recognized frequently in clinical practice. Recent population-based epidemiological studies indicate that low testosterone levels in men are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The clinician must be able to counsel patients to help them determine whether testosterone replacement therapy is appropriate for them.

Evidence Acquisition

The authors have conducted a literature search in PubMed, and we have reviewed references in the multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses that have been published on this topic.

Evidence Synthesis

We have attempted to provide the reader with an appreciation of the evidence that can be used to support the diagnosis of androgen deficiency, the efficacy of treatment, the potential risks of treatment, the therapeutic options, and the recommendations for monitoring treatment.

Conclusions

We think that published clinical experience justifies testosterone replacement therapy in males who have not initiated puberty by age 14 and in males with low testosterone levels due to classical diseases of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. The benefit:risk ratio is less certain in older men and in those with chronic diseases associated with low testosterone levels. The decision to treat in this setting is much more controversial because there are few large clinical trials that have demonstrated efficacy and no large clinical trials that have determined potential risks of increasing the incidence of clinical prostate cancers or cardiovascular events. We provide a critical review of the evidence that supports treatment and potential risks and ways to reduce the risks if the physician and patient elect testosterone replacement.

### Adult-onset hypogonadism [^113SbDPc]. Mayo Clinic Proceedings (2016). Medium credibility.

Adult-onset hypogonadism (AOH) — treatment and follow-up for men administered testosterone therapy (TT) includes branching by fertility goals and specified monitoring. For those with a desire to maintain fertility, stimulation of endogenous testosterone secretion (if luteinizing hormone is not elevated) with selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM) or human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is outlined; for those with no desire to maintain fertility, testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) follows discussion of risks/benefits of various formulations. Follow-up at 3 and 6 months, then annually assesses signs/symptoms, weight, total testosterone (TT), hematocrit (Hct), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA); at 6 months, if total T < 400 ng/dL and no improvement, then consider dose increase with reassessment in another 3–6 months. If hematocrit > 54%, then stop TRT until Hct decreases to a safe level, evaluate for hypoxia and sleep apnea, and reinstate TRT at a reduced dose. Bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine and/or femoral neck is measured after 1–2 years of TRT in men with osteoporosis or low trauma fracture. In men aged ≥ 40 years with baseline PSA > 0.6 ng/mL, perform digital rectal examination (DRE) and check PSA before TRT, at 3 to 6 months, and then based on prostate cancer screening guidelines. Evaluate formulation-specific adverse events at each follow-up visit, and if not improved after 3–6 months, consider discontinuation and search for other causes/treatments.

### Testosterone therapy in adult men with androgen deficiency syndromes: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113EYWFv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective was to provide guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of androgen deficiency syndromes in adult men.

Participants

The Task Force was composed of a chair, selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of The Endocrine Society, five additional experts, a methodologist, and a professional writer. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Evidence

The Task Force used systematic reviews of available evidence to inform its key recommendations. The Task Force used consistent language and graphical descriptions of both the strength of recommendation and the quality of evidence, using the recommendations of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation group.

Consensus Process

Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence and discussions during three group meetings, several conference calls, and e-mail communications. The drafts prepared by the panelists with the help of a professional writer were reviewed successively by The Endocrine Society's Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee, Clinical Affairs Committee, and Council. The version approved by the Council was placed on The Endocrine Society's web site for comments by members. At each stage of review, the Task Force received written comments and incorporated needed changes.

Conclusions

We recommend making a diagnosis of androgen deficiency only in men with consistent symptoms and signs and unequivocally low serum testosterone levels. We suggest the measurement of morning total testosterone level by a reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test. We recommend confirmation of the diagnosis by repeating the measurement of morning total testosterone and in some patients by measurement of free or bioavailable testosterone level, using accurate assays. We recommend testosterone therapy for symptomatic men with androgen deficiency, who have low testosterone levels, to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics and to improve their sexual function, sense of well-being, muscle mass and strength, and bone mineral density. We recommend against starting testosterone therapy in patients with breast or prostate cancer, a palpable prostate nodule or induration or prostate-specific antigen greater than 3 ng/ml without further urological evaluation, erythrocytosis (hematocrit > 50%), hyperviscosity, untreated obstructive sleep apnea, severe lower urinary tract symptoms with International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) greater than 19, or class III or IV heart failure. When testosterone therapy is instituted, we suggest aiming at achieving testosterone levels during treatment in the mid-normal range with any of the approved formulations, chosen on the basis of the patient's preference, consideration of pharmacokinetics, treatment burden, and cost. Men receiving testosterone therapy should be monitored using a standardized plan.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^116p4z6a]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Prostate health

Testosterone therapy increases serum prostate specific antigen concentrations in hypogonadal men to that of age-matched controls. Although there is no evidence that testosterone treatment increases the risk of de novo prostate cancer, clinical trials have not had enough participants or long enough follow-up to be conclusive. Testosterone stimulates metastatic and high-grade prostate cancer, but it is not known whether testosterone treatment stimulates the growth of pre-existing subclinical lower grade prostate cancer. Testosterone treatment has not been shown to have a significant effect on lower urinary tract symptoms; however, clinical trials have generally excluded men with severe benign prostatic hypertrophy. Testosterone should generally not be prescribed for men with prostate cancer (with possible exceptions in carefully selected men such as those with a history of treated low-risk, Gleason < 3 + 4 prostate cancer, undetectable PSA and no clinical evidence of disease after treatment) or to men at higher risk of prostate cancer (unevaluated prostate nodule, PSA > 4 ng/mL), and follow-up of prostate health during testosterone treatment should be individualized. Individualized prostate cancer screening should be offered with a nuanced discussion of the potential benefits (possible early detection of prostate cancer that might improve mortality and decrease the risk of metastatic disease) and the potential harm of increased prostate biopsies and prostate cancer therapies that may cause erectile dysfunction and incontinence and might not always improve long-term, health-related quality of life.

### Role of testosterone in managing advanced prostate cancer [^115empwh]. Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Androgen deprivation therapy is frequently used to treat patients with advanced prostate cancer. New therapies for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer have drawn increased attention to serum and intratumoral testosterone levels. The present review examines the role of testosterone in prostate cancer progression, discusses the nuances and potential pitfalls in measuring serum testosterone using available assays, and summarizes current data relevant to the arguments for and against achieving and maintaining the lowest possible testosterone levels during androgen deprivation therapy, including the adverse effects of such treatment. Incorporating this information, we have made recommendations incorporating testosterone evaluation and its effect on the clinical decision-making process.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^11798Y7c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the "Testosterone Therapy in Men With Androgen Deficiency Syndromes" guideline published in 2010.

Participants

The participants include an Endocrine Society-appointed task force of 10 medical content experts and a clinical practice guideline methodologist.

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to describe the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. The task force commissioned two systematic reviews and used the best available evidence from other published systematic reviews and individual studies.

Consensus Process

One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications facilitated consensus development. Endocrine Society committees and members and the cosponsoring organization were invited to review and comment on preliminary drafts of the guideline.

Conclusions

We recommend making a diagnosis of hypogonadism only in men with symptoms and signs consistent with testosterone (T) deficiency and unequivocally and consistently low serum T concentrations. We recommend measuring fasting morning total T concentrations using an accurate and reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test. We recommend confirming the diagnosis by repeating the measurement of morning fasting total T concentrations. In men whose total T is near the lower limit of normal or who have a condition that alters sex hormone-binding globulin, we recommend obtaining a free T concentration using either equilibrium dialysis or estimating it using an accurate formula. In men determined to have androgen deficiency, we recommend additional diagnostic evaluation to ascertain the cause of androgen deficiency. We recommend T therapy for men with symptomatic T deficiency to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics and correct symptoms of hypogonadism after discussing the potential benefits and risks of therapy and of monitoring therapy and involving the patient in decision making. We recommend against starting T therapy in patients who are planning fertility in the near term or have any of the following conditions: breast or prostate cancer, a palpable prostate nodule or induration, prostate-specific antigen level > 4 ng/mL, prostate-specific antigen > 3 ng/mL in men at increased risk of prostate cancer (e.g. African Americans and men with a first-degree relative with diagnosed prostate cancer) without further urological evaluation, elevated hematocrit, untreated severe obstructive sleep apnea, severe lower urinary tract symptoms, uncontrolled heart failure, myocardial infarction or stroke within the last 6 months, or thrombophilia. We suggest that when clinicians institute T therapy, they aim at achieving T concentrations in the mid-normal range during treatment with any of the approved formulations, taking into consideration patient preference, pharmacokinetics, formulation-specific adverse effects, treatment burden, and cost. Clinicians should monitor men receiving T therapy using a standardized plan that includes: evaluating symptoms, adverse effects, and compliance; measuring serum T and hematocrit concentrations; and evaluating prostate cancer risk during the first year after initiating T therapy.

Testosterone therapy and prostate cancer — evidence summary and core recommendation: The relationship between testosterone (T) administration and prostate cancer risk remains poorly understood and no RCT has been long or large enough to determine whether T increases risk; epidemiologic studies report no significant association between endogenous T concentrations and prostate cancer risk. Because androgen receptor signaling is central in prostate cancer biology and T administration promotes growth of metastatic prostate cancer, the guideline states, we recommend against T supplementation in men with prostate cancer and suggest assessing prostate cancer risk prior to treatment initiation.

Many of the symptoms attributed to male hypogonadism are commonly seen in normal male aging or in the presence of comorbid conditions. Testosterone therapy has the potential for serious side effects and represents a significant expense. It is therefore important to confirm the clinical suspicion of hypogonadism with biochemical testing. Current guidelines recommend the use of a total testosterone level obtained in the morning. A low level should be confirmed on a different day, again measuring the total testosterone. In some situations, a free or bioavailable testosterone may be of additional value.

Radiation therapy recurrence — monitoring and management: Monitoring should include physical exam, PSA every 3–6 mo, and imaging for symptoms or increasing PSA. Document castrate levels of testosterone if clinically indicated, and workup for progression should include bone and soft tissue evaluation. Treatment for patients with life expectancy < 5 y whose cancer progressed on observation of localized disease is ADT. For patients with PSA progression who have not received treatment for a first BCR, continue monitoring or consider treatment for first PSA persistence/recurrence. PSADT can be calculated to inform nomogram use and counseling, and PSADT and Grade Group should be considered when deciding whether to begin ADT. Treatment for first biochemical recurrence has historically been referred to as "salvage" therapy; the guidelines refer to this setting as "secondary" therapy.

Objective

Our objective was to update the guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of androgen deficiency syndromes in adult men published previously in 2006.

Participants

The Task Force was composed of a chair, selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of The Endocrine Society, five additional experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Conclusions

We recommend making a diagnosis of androgen deficiency only in men with consistent symptoms and signs and unequivocally low serum testosterone levels. We suggest the measurement of morning total testosterone level by a reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test. We recommend confirmation of the diagnosis by repeating the measurement of morning total testosterone and, in some men in whom total testosterone is near the lower limit of normal or in whom SHBG abnormality is suspected by measurement of free or bioavailable testosterone level, using validated assays. We recommend testosterone therapy for men with symptomatic androgen deficiency to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics and to improve their sexual function, sense of well-being, muscle mass and strength, and bone mineral density. We recommend against starting testosterone therapy in patients with breast or prostate cancer, a palpable prostate nodule or induration or prostate-specific antigen greater than 4 ng/ml or greater than 3 ng/ml in men at high risk for prostate cancer such as African-Americans or men with first-degree relatives with prostate cancer without further urological evaluation, hematocrit greater than 50%, untreated severe obstructive sleep apnea, severe lower urinary tract symptoms with International Prostate Symptom Score above 19, or uncontrolled or poorly controlled heart failure. When testosterone therapy is instituted, we suggest aiming at achieving testosterone levels during treatment in the mid-normal range with any of the approved formulations, chosen on the basis of the patient's preference, consideration of pharmacokinetics, treatment burden, and cost. Men receiving testosterone therapy should be monitored using a standardized plan.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1132JUcG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Testosterone therapy — prostate cancer detection, biopsy harms, and screening yield: Testosterone therapy increases detection of subclinical prostate cancer via increased surveillance and PSA rise, and a meta-analysis found a greater proportion of men randomized to T had prostate biopsies than those assigned to placebo. Prostate biopsy may cause pain, fever, bleeding, infection, transient urinary difficulties, psychological harms, and overdiagnosis, and prostate cancer treatment can result in erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, bowel dysfunction, and a small risk of premature death. In long-term screening follow-up, PSA-based screening prevents one to two men from dying of prostate cancer for every 1000 men screened, and screening 1000 men 55 to 69 years of age may prevent approximately three men from developing metastatic prostate cancer; therefore, it is important to establish standardized monitoring and referral criteria during T treatment to minimize unnecessary testing.

### Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test-NCI-national cancer institute… [^114hmhTx]. NCI (2024). Medium credibility.

The PSA test measures the level of PSA in the blood. This test is used in several different ways:

- to monitor the progression of prostate cancer in men who have already been diagnosed with the disease
- to follow up on prostate symptoms, such as painful or frequent urination, blood in urine or semen, and pelvic and/or back pain
- to screen for prostate cancer in men who do not have symptoms of the disease. The current recommendation of the United States Preventive Serves Task Force, which applies both to the general population and to those at increased risk due to race/ethnicity or family history, is as follows:

- For individuals aged 55 to 69 years, the decision to undergo periodic PSA-based screening for prostate cancer should be an individual one. Before making the decision, a person should discuss the potential benefits and harms of screening with their clinician and consider these in the context of their own values and preferences.
- PSA-based screening for prostate cancer is not recommended for individuals 70 years and older. In general, a PSA level above 4. 0 ng/mL is considered abnormal and may result in a recommendation for prostate biopsy. However, because PSA levels increase with age, some doctors apply a higher cutoff for older men and a lower cutoff for younger men. In addition, a lower cutoff for abnormal is used in men taking certain drugs, including finasteride and dutasteride, which are used to treat BPH. These drugs lower the PSA level. What is done if a screening test shows an elevated PSA level. If someone who has no symptoms of prostate cancer chooses to undergo prostate cancer screening and is found to have an abnormal PSA level, the doctor may recommend another PSA test in 6 to 8 weeks to confirm the original finding.

If the PSA level is still elevated, the doctor may recommend continued observation with repeat PSA tests along with digital rectal exams to watch for any changes over time. However, a single elevated PSA measurement in someone who has a history of prostate cancer does not always mean that the cancer has come back. Someone who has been treated for prostate cancer should discuss an elevated PSA level with their doctor. The doctor may recommend repeating the PSA test or performing other tests to check for evidence of a recurrence. The doctor may look for a trend of rising PSA level over time rather than a single elevated PSA level.

### Prostate safety events during testosterone replacement therapy in men with hypogonadism: a randomized clinical trial [^1162zUcE]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Prostate Safety Monitoring Plan

The prespecified prostate safety monitoring plan is provided in Supplement 1. The PSA levels were measured at baseline, 3 months, 12 months, and annually thereafter, and IPSS was assessed at baseline, 3 months, 12 months, 36 months, and the end of the study. Digital prostate examinations were performed at baseline, 12 months, 36 months, and end of study. At each visit, participants were asked structured questions about LUTS and prostate procedures. If a prostate procedure was reported, an attempt was made to obtain pathology reports and tissue.

To minimize the ascertainment bias attributable to the increased risk of being referred for a prostate biopsy because of testosterone-induced increase in PSA levels, the criteria for urologic referral were prespecified. The participants were referred for urologic evaluation and possible biopsy if they had any of the following: (1) confirmed PSA increase more than 1.4 ng/mL above baseline in the first year of treatment (or > 0.7 ng/mL in 5ARI-treated men); (2) confirmed PSA concentration greater than 4.0 ng/mL at any time (> 2.0 ng/mL in 5ARI-treated men); (3) for men aged 45 to 54 years with a baseline PSA concentration less than 1.5 ng/mL, a PSA level increasing to 3.0 ng/mL at any time (< 0.75 ng/mL increasing to 1.5 ng/mL for 5ARI-treated men); or (4) prostate nodule or induration at any time. For criteria 1, 2, and 3, elevations in PSA concentrations were confirmed by repeating the test. For the men who met these criteria, prostate cancer risk was estimated using the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial Risk Calculator, version 2.0 (UT Health San Antonio), and participants were provided an institutional review board–approved video that described the potential benefits and risks of prostate biopsyto facilitate informed decision-making regarding prostate biopsy.

Prostate Safety End Points

The primary prostate safety end point was the incidence of high-grade prostate cancer (Gleason score 4 + 3 or higher). Secondary end points included the incidence of any prostate cancer, acute urinary retention, invasive prostate surgical procedure for BPH, prostate biopsy, and new pharmacologic treatment for LUTSs. The LUTSs were evaluated using the IPSS. Changes in PSA concentrations from baseline and from month 12 were determined.

In hypogonadal men being considered for testosterone therapy who are 40 to 69 years old and at increased risk of prostate cancer, we suggest discussing prostate cancer risk with the patient and offering monitoring options, and we suggest that clinicians offer evaluation of prostate cancer risk beginning at age 40 in high-risk men; in patients who agree to monitoring, clinicians should evaluate PSA levels and perform a digital prostate examination at baseline and at 3 to 12 months after starting testosterone treatment, and after 1 year of testosterone-replacement therapy, we suggest clinicians follow guidelines for prostate cancer screening based on the age and race of the patient.

Case 3

A 70-year-old trans woman who had been on feminizing hormone therapy for 6 months had a PSA performed as part of a routine health check. She was taking transdermal estradiol 100mcg/24hr patches twice weekly and cyproterone acetate 12.5mg daily. Her total testosterone was 1.5 nmol/L (43 ng/dl) and PSA was 2 ng/mL. She had mild lower urinary tract symptoms with reduced urinary flow over a number of years but had no family history of prostate cancer. How should she be managed?

Prostate-specific antigen

There are no studies examining the effect of feminizing hormone therapy on PSA. It is known that androgen deprivation as part of feminizing hormone therapy is associated with a substantially lower risk for prostate cancer than the general male population. All published case reports of prostate cancer in trans people using feminizing hormone therapy have had histology showing high risk adenocarcinoma with PSA concentrations at diagnosis ranging from 5 to 1722 ng/mL (ng/mL equivalent to ug/L). Physiologically, in the setting of androgen deprivation in people with a prostate gland, it would be expected that PSA should be lower than the age-specific reference interval. There is insufficient data to recommend a specific cutoff for trans people using feminizing hormone therapy. Individualized decisions based upon clinical history and examination should inform need for serial monitoring for PSA velocity or imaging.

Case 3 had a digital rectal examination which showed a smooth but mildly enlarged prostate gland. She had an ultrasound of her prostate which showed a mildly enlarged prostate volume of 35 mL. Repeat PSA monitoring revealed progressive lowering of her PSA concentration with ongoing feminizing hormone therapy and an improvement in her urinary flow.

The widely accepted absolute contraindication for administration of testosterone in hypogonadal men with prostate cancer has been questioned. Although recommendations from some professional associations still adhere to the traditional concepts, there is increasing relaxation of such positions. Currently, the evidence for definitive guidelines is unavailable and the clinician has to rely on incomplete but best attainable information. Under certain circumstances (successfully treated prostate cancer or active surveillance for low risk disease), testosterone administration is warranted. For those with intermediate or high-risk cancer, extreme caution seems advisable. The benefits must heavily outweigh the hazards. Ideally, these men should participate in clinical trials and registries. Competent initial assessment of individual circumstances and follow-up are mandatory.

definition of castration resistance

Over time, castration resistance has been defined in multiple ways, and with the approval of novel agents for the treatment of CRPC it is important to clarify the definition.

There was clear consensus (94% of the panel) that testosterone levels need to be measured and a specific value is required to designate a patient castration-resistant. As a consensus, 82% of the panel recommended a testosterone level < 50 ng/dl (< 1.7 nmol/l) as an appropriate cut-off value in daily clinical practice, which is in line with the US FDA definition.

Again there was clear consensus (94% of the panel) that a confirmed (by a second value three or more weeks later) rising PSA on ADT in the presence of suppressed testosterone is sufficient for the characterisation of a castration-resistant state in clinical practice.

In case of a rising PSA on ADT, and if testosterone level is not adequately suppressed, luteinizing hormone (LH) can be measured. In case of non-suppressed LH, correct administration of the GnRH analogue should be verified.

If testosterone is not sufficiently suppressed in the presence of suppressed LH, the panel considered several next management options including bilateral orchiectomy (22%), change to alternative GnRH agonist (22%), change to GnRH antagonist (44%) or addition of an AR antagonist (9%).

management of men with non-metastatic (M0) CRPC

The definition of M0 prostate cancer (rising PSA on ADT and no documented metastatic disease with radiographic imaging) is dependent upon the imaging technology chosen. In current clinical practice, the ideal combination of imaging methods to define the M0 state is unclear, as is when to use it. M0 is arguably an artificial disease stage designation, as there is a high likelihood that systemic micro-metastases are missed by commonly used imaging tools (CT and bone scintigraphy). In the absence of data from positive prospective clinical trials concerning overall survival, it is unclear what treatment options should be recommended if no metastases are found radiographically and the PSA continues to rise.

Of note, the randomised trials conducted in this setting with bone-targeted therapies with the objective of delaying the onset of bone metastases were either negative or not convincingly positive. In the placebo arm of the trial testing denosumab in this setting, time to first bone metastasis was 40.8 months in the overall population, and 26 and 18.5 months in the patients with a PSA doubling time (PSA-DT) ≤ 10 and ≤ 4 months, respectively.

### A rational approach to androgen therapy for hypogonadal men with prostate cancer [^113vPKyf]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2005). Low credibility.

With earlier detection and improved survival from early stage prostate cancer, it is likely that the numbers of men presenting with hypogonadal symptoms following curative surgery for their cancer will increase. Although testosterone supplementation is effective in improving symptoms of hypogonadism, traditionally such therapy has been contraindicated in patients who have had prostate cancer.

Benefits of TRT include improved bone mineral density, reduced fracture risk, increased muscle mass, and improved mood, sense of well being, and libido, among others. There is currently a heated debate about the theoretical association between TRT and the initiation, progression, and aggressiveness of prostate cancer; however, this link has not been uniformly studied, and any results have been contradictory and nonconclusive. Although no clear evidence links TRT to prostate cancer, the possibility of increasing the risk of a clinical manifestation of a latent pre-existing malignancy can influence the decision about TRT use. Current recommendations are to exclude prostate cancer before initiating TRT in men over age 40 and to closely monitor men in the first year of testosterone replacement, followed by observation in subsequent years.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111qnJmQ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Testosterone therapy — prostate cancer screening and monitoring when considering treatment: The baseline evaluation should identify and exclude men with a history of prostate cancer or those at high risk, and organizations strongly encourage shared decision making regarding screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and digital rectal examination (DRE). Clinicians should consider screening and monitoring for all hypogonadal men who are 55 to 69 years of age, are being considered for T-replacement therapy, are in excellent health, and have a life expectancy > 10 years. This should start at age 40 in higher-risk men (such as African Americans and those with a first-degree male relative with prostate cancer). Men < 40 years do not need prostate monitoring, and in men diagnosed > 70 years of age, the risk of death from prostate cancer is not high enough to warrant monitoring. Baseline risk assessment should consider age, family history, race, prior biopsy, elevated PSA, and examination findings; clinicians can estimate risk using a prostate cancer risk calculator.

### Testosterone therapy and prostate cancer – safety concerns are well founded [^114Y86wt]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2015). Medium credibility.

Testosterone is a potent hormone with a variety of physiological effects. The diagnosis of androgen deficiency has increased dramatically over the past decade, along with the widespread use of testosterone supplementation therapy (TST). The long-term effects of TST are uncertain, and the risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment of men who have a normal age-related decline in testosterone is substantial. The biology of the androgen receptor (AR) pathway is complex, and the saturation model does not take the heterogeneity of human prostate cancer into account. Large-scale trials to confirm the safety of testosterone with respect to the risks of prostate cancer and cardiovascular disease with reasonable confidence limits have not been done, and existing data are insufficient to exclude these adverse events. Instead, evidence suggests that prostate cancer could, in fact, be stimulated by TST, and that the risk of cardiovascular events is increased. Overall, TST seems to impose significant risks, and should be used with caution.

### Testosterone treatment in hypogonadal men: prostate-specific antigen level and risk of prostate cancer [^112J47aM]. Endocrine Practice (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in hypogonadal men after testosterone replacement by three different methods and attempt to determine any possible relationship between hypogonadism and prostate cancer in this study population.

Methods

A total of 90 consecutive men who had erectile dysfunction and were found to have hypogonadism were monitored with digital rectal examination (DRE) and measurement of PSA levels before and after testosterone replacement therapy. The patients were treated with one of three options: (1) testosterone enanthate by intramuscular injections, 200 or 300 mg every 2 or 3 weeks (N = 25); (2) testosterone nonscrotal patches, 5 mg daily (N = 16); or (3) clomiphene citrate, 50 mg orally three times a week, in patients with functional secondary hypogonadism (N = 49). Treatment was continued for 2 to 3 months, after which PSA levels were reassessed. Patients with suspicious results on DRE and increased PSA levels before or after treatment with testosterone underwent prostate biopsy. For statistical analysis, patients were categorized into two age-groups — 40 to 60 years old and 61 to 80 years old.

Results

With all methods of testosterone replacement, PSA levels increased in both age-groups. Endogenous testosterone elevation from clomiphene stimulation raised PSA levels the highest, and testosterone patches yielded the least PSA response. Ten men underwent biopsy of the prostate. In one patient, a nodule was found on DRE; the other nine men underwent biopsy because of suspicious PSA levels. Of these patients, two were found to have adenocarcinoma, and a third man who underwent rebiopsy was also found to have cancer. Therefore, 3 of the 90 patients (3.3%) had prostate cancer.

Conclusions

PSA levels increased in response to all types of testosterone replacement, regardless of whether the testosterone level was raised endogenously or exogenously. PSA levels are inappropriately low in hypogonadal men and may mask an underlying cancer. Determining PSA levels before and after testosterone treatment is recommended. Elevated PSA levels before or after testosterone therapy should prompt performance of a urologic evaluation for possible prostate biopsy.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^1139NQV1]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

There has been a marked increase in testosterone prescriptions in the past decade resulting in a growing need to give practicing clinicians proper guidance on the evaluation and management of the testosterone deficient patient.

Materials and Methods

A systematic review utilized research from the Mayo Clinic Evidence Based Practice Center and additional supplementation by the authors. Evidence-based statements were based on body of evidence strength Grade A, B, or C and were designated as Strong, Moderate, and Conditional Recommendations with additional statements presented in the form of Clinical Principles or Expert Opinions (table 1 in supplementary unabridged guideline, http://jurology.com/).

Results

This guideline was developed by a multi-disciplinary panel to inform clinicians on the proper assessment of patients with testosterone deficiency and the safe and effective management of men on testosterone therapy. Additional statements were developed to guide the clinician on the appropriate care of patients who are at risk for or have cardiovascular disease or prostate cancer as well as patients who are interested in preserving fertility.

Conclusions

The care of testosterone deficient patients should focus on accurate assessment of total testosterone levels, symptoms, and signs as well as proper on-treatment monitoring to ensure therapeutic testosterone levels are reached and symptoms are ameliorated. Future longitudinal observational studies and clinical trials of significant duration in this space will improve diagnostic techniques and treatment of men with testosterone deficiency as well as provide more data on the adverse events that may be associated with testosterone therapy.

### Does testosterone therapy increase the risk of prostate cancer? [^117NPPzn]. Endocrine Practice (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To review factors affecting use of testosterone therapy for hypogonadism including the persistent controversial link between testosterone therapy and prostate cancer.

Methods

We reviewed studies investigating the relationship between testosterone therapy and prostate cancer progression and summarized strategies for hypogonadism management and prostate monitoring.

Results

Trials of up to 36 months in length and longitudinal studies consistently fail to demonstrate an increased prostate cancer risk associated with increased testosterone levels. No evidence of an associated relationship between exogenous testosterone therapy and prostate cancer has emerged from clinical trials or adverse event reports. It does not appear that exogenous testosterone accumulates in the prostate or provokes major biologic change in the prostate gland. In addition, preliminary evidence indicates that low endogenous testosterone may confer an increased risk of prostate cancer.

Conclusions

Mounting evidence demonstrates that there is a lack of association between testosterone therapy and prostate cancer progression. Testosterone therapy may be prescribed for men for whom it was once not considered. Careful monitoring of patients with hypogonadism who are receiving testosterone therapy is imperative. Well-designed, large-scale prospective clinical trials are necessary to adequately address prostate safety in hypogonadal men receiving testosterone therapy.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113j9dCc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Testosterone therapy — prostate-specific antigen (PSA) changes and referral thresholds state that T-replacement therapy increases PSA concentrations in hypogonadal men, with a systematic review finding the average PSA increase after initiating T therapy was 0.3 ng/mL in young hypogonadal men and 0.44 ng/mL in older men; the 90% confidence limit was 1.4 ng/mL for the change in PSA concentrations between two PSA tests performed 3 to 6 months apart in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia, and increases > 1.4 ng/mL during 3 to 6 months after T therapy in hypogonadal men are unusual. In the TTrials, PSA increases > 1.4 ng/mL occurred in 2.4% of men at 3 months and 4.7% of men at 12 months in the T group and 1.6% and 0.6%, respectively, in the placebo group. A confirmed PSA > 4.0 ng/mL is a widely accepted indication for urological evaluation for prostate cancer, and because some hypogonadal men with baseline PSA between 2.6 and 4 ng/mL will develop PSA concentrations > 4.0 ng/mL after initiating T treatment, in hypogonadal men treated with T whose baseline PSA was between 2.6 and 4 ng/mL, we suggest clinicians consider both a confirmed increase of > 1.4 ng/mL in PSA concentration above baseline and the absolute PSA level when deciding to refer the patient for further urological evaluation; clinicians should confirm PSA elevations by repeating the test.

### Prostate-specific antigen levels during testosterone treatment of hypogonadal older men: data from a controlled trial [^111JPNZ8]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Context

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) changes during testosterone treatment of older hypogonadal men have not been rigorously evaluated.

Design

Double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial.

Setting

Twelve US academic medical centers.

Participants

Seven hundred ninety hypogonadal men ≥ 65 years of age with average testosterone levels ≤ 275 ng/dL. Men at high risk for prostate cancer were excluded.

Interventions

Testosterone or placebo gel for 12 months.

Main Outcomes

Percentile changes in PSA during testosterone treatment of 12 months.

Results

Testosterone treatment that increased testosterone levels from 232 ± 63 ng/dL to midnormal was associated with a small but substantially greater increase (P < 0.001) in PSA levels than placebo treatment. Serum PSA levels increased from 1.14 ± 0.86 ng/mL (mean ± SD) at baseline by 0.47 ± 1.1 ng/mL at 12 months in the testosterone group and from 1.25 ± 0.86 ng/mL by 0.06 ± 0.72 ng/mL in the placebo group. Five percent of men treated with testosterone had an increase ≥ 1.7 ng/mL and 2.5% of men had an increase of ≥ 3.4 ng/mL. A confirmed absolute PSA > 4.0 ng/mL at 12 months was observed in 1.9% of men in the testosterone group and 0.3% in the placebo group. Four men were diagnosed with prostate cancer; two were Gleason 8.

Conclusions

When hypogonadal older men with normal baseline PSA are treated with testosterone, 5% had an increase in PSA ≥ 1.7 ng/mL, and 2.5% had an increase ≥ 3.4 ng/mL.

### Is testosterone treatment good for the prostate? Study of safety during long-term treatment [^114PgMuP]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

For men with androgen deficiency on testosterone replacement therapy (TRT), clinical concern relates to the development of prostate cancer (PCa).

Aim

An updated audit of prostate safety from the UK Androgen Study was carried out to analyze the incidence of PCa during long-term TRT.

Main Outcome Measures

Diagnosis of PCa in men receiving TRT, by serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing and digital rectal examination (DRE), and its relation to different testosterone preparations.

Methods

One thousand three hundred sixty-five men aged 28–87 (mean 55) years with symptomatic androgen deficiency and receiving TRT have been monitored for up to 20 years. All patients were prescreened for PCa by DRE and PSA along with endocrine, biochemical, hematological, and urinary profiles at baseline and every 6 months. Abnormal findings or rising PSA were investigated by transrectal ultrasound and prostate biopsy. The data were compared for the four different testosterone preparations used in TRT, including pellet implants, Restandol, mesterolone, and Testogel.

Results

Fourteen new cases of PCa were diagnosed at one case per 212 years treatment, after 2,966 man-years of treatment (one case per 212 years). Time to diagnosis ranged from 1 to 12 years (mean 6.3 years). All tumors were clinically localized and suitable for potentially curative treatment. Initiating testosterone treatment had no statistically significant effect on total PSA, free PSA or free/total PSA ratio, and any initial PSA change had no predictive relationship to subsequent diagnosis of cancer.

Conclusions

The incidence of PCa during long-term TRT was equivalent to that expected in the general population. This study adds to the considerable weight of evidence that with proper clinical monitoring, testosterone treatment is safe for the prostate and improves early detection of PCa. Testosterone treatment with regular monitoring of the prostate may be safer for the individual than any alternative without surveillance.

NCCN Prostate Cancer — progression to and management of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) notes that most advanced disease eventually stops responding to traditional ADT and is categorized as castration-resistant (also known as castration-recurrent). CRPC is defined as prostate cancer that progresses clinically, radiographically, or biochemically despite castrate levels of serum testosterone (< 50 ng/dL). Patients whose disease progresses to CRPC during primary ADT should receive a laboratory assessment to assure a castrate level of testosterone (< 50 ng/dL; < 1.7 nmol/L), and imaging tests may be indicated to monitor for signs of distant metastases; factors affecting the frequency of imaging include individual risk, age, overall patient health, PSA velocity, and Gleason grade. For patients who develop CRPC, ADT with orchiectomy or an LHRH agonist or antagonist should be continued to maintain castrate serum levels of testosterone (< 50 ng/dL).

In a separate meta-analysis of 19 RCTs, 651 men received testosterone and 433 received placebo for 12 weeks to 36 months; baseline age, testosterone, and prostate-specific antigen were similar (62.9 years versus 64.4 years; 320 ng/dL versus 344 ng/dL; 1.3 ng/mL in both arms). Total prostate-related events were higher with testosterone (OR = 1.79; CI: 1.07, 2.95), while individual events were not statistically significantly different for prostate cancer (OR = 1.09), PSA elevation to > 4ng/mL or PSA increase > 1.5 ng/mL (OR = 1.19), International Prostate Symptom Score (OR = 1.08), or acute urinary retention (OR = 0.99).

### The safety of testosterone supplementation therapy in prostate cancer [^116KY229]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

Patients with prostate cancer can present with hypogonadism and experience health and quality-of-life declines related to low testosterone levels. Despite generations of urological dogma suggesting that testosterone supplementation therapy (TST) for hypogonadism causes prostate-cancer progression, a review of the contemporary literature provides evidence to the contrary. The prostate saturation model suggests that the androgen receptor (AR) is saturated at serum testosterone levels of 150–200 ng/dl, and that additional serum testosterone above this level has limited, if any, effects within the prostate. Indeed, studies in the modern era of PSA assessments indicate that TST does not affect prostate size, intraprostatic testosterone levels, or prostate-cancer progression, provided the baseline serum testosterone level is greater than this AR saturation point. However, the body of data on this subject comes from a small number of cases, and TST should only be administered to patients with prostate cancer after thorough discussions of the risks and benefits, with subsequent careful monitoring.

### Trends in testosterone therapy use in prostate cancer survivors in the United States [^112FXJXw]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Physician prescribing patterns surrounding the use of testosterone therapy (TTh) in men with a history of prostate cancer (CaP) is not well described.

Aim

To characterize the demographics and usage patterns of testosterone therapy in men with a history of prostate cancer in the United States.

Methods

This was a retrospective review using Optum's De-identified Clinformatics Data Mart database. Administrative diagnosis, procedural, pharmacy, and laboratory codes were used to identify male subjects 40 years and older with prostate cancer treated with surgery or radiation between 2003 and 2018 who went on to receive TTh. Demographic and clinical factors are identified. Temporal trends in TTh usage were reported.

Outcomes

The main outcomes were rates of testosterone prescriptions in men with treated prostate cancer and associated laboratory values such as Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and testosterone levels before TTh.

Results

126,374 men completed treatment for CaP during the study period (42,515 surgery, 75,186 radiation, 8,673 both). Of these, 3,074 men (2.4%) received testosterone after CaP treatment. Men who received testosterone were younger, more likely to have erectile dysfunction, depressive disorder, and lower pretreatment PSA values compared to men who did not receive. Median PSA levels before TTh initiation were 0–0.2 depending on CaP treatment modality and median total testosterone level was < 300 ng/dL. TTh began an average of 1.5 years after radical prostatectomy and 2.6 years after radiation treatment. We observed an increase in TTh after CaP from the beginning of the study period until it peaked in 2013 at 4.9%. After 2013, rates decreased annually until a plateau of approximately 1.8% of men. Approximately a third of men did not have testosterone labs checked before initiation of TTh.

Clinical Implications

These findings provide insight into trends in testosterone prescriptions in men after prostate cancer treatment and may aid in clinical decision-making, as well as areas for improvement in cancer survivorship care.

Strengths and Limitations

Strengths include the large sample size, length of data coverage, and real-world analysis of testosterone prescribing patterns across the United States. Limitations include the reliance on insurance claims data, the retrospective study design, and lack of additional relevant clinical variables that may impact decision making regarding TTh.

Conclusion

National trends in testosterone prescriptions for men with treated prostate cancer suggest that many men are treated with TTh after prostate cancer therapy with patterns of indications and monitoring consistent with the general population.

Testosterone therapy — prostate monitoring and urological referral — specifies that for men 55–69 years and for men 40–69 years at increased risk for prostate cancer who choose prostate monitoring, clinicians should perform digital rectal examination and check prostate-specific antigen (PSA) before initiating treatment and then recheck PSA and digital rectal examination 3–12 mo after initiating T treatment; we recommend a urological consultation for hypogonadal men receiving testosterone treatment if during the first 12 months there is a confirmed increase in PSA concentration > 1.4 ng/mL above baseline, a confirmed PSA > 4.0 ng/mL, or a prostatic abnormality detected on digital rectal examination, and after 1 year, prostate monitoring should conform to standard guidelines for prostate cancer screening based on the race and age of the patient; clinicians should confirm PSA elevations by repeating the test, and in men whose baseline PSA is between 2.6 and 4 ng/mL, an increase > 4 ng/mL during testosterone treatment should be interpreted with repeat testing and referral decisions guided by a confirmed increase of > 1.4 ng/mL above baseline as well as an absolute PSA level of > 4 ng/mL; obtain urological consultation if there is an increase in serum PSA concentration > 1.4 ng/mL within 12 mo of initiating T treatment, a confirmed PSA > 4 ng/mL, detection of a prostatic abnormality on DRE, or substantial worsening of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^115dU9ax]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Back to the Case

The patient has continued to have symptoms suggestive of androgen deficiency and reproducibly low serum testosterone concentrations. He enquired about testosterone therapy to restore his serum testosterone concentration into the normal range. Before testosterone therapy was considered and the potential benefits and risks were discussed, prostate cancer screening was discussed; untreated prostate cancer is a contraindication to testosterone therapy (Table 4). After discussion of the benefits and risks of prostate cancer screening, he elected to undergo prostate cancer screening; digital rectal exam revealed no prostate abnormality and PSA was 1.5 ng/dL. The potential benefits and risks of testosterone therapy were discussed because he had persistent symptoms of hypogonadism and reproducibly, unequivocally low serum testosterone concentrations after a year of addressing reversible causes of a suppressed HPT axis (including lifestyle changes to lose weight and optimization of treatment of sleep apnea).

Table 4.
Contraindications to testosterone therapy in men

He was counseled about the potential benefits and risks of testosterone therapy (including the lack of definitive data about the effects on cardiovascular outcomes and prostate cancer) and the absence of high-quality, long-term studies. The patient's main concerns were identified as low libido, reduced energy, and low mood. He was advised that, based on the T-Trials, effects of testosterone treatment on these symptoms should be evident within 3 to 6 months while other benefits (eg, muscle mass and function, bone health) typically take longer. Testosterone formulations (including topical and intramuscular treatment) were discussed. He preferred topical testosterone for a therapeutic trial of 6 months to determine if testosterone therapy would meaningfully improve his symptoms. He agreed that testosterone treatment would be stopped if there was no significant benefit despite normal serum testosterone concentrations during therapy. The discussion about the benefits and risks of testosterone, the goals of therapeutic trial and the plan to discontinue testosterone therapy if these goals were not met were documented in the medical record. Treatment was initiated with a standardized monitoring plan that included follow-up clinic visits to assess for effectiveness and safety at 3 and 6 months with reassessment of the dosage of testosterone based on symptoms and measurement of serum testosterone concentrations and assessment of hematocrit 3 and 6 months after initiation (and increases of dosage) of testosterone.

Background

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is foundational in the management of advanced prostate cancer (PCa) and has benefitted from a recent explosion in scientific advances. These include approval of new therapies that suppress testosterone (T) levels or inactivate its function, improvements in diagnostic and assay technologies, identification of lower therapeutic targets for T, discovery of the relevance of germline genetic mutations and identification of the benefits of sequential and combination therapies.

Methods

This review discusses the clinical profiles of the most up-to-date options for ADT, best practices for managing patients with advanced PCa and future directions in therapy.

Results and conclusions

Modern assay technologies reveal that bilateral orchiectomy results in a serum T level of approximately 15 ng/dL as compared to the historical definition of castration of T < 50 ng/dL. Evidence shows that lowering T levels to < 20 ng/dL improves patient survival and delays disease progression. Routine monitoring of T in addition to prostate-specific antigen throughout treatment is important to ensure continuing efficacy of T suppression. New drugs that inhibit androgen signaling in combination with traditional ADT suppress T activity to near zero and have significantly improved patient survival. When personalizing ADT regimens physicians should consider a number of factors including initiation and duration of ADT, monitoring of T levels and PSA, the possibility of switching monotherapies if a patient does not achieve adequate T suppression, and consideration of intermittent vs. continuous ADT according to patients' lifestyles, comorbidities, risk factors and tolerance to treatment.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116F2R6D]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Monitoring of testosterone-replacement therapy — evaluation and laboratory schedule: In hypogonadal men who have started testosterone therapy, we recommend evaluating the patient after treatment initiation to assess whether the patient has responded to treatment, is suffering any adverse effects, and is complying with the treatment regimen (Ungraded Good Practice Statement). Clinicians should maintain serum testosterone concentrations during treatment in the mid-normal range for healthy young men, evaluate symptoms and formulation-specific adverse events at each visit, and measure testosterone and hematocrit at 3 to 6 months, at 12 months, and annually thereafter; for those who choose prostate monitoring, include PSA and DRE 3 to 12 months.

Intermittent versus continuous androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) — ADT is associated with substantial side effects that generally increase with duration; intermittent ADT, based on cycles of androgen deprivation followed by re-exposure, may delay "androgen independence", reduce treatment morbidity, and improve QOL. Some patients without ADT-related morbidity may find the uncertainty of intermittent ADT not worthwhile. Intermittent ADT requires close monitoring of PSA and testosterone levels, especially during off-treatment periods, and patients may need to switch to continuous therapy upon signs of disease progression.

Context

Serum testosterone measurement has no widely accepted place in the management of patients with prostate cancer (PCa). However, several potential clinical applications of serum testosterone determination can be envisaged.

Objective

To review the role of testosterone and the androgen axis in the natural history of PCa and evaluate the evidence for the clinical application of serum testosterone measurement in patient screening, diagnosis, and management.

Evidence Acquisition

A Medline search retrieved original research and review articles relating to the androgen axis in PCa and the use of testosterone measurement for (1) assessing PCa risk in the general population, (2) adding to the specificity of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, (3) determining tumour aggressiveness, (4) assessing the efficacy of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), and (5) optimising the scheduling of intermittent ADT. Relevant data were reviewed during a roundtable discussion, and consensus recommendations were agreed.

Evidence Synthesis

A body of data implicates the androgen axis in PCa throughout its natural history. Based on current evidence, serum testosterone measurement cannot be recommended for determining PCa risk, increasing specificity of PSA testing, or assessing tumour aggressiveness. In contrast, for patients receiving ADT, there is a clear rationale for serum testosterone monitoring to ensure that castration levels are achieved. Practical recommendations for testosterone measurement during ADT are outlined. If PSA is rising while on ADT, castration levels of serum testosterone must be demonstrated before hormonal independence can be assumed. Serum testosterone levels might be considered an additional trigger for therapy reinitiation in intermittent ADT schedules. Finally, future prospective studies should further evaluate the potential relevance of testosterone measurement as an independent assessment of prognosis and treatment decision in different disease stages.

Conclusions

As a therapeutic target, serum testosterone levels should be monitored to verify response to ADT and confirm suspected castration independence.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^115yc9eS]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

AUA guideline — counseling for men with testosterone deficiency and prior prostate cancer states that patients "should be informed that there is inadequate evidence to quantify the risk-benefit ratio of testosterone therapy" (Expert Opinion). The panel further states that until there is definitive evidence demonstrating safety, "the decision to commence testosterone therapy in men with a history of prostate cancer is a negotiated decision based on the perceived potential benefit of treatment", and that "product labels for all testosterone formulations explicitly state that their use is contraindicated in men with a history of prostate cancer".

American Urological Association (AUA) guideline — clinical judgment above threshold: The Panel recognizes that in clinical practice there are men who have total testosterone levels > 300 ng/dL who are highly symptomatic and who have anecdotally experienced symptom/sign improvement with testosterone therapy, and the Panel urges clinicians to use their clinical judgment in the management of such patients; one strategy is to further evaluate patients using adjunctive tests, which might strengthen an argument for a short-term trial of testosterone therapy.
