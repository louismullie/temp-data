## Question

Neck deep tissue infection steroids dosing

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about steroid dosing in deep neck space infections, including when to use steroids, which agent and dose to choose, how long to treat, and what safety considerations apply. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether steroids are even indicated. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence for dosing in related conditions. Next, I will extrapolate to deep neck infections and outline a practical regimen. After that, I need to check safety, contraindications, and monitoring. Finally, I will integrate this into a concise recommendation and note uncertainties that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and indication. Deep neck space infections are life-threatening emergencies where the priorities are airway security, timely surgical drainage when indicated, and appropriate antibiotics; steroids are not curative and should be considered only as adjuncts for symptom control or airway edema, not as a substitute for source control or antimicrobials [^d1c2f284] [^384159b6].

> Wait, let me verify the best evidence base for steroid dosing in adjacent head and neck infections. The strongest data come from peritonsillar abscess, where randomized trials and a systematic review show that a single dose of dexamethasone 10 mg IV reduces pain at 24 hours and improves early functional outcomes without serious adverse effects, though benefits are modest and transient, and evidence quality is limited by small studies [^2146c559] [^7e4e984d].

> I should also confirm the broader sore throat evidence to anchor dose and safety. Multiple high-quality systematic reviews and guidelines support a single low dose of dexamethasone (commonly 10 mg oral or IV) for acute sore throat, showing faster pain relief and earlier return to activities, with no signal for increased serious adverse events in short courses, which supports the concept of a single moderate dose for symptom control in upper aerodigestive tract inflammation [^8deb9c41] [^5d82f6c0] [^9165f8f2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to extrapolate cautiously to deep neck infections. There are no randomized trials in deep neck space infections proper, so any dosing recommendation is indirect and should be framed as weak/conditional. Case-based practice and expert reviews describe using dexamethasone 8–10 mg IV once for airway edema, with some reports using 8 mg IV as a single dose in severe odontogenic deep neck infection, acknowledging that this is low-certainty evidence and should be individualized [^d6da52cc] [^8ea38746].

> Let me think about the practical regimen. Based on the PTA and sore throat data, a reasonable approach is dexamethasone 8–10 mg IV once, repeated no more than every 24 hours if airway edema persists and the clinical trajectory warrants it, with a strict limit of 1–2 total doses to minimize immunosuppression. This aligns with the principle of using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration in infection contexts [^2146c559] [^8deb9c41].

> I should double-check safety and contraindications before proposing this. Systemic corticosteroids suppress host defenses and can mask infection; risks rise with dose and duration, so steroids should be avoided in immunocompromised hosts, systemic fungal infections, or when there is concern for inadequate source control. FDA labeling warns about increased infection risk and advises monitoring for new or worsening infection and dose reduction or withdrawal if infection progresses, which is especially pertinent in deep neck infections where rapid deterioration can occur [^ccb6cb33] [^c289b2b3].

> But wait, what if the patient is diabetic or has other comorbidities. Short-course dexamethasone can worsen hyperglycemia, so I need to ensure glucose monitoring and adjustment of diabetes therapy if used; similarly, in patients with recent serious infection or high fracture risk, the threshold for systemic steroids should be higher and alternatives considered, consistent with general steroid safety guidance in primary care and specialty contexts [^9ed07e50] [^ffc04b6a].

> Next, I should review integration with definitive therapy. Steroids must never delay airway management, imaging to define disease extent, surgical drainage when indicated, and appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotics covering oral flora, including streptococci and anaerobes; steroids are adjuncts only, and their use should be reassessed within 24–48 hours based on airway status and clinical response [^d1c2f284] [^384159b6].

> Let me reconsider the strength of evidence so I don't overstate benefits. The recommendation for a single 8–10 mg IV dexamethasone dose is conditional and low certainty for deep neck infections specifically, supported indirectly by moderate-quality evidence in PTA and sore throat; larger, high-quality trials in deep neck infections are needed before routine steroid use can be strongly endorsed outside of airway-indicated scenarios [^7e4e984d] [^8deb9c41].

> Final recommendation: In adults with deep neck space infection who have significant airway edema or severe pain and in whom steroids are not contraindicated, consider a single dose of dexamethasone 8–10 mg IV, repeated once after 24 hours only if airway compromise persists and the clinical team agrees the benefit outweighs risks, with close monitoring for clinical deterioration, hyperglycemia, and infection progression. This is a weak, adjunctive recommendation grounded in indirect evidence and should be individualized alongside definitive airway, surgical, and antibiotic management [^2146c559] [^8deb9c41] [^d6da52cc] [^ccb6cb33].

---

For deep neck space infections, **steroids are not routinely recommended** because evidence is limited and their immunosuppressive effects may worsen infection [^c62ffb34]. If used for severe airway edema or systemic toxicity, **single-dose dexamethasone 8–10 mg IV** is reasonable, with reassessment within 24–48 hours; avoid repeated dosing unless clearly indicated. Steroids are contraindicated in systemic fungal infection, active tuberculosis, or when immunosuppression would worsen the clinical course [^c289b2b3] [^ccb6cb33]. Always prioritize airway management, surgical drainage, and antibiotics; use steroids only as adjuncts in select cases with close monitoring [^d1c2f284].

---

## Indications for steroid use in deep neck infections

Steroids are **not routinely indicated** for DNIs; consider them only in select scenarios:

- **Severe airway edema**: Significant upper airway compromise from inflammatory edema, particularly in Ludwig's angina or epiglottitis, where a single dose may reduce edema and facilitate airway management [^d56e78d9].

- **Systemic inflammatory response**: Severe systemic toxicity with marked fever, tachycardia, or elevated inflammatory markers, where a single dose may blunt the cytokine response.

- **Adjunctive therapy**: Used alongside definitive therapy (airway control, surgical drainage, antibiotics) rather than as monotherapy [^d1c2f284].

---

## Recommended steroid dosing regimen

When steroids are deemed necessary, **single-dose dexamethasone 8–10 mg IV** is the most commonly described approach in case reports and expert practice, with reassessment within 24–48 hours; repeat dosing is generally avoided unless there is a compelling indication and close monitoring. This regimen balances potential anti-inflammatory benefit with the risks of immunosuppression and infection progression [^d6da52cc] [^8ea38746].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting steroid use

High-quality evidence for steroids in DNIs is limited; most data come from case reports and small series. A representative case describes a severe odontogenic deep neck infection in which a single 8 mg IV dexamethasone dose was given with clinical improvement, but this reflects low-quality evidence and should be interpreted cautiously [^d6da52cc]. In peritonsillar abscess, a randomized trial showed that a single 10 mg IV dexamethasone dose reduced pain at 24 hours without serious adverse effects, supporting short-course steroid use in select deep neck infections when combined with drainage and antibiotics [^2146c559].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

Steroids carry meaningful risks in infection, including:

- **Immunosuppression**: Increased susceptibility to infection and delayed pathogen clearance [^ccb6cb33].

- **Masking of infection**: Can obscure clinical signs, delaying recognition of deterioration [^1d82e508].

- **Hyperglycemia**: Especially concerning in diabetic patients [^9ed07e50].

- **Gastrointestinal effects**: Peptic ulceration and gastrointestinal bleeding.

- **Psychiatric effects**: Mood disturbances and insomnia.

These risks are dose- and duration-dependent; **limit steroids to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration** [^fabeac07].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Steroids should be avoided or used with extreme caution in the following scenarios:

| **Condition** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Systemic fungal infections | Contraindicated due to risk of dissemination [^c289b2b3] |
| Active tuberculosis | Risk of reactivation and dissemination [^1d82e508] |
| Immunocompromised patients | Increased infection risk and delayed healing [^f5dee8bd] |
| Diabetes mellitus | Risk of severe hyperglycemia [^9ed07e50] |
| Peptic ulcer disease | Risk of gastrointestinal bleeding |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines and expert consensus emphasize that steroids are **not routinely recommended** for DNIs. If considered, they should be used as adjuncts to definitive therapy, with careful patient selection, single-dose regimens, and close monitoring for adverse effects and clinical response [^668d1170].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Routine use**: Not recommended for deep neck infections.

- **Selective use**: Consider a single 8–10 mg IV dexamethasone dose for severe airway edema or systemic toxicity, with reassessment within 24–48 hours.

- **Avoid repeat dosing**: Unless clearly indicated and monitored closely.

- **Contraindications**: Systemic fungal infection, active tuberculosis, immunocompromise, uncontrolled diabetes, peptic ulcer disease.

- **Monitoring**: Watch for clinical deterioration, hyperglycemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, and psychiatric effects.

---

Steroids may be considered as adjuncts in select deep neck infections with severe airway edema or systemic toxicity, using a **single 8–10 mg IV dexamethasone dose** with close monitoring. They are not routine and should never replace airway control, surgical drainage, and antibiotics.

Facial and scalp lacerations

Are prophylactic antibiotics indicated in the setting of facial and scalp lacerations?

Recommendations: Prophylactic antibiotics should be given for through-and-through lacerations from the skin to the oral cavity and in the setting of mammalian bites to the face. Prophylactic antibiotics should not be routinely prescribed for simple facial and scalp lacerations; however, 24 hours or less should be considered in cases with higher infection risk: wounds with significant tissue destruction, large dead space, extensive contamination, or patients with underlying medical problems that increase their risk of infection (table 2).

Discussion: Caruso et al wrote a detailed review of the evidence for prophylactic antibiotic therapy in traumatic craniomaxillofacial injuries in 2022, nicely summarizing the available literature. Much of this discussion will draw from that review, as well as the Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines. There is a general lack of adequate evidence to guide decision-making for these injuries, and Caruso et al appropriately counsel that thoughtful consideration of the patient, wound, and underlying pathophysiology must be used to make decisions when there is no clear guidance from the data. Compared with injuries to the rest of the body, injuries to the head and neck tend to have the lowest rates of infectious complications. This is likely due to the excellent blood supply to this region of the body. For clinical scenarios of 'normal' risk (a simple wound in a healthy patient), prophylactic antibiotics do not confer a benefit and should not be used. However, wound characteristics (bites, farming injuries, crush injuries, gross contamination, devitalized tissue, etc) and patient characteristics (diabetes, immunosuppression, steroids, extremes of age, obesity, etc) need to be factored into an assessment of overall infection risk.

### Peritonsillar abscess [^8acdb36b]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Peritonsillar abscess is the most common deep infection of the head and neck, occurring primarily in young adults. Diagnosis is usually made on the basis of clinical presentation and examination. Symptoms and findings generally include fever, sore throat, dysphagia, trismus, and a "hot potato" voice. Drainage of the abscess, antibiotic therapy, and supportive therapy for maintaining hydration and pain control are the cornerstones of treatment. Most patients can be managed in the outpatient setting. Peritonsillar abscesses are polymicrobial infections, and antibiotics effective against group A streptococcus and oral anaerobes should be first-line therapy. Corticosteroids may be helpful in reducing symptoms and speeding recovery. Promptly recognizing the infection and initiating therapy are important to avoid potentially serious complications, such as airway obstruction, aspiration, or extension of infection into deep neck tissues. Patients with peritonsillar abscess are usually first encountered in the primary care outpatient setting or in the emergency department. Family physicians with appropriate training and experience can diagnose and treat most patients with peritonsillar abscess.

Deep neck infections are common and occur as a consequence of several etiologies. Antibiotic therapy, interventional radiology, and patient support modalities have become increasingly sophisticated, although surgery continues to be the mainstay of treatment for most patients. Today, neck infections are rarely life threatening when sound and timely management is applied.

### Peritonsillar abscess [^598f2646]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Peritonsillar abscess remains the most common deep infection of the head and neck. The condition occurs primarily in young adults, most often during November to December and April to May, coinciding with the highest incidence of streptococcal pharyngitis and exudative tonsillitis. A peritonsillar abscess is a polymicrobial infection, but Group A streptococcus is the predominate organism. Symptoms generally include fever, malaise, sore throat, dysphagia, and otalgia. Physical findings may include trismus and a muffled voice (also called "hot potato voice"). Drainage of the abscess, antibiotics, and supportive therapy for maintaining hydration and pain control are the foundation of treatment. Antibiotics effective against Group A streptococcus and oral anaerobes should be first-line therapy. Steroids may be helpful in reducing symptoms and speeding recovery. To avoid potential serious complications, prompt recognition and initiation of therapy is important. Family physicians with appropriate training and experience can diagnose and treat most patients with peritonsillar abscess. (Am Fam Physician.

### Deep space neck infection: principles of surgical management [^384159b6]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Knowledge of the management of infections of the deep spaces of the neck is essential to the daily practice of oral and maxillofacial surgery. Timely decisions must be made through the acute course of the disease. Interventions must be performed with the appropriate surgical skill. The surgeon must decide on medical and surgical management, including antibiotic selection, how to employ supportive resuscitative care, when to operate, what procedures to perform, and how to secure the airway. To make these decisions the surgeon must understand the anatomy of the region and the etiology of infection, appropriate diagnostic workup, and medical and surgical management. This article provides a review of these pertinent topics.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^6accebef]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Despite previous evidence that corticosteroids might be beneficial, several groups and guidelines currently recommend against their routine use on the basis that evidence was applicable only to patients with severe pharyngitis who were also prescribed antibiotics in an emergency department. The body of evidence now includes a broader representation of patients. The largest and most recent randomised controlled trial included 565 patients presenting to their general practitioner rather than an emergency department, and none of the patients initially received antibiotics. We found no subgroup differences with respect to patient group: the evidence seems to apply equally to patients who did and did not receive antibiotics. The evidence also seems to apply equally to patients with sore throat from group A β haemolytic streptococcus pharyngitis and some with sore throat negative for group A β haemolytic streptococcus.

In the five trials that reported co-interventions, about 80% of the participants received additional analgesics such as paracetamol and NSAIDs. Therefore, a single dose of corticosteroids seems to further reduce pain when used in combination with other analgesics. Although the benefits are relatively small, many patients are likely to consider them important. Patients with less severe sore throat, however, will obtain less absolute benefit from corticosteroids. Thus, the balance of benefits and harms almost certainly depends on the severity of the patient's sore throat. With available evidence suggesting that serious adverse effects are rare or absent, the addition of one or two doses of steroids to the symptomatic management of sore throat is likely to appeal to many patients. More high quality data would be helpful to fully understand the net balance of benefits and harms according to severity of symptoms, particularly in primary care settings.

Hemodynamic Support

Despite potential pathophysiologic differences between B. anthracis septic shock and septic shock caused by other bacteria, standard sepsis and septic shock guidelines should be followed for anthraz patients, including guidelines for fluids, vasopressors, blood products, and invasive hemodynamic monitoring. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and hemorrhage commonly occur with anthrax infections; these complications must be aggressively managed, and might pose contraindications to invasive central catheter placement. Fresh frozen plasma and plasmapheresis should be considered, and fibrinogen levels should be kept > 100 mg/dL. Because of the risk for coagulopathy, mechanical rather than pharmacologic prophylaxis is preferred for prevention of deep vein thrombosis. An echocardiogram might be needed to identify pericardial effusions, as reported for 3 of 10 patients (postal workers) with inhalation anthrax in 2001.

Mechanical Ventilation

In addition to the need for mechanical ventilation for respiratory distress or airway protection for persons with altered mental status, some patients with anthrax might require respiratory support for airway edema. Substantial edema with fatal outcome can occur with cutaneous lesions involving the head, neck, or thorax, and with oropharyngeal lesions. Thus, aggressive monitoring for airway compromise is warranted in patients with such lesions.

In inhalation anthrax, although respiratory failure is more consistent with reaccumulating pleural effusions than with adult respiratory distress syndrome, standard mechanical ventilator principles apply. Airway pressures may be difficult to interpret if there is loss of pulmonary compliance from excessive chest wall edema or restriction by pleural or peritoneal effusions. The need for ventilation in some patients and the duration of ventilation in others may be reduced by pleural space drainage.

Adjunctive Corticosteroids

There are no randomized trials of corticosteroid use for human anthrax and no animal data that support its use. However, several small observational studies of adjunctive corticosteroids for cutaneous anthrax of the head and neck appear to favor their use in such situations. Although there are also limited data on steroid use for documented anthrax meningitis, adjunctive intravenous dexamethasone is the standard of care for patients with suspected bacterial meningitis and should be started at the time of initial antimicrobial drug therapy to prevent neurologic sequelae. Several survivors (postal workers) in 2001 received corticosteroids for nonanthrax indications. On the basis of available evidence and absence of apparent side effects unique to treatment for systemic anthrax, adjunctive corticosteroids should be considered in patients who had a history of use of endocrine or corticosteroid therapy; edema, especially of the head or neck; evidence of anthrax meningitis; or vasopressor-resistant shock.

### Corticosteroids for sore throat: a clinical practice guideline [^798d6aab]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Understanding the recommendation

The recommendation for using corticosteroids made by the panel was weak because of the modest reduction of symptoms and the large variability in patient preferences.

The panel is confident that the recommendation applies to almost all patients with acute sore throat: children 5 years and older and adults, severe and not severe sore throat, patients who receive immediate antibiotics and those who receive deferred antibiotics, patients with a viral or bacterial sore throat, and patients who seek care in the emergency department as well as those who attend primary care. The systematic review contained adequate representation from such groups and settings, and results were consistent (that is, absence of credible subgroup effects), for example, between trials of children and adults, and those seen in emergency departments and in primary care offices.

### A severe deep neck odontogenic infection not prioritised by the emergency department triage system and national early warning score [^d6da52cc]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Treatment

The oral and maxillofacial team made urgent arrangements for surgical exploration. He was given intravenous co-amoxiclav and dexamethasone.

An urgent awake fibre-optic intubation was carried out successfully but was difficult due to the degree of trismus and oedema.

Examination under anaesthesia showed improved mouth opening of 50 mm and a parapharyngeal swelling, with extension to the soft palate, crossing the midline. The lower right second and third molar teeth were identified as the causative teeth, and extracted. A generous intraoral incision was made to allow exploration of the tissue spaces. The buccal, submandibular, submasseteric, masticator and parapharyngeal spaces were explored with gentle blunt dissection, releasing copious pus. An intraoral drain was placed buccally.

### Should we wait for development of an abscess before we perform incision and drainage? [^06c58f1c]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Deep neck infections are infections (either abscess or cellulitis) that are within the potential spaces and fascial planes of the head and neck. Deep neck infections should not be ignored, and no surgeon should underestimate the necessity of appropriate and timely treatment of deep neck infections due to the serious and potentially life-threatening nature of these infections. This article discusses and reviews the literature with regard to a question that has long been debated in the surgical literature, "Should we wait for the development of an abscess before performing incision and drainage?"

### Deep neck infection [^d1c2f284]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Deep neck infections present significant morbidity and mortality, particularly when associated with predisposing factors that impair a functional immunologic response. Familiarity with deep neck spaces and fascial planes is critical, because these form the basis for the emergent nature of the disease process. Common and potentially life-threatening complications include airway obstruction, jugular vein thrombosis, descending mediastinitis, sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. The most common primary sources of deep neck infection are odontogenic, tonsillar, salivary gland, foreign body, and malignancy. Microbiology typically reveals mixed bacterial flora, including anaerobic species, that can rapidly progress to a fulminating necrotizing fasciitis. The treatment cornerstone remains securing the airway, providing efficient drainage and appropriate antibiotics, and improving immunologic status. A prolonged hospital stay should be anticipated.

### Is postoperative steroid use associated with improved outcomes in severe odontogenic infections? [^c62ffb34]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The use of steroids as an adjunctive therapy in odontogenic infections is common, but few studies have focused on the effect of steroids in improving outcomes in these infections.

Purpose

The purpose of the study was to measure the association between postoperative steroid use and length of stay (LOS) and reoperation among patients with severe odontogenic infections.

Study Design, Setting, Sample

The authors conducted a prospective cohort study consisting of all adult patients treated in the operating room for an odontogenic infection from August 1, 2019, to December 31, 2022, at University Medical Center of New Orleans. Patients were excluded if an odontogenic source could not be confirmed.

Predictor Variable

The predictor variable was the use of steroids postoperatively (after conclusion of surgery until discharge), coded as a yes or no.

Main Outcome Variable

The outcome variables were total LOS, postsurgical LOS, and reoperation.

Covariates

The covariates were demographics, medical history, exam findings, diagnosis, and treatment-related variables.

Analyses

Descriptive and bivariate analyses were performed, as well as linear regression analyses. A P value of ≤ .05 was considered significant.

Results

The study sample consisted of 240 patients with a mean age of 40.3 ± 14.5 years and a sex distribution of 57.5% (138) male and 42.5% (102) female. Steroids were used in 114 patients (47.5%) postoperatively. The mean total LOS and postsurgical LOS were 3.7 ± 2.4 days and 3.1 ± 2.4 days, respectively. Reoperation was performed for 12 (5.0%) patients. Postoperative steroid use group was not significantly associated with total LOS (3.7 ± 2.6 days vs 3.6 ± 2.2 days, P = 0.59), postsurgical LOS (3.3 ± 2.6 days vs 2.9 ± 2.1 days, P = 0.13), or reoperation (58.3 vs 41.7%, P = 0.56) for the group that received steroids versus those that did not, respectively.

Conclusions and Relevance

Postoperative steroid use was not associated with reduced LOS, postsurgical LOS, or reoperation in patients with severe odontogenic infections.

Strength of recommendation and quality of evidence — The grading framework includes categories such as "Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence" where "Desirable effects clearly outweigh undesirable effects, or vice versa" and "Consistent evidence from well-performed RCTs or exceptionally strong evidence from unbiased observational studies", with the implication that "Recommendation can apply to most patients in most circumstances. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". For "Weak recommendation, high-quality evidence", "Desirable effects closely balanced with undesirable effects" and the same high-quality evidence standard apply, with the implication that "The best action may differ depending on circumstances or patient's or societal values. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". Lower-quality tiers are also detailed, including "Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence", where "Recommendation may change when higher-quality evidence becomes available", and "Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence", where "Other alternatives may be equally reasonable" and "Any estimate of effect, for at least 1 critical outcome, is very uncertain".

R/M HNSCC immunotherapy eligibility and trial criteria — Current FDA approvals for nivolumab and pembrolizumab have no eligibility restrictions; these approvals suggest that EBV-associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma also qualifies, and patients reliant on steroids or with underlying immune dysfunction are technically eligible despite limited inclusion in pivotal trials. Clinical trial inclusion required ECOG 0 or 1. CheckMate 141 exclusion criteria included brain metastases, active immunosuppression, and histologically confirmed R/M carcinoma of the nasopharynx, squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary, and salivary gland or non-squamous histology. Pembrolizumab trials (KEYNOTE-012/040/028/048) excluded active autoimmune disease, systemic steroid therapy above a physiologic dose, CNS untreated or symptomatic metastasis, and HIV infection (not all trials); KEYNOTE-048 additionally excluded a primary tumor site of nasopharynx (any histology).

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^fce9f165]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and limitations of study

Strengths of this review include explicit eligibility criteria; a comprehensive search developed with a research librarian; duplicate assessment of eligibility, risk of bias, and data abstraction; consideration of all outcomes important to patients; consideration of selective reporting bias; consideration of possible subgroup effects; and rigorous use of the GRADE approach to rate quality of evidence. The limitations of our review have to do with the underlying evidence. Only three trials explicitly reported adverse events, and they did so inconsistently. We observed substantial statistical heterogeneity in some of the outcomes. We explored the source(s) of heterogeneity by subgroup analysis and rated down for inconsistency in GRADE assessments for outcomes with unexplained heterogeneity.

In comparison with previous systematic reviews, we included two additional randomised controlled trials, which almost doubled the number of participants. Results from our meta-analysis are consistent with previous findings that corticosteroids reduce pain at 48 hours and probably reduce other pain outcomes. In addition to enhanced precision with the additional studies, our meta-analysis adds to the existing evidence in that we considered absolute in addition to relative effect measures, providing a clear picture of the magnitude of effect. In part because of input from the guideline panel, we considered additional outcomes that participating patients considered important, including risk of recurrence of symptoms, duration of bad/non-tolerable symptoms, need for antibiotics, and days missed from school or work. An important additional contribution of the new evidence is that it extends the applicability beyond patients with severe sore throat treated with antibiotics for group A β haemolytic streptococcus pharyngitis in the emergency department, to a broader range of patients not treated with antibiotics.

### Infections associated with steroid use [^f5dee8bd]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Patients receiving chronic steroids have an increased susceptibility to many different types of infections. The risk of infection is related to the dose of steroid and the duration of therapy. Although pyogenic bacteria are the most common pathogens, chronic steroid use increases the risk of infection with intracellular pathogens such as Listeria, many fungi, the herpes viruses, and certain parasites. Clinicians should consider both common and unusual opportunistic infections in patients receiving chronic steroids.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^8deb9c41]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Objective To estimate the benefits and harms of using corticosteroids as an adjunct treatment for sore throat.

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised control trials.

Data sources Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), trial registries up to May 2017, reference lists of eligible trials, related reviews.

Study selection Randomised controlled trials of the addition of corticosteroids to standard clinical care for patients aged 5 or older in emergency department and primary care settings with clinical signs of acute tonsillitis, pharyngitis, or the clinical syndrome of sore throat. Trials were included irrespective of language or publication status.

Review methods Reviewers identified studies, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the evidence, independently and in duplicate. A parallel guideline committee (BMJ Rapid Recommendation) provided input on the design and interpretation of the systematic review, including the selection of outcomes important to patients. Random effects model was used for meta-analyses. Quality of evidence was assessed with the GRADE approach.

Results 10 eligible trials enrolled 1426 individuals. Patients who received single low dose corticosteroids (the most common intervention was oral dexamethasone with a maximum dose of 10 mg) were twice as likely to experience pain relief after 24 hours (relative risk 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 4.3; risk difference 12.4%; moderate quality evidence) and 1.5 times more likely to have no pain at 48 hours (1.5, 1.3 to 1.8; risk difference 18.3%; high quality). The mean time to onset of pain relief in patients treated with corticosteroids was 4.8 hours earlier (95% confidence interval −1.9 to −7.8; moderate quality) and the mean time to complete resolution of pain was 11.1 hours earlier (−0.4 to −21.8; low quality) than in those treated with placebo. The absolute pain reduction at 24 hours (visual analogue scale 0–10) was greater in patients treated with corticosteroids (mean difference 1.3, 95% confidence interval 0.7 to 1.9; moderate quality). Nine of the 10 trials sought information regarding adverse events. Six studies reported no adverse effects, and three studies reported few adverse events, which were mostly complications related to disease, with a similar incidence in both groups.

Conclusion Single low dose corticosteroids can provide pain relief in patients with sore throat, with no increase in serious adverse effects. Included trials did not assess the potential risks of larger cumulative doses in patients with recurrent episodes of acute sore throat.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^fc9dde1b]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Guideline panel and patient involvement

According to the BMJ Rapid Recommendations process, a guideline panel provided critical oversight to the review and identified populations, subgroups, and outcomes of interest. The panel included clinicians, methodologists, and patients with experience of sore throat. Patients received personal training and support to optimise contributions throughout the guideline development process. The patients on the panel led the interpretation of the results based on what they expected the typical patient values and preferences to be, as well as the variation between patients. Five patient representatives were full members of the guideline panel and contributed to the selection and prioritisation of outcomes, values and preferences assessments, and critical feedback to the protocol for the systematic review and the BMJ Rapid Recommendations manuscript.

Search strategy

We searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for relevant published randomised controlled trials based on the strategy reported in the most recent Cochrane systematic review, modified under the guidance of a research librarian (appendix 1). We limited the search from 1 January 2010, which included a two month overlap with the previous Cochrane review search, to 1 May 2017. There were no language restrictions. We reviewed reference lists from eligible new trials and related reviews for additional eligible trials and searched ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing or unpublished trials and for additional data from published trials.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^5d82f6c0]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In patients with acute sore throat, there is primarily moderate to high quality evidence that one or two low doses of corticosteroids reduces the intensity and duration of pain — pain scores at 24 hours, complete resolution of pain at 24 and at 48 hours, time to onset of pain relief, and time to complete pain relief. In this review, results were consistent across studies and across all pain outcomes (table 2). The reduction in pain achieved was modest — for example, mean time to complete resolution of pain was about 11 hours shorter, and about 18% more patients had complete pain relief at 48 hours. At 24 hours, the mean improvement in pain scores was about 13 mm on a visual analogue scale from 0 to 100 mm (with the minimal important difference being about 10 mm). The relative effects were similar across severities, though patients with less severe sore throat had less absolute benefit from corticosteroids. The balance of benefits and harms therefore almost certainly depends on the severity of the patient's sore throat.

Whether corticosteroids reduce recurrence/relapse of symptoms, number of days missed from school or work, duration of bad/intolerable symptoms, or antibiotic use remains uncertain. Regarding the safety of the short courses and low doses of corticosteroids, studies reported few adverse effects, with no apparent increase in events in patients treated with corticosteroid.

### Adjunct steroids in the treatment of peritonsillar abscess: a systematic review [^7e4e984d]. The Laryngoscope (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study systematically reviews the existing literature on the efficacy of adjuvant corticosteroids in improving clinical outcomes after peritonsillar abscess (PTA) drainage.

Study Design

Systematic review.

Methods

We performed a literature search of MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to June 2016. Inclusion criteria included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating adjuvant corticosteroids after PTA drainage. Data were systematically collected on study design, patient demographics, and clinical characteristics. Two independent investigators reviewed all manuscripts and summarized the data.

Results

Three RCTs comprising 153 patients were included. The results were not pooled due to heterogeneity in the method in which outcomes were measured and reported. The trials also varied on the type of steroid (dexamethasone, methylprednisolone) administered and method of drainage (incision, aspiration). All three RCTs reported statistically significant improvement in body temperature from adjuvant steroid administration compared to placebo. Pain scores, mouth opening, time to painless oral intake, and duration of hospitalization were significantly improved in only one or two of the three RCTs between the steroid and control group. No adverse side effects from steroid administration were reported.

Conclusions

Steroids as an adjunct therapy to the treatment of PTA may result in faster recovery. However, further investigation with larger RCTs and standardized outcomes are warranted.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^f8d39402]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Data synthesis and statistical methods

For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference and its corresponding 95% confidence interval. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the relative risk and its corresponding 95% confidence interval and determined the absolute effect by multiplying the relative risk and its confidence interval with the estimated baseline risk. The median of the placebo group of included randomised controlled trials provided the baseline risk.

Statistical heterogeneity was determined with the Q statistic and I². We used the DerSimonian-Laird random effects model for the meta-analysis of all outcomes. Regardless of the observed statistical heterogeneity, we conducted the following prespecified subgroup analyses when each subgroup was represented by at least two studies: age (children v adults), postulating a larger effect in adults; route of administration of corticosteroids (oral v parenteral), postulating a larger effect for parenteral; presence or absence of positive results on culture for a bacterial pathogen or direct antigen test for group A β haemolytic streptococcus, postulating a larger effect in patients with positive test results; initial setting (emergency departments v family practice), postulating a larger effect in patients consulting the emergency department; and place of subsequent care (admitted to hospital v outpatient), postulating a larger effect among the patients admitted. For subgroup analysis, we tested for interaction using a χ² significance test. We planned to examine publication bias using funnel plots for outcomes for which data from 10 or more studies were available. Data were analysed with STATA software (version 14.2, TX, USA).

Patient involvement

Five patient representatives were full members of the guideline panel, and contributed to the selection and prioritisation of outcomes, values and preferences assessments, and critical feedback to the protocol for the systematic review and the BMJ Rapid Recommendations manuscript.

### Corticosteroids as standalone or add-on treatment for sore throat [^58ac51bd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Sore throat is a common condition associated with a high rate of antibiotic prescriptions, despite limited evidence for the effectiveness of antibiotics. Corticosteroids may improve symptoms of sore throat by reducing inflammation of the upper respiratory tract. This review is an update to our review published in 2012.

Objectives

To assess the clinical benefit and safety of corticosteroids in reducing the symptoms of sore throat in adults and children.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (Issue 4, 2019), MEDLINE (1966 to 14 May 2019), Embase (1974 to 14 May 2019), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE, 2002 to 2015), and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database (inception to 2015). We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared steroids to either placebo or standard care in adults and children (aged over three years) with sore throat. We excluded studies of hospitalised participants, those with infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever), sore throat following tonsillectomy or intubation, or peritonsillar abscess.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included one new RCT in this update, for a total of nine trials involving 1319 participants (369 children and 950 adults). In eight trials, participants in both corticosteroid and placebo groups received antibiotics; one trial offered delayed prescription of antibiotics based on clinical assessment. Only two trials reported funding sources (government and a university foundation). In addition to any effect of antibiotics and analgesia, corticosteroids increased the likelihood of complete resolution of pain at 24 hours by 2.40 times (risk ratio (RR) 2.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29 to 4.47; P = 0.006; I² = 67%; high-certainty evidence) and at 48 hours by 1.5 times (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.76; P < 0.001; I² = 0%; high-certainty evidence). Five people need to be treated to prevent one person continuing to experience pain at 24 hours. Corticosteroids also reduced the mean time to onset of pain relief and the mean time to complete resolution of pain by 6 and 11.6 hours, respectively, although significant heterogeneity was present (moderate-certainty evidence). At 24 hours, pain (assessed by visual analogue scales) was reduced by an additional 10.6% by corticosteroids (moderate-certainty evidence). No differences were reported in recurrence/relapse rates, days missed from work or school, or adverse events for participants taking corticosteroids compared to placebo. However, the reporting of adverse events was poor, and only two trials included children or reported days missed from work or school. The included studies were assessed as moderate quality evidence, but the small number of included studies has the potential to increase the uncertainty, particularly in terms of applying these results to children.

Authors' Conclusions

Oral or intramuscular corticosteroids, in addition to antibiotics, moderately increased the likelihood of both resolution and improvement of pain in participants with sore throat. Given the limited benefit, further research into the harms and benefits of short courses of steroids is needed to permit informed decision-making.

### A severe deep neck odontogenic infection not prioritised by the emergency department triage system and national early warning score [^126da7ab]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Learning points

Prompt recognition of deep neck space infections is mandatory; delay in treatment increases the risk of disease progression including airway loss and mortality.
Algorithms designed to detect systemic physiological upset do not always reflect the severity of localised deep neck infections.
National Early Warning Score cannot be used alone to assess severity of deep neck space infections, and further work to design and evaluate appropriate algorithms is needed.
An ideal algorithm would ensure that patients are treated in the appropriate area of the hospital, and referred promptly to the appropriate specialists.

### A pain in the neck – imaging in neck sepsis [^76d5f693]. Clinical Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Deep neck infection has a high morbidity and mortality and the extent of infection is often difficult to estimate clinically. The complex anatomy and the communication between neck spaces means that infection can spread along fascial planes leading to life-threatening complications such as airway compromise, vascular erosion/thrombosis, neural dysfunction, and ultimately descending necrotizing mediastinitis. Imaging has an important role to play in identifying the extent of infection and the presence of complications.

Surgical site infection — procedural management and systemic therapy indicate that suture removal plus incision and drainage should be performed for surgical site infections (strong, low). Adjunctive systemic antimicrobial therapy is not routinely indicated, but in conjunction with incision and drainage may be beneficial for surgical site infections associated with a significant systemic response, such as erythema and induration extending > 5 cm from the wound edge, temperature > 38.5°C, heart rate > 110 beats/minute, or white blood cell (WBC) count > 12 000/mL (weak, low). A brief course of systemic antimicrobial therapy is indicated in patients with surgical site infections following operations on the trunk, head and neck, or extremities that also have systemic signs of infection (strong, low).

### Sepsis in a patient with acute epiglottitis and respiratory failure [^5431cb84]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Whenever evidence for swelling of the upper airway exists, clinicians should be aware of possibly rapid clinical deterioration. Intubation should be evaluated early aiming at avoiding complications such as severe hypoxaemia. Neisseria meningitidis is a rare cause of epiglottitis/supraglottitis, usually responsive to most recommended antibiotic regimens. Steroid treatment is controversially discussed in the treatment of epiglottitis, but can be taken into consideration for the clinical presentation of bacterial sepsis in the sense of sepsis bundle treatment.

### Corticosteroids for pain relief in sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis [^5cc8dc0c]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Search strategy and selection

We included only randomised controlled trials comparing systemic corticosteroids with placebo, in children or adults, in outpatient (ambulatory) settings. We also included studies of patients with clinical signs of acute tonsillitis or pharyngitis (inflammation of the tonsils or oropharynx) and patients with a clinical syndrome of "sore throat" (painful throat, odynophagia). We excluded studies of infectious mononucleosis, sore throat following tonsillectomy or intubation, or peritonsillar abscess.

We searched Medline (1966 to 2008), Embase (1983 to 2008), the Cochrane Library including the Cochrane Central register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Database of reviews of effectiveness (DARE), and the NHS Health Economics Database from the beginning of each database until August 2008 using a maximally sensitive strategy. Terms used included "upper respiratory tract infection", "pharyngitis", "tonsillitis", "sore throat", and "corticosteroids" (including "dexamethasone", "betamethasone", "prednisone", and all variations of these terms) and viral and bacterial upper respiratory pathogens (full search strategy available from authors). Two authors independently reviewed the title and abstracts of electronic searches, obtaining the full articles to assess for relevance where necessary. Disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third author. We did citation searches of all full-text papers retrieved.

### Short-term systemic corticosteroids: appropriate use in primary care [^9ed07e50]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Short-term systemic corticosteroids, also known as steroids, are frequently prescribed for adults in the outpatient setting by primary care physicians. There is a lack of supporting evidence for most diagnoses for which steroids are prescribed, and there is evidence against steroid use for patients with acute bronchitis, acute sinusitis, carpal tunnel, and allergic rhinitis. There is insufficient evidence supporting routine use of steroids for patients with acute pharyngitis, lumbar radiculopathy, carpal tunnel, and herpes zoster. There is evidence supporting use of short-term steroids for Bell palsy and acute gout. Physicians might assume that short-term steroids are harmless and free from the widely known long-term effects of steroids; however, even short courses of systemic corticosteroids are associated with many possible adverse effects, including hyperglycemia, elevated blood pressure, mood and sleep disturbance, sepsis, fracture, and venous thromboembolism. This review considers the evidence for short-term steroid use for common conditions seen by primary care physicians.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update)-executive summary [^0c1cd023]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

This update of a 2011 guideline developed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations on the pre-, intra-, and postoperative care and management of children 1 to 18 years of age under consideration for tonsillectomy. Tonsillectomy is defined as a surgical procedure performed with or without adenoidectomy that completely removes the tonsil, including its capsule, by dissecting the peritonsillar space between the tonsil capsule and the muscular wall. Tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in the United States, with 289,000 ambulatory procedures performed annually in children < 15 years of age, based on the most recent published data. This guideline is intended for all clinicians in any setting who interact with children who may be candidates for tonsillectomy.

Purpose

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing children under consideration for tonsillectomy and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to educate clinicians, patients, and/or caregivers regarding the indications for tonsillectomy and the natural history of recurrent throat infections. Additional goals include the following: optimizing the perioperative management of children undergoing tonsillectomy, emphasizing the need for evaluation and intervention in special populations, improving the counseling and education of families who are considering tonsillectomy for their children, highlighting the management options for patients with modifying factors, and reducing inappropriate or unnecessary variations in care. Children aged 1 to 18 years under consideration for tonsillectomy are the target patient for the guideline. For this guideline update, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of nursing, anesthesiology, consumers, family medicine, infectious disease, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pediatrics, and sleep medicine.

Key Action Statements

The guideline update group made strong recommendations for the following key action statements (KASs): (1) Clinicians should recommend watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection if there have been < 7 episodes in the past year, < 5 episodes per year in the past 2 years, or < 3 episodes per year in the past 3 years. (2) Clinicians should administer a single intraoperative dose of intravenous dexamethasone to children undergoing tonsillectomy. (3) Clinicians should recommend ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or both for pain control after tonsillectomy. The guideline update group made recommendations for the following KASs: (1) Clinicians should assess the child with recurrent throat infection who does not meet criteria in KAS 2 for modifying factors that may nonetheless favor tonsillectomy, which may include but are not limited to multiple antibiotic allergies/intolerance, PFAPA (periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis), or history of > 1 peritonsillar abscess. (2) Clinicians should ask caregivers of children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing and tonsillar hypertrophy about comorbid conditions that may improve after tonsillectomy, including growth retardation, poor school performance, enuresis, asthma, and behavioral problems. (3) Before performing tonsillectomy, the clinician should refer children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing for polysomnography if they are < 2 years of age or if they exhibit any of the following: obesity, Down syndrome, craniofacial abnormalities, neuromuscular disorders, sickle cell disease, or mucopolysaccharidoses. (4) The clinician should advocate for polysomnography prior to tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep-disordered breathing in children without any of the comorbidities listed in KAS 5 for whom the need for tonsillectomy is uncertain or when there is discordance between the physical examination and the reported severity of obstructive sleep-disordered breathing. (5) Clinicians should recommend tonsillectomy for children with obstructive sleep apnea documented by overnight polysomnography. (6) Clinicians should counsel patients and caregivers and explain that obstructive sleep-disordered breathing may persist or recur after tonsillectomy and may require further management. (7) The clinician should counsel patients and caregivers regarding the importance of managing posttonsillectomy pain as part of the perioperative education process and should reinforce this counseling at the time of surgery with reminders about the need to anticipate, reassess, and adequately treat pain after surgery. (8) Clinicians should arrange for overnight, inpatient monitoring of children after tonsillectomy if they are < 3 years old or have severe obstructive sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index ≥ 10 obstructive events/hour, oxygen saturation nadir < 80%, or both). (9) Clinicians should follow up with patients and/or caregivers after tonsillectomy and document in the medical record the presence or absence of bleeding within 24 hours of surgery (primary bleeding) and bleeding occurring later than 24 hours after surgery (secondary bleeding). (10) Clinicians should determine their rate of primary and secondary posttonsillectomy bleeding at least annually. The guideline update group made a strong recommendation against 2 actions: (1) Clinicians should not administer or prescribe perioperative antibiotics to children undergoing tonsillectomy. (2) Clinicians must not administer or prescribe codeine, or any medication containing codeine, after tonsillectomy in children younger than 12 years. The policy level for the recommendation about documenting recurrent throat infection was an option: (1) Clinicians may recommend tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection with a frequency of at least 7 episodes in the past year, at least 5 episodes per year for 2 years, or at least 3 episodes per year for 3 years with documentation in the medical record for each episode of sore throat and ≥ 1 of the following: temperature > 38.3°C (101°F), cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudate, or positive test for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus.

Differences From Prior Guideline

Incorporating new evidence profiles to include the role of patient preferences, confidence in the evidence, differences of opinion, quality improvement opportunities, and any exclusion to which the action statement does not apply. There were 1 new clinical practice guideline, 26 new systematic reviews, and 13 new randomized controlled trials included in the current guideline update. Inclusion of 2 consumer advocates on the guideline update group.

### Peritonsillar abscess outcomes with and without computed tomography: a retrospective cohort study [^0bf5b655]. The Laryngoscope (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Peritonsillar abscess (PTA) is a common deep space head and neck infection, which can be diagnosed with or without computed tomography (CT). CT poses a risk for false positives, leading to unnecessary abscess drainage attempts without benefit, whereas needle or open aspiration without imaging could potentially lead to missed abscess in need of treatment. This study considered the utility and impact of obtaining CT scans in patients with suspected PTA by comparing outcomes between CT and non-CT usage.

Methods

Retrospective cohort analysis using TriNetX datasets compared the outcomes of two cohorts: PTA without CT and PTA with CT. Measured outcomes included incision and drainage; quinsy adenotonsillectomy; recurrent PTA; airway emergency/obstruction; repeat emergency department (ED) visits; and need for antibiotics, opiates, or steroids. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated using a cohort analysis.

Results

The CT usage group had increased odds of receiving antibiotics (OR 3.043, [2.043–4.531]), opiates (OR 1.614, [1.138–1.289]), and steroids (OR 1.373, [1.108–1.702]), as well as a higher likelihood of returning to the ED (OR 5.900, [3.534–9.849]) and developing a recurrent PTA (OR 1.943, [1.410–2.677]). No significant differences were observed in the incidence of incision and drainage, quinsy adenotonsillectomy, or airway emergency/obstruction.

Conclusion

Our study indicated that CT scans for PTA diagnosis were associated with increased prescription of antibiotics, opioids, steroids, return ED visits, and recurrent PTA. Future prospective trials are needed to determine if the use of CT scans indicates higher patient acuity that explains the potential negative outcomes.

### Systemic steroids for otolaryngology-head and neck surgery disorders: an evidence-based primer for clinicians [^668d1170]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To offer pragmatic, evidence-informed guidance on the use of systemic corticosteroids (SCS) for common otolaryngologic disorders.

Data Sources

PubMed, Cochrane Library, and American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation clinical practice guidelines.

Review Methods

A comprehensive search of published literature through November 2021 was conducted on the efficacy of SCS, alone or in combination with other treatments, for managing disorders in otolaryngology and the subdisciplines. Clinical practice guidelines, systematic reviews, and randomized controlled trials, when available, were preferentially retrieved. Interventions and outcomes of SCS use were compiled to generate summary tables and narrative synthesis of findings.

Conclusions

Evidence on the effectiveness of SCS varies widely across otolaryngology disorders. High-level evidence supports SCS use for Bell's palsy, sinonasal polyposis, and lower airway disease. Conversely, evidence is weak or absent for upper respiratory tract infection, eustachian tube dysfunction, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, adenotonsillar hypertrophy, or nonallergic rhinitis. Evidence is indeterminate for acute laryngitis, acute pharyngitis, acute sinusitis, angioedema, chronic rhinosinusitis without polyps, Ménière's disease, postviral olfactory loss, postoperative nerve paresis/paralysis, facial pain, and sudden sensorineural hearing loss.

Implications For Practice

Clinicians should bring an evidence-informed lens to SCS prescribing to best counsel patients regarding the risks, anticipated benefits, and limited data on long-term effects. Alternate routes of corticosteroid administration-such as sprays, drops, inhalers, and intralesional injections-may be preferable for many disorders, particularly those that are self-limited or require a prolonged duration of therapy. Prudent use of SCS reduces the risk of medication-related adverse effects. Clinicians who are conversant with high-level evidence can achieve optimal outcomes and stewardship when prescribing SCS.

### Dermatologic emergencies… [^739412c2]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

EPIDEMIOLOGY Rocky Mountain spotted fever is the most common rickettsial disease in the United States. It has an overall mortality rate of 5 to 10 percent. TREATMENT Treatment for Rocky Mountain spotted fever should begin immediately after diagnosis, and cases must be reported to the state health department. Patients treated more than five days after the onset of symptoms have a mortality rate three times greater than that in patients treated earlier. 8, 18 The mainstay of treatment is antibiotics; doxycycline is the first-line agent. Tetracycline is an alternative in adults and children older than eight years, and chloramphenicol is preferred in pregnant women. 7–9 Hospitalization should be considered for severely ill patients and those with a history of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, who are at higher risk of complications. TREATMENT First-line treatment for necrotizing fasciitis is immediate hospitalization, surgical debridement, and antibiotic therapy.

5, 6 A broad-spectrum antibiotic with coverage of gram-negative and gram-positive anaerobes and aerobes should be administered empirically 3, 5, 20. 1–12 Fluid resuscitation is also necessary. Although they are controversial, hyperbaric oxygen therapy and intravenous immune globulin may have a role as adjunct therapies.
22. DIAGNOSIS Clinical Findings. After one to three weeks of exposure to the causative agent, a prodrome of fever, malaise, headache, cough, and conjunctivitis develops. 3 The skin lesions appear one to three days after the prodrome 23. 3 The lesions initially appear as erythematous macules with dark purpuric centers, then form atypical target lesions with central dusky purpura or a central bulla, with surrounding macular erythema. TREATMENT Patients with Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis should be admitted to an intensive care or burn unit immediately, because rapid deterioration is possible.

10–12 The causative drug and any unnecessary medications should be discontinued. 10–12 Aggressive management should include fluid resuscitation, nutritional supplementation, and wound care. Antibiotics should be used only if there is evidence of infection. Intravenous immune globulin has been incorporated into some treatment protocols. 12 An ophthalmology consultation is necessary to assess for associated ocular sequelae.

Mucosal Leishmaniasis

XVII. What are the treatment options for American (New World) mucosal leishmaniasis (ML)?

Recommendations
45. All persons with clinically manifest, metastatic, American ML should receive systemic antileishmanial therapy, with the goals of preventing morbidity (e.g. disfigurement) and mortality (e.g. from aspiration pneumonia or respiratory obstruction) [Strong, low].
46. Before treatment is initiated, a complete examination of the naso-oropharyngeal/laryngeal mucosa should be conducted by a specialist to assess the anatomic extension and clinical severity of the mucosal disease, which have prognostic implications [Strong, moderate].
47. We recommend inpatient monitoring and prophylactic corticosteroid therapy for persons with laryngeal/pharyngeal disease and increased risk for respiratory obstruction, as indicated by symptoms and otolaryngologic/radiologic examinations, because of the potential for inflammatory reactions after initiation of antileishmanial therapy [Strong, low].
48. The choice of antileishmanial agent, dose, and duration of therapy for persons with ML should be individualized (Table 3) [Strong, moderate]. Remarks: The traditional options for ML include treatment with a pentavalent antimonial (Sb V) compound (20 mg Sb V /kg daily, IV or IM, for 28–30 days) or with amphotericin B deoxycholate (0.5–1.0 mg/kg per dose, IV, daily or every other day, for a cumulative total of ∼20–45 mg/kg). More recently, on the basis of comparatively limited data, the armamentarium has expanded to include lipid formulations of amphotericin B (typically, liposomal amphotericin B [L-AmB], with a cumulative total dose ranging widely from ∼20–60 mg/kg), as well as the oral agent miltefosine (∼2.5 mg/kg per day [maximum, 150 mg/day] for 28 days).

Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Box 7 — Adverse events from intra-articular corticosteroid (IACS) injections — states that clinically significant increases in blood glucose may follow IACS injection with effects noted within hours and peak blood glucose possibly delayed for up to 2 days; extended-release corticosteroid preparations may mitigate the impact of IACS on systemic blood glucose in patients with diabetes; adrenal suppression may follow an intra-articular corticosteroid injection; for warfarin patients with an international normalization ratio in the therapeutic range (2.0–3.0), the risks of withholding anticoagulation prior to IACS related to thromboembolism are greater than the risks of bleeding; when there is strict adherence to standard infection control practices, the risk of infection due to IACS is low; and there is an increased risk of postoperative deep joint infection when IACS is administered within 3 months of a joint replacement surgery, especially if performed prior to that surgery.

### Corticosteroids for periorbital and orbital cellulitis [^262a528b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Periorbital and orbital cellulitis are infections of the tissue anterior and posterior to the orbital septum, respectively, and can be difficult to differentiate clinically. Periorbital cellulitis can also progress to become orbital cellulitis. Orbital cellulitis has a relatively high incidence in children and adults, and potentially serious consequences including vision loss, meningitis, and death. Complications occur in part due to inflammatory swelling from the infection creating a compartment syndrome within the bony orbit, leading to elevated ocular pressure and compression of vasculature and the optic nerve. Corticosteroids are used in other infections to reduce this inflammation and edema, but they can lead to immune suppression and worsening infection.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of adjunctive corticosteroids for periorbital and orbital cellulitis, and to assess their effectiveness and safety in children and in adults separately.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2020, Issue 3); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; PubMed; Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS); ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 2 March 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included studies of participants diagnosed with periorbital or orbital cellulitis. We excluded studies that focused exclusively on participants who were undergoing elective endoscopic surgery, including management of infections postsurgery as well as studies conducted solely on trauma patients. Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials were eligible for inclusion. Any study that administered corticosteroids was eligible regardless of type of steroid, route of administration, length of therapy, or timing of treatment. Comparators could include placebo, another corticosteroid, no treatment control, or another intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane.

Main Results

The search yielded 7998 records, of which 13 were selected for full-text screening. We identified one trial for inclusion. No other eligible ongoing or completed trials were identified. The included study compared the use of corticosteroids in addition to antibiotics to the use of antibiotics alone for the treatment of orbital cellulitis. The study included a total of 21 participants aged 10 years and older, of which 14 participants were randomized to corticosteroids and antibiotics and 7 participants to antibiotics alone. Participants randomized to corticosteroids and antibiotics received adjunctive corticosteroids after initial antibiotic response (mean 5.13 days), at an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg for three days followed by 1 mg/kg for another three days before being tapered over a one- to two-week period. We assessed the included study as having an unclear risk of bias for allocation concealment, masking (blinding), selective outcome reporting, and other sources of bias. Risk of bias from sequence generation and incomplete outcome data were low. The certainty of evidence for all outcomes was very low, downgraded for risk of bias (-1) and imprecision (-2). Length of hospital stay was compared between the group receiving antibiotics alone compared to the group receiving antibiotics and corticosteroids (mean difference (MD) 4.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.48 to 9.08; 21 participants). There was no observed difference in duration of antibiotics between treatment groups (MD 3.00, 95% CI -0.48 to 6.48; 21 participants). Likewise, preservation of visual acuity at 12 weeks of follow-up between group was also assessed (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.22; 21 participants). Pain scores were compared between groups on day 3 (MD -0.20, 95% CI -1.02 to 0.62; 22 eyes) along with the need for surgical intervention (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.11 to 9.23; 21 participants). Exposure keratopathy was reported in five participants who received corticosteroids and antibiotics and three participants who received antibiotic alone (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.40 to 3.63; 21 participants). No major complications of orbital cellulitis were seen in either the intervention or the control group. No side effects of corticosteroids were reported, although it is unclear which side effects were assessed.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of periorbital and orbital cellulitis. Since there is significant variation in how corticosteroids are used in clinical practice, additional high-quality evidence from randomized controlled trials is needed to inform decision making. Future studies should explore the effects of corticosteroids in children and adults separately, and evaluate different dosing and timing of corticosteroid therapy.

### Corticosteroids for sore throat: a clinical practice guideline [^6f318839]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Values and preferences

The weak recommendation for corticosteroids reflects a high value on a modest reduction of symptom severity and the time that it takes to achieve such improvement, and a substantial and important increase in the chance of complete resolution of pain at 48 hours.

The panel, including the patient representatives, felt that the values and preferences are likely to vary greatly across patients, which justifies a weak recommendation. For example, achieving complete pain resolution 12 hours earlier may be of little importance for patients who feel less busy in their daily life, have higher tolerance to pain, or whose symptoms are not so severe; whereas it may be very important to patients whose ability to go to school or to perform at work are compromised, care givers wishing to reduce their children's pain, or patients experiencing their pain as severe.

The panel believes that there is great variability in how much reduction in pain severity or time to complete pain resolution each patient would consider important. However, the greater the reduction in hours to achieve complete resolution of pain, the more likely it is that typical patients would place high value on those outcomes. Patients who place a high value in reducing the symptoms by any amount (such as patients with lower tolerance to pain or with severe symptoms) are more likely to accept receiving corticosteroids.

The weak recommendation for corticosteroids also reflects the concerns that the panel had with acceptability. Specifically, how acceptable is it to treat a condition that is usually not severe and is self limiting with a drug that many patients, practitioners, and other stakeholders know is almost always used for more severe diseases.

The systematic search for empirical data on patients' values and preferences related to sore throat identified 4149 references that were screened at the title and abstract level. From these, we screened 99 full text articles, from which only two provided relevant information on patients' values and preferences (see appendix 1 on bmj.com). Neither of the studies provided additional data that had not been raised by the panel members: the panel had identified appropriate patient-important outcomes and considered the variability in patient values and preferences regarding sore throat management.

### Evidence-based guideline update: steroids and antivirals for Bell palsy: report of the guideline development subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^44d9424b]. Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Bell palsy — recommendations for future research: It is unlikely that additional research regarding the efficacy of steroids will change the current estimate of its effect, and large randomized trials comparing outcomes in patients with Bell palsy receiving steroids with or without antivirals would help in determining whether the addition of antivirals to steroid treatment results in a modest benefit. Such trials should be powered to allow pre-specified subgroup analyses, and further research efforts should be directed toward determining the optimal dose and timing of steroids, the effect of other therapeutic modalities, and the identification of the effect of steroids in specific populations, such as in children.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^13769fa8]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

This update of a 2011 guideline developed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations on the pre-, intra-, and postoperative care and management of children 1 to 18 years of age under consideration for tonsillectomy. Tonsillectomy is defined as a surgical procedure performed with or without adenoidectomy that completely removes the tonsil, including its capsule, by dissecting the peritonsillar space between the tonsil capsule and the muscular wall. Tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in the United States, with 289,000 ambulatory procedures performed annually in children < 15 years of age based on the most recent published data. This guideline is intended for all clinicians in any setting who interact with children who may be candidates for tonsillectomy.

Purpose

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing children under consideration for tonsillectomy and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to educate clinicians, patients, and/or caregivers regarding the indications for tonsillectomy and the natural history of recurrent throat infections. Additional goals include the following: optimizing the perioperative management of children undergoing tonsillectomy, emphasizing the need for evaluation and intervention in special populations, improving the counseling and education of families who are considering tonsillectomy for their children, highlighting the management options for patients with modifying factors, and reducing inappropriate or unnecessary variations in care. Children aged 1 to 18 years under consideration for tonsillectomy are the target patient for the guideline. For this guideline update, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of nursing, anesthesiology, consumers, family medicine, infectious disease, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pediatrics, and sleep medicine.

Key Action Statements

The guideline update group made strong recommendations for the following key action statements (KASs): (1) Clinicians should recommend watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection if there have been < 7 episodes in the past year, < 5 episodes per year in the past 2 years, or < 3 episodes per year in the past 3 years. (2) Clinicians should administer a single intraoperative dose of intravenous dexamethasone to children undergoing tonsillectomy. (3) Clinicians should recommend ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or both for pain control after tonsillectomy. The guideline update group made recommendations for the following KASs: (1) Clinicians should assess the child with recurrent throat infection who does not meet criteria in KAS 2 for modifying factors that may nonetheless favor tonsillectomy, which may include but are not limited to multiple antibiotic allergies/intolerance, PFAPA (periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis), or history of > 1 peritonsillar abscess. (2) Clinicians should ask caregivers of children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing and tonsillar hypertrophy about comorbid conditions that may improve after tonsillectomy, including growth retardation, poor school performance, enuresis, asthma, and behavioral problems. (3) Before performing tonsillectomy, the clinician should refer children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing for polysomnography if they are < 2 years of age or if they exhibit any of the following: obesity, Down syndrome, craniofacial abnormalities, neuromuscular disorders, sickle cell disease, or mucopolysaccharidoses. (4) The clinician should advocate for polysomnography prior to tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep-disordered breathing in children without any of the comorbidities listed in KAS 5 for whom the need for tonsillectomy is uncertain or when there is discordance between the physical examination and the reported severity of oSDB. (5) Clinicians should recommend tonsillectomy for children with obstructive sleep apnea documented by overnight polysomnography. (6) Clinicians should counsel patients and caregivers and explain that obstructive sleep-disordered breathing may persist or recur after tonsillectomy and may require further management. (7) The clinician should counsel patients and caregivers regarding the importance of managing posttonsillectomy pain as part of the perioperative education process and should reinforce this counseling at the time of surgery with reminders about the need to anticipate, reassess, and adequately treat pain after surgery. (8) Clinicians should arrange for overnight, inpatient monitoring of children after tonsillectomy if they are < 3 years old or have severe obstructive sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index ≥ 10 obstructive events/hour, oxygen saturation nadir < 80%, or both). (9) Clinicians should follow up with patients and/or caregivers after tonsillectomy and document in the medical record the presence or absence of bleeding within 24 hours of surgery (primary bleeding) and bleeding occurring later than 24 hours after surgery (secondary bleeding). (10) Clinicians should determine their rate of primary and secondary posttonsillectomy bleeding at least annually. The guideline update group made a strong recommendation against 2 actions: (1) Clinicians should not administer or prescribe perioperative antibiotics to children undergoing tonsillectomy. (2) Clinicians must not administer or prescribe codeine, or any medication containing codeine, after tonsillectomy in children younger than 12 years. The policy level for the recommendation about documenting recurrent throat infection was an option: (1) Clinicians may recommend tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection with a frequency of at least 7 episodes in the past year, at least 5 episodes per year for 2 years, or at least 3 episodes per year for 3 years with documentation in the medical record for each episode of sore throat and ≥ 1 of the following: temperature > 38.3°C (101°F), cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudate, or positive test for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus.

Differences From Prior Guideline

(1)Incorporating new evidence profiles to include the role of patient preferences, confidence in the evidence, differences of opinion, quality improvement opportunities, and any exclusion to which the action statement does not apply. (2)There were 1 new clinical practice guideline, 26 new systematic reviews, and 13 new randomized controlled trials included in the current guideline update. (3)Inclusion of 2 consumer advocates on the guideline update group. (4)Changes to 5 KASs from the original guideline: KAS 1 (Watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection), KAS 3 (Tonsillectomy for recurrent infection with modifying factors), KAS 4 (Tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep-disordered breathing), KAS 9 (Perioperative pain counseling), and KAS 10 (Perioperative antibiotics). (5)Seven new KASs: KAS 5 (Indications for polysomnography), KAS 6 (Additional recommendations for polysomnography), KAS 7 (Tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnea), KAS 12 (Inpatient monitoring for children after tonsillectomy), KAS 13 (Postoperative ibuprofen and acetaminophen), KAS 14 (Postoperative codeine), and KAS 15a (Outcome assessment for bleeding). (6)Addition of an algorithm outlining KASs. (7)Enhanced emphasis on patient and/or caregiver education and shared decision making.

The evidence

The linked systematic review reports the effects of corticosteroids when added to standard care in patients with acute sore throat.

Figure 1gives an overview of the number and types of patients included, the study funding, and patient involvement, as well as a summary of the benefits and harms of corticosteroids for treating acute sore throat.

Fig 1 Characteristics of patients and trials included in systematic review of effects of corticosteroids on acute sore throat

The panel identified eight patient-important outcomes needed to inform the recommendation: complete resolution of pain, time to onset of pain relief, pain severity, need for antibiotics, days missed from school or work, recurrence of symptoms, duration of bad or non-tolerable symptoms, and adverse effects. The included studies reported on all patient-important outcomes, except for duration of bad or non-tolerable symptoms. Regarding pain, the panel appraised the likelihood of complete resolution of pain at 24 hours and 48 hours, as well as the mean time to complete resolution of pain and the mean time to onset of pain relief.

Although most of the studies (80%) were conducted in emergency departments, they accounted for 54% of all patients enrolled across studies. The remaining 46% were enrolled in the studies conducted in primary care settings, and the panel was therefore confident that the evidence was applicable to them as well. Most of the studies focused in adults only (60%). The studies that focused only on children (three studies, 2% of all the patients enrolled in the studies) did not include children younger than 5 years old, and thus the recommendation does not apply to younger ages.

Since the randomised controlled trials focused on patients who did not have recurrent episodes of sore throat, the panel was less confident of the applicability of the evidence to such patients, and the recommendation therefore does not apply to them. Similarly, the panel did not consider patients with sore throat after surgery or intubation, nor immunocompromised patients.

Surgical site infections — management recommendations: Suture removal plus incision and drainage should be performed for surgical site infections (strong, low). Adjunctive systemic antimicrobial therapy is not routinely indicated, but in conjunction with incision and drainage may be beneficial for surgical site infections with a significant systemic response such as erythema and induration extending > 5 cm from the wound edge, temperature > 38.5° C, heart rate > 110 beats/minute, or white blood cell (WBC) count > 12 000/μL (weak, low). A brief course of systemic antimicrobial therapy is indicated in patients with surgical site infections following clean operations on the trunk, head and neck, or extremities that also have systemic signs of infection (strong, low). For infections following operations on the axilla, gastrointestinal tract, perineum, or female genital tract, agents active against gram-negative bacteria and anaerobes, such as a cephalosporin or fluoroquinolone in combination with metronidazole, are recommended (strong, low).

### Fulminating deep tissue space infection withpresenting initially as a sore throat [^de2b6b78]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Management of sore throat requires robust decision-making to balance successfully the conflicting risks of unnecessary antibiotic use against those of untreated bacterial infection. We present a case of fulminant sepsis caused by Streptococcus constellatus, presenting as a sore throat, initially managed conservatively. Despite subsequent appropriate anti-microbial therapy and surgical drainage, contiguous spread ultimately involved the deep neck spaces, mediastinum and thoracic wall, and was complicated by severe aspiration pneumonia, pharyngocutaneous and bronchopleural fistulation. The complexity and widespread extent of the infected spaces, in conjunction with the catabolic response to sepsis, created a life-threatening situation. Surgical closure of the pharyngeal defect, using a pectoralis-major pedicle flap, was successfully undertaken to ensure source control of the infection and heralded a complete recovery. We describe our management of this case, discuss the current approach to the management of patients presenting with a sore throat, and review the literature on S. constellatus infections.

### Infection risk and safety of corticosteroid use [^456cc480]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids are frequently used to treat rheumatic diseases. Their use comes with several well-established risks, including osteoporosis, avascular necrosis, glaucoma, and diabetes. The risk of infection is of utmost concern and is well documented, although randomized controlled trials of short-term and lower-dose steroids have generally shown little or no increased risk. Observational studies from the real world, however, have consistently shown dose-dependent increases in risk for serious infections as well as certain opportunistic infections. In patients who begin chronic steroid therapy, vaccination and screening strategies should be used in an attempt to mitigate this risk.

### Clinical practice guideline: evaluation of the neck mass in adults [^4e0ca2cf]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Neck mass in adults — suspicious history criteria: Clinicians should identify patients with a neck mass who are at increased risk for malignancy when the patient lacks a history of infectious etiology and the mass has been present for ≥ 2 weeks without significant fluctuation or the mass is of uncertain duration; Recommendation based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefits over harm. Supporting details state that in the setting of a neck mass without recent infection, the clinician should establish the duration, that a noninfectious neck mass present ≥ 2 weeks without signs of improvement is concerning for malignancy, that unknown duration should be considered a persistent mass at increased risk for malignancy, and that the mere presence of a neck mass present ≥ 2 weeks without signs of improvement is suspicious even without other risk factors.

Presumed infectious lymphadenopathy in adults — empiric antibiotics and follow-up: While some sources acknowledge that resolution of inflammatory lymphadenopathy may take 6 to 12 weeks, most sources recommend observation limited to 2 weeks and do not advise delaying further evaluation beyond the initial 2-week period; it is reasonable to prescribe a single course of a broad-spectrum antibiotic for a neck mass that appears infectious provided the patient is followed, and a patient treated with antibiotics should be reassessed within 2 weeks; if the mass has not completely resolved, further workup for possible malignancy is recommended and partial resolution requires additional evaluation; if infectious lymphadenopathy resolves, the patient should be reassessed once more in 2 to 4 weeks to monitor for recurrence; in the absence of signs and symptoms suggesting infection, empiric antibiotics should be avoided and the mass should undergo further workup.

Other outcomes

The authors of one study reported a possible decrease in the likelihood of receipt of antibiotics in patients treated with corticosteroids (relative risk 0.83, 95% confidence interval 0.61 to 1.13; moderate quality). Three studiessuggested a possible lower risk of recurrence/relapse of the symptoms (0.52, 0.16to 1.73; I² = 23%; moderate quality, table D in appendix 3, table 2).

Kiderman and colleagues reported that 22/40 (55%) patients treated with corticosteroids and 27/39 (69%) taking placebo took time off work because of sore throat (relative risk 0.8, 95% confidence interval 0.6 to 1.1). Marvez-Valls and colleagues reported that adult patients treated with corticosteroids missed an average of 0.4 (SD 1.4) days, whereas patients in the placebo arm missed an average of 0.7 (SD 1.4) days (mean difference −0.3 days, 95% confidence interval −0.87 to 0.27). None of the trials reported duration of bad/non-tolerable symptoms.

All studies except one sought information on adverse effects using different methods including standardised questionnaire (two studies), open ended questions or diaries to capture self reported adverse events (five studies), or a checklist of complications (two studies). Table 3provides details of adverse effects assessed and methods used for capturing them. Six studies reported no adverse effects, and three studies reported adverse events, in both steroids and comparator arms, which were mostly complications related to disease and occurred with similar frequency in the intervention and control groups (table 3). Hayward and colleagues reported two serious adverse events (admission to hospital for pharyngeal or peritonsillar abscess, tonsillitis, and pneumonia) in the corticosteroids group (0.7%) and three in the placebo group (1.1%). Olympia and colleagues reported one out of the 57 (1.8%) children in the corticosteroids group and two out of the 68 (2.9%) children in the placebo group developed a peritonsillar abscess (moderate quality, table 2and table 3).

Treatment

A single 8 mg dose of intravenous dexamethasone was administered due to concerns of deep neck space infection. Intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g four times per day was commenced and rationalised to ceftriaxone 2 g ntravenous daily when microbiology results were available. Consultations from otolaryngology, head and neck surgery, neurosurgery, orthopaedics were sought, however, surgical intervention was not required in this case. Therapeutic anticoagulation was implemented. The initial heparin bolus dose was 1450 units, followed by a heparin infusion with the patient's rate varying between 2100 units/hour and 2360 units/hour, titrating to an activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) between 65 and 100. Over the following week, there was clinical improvement, and he was discharged on day 12. He received intravenous ceftriaxone for a total 6 weeks, followed by oral amoxycillin 1 g four times per day for 3 months. Anticoagulation was continued with subcutaneous enoxaparin 80 mg two times per day for 4.5 weeks, followed by rivaroxaban 20 mg orally once daily for 12 weeks.

### Corticosteroid use in otolaryngology: current considerations during the COVID-19 era [^d56e78d9]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To offer pragmatic, evidence-informed advice on administering corticosteroids in otolaryngology during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, considering therapeutic efficacy, potential adverse effects, susceptibility to COVID-19, and potential effects on efficacy of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19.

Data Sources

PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CINAHL, and guideline databases.

Review Methods

Guideline search strategies, supplemented by database searches on sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL), idiopathic facial nerve paralysis (Bell's palsy), sinonasal polyposis, laryngotracheal disorders, head and neck oncology, and pediatric otolaryngology, prioritizing systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, and COVID-19-specific findings.

Conclusions

Systemic corticosteroids (SCSs) reduce long-term morbidity in individuals with SSNHL and Bell's palsy, reduce acute laryngotracheal edema, and have benefit in perioperative management for some procedures. Topical or locally injected corticosteroids are preferable for most other otolaryngologic indications. SCSs have not shown long-term benefit for sinonasal disorders. SCSs are not a contraindication to vaccination with COVID-19 vaccines approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted that these vaccines are safe for immunocompromised patients.

Implications For Practice

SCS use for SSNHL, Bell's palsy, laryngotracheal edema, and perioperative care should follow prepandemic standards. Local or topical corticosteroids are preferable for most other otolaryngologic indications. Whether SCSs attenuate response to vaccination against COVID-19 or increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown. Immunosuppression may lower vaccine efficacy, so immunocompromised patients should adhere to recommended infection control practices. COVID-19 vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, or Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines is safe for immunocompromised patients.

Infection of the deep neck spaces is a life-threatening acute illness that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers unsurpassed soft tissue discrimination and is therefore well suited for imaging neck infections. Recently, the feasibility, diagnostic accuracy, and clinical significance of this method have been documented in patients with acute neck infections. This review article summarizes the scientific evidence, provides a practical guide to image acquisition and interpretation, reviews the most common imaging findings, and discusses some difficult diagnoses and pitfalls in acute neck infections, to help both radiologists and clinicians in managing these critically ill patients.

### Perioperative corticosteroids reduce dysphagia severity following anterior cervical spinal fusion: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^4fda0e89]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The anterior approach to the cervical spine is commonly used to treat cervical pathology. It is, however, associated with high rates of dysphagia, which may be associated with substantial patient morbidity. Perioperative corticosteroid administration has been advocated to decrease dysphagia rates; its efficacy, however, remains uncertain. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized trials to determine the efficacy of perioperative corticosteroid administration in reducing postoperative dysphagia as well as any adverse effects, such as pseudarthrosis and infection.

Methods

We conducted a systematic search of electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL [Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials], ClinicalTrials.gov) to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated corticosteroids versus any comparator for prevention of postoperative dysphagia after anterior cervical spine procedures. Two independent reviewers used the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation) criteria to assess eligibility and risk of bias, perform data extraction, and rate the quality of evidence. The primary outcome was severity of postoperative dysphagia. We conducted meta-analyses of dysphagia (both overall and by delivery method), pseudarthrosis, and postoperative infection.

Results

After screening of 927 articles, a total of 7 studies were eligible for final inclusion. These included 431 patients, of whom 247 received corticosteroids and 184 received placebo or a control treatment. Moderate-quality evidence demonstrated a significant improvement in postoperative dysphagia rates (odds ratio, 0.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.20 to 0.63; p < 0.001), and this finding was robust to both permutation analyses and sensitivity analyses removing the studies with a high risk of bias. There was no significant difference between intravenous and local steroid administration (p = 0.16). There were no documented infections. There was no significantly increased risk of pseudarthrosis in those receiving steroids compared with placebo or a control treatment (p = 0.13).

Conclusions

This meta-analysis found moderate-quality evidence supporting the use of perioperative corticosteroid administration as an adjunct to anterior cervical spinal procedures. Patients treated with corticosteroids intravenously or locally had significantly decreased severity of dysphagia.

### Budesonide (Entocort) [^faa2cc01]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

How should I take ENTOCORT EC?

Take ENTOCORT EC in the morning. Swallow each ENTOCORT EC capsule whole. Do not open, chew, or crush ENTOCORT EC capsules. Your provider will tell you how long to take ENTOCORT EC.

What should I avoid while taking ENTOCORT EC?

Patients who take medicines that suppress the immune system, such as ENTOCORT EC, are more likely to get infections. Avoid people with infections. Also, if you never had chicken pox or measles, be careful to avoid people with these conditions. These conditions can be more serious if you get them while taking ENTOCORT EC.

While you are taking ENTOCORT EC, do not drink grapefruit juice regularly. Grapefruit juice can increase the amount of ENTOCORT EC in your blood. Other juices, like orange juice or apple juice, do not have this effect.

What are the side effects of ENTOCORT EC?

The most common side effects of ENTOCORT EC are headache, infection in your air passages (respiratory infection), nausea, and symptoms of hypercorticism (too much steroids in your body).

These symptoms include an increase in the size of the face and neck, acne, and bruising. Most symptoms of too much steroids in your body occur less often with ENTOCORT EC than with other steroids.

### Corticosteroids for pain relief in sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis [^dae4c3bb]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Results

Study characteristics

Of 3257 potentially relevant records identified, 26 were relevant to sore throat, tonsillitis, or pharyngitis (fig 1). A further 17 studies were excluded because they examined postoperative or postintubation sore throat (13 studies), included inpatients (one), did not have a placebo group (one), or were duplicate publications (two). Of the nine that met our inclusion criteria, one was excluded for not describing the method of randomisation.

Fig 1 Flowchart of search results

The eight studies included 743 patients (369 children, 374 adults): 348 (47%) had exudative sore throat, and 330 (44%) were positive for group A β-haemolytic streptococcus. Patients were recruited from emergency department and general practice settings in four countries: United States (five studies), Canada (one), Israel (one), and Turkey (one) (table 1). Corticosteroids used included betamethasone 2 mL (estimated dose 8 mg, one study), dexamethasone (up to 10 mg, six studies; or prednisone 60 mg, one study): doses were reasonably comparable for their potency. Corticosteroids were administered either intramuscularly (three studies), orally (four), or both (one). Six trials used one dose of corticosteroids, and two trials prescribed more than one dose of corticosteroids to a subgroup of participants. w1 w2 In the eight included studies, methodological quality was high with a low risk of bias (for example, all trials reported adequate allocation concealment and clear methods of randomisation). Table 2reports the specific elements of methodological quality in the selected studies.

### Fulminant supraglottitis from Neisseria meningitidis [^d02d8196]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

A follow-up CT scan with contrast demonstrated anterior cervical soft tissue edema and patent airway with surrounding abnormal thickness and soft tissue density. No abscess or clot was seen. Endoscopic examination in the ICU showed diffuse erythema and generalized supraglottic edema affecting mostly the epiglottis and arytenoids. Dental examination demonstrated no acute pathologic features. Blood cultures at our hospital yielded no growth, and throat culture was negative for group A streptococci.

The patient recovered without requiring intubation (Figure). On the day of discharge, a blood culture from the referring hospital's emergency department was reported to be positive for Neisseria meningitidis, serogroup Y. Immediate family members and the otolaryngologists who conducted the endoscopic examination were given postexposure prophylaxis. The patient also received terminal prophylaxis. Results of a screening CH50 for terminal complement deficiency were normal.

This patient's condition is consistent with fulminant meningococcal supraglottitis. Supraglottitis implies involvement of the epiglottis and surrounding structures and is more commonly used to describe adult infection than is epiglottitis. Epiglottitis has become more common in adults than in children since the introduction of the Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine. Other organisms responsible for epiglottitis in adults include H. influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, pneumococci, Staphylococcus aureus, and group A streptococci.

Despite its propensity to colonize the upper respiratory tract, N. meningitidis has rarely been identified as a cause of supraglottitis or other deep neck infections. Only 6 cases have been reported, the first in 1995. Previously reported cases were equally apportioned by sex, and patients were 44 to 95 years of age. Including our patient, 3 of 7 were diabetic. None showed evidence of meningitis or fulminant meningococcemia, but all had fever, pharyngitis, and airway compromise. Five required airway intervention: 3 intubations and 2 urgent tracheostomies. Two received steroids, a 54-year-old man required urgent tracheostomy before receiving steroids, and a 60-year-old man's condition "deteriorated rapidly", but the report does not indicate the interval between receipt of steroids and intubation. Although steroids have been used, their benefit is unproven, and no controlled clinical trials have been conducted.

### Transoral point-of-care ultrasound in the diagnosis of parapharyngeal space abscess [^67d5a91c]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Parapharyngeal space abscesses (PPSA) are deep-space neck infections that are associated with significant morbidity and, rarely, mortality if not promptly diagnosed and treated. The diagnosis is often difficult, as the clinical presentation can mimic peritonsillar abscesses (PTA). Transoral point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) may be a useful tool to help distinguish PTAs from other deep-space infections such as PPSAs.

Case Report

A woman presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with fever, sore throat, trismus, and unilateral tonsillar swelling from a walk-in clinic with a preliminary diagnosis of PTA for drainage. A POCUS performed by the emergency medicine resident in the ED demonstrated normal tonsils. However, it revealed evidence of a PPSA. A computed tomography scan was performed, which confirmed the diagnosis. The patient was admitted to the otolaryngology service for antibiotics and steroids, with subsequent improvement and discharge home. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? In this case, the use of POCUS in the ED avoided an unnecessary invasive procedure, and facilitated the correct diagnosis of an uncommon condition.

### Corticosteroids in peritonsillar abscess treatment: a blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial [^2146c559]. The Laryngoscope (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Sore throat is a common, benign emergency department (ED) presentation; however, peritonsillar abscess (PTA) is a complication that requires aggressive management. Use of systemic corticosteroids (SCSs) in PTA is occurring without clear evidence of benefit. This study examined the efficacy and safety of SCS treatment for patients with PTA.

Study Design

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Methods

A controlled trial with concealed allocation and double-blinding was conducted at two Canadian EDs. Following written informed consent, eligible patients received 48 hours of intravenous clindamycin and a single dose of the study drug (dexamethasone [DEX] or placebo [PLAC], intravenously [IV]). Follow-up occurred at 24 hours, 48 hours, and 7 days. The primary outcome was pain; other outcomes were side effects and return to normal activities/diet.

Results

A total of 182 patients were screened for eligibility; 41 patients were enrolled (21 DEX; 20 PLAC). At 24 hours, those receiving DEX reported lower pain scores (1.4 vs. 5.1; P = 0.009); however, these differences disappeared by 48 hours (P = 0.22) and 7 days (P = 0.4). At 24 hours, more patients receiving DEX returned to normal activities (33% vs. 11%) and dietary intake (38% vs 25%); however, these differences were not significant and disappeared by 48 hours and 7 days. Side effects were rare and did not differ between groups (P > .05).

Conclusions

Combined with PTA drainage and IV antibiotics, 10 mg IV DEX resulted in less pain at 24 hours when compared to PLAC, without any serious side effects. This effect is short-lived, and further research is required on factors associated with PTA treatment success.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^9165f8f2]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Pain

In the five randomised controlled trials that reported complete resolution of symptoms at 24 hours, patients who received a single dose of corticosteroids were twice as likely to experience complete symptom resolution than placebo patients (relative risk 2.24, 95% confidence interval 1.17 to 4.29; I² = 69%, 22.4% v 10.0%; moderate quality evidence; fig 2, table 2). All studies reporting this outcome were at low risk of bias. Tests of interaction showed no evidence of any subgroup effect (table A in appendix 3).

Fig 2 Relative risk for complete resolution of pain at 24 hours for corticosteroid v placebo groups in review of treatment of sore throat. Pooled relative risk calculated by DerSimonian-Laird random effects model

In the four trials that reported complete resolution of pain at 48 hours, patients treated with corticosteroids were 50% more likely to experience complete resolution (relative risk 1.48, 95% confidence interval 1.26 to 1.75; I² = 3%, 60.8% v 42.5%; high quality; fig 3, table 2). These four studies were all at low risk of bias, and tests of interaction showed no evidence of any subgroup effect (table A in appendix 3).

Fig 3 Relative risk for complete resolution of pain at 48 hours for corticosteroid v placebo groups in review of treatment of sore throat. Pooled relative risk calculated by DerSimonian-Laird random effects model

In the eight studies that reported mean time to onset of pain relief, patients who received corticosteroids experienced onset of pain relief on average 4.8 hours earlier than those who received placebo (95% confidence interval −1.9 to −7.8; I² = 78%; moderate quality; fig 4, table 2). We found no evidence of subgroup effect for this outcome (table A in appendix 3).

### Dexamethasone [^ccb6cb33]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

General

Rare instances of anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Increased dosage of rapidly acting corticosteroids is indicated in patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to any unusual stress before, during, and after the stressful situation.

Immunosuppression and Increased Risk of Infection

Corticosteroids, including dexamethasone, suppress the immune system and increase the risk of infection with any pathogen, including viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic pathogens. Corticosteroids can:

Reduce resistance to new infections

Exacerbate existing infections

Increase the risk of disseminated infections

Increase the risk of reactivation or exacerbation of latent infections

Mask some signs of infection

Corticosteroid-associated infections can be mild but can be severe and at times fatal. The rate of infectious complications increases with increasing corticosteroid dosages.

Monitor for the development of infection and consider dexamethasone withdrawal or dosage reduction as needed.

Do not administer dexamethasone by an intraarticular, intrabursal, intratendinous, or intralesional route in the presence of acute local infection.

Tuberculosis

If dexamethasone is used to treat a condition in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, reactivation of tuberculosis may occur. Closely monitor such patients for reactivation. During prolonged dexamethasone therapy, patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity should receive chemoprophylaxis.

### A severe deep neck odontogenic infection not prioritised by the emergency department triage system and national early warning score [^f28ab8fe]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This case is illustrative of how patients can present with severe localised deep neck space infections, but with little evidence of physiological compromise even at a late stage. We hope that this will be instructive to individuals working in primary care or emergency medicine settings, and we identify a short list of 'red flag' symptoms that should prompt triage to a severe category, and urgent referral to the appropriate specialty.

The NEWS algorithm was introduced in 2012 to allow prompt recognition of acutely unwell patients, with particular emphasis on the recognition of patients with Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), a common and life-threatening complication of aggressive or inadequately treated infective processes. NEWS is now a standard tool within UK healthcare. However, in deep space infections of the head and neck, the close proximity of vital anatomical structures, in particular the larynx, means that local compressive and inflammatory effects of the disease can cause airway loss rapidly, before signs of SIRS become evident.

We propose therefore a simple addition to evaluation of patients who present with any history of potential infection in the head and neck region. Primary care, emergency medicine or nursing staff with a triage role should specifically seek and document evidence of the 'red flag' signs and symptoms demonstrated in box 1. If any of these are present, patients should be escalated to an area where close observation is possible and the appropriate specialty informed as a matter of urgency. Within the UK, this is usually the oral and maxillofacial surgery, or ear nose and throat (ENT) team, dependent on the suspected source and local protocol.

Box 1
Signs and symptoms of systemic sepsis must also be sought, but these are identified by NEWS; this list helps to identify local effects that could potentially affect the airway. NEWS, National Early Warning Score.

### Is conservative treatment of deep neck space infections appropriate? [^24a2d451]. Head & Neck (2001). Low credibility.

Background

A 31-patient prospective series on deep neck infections, managed at Hospital Ramón y Cajal in Madrid, Spain, is presented.

Methods

A prospective study was conducted from January 1994 to December 1997, including all parapharyngeal or retropharyngeal infections. Clinical and radiologic findings and length of stay in the hospital were registered. Medical treatment was instituted with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and surgery was reserved for those patients not responding to medical treatment.

Results

Twenty-four patients (77.42%) had parapharyngeal, 3 (9.68%) retropharyngeal and 4 (12.90%) mixed infections. On the basis of clinical and CT findings, 19 cases (61.29%) were considered abscesses and 12 (38.71%) cellulitis. Medical treatment was successful in all but 3 cases (90.32%), with no major complications. All the patients were discharged from the hospital within 20 days after admission (mean, 8.09 days).

Conclusions

Despite the wide use of antibiotics, deep neck space infections are commonly seen. Although most reports are based on surgical treatment followed by antibiotics, medical treatment could be as successful as open surgical drainage in most cases.
