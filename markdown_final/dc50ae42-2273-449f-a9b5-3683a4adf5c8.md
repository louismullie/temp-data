## Question

A 68-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by ambulance from a homeless shelter. The report from the shelter describes the man as a loner expressing symptoms of depression. He has been living at the shelter for approximately 10 months and has no family or friends and few visitors. He spends most of his evenings drinking alcohol and being by himself. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this patient?
A. Males are more likely to die from suicide than females.
B. Males attempt suicide more than females.
C. Females are more likely to self-inflict fatal injuries.
D. Suicide risk is highest among middle-age white women.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which statement about suicide epidemiology is most accurate for a 68-year-old man with depression and alcohol use. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the epidemiologic paradox of suicide attempts versus deaths by sex. Then, I should verify the specific risk profile for older adult males, including method lethality and alcohol use disorder. Next, I will examine each answer option against high-quality data. Finally, I will synthesize the most accurate choice and note any nuances that could change interpretation in different contexts.

> Let me first confirm the epidemiologic paradox so I don't jump to conclusions: females have higher rates of suicide attempts, but males have higher rates of suicide death, largely due to more lethal means and higher case fatality for those means, a pattern repeatedly documented in global burden studies and method-specific analyses [^117TYiKi] [^116omRTW] [^114zDUCw].

> Now, I should verify the specific risk profile for an older adult male with depression and alcohol use disorder. Wait, let me verify the alcohol–suicide link by sex: longitudinal meta-analyses show alcohol use disorder approximately doubles suicide mortality risk in both sexes, with no statistically significant difference between males and females, so AUD meaningfully elevates risk here regardless of sex [^115oaM7C] [^115Qir1a]. I also need to check method lethality: firearms and hanging have very high case fatality rates, and older adult males frequently use firearms, which magnifies risk on the first attempt; indeed, many older adults who die by suicide have no known mental health condition, underscoring the need to assess means and acute stressors in this group [^114zDUCw] [^114hSfeQ] [^115X8ygW].

> Next, I will examine Option A: "Males are more likely to die from suicide than females". Hold on, I should verify the magnitude. Global and U.S. data consistently show males account for the majority of suicide deaths, with U.S. adult male rates around 29 per 100,000 versus about 7 per 100,000 in females, and worldwide estimates similarly show markedly higher male mortality despite lower attempt rates, confirming this statement as accurate [^115R44wm] [^117TYiKi] [^116omRTW].

> I will now examine Option B: "Males attempt suicide more than females". Hmm, wait a minute, that contradicts the established paradox. Females have higher attempt rates while males have higher death rates, so this statement is incorrect on first principles and does not align with population data showing higher female attempt prevalence and higher male mortality [^117TYiKi] [^116omRTW].

> Let me consider Option C: "Females are more likely to self-inflict fatal injuries". I should double-check the directionality here. Given the higher case fatality of male-preferred methods and the higher male suicide mortality, females are not more likely to self-inflict fatal injuries; in fact, method-specific case fatality is generally higher in males even within the same method categories, so this statement is inaccurate [^112iYaEv] [^117TYiKi] [^116omRTW].

> Next, I should review Option D: "Suicide risk is highest among middle-age white women". Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check age–sex patterns. U.S. data indicate the highest female rates occur around ages 45–54, but the highest male rates occur after age 85, and globally, suicide mortality remains higher in males across the life course, so stating the highest risk is in middle-age white women is misleading for overall mortality patterns, even if it reflects a female-specific peak [^1158adiN] [^117TYiKi] [^115spr6J].

> Putting this together, the most accurate statement is Option A, which aligns with the epidemiologic paradox and the specific vulnerabilities of an older adult male with depression and alcohol use, including elevated risk via lethal means and underrecognition of mental health conditions in this demographic [^117TYiKi] [^115oaM7C] [^114hSfeQ].

---

The most accurate statement is **A. Males are more likely to die from suicide than females** [^117TYiKi]. This reflects the well-established gender paradox: males have higher suicide mortality due to more lethal methods (e.g. firearms, hanging) [^116omRTW], whereas females have higher attempt rates but lower lethality [^113Z8a4Y]. Options B and C are incorrect because females attempt suicide more often [^1174SN6h] but have lower case fatality [^112iYaEv]; option D is incorrect because the highest U.S. suicide rates are in older adult males, not middle-age white women [^1158adiN].

---

## Gender differences in suicide mortality

- **Higher male mortality**: Males consistently have higher suicide mortality rates globally [^116omRTW], largely due to more lethal methods (firearms, hanging) [^114zDUCw] and higher case fatality [^112iYaEv].

- **Female attempts**: Females have higher suicide attempt rates [^1174SN6h] but lower lethality, often using less lethal methods (e.g. poisoning, overdose) [^115WDTAm].

- **Gender paradox**: This pattern — higher male mortality despite higher female attempt rates — is a well-documented epidemiological paradox [^113Z8a4Y].

## Analysis of answer choices

| **Answer choice** | **Accuracy** | **Explanation** |
|-|-|-|
| A. Males are more likely to die from suicide than females. | Correct | Supported by global data showing higher male suicide mortality [^117TYiKi] due to more lethal methods [^116omRTW] and higher case fatality [^116omRTW]. |
| B. Males attempt suicide more than females. | Incorrect | Females have higher suicide attempt rates [^1174SN6h], though males have higher mortality [^113Z8a4Y]. |
| C. Females are more likely to self-inflict fatal injuries. | Incorrect | Females more often attempt suicide [^1174SN6h] but are less likely to die by suicide due to less lethal methods [^116omRTW]. |
| D. Suicide risk is highest among middle-age white women. | Incorrect | The highest U.S. suicide rates are in older adult males, particularly non-Hispanic white men [^1158adiN], not middle-age white women. |

## Clinical implications for the patient

Given the patient's profile — older adult male, depression, alcohol use, social isolation — his **risk is elevated** [^112Fcmuj] because older men have higher suicide mortality, especially with firearms or hanging [^114zDUCw], and alcohol use disorder further increases risk [^115oaM7C]. Social isolation and homelessness are additional risk factors [^1155YG4A]. Clinicians should assess for access to lethal means, provide safety planning, and address alcohol use and social supports to mitigate risk [^115waDJ5].

The most accurate statement is **A. Males are more likely to die from suicide than females** [^117TYiKi], reflecting higher male mortality due to more lethal methods and higher case fatality [^112iYaEv].

### Gender-specific suicide risk factors: a case-control study of individuals with major depressive disorder [^117KbYfB]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Available information on risk for suicide completion in females is limited and often extrapolated from studies conducted in males. However, the validity of extending to females risk factors identified among male suicide cases is unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate clinical and behavioral risk factors for suicide among female depressed patients and compare them to similar factors among male depressed patients.

Method

We identified 201 suicide completers (160 male and 41 female) who died during an episode of major depressive disorder (MDD). Cases were compared to 127 living patients with MDD (88 male and 39 female). All subjects were characterized for Axis I and II diagnoses using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders and Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders according to the DSM-IV, as well as behavioral and temperament dimensions using proxy-based interviews. The primary outcome was measures of impulsive and impulsive-aggressive behaviors.

Results

Compared to controls, male, but not female suicide cases had higher levels of impulsive aggression (P < .05). Nonimpulsive aggression differentiated both female (P < .05) and male (P < .01) suicide cases from controls. However, nonimpulsive aggression and impulsive aggression were correlated constructs in males (r = 0.297; P < .001), yet uncorrelated among females (r = 0.121; p = 0.390). Established risk factors for suicide, such as alcohol and substance dependence, cluster B disorders, and elevated hostility and aggression, were replicated in the pooled-sex analyses, and, though not statistically significant in discriminating between suicide cases and controls by gender, maintained strong group differences.

Conclusions

Males and females share many risk factors for suicide in MDD, yet alcohol dependence is much more specific though less sensitive among depressed females. Nonimpulsive aggression is part of a diathesis for suicide in females, which is distinct from the well-characterized impulsive aggression that is consistently reported in a portion of male suicide cases.

### Preference of lethal methods is not the only cause for higher suicide rates in males [^112iYaEv]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Background

In most countries worldwide suicide rates are higher for males whereas attempted suicide rates are higher for females. The aim is to investigate if the choice of more lethal methods by males explains gender differences in suicide rates.

Methods

Data on completed and attempted suicides were collected (n = 3235, Nuremberg and Wuerzburg, years 2000–2004). The research question was analyzed by comparing the method-specific case fatality (= completed suicides/completed+attempted suicides) for males and females.

Results

Among the events captured, men chose high-risk methods like hanging significantly more often than women (φ = -0.27; p < 0.001). However, except for drowning, case fatalities were higher for males than for females within each method. This was most apparent in "hanging" (men 83.5%, women 55.3%; φ = -0.28; p < 0.001) and "poisoning by drugs" (men 7.2%, women 3.4%; φ = -0.09; p < 0.001).

Limitations

The sample size (n = 3235) was not enough for comparing method and gender specific case fatalities with a fine-meshed stratification regarding age.

Conclusions

Higher suicide rates in males not only result from the choice of more lethal methods. Other factors have to be considered.

### Age and birth cohort-adjusted rates of suicide mortality among US male and female youths aged 10 to 19 years from 1999 to 2017 [^115y9aRc]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Valid measures are essential for evidence-based planning and decision-making in suicide prevention to control the increasing trends in suicide among youths in the United States. The suicide mortality rate, or number of suicide deaths per 100 000 individuals, has been used in describing the epidemic of suicide. Based on the unadjusted rate in the past 2 decades, suicide among US youths showed a higher and V-shaped trend for male youths and a lower and relatively smooth trend of increase for female youths, with a declining sex difference.

Despite their wide acceptance and frequent use in research and practice, the reported suicide mortality rates are very likely to be biased if used to describe time trends and sex differences. This is because the suicide mortality rate for a given year consists of 3 time-related components: chronological age, birth year (also known as birth cohort), and period when suicide occurred. Studies using the age-period-cohort (APC) modeling method have demonstrated the existence of the 3 components through empirical data. Methods to obtain an age-adjusted rate have been well established for bias correction; however, an age-standardized rate remains confounded by potential differences in the mortality of people who were born in different years. In this study, we applied a new approach to obtain age and birth cohort (age-cohort)–adjusted suicide mortality rates, capitalizing on a classic epidemiologic method of APC modeling capable of controlling the impacts of both the age and cohort.

To illustrate the new method, we used the suicide mortality rate for youths aged 10 to 15 years in 2009 as an example using hypothetical data (Figure 1). Epidemiologically, the recorded suicide mortality rate of these youths in 2009 consists of 3 independent components: (1) suicide risk associated with the chronological age of these youths by age from ages 10 years to 15 years in 2009, and the variations in the suicide risk by age, also known as age effect, which will contribute to the recorded suicide mortality in 2009; (2) suicide risk by birth cohort for youths born in 1994 (15 years ago) to 1999 (10 years ago), and variations in the suicide risk by birth cohort, also known as cohort effect, which will also contribute to the recorded suicide mortality in 2009; and (3) suicide risk in 2009 when the recorded suicide deaths occurred, also known as period effect.

Results

Tables 1 and 2 gives the number of suicide deaths and the ASR per 100,000 for the most recent available year, stratified by sex (Table 1 in males, Table 2 in females). Data are shown for the age group 75+ as well as for three age groups (i.e. 75–79, 80–84, and 85+) for the 20 selected countries worldwide, the EU-27, and the seven geographical areas.

Table 1
Number of deaths from suicide and age-standardised (world population) suicide rates (ASR) per 100,000 males, and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) at the age group 75+ years and three age groups (i.e. 75–79, 80–84, 85+) in 20 selected countries worldwide, plus the EU-27 and geographical areas, for the last available calendar year.

Table 2
Number of deaths from suicide and age-standardised (world population) suicide rates (ASR) per 100,000 females, at the age group 75+ years and three age groups (i.e. 75–79, 80–84, 85+) in 20 selected countries worldwide, plus the EU-27 and geographical areas, for the last available calendar year.

In males, considering geographical areas, the highest ASRs at age 75+ was recorded in Centre-East Europe, with a rate of 50.9 per 100,000 (95% CI: 48.1–53.7), corresponding to a total of 1,279 suicide deaths, and in West Europe, with a rate of 46.7 per 100,000 (95% CI: 45.2–48.2) and 3,855 deaths. The rate was 38.9/100,000 (95% CI: 38.0–39.9) in the EU-27, corresponding to 6,440 deaths, as well as in North America (39.0/100,000; 95% CI: 37.8–40.2), with 4,145 deaths, and 38.0/100,000 (95% CI: 36.7–39.2) in Asia and Oceania, accounting for 3,704 deaths. The lowest rate was in North Europe, at 12.8/100,000 (95% CI: 11.9–13.7), with 769 deaths.

Epidemiology and impact on the general population — In the United States (U.S.) adult population, suicide mortality increased over the first two decades of the 21st century, with 2021 showing 18.0 deaths per 100,000 population compared with an age- and sex-standardized rate of 14.2 per 100,000 in 2001. Unstandardized suicide mortality rates in 2021 ranged from 16.2 per 100,000 for those 25–29 years of age to 19.8 per 100,000 for those 60–64 years of age, and the unstandardized suicide mortality rate for males of 29.3 deaths per 100,000 far exceeded that for females of 7.0 per 100,000.

### On the genetic and environmental relationship between suicide attempt and death by suicide [^113trBr7]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The authors examined the extent to which the genetic and environmental etiology of suicide attempt and suicide death is shared or unique.

Methods

The authors used Swedish national registry data for a large cohort of twins, full siblings, and half siblings (N = 1,314,990) born between 1960 and 1990 and followed through 2015. They conducted twin-family modeling of suicide attempt and suicide death to estimate heritability for each outcome, along with genetic and environmental correlations between them. They further assessed the relationship between suicide attempt by young people compared with adults.

Results

In bivariate models, suicide attempt and death were moderately heritable among both women (attempt: additive genetic variance component [A] = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.44, 0.56; death: A = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.39, 0.59) and men (attempt: A = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.38, 0.49; death: A = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.43, 0.44). The outcomes were substantially, but incompletely, genetically correlated (women: rA = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.55, 0.67; men: rA = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.63, 0.87). Environmental correlations were weaker (women: rE = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.29, 0.45; men: rE = 0.21, 95% CI = 0.19, 0.27). Heritability of suicide attempt was stronger among people ages 10–24 (A = 0.55–0.62) than among those age 25 and older (A = 0.36–0.38), and the genetic correlation between attempt during youth and during adulthood was stronger for women (rA = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.72, 0.79) than for men (rA = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.26, 0.47).

Conclusions

The genetic and environmental etiologies of suicide attempt and death are partially overlapping, exhibit modest sex differences, and shift across the life course. These differences must be considered when developing prevention efforts and risk prediction algorithms. Where feasible, suicide attempt and death should be considered separately rather than collapsed, including in the context of gene identification efforts.

### Sex-specific and age-specific suicide mortality by method in 58 countries between 2000 and 2015 [^117UwHNA]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

The WHO mortality database is a freely available data source with national-level mortality data reported by all WHO Member States from 1979 to 2016. The database provides detailed data on the methods used in suicide, extending beyond the two cause/method groups (self-harm by firearm and self-harm by other specified means) used in the GBD database.

Using the latest WHO mortality data, therefore, we compared sex-specific and age-specific suicide mortality by method between 2000 and 2015 in all member countries covered by the WHO mortality database.

### Suicide in late life: a viewpoint [^116fkEGE]. Preventive Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Suicide in old age represents a sad public health concern. Despite the global decline in rates of suicide and the general amelioration of quality of life and access to health care for older adults, their rates of suicide remain the highest virtually in every part of the world. With the aging of the world population and the growing number of mononuclear families, the risk of an increase in isolation, loneliness and dependency does not appear ungrounded. The Covid-19 pandemic is claiming the life of many older persons and creating unprecedented conditions of distress, particularly for this segment of the population. This article briefly examines the main characteristics of suicidal behavior in late life, including observations deriving from the spread of the Sars-2 coronavirus and possible strategies for prevention.

### Individual-level risk factors for suicide mortality in the general population: an umbrella review [^112Fcmuj]. The Lancet: Public Health (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

We have presented an overview of 38 risk factors for suicide mortality reported in 33 meta-analyses based on research over five decades and have appraised the quality of the evidence. Associations should be interpreted in light of the high heterogeneity between primary studies and excess statistical significance.

A wide range of contributory factors were identified across various domains, underscoring death by suicide as a multifactorial phenomenon. By domain, we found marked differences between risk factors in their strength of association with suicide mortality. First, the strongest associations were found in the psychiatric and suicide-related domains. Large effect sizes for a previous suicide attempt and suicidal ideation support a continuum approach to suicide risk, and the relationship with parental death by suicide points to familial transmission of risk(eg, through genetic liability, social learning, or shared exposure to adverse environments). Psychiatric disorders, such as mood and psychotic disorders, increase the risk of suicide mortality approximately 10-fold, and this was supported by high-quality evidence. This finding reinforces the need to focus on these high-risk populations in primary and secondary care. Clinical guidelines should incorporate the identification, assessment, and treatment of psychiatric disorders. Psychosocial interventions following self-harm, including cognitive behavioural therapy, might reduce suicide risk. There was also an elevated risk for several physical illnesses — such as cancer and epilepsy — but at considerably lower levels of risk than for psychiatric disorders, with effect sizes of approximately two (for which the quality of evidence was not high). It is important for clinicians in primary and secondary care to consider the wider effects of physical illnesses and to liaise with mental health services to address suicide risk. Training general practitioners and health-care professionals is a promising strategy, as most individuals who die by suicide, at least in high-income settings, make contact with primary care in the year before death. More than 90% of primary studies included in the meta-analyses were from HICs, and two thirds of all meta-analyses did not include any data from LMICs, where nearly 80% of all suicide deaths worldwide occur. A better understanding of the risk factors for suicide mortality in LMICs is important to ensure that the limited resources in LMICs are effectively targeted and directed to the appropriate services and prevention interventions. If the findings by domain are replicated in LMICs, one key implication would be to improve access to mental health services in LMICs.

### Significant shared heritability underlies suicide attempt and clinically predicted probability of attempting suicide [^116zBSNv]. Molecular Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Suicide accounts for over 40,000 deaths a year in the United States alone and close to 800,000 deaths worldwide. Suicide attempt and ideation affect a much larger proportion of the population with estimates of attempts 10–25 times the number of individuals that die from suicide (1 million in the US, 20 million worldwide) and a 6–14% lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation. Despite preventative public health efforts, rates of suicidal behavior are increasing in the U.S. particularly among young adults. Epidemiological and family studies imply a substantial genetic component with estimates of the heritability of suicide behavior ranging from 17–55%. However, large-scale genetic studies remain difficult due to challenges in phenotypic ascertainment and collecting large enough samples to have the power to identify replicable genetic associations or to directly estimate the proportion of heritability contributed from common genetic variation. Thus, despite both the major public health impact and the strong evidence of heritability, the genetic architecture of suicidal behaviors remains poorly understood.

The emergence of large-scale, population-based samples where participants are phenotypically screened and genetically interrogated provides opportunities to study the genetics of phenotypes at scale. While the vast majority of individuals who attempt suicide have been diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder, the outcome is not limited to any single diagnosis. Previous work has pointed to genetic factors independent of diagnosis, which make population samples particularly valuable for the study of suicide attempt. The UK Biobank, has enrolled 500,000 individuals with extensive phenotypic and genetic data, including an online mental health assessment taken by over 157,000 participants. In this assessment, participants reported self-harm behaviors and specifically whether they have ever attempted suicide with the intent to end their lives. Among those questioned, over 3000 participants responded "yes", providing a large set of suicide attempt cases with genetic data currently available and a corresponding set of population matched controls.

### Prevalence and correlates of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in preadolescent children: a US population-based study [^115QfKxP]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Data from this nationally representative sample indicate that in preadolescent youth, a lifetime history of suicidal ideation is alarmingly common with suicide attempts more rare, but still of critical concern. The high rates of suicidal ideation and even suicide attempts in this preadolescent sample underscore the need to clarify predictors of suicide risk in children, and in particular, to examine predictors that differentiate children who experience a suicide attempt from those with suicidal ideation. The present study offers unique insight into the predictors of pure suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among preadolescent children in the United States.

Relative to males, females exhibited a lower likelihood of suicidal ideation, but sex was not a significant predictor of suicide attempts. Although rates of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts are consistently higher among female adolescents than male peers, this does not appear to be the case in preadolescent children. Prior research with youth in this age group has been mixed regarding sex differences in suicidal ideation with some studies finding females to be more likely to experience suicidal ideation than males and other studies documenting higher rates of suicidal ideation among males than females. In terms of sex differences in suicide attempts, our finding that sex was not associated with having made a suicide attempt is consistent with past research suggesting that sex differences in suicide attempts are not apparent in preadolescent children and may not emerge until adolescence. Our study adds new data from a large, nationally representative sample that emphasizes the need to not overlook the possibility of suicidal ideation in young males. For these males, such early onset of suicidal ideation could be an especially important risk factor for future suicidal behavior, and insofar as early onset of psychopathology is associated with a more severe course, it is possible that they may be highly represented in the group of males who eventually die by suicide. Following preadolescent males with suicidal ideation into later waves of ABCD data will be especially important for better understanding if onset of suicidal ideation at this age, when compared to later onset, is indeed associated with an especially poor long-term prognosis in adolescence and adulthood.

### Global trends in youth suicide from 1990 to 2020: an analysis of data from the WHO mortality database [^114DwvME]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Heterogeneous patterns emerged across countries (Fig. 3 and Table S6). Among European countries, France, Germany and Russia showed the most marked declines in suicide rates over the studied period. In Italy, after an early rise until 1996, male rates steeply decreased until 2006 remaining stable thereafter, while they steadily declined over the whole studied period among females. Of note, increasing trends were observed in the UK, with an estimated APC of +2.5% (95% CI: [1.6, 3.5]) since 2005 until 2020 among males and +8.5% [4.7, 12.6] since 2012 among females. Similarly, suicide rates substantially increased in Brazil (+7.3% [4.0, 10.6] since 2016 among males and +9.4% [6.7, 12.1] since 2014 among females), in the USA (+3.8% [3.1, 4.5] since 2009 among males and +6.7% [5.6, 7.8] in 2007–2017 among females), in the Republic of Korea (+16.7% [7.7, 26.4] since 2015 among females) and in Australia (+3.8% [2.4, 5.2] since 2009 among males). In Japan, opposing trends between males (decrease) and females (increase) were observed over most recent years.

Fig. 3
Suicide trends (age 10–24 years) derived by joinpoint regression models from 1990 to 2021 or the most recent available year, in the 18 selected major countries worldwide, in men (solid dot) and females (empty dot) separately, with country-specific scales.

Fig. 4 shows the percentage of deaths by suicide method (out of the overall suicides), by sex separately, registered in the most recent available year, in 12 selected major countries worldwide with available information. Hanging, strangulation, and suffocation, although with different proportions across countries (45–92% among males, 36–91% among females), were the most common methods of suicide in all countries for both males and females, with the exception of the USA, where firearm discharge and explosives were the most frequent means of suicide among males. A higher proportion of suicides by poisoning among females compared to males was observed in all countries.

### Living alone, loneliness and lack of emotional support as predictors of suicide and self-harm: a nine-year follow up of the UK biobank cohort [^1155YG4A]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusions

This study raises several questions for future exploration. Our results suggest that addressing loneliness in the general population may reduce the risk of self-harm but, for death by suicide, there is a much more complex (and likely sex-specific) relationship between loneliness, living arrangements and perceived emotional support. Overall, this work demonstrates that for men (but not for women) living alone or with a non-partner is associated with increased risk of suicide, a finding not explained by perceived loneliness. It appears likely that loneliness may be more important as a risk factor for self-harm than for suicide. These findings may reflect differences in the theoretical pathways for death by suicide and self-harm.

### Sex-specific and age-specific suicide mortality by method in 58 countries between 2000 and 2015 [^117TTwUb]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Substantial suicide mortality decreases occurred between 2000 and 2015 in 37 of the 58 countries (64%) included in this study. The suicide spectrum by method experienced substantial changes in several countries, likely reflecting combined influences of changes in population sociodemographic characteristics and organised suicide prevention efforts. Results amplify calls for further research to explore specific drivers of the observed changes, including especially the increases in suicide rates we witnessed in eight countries, and to understand disparities in suicide rates across countries. Results also amplify urgent need to continue global suicide prevention efforts.

### Changes in suicide rates-United States, 2018–2019 [^1169KnFf]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

Suicide rates in 2019 were lowest in large central metropolitan areas (11.2 per 100,000) and increased as the level of urbanization declined, with noncore (nonmetropolitan) areas having the highest rate (20.1 per 100,000); this stepped pattern occurred among both females and males. Rates declined from 2018 to 2019 in two county urbanization levels: large fringe metropolitan (3.1%) and micropolitan (nonmetropolitan) (5.7%). Rates also declined among females in micropolitan (nonmetropolitan) areas.

In 2019, the largest proportion of suicides occurred by use of firearms (50.4%), with a rate of 6.8 per 100,000. Whereas males were most likely to die from a firearm-related injury (55.6%) females were equally likely to die from firearm use (31.4%), poisoning (30.0%), and suffocation (e.g. hanging) (29.0%). The rate of firearm suicides declined significantly from 2018 to 2019, by 2.9% (from 7.0 to 6.8 per 100,000), overall, likely driven by a 2.4% decline in their use among males (from 12.6 to 12.3 per 100,000); the rate of firearm suicide among females did not change. The rate of suicide by suffocation among females decreased significantly (10.0%; from 2.0 to 1.8 per 100,000). Rates of suicide by all other mechanisms did not change significantly overall or among females or males.

Firearms were the most common mechanism of suicide in 2019 in all county urbanization levels (Figure 1). The percentage of suicides by firearm in 2019 increased in a stepped pattern from the most urban counties (41.7%) to the most rural (i.e. least urban) counties (62.5%). Conversely, suffocation, the second most prevalent mechanism of suicide, followed a largely stepped decrease from most urban (31.4%) to least urban (28.5%) counties; suicides by poisoning followed a similar pattern, from 14.5% (most urban) to 12.9% (least urban).

Still, our findings have important public health implications. Taking into account gender-specific characteristics and geographical disparities, they can help and guide policymakers to create targeted preventive programs and interventions to address specific needs of vulnerable groups. In fact, for example, previous studies suggested common and gender-specific risk factors for suicidal behaviour in adolescents and young adults. However, further evidence is needed. Community-based approaches and educational settings, such as schools, can provide a road for implementing suicide prevention interventions. A large number of young people can be reached in order to provide them the necessary knowledge and skills to recognize mental health issues and seek help.

In addition, it is crucial to monitor the COVID-19 long-term effects with particular regard to mental health, and possible impact on suicide rates. Experiencing prolonged isolation and loneliness is a risk factor for mental health worsening, and it may contribute to increased vulnerability to suicidal ideation and related behaviours. Evidence exists about a worsening in mental health indicators due to the pandemic effects among children and adolescents as well as young adults. The pandemic also caused an infodemic, characterized by an excess of information, including false and misleading content, which has created consequently a sense of overwhelming and uncertainty. Monitoring and addressing the long-term mental health consequences of the pandemic are essential to ensure the well-being of individuals and prevent future evolutions of mental health issues.

In conclusion, geographical heterogeneity in suicide mortality patterns among young individuals and the worrying upward trends in some countries highlight the importance of addressing this complex issue, on a global scale, with a multidisciplinary approach. Additional research and international collaborations are needed to understand the underlying factors, including socioeconomic and familial contexts. It is important to promote social activities and reinforce affective relationships, especially between peers, and mental health awareness. Early detection and tailored interventions are crucial in mitigating suicide risk while reinforcing assistance to the affected children, adolescents, and their families.

### Individual-level risk factors for suicide mortality in the general population: an umbrella review [^116HBbX3]. The Lancet: Public Health (2023). High credibility.

Search strategy and selection criteria

We did a keyword search of titles and abstracts in five electronic databases (Web of Science, PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, and Global Health) for meta-analyses published from database inception to Aug 31, 2022. The same search string was used for each database: (suicid*) AND (meta-analy* OR meta-rev* OR meta-reg* OR meta-syn*). We used forward and backward citation chaining to supplement our search, and reference lists of relevant reviews were manually searched. Targeted searches were also conducted to identify specific risk factors not identified in the main search.

Eligible studies were systematic reviews with meta-analysis of observational studies that examined individual-level risk factors for suicide mortality in the general population and provided a pooled effect size for the association between a risk factor and suicide mortality. Systematic reviews without meta-analysis were excluded as we intended to provide quantitative comparisons and test quality. We did not consider meta-analyses that only reported on prevalence or incidence rates (rather than associations). Eligibility was assessed by LF and discussed with SF.

Suicide mortality was the outcome of interest. Meta-analyses of risk factors for suicide attempt or self-harm were not included because associations have been shown to differ by outcome. Clear examples include age and sex, for which associations are different for suicide mortality compared with non-fatal suicidal behaviour. When meta-analyses examined the association between a given risk factor and multiple suicide-related outcomes (commonly ideation, attempt, and death), we only included the data specifically relating to suicide mortality (although in a secondary analysis, we compared effect sizes for these different outcomes when reported in the same meta-analysis). Reviews that solely focused on suicide deaths by a specific method (eg, hanging, poisoning, or firearms) were excluded because these are differentially associated with specific demographic and clinical factors, which would limit generalisability (eg, compared with other methods, people who die by firearms are less likely to have a history of suicide attempts or mental illness).

### Alcohol consumption per capita and suicide: a meta-analysis [^112445Rs]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Before we can draw any such conclusions, the risk association between APC and suicide mortality rates should be established. Existing literature reviews examining the relationship in question are either outdated, and/or have a limited geographic scope, and to our knowledge, no meta-analysis currently exists for this association. Additionally, existing studies do not typically conduct formal tests for sex differences, instead relying on a theoretical basis to justify any observed differences. Therefore, the objective of the current study was 2-fold: (1) determine whether there is an association between APC and suicide mortality and (2) if there is a relationship, determine whether it differs by sex.

### Sex-specific and age-specific suicide mortality by method in 58 countries between 2000 and 2015 [^111AoAVH]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To examine recent changes in sex-specific and age-specific suicide mortality by method across countries.

Methods

Using mortality data from the WHO mortality database, we compared sex-specific, age-specific and country-specific suicide mortality by method between 2000 and 2015. We considered seven major suicide methods: poisoning by pesticides, all other poisoning, firearms and explosives, hanging, jumping from height, drowning and other methods. Changes in suicide mortality were quantified using negative binomial models among three age groups (15–44 years, 45–64 years, and 65 years and above) for males and females separately.

Results

Suicide mortality declined substantially for both sexes and all three age groups studied in 37 of the 58 included countries between 2000 and 2015. Males consistently had much higher suicide mortality rates than females in all 58 countries. Hanging was the most common suicide method in the majority of 58 countries. Sex-specific suicide mortality varied across 58 countries significantly for all three age groups. The spectrum of suicide method generally remained stable for 28 of 58 included countries; notable changes occurred in the other 30 countries, including especially Colombia, Finland and Trinidad and Tobago.

Conclusion

Likely as a result of prevention efforts as well as sociodemographic changes, suicide mortality decreased substantially in 37 of the included 58 countries between 2000 and 2015. Further actions are needed to explore specific drivers of the recent changes (particularly for increases in eight countries), to understand substantial disparities in suicide rates across countries, and to develop interventions to reduce suicide rates globally.

### Notes from the field: suicidal thoughts and knowing someone who died by suicide among adults-United States, 2023 [^1134UPp5]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

Suicide is a leading cause of death in the United States with approximately 49,000 deaths in 2023, and many more persons seriously think about suicide. Timely data on suicidal thoughts and knowing someone who died by suicide, which can increase one's risk for suicide, can guide public health planning and interventions.

### Sex differences in life-course suicide rates by state firearm policy environment [^1142Ujn2]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Male sex and permissive state firearm policy environments have been independently associated with suicide mortality. Few recent studies quantify how these factors interact, or how interactions vary across the life course. This study investigates how state firearm policy environments moderate sex differences in firearm, non-firearm, and overall suicide rates across the life course.

Methods

Employing Center for Disease Control and Prevention data, linear regression was used to model sex differences in firearm, non-firearm, and total suicide mortality rates per 100,000 across the life course and interactions with state firearm policy environments (categorized "permissive" versus "strict" using Giffords Gun Law Scorecard Grades). Data were collected in 2018–2022 and analyzed in 2024–2025.

Results

Across all ages and state policy environments, male sex was associated with higher firearm (18.95; 95%CI, 16.97,20.92), non-firearm (7.07; 95%CI, 6.63,7.14), and total (26.02; 95%CI, 23.94,28.10) suicide rates. Compared to strict state policy environments, permissive environments were associated with increased firearm (5.84; 95%CI, 3.84,7.84) and total suicide rates (5.96; 95%CI, 3.32,8.60). In interacted models, permissive environments augmented associations of male sex with higher firearm (9.02; 95%CI, 5.75,12.29) and total (9.24; 95%CI, 5.96,12.52) suicide rates. Sex also moderated associations of age with suicide rates.

Conclusions

Males die from suicide at higher rates than females across the life course, exhibiting particularly high rates within states that implement permissive firearm policies. At older ages, dramatically higher male suicide rates are seen in both permissive and strict state environments, suggesting that males face unique challenges associated with aging that require focused clinical attention.

### Sex-specific association of alcohol use disorder with suicide mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112VLfom]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Does alcohol use disorder (AUD) have a sex-specific association with suicide mortality?

Findings

This systematic review and meta-analysis found that sex differences in the association of AUD with suicide mortality were a function of bias introduced by the study design. Among longitudinal studies, both sexes with AUD had statistically significantly higher odds of dying by suicide compared with their counterparts without AUD.

Meaning

Alcohol use disorder is associated with similar heightened odds of suicide mortality for males and females, underscoring the need for simple routine screening measures that could have an important impact in terms of lives saved.

### Sex-specific association of alcohol use disorder with suicide mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114u61ev]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

It is important to point out that the current study represents the association between one of the predisposing dimensions of alcohol use and suicide mortality. Although not necessarily distinct, the association between average daily amount of alcohol consumed per day and suicide and the shape of the dose-response curve remain largely unknown. Moreover, it is not clear whether the association between AUD and suicide mortality risk is due to the physiological effects of alcohol, the adverse social, occupational, or health consequences that go along with an AUD diagnosis, or both. It is possible that the lack of difference between the sexes in the focal relationship under investigation when longitudinal study designs are considered alone is that the long-term consequences of AUD (ie, the adverse social, occupational, or health consequences) are equally detrimental to males and females. It is also possible that the cross-sectional studies are capturing more of the physiological effects of alcohol, which are known to differ by sex, and this is reflected in the sex differences observed when cross-sectional study designs are considered alone.

In the present study, the term sex has been used throughout. This was used as the outcome of interest is a mortality outcome, typically ascertained via official statistics or death report data. With such data, biological sex is discerned and documented. However, the role of gender and more specifically gender-related factors (eg, social norms surrounding both alcohol use and suicide) should not be overlooked, nor should the terms sex and gender be conflated (as is a possibility in some on the studies included herein). Further, research suggests that members of sexual minority groups experience a higher prevalence of comorbid depression, suicidality, and substance use. Such findings highlight the need for research on the association between AUD and suicide mortality among this specific population, a population not covered in the present study.

### Does the level of education influence completed suicide? A nationwide register study [^116XvTee]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate whether education attainment was associated with completed suicide, a topic only marginally investigated in the literature.

Methods

Data for the years between 2006 and 2008 were extracted from the Italian Mortality Database to include all deaths by suicide and natural causes and to obtain information on their education attainment.

Results

We found significant differences in education attainment between suicide victims and individuals deceased by natural causes, stratified by sex and broken down by age bands. Of both males and females from 15 to 64 years old, suicide victims were significantly more often to have a higher education attainment compared with the same sex and age counterparts died from natural causes. Persons with higher school attainment, compared with those with a maximum primary school degree, had significantly increased odds ratios of dying from a suicide rather than a natural cause. For persons aged 65–74 years or above, however, the differences were not so much obvious. These observations remained almost the same after adjustment for marital status, region of residence and age.

Conclusions

Individual with higher educational achievement may be more prone to suicide risk when facing failures, public shame, and high premorbid functioning.

### Self-harm events and suicide deaths among autistic individuals in Ontario, Canada [^113CshZp]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Autistic individuals experience higher mortality than nonautistic individuals across natural and unnatural causes. Among potentially preventable causes, suicide death and precursory self-harm eventsoccur at higher rates among autistic individuals than nonautistic individuals. Meta-analyses show that autistic individuals have over 3-fold greater odds than nonautistic individuals of experiencing self-injurious behavior, suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, or suicide death. One-fourth of autistic young people experience suicidal ideation and 8.3% experience suicide attempts.

Reasons for increased suicide risks among autistic people are unclear. Reported risk factors include adverse childhood experiences, poor social connection, and psychiatric illnesses (eg, depression and psychosis). High heterogeneity and inconsistent demographic correlates across studies, suggest that rates of suicide-related events and, potentially, rates and kinds of suicide risk and protective factors, vary across demographics and jurisdictions. Population-based studies offer critical insights about suicide risks among autistic people and region-specific variations by sociocultural and health systems factors. So far, there are only a small number of such studies, from the US, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Taiwan, and the UK.

Suicide risk patterns can be sex-specific, with males more likely to die by suicide than females, and females experiencing more self-harm, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts than males. Among autistic individuals, recent Scandinavian and US population-based studies found that female sex assigned at birth (hereafter referred to as sex) is associated with greater self-harm events and suicidality overall, although studies in other countries or with more confined age groups did not observe this trend. This pattern implies unique modulation regarding suicide risks by sex-related factors (eg, differences in vulnerability to psychiatric illnesses)and/or gender-related factors (eg, gender diversity status)among autistic people. Simply adjusting for sex (or gender), but not considering stratification, in investigating suicide risks among autistic peoplemight miss mechanistic insights. Sex stratification is essential to unveil unique suicide risks among autistic individuals, especially because females have been underrepresented in autism research for decades.

### Individual-level risk factors for suicide mortality in the general population: an umbrella review [^116oTFLJ]. The Lancet: Public Health (2023). High credibility.

Background

Deaths by suicide remain a major public health challenge worldwide. Identifying and targeting risk factors for suicide mortality is a potential approach to prevention. We aimed to summarise current knowledge on the range and magnitude of individual-level risk factors for suicide mortality in the general population and evaluate the quality of the evidence.

Methods

In this umbrella review, five bibliographic databases were systematically searched for articles published from database inception to Aug 31, 2022. We included meta-analyses of observational studies on individual-level risk factors for suicide mortality in the general population. Biological, genetic, perinatal, and ecological risk factors were beyond the scope of this study. Effect sizes were synthesised and compared across domains. To test robustness and consistency of the findings, evidence for small-study effects and excess significance bias (ie, the ratio between the overall meta-analysis effect size and that of its largest included study) was examined, and prediction intervals were calculated. Risk of bias was assessed by the Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews instrument. The protocol was pre-registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021230119).

Findings

We identified 33 meta-analyses on 38 risk factors for suicide mortality in the general population. 422 (93%) of the 454 primary studies included in the meta-analyses were from high-income countries. A previous suicide attempt and suicidal ideation emerged as strong risk factors (with effect sizes ranging from 6 to 16). Psychiatric disorders were associated with a greatly elevated risk of suicide mortality, with risk ratios in the range of 4–13. Suicide risk for physical illnesses (such as cancer and epilepsy) and sociodemographic factors (including unemployment and low education) were typically increased two-fold. Contact with the criminal justice system, state care in childhood, access to firearms, and parental death by suicide also increased the risk of suicide mortality. Among risk factors for which sex-stratified analyses were available, associations were generally similar for males and females. However, the quality of the evidence was limited by excess significance and high heterogeneity, and prediction intervals suggested poor replicability for almost two-thirds of identified risk factors.

Interpretation

A wide range of risk factors were identified across various domains, which underscores suicide mortality as a multifactorial phenomenon. Prevention strategies that span individual and population approaches should account for the identified factors and their relative strengths. Despite the large number of risk factors investigated, few associations were supported by robust evidence. Evidence of causal inference will need to be tested in high-quality study designs.

### Sex-specific and age-specific suicide mortality by method in 58 countries between 2000 and 2015 [^114moi2k]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Suicide is a significant public health problem internationally and is responsible for over 793 800 deaths in 2017 according to estimates from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study group. Although suicide mortality varies substantially by sex and age group and across regions and countries, suicide places among the top three causes of death for people aged 15–44 years in several countries. The United Nations lists suicide prevention as a specific target in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), 'reducing by one-third premature mortality from non-communicable diseases by 2030 (including suicide)'.

In the past few decades, successful suicide prevention measures have been developed in many countries to reduce self-harm and suicide. Implemented strategies include improved access to mental health and welfare services, reduced use of alcohol and promotion of responsible media reporting about suicide. Perhaps the most successful suicide prevention strategy, however, is restricting access to lethal means. This prevention strategy has been widely promoted to prevent suicide by international organisations such as WHO and the UNICEF, individual governments, non-government organisations, as well as injury researchers in the last decade.

In order to best promote efforts to prevent suicide, including by restricting access to lethal means, it is important to understand the patterns of sex-specific and age-specific suicide mortality by method across individual countries around the world. Previous research offers some indication of these patterns. One publication, for example, reported varying spectrums of suicide methods and method-specific suicide mortality across sex, age groups, and regions and countries before 2005, revealing hanging as the predominant method of suicide in most countries and firearms suicide in the USA. In addition, a few studies report suicide mortality patterns for specific suicide methods among certain age groups in a single nation or region. As an example, one study reported that firearm suicide mortality decreased globally from 1990 to 2016. Another study on suicide by charcoal burning showed that charcoal-burning suicide mortality increased significantly in some East/Southeast Asian countries/territories in the first decade of the 21st century. No published study examines, however, recent changes within countries across the world in sex-specific and age-specific suicide mortality by method. Since epidemiological characteristics may change as the result of prevention efforts and socioeconomic development, this knowledge would be valuable for prevention planning by a range of stakeholders.

### Assessment and management of patients at risk for suicide: synopsis of the 2024 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guidelines [^1169NMtk]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

U.S. adult suicide mechanisms and non-fatal self-harm — In 2021, more than one-half (55.0%) of adult suicide deaths involved a firearm, with firearms the most common single mechanism among males (59.9%) followed by suffocation (24.9%), while among females firearm (35.3%), suffocation (26.5%), and drug poisoning (25.4%) were most common. Non-fatal self-harm surveillance from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention emergency department probability sample indicates the rate among adults age 18 or older was 133.1 per 100,000 in 2021; after standardization, females had a higher rate than males (144.5 and 122.4 per 100,000, respectively). Rates were highest for adults under 30 years and decreased with increasing age, with approximately one-half of non-fatal self-harm events involving poisoning (47.2%) and cutting or piercing the second most common mechanism (28.2%); poisoning was more frequent among females than males (52.7% versus 40.7%).

### Cause-specific excess mortality in suicidal patients: gender differences in mortality patterns [^116HCc6j]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Few studies have investigated gender-specific excess mortality in suicidal patients. The objective of this study was to examine the risk of dying from all causes of death in male and female suicidal patients.

Method

This study included 4140 patients who received psychiatric treatment in two Austrian hospitals after non-fatal suicidal behavior between 1989 and 2001. Mortality was prospectively assessed for a maximum follow-up period of 17 years (1989–2005). Gender-specific standardized mortality ratios were calculated for all causes of death. Rate ratios were used to assess gender differences.

Results

Males but not females had an elevated risk to die from "natural" causes of death. Mortality from "unnatural" causes of death, particularly suicide, was elevated in both genders. The female suicide risk markedly exceeded the risk for males. In both genders, mortality caused by substance use disorders was considerably elevated.

Conclusion

Significant gender differences in the excess mortality of suicidal patients underline the need for gender-specific research in psychiatry.

### Suicide methods in Europe: a gender-specific analysis of countries participating in the "European alliance against depression" [^115WDTAm]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2008). Low credibility.

To test the reliability of data obtained by EAAD partner countries, male and female suicide numbers were compared to WHO data in the European Mortality Database. There was agreement between the WHO data and the EAAD compiled data in Estonia, Finland, Germany, Hungary, The Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain. For cites where a region, rather than the whole country was studied (Belgium, Italy, England and Scotland), data were not comparable with WHO data. There were some notable differences between EAAD and WHO data. The EAAD data for Ireland was 8.5% and for Luxembourg 1.8% higher than the WHO data. In contrast, the EAAD data from Iceland and Switzerland were lower — 2.9% and 0.5% respectively.

Male and female suicide methods

Although completed suicide rates are generally much higher in men than in women with the exception of some Asian countries, – there are more suicide attempts registered for females by the WHO/EURO Multicentre Study in most of the participating countries, and much more diagnosed depression in women relative to men. This gender paradox calls into question the possible reasons for different prevalence rates in male-female completed suicides.

Several studies have addressed the issue of different patterns of methods used in male and female suicide populations as the primary reason for gender differences in suicide mortality. Traditionally, women have selected suicide methods that are less lethal and men have chosen techniques that are more violent and whose consequences are irreversible.–

Spicer et al revealed that firearms, drowning and suffocation/hanging were the most lethal methods and drug overdose/poison ingestion and cutting/piercing were the least lethal methods. In Card's classification, in addition to the above mentioned methods jumping from a high place and jumping in front of a moving object were added to the highly lethal methods. Card qualified the use of fire as a less lethal suicide method.

### Firearms: the leading cause of years of potential life lost [^116m9eaN]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Firearm death: populations affected

Males comprised the majority of the 38 929 firearm deaths reported by the CDC in 2018 with 33 258 deaths (85.4%). Firearm suicide was highest among white males in 2018 comprising 49.3% of total firearm deaths, whereas firearm homicide was highest in the black male population, comprising 18.3% of total firearm deaths. During the 10-year period, white males had a total of 4.95 million YPLL due to firearm suicide compared with 1.7 million YPLL due to firearm homicide (figure 4). Middle-aged and older white males had significantly higher rates of firearm suicide, with 30 774 deaths in the age group 45–54 years, 31 092 deaths in the age group 55–64 years, and 46 078 deaths in the 65 years and older age group during the course of the 10-year period. The total number of deaths from firearm suicide for white males under the age of 45 years was 62 430 during the same period — 46% less than those 45 years and older. The 4.95 million YPLL due to firearm suicide in white males represent over one-third of all YPLL related to firearm deaths. The APC of white male suicides during the study period was 0.43 (p = 0.001).

Black males had a total of 3.2 million YPLL due to firearm homicides compared with 0.4 million YPLL due to firearm suicide during the study period (figure 5). There were a total of 63 414 firearm homicide deaths, with the majority of firearm homicide deaths in the 15–24 (24 601 deaths) and 25–34 (21 599 deaths) age groups. The APC of black male suicides during the 10-year period was 0.79 (p < 0.001).

### Global, regional, and national burden of suicide, 1990–2021: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2021 [^117Q1atB]. The Lancet: Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Suicide mortality

Suicide mortality data preparation requires an abundance of caution due to the sensitivity of the subject and stigma associated with suicide in many cultures. Some deaths recorded on death certificates do not include ICD codes that fall under a range of codes that belong to a GBD cause, such as those mentioned above, and therefore cannot be directly assigned to a cause of death in the GBD cause hierarchy. Within the GBD framework, these are codes that are used to classify causes of death or morbidity that are either too vague, non-specific, or do not accurately represent a true underlying cause of death or disease. According to previously described methods of redistribution, we identified cases of misassignment of suicide and reassigned those to this cause by age, sex, location, and year based on multiple causes of death data (data for which additional cause-of-death codes other than the underlying cause of death are listed) and other statistical analyses. In 2015, in the raw data, there were 303 541 deaths directly assigned to suicide in ICD-9 and ICD-10 vital registration sources. During the redistribution process, 75 149 (25%) deaths were added to these estimates. 82% of deaths that were added to suicide estimates during code redistribution came from ICD codes Y10–Y34, undetermined intent (appendix 1 p 14). Redistribution of deaths assigned to ICD codes Y10–Y33 used a regression method, and deaths assigned to Y34 used a separate method using multiple causes of death data. The strategies for producing redistribution weights for Y10–Y33 and Y34 have been described previously.

Estimation models for suicide used data acquired from vital registration, verbal autopsy, and mortality surveillance, including 23 782 study-location-years of data in GBD 2021. After data were redistributed as necessary, estimates for suicide were modelled exclusively using the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm), which is a Bayesian hierarchical spatiotemporal ensemble modelling tool used to estimate causes with continuous, predictable mortality. In addition to observed datapoints, covariates were included to estimate location-years without data (appendix 1 pp 21–22).

We used the GBD standard-population structure to estimate age-standardised mortality rates per 100 000 population. Point estimates were calculated from the average of 1000 randomly selected possible values of deaths from suicide by age, sex, and geographical location. 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) were derived from the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles from a 1000-draw distribution.

### Global, regional, and national burden of suicide, 1990–2021: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2021 [^11119hVy]. The Lancet: Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Calculation of mean age of death

Calculation of mean age at the time of death from suicide was done using GBD modelled death estimates. GBD produces cause-of-death estimates for every location-year-age group, even when there are no direct cause-of-death data available. GBD uses standard 5-year age groups from 5–9 years to 90–94 years; the remaining non-standard age groups consist of ages 0–6 days, 7–27 days, 1–5 months, 6–11 months, 12–23 months, 2–4 years, and 95 years and older. For this calculation, each GBD age group is assigned a distinct age of death by taking the average age of each age group. For example, the age group 15–19 years can be assigned to have a distinct age of death of 17 years old. The only age group without a discernable average is 95 years and older, which was assigned a distinct age of 95 years.

In GBD estimates, each modelled death falls into one of these age groups and can be assigned a distinct age of death. Distinct ages are then summed together for a given demographic consisting of a given location-year-sex-cause. This value is then divided by the total number of deaths for the same demographic to quantify the mean age of death.

Calculation of custom age ranges

To produce custom age groups, multiple years were aggregated together to decrease sensitivity to variations from year to year in smaller countries. For a given age group, the total deaths over the past 5 years were summed together and divided by the sum of the population over the past 5 years. This value was then multiplied by 100 000 to produce mortality rates per 100 000. Five custom age groups were calculated (10–29, 30–49, 50–69, and ≥ 70 years).

### Physician death by suicide in the United States: 2012–2016 [^112MiS1u]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Reports of incidence of physician suicide in the United States (US) are outdated. The aims of this research were to assess incidence, methods, and associated risk factors of physicians compared to non-physicians in the general US population. Retrospective suicide data (victim age 25 and over) from the 2012–2016 National Violent Death Reporting System were analyzed to test for differences in rates, methods, and risk factors of male and female physicians to non-physicians. The dataset included 498 physician suicides (403 males and 95 females) and 74,420 non-physicians (57,188 males and 17,232 females). No significant difference was found in suicide incidence between gender and age-adjusted physicians vs. non-physicians, though the female physician rate of suicide appeared higher than female non-physicians. The male to female physician ratio of suicide was about 2:1, whereas the ratio in non-physicians was closer to 4:1. Female physicians used poisoning and hanging most often as a method of suicide, where males used firearms. Depressed mood (as perceived by self or others), mental health problems (defined by a diagnosis of depression, a prescribed antidepressants or toxicology report of antidepressants), poor general medical health, and work-related stressors were more frequently associated with physician than with non-physician suicides. In conclusion, results suggest a possible heightened risk to female physicians, which warrants further investigation. Several physician-specific modifiable suicide risk factors present opportunities for prevention.

### Sex differences in suicide mortality among Vietnam war-era veterans 1979–2019: a cohort study [^1127db9e]. BMJ Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

There are also compelling reasons to suspect that the association between Vietnam deployment and postwar suicide risk among VWEVs might vary by sex. For example, post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a salient risk factor for suicide among VWEVs. Prior research documents sex differences in the 'pathway to PTSD' among deployed VWEVs, with warzone stressors being more strongly linked to PTSD risk in males (who assumed formal combat roles) than females (who were not assigned formal roles and worked primarily as warzone nurses). Postwar support may mitigate risk for PTSD in VWEVs. However, such support was a scarcity for the female theatre veterans of this cohort — who commonly received a hostile reception on returning home and little acknowledgement of their military experiences and sacrifices. Moreover, their access to appropriate, veteran-centric health and mental healthcare after the war was quite limited compared with that of their male counterparts. This lack of appropriate postwar support has been associated with increased risk of PTSD among FVWEVs. Given this prior literature, questions about broader sex-based differences in the association of Vietnam deployment and mental health outcomes (eg, suicide) warrant attention.

No study to date has comprehensively examined sex differences in the association of Vietnam deployment and postwar suicide mortality among VWEVs. The present study employs the rich data resources of the Vietnam Era Veterans Mortality Study database, which includes mortality data for the universe of all US VWEVs, to evaluate sex differences in suicide mortality risk across 41 years post war (1979–2019). Study objectives include examination of: (1) baseline statistics on suicide by sex and theatre deployment status among all VWEVs and (2) adjusted associations between suicide mortality (all suicide deaths, method-specific suicide deaths), sex, and theatre deployment status, as well as (3) calculation of suicide risk among VWEVs, stratified by sex and theatre deployment status, compared with the expected risk for the US general population using a cumulative stratified assessment of suicide mortality risk across calendar years (1979–2019).

### Sex-specific association of alcohol use disorder with suicide mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115oaM7C]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Despite individual studies suggesting that sex differences exist in the association between alcohol use disorder (AUD) and suicide, most existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses have reported associations across the sexes.

Objective

To estimate the sex-specific association between AUD and suicide mortality.

Data Sources

Embase, MEDLINE (including MEDLINE In-Process), PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science were searched from database inception to April 27, 2022.

Study Selection

Inclusion criteria consisted of the following: (1) original, quantitative study, (2) inclusion of a measure of association and its corresponding measure of variability (or sufficient data to calculate these [eg, 95% CI]), and (3) results stratified by sex.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data extraction was completed by one reviewer and then cross-checked by a second reviewer. Risk of bias was assessed by study design. Categorical random-effects meta-analyses were conducted to obtain sex-specific pooled estimates of the association between AUD and suicide mortality risk. Methodological moderators (ie, study design and comparator group) were assessed using sex-stratified meta-regressions.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The association between AUD and suicide mortality.

Results

A total of 16 347 unique records were identified in the systematic search; 24 studies were ultimately included for 37 870 699 participants (59.7% male and 40.3% female) (23 risk estimates for male and 17 for female participants). Participants ranged in age from 15 years to 65 years or older. Sex-specific meta-regression models indicated that study design (ie, longitudinal vs cross-sectional study design) affected the observed association between AUD and suicide mortality for both male participants (log odds ratio, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.08–1.28]; p = 0.03) and female participants (log odds ratio, 1.41 [95% CI, 0.57–2.24]; P < .001). For males and females, among longitudinal studies, the pooled odds ratios were 2.68 (95% CI, 1.86–3.87; I2 = 99% [n = 14]) and 2.39 (95% CI, 1.50–3.81; I2 = 90% [n = 11]), respectively.

Conclusions and Relevance

This systematic review and meta-analysis yielded substantive evidence that AUD was associated with suicide mortality and that the association was similar across the sexes. The findings underscore the importance of identifying and treating AUD as part of a comprehensive suicide prevention strategy.

### Individual-level risk factors for suicide mortality in the general population: an umbrella review [^114QRKK2]. The Lancet: Public Health (2023). High credibility.

Across risk factors for which sex-stratified estimates were available, associations were largely similar for males and females, but approximately two-thirds of meta-analyses did not provide such information. Further examination of differences and similarities in associations with suicide mortality between males and females could advance our understanding of sex-specific risk factors. In a secondary analysis, we further found that several risk factors (eg, sleep disturbances and parental suicide) had notable differences in their strength of association with suicide mortality compared with attempted suicide, suggesting that these are distinct outcomes.

Four points should be considered when interpreting the risk factor estimates presented in this review. First, effect sizes across individual meta-analyses might not be strictly comparable due to varying levels of adjustment and different study designs. For example, some meta-analyses were restricted to record linkage studiesor psychological autopsy investigations, which makes head-to-head comparisons of effect sizes difficult. Second, the identified risk factors — each one examined in a separate meta-analysis — might not be independent of each other, and thus the effects will not be cumulative. How the risk factors interact needs to be considered. Delineating independent associations at the meta-analytic level would require pooling individual participant data using multivariable models, but we did not identify any such initiatives in this area. Third, due to unmeasured confounding, the observational nature of primary studies included in the meta-analyses does not allow us to establish a causal link between risk factors and suicide mortality. Evidence of causal inference will need to be tested in high-quality studies such as from sibling control designs, Mendelian randomisation, natural experiments, and, when feasible, trials. Fourth, the reported effect sizes do not quantify the effect of risk factors at the population level. Policy planning needs to consider population attributable fractions, which take into account both the prevalence of a risk factor and the magnitude of its effect, assuming causality. One example is a meta-analysis estimating that a fifth of suicide deaths would be prevented if exposure to mood disorders were to be eliminated in the population.

### Sex-specific and age-specific suicide mortality by method in 58 countries between 2000 and 2015 [^114S9tay]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Study limitations

Our analyses were limited by three factors. First, we were limited by data availability. Many countries were excluded because they did not report data to the WHO mortality database, including China, India and Russia. We also excluded countries with small annual suicide deaths in order to obtain robust subgroup suicide mortality rates by sex, age group and suicide method. Complete analyses could be made if the GBD study group extended their database to offer detailed groups of fatalities by suicide method rather than estimating only two groups (self-harm by firearm and self-harm by other specified means). Second, due to lack of data concerning relevant risk factors such as previous suicide attempts, mental health disorders, substance use disorders and inappropriate media reporting, we cannot explain the causality of suicide rate changes and mortality differences by sex, age, suicide method and country. Last, given the social taboo of suicide in almost all cultures, data on suicide rates suffer from challenges in data quality, including underreporting and misclassification. Such effects likely impact our results, especially for those countries with poor-quality suicide mortality data and those with particularly strong sociocultural biases concerning suicidality.

### Individual-level risk factors for suicide mortality in the general population: an umbrella review [^116Y5tdH]. The Lancet: Public Health (2023). High credibility.

Summary

Background

Deaths by suicide remain a major public health challenge worldwide. Identifying and targeting risk factors for suicide mortality is a potential approach to prevention. We aimed to summarise current knowledge on the range and magnitude of individual-level risk factors for suicide mortality in the general population and evaluate the quality of the evidence.

Methods

In this umbrella review, five bibliographic databases were systematically searched for articles published from database inception to Aug 31, 2022. We included meta-analyses of observational studies on individual-level risk factors for suicide mortality in the general population. Biological, genetic, perinatal, and ecological risk factors were beyond the scope of this study. Effect sizes were synthesised and compared across domains. To test robustness and consistency of the findings, evidence for small-study effects and excess significance bias (ie, the ratio between the overall meta-analysis effect size and that of its largest included study) was examined, and prediction intervals were calculated. Risk of bias was assessed by the Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews instrument. The protocol was pre-registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021230119).

Findings

We identified 33 meta-analyses on 38 risk factors for suicide mortality in the general population. 422 (93%) of the 454 primary studies included in the meta-analyses were from high-income countries. A previous suicide attempt and suicidal ideation emerged as strong risk factors (with effect sizes ranging from 6 to 16). Psychiatric disorders were associated with a greatly elevated risk of suicide mortality, with risk ratios in the range of 4–13. Suicide risk for physical illnesses (such as cancer and epilepsy) and sociodemographic factors (including unemployment and low education) were typically increased two-fold. Contact with the criminal justice system, state care in childhood, access to firearms, and parental death by suicide also increased the risk of suicide mortality. Among risk factors for which sex-stratified analyses were available, associations were generally similar for males and females. However, the quality of the evidence was limited by excess significance and high heterogeneity, and prediction intervals suggested poor replicability for almost two-thirds of identified risk factors.

Interpretation

A wide range of risk factors were identified across various domains, which underscores suicide mortality as a multifactorial phenomenon. Prevention strategies that span individual and population approaches should account for the identified factors and their relative strengths. Despite the large number of risk factors investigated, few associations were supported by robust evidence. Evidence of causal inference will need to be tested in high-quality study designs.

### Sex-specific association of alcohol use disorder with suicide mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1179oUbB]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

To our knowledge, this study represents the most up-to-date, comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis on the sex-specific association between AUD and suicide mortality and is the first to also investigate key methodological moderators (ie, comparator group and study design) of the respective association. Alcohol use disorder is associated with higher odds of death by suicide, an association that is similar across the sexes. It is evident that identifying and treating AUD is an important component of a comprehensive suicide prevention strategy.

### Machine learning and the prediction of suicide in psychiatric populations: a systematic review [^111Cw3cy]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The prediction of suicide has been a challenge for decades, and to date, a method for anticipating individual suicides or stratifying patients according to suicide risk is still lacking. Suicide is a worldwide phenomenon and ranks as the second most frequent cause of premature mortality in individuals between 15 and 29 years (preceded only by traffic accidents), and as the third in the age group 15–44 years.

Alarmingly, recent studies suggest that the detection of risk factors and the implementation of interventions are inadequate. The majority of individuals who have attempted suicide are reported to consult with physicians prior to the attempt, suggesting that a possibility to intervene might be possible in these help-seeking subjects. The difficulty in predicting suicidal behaviors relies on the lack of clear psychiatric biomarkers and the poor predictive power of individual risk factors. Suicidal behaviors, as many other psychiatric phenomena, are likely the result of the complex relationship between several environmental and trait variables interacting to modify the actual risk rate. Well-recognized risk factors for suicide encompass mental disorders, previous suicide attempts, early trauma, negative life events, and vulnerable periods, with important differences among sexes in terms of ideation and lethality. However, traditional suicide risk factors have only limited clinical predictive value and show a relatively poor clinical utility in predicting suicide occurrence, even in high-risk population, such as depressed patients.

### Trends and seasonality of emergency department visits and hospitalizations for suicidality among children and adolescents in the US from 2016 to 2021 [^113YXZSi]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

The present results support previous work suggesting that during adolescence, females may be at greater risk for suicidality than males, while males are more likely to die by suicide. Our results indicated an approximately 2 times higher rate in suicidality among females compared with males and a resurgence in suicidality risk above the estimated pre–COVID-19 trend line for females once schools were reopened in late 2020. We also confirmed higher rates of suicidality in Mountain states. Prior studies found a strong positive correlation between the mean altitude of the county and the suicide rate. Possible reasons speculated were hypoxia affecting brain activity, greater access to firearms, and increased isolation and poverty rates. The most common method of self-harm or suicide attempt was drug poisoning among adolescents, which is consistent with increased trends in adolescent drug overdose.

Limitations

This study had several limitations. First, the present data set contained only privately insured members and may not be generalizable to all US children and adolescents. Second, the data set contained only suicidal ideation and suicide attempt and did not include data on completed suicides unless death occurred while under treatment, as data were obtained from insurance claims data from acute medical settings. In addition, the data relied on treated events as documented by claims data, leaving untreated events invisible to the analysis. Third, ICD-10-CM codes ranging from X71 to X83 for intentional self-inflicted injury are codes for external causes of morbidity and tend to be underreported. Unless a clinician is subject to a state-specific, external cause code reporting mandate or is required by a particular payer, reporting is voluntary. However, more than 90% of injury hospitalizations and ED visits are reported with an external cause code; thus, the magnitude of underestimation is unknown but likely modest. Fourth, while we observed a temporary disruption in suicidality during the COVID-19 lockdowns, we cannot definitively conclude that this disruption was associated solely with school closures. There may have been other concurrent factors, such as changes in social interactions, increased stress levels, or other pandemic-related circumstances, that were associated with the observed changes in suicidality.

### Lifetime suicide attempts in otherwise psychiatrically healthy individuals [^112NRFyz]. JAMA Psychiatry (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Not all people who die by suicide have a psychiatric diagnosis; yet, little is known about the percentage and demographics of individuals with lifetime suicide attempts who are apparently psychiatrically healthy. If such suicide attempts are common, there are implications for suicide risk screening, research, policy, and nosology.

Objective

To estimate the percentage of people with lifetime suicide attempts whose first attempt occurred prior to onset of any psychiatric disorder.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study used data from the US National Epidemiologic Study of Addictions and Related Conditions III (NESARC-III), a cross-sectional face-to-face survey conducted with a nationally representative sample of the US civilian noninstitutionalized population, and included persons with lifetime suicide attempts who were aged 20 to 65 years at survey administration (April 2012 to June 2013). Data from the NESARC, Wave 2 survey from August 2004 to September 2005 were used for replication. Analyses were performed from April to August 2023.

Exposure

Lifetime suicide attempts.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcome was presence or absence of a psychiatric disorder before the first lifetime suicide attempt. Among persons with lifetime suicide attempts, the percentage and 95% CI of those whose first suicide attempt occurred before the onset of any apparent psychiatric disorders was calculated, weighted by NESARC sampling and nonresponse weights. Separate analyses were performed for males, females, and 3 age groups (20 to < 35, 35–50, and > 50 to 65 years).

Results

In the total sample of 36 309 respondents, 1948 persons had lifetime suicide attempts; 66.8% (95% CI, 64.1%-69.4%) were female, and 6.2% (95% CI, 4.9%-7.4%) had no apparent lifetime psychiatric diagnoses when surveyed. In addition, 13.4% (95% CI, 11.6%-15.2%) made their first suicide attempt prior to psychiatric disorder onset. Thus, an estimated 19.6% of respondents first attempted suicide without an antecedent psychiatric disorder. No significant age or sex differences were detected in the percentage of those with lifetime suicide attempts absent psychiatric disorders, although females were more likely than males to attempt suicide in the year of psychiatric disorder onset (14.9% [95% CI, 12.5%-17.3%] vs 8.6% [95% CI, 6.0%-11.2%]; P < .001), and attempts were less frequent among those older than 50 to 65 years (3.9% [95% CI, 3.5%-4.4%] vs 6.1% [95% CI, 5.4%-6.8%] for 35–50 years and 6.2% [95% CI, 5.6%-6.9%] for 20 to < 35 years; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, an estimated 19.6% of individuals who attempted suicide did so despite not meeting criteria for an antecedent psychiatric disorder. This finding challenges clinical notions of who is at risk for suicidal behavior and raises questions about the safety of limiting suicide risk screening to psychiatric populations.

### The lethality of suicide methods: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114zDUCw]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The use of suicide methods largely determines the outcome of suicide acts. However, no existing meta-analysis has assessed the case fatality rates (CFRs) by different suicide methods. The current study aimed to fill this gap.

Methods

We searched Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, ProQuest and Embase for studies reporting method-specific CFRs in suicide, published from inception to 31 December 2020. A random-effect model meta-analysis was applied to compute pooled estimates.

Results

Of 10,708 studies screened, 34 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Based on the suicide acts that resulted in death or hospitalization, firearms were found to be the most lethal method (CFR:89.7%), followed by hanging/suffocation (84.5%), drowning (80.4%), gas poisoning (56.6%), jumping (46.7%), drug/liquid poisoning (8.0%) and cutting (4.0%). The rank of the lethality for different methods remained relatively stable across study setting, sex and age group. Method-specific CFRs for males and females were similar for most suicide methods, while method-CFRs were specifically higher in older adults.

Conclusions

This study is the first meta-analysis that provides significant evidence for the wide variation of the lethality of suicide methods. Restricting highly lethal methods based on local context is vital in suicide prevention.

### Patterns of sex-specific and age-specific risk indicators of suicide: a population-nested case-control study [^111veKuY]. BMJ Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

Prevalence of risk indicators preceding suicide

Of those who died by suicide, 57% were dispensed sedatives and 49% antidepressants in the preceding year, compared with 12% and 10% of controls, respectively; 42% had psychiatric outpatient visits, compared with 3% of controls; 25% had received psychiatric inpatient care versus 0.6% among controls and 10% had records of self-harm in the year preceding suicide compared with 0.1% among controls (online supplemental eTable 2).

Nearly all risk indicators were more prevalent among females that died by suicide compared with males (table 2, figure 1). For those that died by suicide, the median point prevalence (IQR) across the 25 risk indicators was 13% (1%, 29%) in females and 7% (2%, 20%) in males. In the year preceding suicide, females had a higher occurrence of self-harm, psychiatric inpatient and outpatient care, all mental disorders except substance use and all sociodemographic factors except unemployment. Most risk indicators also occurred more frequently in the age group 25–44 years and decreased with age (table 2, figure 1). The median point prevalence (IQR) was 12% (1%, 26%) in 15–24 year-olds, 16% (3%, 30%) in 25–44 year-olds, 11% (3%, 24%) in 45–64 year-olds and 5% (1%,16%) in those 65 years or above that died by suicide. Some notable exceptions to this age trend were antidepressants, sedatives and relative poverty, for which the prevalence remained largely stable or increased with age.

### Screening for depression and suicide risk in children and adolescents: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114jy3Zx]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Suicide risk in adolescents — males had a higher rate of suicide completion (17.9 deaths per 100 000 persons) than females (5.4 deaths per 100 000 persons); however, the risk of suicide attempts was greater in females than in males, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer adolescents demonstrate higher rates of suicidal ideation and attempts compared with heterosexual adolescents. Treatments to reduce risk for suicide attempt include psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy (eg, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and mood stabilizers), but it is unclear how effective these therapies are in reducing suicide attempts in children and adolescents who do not have recognized signs or symptoms of being suicidal.

### Estimating the rates of deaths by suicide among adults who attempt suicide in the United States [^111CQSin]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2016). Low credibility.

Background

In 2012, over 1.3 million U.S. adults reported that they attempted suicide in the past year, and 39,426 adults died by suicide. This study estimated national suicide case fatality rates among adult suicide attempters (fatal and nonfatal cases) and examined how they varied by sociodemographic characteristics.

Methods

We pooled data on deaths by suicide (n = 147,427, fatal cases in the U.S.) from the 2008–2011 U S. mortality files and data on suicide attempters who survived (n = 2000 nonfatal cases) from the 2008–2012 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health. Descriptive analyses and multivariable logistic regression models were applied.

Results

Among adult suicide attempters in the U.S., the overall 12-month suicide case fatality rate was 3.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.9%-3.5%). It varied significantly by sociodemographic factors. For those aged 45 or older, the adjusted suicide case fatality rate was higher among men (7.6%) than among women (2.6%) (suicide case fatality rate ratio (SCFRR) = 3.0, 95% CI = 1.83–4.79), was higher among non-Hispanic whites (7.9%) than among non-white minorities (0.8–2.5%) (SCFRRs = 3.2–9.9), and was higher among those with less than high school education (16.0%) than among college graduates (1.8%) (SCFRR = 8.8, 95% CI = 3.83–20.16). Across male and female attempters, being aged 45 or older and non-Hispanic white and having less than secondary school were at a higher risk for death by suicide.

Conclusions

Focusing on these demographic characteristics can help identify suicide attempters at higher risk for death by suicide, inform clinical assessments, and improve suicide prevention and intervention efforts by increasing high-risk suicide attempters' access to mental health treatment.

### Suicide and self-harm [^113Z8a4Y]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Suicide and self-harm are major health and societal issues worldwide, but the greatest burden of both behaviours occurs in low-income and middle-income countries. Although rates of suicide are higher in male than in female individuals, self-harm is more common in female individuals. Rather than having a single cause, suicide and self-harm are the result of a complex interplay of several factors that occur throughout the life course, and vary by gender, age, ethnicity, and geography. Several clinical and public health interventions show promise, although our understanding of their effectiveness has largely originated from high-income countries. Attempting to predict suicide is unlikely to be helpful. Intervention and prevention must include both a clinical and community focus, and every health professional has a crucial part to play.

### Ethnicity and suicide in england and wales: a national linked cohort study [^116GCuS7]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

In England and Wales, we found that almost all minority ethnic groups have a lower rate of suicide than the White British majority, with the exception of individuals who identify as being from a Mixed heritage background or White Gypsy or Irish Travellers. In males, the rate of suicide in these two groups and White Irish individuals was similar to the White British majority, but in females, rates were 79% higher in individuals from a Mixed White and Caribbean heritage background, and more than double in White Gypsy or Irish Travellers. The higher rate of suicide seen in some minority ethnic groups appears to be driven by a greater suicide risk in descendant populations (ie, potentially minority ethnic British-born individuals), rather than migrants. More males than females died by suicide across all ethnic groups, with considerably higher rates in males who identified as Black other compared with females (9:1). Older individuals (aged ≥ 65 years) from a Chinese ethnic background had a higher rate of suicide than their younger counterparts. There were no apparent differences in methods used for suicide across minority ethnic groups.

### Suicide and suicidal behaviour [^111svx7p]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Suicide is a complex public health problem of global importance. Suicidal behaviour differs between sexes, age groups, geographic regions, and sociopolitical settings, and variably associates with different risk factors, suggesting aetiological heterogeneity. Although there is no effective algorithm to predict suicide in clinical practice, improved recognition and understanding of clinical, psychological, sociological, and biological factors might help the detection of high-risk individuals and assist in treatment selection. Psychotherapeutic, pharmacological, or neuromodulatory treatments of mental disorders can often prevent suicidal behaviour; additionally, regular follow-up of people who attempt suicide by mental health services is key to prevent future suicidal behaviour.

### Alcohol consumption per capita and suicide: a meta-analysis [^113JRE22]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is alcohol consumption per capita associated with suicide mortality and, if so, does the association differ by sex?

Findings

This meta-analysis included 13 studies and found that a 1-L increase in alcohol consumption per capita was associated with a 3.59% increase in the suicide mortality rate. There was no evidence of a sex difference in this association.

Meaning

These findings suggest that alcohol consumption per capita may be a useful target to consider within comprehensive national suicide prevention strategies.

### Individual-level risk factors for suicide mortality in the general population: an umbrella review [^113Eg41r]. The Lancet: Public Health (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Death by suicide remains a global public health concern. The causes of suicide mortality are complex, involving a wide range of factors across biological, clinical, psychosocial, and environmental domains. One key approach to inform suicide prevention efforts includes the identification of risk factors, which can help determine the nature and type of interventions required. The number of primary studies examining risk factors for suicide mortality has increased markedly in recent decades, many of which have been quantitatively summarised in meta-analyses. Previous attempts to review this meta-analytic literature have focused on specific factors, including psychiatric disordersand cancer. However, there is a need to assess the full range of risk factors examined in meta-analyses to allow for a comparison of their relative importance. We have therefore conducted an umbrella review of meta-analyses to synthesise the state of knowledge on individual-level risk factors for suicide mortality and evaluate the quality of the underlying review evidence. Findings could inform how public health and clinical services prioritise interventions based on comparative risks, help policy makers to target resources most effectively, and draw attention to gaps in the research literature.

### Global, regional, and national burden of suicide, 1990–2021: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2021 [^117TYiKi]. The Lancet: Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Background

Deaths from suicide are a tragic yet preventable cause of mortality. Quantifying the burden of suicide to understand its geographical distribution, temporal trends, and variation by age and sex is an essential step in suicide prevention. We aimed to present a comprehensive set of global, regional, and national estimates of suicide burden.

Methods

We produced estimates of the number of deaths and age-standardised mortality rates of suicide globally, regionally, and for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021, and disaggregated these results by age and sex. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021 estimates of deaths attributable to suicide were broken down into two comprehensive categories: those by firearms and those by other specified means. For this analysis, we also produced estimates of mean age at the time of death from suicide, incidence of suicide attempts compared with deaths, and age-standardised rates of suicide by firearm. We acquired data from vital registration, verbal autopsy, and mortality surveillance that included 23782 study-location-years of data from GBD 2021. Point estimates were calculated from the average of 1000 randomly selected possible values of deaths from suicide by age, sex, and geographical location. 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) were derived from the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles from a 1000-draw distribution.

Findings

Globally, 746000 deaths (95% UI 692000–800000) from suicide occurred in 2021, including 519000 deaths (485000–556000) among males and 227000 (200000–255000) among females. The age-standardised mortality rate has declined over time, from 14·9 deaths (12·8–15·7) per 100000 population in 1990 to 9·0 (8·3–9·6) per 100000 in 2021. Regionally, mortality rates due to suicide were highest in eastern Europe (19·2 [17·5–20·8] per 100000), southern sub-Saharan Africa (16·1 [14·0–18·3] per 100000), and central sub-Saharan Africa (14·4 [11·0–19·1] per 100000). The mean age at which individuals died from suicide progressively increased during the study period. For males, the mean age at death by suicide in 1990 was 43·0 years (38·0–45·8), increasing to 47·0 years (43·5–50·6) in 2021. For females, it was 41·9 years (30·9–46·7) in 1990 and 46·9 years (41·2–52·8) in 2021. The incidence of suicide attempts requiring medical care was consistently higher at the regional level for females than for males. The number of deaths by suicide using firearms was higher for males than for females, and substantially varied by country and region. The countries with the highest age-standardised rate of suicides attributable to firearms in 2021 were the USA, Uruguay, and Venezuela.

Interpretation

Deaths from suicide remain variable by age and sex and across geographical locations, although population mortality rates have continued to improve globally since the 1990s. This study presents, for the first time in GBD, a quantification of the mean age at the time of suicide death, alongside comprehensive estimates of the burden of suicide throughout the world. These analyses will help guide future approaches to reduce suicide mortality that consider a public health framework for prevention.

Summary

Background

Deaths from suicide are a tragic yet preventable cause of mortality. Quantifying the burden of suicide to understand its geographical distribution, temporal trends, and variation by age and sex is an essential step in suicide prevention. We aimed to present a comprehensive set of global, regional, and national estimates of suicide burden.

Methods

We produced estimates of the number of deaths and age-standardised mortality rates of suicide globally, regionally, and for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021, and disaggregated these results by age and sex. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021 estimates of deaths attributable to suicide were broken down into two comprehensive categories: those by firearms and those by other specified means. For this analysis, we also produced estimates of mean age at the time of death from suicide, incidence of suicide attempts compared with deaths, and age-standardised rates of suicide by firearm. We acquired data from vital registration, verbal autopsy, and mortality surveillance that included 23 782 study-location-years of data from GBD 2021. Point estimates were calculated from the average of 1000 randomly selected possible values of deaths from suicide by age, sex, and geographical location. 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) were derived from the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles from a 1000-draw distribution.

Findings

Globally, 746 000 deaths (95% UI 692 000–800 000) from suicide occurred in 2021, including 519 000 deaths (485 000–556 000) among males and 227 000 (200 000–255 000) among females. The age-standardised mortality rate has declined over time, from 14·9 deaths (12·8–15·7) per 100 000 population in 1990 to 9·0 (8·3–9·6) per 100 000 in 2021. Regionally, mortality rates due to suicide were highest in eastern Europe (19·2 [17·5–20·8] per 100 000), southern sub-Saharan Africa (16·1 [14·0–18·3] per 100 000), and central sub-Saharan Africa (14·4 [11·0–19·1] per 100 000). The mean age at which individuals died from suicide progressively increased during the study period. For males, the mean age at death by suicide in 1990 was 43·0 years (38·0–45·8), increasing to 47·0 years (43·5–50·6) in 2021. For females, it was 41·9 years (30·9–46·7) in 1990 and 46·9 years (41·2–52·8) in 2021. The incidence of suicide attempts requiring medical care was consistently higher at the regional level for females than for males. The number of deaths by suicide using firearms was higher for males than for females, and substantially varied by country and region. The countries with the highest age-standardised rate of suicides attributable to firearms in 2021 were the USA, Uruguay, and Venezuela.

Interpretation

Deaths from suicide remain variable by age and sex and across geographical locations, although population mortality rates have continued to improve globally since the 1990s. This study presents, for the first time in GBD, a quantification of the mean age at the time of suicide death, alongside comprehensive estimates of the burden of suicide throughout the world. These analyses will help guide future approaches to reduce suicide mortality that consider a public health framework for prevention.

### Age and birth cohort-adjusted rates of suicide mortality among US male and female youths aged 10 to 19 years from 1999 to 2017 [^112C5Kq9]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

In addition to the adjusted rates, this study generated 2 by-products: age effect and cohort effect. First, consistent with published data, there was a curve-linear association between age and the risk of suicide, with the risk increasing with age from 10 to 19 years old. This finding suggests the importance of early prevention to reduce the suicide risk among youths in the United States. Furthermore, the risk started at a lower level and increased more rapidly for female youths than for male youths up to age 16 years. This sex difference could be associated with the earlier emotional and cognitive maturation of female youths compared with male youths. Further studies are needed to investigate the difference in risk associated with age. Suicide prevention guidelines and strategies should also consider this sex difference.

This study revealed a V-shaped cohort effect with a decline in suicide mortality risk for those born from 1980 to 1995 and an increase in suicide mortality risk for those born after 1995. The increased cohort effect of suicide mortality risk after 1995 corresponded with the later Millennial Generation and Generation Z, characterized by long-term internet use and intense social media exposure, both of which have previously been associated with increased risk of suicide.

Limitations

This study has limitations. First, APC modeling uses aggregated data to separate the period effect from the other 2 time-related variables of chronological age and birth year. Therefore, it cannot examine factors associated with the time trend using individual-level data. Second, this study used International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision codes to classify suicide death; misclassification cannot be completely ruled out. Despite the limitations, findings of this study provide new data to measure time trends and sex differences in suicide mortality among US youths. These data are needed for evidence-based planning and precision intervention to reduce the suicide rate.

Epidemiology of Suicide

The lifetime prevalence of suicide is currently unknown, and only 80 countries have good quality data on suicide rates (World Health Organization). The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that ~ 800 000 individuals take their own life each year (World Health Organization). However, this estimate is conservative – suicide rates are often underreported due to stigma and the resulting misclassification of deaths (Klonsky et al.). Broadly, suicide rates have been decreasing in many countries, with a notable increase in the United States (Hedegaard, Curtin, & Warner, increase in suicide mortality in the united states, 1999–2018. nchs data brief, 362. hyattsville, md: national center for health statistics.). In 2017, 1.4% of deaths globally were from suicide (Global Burden of Disease Collaborative Network.) and in most countries, the suicide rate is higher than the homicide rate (Roth et al.).

As discussed above, there are notable epidemiological differences between SA and suicide. Additionally, most people who do die by suicide actually do so on their first known attempt (DeJong, Overholser, & Stockmeier; Suominen et al.). Thus, most suicides do not have any documented SA. Suicide rates also vary by age, sex, and location (Bachmann). In 2016, the global age-standardized suicide rate was 10.5 suicides per 100 000 persons, and the global suicide rate was higher for males than for females. This pattern is reversed in SA, where more women attempt suicide than do men.

With these differences in suicide – the limited number of suicides with previous SA and the reversed male to female ratio between SA and suicide – it would seem that observable risk factors for suicide would account for more variation in predictive models than is currently observed. No single risk factor or set of known risk factors appears to adequately explain suicide. Currently, risk factors with the strongest evidence of epidemiological association with suicide include drug and alcohol misuse, the presence of a neuropsychiatric disorder, and a family history of STBs. Other significant risk factors include access to lethal means, adverse life events, diagnoses of chronic and/or terminal illness, previous SAs, and adverse childhood experiences (Fazel & Runeson).

### Sex-specific association of alcohol use disorder with suicide mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1121sy4f]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Although previous meta-analyses have found that AUD is a risk factor for suicide, the majority have pooled risk estimates across both sexes. Ignoring sex-related differences in the association between AUD and suicide may introduce bias in risk estimates and limit the applicability of the evidence for clinical or public health practice. The few studies that have stratified their meta-analyses by sex are either outdated, or failed to include relevant studies fitting their exposure definition.

Accordingly, the purpose of the present study was to estimate the sex-specific association between AUD and suicide mortality. The following hypotheses were tested: (1) individuals with AUD would have higher odds of dying by suicide vs those without and (2) the association between AUD and suicide mortality would be higher for females than for males. The present study is part of a larger systematic review investigating various measures of alcohol consumption and their association with the risk of death by suicide.

### Cohort effects of suicide mortality are sex specific in the rapidly developed Hong Kong Chinese population, 1976–2010 [^113jnd5v]. Depression and Anxiety (2016). Low credibility.

Background

To examine temporal variations of age, period, and cohort on suicide mortality rate in Hong Kong (HK) from 1976 to 2010, and speculate the macroenvironmental mechanisms of the observed trends.

Methods

Poisson age-period-cohort modeling was used to delineate the effects of age, period, and cohort on suicide mortality. Analysis by sex was also conducted to examine if gender difference exists for suicidal behaviours.

Results

Age-cohort model provides the best fit to the mortality data, implying that the cohort effect is likely to explain more of the contributions to HK's suicide mortality pattern than the period effect. Risk of suicide mortality increases nonlinearly with age and accelerates after age 65–69 for both sexes. Moreover, the cohort effects differ between the sexes-risk of mortality increases continually for men born after 1961, but no change is observed for women since the 1941 cohort.

Conclusions

With increased risk of suicide mortality in younger cohorts and the age effect of suicide mortality, we may see future increase in suicide mortality as these younger cohorts age. Further studies are needed to clarify plausible associations between broader sociohistorical changes in the population impacting psychological risk factors and suicidal behaviour to better inform suicide prevention strategies.

Figure 2
Variation of method-specific suicide mortality rates among persons aged 45–64 years in 2000 and 2015 (/100 000 people) notes: mortality rates were age adjusted using the new who world standard population (who millennium).

Table 2
Age-standardised mortality (/100 000 persons) and percent change in mortality between 2000 and 2015 among persons aged 45–64 years

For females, suicide mortality decreased in 18 countries (largest in Kyrgyzstan:−61%, 95% CI −79% to −28%) but increased in 6 countries (greatest in Australia: 69%, 95% CI 36% to 110%) between 2000 and 2015 (table 2). Female suicide mortality ranged dramatically across the 58 countries both in 2000 (0.8 per 100 000 people for South Africa to 28.5 per 100 000 people for Lithuania) and in 2015 (0.5 per 100 000 people for South Africa to 18.0 per 100 000 people for Belgium) (table 2). Between 2000 and 2015, the most prevalent suicide method changed from other poisoning to hanging in France, Colombia and UK; from firearms and explosives to hanging in Uruguay; from jumping from a height to hanging in Israel and Italy; from pesticide poisoning to hanging in Republic of Korea and Panama; from hanging to other poisoning in Hungary, Austria and Germany; and from pesticide poisoning to other poisoning in Trinidad and Tobago (figure 2, online supplementary tables S3 and S4). In 2015, the most prevalent suicide method was hanging in 40 countries, other poisoning in 14 countries, pesticide poisoning in 2 countries and jumping from a height in 1 country (figure 2, online supplementary table S4).

### Age and birth cohort-adjusted rates of suicide mortality among US male and female youths aged 10 to 19 years from 1999 to 2017 [^116QQps4]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Figure 1.
Schematic Illustration of the Age, Period, and Birth Cohort Effects With Hypothetical Data

In this example, the suicide mortality rate of 6.64 per 100 000 for individuals aged 15 years consists of 3 components: 1 contributing to the mortality rate in 2009, 1 attributing to age from birth to age 15 years, and 1 attributing to the birth year of 1994 (following the shaded boxes from top left to bottom right).

In Figure 1, assuming 2.45 persons per 100 000 completed suicide in 2009, this rate does not correctly reflect the level of suicide in 2009 (the period effect) unless the impacts of age and year of birth are adjusted for. This is because the rate of 2.45 per 100 000 in 2009 contains 2 more components: (1) differences in the risk of suicide by age from 10 to 15 that are contained in the age-specific mortality varying from 0.43 to 6.64 per 100 000 (ie, age effect); (2) differences in the risk of suicide by years of birth from 1994 to 1999 (ie, cohort effect) that are also contained in the age-specific rates. Therefore, using age-specific suicide mortality rates as data, unbiased measure of suicide mortality rates can be obtained based on the period effect. The purpose of this study is to obtain unbiased measures of suicide mortality rates to describe time trend and sex difference with the period effect derived from the age-specific rate using APC modeling method to adjust for age and cohort effects.

### Risk factors for suicide in individuals with depression: a systematic review [^111YSoas]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Depression is the most common psychiatric disorder in people who die by suicide. Awareness of risk factors for suicide in depression is important for clinicians.

Methods

In a systematic review of the international literature we identified cohort and case-control studies of people with depression in which suicide was an outcome, and conducted meta-analyses of potential risk factors.

Results

Nineteen studies (28 publications) were included. Factors significantly associated with suicide were: male gender (OR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.08–2.86), family history of psychiatric disorder (OR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.00–1.97), previous attempted suicide (OR = 4.84, 95% CI = 3.26–7.20), more severe depression (OR = 2.20, 95% CI = 1.05–4.60), hopelessness (OR = 2.20, 95% CI = 1.49–3.23) and comorbid disorders, including anxiety (OR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.03–2.45) and misuse of alcohol and drugs (OR = 2.17, 95% CI = 1.77–2.66).

Limitations

There were fewer studies than suspected. Interdependence between risk factors could not be examined.

Conclusions

The factors identified should be included in clinical assessment of risk in depressed patients. Further large-scale studies are required to identify other relevant factors.

### Global, regional, and national burden of suicide, 1990–2021: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2021 [^1171bztx]. The Lancet: Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Implications of all the available evidence

Quantifying trends in suicide is essential to provide appropriate and timely action. Despite global improvements in the age-standardised death rate over the past 31 years, certain demographic groups are showing rising rates of suicide, revealing specific locations and age groups that urgently need support and enhanced public health intervention strategies. Our analysis of suicide attempts compared with deaths by sex and location showed that males die from suicide more frequently, even though females are far more likely to attempt it. Such findings have important implications for suicide prevention strategies, particularly for highly lethal means, such as those involving firearms. Suicide is amenable to public health intervention: identifying populations most at risk is an essential component of a comprehensive suicide prevention strategy. Understanding the distribution of suicide mortality is fundamental for directing resources and efforts most effectively.

Preventing suicide requires a detailed understanding of existing patterns and trends, and how these vary between locations and demography, yet existing studies on the global burden of suicide of this nature are limited. We used results from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021, which estimated global health loss across 288 causes of disease and injury in 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021, to analyse patterns in suicide by age and sex. Additionally, GBD results were reanalysed to calculate, for the first time, the mean age at the time of suicide death, study-specific age groupings, and incidence mortality ratios. The aim of this study is to quantify patterns in suicide across time and by location, age, sex, and fraction of deaths compared with suicide attempts. By identifying populations most at risk for suicide, we can better inform decision makers, stimulate discussion, and spark innovation around targeted suicide prevention efforts. Since data on suicide remain sparse in some locations, these estimates could also motivate improved data collection efforts that would enable us to provide more accurate and comprehensive estimates moving forward, a key step in reducing the burden of suicide around the world. This manuscript was produced as part of the GBD Collaborator Network and in accordance with the GBD Protocol.

### APA guidelines for psychological practice with boys and men [^116EKfL2]. APA (2018). Medium credibility.

Guideline 7 — aggression, violence, substance abuse, and suicide in boys and men (rationale): Boys and men commit nearly 90% of violent crimes in the United States, and men are at high risk of being the victims of violent crime; for African American males ages 10 to 24, homicide is the leading cause of death and is the second leading cause for Hispanic youth of the same ages. Gender-diverse men face disproportionate criminal justice harms, with documented rates of arrest for transgender and gender-nonconforming people ranging from 35 to 72% and 35% of transgender people victimized while imprisoned by inmates and guards. Suicide burden is substantial: suicide rates are higher for men who have been abused or witnessed abuse in childhood; men constituted more than 70% of suicide deaths in the United States between 2000 and 2012; suicide rates in men over 70 are higher than in any other demographic group worldwide; and the suicide rates of American Indian and Alaska Native men have increased by 38% in recent years. Although depression rates among men are 50% of that of women, men's suicide rates are 4 times that of women, and many men use alcohol or other drugs as a trauma-related avoidance response, with strong links reported between alcohol and suicide completion.

### Age and birth cohort-adjusted rates of suicide mortality among US male and female youths aged 10 to 19 years from 1999 to 2017 [^116RCy4V]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we calculated the age-cohort–adjusted suicide mortality rates to describe the time trends and sex difference in suicide mortality among US youths aged 10 to 19 years from 1999 to 2017. The adjusted rates were calculated based on the period effect estimated using the classic epidemiologic method of APC modeling to control for the effect of chronological age and birth year. The adjusted rates provided unbiased data for evidence-based planning and decision-making for suicide prevention among US youths.

The age-cohort–adjusted suicide mortality rates indicated that suicide mortality among US youths increased continuously and more rapidly than the unadjusted rates had suggested. The unadjusted rates for male youths showed a declining trend before 2007, but this trend disappeared when measured by adjusted rates. The adjusted suicide mortality rate increased more rapidly than the unadjusted rate among female youths. We found that the differences between the adjusted and the unadjusted rates were primarily due to the effect of chronological age and birth year. Although the increasing trend in suicide among youths has been reported in the literature, findings from the adjusted rates indicate that even more urgent action is needed to control the increasing trend.

Although a systematic examination of factors associated with the increasing trends is beyond the scope of this study, a short-term increase in adjusted suicide risk during 2003 to 2005 could be due to reductions in the prescribed antidepressants in response to the regulation issued by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2004. The progressive increases in the adjusted suicide mortality rates for both sexes during the period was associated with the increases in social media exposureand substance abuse. Additional studies with new data are needed to examine factors associated with the increasing trends in suicide.

The sex difference measured by adjusted rates was smaller than that of the unadjusted rate for US youths during the period. Measured by the unadjusted rates, the male-female differences in the rate of suicide deaths youths was 5.8 per 100 000 in 1999 and 7.2 per 100 000 in 2017; however, the sex differences in the 2 years were reduced to 3.2 per 100 000 in 1999 and 4.5 per 100 000 in 2017 when the adjusted rates were used. This finding suggests that we cannot ignore the risk of suicide among female youths, as their risk of suicide was higher than the unadjusted rates shown in this study and those of others in the literature.

### Suicide and suicide risk [^115waDJ5]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2019). High credibility.

Although recent years have seen large decreases in the overall global rate of suicide fatalities, this trend is not reflected everywhere. Suicide and suicidal behaviour continue to present key challenges for public policy and health services, with increasing suicide deaths in some countries such as the USA. The development of suicide risk is complex, involving contributions from biological (including genetics), psychological (such as certain personality traits), clinical (such as comorbid psychiatric illness), social and environmental factors. The involvement of multiple risk factors in conveying risk of suicide means that determining an individual's risk of suicide is challenging. Improving risk assessment, for example, by using computer testing and genetic screening, is an area of ongoing research. Prevention is key to reduce the number of suicide deaths and prevention efforts include universal, selective and indicated interventions, although these interventions are often delivered in combination. These interventions, combined with psychological (such as cognitive behavioural therapy, caring contacts and safety planning) and pharmacological treatments (for example, clozapine and ketamine) along with coordinated social and public health initiatives, should continue to improve the management of individuals who are suicidal and decrease suicide-associated morbidity.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, an increase in APC was associated with an increase in the suicide mortality rate on the population level, and this association was similar across the sexes. As such, APC may be a useful target to consider within comprehensive national suicide prevention strategies.

### Trends in suicide among youth aged 10 to 19 years in the United States, 1975 to 2016 [^1142jZuf]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

The core finding of this study is that the ratio of male to female suicide rates for children and adolescents has declined over the past 40 years. These results expand on previous reports of a disproportionate increase in the suicide rate among female relative to male youth, and highlight a significant reduction in the historically large gap in suicide rates between sexes. Following a downward trend in suicide rates for both sexes in the early 1990s, increasing rates of youth suicide since 2007 have been associated with an accelerated narrowing of the gap between male and female rates, with the largest percentage increase in younger female individuals. These trends were observed across all regions in the United States.

Consistent with earlier studies, our findings provide evidence of racial/ethnic disparities in youth suicide rates among male and female individuals. The male to female IRR of suicide decreased for all racial/ethnic categories since 2007, with a significant declining trend across the study period in younger non-Hispanic white youth and older non-Hispanic youth of other races. Future research to identify sex-specific risk factors for youth suicide and distinct mechanisms of suicide in male and female individuals within racial/ethnic groups could lead to improved suicide prevention strategies and interventions.

A particularly important finding relates to changes in method of suicide, with hanging or suffocation showing a greater increase as the cause of death among female relative to male youth. Consistent with previous reports of increasing rates of suicide by hanging or suffocation in female youth, the male to female IRR of suicide by hanging or suffocation declined significantly for both age groups. It is troubling that a growing proportion of female youth are choosing this more violent and lethal method, as it is well documented female individuals have higher rates of attempted suicide. Most youth suicide decedents actually die on their first attempt, with the likelihood of death on first attempt being associated with lethality of method. Consequently, a sustained shift toward a highly lethal method such as hanging or suffocation by female youth could have grave public health implications and drive elevations in the rates of female suicide. The increasing trend in differences between male and female suicide rates by firearms across the study period highlights the continuing need for prevention strategies aimed at restricting access to lethal means. The importance of poisoning as a means of suicide in female youth has been well established, and no significant changes were observed in the proportion of female individuals dying by self-poisoning across the study period.

### Ethnicity and suicide in england and wales: a national linked cohort study [^113J3Gss]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2024). High credibility.

When sufficient data were available, we calculated age-group and sex-specific suicide rates (tables 2, 3). In males, the rate of suicide varied considerably by age and ethnic group (table 2). Older males from a Chinese ethnic background had an elevated rate of suicide compared with their younger counterparts (13·15 vs 2·41−4·53 per 100 000 person-years). Working-aged males who identified as White British had a higher rate of suicide than their younger and older equivalents, a pattern also observed in males who identified as White Gypsy or Irish Travellers. The rate of female suicide was broadly similar across age groups by ethnicity, with the exception of older females who identified as Chinese, who had a rate five times higher (16·96 vs 3·13−3·26 per 100 000 person-years) than their younger counterparts (table 3). This elevated rate in older adults was also observed in females identifying as Black African (5·45 vs 1·72−2·01 per 100 000 person-years) and Other (10·93 vs 2·00 per 100 000 person-years). The rate of suicide also appears to be much higher in working age females from a Mixed White and Caribbean background compared with adolescents and emerging adults (11·18 vs 5·27 per 100 000 person-years).

The greatest proportion of suicide deaths were by hanging in males and females across all ethnic groups (appendix p 3). For example, hanging was the method used by 57·8% of males and 47·8% of females who identified as Indian.

Migrants constituted 2211 (7%) of 30 820 suicide deaths in the sample (1576 males; 635 females). The rate of suicide was consistently lower among migrants than non-migrants, regardless of ethnicity (table 4). The lower rate of suicides in migrants was similar in term of magnitude of effect in both sexes. The male to female ratio varied considerably between ethnic groups, but generally more males died by suicide than females (with a ratio of 6·3 for migrants who identified as Asian). Female migrants from the other ethnic groups appeared to be just as likely to die by suicide as their male counterparts.

### Gender and age differences in suicide mortality in the context of violent death: findings from a multi-state population-based surveillance system [^112tG4qa]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Males are more likely than females to die by all forms of violent death, including suicide. The primary purpose of the present study was to explore whether the gender difference in suicide rates is largely accounted for by males' general greater tendency to experience violent deaths. The current study examined gender and age differences in suicides and other violent deaths, using data from a population-based surveillance system.

Method

Pearson's chi-square tests and logistic regression analyses were conducted with data for 32,107 decedents in the 2003–2005 National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS). Decedents were categorized by gender, age, and death by suicide versus other violent means.

Results

When suicides were examined in the greater context of violent death, the total proportion of violent deaths due to suicide did not differ across gender. When deaths were examined by age group, after controlling for ethnicity, marital status, and U.S. location in which the death occurred, males in early to mid childhood were significantly more likely than same-aged females to die by suicide relative to all other violent deaths. The portion of deaths due to suicide was for the most part equal across both genders in late childhood, young adulthood, and mid-adulthood. Older males were more likely than older females to die by suicide relative to other violent deaths.

Conclusion

Our findings suggest that that the risk of dying by suicide relative to other violent deaths may be more pronounced at certain developmental stages for each gender. This knowledge may be valuable in tailoring prevention strategies.

### Individual-level risk factors for suicide mortality in the general population: an umbrella review [^1118z8uG]. The Lancet: Public Health (2023). High credibility.

In addition to providing an overview of risk factors, we evaluated whether there were indications of bias in this meta-analytic literature. We found that the overall quality of the evidence was not strong, with most reported evidence on risk factors showing high heterogeneity and excess significance. For 62% of identified risk factors, prediction intervals included the null value, suggesting poor replicability in future studies. Some of the reported associations with suicide mortality should therefore be interpreted with caution, and effect size ranges should be considered. Furthermore, only 36% of included meta-analyses were rated as low risk of bias. Common limitations included the absence of pre-registered protocols and insufficient consideration of heterogeneity and bias in primary studies. Future reviews should therefore focus on adhering to methodological guidelines. Other recommendations for future meta-analyses include considering confounding more carefully, reporting pooled analyses disaggregated by sex, and estimating population attributable fractions for the risk factors being investigated.

### Patterns of sex-specific and age-specific risk indicators of suicide: a population-nested case-control study [^111tYRiR]. BMJ Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

We conducted a nested case-control study of 19 741 suicide cases and 197 296 general population controls to describe the sex-specific and age-specific prevalence of 25 clinical and sociodemographic risk indicators in the year preceding suicide and their associations with suicide in the general population. Importantly, we aimed to describe risk indicators, not causes, of suicide. This comprehensive account of sex-specific and age-specific short-term suicide risk indicators allowed us to discern some key patterns not easily recognised in prior research.

First, nearly all risk indicators were less prevalent preceding male suicides, compared with female suicides, and most indicators also had weaker associations with suicide among males than females, on the relative risk scale. This sex difference is noteworthy as it suggests that most risk indicators have a lower statistical sensitivity for predicting suicide in males, meaning that a lesser proportion of male suicides could be detected using these register-based indicators. One possible explanation for this, at least for risk indicators related to psychiatric care, is that men facing mental health problems do not seek care to the same extent women do. This could explain the low prevalence and could also attenuate the associations between mental disorders and care utilisation with suicide among males, similar to how misclassification can lead to underestimated effect sizes. Another explanation could be sex differences in the methods of suicide. Males who die by suicide tend to use more lethal methods than females, which could partly explain why register-based risk indicators are less frequent among males who die by suicide. Our results dovetail some prior findings showing that prediction models, using data from mainly electronic health records but also other registers, show lower sensitivities for predicting suicide and suicide attempts among males than females, even when sex is accounted for.

### Genetic contributions to suicidal thoughts and behaviors [^115euyzt]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Epidemiology

Decades of research have indicated that STBs have shared unique risk factors that vary by population and by individual. Two people can manage STBs and yet share very few risk factors. This makes it difficult to characterize risks at a population level without also characterizing specific risk groups. And since STBs do not result in death for most individuals (Turecki & Brent,), examining risk factors for SI, SA and suicide separately and together will help to differentiate risk factors for each phenotype.

Epidemiology of SI and SA

There have been more studies focusing on SI and SA than on suicide. Rates of SI and SA are higher than that of suicide, and obtaining clinical or genetic data on suicide death has been historically challenging. The stigma associated with dying by suicide has negatively influenced reporting rates (Nock, Borges, & Ono). Another challenge to collecting data specific to suicide has been the ethical and legal complexities of obtaining postmortem suicide data. Relatedly, many geographic locations cannot process postmortem examinations in a centralized fashion, compounding the difficulty of collecting and examining genetic data from large enough cohorts. Additionally, the low population base rate of suicide makes it difficult to obtain sufficient sample sizes. To provide some perspective on this base rate, for every suicide there are approximately 20 individuals with SAs, and many more with SIs (World Health Organization).

Lifetime prevalence rates are roughly 9.2% for SI and 2.7% for SA. However, sex ratios of suicide and SA differ dramatically, with a 4:1 ratio of males to females for suicide death and virtually the opposite pattern for SA (Nock et al.), a significant epidemiological difference dividing SA from suicide. Among people who attempt suicide, only 10–15% eventually go on to die from suicide, with 1.6% of suicides occurring within 1 year and 3.9% within 5 years of an attempt (Olfson et al; Suominen et al.). In other words, SA and SI can lead to an eventual suicide death, but for the vast majority of people, it does not. Within the realm of SI and SA, more research is needed that compares individuals with chronic SI who do not attempt suicide to those with SAs.

### Global differences in geography, religion and other societal factors are associated with sex differences in mortality from suicide: an ecological study of 182 countries [^116WhuWb]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Over 800,000 individuals die as a consequence of suicide annually, and almost two thirds of these deaths are in males. This analysis aimed to explore sex differences in global suicide rates with regards to geographic location, religion and other societal factors.

Methods

Data on sex-specific suicide rates were collated for 182 countries in 2015. The exposures of interest were geographical location, majority religion, life expectancy, total fertility rate (TFR), literacy percentage, gender development index and gross domestic product.

Results

Both continent and predominant religion were strongly associated with the male:female ratio for deaths from suicide (p < 0.001 for both variables). The highest male:female suicide ratio was observed in the Americas with a median value of 4.0 (interquartile range IQR: 3.0–5.0) and the lowest gender suicide ratios were observed in Africa (2.7, IQR: 2.4–3.3) and Asia (2.7, IQR: 1.8–3.9). The predominantly Christian countries revealed the highest male:female suicide ratio (3.3, IQR: 2.7–4.4) whereas the predominantly Hindu countries revealed the lowest (1.3, IQR 1.3–3.8). The following variables were all positively associated with male:female ratio of suicide mortality: Life expectancy (Spearman's correlation coefficient r = +0.21, p = 0.004), GDP per capita (r = +0.26, p = 0.003), literacy percentage (r = +0.46, p < 0.0001), and Gender Development Index (r = +0.56, p < 0.0001). TFR was negatively associated with sex suicide ratio (-0.30, p < 0.0001).

Conclusion

There are significant differences between male and female suicide rates across continents and cultures. Markers of societal development are associated with a higher proportion of male suicides compared to females.

### Late-life suicide trends in selected major countries worldwide in 1990–2022: a spatio-temporal analysis from the WHO mortality database [^114787Zm]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Joinpoint analysis of suicide trends (age 75+ years) from 1990 to 2021 or the last available year, according to geographical areas worldwide, in males (solid dot) and females (empty dot) separately.

As shown in Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table S5, significant and steep decreasing trends (around 3–6% annually), especially in the first decades, followed by stabilisations or slower reductions, emerged in most European countries, as well as in Australian males. For example, in Germany late-life suicide mortality declined by 3.6% annually until 2006 in males, and by 6% until 2000 in females; in Italy by 3.1% until 2013 in males, and 5.4% until 2009 in females; in the Netherlands by 3.6% until 2008 in males, and 4% until 2008 in females; in the UK by 2.9% until 2009 in males, and 4.2% until 2007 in females; in Australian males by 3.1% until 2003. Steady reductions over the entire studied period were observed in countries like France (APC: −2.6% in males), Romania (APC: −0.6% in males and −2.6% in females), the Russian Federation (2008–2019: −4.5% in males, and 2007–2019: −7%), Argentina (−4.1% in males and −6.2% in females), Canada in females (−1.1), Mexico (−1.8% in males, and −2.7% in females), Japan (2010–2021: −3.8% in males, and 2002–2021: −4.1% in females). Conversely, there were some exceptions where, after initial declines in the 1990s, suicide mortality began to increase in recent years. In the USA, male rates increased by 1.3% annually from 2008 onwards; in Brazilian females, an annual increase of 10.2% was observed from 2017 to 2021; and in Australian females, by 2.3% annually since 2003.

### Age and birth cohort-adjusted rates of suicide mortality among US male and female youths aged 10 to 19 years from 1999 to 2017 [^117RqiY6]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Methods

Data Source

Deidentified suicide data were extracted from the Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research database, a public domain database prepared by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote research. Total population and suicide deaths by single year of age from 10 to 19 years and by sex from 1999 to 2017 were included. Suicide deaths were those coded as U03, X60-X84, and Y87.0 in the Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research database, following the definition of suicide in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision. This study was guided by Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline for cross-sectional studies and was approved by the institutional review board at the University of Florida. Informed consent was waived because the data were deidentified.

Time-Related Risk Factors

The 3 examined time-related risk factors were age in years, year of birth, and year when a suicide occurred. The registered age of suicide death was used as the variable age, and it ranged from 10 to 19 years. The year when the reported suicide death occurred was used as the variable period, and it ranged from 1999 to 2017. The year of birth was computed by subtracting the age from the period and was used as the variable cohort; it ranged from 1980 to 2007. These 3 time-related variables were used for APC modeling analysis.

### Age and birth cohort-adjusted rates of suicide mortality among US male and female youths aged 10 to 19 years from 1999 to 2017 [^116E9RJ6]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Strategic planning to curb increasing suicide rate among US youths requires unbiased measures of suicide mortality, as the unadjusted suicide mortality rates conventionally used in describing time trends and sex patterns are confounded by the differences in chronological age and year of birth.

Objective

To measure time trends and sex differences in suicide mortality among US youths using age and birth cohort (age-cohort)-adjusted rates.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This population-based multiyear cross-sectional study of US youths aged 10 to 19 years was a secondary analysis of the suicide data for January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2017, derived from the Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research, a database prepared by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote research. Data analysis was conducted from May 24 to May 27, 2019.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Age-cohort-adjusted suicide mortality rates by year and sex were used as the main outcomes. These adjusted rates were calculated based on the period effect estimated with the age-period-cohort (APC) modeling method. Participants' age, year of birth, and the year when suicide occurred were used as time-related risk factors.

Results

Age-cohort-adjusted suicide mortality rates were estimated successfully by year and by sex. The adjusted rates were obtained after controlling for a V-shaped cohort effect and a curved age effect that also differed by sex. The unadjusted suicide mortality rate for male youths increased from 7.4 per 100 000 in 1999 to 10.7 per 100 000 in 2017, while the adjusted rate increased from 4.9 per 100 000 in 1999 to 8.7 per 100 000 in 2017. The unadjusted suicide mortality rates for female youths were 1.6 per 100 000 in 1999 and 3.5 per 100 000 in 2017, while the adjusted rates were 1.7 per 100 000 in 1999 and 4.2 per 100 000 in 2017.

Conclusions and Relevance

Findings of this study indicate a more rapid increase and smaller male-female difference in suicide rates among US youths since 1999 than those shown by the unadjusted suicide mortality rates. The adjusted rates provide unbiased data that are needed for evidence-based decision-making and strategies to curb the increasing suicide rates among US youths.

Firearm-related suicide

Figure 3 shows a global map of firearm-related suicides. The countries with the highest age-standardised mortality rate due to suicide from firearms in 2021 were the USA (6·19 deaths [95% UI 5·96–6·42] per 100 000 population), Uruguay (3·61 [3·34–3·87] per 100 000), and Venezuela (3·04 [2·31–3·88] per 100 000 (appendix pp 79–87;). The territory of Greenland also had a high rate (12·9 [7·70–19·4] per 100 000), although, given its small population size, the total number of firearm-related suicides was low in 2021 (8·25 deaths [4·83–12·3]). Among males who died from suicide globally in 2021, 9·7% (7·9–12·0) of deaths were caused by firearms (table 1). For females, the percentage of suicide deaths from firearms was 2·9% (2·1–3·7). High-income north America had the highest proportion of suicide deaths due to firearms in 2021, by a large margin, for both males (52·3% [51·8–52·8]) and females (28·2% [27·5–28·9]). The second-leading region by proportion of suicides due to firearms was southern Latin America (17·0% [16·3–17·6] for males and 7·2% [6·6–8·0] for females. Among all sexes combined, there was no substantial difference between the mean age of suicide death by firearm (46·5 years [39·5–53·4]) versus suicide by any other means (47·0 years [43·5–50·7]; appendix 1 p 23). However, females who died from firearm suicides were on average younger (43·8 years [34·8–52·1]) than females who died from other forms of suicide (47·0 years [41·3–53·3]).

### Trends in suicide among youth aged 10 to 19 years in the United States, 1975 to 2016 [^117Y8a88]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

The narrowing gap between male and female rates of suicide was most pronounced among youth aged 10 to 14 years, underscoring the importance of early prevention efforts that take both sex and developmental level into consideration. Results from this study potentially challenge the existing paradox of suicidal behavior where female individuals have higher rates of suicidal ideation and attempted suicide than male individuals, while death by suicide is lower in female individuals than male individuals. This may be especially true within some demographic groups.

Differential increases over time in risk factors for suicide among female compared with male youth could contribute to the observed increase in female suicide rates. A history of suicidal behavior is a leading predictor of future suicide in youth, and although rates of hospitalization for suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in youth have increased over time in both sexes, this increase has been greatest among female youth. Similarly, trends from the 2007 to 2017 national Youth Risk Behavior Surveyrevealed a significantly larger percentage increase in female youth who seriously considered attempting suicide (18.7% to 22.1%) compared with male youth (10.3% to 11.9%). The percentage of female youth who made a suicide plan also increased significantly from 13.4% to 17.1%, while no significant change was found in male youth. Research, has also identified a strong link between youth suicide and mental health, most commonly depression. The Youth Risk Behavior Surveyfound that the percentage of female youth who experienced persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness increased significantly between 2007 and 2017 (from 35.8% to 41.1%), with no significant changes seen in male youth. In addition, our results that show an increase in female suicide rates by hanging or suffocation support evidence linking direct access or proximity to more lethal means with increased rates of suicide.

Limitations

This study is not without limitations. First, these data cannot explain underlying reasons for the narrowing of the gap between the sexes in youth suicide. Second, variations in cause of death coding between the International Classification of Diseases eighth, ninth, and tenth revision coding systems used in this study may have affected results, despite high levels of agreement across these revisions. Third, it is unknown whether the accuracy of classification of a death as suicide in youth has changed during the study period. Fourth, early suicide trends for Hispanic and non-Hispanic categories should be interpreted with caution, as these data were not captured before 1990 and excluded from select states through 1996.

### Why are women more likely to attempt suicide than men? Analysis of lifetime suicide attempts among US adults in a nationally representative sample [^1174SN6h]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

While it is well-known that women are more likely to attempt suicide than men, little is known about risk and protective factors underlying this difference.

Methods

Using data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions Wave III (NESARC-III), we compared women and men with and without self-reported lifetime suicide attempts to identify sociodemographic, clinical, and behavioral characteristics that were associated with suicide attempts for each gender. We then examined the interaction of gender and risk factors to identify specific factors that have a significantly different association with the risk of suicide attempts by gender. Multivariate analyses identified factors that were independently associated with a significant interaction of gender and risk of suicide attempt and the extent to which these interactions accounted for the greater risk of suicide attempts among women.

Results

In unadjusted analysis, women had 1.78 greater odds of self-reported lifetime suicide attempts than men (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.61–1.96). While men and women shared similar risk and protective factors for suicide attempts, several factors were associated with significantly different risks for women than men. In multivariate analysis, these factors only partially accounted for the gender difference in lifetime risk of suicide attempt (adjusted odds ratio, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.12–2.08).

Conclusions

Several risk factors for suicide attempts appear to have significantly different magnitude of association among women and men; however, these differences only partially account for gender difference in risk for suicide attempts, suggesting that other factors, not measured in this study, are at play.

### Global, regional, and national burden of suicide, 1990–2021: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2021 [^116omRTW]. The Lancet: Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Differences between male and female suicides have long been studied. Our study shows that female suicide mortality rates have largely declined since 1990, by as much as 50% globally across all ages which included remarkable reductions in east Asia (73%), the Caribbean (56%), and central Europe (56%). Unfortunately, suicide mortality rates among females in central Latin America, high-income north America, and tropical Latin America have increased over the study period. Similar to 1990, countries in south Asia and high-income Asia Pacific still carry some of the highest burden of female suicide mortality. In 2020, in India, the highest suicide death rates were among educated women, with family problems being the most commonly cited contributing factor. The varying patterns of suicide across locations for females emphasise the need for local strategies for suicide prevention. On both a global scale and for each of 21 GBD regions, the incidence of suicide attempts among females was notably higher than that among males, despite the overall age-standardised mortality rate being much higher for males across the period studied. Females overwhelmingly attempted suicide more often than males, but males are far more likely to die from it, a pattern that has been referred to as the gender paradox of suicide. A leading factor is the choice of means of suicide, where males are more likely to use highly lethal methods, such as firearms.

Firearms are considered the most lethal means of suicide, but our study shows that only a few countries had a high proportion of firearm-related suicide deaths, particularly the USA, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Notably, in 2021, 90·0% of suicide deaths by a firearm were located in areas with just 52·1% of the global population. Abundant research has shown that high rates of firearm-related suicide deaths are linked to rates of firearm possession. Particularly within the USA, research consistently finds a correlation between firearm ownership and suicide, and that owning a firearm increases the risk of death from suicide. One study looking at data from the Small Arms Survey and the National Violent Death Reporting System found that firearm suicide rates are about twice as high among USA-born suicide decedents compared with their foreign-born counterparts.

### Characteristics of veteran and civilian suicide decedents: a sex-stratified analysis [^115xHgm8]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Few studies have examined characteristics distinguishing Veteran and civilian suicide decedents. An understanding of unique risk factors for Veteran suicide is critical to develop effective preventive interventions. This is particularly imperative for female Veterans, who have near double the suicide mortality rate of same-aged female civilians. The objectives of this study were to examine whether Veteran and civilian suicide decedents differed on risk factors and suicide-event characteristics, and to determine whether predictors changed based on sex.

Methods

Data from 116,515 suicides collected by the National Violent Death Reporting System in 27 states between 2003 and 2015 were analyzed in 2018 in sex-stratified analyses. Logistic regression models examined population differences in risk factors and suicide-event characteristics.

Results

Relative to male civilians, male Veterans were more likely to have a contributing physical health problem (AOR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.06, 1.14) and to use a firearm for their suicide (AOR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.36, 1.47); they were less likely to have substance use problems (AOR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.66, 0.75), depressed mood (AOR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.90, 0.97), or financial problems (AOR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.86, 0.97). Female Veterans were more likely to use a firearm for their suicide (AOR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.19, 1.63) relative to female civilians.

Conclusions

Firearm use as a suicide method was a key distinguishing feature of Veteran suicide. Means restriction and firearm safety are pertinent to preventing Veteran suicide. Given low utilization of mental health care and frequent presence of physical health problems in this population, safe storage messages may have a greater preventive impact if delivered in primary care or other nonpsychiatric settings.

### Sex-specific association of alcohol use disorder with suicide mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115Qir1a]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

Based on pooled risk estimates derived from studies using a longitudinal design, AUD is associated with greater than a 2-fold higher odds of death by suicide for both male and female individuals, with no statistical difference between the sexes. Sex differences were apparent in the pooled estimates derived from cross-sectional studies, with female individuals with an AUD having significantly higher odds of dying by suicide compared with their male counterparts. However, causality cannot be inferred with such a study design, as temporality cannot be determined. Therefore, while a sex difference in the association between AUD and suicide mortality was hypothesized based on some previous studies, it appears that any such differences are a function of bias introduced by the study design, and do not reflect causal impact.

Regardless of there not being a statistically significant difference between male and female individuals in the association between AUD and suicide mortality, it is clear that individuals with AUD have elevated odds of dying by suicide compared with those without an AUD. Coupled with the finding that over 80% of individuals who die by suicide had contact with the health care system in the year prior to their suicide, there are clear implications for suicide prevention efforts within the health care system. For instance, the temporal relationship that can be discerned from the meta-analyses of longitudinal studies speaks to the importance of a risk management approach among individuals with an AUD. However, suicide risk management is only possible if AUD is identified. Thus, it is imperative to screen for alcohol use among individuals presenting with depression and/or suicidal ideation. Having said that, the inverse is also true, and depression and/or suicidal ideation should also be screened among individuals with AUD. These rather simple screening measures could have an important impact in terms of lives saved.

### Suicide in older adults with and without known mental illness: results from the national violent death reporting system, 2003–2016 [^114hSfeQ]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Suicide risk increases with age, and evidence exists for the underdiagnosis and undertreatment of suicide risk in older adults. Recent data suggest that many U.S. adults who die from suicide do not have a known mental health condition. This study compares the characteristics and precipitating circumstances of geriatric suicide decedents with and without known mental illnesses.

Methods

This study was a retrospective analysis of suicide deaths for adults aged ≥ 65 years from the National Violent Death Reporting System, 2003–2016 (n = 26,884). ORs compared sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, cause of death, and precipitating circumstances based on coroner/medical examiner and law enforcement reports. Data were collected and analyzed in 2019.

Results

Most older male (69.1%) and female (50.2%) suicide decedents did not have a known mental illness. A physical health problem was the most prevalent precipitating circumstance but was more common among older adults without known mental illness. Past suicide attempt, disclosure of suicidal intent, depressed mood, and substance use were more common among those with a known mental illness. More than three fourths of suicide decedents did not disclose their suicidal intent. Most suicide deaths involved firearms, which were disproportionately used by decedents without known mental illness (81.6% of male and 44.6% of female decedents) compared with those with known mental illness (70.5% of male and 30.0% of female decedents).

Conclusions

Most older adults who die from suicide do not have a known mental health condition. The rapidly growing U.S. geriatric population calls for more effective methods to identify and treat at-risk older adults, particularly those who are male.

### Screening for depression and suicide risk in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1158adiN]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Adult suicide risk — demographics and trends underscore variation by age, sex, race, and ethnicity. The page states that suicide risk varies by age, sex, and race and ethnicity and that men are more than 3 times more likely to die by suicide than women. The highest suicide rates for women occur between the ages of 45 and 54 years, while for men the highest rates occur after age 85 years. In the US, the highest suicide rates occur among White adults, followed by Native American/Alaska Native adults, and between 2014 and 2019, suicide rates increased in Asian or Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander individuals by 16% and in Black individuals by 30%.

### Deaths from violence in north carolina, 2004: how deaths differ in females and males [^116HsnGx]. Injury Prevention (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify gender differences in violent deaths in terms of incidence, circumstances, and methods of death.

Design

Analysis of surveillance data.

Setting

North Carolina, a state of 8.6 million residents on the eastern seaboard of the US.

Subjects

1674 North Carolina residents who died from violence in the state during 2004.

Methods

Information on violent deaths was collected by the North Carolina Violent Death Reporting System using data from death certificates, medical examiner reports, and law enforcement agency incidence reports.

Results

Suicide and homicide rates were lower for females than males. For suicides, females were more likely than males to have a diagnosis of depression (55% v 36%), a current mental health problem (66% v 42%), or a history of suicide attempts (25% v 13%). Firearms were the sole method of suicide in 65% of males and 42% of females. Poisonings were more common in female than male suicides (37% v 12%). Male and female homicide victims were most likely to die from a handgun or a sharp instrument. Fifty seven percent of female homicides involved intimate partner violence, compared with 13% of male homicides. Among female homicides involving intimate partner violence, 78% occurred in the woman's home. White females had a higher rate of suicide than African-American females, but African-American females had a higher rate of homicide than white females.

Conclusions

The incidence, circumstances, and methods of fatal violence differ greatly between females and males. These differences should be taken into account in the development of violence prevention efforts.

### A review of suicide in boys [^116VgrsD]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Suicide ranks as the 11th leading cause of death. Males, although representing half of the population, account for nearly 80% of completed suicides across all age groups. Certain aspects of traditional masculinity, particularly self-reliance, increase the risk of suicidal behavior. Psychosocial stressors also significantly contribute to suicide in children and adolescents, independently of psychiatric illnesses. This article will explore the gender differences in suicidal behavior and risk factors among male adolescents, with implications for prevention and improvement in mental health outcomes. The authors will focus on suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and completed suicide.

### Characteristics of deaths by suicide in Northern Ireland from 2005 to 2011 and use of health services prior to death [^11419yHs]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Service presentation may offer an opportunity for intervention prior to suicide. The study aimed to examine the characteristics, disorders and service use profiles of those who had died by suicide in Northern Ireland (NI) from 2005 to 2011.

Methods

An analysis of a database of deaths by suicide and undetermined intent based on data in the NI Coronial files from 2005 to 2011 (N = 1667).

Results

Males are three times as likely to die by suicide as females and suicide rates similar among those aged 20–60 years. Females have increased service use prior to suicide; males tend to disengage with services prior to death. Females are more likely to have recorded prior attempts, service use, diagnosis and referral. The most common health service used was primary care.

Limitations

Despite the inclusion of undetermined deaths (probable suicides) a proportion of deaths by suicide remain unrecorded as such. Data on marital status and mental and physical disorders were based on information recorded by police officers from relatives, other informants and medical records. The reliability of this data may therefore be questioned.

Conclusions

Primary care has an important role in suicide prevention. Gendered patterns in service use prior to death should be considered in suicide prevention programmes. It is important to strengthen clinicians׳ knowledge of the manifestations of suicidal ideation in males and ways of encouraging service use in males. The NI population who were exposed to the height of the violence of the conflict appear to be at increased risk of suicide as they age.

### Late-life suicide trends in selected major countries worldwide in 1990–2022: a spatio-temporal analysis from the WHO mortality database [^113hh3n3]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Suicide is a major and largely preventable public health issue, with rates increasing among people in later life. We aimed to describe global temporal and geographical patterns of suicide mortality among older adults.

Methods

Using the WHO mortality database (latest update: February 2024), we analysed suicide data for individuals aged 75 or older from 1990 to 2022. We selected countries based data availability, completeness, and number of suicide deaths. We computed annual age-standardised suicide mortality rates (ASR) by sex and country, and performed joinpoint regression analyses on a subgroup of major countries and geographical areas.

Findings

We considered suicide data at age 75+ from 48 countries, the EU (27 Member States) and seven geographical areas, and analysed trends in a subgroup of 20 major countries and the areas. Late-life suicide patterns differed across countries, with rates 3–7 times higher among males than females. Several countries showed steady declines by -2% to -6% annually, while in other countries like Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the UK and Australia (males), trends slowed or stopped declining after around 2010. Increases were observed in the USA, Brazil (females), and Australia (females). Among males, the most recent highest ASR was 50.9/100,000 (95% CI: 48.1–53.7) in Centre-East Europe, while the lowest one was 12.8/100,000 (95% CI: 11.9–13.7) in North Europe. The male ASR in the EU-27 was 38.9/100,000 (95% CI: 38.0–39.9). Country-specific ASRs ranged from 10.4/100,000 (95% CI: 9.1–11.7) in the UK to 99.3/100,000 (95% CI: 93.3–104.8) in South Korea. Among females, the highest ASR was 14.4/100,000 (95% CI: 13.8–15.1) in Asia and Oceania while the lowest one was 2.4/100,000 (95% CI: 2.1–2.7) in Centre-South America. The EU-27 female rate was 8.1/100,000 (95% CI: 7.7–8.5). Country-specific ASRs ranged from less than 1 death per 100,000 in Mexico to 29.0/100,000 (95% CI: 26.8–31.3) in South Korea.

Interpretation

Suicide mortality shows substantial variations in rates and trends worldwide. However, data are subject to variable misclassification and underreporting in different countries and geographic areas, and therefore require cautious interpretation.

### Suicide rates in China, 1995–99 [^116Ksf5c]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

Background

A wide range of suicide rates are reported for China because official mortality data are based on an unrepresentative sample and because different reports adjust crude rates in different ways. We aimed to present an accurate picture of the current pattern of suicide in China on the basis of conservative estimates of suicide rates in different population cohorts.

Methods

Suicide rates by sex, 5-year age-group, and region (urban or rural) reported in mortality data for 1995–99 provided by the Chinese Ministry of Health were adjusted according to an estimated rate of unreported deaths and projected to the corresponding population.

Findings

We estimated a mean annual suicide rate of 23 per 100,000 and a total of 287,000 suicide deaths per year. Suicide accounted for 3(.)6% of all deaths in China and was the fifth most important cause of death. Among young adults 15–34 years of age, suicide was the leading cause of death, accounting for 19% of all deaths. The rate in women was 25% higher than in men, mainly because of the large number of suicides in young rural women. Rural rates were three times higher than urban rates-a difference that remained true for both sexes, for all age-groups, and over time.

Interpretation

Suicide is a major public-health problem for China that is only gradually being recognised. The unique pattern of suicides in China is widely acknowledged, so controversy about the overall suicide rate should not delay the development and testing of China-specific suicide-prevention programmes.

### Patterns of sex-specific and age-specific risk indicators of suicide: a population-nested case-control study [^1122L5SM]. BMJ Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

Second, most risk indicators were associated with greater risk differences and a higher absolute suicide risk among males. Simply put, although it was less likely that a male who died by suicide would have a given risk indicator, males that did have the indicator were generally at a higher absolute risk of suicide than females with the same indicator. These opposing sex differences in the relative versus absolute suicide risk may seem contradictory. They are explained, however, by the higher rates of suicide among males. For example, we found a three-fold elevation in suicide risk the year following divorce for both females and males aged 45–64 years. Since the suicide rate is twice as high among males, this three-fold elevation translates to 28 additional suicides among females and 56 additional suicides among males per 100 000 person-years. From a public health perspective, such absolute suicide rates are important to identify groups for whom preventive public health efforts may be especially warranted. Such groups include older males presenting with self-harm, who showed the highest suicide rates of all strata under investigation, although suicide rates were highly elevated following self-harm in all groups. Another group with particularly elevated suicide rates was older males with stress-related disorders.

### Sex-specific association of alcohol use disorder with suicide mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112dBRbF]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Methods

This systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis 2022 statement. The protocol has been published elsewhereand was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews.

Search Strategy

A systematic literature search was performed in Embase, MEDLINE (including MEDLINE In-Process), PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science from database inception to April 27, 2022. The search strategies incorporated a combination of medical subject headings and keywords for alcohol use and suicide (eMethods in Supplement 1). Manual reviews of citations in the articles deemed relevant and the studies included in related reviews and meta-analyses were conducted. In addition to searching for published data, we searched for unpublished data by contacting subject matter experts and investigators and screening conference proceedings. The search results were imported into EndNote 20.3 for removal of deduplicates.

Study Selection

Two individuals (K.V.K. and A.M.L.) were trained to screen titles and abstracts using batches of 100 randomly selected records. Training involved independent review and discussion of all discrepancies, until high agreement (eg, κ > 0.8)was reached. The titles and abstracts of the remaining records were then independently screened by a single reviewer. The same process was used for full-text screening. In cases of uncertainty, a discussion was had between both reviewers; third-party adjudication was used if an agreement could not be reached. Title and abstract screening was completed using EndNote 20.3, and full-text screening was performed in Covidence. Data extraction was completed by one investigator (K.V.K.) using a template created in Excel, version 2019 (Microsoft Corporation)(the template was initially piloted using 10 randomly selected studies) and cross-checked by a second investigator (A.M.L.). If there was inadequate reporting of data, data were unavailable (eg, effect estimate values were not published), or sex-specific estimates were not reported, corresponding authors were contacted.

### Global, regional, and national burden of suicide mortality 1990 to 2016: systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2016 [^111RLyPC]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To use the estimates from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 to describe patterns of suicide mortality globally, regionally, and for 195 countries and territories by age, sex, and Socio-demographic index, and to describe temporal trends between 1990 and 2016.

Design

Systematic analysis.

Main Outcome Measures

Crude and age standardised rates from suicide mortality and years of life lost were compared across regions and countries, and by age, sex, and Socio-demographic index (a composite measure of fertility, income, and education).

Results

The total number of deaths from suicide increased by 6.7% (95% uncertainty interval 0.4% to 15.6%) globally over the 27 year study period to 817000 (762000 to 884000) deaths in 2016. However, the age standardised mortality rate for suicide decreased by 32.7% (27.2% to 36.6%) worldwide between 1990 and 2016, similar to the decline in the global age standardised mortality rate of 30.6%. Suicide was the leading cause of age standardised years of life lost in the Global Burden of Disease region of high income Asia Pacific and was among the top 10 leading causes in eastern Europe, central Europe, western Europe, central Asia, Australasia, southern Latin America, and high income North America. Rates for men were higher than for women across regions, countries, and age groups, except for the 15 to 19 age group. There was variation in the female to male ratio, with higher ratios at lower levels of Socio-demographic index. Women experienced greater decreases in mortality rates (49.0%, 95% uncertainty interval 42.6% to 54.6%) than men (23.8%, 15.6% to 32.7%).

Conclusions

Age standardised mortality rates for suicide have greatly reduced since 1990, but suicide remains an important contributor to mortality worldwide. Suicide mortality was variable across locations, between sexes, and between age groups. Suicide prevention strategies can be targeted towards vulnerable populations if they are informed by variations in mortality rates.

### Suicide among males across the lifespan: an analysis of differences by known mental health status [^115fG7VT]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Suicide among males is a major public health challenge. In 2019, males accounted for nearly 80% of the suicide deaths in the U.S., and suicide was the eighth leading cause of death for males aged ≥ 10 years. Males who die by suicide are less likely to have known mental health conditions than females; therefore, it is important to identify prevention points outside of mental health systems. The purpose of this analysis was to compare suicide characteristics among males with and without known mental health conditions by age group to inform prevention.

Methods

Suicides among 4 age groups of males were examined using the 3 most recent years of data at the time of the analysis (2016–2018) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Violent Death Reporting System. Decedents with and without known mental health conditions were compared within age groups. The analysis was conducted in August 2021.

Results

Most male suicide decedents had no known mental health conditions. More frequently, those without known mental health conditions died by firearm, and many tested positive for alcohol. Adolescents, young adults, and middle-aged males without known mental health conditions more often had relationship problems, arguments, and/or a crisis as a precipitating circumstance than those with known mental health conditions.

Conclusions

Acute stressors more often precipitated suicides of males without known mental health conditions, and they more often involved firearms. These findings underscore the importance of mitigating acute situational stressors that could contribute to emotionally reactive/impulsive suicides. Suicide prevention initiatives targeting males might focus on age-specific precipitating circumstances in addition to standard psychiatric markers.
