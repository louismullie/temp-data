## Question

Should psa be checked for patient less than 4o on testosterone therapy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether PSA testing should be performed in men younger than 40 years who are starting or already receiving testosterone therapy, and if so, how to monitor. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what major guidelines say about baseline PSA testing before testosterone therapy. Then, I should verify whether any guideline recommends routine PSA testing in men under 40. Next, I will examine the biological rationale for PSA changes with testosterone and whether that meaningfully alters risk in younger men. After that, I should review any exceptions, such as high-risk features or concerning symptoms. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation and monitoring plan, making sure I confirm thresholds and follow-up intervals against the cited sources.

> Let me first confirm the baseline principle. The American Urological Association (AUA) recommends measuring PSA prior to testosterone therapy in men over 40 years of age to minimize the risk of treating occult prostate cancer, which establishes a clear age-based threshold for routine pre-therapy PSA testing [^115GXqPj]. The Endocrine Society similarly directs prostate risk assessment and monitoring discussions toward men aged 40–69, particularly those at increased risk, and explicitly notes that men under 40 do not need prostate monitoring, which supports the inference that routine PSA is not indicated under age 40 [^111qnJmQ]. The European Academy of Andrology (EAA) likewise frames pre-therapy PSA and DRE discussions for patients older than 40 years, reinforcing the same age threshold [^116YDLng].

> Wait, let me verify whether any major guideline deviates from this age cutoff. I should double-check the AUA, Endocrine Society, and EAA documents for any recommendation to screen men under 40 routinely. I find no recommendation for routine PSA testing in men younger than 40 in these sources, and the Endocrine Society explicitly states men under 40 do not need prostate monitoring, which aligns with the AUA's focus on men over 40 for baseline PSA [^111qnJmQ] [^115GXqPj] [^116YDLng].

> Next, I should review the biological rationale. Testosterone therapy can modestly increase PSA on average by roughly 0.3–0.44 ng/mL, with a 90% confidence limit for change around 1.4 ng/mL over 3–6 months, and this small upward shift is more clinically meaningful when baseline PSA is higher or when age-related cancer risk is present [^113j9dCc]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; in men under 40, baseline PSA is typically very low, so even a proportional increase rarely reaches thresholds that would trigger concern or biopsy, and the absolute risk of clinically significant prostate cancer in this age group is extremely low, which further reduces the yield of routine PSA screening under 40 [^113vp2r3] [^1161KR4c].

> I need to ensure I consider exceptions. If the patient has specific high-risk features such as a strong family history, known genetic risk, or suspicious urinary or rectal symptoms, then individualized consideration of PSA and urologic evaluation may be reasonable despite age, but this is not a routine screening recommendation and should be framed as risk-adapted care rather than standard practice for all men under 40 [^111qnJmQ] [^112qL6SV]. But wait, what if baseline PSA is already elevated for age? Even then, the guidance emphasizes confirming elevations and applying standard thresholds and referral rules rather than instituting routine PSA screening solely due to testosterone therapy in this age group [^115Sguu5] [^1162mjrC].

> Let me synthesize the clinical recommendation. For a man younger than 40 years starting or receiving testosterone therapy, routine PSA testing is not recommended. Pre-therapy PSA is not required solely based on age under 40, and on-treatment PSA monitoring is not indicated unless clinical risk factors or symptoms arise. If the patient has risk factors or concerning findings, then a shared decision-making discussion and individualized testing may be appropriate, but this remains the exception rather than the rule [^115GXqPj] [^111qnJmQ] [^116YDLng].

> I should confirm the practical monitoring plan. Standard testosterone therapy monitoring should focus on symptom response, serum testosterone, and hematocrit at 3–6 months, 12 months, and annually thereafter, with prostate evaluation reserved for men over 40 or those with specific risk features or abnormalities on exam or history. If prostate monitoring is pursued in higher-risk men, the Endocrine Society suggests baseline PSA and DRE with reassessment at 3–12 months, but again, this applies to men 40–69 or those at increased risk, not to routine care under age 40 [^116F2R6D] [^113JLyiw] [^111qnJmQ].

> Hold on, I should verify that I am not overlooking any labeling language that might imply universal PSA testing. FDA labeling for testosterone products advises evaluating patients for prostate cancer, including PSA, prior to and during treatment, which is a general caution and does not supersede guideline-based, age- and risk-adapted screening. In practice, professional society guidelines appropriately narrow routine PSA use to older or higher-risk men, aligning evidence-based care with population risk [^114nT7EH] [^115GXqPj] [^111qnJmQ].

> Bottom line, after reviewing the guidelines and evidence, I should conclude clearly: No, routine PSA testing is not recommended for men under 40 years of age who are starting or receiving testosterone therapy, absent specific high-risk features or concerning symptoms. Management should be individualized if red flags are present, but standard care does not include PSA screening in this age group [^115GXqPj] [^111qnJmQ] [^116YDLng].

---

Routine PSA testing is **not recommended** for men under 40 on testosterone therapy unless they have specific risk factors (e.g. family history, African ancestry, or suspicious symptoms) [^111qnJmQ]. The AUA and Endocrine Society advise **no routine PSA screening** under 40, even on TRT, because prostate cancer is rare and PSA changes are typically small in this age group [^111qnJmQ]. If PSA is checked, use the same thresholds as for older men, but **routine monitoring is not indicated** [^1162mjrC].

---

## Guidelines and recommendations

Major guidelines provide **clear guidance** on PSA testing in younger men on testosterone therapy:

- **AUA guidelines**: Recommend PSA measurement before starting testosterone therapy in men over 40, but do not recommend routine PSA testing in men under 40, even on testosterone therapy [^115GXqPj].

- **Endocrine Society guidelines**: State that men under 40 do not need prostate monitoring, including PSA testing, unless they have specific risk factors or symptoms [^111qnJmQ].

- **European Academy of Andrology (EAA) guidelines**: Emphasize shared decision-making and routine PSA testing primarily in men over 40, with no specific recommendations for routine PSA testing in men under 40 on testosterone therapy [^116YDLng].

---

## Evidence regarding PSA levels and prostate cancer risk in younger men

Research shows that **prostate cancer is rare in men under 40**, and routine PSA screening in this age group has limited utility. Key points include:

- **Low incidence**: Prostate cancer is uncommon in men under 40, making routine PSA screening less beneficial in this age group [^1161KR4c].

- **Small PSA changes**: Testosterone therapy typically causes only modest increases in PSA levels (average increase ~0.3 ng/mL in younger men), which are unlikely to indicate clinically significant prostate pathology [^113j9dCc].

- **No established link**: There is no established evidence linking testosterone therapy to increased prostate cancer risk in younger men [^notfound].

---

## Potential benefits and risks of PSA testing in younger men on testosterone therapy

### Benefits

Potential benefits include **early detection** of rare prostate abnormalities or cancers, though this is uncommon in men under 40. Baseline PSA measurement may also establish an individual's normal range for future reference.

---

### Risks

- **False positives**: PSA elevations can lead to unnecessary anxiety, further testing, and potential biopsies, which carry risks of infection, bleeding, and other complications [^1132JUcG].

- **Overdiagnosis**: Routine PSA testing in low-risk populations may lead to overdiagnosis and overtreatment of indolent cancers that would not significantly impact health outcomes [^113AusNv].

- **Limited clinical utility**: Given the low incidence of prostate cancer in men under 40, routine PSA testing may result in more harm than benefit.

---

## Clinical scenarios warranting PSA testing in younger men on testosterone therapy

While routine PSA testing is not recommended, certain clinical scenarios may **warrant consideration**:

- **Family history**: Strong family history of prostate cancer or genetic predisposition (e.g. BRCA mutations) [^111qnJmQ].

- **Ethnicity**: African ancestry, which carries a higher risk of prostate cancer [^111qnJmQ].

- **Suspicious symptoms**: Presence of urinary symptoms, hematospermia, or other prostate-related symptoms [^113jnCfE].

- **Baseline elevation**: Significant baseline PSA elevation or abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE) findings [^117U794P].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Psa testing recommended?** |
|-|-|
| General population under 40 on testosterone therapy | No |
| Family history or genetic predisposition | Yes |
| African ancestry | Yes |
| Suspicious symptoms (e.g. hematospermia) | Yes |
| Baseline PSA elevation or abnormal DRE | Yes |

---

Routine PSA testing is **not recommended** for men under 40 on testosterone therapy unless specific risk factors or symptoms are present. The decision should be individualized, with shared decision-making between the patient and clinician.

### Prostate safety events during testosterone replacement therapy… [^112BCWsj]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Change in IPSS did not differ between groups. The PSA concentrations increased more in testosterone-treated than placebo-treated men. Conclusions and Relevance In a population of middle-aged and older men with hypogonadism, carefully evaluated to exclude those at high risk of prostate cancer, the incidences of high-grade or any prostate cancer and other prostate events were low and did not differ significantly between testosterone- and placebo-treated men. The study's findings may facilitate a more informed appraisal of the potential risks of TRT. A PSA cutoff of 3 ng/mL was established to exclude men at increased prostate cancer risk. 19 Participants were randomized in a 1: 1 ratio with stratification for preexisting CVD to receive 1. 62% transdermal testosterone gel or matching placebo gel for the duration of the study.

Changes over time in IPSSs, PSA levels, and hormone levels were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models with fixed effects for treatment, visit, treatment × visit interaction, baseline value, CVD status, and a random-subject effect using an unstructured covariance. Least-squares means estimates, 95% CIs, and P values for treatment effect were computed using an F test. For PSA, a mixed model was used to test whether treatment difference continued to increase after month 12 by comparing month 12 with the mean of later visits. All hypothesis tests used a 2-sided significance level of P <.
05. Consistent with meta-analyses of smaller testosterone trials, TRT did not increase IPSSs. 14, 27 Although PSA concentrations increased more among the TRT group than the placebo group, the mean increase was small and between-group difference did not widen after 12 months.

Thus, in a population men with hypogonadism and PSA concentrations less than 3 ng/mL who were evaluated carefully to exclude those at increased prostate cancer risk, TRT was associated with low risk of adverse prostate events, including cancer. lead to prostate biopsy and detection of a subclinical low-grade prostate cancer. 1 To minimize the risk of unnecessary prostate biopsies and mitigate ascertainment bias, while enabling detection of prostate cancers for which clinical management may reduce long-term disease-related morbidity and mortality, the study protocol specified PSA elevation thresholds for referral to a urologist. 21, 31 Elevations in PSA concentrations above these thresholds were verified, and participants with confirmed PSA elevation were asked to watch a video on the significance of PSA elevation and the benefits and risks of prostate biopsy to facilitate a shared decision on prostate biopsy.

6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Testosterone gel, 1.62% was evaluated in a two-phase, 364-day, controlled clinical study. The first phase was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled period of 182 days, in which 234 hypogonadal men were treated with testosterone gel, 1.62% and 40 received placebo. Patients could continue in an open-label, non-comparative, maintenance period for an additional 182 days [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

The most common adverse reaction reported in the double-blind period was increased prostate specific antigen (PSA) reported in 26 testosterone gel, 1.62%-treated patients (11.1%). In 17 patients, increased PSA was considered an adverse event by meeting one of the two pre-specified criteria for abnormal PSA values, defined as (1) average serum PSA > 4 ng/mL based on two separate determinations, or (2) an average change from baseline in serum PSA of greater than 0.75 ng/mL on two determinations.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111qnJmQ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Testosterone therapy — prostate cancer screening and monitoring when considering treatment: The baseline evaluation should identify and exclude men with a history of prostate cancer or those at high risk, and organizations strongly encourage shared decision making regarding screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and digital rectal examination (DRE). Clinicians should consider screening and monitoring for all hypogonadal men who are 55 to 69 years of age, are being considered for T-replacement therapy, are in excellent health, and have a life expectancy > 10 years. This should start at age 40 in higher-risk men (such as African Americans and those with a first-degree male relative with prostate cancer). Men < 40 years do not need prostate monitoring, and in men diagnosed > 70 years of age, the risk of death from prostate cancer is not high enough to warrant monitoring. Baseline risk assessment should consider age, family history, race, prior biopsy, elevated PSA, and examination findings; clinicians can estimate risk using a prostate cancer risk calculator.

### Endocrine treatment of gender-dysphoric / gender-incongruent persons: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1161KR4c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

Transgender females on estrogens — prostatic disease screening — We suggest that transgender females treated with estrogens follow individualized screening according to personal risk for prostatic disease and prostate cancer. Prostate cancer is very rare before the age of 40, and studies have reported cases of benign prostatic hyperplasia in transgender females treated with estrogens for 20 to 25 years and a few cases of prostate carcinoma in transgender females. Thus, it may be reasonable for transgender females who transitioned after age 20 years to have annual screening digital rectal examinations after age 50 years and prostate-specific antigen tests consistent with U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Guidelines.

During the 182-day, double-blind period of the clinical trial, the mean change in serum PSA value was 0.14 ng/mL for patients receiving testosterone gel, 1.62% and -0.12 ng/mL for the patients in the placebo group. During the double-blind period, seven patients had a PSA value > 4.0 ng/mL, four of these seven patients had PSA less than or equal to 4.0 ng/mL upon repeat testing. The other three patients did not undergo repeat PSA testing.

During the 182-day, open-label period of the study, the mean change in serum PSA values was 0.10 ng/mL for both patients continuing on active therapy and patients transitioning onto active from placebo. During the open-label period, three patients had a serum PSA value > 4.0 ng/mL, two of whom had a serum PSA less than or equal to 4.0 ng/mL upon repeated testing. The other patient did not undergo repeat PSA testing. Among previous placebo patients, 3 of 28 (10.7%), had increased PSA as an adverse event in the open-label period.

Table 4 shows adverse reactions reported by > 2% of patients in the 182-day, double-blind period of the testosterone gel, 1.62% clinical trial and more frequent in the testosterone gel, 1.62% treated group versus placebo.

5.5 Laboratory Tests

Regular assessments of serum Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) may be helpful in monitoring the patient's response. If PSA levels rise during bicalutamide therapy, the patient should be evaluated for clinical progression. For patients who have objective progression of disease together with an elevated PSA, a treatment-free period of antiandrogen, while continuing the LHRH analog, may be considered.

Monitoring of testosterone-replacement therapy — evaluation and laboratory schedule: In hypogonadal men who have started testosterone therapy, we recommend evaluating the patient after treatment initiation to assess whether the patient has responded to treatment, is suffering any adverse effects, and is complying with the treatment regimen (Ungraded Good Practice Statement). Clinicians should maintain serum testosterone concentrations during treatment in the mid-normal range for healthy young men, evaluate symptoms and formulation-specific adverse events at each visit, and measure testosterone and hematocrit at 3 to 6 months, at 12 months, and annually thereafter; for those who choose prostate monitoring, include PSA and DRE 3 to 12 months.

Increases in Serum PSA

The mean increase from baseline in PSA was 0.2 ng/mL (n = 161). Increases in serum PSA concentrations, defined as an increase from baseline of at least 1.4 ng/mL or PSA greater than 4 ng/mL, occurred in 3 (1.9%) of the patients at the final visit.

Cardiovascular Outcomes

TRAVERSE was a randomized, double-blind, cardiovascular outcomes study to assess the cardiovascular (CV) safety of topical testosterone gel compared to placebo in 5198 hypogonadal men aged 45 to 80 years with a history of CV disease or with multiple CV risk factors. The primary outcome was the incidence of the composite endpoint of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), consisting of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and non-fatal stroke.

The mean duration of therapy was approximately 22 months. The mean duration of follow-up was 33 months. Approximately 61% of all patients discontinued topical testosterone gel or placebo therapy.

The mean patient age (± SD) was 63.3 (7.9) years, with 2452 patients aged 65 years or more (47%); 2847 (about 55%) patients had pre-existing cardiovascular disease, whereas 2357 patients (about 45%) had an elevated cardiovascular risk at baseline, and mean BMI was 35kg/m2. Approximately 80% of patients were White, 17% were Black, and 3% were of other races or ethnic groups. Approximately 69%, 84%, and 93% had diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension, respectively.

### Testosterone gel, 1% [^117WYhRL]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Twenty-nine patients (18%) met the per-protocol criterion for increase in serum PSA, defined as greater than 2X the baseline or any single serum PSA greater than 6 ng/mL. Most of these (25/29) met this criterion by at least doubling of their PSA from baseline. In most cases where PSA at least doubled (22/25), the maximum serum PSA value was still less than 2 ng/mL. The first occurrence of a pre-specified, post-baseline increase in serum PSA was seen at or prior to Month 12 in most of the patients who met this criterion (23 of 29; 79%).

Four patients met this criterion by having a serum PSA greater than 6 ng/mL and in these, maximum serum PSA values were 6.2 ng/mL, 6.6 ng/mL, 6.7 ng/mL, and 10.7 ng/mL. In two of these patients, prostate cancer was detected on biopsy. The first patient's PSA levels were 4.7 ng/mL and 6.2 ng/mL at baseline and at Month 6/Final, respectively. The second patient's PSA levels were 4.2 ng/mL, 5.2 ng/mL, 5.8 ng/mL, and 6.6 ng/mL at baseline, Month 6, Month 12, and Final, respectively.

5.1 Polycythemia

Increases in hematocrit levels, reflective of increases in red blood cell mass, may require discontinuation of TLANDO. Check hematocrit prior to initiating TLANDO. Evaluate hematocrit approximately every 3 months during the first year of treatment, and then every 6 months thereafter while the patient is taking TLANDO. If hematocrit becomes elevated, stop TLANDO until hematocrit decreases to an acceptable concentration. If TLANDO is restarted and again causes hematocrit to become elevated, stop TLANDO permanently. An increase in red blood cell mass may increase the risk of thromboembolic events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

5.2 Venous Thromboembolism

There have been post marketing reports of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients using testosterone replacement products such as TLANDO.

In the Testosterone Replacement therapy for Assessment of long-term Vascular Events and efficacy ResponSE in hypogonadal men (TRAVERSE) Study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cardiovascular (CV) outcomes study, compared to placebo, topical testosterone gel was associated with a numerically higher incidence of VTE (1.7% vs 1.2%) which included DVT (0.6% vs 0.5%) and PE events (0.9% vs 0.5%) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Evaluate patients who report symptoms of pain, edema, warmth, and erythema in the lower extremity for DVT and those who present with acute shortness of breath for PE. If a venous thromboembolic event is suspected, discontinue TLANDO and initiate appropriate workup and management [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.3 Worsening of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and Potential Risk of Prostate Cancer

Patients with BPH treated with androgens are at an increased risk for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. Monitor patients with BPH for worsening signs and symptoms.

5.1 Worsening of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and Potential Risk of Prostate Cancer

Monitor patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH.
Patients treated with Androgens may be at increased risk for prostate cancer. Evaluate patients for prostate cancer prior to initiating treatment. It would be appropriate to reevaluate patients 3 to 6 months after initiation of treatment, and then in accordance with prostate cancer screening practices. [See Contraindications (4)].

5.2 Potential for Secondary Exposure to Testosterone

Cases of secondary exposure to testosterone in children and women have been reported with topical testosterone products applied to the abdomen or upper arms, including cases of secondary exposure resulting in virilization of children. Signs and symptoms have included enlargement of the penis or clitoris, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases, these signs and symptoms regressed with removal of the exposure to testosterone. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age-appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. The risk of transfer was increased in some of these cases by not adhering to precautions for the appropriate use of the topical testosterone product. Children and women should avoid contact with unwashed or unclothed application sites in men using AXIRON [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Inappropriate changes in genital size or development of pubic hair or libido in children, or changes in body hair distribution, significant increase in acne, or other signs of virilization in adult women should be brought to the attention of a physician and the possibility of secondary exposure to testosterone should also be brought to the attention of a physician. Testosterone therapy should be promptly discontinued at least until the cause of virilization has been identified. [See Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

5.3 Polycythemia

Increases in hematocrit, reflective of increases in red blood cell mass, may require lowering or discontinuation of testosterone. Check hematocrit prior to initiating testosterone treatment. It would be appropriate to re-evaluate the hematocrit 3 to 6 months after starting testosterone treatment, and then annually. If hematocrit becomes elevated, stop therapy until hematocrit decreases to an acceptable level. An increase in red blood cell mass may increase the risk of thromboembolic events.

6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

AndroGel 1.62% was evaluated in a two-phase, 364-day, controlled clinical study. The first phase was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled period of 182 days, in which 234 hypogonadal men were treated with AndroGel 1.62% and 40 received placebo. Patients could continue in an open-label, non-comparative, maintenance period for an additional 182 days [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

The most common adverse reaction reported in the double-blind period was increased prostate specific antigen (PSA) reported in 26 AndroGel 1.62%-treated patients (11.1%). In 17 patients, increased PSA was considered an adverse event by meeting one of the two pre-specified criteria for abnormal PSA values, defined as (1) average serum PSA > 4 ng/mL based on two separate determinations, or (2) an average change from baseline in serum PSA of greater than 0.75 ng/mL on two determinations.

Radiation therapy recurrence — monitoring and management: Monitoring should include physical exam, PSA every 3–6 mo, and imaging for symptoms or increasing PSA. Document castrate levels of testosterone if clinically indicated, and workup for progression should include bone and soft tissue evaluation. Treatment for patients with life expectancy < 5 y whose cancer progressed on observation of localized disease is ADT. For patients with PSA progression who have not received treatment for a first BCR, continue monitoring or consider treatment for first PSA persistence/recurrence. PSADT can be calculated to inform nomogram use and counseling, and PSADT and Grade Group should be considered when deciding whether to begin ADT. Treatment for first biochemical recurrence has historically been referred to as "salvage" therapy; the guidelines refer to this setting as "secondary" therapy.

### Occult prostate cancer in men with low serum testosterone levels… [^113RrFGZ]. JAMA Network (1996). Excellent credibility.

Objective. — To determine the prevalence of occult prostate cancer in men with low serum total testosterone or free testosterone levels. Design. — Retrospective analysis of a consecutive series of men. Setting. — Academic teaching hospital. Patients. — Seventy-seven men with low total testosterone or free testosterone levels, with normal results of digital rectal examination and prostate-specific antigen levels of 4. 0 ng/mL or less. The mean age was 58 years. Interventions. — Sextant prostate needle biopsies with ultrasound guidance. Main Outcome Measures. — Results of prostate needle biopsies, transrectal ultrasound, prostate volume, PSA level, PSA density, total and free testosterone levels. Results. — Prostate cancer was identified in 14% of the entire group and in 10 men aged 60 years or older. The median age for men with cancer was 64 years. Histologic examination showed Gleason scores of 6 or 7 for all cancers.

No significant differences were noted between the cancer and benign groups with regard to PSA level, PSA density, prostate volume, total testosterone level, or free testosterone level. Conclusions. — A high prevalence of biopsy-detectable prostate cancer was identified in men with low total or free testosterone levels despite normal PSA levels and results of digital rectal examination. These data suggest that digital rectal examination and PSA levels are insensitive indicators of prostate cancer in men with low total or free testosterone levels, and PSA levels may be altered by naturally occurring reductions in serum androgen levels.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113j9dCc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Testosterone therapy — prostate-specific antigen (PSA) changes and referral thresholds state that T-replacement therapy increases PSA concentrations in hypogonadal men, with a systematic review finding the average PSA increase after initiating T therapy was 0.3 ng/mL in young hypogonadal men and 0.44 ng/mL in older men; the 90% confidence limit was 1.4 ng/mL for the change in PSA concentrations between two PSA tests performed 3 to 6 months apart in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia, and increases > 1.4 ng/mL during 3 to 6 months after T therapy in hypogonadal men are unusual. In the TTrials, PSA increases > 1.4 ng/mL occurred in 2.4% of men at 3 months and 4.7% of men at 12 months in the T group and 1.6% and 0.6%, respectively, in the placebo group. A confirmed PSA > 4.0 ng/mL is a widely accepted indication for urological evaluation for prostate cancer, and because some hypogonadal men with baseline PSA between 2.6 and 4 ng/mL will develop PSA concentrations > 4.0 ng/mL after initiating T treatment, in hypogonadal men treated with T whose baseline PSA was between 2.6 and 4 ng/mL, we suggest clinicians consider both a confirmed increase of > 1.4 ng/mL in PSA concentration above baseline and the absolute PSA level when deciding to refer the patient for further urological evaluation; clinicians should confirm PSA elevations by repeating the test.

### Rationale… [^113AusNv]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

USPSTF ASSESSMENT PSA-based screening for prostate cancer has both potential benefits and harms. The USPSTF does not recommend screening for prostate cancer unless men express a preference for screening after being informed of and understanding the benefits and risks. The decision about whether to be screened for prostate cancer requires that each man incorporate his own values about the potential benefits and harms. 8–10 Four ERSPC trial sites reported data on the effect of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer on the development of metastatic cancer after 12 years of follow-up. The risk of developing metastatic prostate cancer was 30% lower among men randomized to screening than among men in the control group. This translates to an absolute reduction in the long-term risk of metastatic prostate cancer of 3.

1 cases per 1, 000 men screened. In Sweden, where a low PSA threshold was used to determine a positive test result and men were screened every 2 years, more than 45% of men who participated in all screening rounds had a false-positive result over 10 years of screening. The USPSTF considered whether there are screening and follow-up approaches that increase the potential for benefit while reducing the potential for harms. Variation across sites in randomized trials of screening suggests there may be greater mortality benefit from screening every other year compared with longer intervals and from using lower PSA thresholds for diagnostic biopsy. Although these approaches may have increased the potential benefit reported in studies, they also resulted in substantially more harms — more false-positive results, more prostate biopsies, and more cases of overdiagnosis.

This trade-off was also observed in a review of decision analysis models; screening protocols using lower PSA thresholds for biopsy and more frequent screening intervals offered greater potential reductions in prostate cancer mortality but higher rates of overdiagnosis and other harms. 14 The frequency of screening in the ERSPC sites ranged from every 2 to 7 years. No ERSPC trial site offered screening more often than every 2 years, and many sites screened every 4 years. The PSA threshold for biopsy in the ERSPC sites ranged from 2. 5 to 4 ng/mL.

### Adult-onset hypogonadism [^113SbDPc]. Mayo Clinic Proceedings (2016). Medium credibility.

Adult-onset hypogonadism (AOH) — treatment and follow-up for men administered testosterone therapy (TT) includes branching by fertility goals and specified monitoring. For those with a desire to maintain fertility, stimulation of endogenous testosterone secretion (if luteinizing hormone is not elevated) with selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM) or human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is outlined; for those with no desire to maintain fertility, testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) follows discussion of risks/benefits of various formulations. Follow-up at 3 and 6 months, then annually assesses signs/symptoms, weight, total testosterone (TT), hematocrit (Hct), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA); at 6 months, if total T < 400 ng/dL and no improvement, then consider dose increase with reassessment in another 3–6 months. If hematocrit > 54%, then stop TRT until Hct decreases to a safe level, evaluate for hypoxia and sleep apnea, and reinstate TRT at a reduced dose. Bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine and/or femoral neck is measured after 1–2 years of TRT in men with osteoporosis or low trauma fracture. In men aged ≥ 40 years with baseline PSA > 0.6 ng/mL, perform digital rectal examination (DRE) and check PSA before TRT, at 3 to 6 months, and then based on prostate cancer screening guidelines. Evaluate formulation-specific adverse events at each follow-up visit, and if not improved after 3–6 months, consider discontinuation and search for other causes/treatments.

### Testosterone treatment in adult men with age-related low testosterone: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^112Mz5gH]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

American College of Physicians GRADE framework — grading certainty of evidence and recommendations is defined as follows: High certainty is described as "Confident that the true effect is close to the estimated effect", Moderate certainty is "Moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely close to the estimated effect, but there is a sizeable possibility that it is substantially different", and Low certainty is "Confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimated effect". Recommendation strength includes Strong, where there is "Confidence that benefits clearly outweigh risks and burden or vice versa", it "Applies to most patients in most circumstances", and "Only strong recommendations should be considered as quality indicators to guide the development of accountability, reporting, and payment programs"; and Conditional, where "Benefits probably outweigh risks and burden, or vice versa, but there is appreciable uncertainty", it "Applies to many patients but may differ depending on circumstances or patients' values and preferences", and "Policy making will require substantial debates and involvement of many stakeholders. Policies are also more likely to vary between regions. Quality indicators would have to focus on the fact that adequate deliberation about the management options has taken place".

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1132JUcG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Testosterone therapy — prostate cancer detection, biopsy harms, and screening yield: Testosterone therapy increases detection of subclinical prostate cancer via increased surveillance and PSA rise, and a meta-analysis found a greater proportion of men randomized to T had prostate biopsies than those assigned to placebo. Prostate biopsy may cause pain, fever, bleeding, infection, transient urinary difficulties, psychological harms, and overdiagnosis, and prostate cancer treatment can result in erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, bowel dysfunction, and a small risk of premature death. In long-term screening follow-up, PSA-based screening prevents one to two men from dying of prostate cancer for every 1000 men screened, and screening 1000 men 55 to 69 years of age may prevent approximately three men from developing metastatic prostate cancer; therefore, it is important to establish standardized monitoring and referral criteria during T treatment to minimize unnecessary testing.

Testosterone therapy and prostate cancer — evidence summary and core recommendation: The relationship between testosterone (T) administration and prostate cancer risk remains poorly understood and no RCT has been long or large enough to determine whether T increases risk; epidemiologic studies report no significant association between endogenous T concentrations and prostate cancer risk. Because androgen receptor signaling is central in prostate cancer biology and T administration promotes growth of metastatic prostate cancer, the guideline states, we recommend against T supplementation in men with prostate cancer and suggest assessing prostate cancer risk prior to treatment initiation.
