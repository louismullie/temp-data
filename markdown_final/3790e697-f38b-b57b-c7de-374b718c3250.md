## Question

Evans syndrome

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Evans syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining Evans syndrome and its diagnostic criteria. Then, I should verify epidemiology and prognosis. Next, I will examine pathophysiology and secondary causes. After that, I need to review diagnostic workup, including when to suspect inborn errors of immunity. Then, I will appraise treatment strategies by line of therapy, including special populations. Finally, I should consider complications, supportive care, and future directions, and close with a concise synthesis that aligns with consensus guidance [^fecc96b3].

> Let me first confirm the definition and diagnostic criteria. Evans syndrome is the simultaneous or sequential occurrence of two or more autoimmune cytopenias, most commonly autoimmune hemolytic anemia and immune thrombocytopenia, with or without autoimmune neutropenia, in the absence of an alternative explanation, and the direct antiglobulin test is typically positive in AIHA, which helps anchor the diagnosis when present [^fecc96b3] [^e1bf8153] [^21d2e8f5].

> Wait, let me verify the epidemiology and prognosis before drawing conclusions. Adult ES is rare, with an incidence around 1–9 per million per year and a prevalence near 21 per million in Denmark, and it carries high morbidity and mortality; median overall survival is approximately 7.2 years overall, with markedly worse outcomes in secondary ES, where 5-year survival can be as low as 38% [^736bea0a]. Hold on, I should also note pediatric data: long-term follow-up shows 15-year survival around 84%, but mortality clusters in adolescence and young adulthood, often from infection or treatment toxicity rather than active cytopenias, underscoring the need for vigilant supportive care and transition planning [^69b037a5] [^ded56db8].

> I need to check the pathophysiology and secondary associations. ES reflects immune dysregulation with autoantibodies against platelets and erythrocytes, and in children, a substantial fraction harbor underlying inborn errors of immunity or other genetic defects, whereas in adults, secondary ES is common and linked to systemic autoimmune disease, lymphoproliferative disorders, and occasionally solid organ transplantation or malignancy; thrombotic risk is increased, likely from hemolysis-related nitric oxide depletion and procoagulant young platelets, and antiphospholipid antibodies are not rare in adult cohorts [^68a6bc10] [^2faeac90] [^69a7f43a] [^9cda9ffc].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic workup and when to suspect IEI. Let me think about the essentials: confirm cytopenias with peripheral smear, reticulocyte count, and DAT to characterize warm versus cold AIHA; evaluate for secondary causes with ANA, antiphospholipid testing, HIV, HBV, HCV, and consider chest/abdominal CT to exclude lymphoproliferative disease; in children and selected adults with early onset, recurrent infections, or family history, targeted genetic testing for IEI is reasonable given the higher yield in pediatrics and the therapeutic implications for HSCT or targeted therapies [^fecc96b3] [^c008dbcb] [^68a6bc10].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment without aligning to consensus. First-line therapy is corticosteroids with or without IVIG, with early IVIG associated with lower early relapse risk in adults; rituximab is strongly recommended as first-line in cold-type AIHA and as second-line in warm-type AIHA or ITP, particularly with antiphospholipid antibodies, prior thrombosis, or lymphoproliferative disease; splenectomy is now reserved for third-line or later due to infection risk and inferior durability in ES; TPO receptor agonists are appropriate for chronic ITP within ES; fostamatinib is a reasonable third-line option; and HSCT is curative but high risk and should be reserved for refractory disease after rituximab and TPO-RA failure in carefully selected patients [^fecc96b3] [^e68530c7] [^6304ef14] [^7a7e8a72].

> I should double-check special populations and nuances. In children, rituximab is effective but responses may be less durable than in isolated AIHA, and mycophenolate mofetil can be a steroid-sparing alternative; given the high prevalence of IEI, early genetic evaluation and transition programs are critical; in adults with secondary ES, treat the underlying condition when feasible and tailor immunosuppression to comorbidities; in pregnancy or severe bleeding, prioritize rapid platelet recovery with IVIG and steroids while coordinating obstetric and hematology care [^3f8df5d3] [^68a6bc10] [^fecc96b3].

> But wait, what about complications and supportive care that change outcomes. Infections and thromboses occur in roughly one-third and one-fifth of adults, respectively, and correlate with mortality; therefore, infection prophylaxis with vaccination, antiviral and antibacterial strategies in immunosuppressed patients, and thromboprophylaxis in hyperhemolytic states are prudent; transfusion thresholds should balance bleeding risk against hemolysis, and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents can help when reticulocytes are inadequate; I should confirm that consensus supports these measures, which it does [^fecc96b3] [^6cdde792] [^69a7f43a].

> Let me reconsider the role of novel agents so I don't overstate unproven therapies. BTK inhibition with orelabrutinib shows promising early results in refractory AIHA/ES, and anti-CD38 approaches targeting plasma cells are under investigation; given the pathogenic contribution of long-lived plasma cells in some refractory cases, these strategies are mechanistically compelling but require prospective validation before routine use [^41f76331] [^cadaaaa8].

> I should confirm the key takeaways and ensure internal consistency. Evans syndrome is a rare, often severe autoimmune cytopenia syndrome with high relapse and complication rates; management is multimodal and escalation-prone, so early, structured diagnostic workup for secondary causes and IEI, judicious use of rituximab, avoidance of early splenectomy, and proactive infection and thrombosis prevention are central to improving outcomes; pediatric-onset disease carries a distinct trajectory with accumulating immunopathology over time, demanding longitudinal, multidisciplinary care and transition planning [^fecc96b3] [^68a6bc10] [^69b037a5].

Evans syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder defined by **simultaneous or sequential immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA)** [^e1bf8153], with or without autoimmune neutropenia [^f9b7d6d2]. It is a diagnosis of exclusion [^aed99349] and carries a **high relapse rate** [^2faeac90], frequent infections, and thrombotic complications [^ef033cd4], with worse outcomes in secondary forms [^736bea0a]. First-line therapy is corticosteroids with or without IVIG [^fecc96b3]; rituximab is a key second-line option [^6304ef14], and TPO receptor agonists are used for persistent thrombocytopenia [^f26c15e3]. Splenectomy is less effective and reserved for refractory cases [^e1bf8153]; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is considered for severe, refractory disease [^7a7e8a72]. Prognosis is guarded, with median survival around 7–10 years in adults [^736bea0a] and higher mortality in secondary disease [^736bea0a].

---

## Pathophysiology

Evans syndrome is characterized by **autoimmune destruction** of multiple hematopoietic lineages, primarily platelets and erythrocytes, mediated by autoantibodies and immune complexes [^e1bf8153]. The exact etiology is unknown, but it is believed to involve **B-cell dysregulation** [^708a076f] and loss of immune tolerance, leading to production of autoantibodies against platelet glycoproteins and erythrocyte membrane proteins [^cadaaaa8]. Genetic predisposition and environmental triggers, such as infections or medications, may contribute to disease initiation and exacerbations [^b940d6ee].

---

## Clinical presentation

Patients typically present with **symptoms of thrombocytopenia** (easy bruising, petechiae, mucosal bleeding) and **hemolytic anemia** (fatigue, pallor, jaundice, dark urine) [^b7afd6d2]. The onset may be acute or chronic, and the two cytopenias can occur simultaneously or sequentially [^e1bf8153]. Autoimmune neutropenia, if present, may lead to recurrent infections [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and evaluation

Diagnosis of Evans syndrome is based on the following criteria:

- **Concurrent or sequential presence of ITP and AIHA**, confirmed by laboratory tests [^e1bf8153].
- **Positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT)** for AIHA, indicating the presence of autoantibodies or complement on erythrocytes [^b7afd6d2].
- **Exclusion of other causes** of thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia, including hereditary, infectious, malignant, or drug-induced etiologies [^fecc96b3].

Laboratory evaluation includes:

- Complete blood count (CBC) with reticulocyte count [^b7afd6d2].
- Peripheral blood smear (schistocytes, spherocytes, reticulocytosis) [^b7afd6d2].
- Direct antiglobulin test (DAT) [^b7afd6d2].
- Liver function tests (indirect hyperbilirubinemia, elevated LDH) [^b7afd6d2].
- Autoimmune screening (ANA, anti-dsDNA, antiphospholipid antibodies) [^9a9687b5].
- Viral serologies (HIV, hepatitis B and C, Epstein-Barr virus) [^6cdde792].
- Bone marrow evaluation if indicated [^fecc96b3].

---

## Treatment strategies

Treatment of Evans syndrome is challenging due to the **high relapse rate** and frequent complications [^2faeac90]. Management is individualized based on disease severity, patient age, and presence of secondary underlying conditions [^fecc96b3].

---

### First-line therapy

First-line therapy consists of **corticosteroids** (prednisone 1 mg/kg/day) with or without intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) [^fecc96b3]. Corticosteroids suppress the immune response and reduce autoantibody production, while IVIG provides temporary elevation of platelet counts and modulation of immune function [^notfound].

---

### Second-line therapy

Second-line options include:

- **Rituximab**: A monoclonal antibody against CD20, effective in both ITP and AIHA, with response rates around 80% [^e68530c7] [^6304ef14].
- **Splenectomy**: Reserved for refractory cases due to lower efficacy and higher complication rates compared to isolated ITP or AIHA [^e1bf8153].
- **Immunosuppressive agents**: Mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, cyclosporine, and cyclophosphamide are options for refractory disease [^e1bf8153].

---

### Third-line and emerging therapies

Third-line and emerging therapies include **thrombopoietin receptor agonists** (eltrombopag, romiplostim) for persistent thrombocytopenia, with response rates around 80% [^f26c15e3] [^89411a34]. Fostamatinib, a spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is recommended as third-line or further-line therapy [^fecc96b3]. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is considered for severe, refractory cases, particularly in pediatric patients or those with underlying genetic defects [^7a7e8a72].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Evans syndrome has a guarded prognosis, with **high relapse rates** and significant morbidity and mortality [^2faeac90]. Complications include:

- **Frequent relapses**: Occurring in approximately 70% of patients [^notfound].
- **Infections**: Due to immunosuppressive therapy and underlying immune dysregulation [^6cdde792].
- **Thrombotic events**: Increased risk of venous and arterial thrombosis, particularly in adults [^69a7f43a].
- **Bleeding**: Persistent thrombocytopenia can lead to significant bleeding complications [^5402a09e].

Median survival in adults is approximately 7–10 years, with worse outcomes in secondary Evans syndrome and those requiring multiple lines of therapy [^736bea0a] [^ef033cd4].

---

## Recent advances and future directions

Recent advances include improved understanding of genetic predisposition, particularly in pediatric patients with underlying primary immunodeficiencies [^68a6bc10]. Targeted therapies, such as BTK inhibitors and complement inhibitors, are under investigation and may offer new therapeutic options [^41f76331]. International collaborative efforts and prospective registries are needed to standardize diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up protocols [^ef033cd4].

---

Evans syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by the coexistence of ITP and AIHA, with a complex pathophysiology and challenging clinical course. Management requires a **multidisciplinary approach**, individualized treatment plans, and close monitoring for complications. Recent advances in genetic understanding and targeted therapies offer hope for improved outcomes in the future.

### Diagnosis and management of Evans syndrome in adults: first consensus recommendations [^fecc96b3]. The Lancet: Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Evans syndrome is a rare disease marked by a severe clinical course, high relapse rate, infectious and thrombotic complications, and sometimes fatal outcome. Management is highly heterogeneous. There are several case reports but few large retrospective studies and no prospective or randomised trials. Here, we report the results of the first consensus-based expert recommendations aimed at harmonising the diagnosis and management of Evans syndrome in adults. After reviewing the literature, we used a fuzzy Delphi consensus method, with two rounds of a 42-item questionnaire that were scored by a panel of 13 international experts from five countries using a 7-point Likert scale. Panellists were selected by the core panel on the basis of their personal experience and previous publications on Evans syndrome and immune cytopenias; they met virtually throughout 2023. The panellists recommended extensive clinical and laboratory diagnostic tests, including bone marrow evaluation and CT scan, and an aggressive front-line therapy with prednisone (with or without intravenous immunoglobulins), with different treatment durations and tapering for immune thrombocytopenia and autoimmune haemolytic anaemias (AIHAs). Rituximab was strongly recommended as first-line treatment in cold-type AIHA and as second-line treatment in warm-type AIHA and patients with immune thrombocytopenia and antiphospholipid antibodies, previous thrombotic events, or associated lymphoproliferative diseases. However, rituximab was discouraged for patients with immunodeficiency or severe infections, with the same applying to splenectomy. Thrombopoietin receptor agonists were recommended for chronic immune thrombocytopenia and in the case of previous grade 4 infection. Fostamatinib was recommended as third-line or further-line treatment and suggested as second-line therapy for patients with previous thrombotic events. Immunosuppressive agents have been moved to third-line or further-line treatment. The panellists recommended the use of recombinant erythropoietin in AIHA in the case of inadequate reticulocyte counts, use of the complement inhibitor sutimlimab for relapsed cold AIHA, and the combination of rituximab plus bendamustine in Evans syndrome secondary to lymphoproliferative disorders. Finally, recommendations were given for supportive therapy, platelet or red blood cell transfusions, and thrombotic and antibiotic prophylaxis. These consensus-based recommendations should facilitate best practice for diagnosis and management of Evans syndrome in clinical practice.

### Paediatric-onset Evans syndrome: breaking away from refractory immune thrombocytopenia [^68a6bc10]. British Journal of Haematology (2023). Medium credibility.

Since its first description by Evans in 1951, this syndrome has been linked to chronic immune thrombocytopenia with the concurrent or delayed onset of autoimmune haemolytic anaemia or neutropenia. For decades, the evolution of Evans syndrome (ES) has carried a poor prognosis and often resulted in chronic steroid exposure, multiple immune suppressing medications directed against T or B lymphocytes, and splenectomy. This paper presents a new view of ES based on recent advances in genomics which begin to classify patients based on their underlying molecular variants in previously described primary immune disorders. This has opened up new avenues of targeted therapy or bone marrow transplant at rather than broad long-term immune suppression or splenectomy. Importantly, recent studies of the full lifespan of ES suggest that at least 80% of those paediatric patients will progress to various clinical or biological immunopathological manifestations with age despite the resolution of their cytopenias. Those patients merit long-term follow-up and monitoring in dedicated transition programs to improve outcome at the adult age.

### How I manage Evans syndrome and AIHA cases in children [^7cfeadf8]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

The management of Evans Syndrome in children is challenging due to the lack of evidence-based data on treatment. Steroids, the first-choice therapy, are successful in about 80% of cases. For children who are resistant, relapse or become steroid-dependent, rituximab is considered a valid second-line treatment, with the exception of those with an underlying diagnosis of autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome who may benefit from other options such as mycophenolate mofetil and sirolimus. Better knowledge of the immunological mechanisms underlying cytopenias and the availability of new immunosuppressive drugs can be helpful in the choice of more targeted therapies that would enable the reduction of the use of long-term steroid administration or other more aggressive options, such as splenectomy or stem cell transplantation. This manuscript provides an overview of the pathogenic background of the disease, and suggests a clinical approach to diagnosis and treatment with a particular focus on the management of relapsing/resistant disease.

### Evans syndrome in adults-incidence, prevalence, and survival in a nationwide cohort [^736bea0a]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients with Evans syndrome have both immune thrombocytopenia and autoimmune hemolytic anemia, but little is known about the epidemiology of this rare syndrome. Evans syndrome can be primary or secondary. This nationwide retrospective study linked health registries to identify 242 patients with Evans syndrome in Denmark in 1977–2017. For comparison, we identified three age-matched and sex-matched cohorts of patients with only immune thrombocytopenia or only autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and a general population cohort. The Evans syndrome cohort had a mean age of 58.5years at diagnosis, 51.2% were women, and 27.3% were classified as secondary Evans syndrome. The annual Evans syndrome incidence and prevalence rose significantly during the study period, to 1.8 per million person-years and 21.3 per million persons, respectively, in 2016. The median survival with Evans syndrome was 7.2 years (primary Evans syndrome: 10.9 years; secondary Evans syndrome: 1.7 years). Secondary Evans syndrome was associated with higher mortality rates than any of the other cohorts, with a 5-year survival of 38%. Among patients with Evans syndrome, the prevailing causes of death were bleeding, infections, and hematological cancer. In conclusion, we found that both primary and secondary Evans syndrome conferred a poor prognosis. Lethal complications probably derive primarily from manifestations of underlying autoimmune hemolytic anemia and immune thrombocytopenia. Our findings suggested that suspicion of Evans syndrome should prompt vigilant clinical follow-up. International collaborations are warranted to advance our knowledge of optimal management of this rare disease.

### Spontaneous fatal intracranial hemorrhage in a child with Evans syndrome [^5402a09e]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

Evans syndrome is a chronic and recurrent disease often resistant to multiagent therapy. Spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage is a rare but life-threatening complication in children with Evans syndrome. The authors report the fatal course of a child with chronic thrombocytopenia who presented a spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage. The case indicates that this potentially fatal event may occur even in children with a moderate grade of chronic thrombocytopenia. Early recognition and aggressive management is required for an adequate management of this rare complication.

### Guidelines on the management of drug-induced immune and secondary autoimmune, haemolytic anaemia [^a1c3c613]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for autoimmune hemolytic anemia, more specifically with respect to splenectomy, indications, BSH 2017 guidelines recommend to offer splenectomy as second-line therapy in patients with primary Evans syndrome.

### Bortezomib treatment of steroid-refractory Evans syndrome in children [^e73897be]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatment of refractory Evans syndrome (ES) remains a challenge in hematology practice. Due to rarity of this condition, evidence-based approaches are limited and often treatment choices stem from small case series or anecdotal experiences. There is mounting evidence that some patients have genetic defects that could be targeted with promising preliminary results. Here, we describe three very refractory pediatric ES cases treated on bortezomib without adverse effects. Two of the three patients had dramatic and long-lasting recovery that started following the initial doses of the drug. Clinical trials to assess the role of bortezomib in ES treatment are warranted.

### Evans syndrome in adults: an observational multicenter study [^f9b7d6d2]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Evans syndrome (ES) is a rare condition characterized by the association of multiple autoimmune cytopenias (AICs), usually autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and rarely autoimmune neutropenia (AIN). In 1951, Evans et aldescribed the presence of thrombocytopenia in patients with AIHA as well as the occurrence of red blood cell sensitization with or without overt hemolysis in patients with ITP. They proposed a spectrum-like relationship between the 2 diseases, likely resulting from autoantibodies, the production of which could be decreased by splenectomy. Since then, the syndrome has been further characterized, with an estimated incidence of 1 to 9 cases per million people per year, with up to 50% of ES cases being secondary to a variety of conditions, including infections, primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs; particularly in children), systemic autoimmune diseases (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis), lymphoproliferative syndromes, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Recent prospective studies highlighted the clinical features, including disease associations and outcomes, in pediatrics; however, less is known about adult patients, with the largest series of 68 cases dating back to 2008. In this collaborative international study, we retrospectively analyzed 116 patients with ES focusing on baseline characteristics, treatment requirements, occurrence of complications, and death. We show that ES in adults is marked by many relapses, severe complications, and high mortality, related to the severity of anemia at presentation and thrombotic and infectious complications.

### Primary and secondary immune cytopenias: evaluation and treatment approach in children [^e9c3d944]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

This review summarizes the evaluation and management of the autoimmune cytopenias, a heterogeneous group of conditions including, but not limited to, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, immune thrombocytopenia, and multilineage disorders in Evans syndrome. These diseases can be challenging to treat and there are limited data comparing second-line therapeutics. The understanding of the molecular cause of these conditions is improving with the goal of advancing therapies and making them more targeted.

### Long term follow-up of pediatric-onset Evans syndrome: broad immunopathological manifestations and high treatment burden [^87cea0a4]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, pES must now be considered a complex multi-systemic disease in which cytopenias frequently present fewer challenges than IM and infections in longterm follow-up. Adult patients with pES form a specific subgroup, distinct from older adults with ES. Multidisciplinary follow-up of patients with pES is needed and must focus on IM screening, genetic diagnosis, infections prevention, patient-tailored drugs development, and AYA management. Specifically, the infection burden may be reduced by ensuring up-to-date vaccinations, eradicating chronic infections, and using adequate antimicrobial prophylaxis or immunoglobulin replacements. As in several chronic pediatric diseases, dedicated child-to-adult transition programs are warranted to improve outcomes in patients with pES.

### What is in a name: defining pediatric refractory ITP [^f66faf1f]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

A general definition of refractory is an unmanageable state, resistant to treatment or cure. Refractory malignancies and refractory infections imply high-risk disease with a poor clinical prognosis. The definition of refractory within ITP has never been agreed upon and the term is often used in challenging cases that may still be naïve to certain therapies and require more extensive diagnostic evaluation. A working group of pediatric hematologists was tasked with determining terminology to classify challenging cases of ITP.

Pediatric hematologists from the United States, Canada, Mexico, and France discussed the framework necessary to accurately define a child with symptomatic ITP who is challenging to treat. Although the group was initially divided on the continued use of the term refractory in pediatric ITP, it was clear that this term and a single definition could be more readily applied to the setting of emergent therapy compared with disease-modifying therapy. With 100% agreement, the faculty established that "refractory to emergent therapy" could be defined as no platelet response after treatment with all eligible emergent pharmacotherapies.

What does this definition of refractory to emergent therapy achieve? It defines a subset of pediatric ITP cases of acutely symptomatic ITP that have failed first-line standard-of-care intervention and may have a higher risk of ongoing disease burden. These complicated cases require immediate identification to rapidly escalate use of disease-modifying therapies (eg, rituximab, thrombopoietin-receptor agonists, and immunomodulating agents), to expand evaluation for secondary immune-mediated thrombocytopenias, which may be more severe and less responsive to standard ITP therapy (eg, Evans syndrome) or other causes of thrombocytopenia that require a different mechanism of treatment (eg, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or hemolytic uremic syndrome), and to define a group of children who should be offered participation in clinical trials to identify optimal/novel therapies and understand the biology of their disease.

### Management of Evans syndrome [^e1bf8153]. British Journal of Haematology (2006). Low credibility.

Evans syndrome is an uncommon condition defined by the combination (either simultaneously or sequentially) of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) with a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) in the absence of known underlying aetiology. This condition generally runs a chronic course and is characterised by frequent exacerbations and remissions. First-line therapy is usually corticosteroids and/or intravenous immunoglobulin, to which most patients respond; however, relapse is frequent. Options for second-line therapy include immunosuppressive drugs, especially ciclosporin or mycophenolate mofetil; vincristine; danazol or a combination of these agents. More recently a small number of patients have been treated with rituximab, which induces remission in the majority although such responses are often sustained for < 12 months and the long-term effects in children are unclear. Splenectomy may also be considered although long-term remissions are less frequent than in uncomplicated ITP. For very severe and refractory cases stem cell transplantation (SCT) offers the only chance of long-term cure. The limited data available suggest that allogeneic SCT may be superior to autologous SCT but both carry risks of severe morbidity and of transplant-related mortality. Cure following reduced-intensity conditioning has now been reported and should be considered for younger patients in the context of controlled clinical trials.

### Primary Evans syndrome in an adult man [^aed99349]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Evans syndrome (ES) is a simultaneous or subsequent development of two haematological disorders, autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) and immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). It can be primary (idiopathic) or secondary (associated with an underlying disease). Primary Evans is a diagnosis of exclusion and has a poorer prognosis than AIHA or ITP alone. We present a 55-year-old man who presented with weakness and lethargy and was diagnosed to be suffering from primary ES.

### Adult Evans' syndrome [^3329c8e9]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Evans syndrome (ES) is a rare immune disorder defined as the simultaneous or sequential occurrence in a single patient of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA) ± autoimmune neutropenia (AIN). ES represents approximately 5% to 10% of all wAIHA and 2%-5% of all ITP cases in adults and its mortality rate is high. When ITP and wAIHA occurred concomitantly, other differential diagnoses must be ruled out. ES can be primary or secondary and isolated or associated with another underlying disorder and secondary ES. The management of ES is mostly empirical with a low level of evidence. This review reports some new insights on this rare disease and provides some practical tools for the diagnosis and management of adult ES.

### Evaluating the prevalence of inborn errors of immunity in adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenia or Evans syndrome [^c008dbcb]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The inborn errors of immunity (IEIs) are a heterogenous group of genetic disorders characterized by immune deficiency and dysregulation, which lead to increased risk of infection, autoimmunity, and malignancy. The advent of comprehensive and affordable next-generation sequencing (NGS) has led to a rapid rise in the diagnosis and identification of IEIs, now numbering > 450 monogenic defects.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a common manifestation of IEIs and can be the first presenting symptom of an underlying IEI in adults and children. Approximately 20% of patients with pediatric chronic ITP and 40% of patients with pediatric Evans syndrome (a combination of ITP and autoimmune hemolytic anemia) harbor an underlying IEI. In adults with immune cytopenias, the prevalence of underlying IEIs has not been defined, and IEIs may go unrecognized in these patients because of broad phenotypic heterogeneity and a lack of provider familiarity.

Patients with autoimmune cytopenias are recommended to undergo quantitative immunoglobulin testing to assess the risk of immunosuppression. Formal diagnosis of an IEI may have additional utility as IEI-related autoimmune cytopenias are less responsive to standard therapies and often associate with other immunopathologic manifestations, such as immune-mediated gastrointestinal disease in children. Molecular diagnosis may also guide treatment given the mounting success of targeted therapies, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for select patients with challenging IEI-associated sequelae, including refractory ITP.

The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of IEIs among a real-world cohort of adult patients from the United States with persistent or chronic ITP or Evans syndrome by applying an NGS panel encompassing > 370 genes implicated in IEIs.

### Evans syndrome in adults: an observational multicenter study [^2faeac90]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

Evans syndrome (ES) is a rare condition, defined as the presence of 2 autoimmune cytopenias, most frequently autoimmune hemolytic anemia and immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and rarely autoimmune neutropenia. ES can be classified as primary or secondary to various conditions, including lymphoproliferative disorders, other systemic autoimmune diseases, and primary immunodeficiencies, particularly in children. In adult ES, little is known about clinical features, disease associations, and outcomes. In this retrospective international study, we analyzed 116 adult patients followed at 13 European tertiary centers, focusing on treatment requirements, occurrence of complications, and death. ES was secondary to or associated with underlying conditions in 24 cases (21%), mainly other autoimmune diseases and hematologic neoplasms. Bleeding occurred in 42% of patients, mainly low grade and at ITP onset. Almost all patients received first-line treatment (steroids with or without intravenous immunoglobulin), and 23% needed early additional therapy for primary refractoriness. Additional therapy lines included rituximab, splenectomy, immunosuppressants, thrombopoietin receptor agonists, and others, with response rates > 80%. However, a remarkable number of relapses occurred, requiring ≥ 3 therapy lines in 54% of cases. Infections and thrombotic complications occurred in 33% and 21% of patients, respectively, mainly grade ≥ 3, and correlated with the number of therapy lines. In addition to age, other factors negatively affecting survival were severe anemia at onset and occurrence of relapse, infection, and thrombosis. These data show that adult ES is often severe and marked by a relapsing clinical course and potentially fatal complications, pinpointing the need for high clinical awareness, prompt therapy, and anti-infectious/anti-thrombotic prophylaxis.

### Multimodal management, including precisely targeted irradiation, in a severe refractory case of Evans syndrome [^040b3218]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

A challenging case of acute autoimmune thrombocytopenia (ITP) which evolved into a chronic refractory case of Evans syndrome over a period of more than 23 years is presented and may illustrate current therapeutic dilemmas now perplexing patients and clinicians. Newer modalities are being developed and their eventual role in the scheme of clinical management remains to be established. While this development unfolds, highly targeted radiotherapy was applied in this case to reduce platelet uptake by a refractory recurrent splenule with the goal of stabilizing the platelet count until promising investigational thrombopoietic agents or other newer, less toxic therapies might become available for wider application.

### Allogeneic stem cell transplantation for Evans syndrome [^33910d89]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2001). Low credibility.

Evans syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by combined autoimmune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). Standard treatments consist of transfusions, corticosteroids, splenectomy, IVIG, anabolic steroids, vincristine, alkylating agents, or cyclosporine. In a patient with refractory disease, an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) resulted in complete clinical and serologic remission for more than 30 months. Allogeneic HSCT may be the only current curative therapy for Evans syndrome but may also be complicated by significant toxicities.

Key Points

- Autoimmune cytopenias are a common manifestation of IEIs.
- Although IEIs often underlie pediatric Evans syndrome, no cases of IEI were identified in this real-world study of adults with ITP and Evans syndrome.

### Pulmonary hypertension in children with Evans syndrome [^0d828071]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Evans syndrome is a rare cause of hemolysis in pediatric patients. The authors describe two severely affected patients who had previously been heavily treated, and who subsequently developed severe pulmonary hypertension. Both patients were successfully managed by a combination of immunosuppression and anti-pulmonary hypertension treatment. The first patient to present, case A, received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant with subsequent cure of both Evans syndrome and pulmonary hypertension and is now on a weaning dose of sildenafil. Case B is being worked up for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. The authors speculate that the pulmonary hypertension was caused by the underlying immune dysregulation and hemolysis and that Evans syndrome joins the list of other hemolytic anemias that cause pulmonary hypertension, such as sickle cell disease, thalassemia, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. However, they suggest a vasculitic process as the main cause.

### Evaluating the prevalence of inborn errors of immunity in adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenia or Evans syndrome [^8ba2107c]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Despite estimates that IEIs commonly underlie pediatric ITP and Evans syndrome, no cases were identified by an NGS panel, encompassing > 370 genes implicated in IEI in this real-world, single-center cohort of adult patients with persistent or chronic ITP. Although the prevalence was anticipated to be lower than in a pediatric population, the negative finding was surprising as the study cohort was unintentionally enriched for characteristics likely to be associated with an underlying IEI, including a high proportion of patients with heavily pretreated and longstanding ITP on par with contemporary interventional trials, personal and family history of autoimmunity, and early onset of disease, including 9 (20.5%) who presented in childhood, 2 of whom had pediatric Evans syndrome. Nearly one-third of the study population had ITP secondary to a systemic autoimmune disease, compared with a rate of ∼10% in population-based studies of adult ITP.

### Targeted ITP strategies: do they elucidate the biology of ITP and related disorders? [^5794561c]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

An elusive goal in hematology is a detailed understanding of autoimmune blood disorders including idiopathic (immune) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), and Evans Syndrome. While it is clear that these disorders have an autoimmune pathophysiology, the exact mechanisms are not clear. Agents that target the immune system specifically, such as rituximab and tacrolimus, are currently being used clinically with favorable results. Targeted therapy may be useful not only in treating these difficult diseases, but also may provide clues to the underlying disease pathophysiology. Carefully designed studies using targeted therapy may provide biologic predictors of disease severity, as well as predictors of response to therapy.

### Ophthalmic manifestations as first presenting sign of Evans syndrome [^2c68c1ba]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This work reports a case of Evans syndrome first presenting with ophthalmic signs.

Methods

A 27-year-old previously healthy man presented with headaches and bilateral blurred vision for 2 weeks. The visual acuity was 20/30–1 and 20/60–2 in the right eye and left eye, respectively. A fundus examination revealed Roth spots, diffuse multilayer retinal hemorrhages in the macula and periphery, and tortuous vessels in both eyes. Optical coherence tomography showed a disrupted foveal contour from intraretinal fluid and hemorrhage in both eyes. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated dilated and tortuous vessels with scattered blocking defects from hemorrhages.

Results

A workup revealed warm hemolytic anemia with severe thrombocytopenia consistent with the diagnosis of Evans syndrome.

Conclusions

Evans syndrome is a rare blood dyscrasia that can first present as subacute vision loss and should be added to the differential of diffuse bilateral retinal hemorrhages spanning a multitude of retinal layers.

### Evans syndrome in a young man with rare autoimmune associations and transplanted liver [^76e8bb32]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Evans syndrome is classically characterised by two or more cytopenias occurring either concomitantly or sequentially. Most commonly, these are autoimmune haemolytic anaemia and immune thrombocytopenia purpura. It is mostly associated with specific autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus and lymphoproliferative disorders. We present a case report of Evans syndrome in a young man with primary sclerosing cholangitis and Crohn's disease, neither of which are classically associated with the condition. The case also further adds to the number of case reports of Evans syndrome occurring in patients following liver transplantation.

### A case of Evans' syndrome following influenza vaccine [^c7696b03]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Evans' syndrome is an uncommon condition defined by the combination (either simultaneously or sequentially) of immune thrombocytopenia purpura and autoimmune hemolytic anemia with a positive direct antiglobulin test in the absence of known underlying etiology.

Objectives

We present a case of Evans' syndrome following influenza vaccination.

Case Report

A 50-year-old man with no prior medical history developed Evans' syndrome 4 days after receiving influenza immunization. The patient improved following treatment with oral prednisone and intravenous immunoglobulin.

Conclusion

Influenza vaccine is one of the most commonly used vaccines worldwide, with millions of people being vaccinated annually. Despite its wide use, only sparse information has been published concerning any hematological effects of this vaccine. The rarity of such effects supports the safety of using this vaccine.

### Thrombopoietin receptor agonists in adult Evans syndrome: an international multicenter experience [^f26c15e3]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

TO THE EDITOR:

Evans syndrome (ES) is a rare condition, defined as the presence of 2 autoimmune cytopenias: more frequently, autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and, rarely, autoimmune neutropenia (AIN).ES can be classified as primary or secondary to various conditions, including lymphoproliferative disease, primary immune deficiencies, or other systemic autoimmune diseases. The onset of ES may be acute and life threatening, whereas its clinical course is usually chronic and marked by several relapses of AIHA, ITP, or both. In addition, risks of thrombosis and infections were ∼2 times those observed in primary AIHA or ITP in a recent European study. First-line therapy is based on steroids, with or without intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs), followed by a second-line treatment largely depending on the cytopenia, and include rituximab, splenectomy, and cytotoxic immunosuppressants. Since their arrival, thrombopoietin receptors agonists (TPO-RAs), such as romiplostim and eltrombopag, have been increasingly used in primary ITP with high efficacy, and a good safety profile. However, their use in ES has never been systematically studied, and only a few case reports are available for this challenging population. In this observational study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of TPO-RAs in a multicentric cohort of patients with ES.

### Long term follow-up of pediatric-onset Evans syndrome: broad immunopathological manifestations and high treatment burden [^62af1d25]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The presence of both immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) defines Evans syndrome (ES). Pediatric-onset ES (pES) is a rare disease, and approximately ten new cases are diagnosed every year in France, which has a population of 66 million. Since its first description in 1951 by Robert Evans, our understanding of pES has been based on small retrospective cohorts with limited follow-up. In 2004, the French Rare Disease Center CEREVANCE set up the prospective national cohort OBS'CEREVANCE, which includes children with AIHA, chronic ITP persisting for more than 12 months (cITP), and pES.

Preliminary reports from this cohort and previously published studies showed that pES is a chronic disease with a high rate of relapse for both types of cytopenias. Mortality rates across studies have ranged from 7–36%. In addition to cytopenias, immunopathological manifestations (IM) such as autoimmune/autoinflammatory organ diseases, lymphoproliferation, and hypogammaglobulinemia have been reported in 70–80% of patients with pES. In an undetermined number of cases, pES is thought to be "secondary" and caused by an underlying disease, classically systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS). Recently, genetic analyses found a heterogeneous genetic background in up to 65% of a subset of 80 patients from the OBS'CEREVANCE cohort. These patients carried variants in genes that are linked to primary immunodeficiencies (PID) or involved in immune responses.

Overall, outcomes and the long-term course of pES are poorly understood. There have been no comprehensive longitudinal studies including both cytopenia and IM. In addition, the transition to adulthood is often particularly challenging for patients with chronic pediatric diseases. Adolescents–young adults (AYA) outcomes have not been investigated in patients with pES, and whether the disease improves with age is unknown. In a clinical setting, the possibility to identify high-risk patients would be extremely helpful in the management of this complex disease. Here, we describe the long-term course of hematological IM and treatments received throughout childhood into adulthood in patients with pES from the OBS'CEREVANCE cohort. We aimed to identify clinically relevant factors associated to the occurrence of IM, the number of second-line treatments received and mortality. Particularly, we investigated the impact of the number second-line treatment received and splenectomy on mortality.

### Evans syndrome in a young man with rare autoimmune associations and transplanted liver [^3d942867]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Learning points

This is a classic case of Evans syndrome with sequential occurrence of cytopenias in a young patient. However, it is notable as he has multiple autoimmune conditions that may have predisposed to it but are not commonly associated with it.
This case report adds to the increasing number of reports centred around Evans syndrome occurring in patients following solid-organ transplant.
Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) in inflammatory bowel disease is associated most with ulcerative colitis; however, we present evidence that suggests it can be associated with Crohn's disease and PSC and that the combination of both may confer increased risk for AIHA.

### Sustained remission of CIDP associated with Evans syndrome [^5070fb46]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

A patient with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) developed Evans syndrome (hemolytic anemia/thrombocytopenia) 17 months after onset of symptoms despite different immunomodulatory treatments. A therapeutic approach with the chimeric monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody rituximab induced substantial improvement of CIDP and hematologic recovery. The patient remains in sustained remission 17 months after completion of therapy. Rituximab may represent a successful therapy in otherwise refractory CIDP.

Use of rituximab in children

Following the development of rituximab for adults with ITP, studies soon migrated to pediatric patients (Table 4).

Table 4.
Rituximab in children.

The first large series was reported in 2005 and included 24 chronic ITP patients who were refractory to or relapsed after previous treatments. The ORR to "standard-dose" rituximab was 78%, with a 63% CR rate and an overall sustained response rate of 37%.

The first prospective phase I/II study of rituximab in children and adolescents with chronic ITP included 36 patients with severe refractory ITP or Evans syndrome treated with "standard-dose" rituximab. After a follow up of 1 year, 31% of them maintained a platelet count > 50×10⁹/L.

A systematic review including 14 studies with a total of 323 pediatric ITP patients reported a pooled response rate of 68%, and a pooled CR rate of 39%, with a median duration of response of 12.8 months.

"Low-dose" rituximab has also been tested in children with ITP: Taube et al. explored the efficacy of a single dose of rituximab (375 mg/m²) in 22 patients with chronic ITP; the ORR was 59%, with a 27% CR rate, and 36% of patients maintained a long-term remission (median duration of remission 13.5 months; range 2–16 months).

Oved et al. explored the addition of three 4-day cycles of dexamethasone (28 mg/m²) to "standard-dose" rituximab in 33 children with persistent/chronic ITP. The ORR was close to 50%, and 62% of the responders maintained the remission for a median of 35.5 months.

Factors predictive of response were also sought in children. Bennett et al.found a weak association between response and Evans syndrome, female sex and black race. Parodi and colleagues performed a retrospective study including 49 children (77% with chronic ITP) treated with "standard-dose" rituximab (ORR 69%, 60% relapse-free survival at 36 months), and found a significantly higher probability of relapse-free survival in males aged > 14 years and females aged > 12 years (88.9% vs. 56.7%), in patients who achieved a CR (70.2% vs. 25%) and in patients who achieved the response within 20 days of treatment (73.7% vs. 22%).

### Long term follow-up of pediatric-onset Evans syndrome: broad immunopathological manifestations and high treatment burden [^69b037a5]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Pediatric-onset Evans syndrome (pES) is defined by both immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) before the age of 18 years. There have been no comprehensive long-term studies of this rare disease, which can be associated to various immunopathological manifestations (IM). We report outcomes of the 151 patients with pES and more than 5 years of follow-up from the nationwide French prospective OBS'CEREVANCE cohort. Median age at final follow-up was 18.5 years (range, 6.8–50.0 years) and the median follow-up period was 11.3 years (range, 5.1–38.0 years). At 10 years, ITP and AIHA were in sustained complete remission in 54.5% and 78.4% of patients, respectively. The frequency and number of clinical and biological IM increased with age: at the age of 20 years, 74% had at least one clinical IM (cIM). A wide range of cIM occurred, mainly lymphoproliferation, dermatological, gastrointestinal/hepatic and pneumological IM. The number of cIM was associated with a subsequent increase in the number of second-line treatments received (other than steroids and immunoglobulins; hazard ratio 1.4, 95% Confidence Interval: 1.15–1.60, P = 0.0002, Cox proportional hazards method). Survival at 15 years after diagnosis was 84%. Death occurred at a median age of 18 years (range, 1.7–31.5 years), and the most frequent cause was infection. The number of second-line treatments and severe/recurrent infections were independently associated with mortality. In conclusion, long-term outcomes of pES showed remission of cytopenias but frequent IM linked to high second-line treatment burden. Mortality was associated to drugs and/or underlying immunodeficiencies, and adolescents-young adults are a high-risk subgroup.

### Evans syndrome in a young man with rare autoimmune associations and transplanted liver [^9734e88c]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Background

Evans syndrome is a rare autoimmune condition that is characterised by the presence of two or more cytopenias, most commonly warm autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) and immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP), and rarely immune neutropenia. These conditions may occur simultaneously or sequentially. The condition is thought to have a prevalence of 1–9 per million people per year, with up to 50% of cases occurring secondary to an underlying disease process such as infection, primary immunodeficiencies, autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus, haematopoietic stem cell transplants and lymphoproliferative disorders. Evans syndrome is thought to be more difficult to treat than immune cytopenias in isolation, and a recent multicentre observational and retrospective study has shown it to be highly relapsing and commonly marked by severe complications. In this case, we present a case of Evans syndrome in a young male patient who was the recipient of a liver transplant due to primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) with a recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease.

### Evans syndrome in a patient with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome: a case report [^062c78a6]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

One patient with a chromosome 22q11.2 deletion and Evans syndrome is reported in this paper. Microdeletions of 22q11.2 are the main etiology for DiGeorge syndrome, a disorder characterized by heart defects, immune deficiencies due to aplasia or hypoplasia of the thymus, and hypocalcemia. Evans syndrome refers to a hematological autoimmune disorder with autoimmune hemolytic anemia accompanied by immune thrombocytopenia. A wide range of autoimmune disorders have been described in DiGeorge syndrome and velocardiofacial syndrome, including one prior report of autoimmune hemolytic anemia and immune thrombocytopenia. The patient reported herein strengthens the association between the 22q11.2 deletion spectrum and Evans syndrome.

### The spectrum of Evans syndrome in adults: new insight into the disease based on the analysis of 68 cases [^44ad0a5a]. Blood (2009). Low credibility.

Evans syndrome (ES) is a rare disease characterized by the simultaneous or sequential development of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and/or immune neutropenia. To better describe the characteristics and outcome of ES in adults, a survey was initiated in 2005. The data from 68 patients (60% of them women) fulfilling strict inclusion criteria for ES are reported. The mean age at time of ITP and/or AIHA onset was 52 plus or minus 33 years, both cytopenias occurred simultaneously in 37 cases (54.5%). ES was considered as "primary" in 34 patients (50%) but was associated with an underlying disorder in half of the cases, including mainly systemic lupus, lymphoproliferative disorders, and common variable immunodeficiency. All patients were given corticosteroids, but 50 of them (73%) required at least one "second-line" treatment, including splenectomy(n = 19) and rituximab (n = 11). At time of analysis, after a mean follow-up of 4.8 years, only 22 patients (32%) were in remission off treatment; 16 (24%) had died. In elderly patients, the risk of cardiovascular manifestations related to AIHA seems to be higher than the ITP-related risk of severe bleeding. In conclusion, ES is a potentially life-threatening condition that may be associated with other underlying autoimmune or lymphoproliferative disorders.

### Rituximab for refractory Evans syndrome and other immune-mediated hematologic diseases [^21c030a9]. American Journal of Hematology (2004). Low credibility.

The authors describe a 21-year-old man with long-lasting Evans syndrome refractory to corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents; the patient responded to four weekly infusions of rituximab. The patient relapsed with thrombocytopenia 7 months post-therapy and was successfully re-treated with two weekly doses of the same monoclonal antibody. He remains in remission for 7-plus months after the second treatment. Therapy was well tolerated, and no infectious complications occurred, despite avoiding administration of prophylactic gammaglobulin. Rituximab appears safe and modestly effective in a variety of immune-mediated hematologic diseases, including autoimmune hemolytic anemia, chronic immune thrombocytopenia, Evans syndrome, pure red cell aplasia, mixed type II cryoglobulinemia, cold agglutinin disease, and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. However, as most of the published literature consists of case reports and small case series, international collaboration is essential in order to better define the efficacy and safety of this agent in children and adults with hematologic diseases.

### A pilot study of orelabrutinib treatment in three cases of refractory / relapsed autoimmune haemolytic anaemia / Evans syndrome [^41f76331]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). Medium credibility.

Currently, there is no effective treatment for refractory/relapsed (R/R) autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA), associated with poor quality of life. Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors have begun to be used in some autoimmune diseases. We initiated the clinical trial of orelabrutinib treatment on R/R AIHA/Evans Syndrome, which is in progress. The preliminary results showed that nine of the 12 enrolled patients responded to orelabrutinib treatment. Here, we reported three cases who have completed the treatment and were followed up for 6months, achieving complete or partial remission. Orelabrutinib is expected to become a new second-line treatment for R/R AIHA/Evans syndrome.

### Evans syndrome in adults: an observational multicenter study [^defec655]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Here we describe the largest series of adult patients with ES with granular clinical information ever reported and show that the disease may be very severe, highly relapsing, and marked by several sometimes fatal complications, particularly bleeding, infection, and thrombosis.

Although patients with ES displayed initial high response rates (> 80%) to various therapies, including rituximab, splenectomy, TPO-RAs, and immunosuppressive treatments, comparable if not higher than those in patients with AIHA and ITP separately, one-fourth of patients can be considered primary refractory. In fact, they required additional frontline treatments beyond steroids with or without IVIGs and showed increased risk of complications and worse outcomes, thus representing a true unmet need. Furthermore, a remarkably high relapse rate was observed in the whole cohort, with 70% of cases requiring ≥ 2 lines of therapy. In fact, response duration to main second-line treatments (rituximab and splenectomy) was inferior to DORs in AIHA and ITP separately. Interestingly, the early use of IVIGs in combination with steroids was associated with a lower risk of early relapse, although this potentially protective effect will require prospective confirmation. The several courses of steroids at each relapse underline that we still rely on this drug to induce a quick response in the acute phase, because other treatments (ie, immunosuppressive therapy, rituximab, and novel molecules) take time to work. This happens at the price of several adverse effects that warrant appropriate monitoring. Finally, the association between low IgM levels and higher risk of relapse after first treatment may be linked to a deeper underlying immune dysregulation in chronic/relapsing disease, as observed in ES secondary to PIDs or lymphoproliferative syndromes (often marked by hypogammaglobulinemia).

### Evans syndrome in adults: an observational multicenter study [^ef033cd4]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

Concerning survival, the severity of anemia at diagnosis was the main predictor of mortality, similar to what has been reported in primary AIHA, where each gram of Hb reduction yielded a 7% greater risk of relapse. Regarding time-dependent variables, complications were the main risk factors for a fatal outcome in our series, in line with a recent Danish epidemiologic study. The latter reported that bleeding and infections were the main causes of death, resulting in a median OS of only 7.2 years. Moreover, all-cause mortality was higher in patients with ES than in the general population, and the proportion of deaths resulting from bleeding was greater in ES than in isolated ITP. Our results strengthen the evidence of the dismal impact of complications on survival. In fact, the occurrence of at least 1 of either relapse, infection, or thrombosis increased the risk of death by sixfold, and the presence of 2 increased the risk by > 20-fold, regardless of age. On the whole, mortality was comparable to that of low-grade hematologic malignancies, such as low-risk myelodysplastic syndromes and indolent lymphomas, despite the markedly younger median age of patients with ES.

Our study has several limitations, particularly regarding the retrospective nature of the analysis, the heterogeneous workup (genetic testing included various methods and panels), and the lack of uniformity in multi-institutional management. Other possible confounders include difficulties in analyzing each ES relapse and evaluating the treatments used for each cytopenia. However, the impact of relapses and ES complications on outcomes clearly emerged from the analysis and supports some important clinical warnings. An international prospective registry for adult ES would allow the collection of clearer data on disease course, treatment, and complications, because forms of adult ES are often excluded from clinical trials for ITP and AIHA, and therefore, a specific approach is lacking. In conclusion, adult ES is a rare and often severe disease requiring high clinical awareness, accurate diagnosis to assess secondary forms, and prompt treatment. Therapeutic strategies should take into account the risk of infection, thrombosis, and relapse. Supportive care including prophylactic measures for infectious and thrombotic complications is warranted.

### Evans syndrome in a young man with rare autoimmune associations and transplanted liver [^9cda9ffc]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Our patient was not diagnosed with conditions most typically associated with the development of Evans syndrome; however, he had an extensive autoimmune history having developed PSC, Crohn's disease and ITP independently at various points in his life. These conditions are not commonly associated with Evans syndrome.

Little is known about Evans syndrome in adult patients with solid-organ transplants. However, a review of the literature has identified multiple case reports of Evans syndrome in paediatric patients following liver transplant. It is therefore possible that Evans syndrome as a complication of solid-organ transplant, and in particular liver transplant, is potentially overlooked in adults.

Furthermore, there is also not a strong association between Evans syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with only a single case study identifying an association between ulcerative colitis and the condition and none found regarding Crohn's disease. Our case may be the first published case of Evans syndrome in an adult with Crohn's disease. Additionally, PSC and concurrent Crohn's disease represent approximately 7%–10% of PSC-IBD patients.

The combination of PSC and Crohn's disease may increase the risk of further autoimmune disease, with 50% of cases in one review having been complicated by autoimmune phenomenon, including AIHA.

It should be stated that isolated AIHA without ITP is frequently associated with IBD. It is more common with ulcerative colitis than Crohn's disease, and it is associated with greater disease severity and the presence of concurrent extraintestinal manifestations. In the two case reports found regarding AIHA and Crohn's disease; both patient's had ileal disease like the patient presented here.

Evans syndrome is considered harder to treat than isolated warm AIHA, with a study of 68 patients finding only 32% in remission at a mean follow-up of 4.8 years. Although a single reported case of a 40-month complete remission of postliver transplant Evans syndrome in a paediatric patient has been reported. In this instance, the patient underwent a splenectomy and cessation of tacrolimus, with tacrolimus thought to underpin the disease presentation.

### Evaluating the prevalence of inborn errors of immunity in adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenia or Evans syndrome [^02127c2f]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Inborn errors of immunity (IEIs) are monogenic disorders that predispose patients to immune dysregulation, autoimmunity, and infection. Autoimmune cytopenias, such as immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and Evans syndrome (a combination of ITP and autoimmune hemolytic anemia), are increasingly recognized phenotypes of IEI. Although recent findings suggest that IEIs may commonly underlie pediatric ITP and Evans syndrome, its prevalence in adult patients with these disorders remains undefined. This study sought to estimate the prevalence of underlying IEIs among adults with persistent or chronic ITP or Evans syndrome using a next-generation sequencing panel encompassing > 370 genes implicated in IEIs. Forty-four subjects were enrolled from an outpatient adult hematology clinic at a tertiary referral center in the United States, with a median age of 49 years (range, 20–83). Fourteen subjects (31.8%) had secondary ITP, including 8 (18.2%) with Evans syndrome. No cases of IEI were identified despite a high representation of subjects with a personal history of autoimmunity (45.5%) and early onset of disease (median age at diagnosis of 40 years [range, 2–77]), including 20.5% who were initially diagnosed as children. Eight subjects (18.2%) were found to be carriers of pathogenic IEI variants, which, in their heterozygous state, are not disease-causing. One case of TUBB1-related congenital thrombocytopenia was identified. Although systematic screening for IEI has been proposed for pediatric patients with Evans syndrome, findings from this real-world study suggest that inclusion of genetic testing for IEI in the routine work-up of adults with ITP and Evans syndrome has a low diagnostic yield.

### Rituximab resistant Evans syndrome and autoimmunity in schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia [^708a076f]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The immune system has evolved to clear pathogens efficiently and to tolerate self. The establishment and maintenance of self-tolerance is a requirement of adaptive immunity. To accomplish this, central tolerance removes self-reactive T cells during thymic development and peripheral tolerance represses self-reactive T cells that escape central tolerance checkpoints. Breakdown of either central or peripheral tolerance can lead to autoimmunity.

One such autoimmune disease is Evans syndrome (ES), which was first described in 1951. ES is defined by a combination (either simultaneously or sequentially) of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) in the absence of an identifiable underlying pathology; ES can also include immune neutropenia. Pediatric ES generally has a chronic course of frequent exacerbations and remissions and a mortality of 7–36%. Most patients respond to corticosteroids and/or intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), but relapse is frequent. Second-line therapies therefore include splenectomy or immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporine A (CsA), mycophenolate mophetil. Recently, consistent with the hypothesis that ES arises from dysregulation of B cells, the monoclonal antibody against the B-cell antigen CD20, rituximab, has shown much promise for treatment of ES.

The patients who died had received more second-line treatments than the others in the cohort (median 3 vs. 2; P = 0.02), including splenectomy, which was more common in this subgroup (56% vs. 20%; P = 0.003). Patients who had received more than two second-line treatments had a three-fold increase in the risk of death compared to those who had received two or less (11 of 65 [16.9%] vs. five of 86 [5.8%], P = 0.03). At death, 81% of patients were receiving ongoing second-line treatment. The number of second-line treatments (HR 1.3; 95% CI: 1.1–1.6; P = 0.004) and severe/recurrent infections (HR 3.4; 95% CI: 1.2–9.7; P = 0.02) were independently associated with a higher risk of mortality after 5 years of follow-up.

### Evans syndrome at childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus diagnosis: a large multicenter study [^737bf768]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Evans syndrome (ES) in childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (cSLE) patients has been rarely reported and limited to small populations.

Procedures

A retrospective multicenter cohort study (Brazilian cSLE group) was performed in 10 Pediatric Rheumatology services including 850 patients with cSLE. ES was assessed at disease diagnosis and defined by the combination of immune thrombocytopenia and autoimmune hemolytic anemia.

Results

ES was observed in 11 of 850 (1.3%) cSLE patients. The majority of them had hemorrhagic manifestations (91%) and active disease (82%). All patients with ES were hospitalized and none died. Comparisons of cSLE patients with and without ES at diagnosis revealed similar frequencies of female gender, multiorgan involvement, autoantibodies profile, and low complement (P > 0.05). Patients with ES had a lower frequency of malar rash (9% vs. 53%, P = 0.003) and musculoskeletal involvement (18% vs. 69%, P = 0.001) than those without this complication. The frequencies of intravenous methylprednisolone (82% vs. 43%, P = 0.013) and intravenous immunoglobulin use (64% vs. 3%, P < 0.0001) were significantly higher in the ES group, with similar current prednisone dose between groups (1.1 [0.76–1.5] vs. 1.0 mg/kg/day [0–30], P = 0.195).

Conclusions

Our large multicenter study identified ES as a rare and severe initial manifestation of active cSLE with good outcome. Diagnosis is challenging due to the lack of typical signs and symptoms of lupus and the requirement to exclude infection and primary immunodeficiency.

### Auto-immune lymphoproliferative disorder and other secondary immune thrombocytopenias in childhood [^37dbec19]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in childhood, typically presents as an acute self-limiting illness. However, secondary ITP is often a chronic disorder due to an underlying disease. Combined cytopenias in childhood, that is, secondary ITP occurring with auto-immune hemolytic anemia and/or auto-immune neutropenia, are often associated with disorders characterized by immune dysregulation. Such disorders include systemic lupus erythematosus, auto-immune lymphoproliferative syndrome, and common variable immune deficiency. Evans syndrome describes the combination of ITP, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and/or autoimmune neutropenia. However, it is now clear that some patients with Evans syndrome have an underlying immunodeficiency. This report focuses on combined auto-immune cytopenias and highlights the challenges in their diagnosis and management.

### Successful treatment of a patient with mixed warm and cold antibody mediated Evans syndrome and glucose intolerance [^27187a3c]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia and autoimmune hemolytic anemia (Evans syndrome) with the presence of both warm and cold autoantibodies (mixed type) are rare in the pediatric age group. This condition may be associated with other autoimmune disorders and is notoriously difficult to treat. This case describes an adolescent male who presented with rapid onset Evans syndrome and diabetes. After failing to respond to high dose prednisone and intravenous immunoglobulin, the patient was successfully treated with monoclonal antibody against CD20 (anti-CD20). This suggests that anti-CD20 is a valuable treatment for severe warm and cold antibody mediated Evans syndrome, and possibly for select cases of antibody mediated diabetes.

### Dermatomyositis associated with generalized subcutaneous edema and Evans syndrome [^23f6c7be]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Although periorbital edema is a common manifestation of dermatomyositis (DM), generalized subcutaneous edema associated with DM is extremely rare. Evans syndrome is an autoimmune disease in which an individual's antibodies attack one's own red blood cells and platelets. Evans syndrome is rarely a presenting feature of DM. DM has been rarely reported to be associated with either generalized edema or Evans syndrome. We report the case of a 52-year-old Korean woman who presented with generalized subcutaneous edema, an erythematous rash, dysphagia, and proximal muscle weakness, and subsequently developed features of Evans syndrome. Treatment with high-dose glucocorticoids and an immunosuppressive agent controlled the DM, the generalized subcutaneous edema, and the Evans syndrome.

What if the patient is persistently anemic despite iron supplementation?

If the mean corpuscular volume is low, consider workup for underlying thalassemia trait or iron deficiency with the latter being common in the setting of heavy menses. Iron replacement is not always straightforward; using oral replacement every other day may be equally effective as daily administration. Resorting to IV iron may be important especially if oral replacement does not correct iron status and/or there are signs of a chronic inflammatory disease. If the mean corpuscular volume is high, bone marrow failure must be considered. There could also be pernicious anemia secondary to vitamin B12 deficiency or an autoimmune hemolytic anemia, such as Evans syndrome. Another possibility is microangiopathic anemia with thrombocytopenia, whether in the form of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or hemolytic uremic syndrome. In these cases, there would likely be increased reticulocytosis. While individually each of these conditions is rare, having one of many rare conditions would not be as surprising.

If heavy menstrual bleeding persists, a progesterone-based approach is superior to an estrogen-based approach in women with ITP as the former raises the platelet count. While estrogen-based therapies are more commonly used in general practice for heavy menstrual bleeding, they might worsen ITP. In contrast, progestational agents have previously been tried as treatment in ITP with good effect. Progesterone may be administered orally at a dose of 5–10 mg daily or medroxyprogresterone acetate (Depo-Provera) can be given intramuscularly once every 3 months but the latter may result in intermittent vaginal bleeding.

### Long term follow-up of pediatric-onset Evans syndrome: broad immunopathological manifestations and high treatment burden [^d0f6ee0c]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This large follow-up study of pES patients included more than 1,900 patient-years. Over the long term, AIHA and ITP were sustainably controlled in the majority of patients. Conversely, clinical and biological IM increased in frequency and number with increasing patient age, finally affecting almost all adult patients. The number of cIM was associated with a subsequent increase in the number of second-line treatments received. Mortality was high, frequently occurred while cytopenias were in remission, and most deaths concerned AYA. Two characteristics were associated to mortality: severe or recurrent infections and the number of second-line treatments received. Overall, the age-related clinical picture showed similar trends for all patients, shifting from cytopenia to increased IM, a greater treatment burden, and an increased risk of mortality.

In setting up a nationwide cohort, the CEREVANCE group tried to ensure unbiased patient inclusion in this study. Omitting patients with less than 5 years of followup data limited any bias due to short-term follow-up, which probably accounts for many of the discrepancies between previous studies. Indeed, our median follow-up period was more than twice as long as in previous studies (median 4.8 years [range, 3–7 years]). However, although the trends reported here are clear, some factors may also influence the estimates. The loss to follow-up mainly concerned AYA and few patients were followed after the age of 20 years. As well, the CEREVANCE group recommends clinical and biological follow-up at least every 6–12 months but local practice or patients' phenotype (such as the presence of cIM) may have influenced biological testing.

### Mycophenolate mofetil for the treatment of children with immune thrombocytopenia and Evans syndrome. A retrospective data review from the Italian association of paediatric haematology / oncology [^1965c92b]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) has been shown to be effective in children with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and Evans syndrome (ES), but data from larger series and details on the timing of the response are lacking. We evaluated 56 children treated with MMF for ITP (n = 40) or ES (n = 16), which was primary or secondary to autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome -related syndrome (ARS). Thirty-five of the 54 evaluable patients (65%) achieved a partial (18%) or complete (46%) response after a median (range) of 20 (7–137) and 37 (7–192) d, respectively. ITP and ES patients responded in 58% and 81% of cases (P = not significant, ns), with complete response in 32% and 81% (P = 0·01), respectively. 60% and 73% of children with primary disease and ARS responded (P = ns) with complete response in 34% and 68% of cases (P = 0·01), respectively. Six of 35 (17%) children relapsed after a median of 283 d (range 189–1036). Limited toxicity was observed in four patients. The median durations of treatment and follow-up were seven and 12·7 months, respectively. This is the largest reported cohort of patients treated with MMF for ITP/ES. The results show that MMF is effective and safe and provides a relatively quick response, suggesting that it has a potential role as an alternative to more aggressive and expensive second/further-line treatments.

### Haematological manifestations of lupus [^b7afd6d2]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical findings and establishing diagnosis

AIHA can be diagnosed in a stepwise manner. First, the anaemia must be established as haemolytic, which can be ascertained by serum biochemistry of haemolytic markers (eg, haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, indirect bilirubin), presence of reticulocytosis and by examination of the peripheral blood smear. Second, using direct antiglobulin test, the clinician should determine whether autoimmunity against red blood cells is triggering haemolysis. Lastly, identification of the type of antibody responsible for haemolysis has to be defined. Warm-acting-AIHA and cold-acting-AIHA are based on the optimal temperature of antigen–antibody reactivity. This multitiered approach should lead to diagnosis or exclusion of the diagnosis of AIHA in patients with SLE.

Patients with AIHA present with constitutional signs and symptoms of anaemia, including fatigue and dyspnoea on exertion. Patients with SLE with AIHA can have other concomitant autoimmune haematological manifestations. For example, patients with SLE can present with AIHA and thrombocytopenia concomitantly or sequentially, which is known as Evans syndrome. Patients with Evans syndrome may have frequent relapses, once glucocorticoids have been tapered or stopped. Hence, when a diagnosis of AIHA in patients with SLE has been established, monitoring for the development of thrombocytopenia is important.

Results

Population

Of the 216 patients with pES, 151 were included in this study (Online Supplementary Figure S1). They were followed from 25 different centers. Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. The median (min–max) follow-up time from the first cytopenia diagnosis was 11.3 years (range, 5.1–38.0 years). Median age at final follow-up was 18.5 years (range, 6.8–50.0 years). In 20 cases (15%), follow-up was discontinued because the patient was considered cured (n = 11) or lost to follow-up (n = 9). Median age at loss to follow-up was 18.4 years (range, 6.8–25.1 years).

### Evans syndrome in adults: an observational multicenter study [^69a7f43a]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

Thrombotic complications, observed in 20% of cases, were fairly more frequent than in AIHA alone, where they have been reported in ∼10% to 15% of cases. Thrombosis was associated with severe hyperhemolytic disease (ie, Hb < 6 g/dL and LDH > 1.5× ULN), but not with previous splenectomy as described for primary AIHA. Thrombotic risk in ES also seems higher than that observed in isolated ITP, where it is only slightly augmented as compared with the general population but increases by threefold if TPO-RAs are administered. In contrast, TPO-RAs were not associated with thrombotic complications in ES, although the limited number of episodes does not allow definite conclusions. The physiopathology of thrombosis in ES likely encompasses the contribution of hemolysis (nitric oxide depletion) and that of procoagulant young platelets released in ITP. Moreover, the risk seems to increase in primary refractory patients, consistent with a highly active and severe disease positive for multiple autoantibodies, particularly LAC. Not surprisingly, thrombotic complications are more frequent during infections, which may fuel the vicious circle of thromboinflammation. These findings suggest the use of anticoagulant prophylaxis may be beneficial in hyperhemolytic patients with ES and infections, provided PLT counts are safe. A comprehensive evaluation of all risk factors is advised, including thrombophilia screening at diagnosis (particularly LAC), because thrombotic episodes have also been observed in thrombocytopenic patients. As expected, bleeding complications are frequent (approximately half of cases), concomitant with ITP, and mainly low grade. However, bleeding may account for early mortality when occurring at disease onset, whereas at relapse, it is generally milder as a result of patient education and medical surveillance.

### Study details | NCT06014775 | Anti-CD38 antibody treating Evans syndrome… [^cadaaaa8]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

Anti-CD38 Antibody Treating Evans Syndrome ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview Evans' syndrome is defined as the concomitant or sequential association of warm auto-immune haemolytic anaemia with immune thrombocytopenia, and less frequently autoimmune neutropenia. ES is a rare situation that represents up to 7% of AIHA and around 2% of ITP. Due to the rarity of the disease, the treatment of ES is mostly extrapolated from what is recommended for isolated auto-immune cytopenia and mostly relies on corticosteroids, rituximab, splenectomy, and supportive therapies. Despite continuous progress in the management of AIC and a gradual increase in ES survival, the mortality due to ES remains higher than the ones of isolated AIC, supporting the need for an improvement in ES management. A branch of pathogenesis for ES has been revealed that plasma cells secrete pathogenic antibodies directed against platelet and red blood cell antigens.

Antiplatelet specific plasma cells have been detected in the spleen of patients with rituximab refractory ITP. In those refractory cases, persistent autoreactive long-lived plasma cells in the bone marrow could explain treatment failure.
- If receiving emergency care for ES, treatment should be stopped > 2 weeks before first dose.
- DAT positive.
- The patient need to be in the state of active hemolysis.
- With normal hepatic and renal functions.
- ECOG performance status ≤ 2.
- **Cardiac function**: New York Heart Association functional class ≤ 2.
- For patients receiving maintenance treatment, corticosteroids must have a stable dose at least 2 weeks before the first administration, TPO receptor agonists and azathioprine, danazol, cyclosporin A, tacrolimus, sirolimus, etc. must be stopped at least 4 weeks before the first administration; The end of anti-CD20 antibody treatment was > 6 months. The end of alkylating agent treatment was > 2 months.

Section I. A young female patient with immune thrombocytopenia: second-line treatment options

The patient's history

A 20-year-old female returns home from college. She notes heavier periods and easy bruising. Her internist sees that she is pale and has visible petechiae on her arms. Complete blood counts show mild anemia (hemoglobin 10.2 g/dL) and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 5×10⁹/L The internist sends her urgently to the emergency room concerned that she might possibly have leukemia. There is no hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy or other abnormal findings on physical examination.

Review of a peripheral blood smear reveals no blasts or abnormalities of other cell lines although her mean corpuscular volume is low (72 fL) and several of her very few platelets are large. She is diagnosed with ITP and given prednisone 1 mg/kg. Over the next few days, she has typical steroid-related side effects: feeling "a little crazy", insomnia and abdominal pain. Her bruises and petechiae disappear, and her period ends. Her hematologist prescribes oral iron supplements and changes her prednisone to dexamethasone 40 mg daily for 4 days. Her steroid-related side effects worsen during the 4 days on dexamethasone 40 mg; however, she soon feels better with no further petechiae, bruising, or menstrual bleeding noted. Her platelet count normalizes to 147×10⁹/L and her hemoglobin improves to 11.2 g/dL. She begins checking her blood counts monthly. The improved complete blood count with a nearly normal mean corpuscular volume excludes bone marrow failure, and also thalassemia trait or microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Similarly, the normal hemoglobin and neutrophil count do not suggest Evans syndrome. Her platelet counts remain in the normal range and her hemoglobin improves to the normal range. At her next visit, her platelet count has decreased to 80×10⁹/L. One month later, her platelet count is 28×10⁹/L with continued normal hemoglobin and infrequent small bruises. With her platelets trending downward, second-line treatment for her ITP is considered.

There is less urgency to consider secondary ITP or a missed diagnosis since she is doing well but at any change of management, it is good practice to re-evaluate. Below we consider some of the " what if " clinical scenarios for this young female.

### Evans syndrome in adults: an observational multicenter study [^21d2e8f5]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients and methods

Patients and diagnosis

In this observational and retrospective multicenter study, we investigated 116 adult patients diagnosed with ES followed at 13 European tertiary centers. ITP, AIHA, and, to a lesser extent, AIN were diagnosed according to current guidelines. If ITP, AIHA, and AIN were not diagnosed concurrently, the diagnosis of the second AIC also required the exclusion of the effects of recent myelosuppressive therapies used for the initial cytopenia. AIHA was classified according to the positivity of the direct antiglobulin test (DAT) as warm (either immunoglobulin G positive [IgG+] or IgG+ plus complement C at low titer), cold (C+), mixed (IgG plus complement+ autoagglutination at room temperature and high-titer cold agglutinins), or yet atypical (DAT−, IgA+). Immunohematologic assessment was performed at ES diagnosis. Anemia severity was categorized according to previous scores for AIHAas moderate (hemoglobin [Hb] 8–10 g/dL), severe (Hb 6–8 g/dL), or very severe (Hb < 6 g/dL). ITP was categorized as severe (platelets [PLTs] < 30×10⁹/L) or moderate (PLTs 30–100×10⁹/L). AIN was classified as severe (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] < 0.5×10⁹/L), moderate (ANC 0.5–1×10⁹/L), or mild (ANC > 1×10⁹/L). The positivity of anti-PLT autoantibodies and anti-neutrophil autoantibodies was registered when available. The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the local ethics committee (Comitato Etico di Milano Area 2).

### Long term follow-up of pediatric-onset Evans syndrome: broad immunopathological manifestations and high treatment burden [^726f5873]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Most patients required second-line treatments. These treatments reflect local practices and we cannot draw conclusions regarding their efficacy. We were unable to investigate the risk associated to specific treatments given the high heterogeneity in second-line treatment combinations and duration as well as the changes in management practices since the cohort onset in 2004. The rapid initial increase in second-line treatments is partly due to the high rate of early relapse and the current practice of administering steroid-sparing agents to treat pES. However, the presence of cytopenia is not the only reason for using these drugs and first- and second-line treatments were also used after CR of both cytopenias. cIM are important in determining the number of second-line treatments used, but bIM may also play a role, particularly in patients with SLE biomarkers, who are frequently given hydroxychloroquine. Nevertheless, second-line treatments are rarely selected based on a single factor. Patients with pES often have bIM and cIM, and the whole clinical picture needs to be assessed before selecting a treatment strategy. As previously reported, approximately one-third of patients may carry alterations in genes that are potentially accessible to targeted therapy. Given the high burden of second-line treatments and their association with infections and mortality, the CEREVANCE network has proposed implementing genetic analyses for all patients with pES to limit the use of immunosuppressive and toxic drugs.

Comprehensively, the pES clinical picture changes as patients age. From 10 to 20 years of age, cytopenia tends to be controlled but IM are more prevalent, and active second- line treatments are used in more than two-thirds of patients during the pediatric-to-adult transition. Overall, as patients age, the illness becomes more severe and the risk of mortality increases. Both IM and treatment burden contribute to the infection-related mortality peak observed at the end of the second decade. The patients who died had received more second-line treatments, including splenectomy. Because these two parameters are correlated (r = 0.60; P < 0.0001), the number of deaths was too low to determine whether splenectomy alone was a risk factor of mortality per se or a marker of severity.

### Rituximab therapy for childhood Evans syndrome [^46795bda]. Haematologica (2007). Low credibility.

The safety and efficacy of rituximab have been retrospectively assessed in 17 children with Evans syndrome. Patients received 4 or 3 weekly doses of rituximab (375 mg/m² per dose) associated with prednisone, alone (14 patients) or associated with other immunosuppressive drugs. Complete or partial remission of at least one cytopenia was achieved in 13 out of the 17 patients (76%), and lasted in 11 of them with a mean follow-up of 2.4 years (range 0.5–7 years). Steroid therapy was stopped or tapered at 50–100% of the baseline dosage in all long-term responders. Moderate side effects and infection occurred only in 4 and 1 children respectively.

### Evans syndrome in adults: an observational multicenter study [^6cdde792]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

Infections and thromboses complicate approximately one-third of cases and mostly occur in the first 2 to 3 years within diagnosis, and their frequency increases along with the number of therapy lines, suggesting an additional iatrogenic effect. However, treatments such as cytotoxic immunosuppressants, TPO-RAs, and splenectomy were not statistically related to the occurrence of complications, possibly indicating that repeated steroid therapy at each relapse may have a prominent role. Additionally, some disease-related risk factors emerged for infections, including presence of secondary ES and splenomegaly, pinpointing the need for anti-infectious prophylaxis in this subset. Moreover, the concomitant onset of ITP and AIHA, the severity of anemia, and the presence of neutropenia with positive antineutrophil autoantibodies emerged as additional risk factors for infectious complications. Altogether, these findings suggest that the extent of the immune dysregulation may be associated with an impairment of immune competence. It is difficult to give recommendations for prophylaxis, except for testing for HBV/HCV status and quantiferon testing for tuberculosis in patients who are candidates for immunosuppression with high-dose steroids, rituximab, or cytotoxic drugs. Vaccinations against capsulated bacteria (meningococcus, Haemophilus, and pneumococcus) are mandatory before splenectomy. Prophylaxis with cotrimoxazole (ie, 800 mg orally every other day) is advisable in patients receiving > 25 mg per day of prednisone (or equivalent) for > 4 weeks, antiviral agents (eg, lamivudine) should be administered to patients at risk for HBV reactivation, along with close surveillance. Chronic HCV infections should be referred for possible eradication before immunosuppression. If tuberculosis is suspected, the infectious disease specialist may indicate specific prophylaxis. Finally, patient education is fundamental, along with prompt referral to medical attention/emergency room in case of severe infection.

### Misdiagnosis of sitosterolemia in a patient as Evans syndrome and familial hypercholesterolemia [^cea669f5]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2021). Medium credibility.

Sitosterolemia is a rare form of dyslipidemia that has diverse clinical manifestations, and insufficient knowledge of the disease frequently leads to a delay in diagnosis. We report a case of sitosterolemia in a 26-year-old Chinese woman, characterized by anemia, thrombocytopenia, persistent hypercholesterolemia, premature atherosclerosis, extensive xanthoma, and arthralgia-tenosynovitis. Successive misdiagnoses of Evans syndrome and familial hypercholesterolemia had been made, and the patient had responded minimally to steroid therapy, splenectomy, and statin treatment; therefore, she was referred to our hospital. On admission, a peripheral blood smear revealed the presence of abnormally shaped erythrocytes and giant platelets. Multiple atherosclerotic lesions, sites of tenosynovitis, and carotid sheath xanthomas were identified on ultrasonography. Compound heterozygous mutations of the ABCG5 gene, including a hot variant (c.1,336, exon10 C > T, p.(R446*)) and a novel variant (c.1,325–3(IVS9)_c.1325–2(IVS9)delCA) were separately identified in her parents by pedigree analysis. Plant sterols analysis by high performance liquid chromatography method revealed remarkably elevated plasma plant sterol concentrations after drug withdrawal but reduced rapidly after restarting ezetimibe during follow-up period. After 21 months of treatment with ezetimibe and a low-plant sterol diet, her hematologic abnormalities, tenosynovitis, and hypercholesterolemia had significantly improved; and ultrasonography showed that her skin and carotid sheath xanthomas had resolved or shrunk. This case demonstrates that morphological changes in blood cells on a peripheral blood smear, ultrasonographic findings and ABCG5/ABCG8 gene screening are valuable, and plant sterol analysis in serum is crucial to confirm diagnosis and assess treatment adequacy for sitosterolemia.

### Multi-agent resistant thrombocytopenia in a two-year-old with Evans syndrome… [^5da2688f]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction: Evans syndrome is a chronic disorder characterized by the occurrence of two or more hematologic immune cytopenias. It is a rare diagnosis and the true prevalence is unknown. Only a handful of case reports have been documented in children. Case Report: A two-year-old male presented to his primary care physician for a well-child visit and received scheduled vaccinations. On hospital day 2, hemoglobin dropped to 12. 1 with elevated reticulocyte count and Coomb's test was positive for warm autoantibodies. He received two rounds of intravenous immune globulin and continued on steroids and he was discharged uneventfully. Two weeks later, platelets again dropped to 1000 and he was readmitted for IVIG. Due to IVIG and steroid refractoriness, he was started on weekly Rituximab for four weeks and had good improvement in platelet count but relapsed three months later with a platelet count of zero.

Management was complicated by adrenal insufficiency due to repeated steroid courses. After multiple treatment failures, relapses and exacerbations, he was started on Eltrombopag with increased doses of oral sirolimus and pulse doses of dexamethasone for severe thrombocytopenia flare-ups. His platelet counts have been within normal limits with occasional troughs as low as 80, 000 during illnesses Discussion: Evans syndrome is a rare chronic autoimmune hematologic disease. It can be diagnosed with any combination of immune thrombocytopenic purpura, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, autoimmune neutropenia or immune pancytopenia. Important differential diagnoses to exclude include autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, common variable immune deficiency, IgA deficiency, and human immune deficiency virus infection. The management of Evans syndrome remains a challenge. Most patients will relapse after tapering steroids for initial treatment.

Second line therapies include rituximab, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, vincristine, sirolimus. Thrombopoietin analogs such as romiplostim and eltrombopag have shown promise in the management of patients with Evans syndrome. Splenectomy is not recommended because of associated risks, and poor response rates after surgery with relapse within 1–2 months in most cases. Conclusion: Evans syndrome is a rare chronic hematologic autoimmune disease characterized by platelet, erythrocyte, and leukocyte destruction.

Treatment

Prednisolone (or prednisone) at high initial doses remains first-line therapy in wAIHA and is effective in 80% of the patients. After 2–3 weeks, a slow taper should start in responders, or prednisolone should be rapidly tapered and discontinued if no response. In responders, gradual tapering is advised until discontinuation within 4–6 months. First-line addition of rituximab has been shown to double the rate of long-term responses, and should be considered in patients not promptly responding to corticosteroids. It may also be considered in those presenting with haemoglobin < 8 g/dL and in IgA-mediated, mixed, or DAT-negative AIHA and Evans' syndrome.

Rituximab is the recommended second-line therapy in primary wAIHA. Failure on first-line therapy should also prompt a diagnostic re-evaluation. Third-line options include azathioprine and other immunosuppressants. Bortezomib-based combinations are also promising. Fostamatinib, a splenic tyrosine kinase inhibitor, yielded favourable results in a phase 2 trial. Long-term, low-dose prednisolone (≤ 10 mg/day) is a third-line maintenance option. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) can be useful in patients with an inadequate endogenous erythropoietin response. Splenectomy, previously often recommended in the second line, is now considered in the third or subsequent lines in low-comorbid patients who are not too old.

### An immunological syndrome featuring transverse myelitis, Evans syndrome and pulmonary infiltrates after unrelated bone marrow transplant in a patient with severe aplastic anemia [^ca1913a7]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2000). Low credibility.

A patient with severe aplastic anemia underwent a matched unrelated bone marrow transplant, following which he developed a complex autoimmune syndrome. This featured transverse myelitis, immune mediated Coombs positive hemolytic anemia and immune thrombocytopenia (Evans syndrome), pulmonary infiltrates, eosinophilia, muscle pains and cramps and lichenoid dermatitis all of which may represent manifestations of graft-versus-host disease as they showed response to immunosuppression. Thus, although immune-mediated cytopenias after an allogeneic bone marrow transplant are rare, they should be considered as a possible cause of cytopenia in post-transplant patients.

### Evaluating the prevalence of inborn errors of immunity in adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenia or Evans syndrome [^dc13b067]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Several issues surrounding the germ line genetic testing for IEIs might have affected our results. Among patients with a high pretest clinical suspicion for IEIs, the diagnostic yield of multigene panel testing ranges from 15% to 79%. This wide variability is explained partly by differences in methodology (eg, sequencing technique, number of genes evaluated, analytic and variant classification approaches) and study populations (eg, varying rates of carrier frequency and consanguinity). Compared with prior studies in pediatric Evans syndrome, this study had no cases of consanguinityand used an expert panel, which defined pathogenicity according to ACMG Standards and Guidelines, reclassifying more than one-third of commercially reported pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants as VUSs. Molecular diagnostic rates also vary among IEI phenotypic classifications. Less than 20% of those categorized as having autoinflammatory disease or predominantly antibody deficiency are molecularly diagnosed. Diagnostic yield is higher in early-onset highly penetrant disorders, such as severe combined immunodeficiency (100%), inherited bone marrow failure (55%), and syndromic IEIs (53%). We note that 6 patients who underwent screening for this study had previously been tested for IEIs, presumably based on a phenotype prompting a high pretest clinical suspicion. Two of the 6 were diagnosed with pathogenic variants in CTLA4 and FOXP3, consistent with a diagnosis of CTLA4 haploinsufficiency and immunodysregulation polyendocrinopathy enteropathy X-linked syndrome, respectively. The study population likely consisted of more subtle presentations. The negative findings in the study highlight the complexity underlying genetic determinants of autoinflammation, which may have greater variability in disease penetrance, expressivity, and polygenicity. Current knowledge of disease-causing variants might also be skewed toward early-onset, highly penetrant disorders and variants associated with subtle phenotypic presentation may be unrecognized at present. Further studies expanding on the clinical and genetic spectra of IEIs are critical. Whole-exome sequencing is underway for 1 subject with a strong family history of pediatric ITP and Evans syndrome (supplemental Figure 2).

Autoimmune cytopenias

The majority of patients with immune cytopenia respond well to treatment, and many require no intervention, but occasionally necessitate high levels of immunosuppression and supportive care with life-threatening situations. ITP is the most common autoimmune cytopenia, with an incidence of the chronic form of 5.8–6.6 per 100 000 in adults and 0.46 per 100 000 in children. ITP in children follows a chronic course in 25% of patients, and 10% require chronic immunosuppressive therapy. Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) is less frequent with an incidence of 2.6/100 000. Paediatric AIHA follows a chronic course in 20% of patients between 2 and 12 years, with a reported mortality rate of 10%. Evans' syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura are rarer, but more frequently associated with life-threatening complications with a mortality rate in children up to 30%.

Among 52 patients with ITP, AIHA and Evans' syndrome in the EBMT registry, who underwent autologous or allogeneic HSCT up to 2008 in 50 centres, OS at 5 years was 61 ± 5%. Analysis of the 24 children with immune cytopenias (19 allogeneic HSCT and 7 autologous HSCT) confirmed a 60% PFS with allogeneic HSCT vs 35% with autologous HSCT, with a TRM of 20% overall. It remains unclear whether symptomatic 'cytopenia-free survival' is best achieved with autologous or allogeneic HSCT, but, given the low number of HSCT per centre, it is unlikely that a prospective study can ever be successfully completed. Some patients have clearly benefited and harmonizing procedures may yield more interpretable data in the future through prospective non-interventional protocols.

Recommendations

HSCT may be considered for patients with ITP, AIHA and Evans' syndrome refractory to at least two lines of treatment (including rituximab and TPO receptor agonists for ITP) under the 'CO' criterion (Tables 2a and b) (level II).
For adults under 50 years, autologous HSCT should be considered if no HLA-matched sibling donor is available and is preferred over alternative donor HSCT (level II).
For paediatric patients, autologous HSCT is an option in patients with autoimmune cytopenia, where no fully HLA-compatible sibling or unrelated donor can be identified, or in patients with Evans' syndrome with no 9/10 HLA-matched unrelated donor (level II).

### Predictors of response to emergent therapies in paediatric immune thrombocytopenia [^768b2106]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is the most common acquired bleeding disorder affecting children. It is associated with a wide spectrum of bleeding symptoms, as well as reductions in health‐related quality of life (HRQoL). ITP can be primary or secondary to an underlying immune disorder such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or Evans Syndrome (ES). While most cases spontaneously resolve, up to 30% of cases will progress to chronic ITP (cITP), defined as ITP that persists beyond 12 months.

The management of paediatric ITP is guided by the severity of bleeding and the impact on HRQoL. Treatment guidelines recommend emergent therapies (ET, or 'front‐line therapies') to address acute bleeding versus observational management in the absence of bleeding, regardless of platelet count.ET available for the treatment of acute bleeding have not changed in over three decades: intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), corticosteroids and intravenous anti‐Rho(D) immunoglobulin (RhoD). Alternatively, disease‐modifying therapies (DMT, or 'second‐line therapies') are a growing group of interventions utilized in patients with persistent or chronic disease who have frequent symptoms, with the goal of raising platelets in a way that is sustained and improves HRQoL. The most frequently used DMT include thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO‐RA); immune‐modulating therapies like rituximab, mycophenolate, azathioprine and sirolimus; and splenectomy.

Varying mechanisms of ITP pathogenesis contribute to the heterogeneous clinical and treatment‐response outcomes among children with ITP. These mechanisms include autoantibody‐mediated platelet phagocytosis and destruction within the spleen and liver, antibody targeting of megakaryocyte maturation within the bone marrow, deficiencies in self‐tolerance and a functional thrombopoietin deficiency. This heterogeneity among paediatric patients with ITP necessitates a better understanding of individual risk factors and biomarkers associated with treatment response and overall clinical outcomes. All available ET are generally efficacious, including response rates of 70%–80% for IVIG. However, there are currently no known biomarkers or clinical characteristics reliably predictive of response to these ET in an individual patient. Thus, treatment of ITP remains largely trial and error, exposing patients to potentially ineffective medications, which are often expensive and associated with unnecessary adverse effects.

Through comprehensive characterization of baseline clinical features of paediatric patients with ITP treated with ET, we aimed to identify predictors of treatment response by comparing clinical characteristics of those who responded and those who did not respond to individual therapies.

### Evans syndrome in adults: an observational multicenter study [^e68530c7]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatments and relapses

All patients but 1 received at least 1 line of therapy; 76% of cases required at least 2 lines, and 54% required ≥ 3 lines. First-line therapies included steroids alone (57%) or treatment associated with IVIGs (20% of cases for both ITP and AIHA). Additional frontline treatments in primary refractory cases (23%) comprised rituximab (n = 10), immunosuppressants (n = 8), splenectomy (n = 3), danazol (n = 3), TPO-RAs (n = 2), and PEX (n = 1). Table 2 displays the total number of the various treatments administered during follow-up, along with the response rates in all patients and in ITP and AIHA separately (of note, 37 steroid and 13 rituximab courses were administered for concomitant AIHA and ITP). Supplemental Table 1 details the distribution of specific therapies across the various lines of treatment, according to the relapsing cytopenia; numbers of responders are also provided. Regarding steroids, most patients were restarted on prednisone or methylprednisolone at each relapse, either alone or in combination with an additional line of treatment (supplemental Table 1). The median duration of the first steroid course was of 9.7 months (range, 0.3–36 months; comprising the initial full-dose course of 1 mg/kg per day and a tapering/low-dose maintenance period). Overall, more than half of the patients received rituximab, mainly for AIHA, one-third received an immunosuppressor (azathioprine, n = 10; cyclosporine, n = 6; cyclophosphamide, n = 8; and mycophenolate mofetil, n = 8), one-third received a TPO-RA (n = 27), and 10% underwent splenectomy. Interestingly, overall response rates were invariably > 80%. The median duration of response (DOR; ie, the time from treatment to the next relapse) to rituximab was 16 months (range, 1.9–197 months) for AIHA, 16 months (range, 10–56 months) for ITP, and 31 months (range, 10–161 months) for concomitant ITP and AIHA, whereas 30% of patients never relapsed. DOR for splenectomy was 75 months (range, 19–171 months) for ITP and 16 months (range, 2–109 months) for AIHA; 31% never relapsed. Finally, a minority of patients (8%) received other treatments, including danazol (n = 5), PEX (n = 2), recombinant erythropoietin (n = 1), and the oral phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor parsaclisib in a clinical trial (n = 1). In patients with AIN, no specific treatment was administered aside from anti-infective therapy or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (n = 3) in case of infection. During follow-up, 165 cases of ITP, 103 cases of AIHA, and 16 concomitant relapses occurred. Figure 2A shows cumulative incidence curves for relapses and infectious and thrombotic events. Factors associated with a lower risk of relapse after first treatment were the frontline use of IVIGs in association with steroids (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.27–0.92; P = 0.03), along with female sex (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.36–0.86; P < .01) and presence of normal IgM level (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.23–0.97; P = 0.04). No associations have been found between relapse occurrence and autoantibody positivity, nor with presence of molecular abnormalities by NGS. Notably, during the study period, patients with secondary ES did not receive treatment for the underlying condition, except for substitutive IVIGs in those with common variable immunodeficiency.

### Long term follow-up of pediatric-onset Evans syndrome: broad immunopathological manifestations and high treatment burden [^54cd05f7]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Hematological outcomes

AIN developed in 43 patients (28.5%). It was diagnosed within 1 month before or after first cytopenia onset in 23 of 43 cases (53.5%), more than 1 month before in two cases (4.7%), and more than 1 month after in 18 cases (41.9%; maximal delay, 12.4 years). In all cases, the diagnosis was made before the age of 18 years (median age, 6.8 years; range, 0.6–16.2 years).

ITP and AIHA flare rates at 5 years of follow-up were calculated for the 61 alive patients who did not receive a second-line treatment during this period. Forty-eight patients (79%) had experienced an ITP flare and seven (11%) an AIHA flare.

The proportion of patients achieving sustained CR for ITP and AIHA steadily increased after cytopenia onset (Figure 1A). At 5 and 10 years, ITP was in sustained CR in 40.5% and 62.3% of patients (P = 0.02) and AIHA was in sustained CR in 54.5% and 74.1% of patients (P = 0.001), respectively. Sustained CR was achieved earlier for AIHA than ITP (median time to CR, 4.0 years vs. 7.0 years; P = 0.01). At the final follow-up of the 135 surviving patients, the numbers of patients in CR, partial remission, and no remission were 126 (83%), five (3%), and one (1%) for AIHA and 119 (79%), eight (5%), and five (3%) for ITP, respectively (missing data in three cases). Forty-six patients (34%) had no treatment ongoing at last followup. No particular characteristic was associated with AIHA or ITP CR, including cIM and bIM.

Table 1.
Patient characteristics.

Over the first three decades, the proportions of patients achieving sustained CR increased with age (Figure 1B). ITP and AIHA were in CR in 26% and 30% of cases at 10 years compared to 50% and 72% at 20 years, respectively (P < 0.001 for both comparisons).

### Long term follow-up of pediatric-onset Evans syndrome: broad immunopathological manifestations and high treatment burden [^cbbf0d38]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatments

All except two patients (98.6%) had received at least one first-line treatment course. Second-line treatments (regardless of the hematological and/or extra-hematological indication) were required in 117 of 151 (77%) patients (Online Supplementary Figure 3A). Patients who did not receive any second-line treatment had shorter median follow- up times (10.5 years vs. 12.3 years; P = 0.017). The median number of second-line treatments received was two (range, 0–9).

The number of second-line treatments received increased with the time elapsed since first cytopenia without reaching a plateau (Online Supplementary Figure 3B). After a sustained CR for both ITP and AIHA achieved, the number of treatments received had continued to increase: at 5 years after CR of both cytopenias, 67% of patients who achieved CR for both ITP and AIHA had received a new first and/or second-line treatments and 31% had received a new second-line treatment (Online Supplementary Figure S3C).

The number of second-line treatments received increased with age, particularly after the first decade (Figure 4A). At 10 and 20 years, 47% and 88% of patients had received a second-line treatment, respectively (P < 0.001). The number of patients receiving ongoing treatments also increased with age (Figure 4B). At 10 and 20 years, 27% and 69% of patients had received an active second-line treatment, respectively (P < 0.001). At the final follow-up, patients with a cIM had received more secondline treatments (median, 3 vs. 1; P < 0.0001).

The most frequently used second-line treatments were rituximab (n = 79; 52%), azathioprine (n = 55; 36%), splenectomy (n = 36; 24%), and mycophenolate (n = 29; 19%; Online Supplementary Table S3).

The number of cIM was associated with a subsequent increase in the number of second-line treatments received (HR 1.4; 95% CI: 1.15–1.60; P = 0.0002). On the contrary, the number of second-line treatment was not associated to a subsequent increase in the number of cIM in univariate analysis (HR 1.09; 95% CI: 0.98–1.22; P = 0.11).

### Long term follow-up of pediatric-onset Evans syndrome: broad immunopathological manifestations and high treatment burden [^ded56db8]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Mortality

Sixteen of the 151 patients followed for more than 5 years (10.6%) died, and seven other patients died before the fifth year of follow-up (23 deaths in total, 22 with available data). Patient survival at 5, 10, and 15 years after the first cytopenia was 97%, 92%, and 84%, respectively (Figure 5A). Mortality rates in patients with pES were higher than those in patients with cITP or AIHA alone (P < 0.0001 for both comparisons).

Deaths occurred regularly throughout the follow-up period (median delay after first cytopenia diagnosis, 8.9 years [range, 0.1–24.3 years]) and at a median age of 18.0 years (range, 1.7–31.5 years) (Figure 5B). In the majority of these patients, cytopenia was under control at the time of death: 15 (65%) and 19 (83%) patients had CR or partial remission from ITP and AIHA, respectively (Figure 5C). Mortality was linked to the disease, the treatment, or both in eight (36%), two (9%), and twelve (55%) cases, respectively. The most frequent cause of death was infections (n = 12 [52%]; Online Supplementary Table S5). Four patients (18%) died of a hemorrhage, and all were less than 13 years of age. The patients who died from a hemorrhage were younger than those who died from an infection (median 10 years vs. 18 years; P = 0.03). All of these patients, except for one who died in the first month of a cerebral hemorrhage, had at least one cIM. Eight of the patients (36%) had hypogammaglobulinemia.

### Incidence of ventriculomegaly in patients with craniosynostosis [^b98b2065]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 1
Computed tomography imaging findings of syndrome craniosynostosis. (A) Crouzon syndrome, Evans index > 0.3. (B) Apert syndrome, Evans index > 0.3.

The situation is somehow different in nonsyndrome CS, since only 3 (2.3%) patients were diagnosed with hydrocephalus, and all 3 had unicoronal synostosis. Of note, it was observed that ∼46% (23/50) of patients with sagittal synostosis had an EI between 0.25 and 0.3, indicating mild ventricular enlargement. This may be attributed to sagittal synostosis itself, which leads to an increase in the anteroposterior diameter of the skull and a decrease in the biparietal diameter (Fig. 2 A).

FIGURE 2
Computed tomography imaging findings of nonsyndrome craniosynostosis. (A) Sagittal synostosis, Evans index > 0.3. (B) Unicoronal craniosynostosis, Evans index > 0.3.

Ventricular enlargement is common and seen in both syndrome and nonsyndrome CS. In our study, the occurrence rates were 24.3% and 19.7%, respectively, which are higher than those in normal children. And in most cases, the indication for the best timing and treatment option for CS are mainly based on the severity of ventricular enlargement or evidence of intracranial hypertension. Moreover, in some syndrome CS, ventricular dilation does not necessarily correlate with significant hydrocephalus but may reflect primary cerebral maldevelopment. Thus, any ventricular enlargement deserves more attention.

Overall, overt hydrocephalus is variously associated with Crouzon, while nontense ventricular enlargement is often encountered in Apert. Meanwhile, in nonsyndromic CS, hydrocephalus is more prevalent in unicoronal CS, while mild ventricular enlargement is often seen in sagittal suture CS. Since posterior cranial expansion or cranial remodeling may address posterior cranial fossa constriction and stabilize ventricular dilation, further research is needed to determine the best timing for those CS patients with nontense ventriculomegaly.

Conclusion

We found reliable agreement among the three observers in tumour size, tumour volume, and Evans index. Invasion of regions of interest generally tended to have higher agreement levels than compression. Our results demonstrate challenges in quantifying imaging biomarkers in the context of cerebellar mutism syndrome due to the complex anatomy of the posterior fossa.

### Massive intrasplenic arterial thrombosis in a patient with chronic ITP during the development of an Evans syndrome [^5b27b1b9]. Thrombosis Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Long-term safety and efficacy of eltrombopag in adults with persitent/chronic primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) evaluated in EXTEND study, showed a high response rate (80%) but, in the clinical safety study, it was observed that 6% of the patients presented venous and arterial thrombotic events. In addition, in the course of the disease, autoimmune hemolytic anemia (Evans syndrome, ES) may occur and could increase the risk of thrombosis. We report an interesting case of splenic rupture due to massive intrasplenic arterial thrombosis in the course of ES in a patient with chronic ITP treated with eltrombopag. The purpose of this case report is to highlight the potential increase in thrombotic risk that may involve the use of eltrombopag in hemolysis situations in patients with ITP.

### Predictors of refractory risk in systemic lupus erythematosus-related thrombocytopenia: a dual-centre retrospective study [^3dc83adf]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Activation of C3 plays an important role in the pathophysiology of SLE. A longitudinal SLE cohort has reported that compared with C4, C3 is a more important marker of poor prognosis. Decreased C3 has been reported to serve as an independent risk factor for relapse and poor prognosis in SLE-related TP, and low C3 levels in immune thrombocytopenia are associated with severity and a tendency towards refractoriness of TP. In our study, an association between low baseline C3 levels and a high risk of SLE-related RTP was also found.

Haematological involvement in SLE is mainly characterised by cytopenias due to autoimmunity, including immune thrombocytopenia, anaemia and leucopenia. In our data, the combination of AIHA and TP in patients with SLE could lead to the refractoriness. The presence of multiple cytopenias in SLE suggests that clinicians should be aware of the secondary Evans syndrome. Evans syndrome is an autoimmune condition that presents with two or more cytopenias, which commonly includes AIHA and immune thrombocytopenia which reflects a state of profound immune dysregulation.SLE is one of the most common causes of secondary Evans syndrome. In a large proportion of patients with SLE secondary Evans syndrome, TP and AIHA occur simultaneously, and high disease activity and decreased C3 are common. As reported by a cohort study, SLE with Evans syndrome often has longer courses of induction remission therapy and more severe flares with more frequent relapses than primary Evans syndrome. Failure rates of GC, IS and IVIG therapy in SLE secondary Evans syndrome are relatively high, and after treatment failure or recurrence, the subsequent application of second-line treatments, such as blood purification, RTX and bortezomib, has good effects. Currently, Evans syndrome is still considered as a diagnosis of exclusion reflects a state of profound immune dysregulation. These results combined with our data suggested that clinicians should pay attention to the association between the combination of AIHA and TP and the refractoriness of the disease, meanwhile, meticulous differential diagnosis should be made to identify secondary Evans syndrome to make appropriate clinical decisions.

Methods

OBS'CEREVANCE prospective national cohort

Inclusion and exclusion criteria are shown in the Online Supplementary Table S1. Data collected have been previously detailed. Patients were included if < 18 years old at first cytopenia diagnosis. The coordinating center gathered and analyzed all data from the medical team in charge in real time, enabling prospective follow-up even after the pediatric-to-adult transition. The CEREVANCE group recommends scheduling clinical and biological follow-up at least every 6–12 months. Some patients underwent genetic analyses, as previously described. Written informed consent was obtained from parents and eligible patients. The cohort study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee (CPPRB-A; Bordeaux, France) and the database was registered with the national data protection authority (CNIL, 1396823V0).

Patient selection

Patients with pES, defined as the simultaneous (within 1 month) or sequential association of ITP and AIHA, were included if at least 5 years of follow-up data were available after the first cytopenia diagnosis. In order to provide a complete mortality report, all patients, including those with less than 5 years of follow-up data, were included in the survival analyses. The data were extracted on 21 June 2019.

Definitions

Initial cytopenia refers to the onset of ITP or AIHA (whichever occurred first) and does not take autoimmune neutropenia (AIN) into account. The IM categories were separated in clinical (cIM) and biological (bIM). pES was defined as secondary if a diagnosis of SLE or PID was made during the follow-up period. SLE diagnosis was made according to the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics Classification criteria (SLICC). ALPS diagnosis was based on international criteria. Second-line treatments were all immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive treatments, including splenectomy but excluding steroids and therapeutic intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG). Sustained complete remission (CR) was defined as remission persisting until final follow-up, regardless of ongoing treatments.

For analyses by age, patients were assessed annually from birth (for IM and treatments) or from cytopenia onset (for AIHA and ITP), until final follow-up. Occasional treatments (e.g. splenectomy and rituximab) were considered as ongoing if these occurred during the previous year. Further details are stated in the Online Supplementary Table S1.

We retrospectively evaluated patients with diagnosed ES and observed from June 1987 at 10 European tertiary hematologic hospitals (5 in Italy, 2 in Denmark, 1 in the United Kingdom, and 2 in Spain), who had received at least 1 TPO-RA agent for ITP. ES was diagnosed based on the concomitant or sequential onset of at least 2 immune cytopenias (ITP, AIHA, and/or AIN), each diagnosed according to current guidelines. The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the local ethics committee. Response rates were evaluated at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, and classified as partial (PR) or complete (CR) response, for platelets (PLTs) > 30×10⁹/L or > 100×10⁹/L, respectively. Emergent treatment adverse events (TAEs) were registered and graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. In a second analysis, we compared baseline features, response to TPO-RAs, TAEs, and outcome in an ES cohort with a control group of 87 patients with primary ITP treated with TPO-RAs at the center of the first and senior authors BF and WB.

### Benefits of rituximab as a second-line treatment for autoimmune haemolytic anaemia in children: a prospective French cohort study [^3f8df5d3]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Childhood autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) requires second-line immunosuppressive therapy in 30–50% of cases. It appears that rituximab is indicated in such circumstances. This prospective national study reports the practice, efficacy and tolerance of rituximab in children with isolated AIHA and AIHA in the setting of Evans syndrome (ES). Sixty-one children were given rituximab between 2000 and 2014. The median interval from diagnosis to rituximab was 9·9 [interquartile range (IQR) 1·6–28·5] months. Forty-six patients responded (75%) and the 6-year relapse-free survival (RFS) was 48%. Twenty patients relapsed at a median interval of 10·8 (IQR 3·9–18·7) months, rituximab allowed steroid withdrawal in 44/61 (72%) of children. In isolated AIHA, complete response and 6-year RFS were significantly higher than in ES (P < 0·05). Ten out of 61 patients were infants, seven of who responded with a 6-year RFS of 71%. Among patients without immunoglobulin substitution before rituximab, 4 are still receiving substitutions. Five patients died, including one potentially attributable to rituximab. This large observational series of childhood AIHA established the rituximab benefit-risk ratio, allowing steroid withdrawal, with 37% of long-term responders, mainly in isolated AIHA. All subgroups of patients drew benefit. Our long-term results indicate the baseline to be challenged by new treatment approaches.

Types of AIHA and recommended management

Warm-antibody AIHA

Epidemiology and pathogenesis

The incidence of AIHA was found to be 18 per million per year in Denmark, wAIHA accounting for 65–75%. Warm-autoantibodies have highest affinity for the antigen at 37 °C and are polyclonal, mostly of the IgG class, but IgM warm antibodies or IgA can also be involved. A major haemolytic pathway is antibody-dependent destruction of RBCs by macrophages (extravascular haemolysis), mainly in the spleen. The classical complement pathway is involved in half of the cases, resulting in phagocytosis of complement protein fragment 3b (C3b)-opsonized cells (extravascular haemolysis).

Half of wAIHA cases are secondary, i.e. associated with other lymphoproliferative or immunologic diseases (Table 2). Evans' syndrome is defined as the concomitant or sequential occurrence of two autoimmune cytopenias (usually wAIHA with immune thrombocytopenia).WAIHA is a chronic relapsing rather than a chronic disease. Patients have an increased risk of thrombosis.

### Outcomes and treatment strategies for autoimmunity and hyperinflammation in patients with RAG deficiency [^a8ef6334]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Although autoimmunity and hyperinflammation secondary to recombination activating gene (RAG) deficiency have been associated with delayed diagnosis and even death, our current understanding is limited primarily to small case series.

Objective

Understand the frequency, severity, and treatment responsiveness of autoimmunity and hyperinflammation in RAG deficiency.

Methods

In reviewing the literature and our own database, we identified 85 patients with RAG deficiency, reported between 2001 and 2016, and compiled the largest case series to date of 63 patients with prominent autoimmune and/or hyperinflammatory pathology.

Results

Diagnosis of RAG deficiency was delayed a median of 5 years from the first clinical signs of immune dysregulation. Most patients (55.6%) presented with more than 1 autoimmune or hyperinflammatory complication, with the most common etiologies being cytopenias (84.1%), granulomas (23.8%), and inflammatory skin disorders (19.0%). Infections, including live viral vaccinations, closely preceded the onset of autoimmunity in 28.6% of cases. Autoimmune cytopenias had early onset (median, 1.9, 2.1, and 2.6 years for autoimmune hemolytic anemia, immune thrombocytopenia, and autoimmune neutropenia, respectively) and were refractory to intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids, and rituximab in most cases (64.7%, 73.7%, and 71.4% for autoimmune hemolytic anemia, immune thrombocytopenia, and autoimmune neutropenia, respectively). Evans syndrome specifically was associated with lack of response to first-line therapy. Treatment-refractory autoimmunity/hyperinflammation prompted hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in 20 patients.

Conclusions

Autoimmunity/hyperinflammation can be a presenting sign of RAG deficiency and should prompt further evaluation. Multilineage cytopenias are often refractory to immunosuppressive treatment and may require hematopoietic cell transplantation for definitive management.

NCCN Esophageal and esophagogastric junction (EGJ) cancers — screening upper endoscopy with biopsies should be considered for patients who have the hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes as indicated below, and all recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated. For esophageal cancer, tylosis with non-epidermolytic palmoplantar keratosis (PPK) and Howel-Evans syndrome, screening by upper GI endoscopy is recommended in family members with tylosis after 20 years of age. For familial Barrett esophagus (FBE), potential family history of BE, esophageal adenocarcinoma, or EGJ adenocarcinoma should be determined for patients presenting with GERD, especially white males > 40 years of age, and screening for BE by upper GI endoscopy is recommended in family members with FBE after 40 years of age, especially if the individual has a history of GERD. For Bloom syndrome (BS), screening for GERD with or without endoscopy to screen for early cancer after 20 years of age may be considered. For Fanconi anemia (FA), endoscopy of the esophagus may be considered as a screening strategy in individuals identified with FA.

### Autoimmune cytopenias (AIC) following allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant for acquired aplastic anaemia: a joint study of the autoimmune diseases and severe aplastic anaemia working parties (ADWP / SAAWP) of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) [^75433a0a]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Most ITP patients were treated with corticosteroid or IVIg, while rituximab was infrequently used. Fifty percent of ITP patients achieved either CR or PR with each line of therapy. In the general population a response to first-line steroids of up to 80% has been reported, and the combination of IVIg with corticosteroid therapy may hasten platelet recovery. In randomized studies, the combination of rituximab with dexamethasone compared with dexamethasone alone has been shown to improve response rates from 36–37 to 58–63%. Case reports and series of patients with ITP post HSCT have reported response rates of 30–50% following first and second-line treatment, with the former largely consisting of corticosteroid with or without IVIg, and the latter IVIg, rituximab or splenectomy. In cases of post-HSCT ITP refractory to standard therapy, thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) have proven effective. In our cohort no patients were treated with TPO-RAs, which may reflect European Medicines Agency licensing of romiplostim in 2009 and eltrombopag in 2010, during the last 3 years of our study eligibility period.

Although randomized data are lacking, corticosteroids are an established first-line therapy for AIHA with retrospective studies reporting responses of ~75%. Again, there is limited evidence for second-line therapy, but rituximab or splenectomy are the most commonly described. Similar strategies are reported in the management of paediatric and adult Evans syndrome. Patients in our study were largely treated according to this paradigm: all patients with AIHA received first-line corticosteroid with or without IVIg. One patient requiring second-line therapy was re-treated with corticosteroids; and all others received second-line rituximab with all patients achieving a CR or PR. Evans syndrome appeared the most challenging AIC to treat, with the greatest proportion of non-responders. However, there was no excess of deaths in this group compared with other AIC diagnoses. In cases series of patients with AIHA post-HSCT, 14–33% response rates are reported with prednisolone alone and 40–45% with prednisolone in combination with rituximab or IVIg. In these series, up to 33% of patients were reported refractory to therapy, whereas all patients in our series were in CR or PR at last follow-up.

### Long term follow-up of pediatric-onset Evans syndrome: broad immunopathological manifestations and high treatment burden [^992ca774]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Immunopathological manifestations

A total of 122 of 151 patients (81%) had at least one IM. The data for each category and specific diagnosis are shown in the Online Supplementary Table S2.

cIM developed in 100 of 151 patients (66%). A total of 47 patients (31%) had two or more IM and 22 (15%) patients had three or more IM (Online Supplementary Figure S2A). Patients with no cIM had shorter median follow-up times (9.7 years vs. 13 years; P = 0.0002) and were younger when data were collected (15 years vs. 20 years; P < 0.0001). A cIM was diagnosed before the first cytopenia in 21 of 100, simultaneously in 13, and after in 66 cases (median delay, 3.7 years [range, 0.2–20.5 years]; Figure 2A). Among the 185 cIM, 29 (16%) were diagnosed before any second-line treatment. No cIM category had a statistically significant difference in frequency before and after first second-line treatment. The number of cIM increased with age. At 10 compared to 20 years old, 37% and 74% of patients had at least one cIM and 9% and 34% of patients had at least two cIM, respectively (P < 0.001 for both comparisons; Figure 2B).

The most common cIM categories were lymphoproliferation (n = 71), dermatological (n = 26), gastrointestinal/hepatic (n = 23) and pneumological manifestations (n = 16, Figure 3; Online Supplementary Figure S2B). The most frequent cIM diagnosis are shown in Table 2. Thirteen patients developed a neurological manifestation as previously described. Four patients had a hematological malignancy (age at diagnosis): Hodgkin lymphoma (16 years), juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (20 years), large granular lymphocytic leukemia (21 years) and angioimmunoblastic Tcell lymphoma (29 years). Older age at ES diagnosis (HR 1.09; 95% CI: 1.01–1.17; P = 0.02), cIM/cancer in a firstdegree relative (HR 1.64; 95% CI: 1.1–2.4; P = 0.006), and the presence of AIN were independently associated with the number of cIM (HR 2.41; 95% CI: 1.5–3.8; P = 0.0002).

### Ras-MAPK pathway in patients with lupus nephritis [^1ee1451e]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the current study, we found that mucocutaneous, cardiac manifestations and reduction of Treg cells are dominant features of patients harbouring mutations in genes encoding components of the Ras-MAPK pathway. Furthermore, we identified that the Ras-MAPK pathway is activated in both PBMC and kidney tissues from patients with LN. The findings illustrate a close association of Ras-MAPK pathway activity with SLE pathology.

Gene mutations involved in the Ras-MAPK pathway cause a disorder named RASopathy, which shares common traits, such as craniofacial dysmorphisms, short stature, cardiac malformations, variable cognitive delay and an increased risk of cancer development. There were no obvious craniofacial abnormalities and short stature in our cohort, but the patients presented with varying degrees of cardiac involvement, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, regurgitation, reduced ejection fraction and cardiac dilatation. Patients with KRAS and NRAS mutations had manifestations of lymphoproliferative diseases, which is consistent with previous studies. Notably, it was reported that 52% of patients with RASopathy presented with at least one autoantibody; 14% of the patients fulfilled the criteria of autoimmune disorders, such as autoimmune thyroiditis, SLE, coeliac disease, antiphospholipid syndrome, vitiligo and autoimmune hepatitis. In our cohort, there were prominent autoimmune manifestations, such as the presence of SLE, antiphospholipid antibodies, autoimmune thyroid disease-associated antibodies, Evans syndrome and vitiligo. These autoimmune manifestations in our cohort have been previously described in RASopathy, except for Evans syndrome. Evans syndrome has both immune thrombocytopenia and autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. Sixty-five per cent of paediatric Evans syndrome were found to have an underlying immune-related monogenic disorder. This study provides the first association of Evans syndrome with NRAS gene mutation, which is likely very rare. These findings warranted the importance of genetic testing in patients with LN with cardiac involvement, lymphoproliferative disorders and Evans syndrome.

### Evans syndrome in adults: an observational multicenter study [^9412cf7b]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

The treatments administered were collected, including steroids, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs), rituximab, splenectomy, cytotoxic immunosuppression (immunosuppressive therapy, including azathioprine, cyclosporin A, mycophenolate mofetil, and cyclophosphamide), thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) eltrombopag and romiplostim, recombinant erythropoietin, and plasma exchange (PEX). Treatment outcome was evaluated as overall response, described as PLTs > 30×10⁹/L with at least a doubling of the baseline count in ITP and Hb > 10 g/dL without transfusion and with reduction of markers of hemolysis in AIHA. Relapses of any cytopenia (ITP, AIHA, and/or AIN), either alone or combined, were registered and considered in the analysis; relapse-free survival after first ES therapy calculated. Infectious, thrombotic, and bleeding complications were collected and graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 5). Occurrence of death and relative causes were registered for all patients, and overall survival (OS) from ES diagnosis was estimated.

Statistical analysis

Kruskal-Wallis and χ² tests were used for comparison of quantitative and categorical variables, respectively. We performed 3 types of survival/incidence analyses after truncating follow-up time (time since diagnosis) at 25 years. Firstly, we analyzed cumulative incidence of selected intermediate events (first occurrence of relapse, infection, or thrombosis; a patient may have experienced > 1 intermediate event). In these analyses, we calculated and plotted cumulative incidence for each type of event. Death resulting from any cause was treated as a competing event. Secondly, we analyzed OS and mortality using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. Thirdly, we analyzed OS and death rates after each type of intermediate event. To avoid immortal-time bias, each event was considered as a time-dependent variable (ie, a patient who experienced an intermediate event was classified as not having that intermediate event until its occurrence and as having the event after that event occurred). In these analyses, we calculated death rates (per 100 person-years). For all outcomes (intermediate events and death), hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for selected variables using univariate and multivariable proportional Cox hazards regression models. When analyzing mortality, we included in the model the covariates age, relapse, infection, and thrombosis (all treated as time-varying variables). Statistical analyses were performed with Stata software (StataCorp, College Station, TX).

### Evans syndrome in adults: an observational multicenter study [^9a9687b5]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Baseline features

Overall, 116 patients (51% female) with a median age at ES diagnosis of 51 years (range, 1.9–94.8 years) and followed for a median of 7.5 years (range, 2–31 years) were included in the study. Three patients experienced their first cytopenia in infancy (Figure 1) but were referred to the participating center for the first time in adulthood when the second cytopenia occurred, leading to ES diagnosis; their hematologic parameters at the first episode were not included in the analysis. Of note, a comprehensive workup (lymphoid subpopulation, Ig level, CT scan, and PID gene panel) excluded a PID in these cases. Table 1 shows clinical and laboratory baseline characteristics of the patients. Regarding ES type, a majority of cases had combined ITP and AIHA (81%), followed by the triple combination of ITP, AIHA, and AIN in 10% of patients. Isolated thrombocytopenia, anemia, and their simultaneous occurrence had the same frequency at ES onset (1 of 3 each), whereas neutropenia was rarer (4%). Hematologic parameters at disease onset were highly variable, depending on the prevailing AIC: 41% had severe anemia (Hb < 8 g/dL), 47% had increased LDH (> 1.5× upper limit of normal [ULN]), 58% had severe thrombocytopenia (< 30 × 10⁹/L), and 12% had severe neutropenia (< 0.5 × 10⁹/L). Regarding autoimmunity tests (Table 1), 89% of tested patients had a positive DAT, mainly for warm IgG with or without complement (86%), 6 patients had DAT− AIHA (diagnosed after the exclusion of all other causes of hemolysis and given response to steroids), and 84% displayed positive anti-PLT autoantibodies. Anti-neutrophil antibodies were tested in only 19 cases and were positive in 45%. Finally, non–organ-specific autoantibodies were positive in > 50% of cases (including antinuclear antibodies, extractable nuclear antigens, and anti-DNA), and antiphospholipids (including anticardiolipin, anti–β2 glycoprotein 1, and LAC) were positive in up to 18% of tested cases.

### Association of a positive direct antiglobulin test with chronic immune thrombocytopenia and use of second line therapies in children: a multi-institutional review [^5c6eb570]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is the most common autoimmune cytopenia in children. Approximately, 25% of patients develop chronic disease, which may be unpredictable and challenging to treat. It is not currently possible to predict at the time of presentation which patients will have chronic disease or will experience symptoms requiring second-line therapy defined as treatment beyond corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, or Rh immune globulin. A multi-institutional retrospective review of 311 pediatric patients with ITP was performed with the goal of identifying clinical characteristics associated with disease course. In a cohort of 216 patients tested and for whom disease status was known, a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) was associated with chronic ITP vs spontaneous resolution of disease (29.2% vs 8.1%, P < 0.001) as well as the need for treatment with second line agents (38.5% vs 11.4%, P < 0.001) in 241 patients. Controlling for the effect of Evans syndrome, defined as having two immune cytopenias, a positive DAT was independently associated with chronic ITP (OR = 2.7, 95% CI: 1.0–7.2, P = 0.041) and use of second-line agents (OR: 3.6, 95% CI: 1.7–7.7, P = 0.001) by multivariate logistic regression model. These findings demonstrate an association with positive DAT and chronic disease, as well as refractory disease requiring second-line agents.

### Thrombopoietin receptor agonists in adult Evans syndrome: an international multicenter experience [^89411a34]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

Table 1.
Clinical and hematological features of patients with ES enrolled before TPO-RA treatment

All patients had received treatment for ITP (median, 6 lines; range, 1–8), including steroids with or without IVIG in almost all cases (96%), rituximab (59% of patients), cytotoxic immunosuppressors (cyclosporine, mycophenolate, and azathioprine; 34%), splenectomy (26%), and danazol (11%). Responses are shown in Table 1. The median time from diagnosis to beginning treatment with a TPO-RA was 20 months (range, 1–1381), and treatment indication was nonresponse to previous or ongoing therapy in all cases. Twenty-three patients received eltrombopag (79%) and 6 romiplostim (21%), with a median maximal dose of 75 mg/d (50–150) and 3 μg/kg per week (range, 2–10), respectively. PLT values showed a progressive increase (Figure 1A), resulting in response rates (CR+PR) of 86% at month +1, 80% at month +3, 84% at month +6 and 96% at month +12 (Figure 1B). Of note, 86% of patients were receiving concomitant therapies at the time of initial treatment with a TPO-RA, including steroids with or without IVIG (n = 19), rituximab (n = 5), immunosuppressants (n = 3), and danazol (n = 4). Overall, the median duration of therapy was 12 months (1–71), and 10 patients were able to stop TPO-RA treatment for persistent CR (ie, treatment-free remission); however, 8 subsequently relapsed and required TPO-RA rechallenge (median relapse-free survival, 6 months; range, 3–66). Additional reasons for cessation of TPO-RA were nonresponse (n = 4) and TAEs (thrombosis, n = 3; thrombocytosis, n = 3; and increased bone marrow fibrosis MF-2, n = 1). Interestingly, 5 subjects were switched to an alternative TPO-RA (3 romiplostim to eltrombopag and 2 vice versa): 2 because of nonresponse and 3 for relapse. Of those, 3 patients responded. In addition, during TPO-RA treatment 10 subjects required additional rescue therapies because of intercurrent decrease in PLTs (steroids with or without IVIG, n = 4; cytotoxic immunosuppressants, n = 3; danazol, n = 1; dapsone, n = 1; and splenectomy, n = 1).

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^ab92f57d]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) — workup and grade-based management for patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICPI) therapy are as follows. Workup includes history and physical examination focused on viral illness and lymphocyte‑depleting therapies, family or personal history of autoimmunity, CBC with peripheral smear and reticulocyte count, bone marrow evaluation only if abnormalities are present or further workup is necessary, testing for HIV, HCV, HBV, and H. pylori in newly diagnosed ITP, and checking a direct antiglobin test to rule out concurrent Evans' syndrome; nutritional evaluation and bone marrow evaluation are advised if other cell lines are affected with concern for aplastic anemia. For G1 with platelet count 75 to < 100/ μL, continue ICPI with close clinical follow-up and laboratory evaluation. For G2 with platelet count 50 to < 75/ μL, hold ICPI but monitor for improvement and, if not resolved, interrupt treatment until AE has reverted to G1; administer prednisone 1 mg/kg per day (dosage range, 0.5–2 mg/kg per day) daily for 4 weeks followed by taper over 4–6 weeks to the lowest effective dose; intravenous immunoglobulin may be used with corticosteroids if a more rapid platelet rise is required.

### Double hit: Evans syndrome after malignant thymoma treatment and parvovirus B19 infection [^b940d6ee]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Malignancies are often associated with autoimmune diseases, which are addressed by treating the underlying cancer. However, there are rare malignancies that can cause autoimmune diseases even after appropriate treatment. Our patient is a 39-year-old Hispanic man with a malignant thymoma recently treated with chemotherapy and radiation who presented with syncope and dyspnoea. He was found to be both anaemic and thrombocytopenic. His labs were consistent with autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA), except his reticulocyte count was unexpectedly low. Bone marrow biopsy supported a diagnosis of Evans syndrome, a rare autoimmune condition characterised by (AIHA) combined with immune thrombocytopenia. He was also found to have an acute parvovirus B19 infection. He was treated with steroids and RBC transfusion. His blood counts gradually returned to baseline, with improvement in symptoms. This patient's thymoma treatment and active parvovirus B19 infection likely both played a role in the development of Evans syndrome.

### Pediatric antiphospholipid syndrome: clinical features and therapeutic interventions in a single center retrospective case series [^04ea748e]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This case series adds to the relatively limited body of knowledge about children who develop APS and provides some important information that could inspire new ideas about how to best diagnose, manage, and research pediatric APS. For example, this series again highlights the burden of non-criteria clinical manifestations in the pediatric population and reinforces the need for pediatric-specific classification criteria. Patients who present with features such as the so-called Evans Syndrome (autoimmune hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia), for example, likely warrant testing for APS. Of note, the 15 th International Congress on Antiphospholipid Antibodies Task Force on Pediatric Antiphospholipid Syndrome published a report that highlighted the different characteristics seen in pediatric APS and also underlined the importance of large, age-stratified studies to better identify risk for thrombotic events and to test the hypothesis that adult criteria may not be as useful in children. Our data also confirm that testing for ANA is not a good screening test for APS because it was only positive in 43% of all patients with APS and none of the patients with primary APS. If a diagnosis of APS is being considered, then screening should be with aPL rather than relying on ANA as a surrogate marker.

There are no pediatric-specific laboratory cut-offs for aPL with percentiles based on healthy adults. Centers may consider determining an appropriate cut-off value for positive or negative aPL results based on pediatric controls. In our series, anti-PS/PT was tested in just two patients and was positive in both. One patient presented with thrombotic microangiopathy, and their other aPL either became negative after the use of plasmapheresis and rituximab or, in the case of lupus anticoagulant, could not be relied upon because of the use of heparin products. Hence, anti-PS/PT could potentially provide useful diagnostic information in cases in which APS is strongly suspected but unable to be confirmed with current criteria lab testing. Interestingly, there have been two case reports of pediatric APS patients with positive anti-PS/PT and thrombotic microangiopathy. One other series of APS patients evaluating anti-PS/PT included pediatric patients and showed a significant association between test positivity and APS; it could even be used to diagnose clinical cases when other aPL were negative. Further research in this area seems warranted.

### High P-glycoprotein-mediated export observed in patients with a history of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura [^932ce93f]. British Journal of Haematology (2002). Low credibility.

Studies have suggested that high P-glycoprotein expression in lymphocytes from patients with autoimmune disorders may affect disease outcome. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and Evans' syndrome are widely thought to be autoimmune processes, however, the precise mechanisms remain unknown. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with refractory or recurrent ITP or Evans' syndrome were studied using the rhodamine 123 flow cytometric assay to investigate functional export levels. Lymphocytes from ITP and Evans' syndrome patients showed a significantly decreased ability to retain rhodamine, suggesting increased export protein function. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction distinguished P-glycoprotein as the likely export protein.
