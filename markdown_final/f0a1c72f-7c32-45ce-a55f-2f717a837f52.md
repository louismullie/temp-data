## Question

How to treat pneumonia in kids

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat pediatric pneumonia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify severity and choose the site of care. Then, I should verify the likely etiologies by age and setting. Next, I will review when antibiotics are indicated versus when watchful waiting is reasonable. After that, I need to check first-line antibiotic choices, dosing, and duration, including stewardship principles. I will then examine supportive care, including oxygen and fluids. I should also consider special populations such as young infants and those with comorbidities. Finally, I will outline follow-up, treatment failure pathways, and prevention strategies, making sure each step aligns with current guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the severity framework and site-of-care decision, because this drives everything downstream. Non-severe pneumonia typically presents with cough or difficulty breathing with age-specific tachypnea and no danger signs, warranting outpatient care, whereas severe disease includes chest indrawing, nasal flaring, grunting, or hypoxia and generally requires hospitalization; very severe disease with central cyanosis, inability to feed, lethargy, or convulsions mandates urgent inpatient management with supportive care and parenteral therapy, consistent with WHO and IDSA/PIDS guidance and contemporary reviews of pediatric CAP severity assessment [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the etiologic patterns by age and setting before jumping to antibiotics. In children under 5 years, viruses predominate, especially RSV, rhinovirus, and metapneumovirus, with Streptococcus pneumoniae the most important bacterial pathogen when bacteria are involved; in school-aged children, Mycoplasma pneumoniae becomes more common, and mixed viral-bacterial infections are frequent, which complicates decisions about antibiotics and supports tailoring by age and local epidemiology [^113iffQj] [^116JyY9V] [^111hDweC].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antibiotics for everyone. I need to check when antibiotics are clearly indicated versus when watchful waiting is reasonable. In low-resource settings with high mortality risk, WHO continues to recommend antibiotics for all children meeting WHO pneumonia case definitions, given the inability to reliably distinguish viral from bacterial disease and the potential for rapid deterioration; in contrast, in high-income settings with good access to care and low case fatality, IDSA/PIDS advises against routine antibiotics for preschool-aged children with non-severe CAP because most cases are viral, and observational data suggest that a meaningful fraction of children diagnosed with pneumonia recover without antibiotics, though with a small increase in treatment failure when antibiotics are withheld [^117Go1ag] [^114jj6H2] [^113a3iUX] [^116nHTZ3].

> I should double-check the evidence on withholding antibiotics in non-severe, fast-breathing pneumonia. Randomized trials in LMIC settings show that placebo is inferior to short-course amoxicillin for WHO-defined non-severe pneumonia, with an absolute difference of about 3% in early treatment failure and a number needed to treat around 33, yet approximately 93% of children improved without antibiotics by day 4; this supports the WHO stance in high-burden settings while reinforcing the need to refine case definitions to avoid overtreatment of viral bronchiolitis masquerading as pneumonia [^117TXdGQ] [^113nVUEf] [^114VwXEt].

> Next, I should review first-line antibiotic choices when treatment is indicated. For otherwise healthy children older than 3 months with suspected bacterial CAP, high-dose amoxicillin is first-line because it covers S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae; for school-aged children with suspected atypical pneumonia, add a macrolide such as azithromycin or use macrolide monotherapy if Mycoplasma is strongly suspected; in hospitalized children with non-severe CAP, ampicillin or amoxicillin is appropriate, and in severe disease, broaden to a second- or third-generation cephalosporin, adding a macrolide if atypicals are a concern; for young infants 0–59 days, WHO recommends ampicillin plus gentamicin for at least 7 days given the risk of serious bacterial infection and atypical presentations [^115h6tNF] [^111sa4KA] [^114MHWSc] [^112ortQg].

> Let me consider dosing and duration carefully, and I should confirm the stewardship-aligned shorter-course data. High-dose amoxicillin at 80–90 mg/kg/day divided twice daily achieves adequate tissue concentrations for pneumococcal coverage; the CAP-IT randomized trial demonstrated that 3 days of amoxicillin was noninferior to 7 days for retreatment within 28 days, and the SAFER RCT showed 5 days of high-dose amoxicillin was comparable to 10 days for clinical cure, with meta-analyses in high-income settings confirming that 3–5 days is as effective and safe as 7–10 days; WHO continues to recommend 3–5 days for non-severe pneumonia in children 2–59 months, which aligns with both efficacy and stewardship goals [^115fvY6X] [^1119rqQt] [^113nK74W] [^113Nd7cJ] [^117Go1ag].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought that all children with chest indrawing required hospitalization and parenteral therapy; let me verify that assumption. The WHO severe pneumonia category includes chest indrawing and historically prompted referral for injectable therapy, but an equivalency trial showed that carefully selected children with severe pneumonia without hypoxia could be managed at home with high-dose oral amoxicillin with outcomes comparable to hospital parenteral ampicillin, suggesting that with reliable follow-up and safety netting, selected cases may avoid hospitalization; however, I need to ensure hypoxia is absent and social supports are in place before choosing this pathway [^11167Rep].

> I will now examine supportive care, because antibiotics alone are insufficient in moderate to severe disease. Pulse oximetry to detect hypoxemia is essential, and supplemental oxygen should be provided for SpO2 less than about 90–92% depending on local guidance; antipyretics for fever control, maintenance of hydration, and close monitoring of respiratory rate, work of breathing, and feeding tolerance are foundational; chest physiotherapy has not shown consistent benefit and is not routinely recommended outside specific contexts like bubble CPAP in hypoxemic children, so I should avoid routine physiotherapy unless part of a structured respiratory support protocol [^113sgGu8] [^114xiRu2] [^111CXVGo].

> But wait, what if the child is a young infant under 3 months. I should confirm that this group requires a lower threshold for hospitalization, broader evaluation, and parenteral therapy. Young infants have higher risks of serious bacterial infection, atypical presentations, and rapid deterioration; they undergo more laboratory testing, are hospitalized more often, and require respiratory support more frequently than older children, so empiric coverage with ampicillin plus gentamicin for at least 7 days is appropriate when pneumonia is suspected in this age group [^111p1y1s] [^112ortQg].

> Next, I should review how to assess treatment response and define failure, because this guides escalation decisions. Clinical improvement is typically expected within 48–72 hours, with reductions in fever, tachypnea, and work of breathing; persistent or worsening symptoms beyond this window should prompt reassessment for adherence, alternative diagnoses such as asthma or bronchiolitis, complications like effusion or abscess, or resistant pathogens; IDSA/PIDS recommends obtaining repeat examination, laboratory reassessment, and imaging if deterioration is suspected, and considering alternative antimicrobials or procedural management if complications are identified [^111FPYdz].

> Hold on, I should verify the approach to complications. For parapneumonic effusion or empyema, early recognition with chest ultrasound or CT, drainage when indicated, and escalation to parenteral therapy with consideration of pleural enzymes are key; for pulmonary abscess or necrotizing pneumonia, prolonged IV antibiotics and surgical consultation may be required; these decisions should be individualized based on severity, response, and local expertise [^113kzr5h].

> I need to ensure prevention is not overlooked, because vaccination is the most effective intervention to reduce pneumonia morbidity and mortality. Routine immunization with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and Hib vaccine substantially reduces bacterial pneumonia incidence, and annual influenza vaccination reduces influenza-associated bacterial coinfections; in low-resource settings, improving access to oxygen and pulse oximetry and implementing community case management further reduce deaths, and modeling suggests that scaling four core interventions to high coverage could halve predicted pneumonia deaths in high-burden countries [^115wGgd5] [^113sgGu8] [^114xiRu2].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis to ensure internal consistency. Management should be severity-based, with outpatient care and short-course high-dose amoxicillin for most non-severe cases, hospitalization and broader parenteral therapy for severe disease, and a low threshold for admission and combination therapy in very severe or high-risk children; where watchful waiting is considered, it should be in well-appearing, immunized preschoolers with reliable follow-up, acknowledging a small absolute increase in treatment failure when antibiotics are withheld; across settings, prioritize narrow-spectrum agents, the shortest effective duration, and close follow-up to balance efficacy with antimicrobial stewardship [^111kEy8f] [^114jj6H2] [^113a3iUX] [^112ahaes].

Treat pediatric pneumonia by **classifying severity** and **initiating antibiotics for bacterial or indeterminate cases** [^114tHgRs]. Use **amoxicillin first-line** for non-severe cases (3–5 days) [^117Go1ag] [^113nK74W] and add a macrolide if atypical pathogens are suspected in older children [^111sa4KA]. Hospitalize for severe disease and give IV ampicillin or ceftriaxone; add a macrolide if atypicals are suspected [^114MHWSc] [^115eg6PN]. Provide supportive care with oxygen, hydration, and antipyretics; avoid routine corticosteroids or chest physiotherapy [^116uwgSw]. Monitor for clinical deterioration and adjust therapy if there is no improvement in 48–72 hours [^111FPYdz].

---

## Clinical assessment and severity classification

Accurate clinical assessment and severity classification are essential for guiding treatment decisions. The WHO provides **clear criteria** for classifying pediatric pneumonia:

| **Severity** | **Clinical signs** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|-|
| Non-severe | - Fast breathing (≥ 50 breaths/min in children 2–12 months; ≥ 40 breaths/min in children 12–59 months) <br/> - No chest indrawing <br/> - No danger signs | Outpatient oral antibiotics |
| Severe | - Chest indrawing <br/> - No danger signs | Hospitalization if available; otherwise, outpatient care with close follow-up |
| Very severe | - Danger signs (e.g. inability to drink, convulsions, lethargy, stridor in calm child) | Immediate hospitalization and parenteral antibiotics |

---

## Antibiotic therapy

### Non-severe pneumonia

- **First-line antibiotic**: Amoxicillin is the recommended first-line antibiotic for non-severe pneumonia in children [^115h6tNF] [^117Go1ag].
- **Dosage and duration**: Amoxicillin 40–50 mg/kg per dose twice daily for 3–5 days [^117Go1ag] [^113nK74W].
- **Alternative antibiotics**: If amoxicillin is unavailable or contraindicated, co-trimoxazole or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid may be used [^117Go1ag] [^116nrWc4].

---

### Severe pneumonia

- **First-line antibiotic**: Ampicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid administered intravenously or intramuscularly [^114MHWSc].
- **Alternative antibiotics**: Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime may be used if ampicillin is unavailable or contraindicated [^114MHWSc].
- **Duration**: Typically 7–10 days, with close monitoring of clinical response [^113Nd7cJ].

---

### Very severe pneumonia

Very severe pneumonia requires **immediate hospitalization** and parenteral antibiotics. Ampicillin or penicillin plus gentamicin is recommended; if unavailable, ceftriaxone or cefotaxime are alternatives. Therapy typically lasts 10–14 days, with adjustments based on clinical response.

---

## Supportive care

Supportive care is essential in managing pediatric pneumonia. Provide **oxygen therapy** for hypoxemia (SpO2 < 90%) [^115wGgd5] and ensure adequate hydration with oral rehydration or intravenous fluids if necessary. Antipyretics such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen are used for fever control. Corticosteroids are not recommended for routine use unless there is a specific indication (e.g. adrenal insufficiency) [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring and follow-up are critical to ensure **clinical improvement** and detect complications. Reassess within **48–72 hours** to confirm clinical improvement and adherence to therapy. Define treatment failure as a lack of improvement or clinical deterioration after 48–72 hours of appropriate therapy; if failure occurs, reassess the diagnosis, consider alternative pathogens, and adjust **antibiotic therapy** accordingly [^111FPYdz].

---

## Prevention strategies

Prevention plays a significant role in reducing the incidence and severity of pediatric pneumonia. Vaccination with **pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine, and influenza vaccine** significantly reduces pneumonia incidence and severity [^notfound]. Nutritional support — ensuring adequate nutrition, including breastfeeding and supplementation with vitamin A and zinc — supports immune function and reduces pneumonia risk. Environmental health measures, such as improving indoor air quality, reducing household smoke exposure, and ensuring clean water and sanitation, further reduce pneumonia incidence.

---

## Complications and special considerations

Pediatric pneumonia can lead to **significant complications** if not adequately managed:

- **Pleural effusion and empyema**: Require drainage and prolonged antibiotic therapy [^notfound].
- **Respiratory failure**: May necessitate mechanical ventilation and intensive care.
- **Sepsis**: Requires aggressive antibiotic therapy and supportive care.

Special considerations include **antibiotic resistance**, which necessitates adherence to guidelines and antibiotic stewardship programs, and **comorbidities** such as HIV, malnutrition, and chronic lung disease, which require individualized management strategies.

---

## Recent advances and ongoing research

Recent research has focused on **short-course antibiotic therapy**, with studies demonstrating that shorter courses (3–5 days) are as effective as longer courses (7–10 days) for non-severe pneumonia [^113nK74W] [^115fvY6X]. Efforts to improve diagnostic accuracy, including rapid diagnostic tests and biomarkers, are ongoing to differentiate bacterial from viral pneumonia [^1176wMLR]. Research into novel vaccines and adjuvant therapies, such as vitamin D and zinc supplementation, continues to explore their potential roles in preventing and treating pediatric pneumonia [^115xVd6o] [^111CaDAh].

---

Effective management of pediatric pneumonia requires a **comprehensive approach** encompassing accurate clinical assessment, appropriate antibiotic therapy, supportive care, and prevention strategies. Adherence to WHO guidelines and ongoing research are essential to reduce the global burden of pediatric pneumonia and improve child health outcomes.

### Antibiotic therapy for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia: do we know when, what and for how long to treat? [^1135VCBy]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common cause of morbidity among children in developed countries and accounts for an incidence of 10–40 cases per 1000 children in the first 5 years of life. Given the clinical, social and economic importance of CAP, there is general agreement that prompt and adequate therapy is essential to reduce the impact of the disease. The aim of this discussion paper is to consider critically the available data concerning the treatment of uncomplicated pediatric CAP and to consider when, how and for how long it should be treated. This review has identified the various reasons that make it difficult to establish a rational approach to the treatment of pediatric CAP, including the definition of CAP, the absence of a pediatric CAP severity score, the difficulty of identifying the etiology, limited pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) studies, the high resistance of the most frequent respiratory pathogens to the most widely used anti-infectious agents and the lack of information concerning the changes in CAP epidemiology following the introduction of new vaccines against respiratory pathogens. More research is clearly required in various areas, such as the etiology of CAP and the reasons for its complications, the better definition of first- and second-line antibiotic therapies (including the doses and duration of parenteral and oral antibiotic treatment), the role of antiviral treatment and on how to follow-up patients with CAP. Finally, further efforts are needed to increase vaccination coverage against respiratory pathogens and to conduct prospective studies of their impact.

### Recommendations for treatment of childhood non-severe pneumonia [^117Go1ag]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2009). Medium credibility.

WHO recommendations for early antimicrobial treatment of childhood pneumonia have been effective in reducing childhood mortality, but the last major revision was over 10 years ago. The emergence of antimicrobial resistance, new pneumonia pathogens, and new drugs have prompted WHO to assemble an international panel to review the literature on childhood pneumonia and to develop evidence-based recommendations for the empirical treatment of non-severe pneumonia among children managed by first-level health providers. Treatment should target the bacterial causes most likely to lead to severe disease, including Streptoccocus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. The best first-line agent is amoxicillin, given twice daily for 3–5 days, although co-trimoxazole may be an alternative in some settings. Treatment failure should be defined in a child who develops signs warranting immediate referral or who does not have a decrease in respiratory rate after 48–72 h of therapy. If failure occurs, and no indication for immediate referral exists, possible explanations for failure should be systematically determined, including non-adherence to therapy and alternative diagnoses. If failure of the first-line agent remains a possible explanation, suitable second-line agents include high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanic acid with or without an affordable macrolide for children over 3 years of age.

### Early identification and treatment of pneumonia: a call to action [^112x99DC]. The Lancet: Global Health (2016). Medium credibility.

On the seventh World Pneumonia Day on Nov 12, 2015, we call for action to improve the early identification and treatment of childhood pneumonia at community and outpatient level to reduce deaths.

Of the estimated 5·9 million deaths in children younger than 5 years in 2015, pneumonia was one of the leading killers, causing 16% of deaths. Most of these deaths are readily preventable or treatable with proven, cost-effective interventions. Yet treatment is received by half of sick children, and only 54% with symptoms of pneumonia are taken outside the home for care. Therefore, action must be taken immediately to save children's lives by expanding services that allow early identification of symptoms and appropriate treatment.

The case–fatality rate in untreated children with pneumonia is high, sometimes reaching 20%, and death can occur as early as 3 days after illness onset. Early identification of pneumonia and appropriate treatment saves lives. By initiating antibiotic therapy soon after onset of symptoms such as fast breathing in a child with cough, the progression of a pneumonia infection is blunted. In the absence of early intervention, pneumonia progresses to a state where even intravenous antibiotics have limited impact, leading to the high hospital case–fatality rates for children. Of an estimated 15 million hospital admissions for severe and very severe pneumonia globally in 2010, 0·3 million died, approximately 19% in a hospital. Delayed care-seeking behaviour or poor access to hospital care, or both, explained the high number of severe pneumonia cases observed in hospitals.

### Childhood pneumonia in low-and-middle-income countries: an update [^113sf4xa]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Globally, pneumonia is one of the major causes of death children under the age of five years. In 2015, approximately 700,000 children younger than 5 years died from pneumonia worldwide, despite general improvement in living conditions, improved nutrition and better vaccines. Furthermore, pneumonia continues to be the leading cause of morbidity for young children outside the neonatal period, particularly in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs). Understanding the current epidemiology, and diagnostic and management strategies in these settings may improve preventive, diagnostic and treatment approaches.

The aim of this paper was to review the recent literature on (1) the epidemiology and aetiology of childhood pneumonia in LMICs; (2) diagnostic tools; and (3) prevention and management approaches.

### Antibiotic therapy versus no antibiotic therapy for children aged 2 to 59 months with WHO-defined non-severe pneumonia and wheeze [^114QGHBL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Worldwide, pneumonia is the leading cause of death amongst children under five years of age, and accounts for approximately two million deaths annually. Pneumonia can be classified according to the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Classification includes assessment of certain clinical signs and symptoms, and the severity of the disease. Treatment is then tailored according to the classification. For non-severe pneumonia, the WHO recommends treatment with oral antibiotics. We used the 2014 WHO definition of non-severe pneumonia for this review: an acute episode of cough, or difficulty in breathing, combined with fast breathing and chest indrawing. The WHO recommends treating non-severe pneumonia with oral antibiotics. Pneumonia is more commonly caused by viruses that do not require antibiotic treatment, but pneumonia caused by bacteria needs management with antibiotics to avoid complications. There is no clear way to quickly distinguish between viral and bacterial pneumonia. It is considered safe to give antibiotics, however, this may lead to the development of antibiotic resistance, and thus, limit their use in future infections. Therefore, it is essential to explore the efficacy of antibiotics for children with WHO-defined non-severe pneumonia and wheeze.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of antibiotic therapy versus no antibiotic therapy for children aged 2 to 59 months with WHO-defined non-severe pneumonia and wheeze.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, four other databases, and two trial registers (December 2020).

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of antibiotic therapy versus no antibiotic therapy for children, aged 2 to 59 months, with non-severe pneumonia and wheeze. We defined non-severe pneumonia as 'a cough or difficulty in breathing, with rapid breathing (a respiratory rate of 50 breaths per minute or more for children aged 2 to 12 months, or a respiratory rate of 40 breaths per minute or more for children aged 12 to 59 months), chest indrawing and wheeze'. We excluded trials involving children with severe or very severe pneumonia, and non-RCTs.

Data Collection and Analysis

Our primary outcomes were clinical cure and treatment failure; secondary outcomes were relapse, mortality, and treatment harms. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. Two review authors independently assessed the search results, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and the certainty of the evidence. We contacted the authors of two included trials and the author of the trial awaiting classification to obtain missing numerical outcome data.

Main Results

We included three trials involving 3256 children aged between 2 to 59 months, who exhibited features of non-severe pneumonia with wheeze. The included trials were multi-centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials carried out in Malawi, Pakistan, and India. The children were treated with a three-day course of amoxicillin or placebo, and were followed up for a total of two weeks. We assessed the included trials at overall low risk of bias for random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, attrition bias, and selective reporting. Only one trial was assessed to be at high risk for blinding of outcome assessors. One trial is awaiting classification Antibiotic therapy may result in a reduction of treatment failure by 20% (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 0.94; three trials; 3222 participants; low-certainty evidence). Antibiotic therapy probably results in little or no difference to clinical cure (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.08; one trial; 456 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and in little or no difference to relapse (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.34; three trials; 2795 participants; low-certainty evidence), and treatment harms (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.09; three trials, 3253 participants; low-certainty evidence). Two trials (2112 participants) reported on mortality; no deaths occurred in either group. One trial reported cases of hospitalisation, diarrhoea (with and without dehydration), rash (without itch), tremors, mild nausea and vomiting.

Authors' Conclusions

We do not currently have enough evidence to support or challenge the continued use of antibiotics for the treatment of non-severe pneumonia. There is a clear need for RCTs to address this question in children aged 2 to 59 months with 2014 WHO-defined non-severe pneumonia and wheeze.

### Outpatient antibiotic use and treatment failure among children with pneumonia [^116xmAuo]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

In children with pneumonia managed as outpatients, is receipt of antibiotics associated with decreased risk of treatment failure?

Findings

In this cohort study of 103 854 children with pneumonia treated in an outpatient setting, 20% did not receive antibiotics. Treatment failure was uncommon (8.7% received antibiotics and 10.7% did not receive antibiotics), and severe outcomes were rare, regardless of whether antibiotics were received (0.7% receiving antibiotics and 1.1% not receiving antibiotics).

Meaning

These findings suggest that future efforts to identify children with pneumonia who can safely be managed without antibiotics are warranted.

### Antibiotic treatment duration for community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient children in high-income countries – A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113nK74W]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

The optimal treatment duration of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children has been controversial in high-income countries. We conducted a meta-analysis to compare short antibiotic treatment (3–5 days) with longer treatment (7–10 days) among children aged ≥ 6 months.

Methods

On 31 January 2022, we searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases for studies published in English from 2003 to 2022. We included randomized controlled trials focusing on antibiotic treatment duration in children with CAP treated as outpatients. We calculated risk differences (RDs) with 95% confidence intervals and used the fixed-effect model (low heterogeneity). Our main outcome was treatment failure, defined as need for retreatment or hospitalization within 1 month. Our secondary outcome was presence of antibiotic-related harms.

Results

A total of 541 studies were screened, and 4 studies with 1541 children were included in the review. Three studies had low risk of bias, and one had some concerns. All 4 studies assessed treatment failures, and the RD was 0.1% (95% confidence interval, −3.0% to 2.0%) with high quality of evidence. Two studies (1194 children) assessed adverse events related to antibiotic treatment, and the RD was 0.0% (−5.0% to 5.0%) with moderate quality of evidence. The diagnostic criteria varied between the included studies.

Conclusions

A short antibiotic treatment duration of 3–5 days was equally effective and safe compared with the longer (current) recommendation of 7–10 days in children aged ≥ 6 months with CAP. We suggest that short antibiotic courses can be implemented in treatment of pediatric CAP.

### Community-acquired pneumonia in children [^113iffQj]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the most common cause of childhood mortality globally. In the United States, CAP is a leading cause of pediatric hospitalization and antibiotic use and is associated with substantial morbidity. There has been a dramatic shift in microbiological etiologies for CAP in children over time as pneumococcal pneumonia has become less common and viral etiologies have become predominant. There is no commonly agreed on approach to the diagnosis of CAP in children. When indicated, antimicrobial treatment should consist of narrow-spectrum antibiotics. In this article, we will describe the current understanding of the microbiological etiologies, clinical presentation, diagnostic approach, risk factors, treatment, and future directions in the diagnosis and management of pediatric CAP.

### Unsolved problems in the approach to pediatric community-acquired pneumonia [^1168J2FA]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review discusses unsolved problems concerning pediatric community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and identifies the areas of research that need to be developed.

Recent Findings

Diagnosing pediatric CAP and the required hospitalization are difficult problems especially in the presence of mild signs and symptoms. It is frequently not possible to identify the cause of this disease, and this explains why antibiotics are unnecessarily prescribed in some cases. The treatment recommendations for severe CAP are better defined than those for mild and moderate CAP.

Summary

It is possible to prepare recommendations for most of the problems that emerge in severe cases of pediatric CAP even though its cause can also be difficult to identify. However, the recommended approach to mild or moderate cases is always based on mainly moderate or poor quality evidence. There is an urgent need for further studies aimed at defining first-line and second-line antibiotic therapy for mild and moderate CAP. In the absence of new data, it is necessary to be aware that a substantial number of patients will not be optimally treated.

### Antibiotic therapy versus no antibiotic therapy for children aged two to 59 months with WHO-defined non-severe pneumonia and wheeze [^1164sxwX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Worldwide, pneumonia is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age and accounts for approximately two million deaths annually. The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed case management guidelines based on simple clinical signs to help clinicians decide on the appropriate pneumonia treatment. Children and infants who exhibit fast breathing (50 breaths per minute or more in infants two months to 12 months of age and 40 or more in children 12 months to five years of age) and cough are presumed to have non-severe pneumonia and the WHO recommends antibiotics. Implementation of these guidelines to identify and manage pneumonia at the community level has been shown to reduce acute respiratory infection (ARI)-related mortality by 36%, although apprehension exists regarding these results due to the questionable quality of evidence. As WHO guidelines do not make a distinction between viral and bacterial pneumonia, these children continue to receive antibiotics because of the concern that it may not be safe to do otherwise. Therefore, it is essential to explore the role of antibiotics in children with WHO-defined non-severe pneumonia and wheeze and to develop effective guidelines for initial antibiotic treatment.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of antibiotic therapy versus no antibiotic therapy for children aged two to 59 months with WHO-defined non-severe pneumonia and wheeze.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1946 to March week 3, 2014), EMBASE (January 2010 to March 2014), CINAHL (1981 to March 2014), LILACS (1982 to March 2014), Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (23 July 2013) and Web of Science (1985 to March 2014).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of antibiotic therapy versus no antibiotic therapy for children aged two to 59 months with non-severe pneumonia and wheeze. We considered studies that defined non-severe pneumonia as cough or difficulty in breathing with a respiratory rate above the WHO-defined age-specific values (respiratory rate of 50 breaths per minute or more for children aged two to 12 months, or a respiratory rate of 40 breaths per minute or more for children aged 12 to 59 months) and wheeze for inclusion. We have excluded non-RCTs (quasi-RCTs).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the search results and extracted data.

Main Results

We did not identify any study that completely fulfilled our inclusion criteria.

Authors' Conclusions

There is a clear need for RCTs to address this question in representative populations. We do not currently have evidence to support or challenge the continued use of antibiotics for the treatment of non-severe pneumonia, as suggested by WHO guidelines.

### Chest physiotherapy for pneumonia in children [^111CXVGo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Pneumonia is a lung infection that causes more deaths in children aged under five years than any other single cause. Chest physiotherapy is widely used as adjuvant treatment for pneumonia. Physiotherapy is thought to help remove inflammatory exudates, tracheobronchial secretions, and airway obstructions, and reduce airway resistance to improve breathing and enhance gas exchange. This is an update of a review published in 2013.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of chest physiotherapy with regard to time until clinical resolution in children (from birth to 18 years) of either gender with any type of pneumonia.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 1), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE (22 February 2018), Embase (22 February 2018), CINAHL (22 February 2018), LILACS (22 February 2018), Web of Science (22 February 2018), and PEDro (22 February 2018). We also searched clinical trials registers (ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP) to identify planned, ongoing, and unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared any type of chest physiotherapy with no chest physiotherapy for children with pneumonia.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. The primary outcomes of interest were mortality, duration of hospital stay, and time to clinical resolution. We used Review Manager 5 software to analyse data and GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included three new RCTs for this update, for a total of six included RCTs involving 559 children aged from 29 days to 12 years with pneumonia who were treated as inpatients. Pneumonia severity was described as moderate in one trial, severe in two trials, and was not stated in three trials. The studies assessed five different interventions: effects of conventional chest physiotherapy (3 studies, 211 children), positive expiratory pressure (1 study, 72 children), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (1 study, 94 children), bubble CPAP (bCPAP) (1 study, 225 children), and assisted autogenic drainage (1 studies, 29 children). The included studies were conducted in Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Egypt, and South Africa. The studies were overall at low risk of bias. Blinding of participants was not possible in most studies, but we considered that the outcomes were unlikely to be influenced by the lack of blinding. All included studies evaluated mortality. However, three studies assessed mortality as an outcome, and only one study of bCPAP reported that deaths occurred. Three deaths occurred in children in the physiotherapy group (N = 79) and 20 deaths in children in the control group (N = 146) (risk ratio (RR) 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 0.90; 559 children; low-quality evidence). It is uncertain whether chest physiotherapy techniques (bCPAP, assisted autogenic drainage, and conventional chest physiotherapy) reduced hospital stay duration (days) (mean difference (MD) 0.10, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.76; 4 studies; low-quality evidence). There was variation among clinical parameters used to define clinical resolution. Two small studies found no difference in resolution of fever between children in the physiotherapy (conventional chest physiotherapy and assisted autogenic drainage) and control groups. Of five studies that considered peripheral oxygen saturation levels, only two reported that use of chest physiotherapy (CPAP and conventional chest physiotherapy) showed a greater improvement in peripheral oxygen saturation levels. However, it was unclear whether respiratory rate (breaths/min) improved after conventional chest physiotherapy (MD -2.25, 95% CI -5.17 to 0.68; 2 studies, 122 children; low-quality evidence). Two studies assessed adverse events (number of events), but only one study reported any events (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.67; 2 studies, 254 children; low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

We could draw no reliable conclusions concerning the use of chest physiotherapy for children with pneumonia due to the small number of included trials with differing study characteristics and statistical presentation of data. Future studies should consider the following key points: appropriate sample size with adequate power to detect expected differences, standardisation of chest physiotherapy techniques, appropriate outcomes (such as duration of leukocytosis, and airway clearance), and adverse effects.

### Impact of Infectious Diseases Society of America / Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society guidelines on treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in hospitalized children [^117AoCG9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

We examined the impact of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines that recommend ampicillin or amoxicillin for children hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia. Prescribing of ampicillin/amoxicillin increased following guideline publication, but remains low. Cephalosporin and macrolide prescribing decreased but remains common. Further studies exploring outcomes of and reasons for compliance with guidelines are warranted.

### Childhood pneumonia in developing countries [^114zDXCV]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia is a widespread and common infectious lung disease that causes inflammation, which can lead to reduced oxygenation, shortness of breath, and death. An estimated nearly 1.2 million children younger than 5 years died in 2011 from pneumonia. Most of these deaths occured in developing countries where access to care is limited and interventions that have improved care in developed countries are scarce. Despite substantial increases in our understanding of the clinical syndrome of pneumonia and its aetiologies, its accurate diagnosis is challenging when clinical indicators are relied on, and improves only modestly with addition of laboratory, microbiological, or radiographical tests. Prevention programmes and treatment guidelines have led to impressive reductions in disease, but children remain at risk of misdiagnosis and inadequate treatment. Research to address challenges in the aetiological diagnosis of pneumonia and widespread implementation of treatment interventions beyond vaccines and antibiotics are necessary to mitigate the burden of pneumonia and improve child survival.

### Efficacy of antibiotic regimens for pneumonia in young infants aged 0–59 days: a systematic review [^114iriJZ]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study Design

The protocol for this systematic review was prospectively registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023417564). Our population, intervention, comparator, outcome question was: Among young infants aged 0 to 59 days with pneumonia (population), do antibiotic regimens for the treatment of pneumonia (intervention) compared with alternate antibiotic regimens or alternate management such as observation, referral, or placebo (comparator) improve critical outcomes (outcome)?

This systematic review was commissioned by the WHO to inform guidelines regarding treatment of young infant pneumonia.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, the WHO Global Index Medicus, and the Cochrane Central Registry of Trials. All databases were searched from inception to April 19, 2023. The full search strategy is available in Supplemental Appendix 1. We also hand-searched key reviews and systematic reviews related to young infant pneumonia to identify additional studies that met our inclusion criteria.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

We included published RCTs, individual or cluster randomized, for which a full-text manuscript was available that reported the results of trials comparing antibiotic efficacy for pneumonia among young infants aged 0 to 59 days. We excluded unpublished gray literature, nonrandomized, and pharmacokinetic studies. We applied no limitations on the basis of language or publication date.

Study Setting

We did not limit inclusion on the basis of the study setting. Enrollment and treatment could occur in any location including the home, health center, outpatient health facility, or hospital. We define nonhospital-based trials as those in which infants received their antibiotic treatment in any setting not self-identified as a hospital facility, including a health center, health post, or the home. We define hospital-based trials as those in which infants received their antibiotic treatment while inpatient in a hospital, as defined by the study investigators.

Participants

We included RCTs of infants aged 0 to 59 days postnatal age who were diagnosed with pneumonia. Studies enrolling infants over 60 days were included only if:

1. there was a subgroup analysis presenting outcomes among infants aged 0 to 59 days; or

2. the mean postnatal age in days plus 1 SD above the mean was less than 60 days.

### Outpatient antibiotic use and treatment failure among children with pneumonia [^116nHTZ3]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Pneumonia is diagnosed during 1.5 million ambulatory care visits each year among children in the US. Because viral pathogens can be detected in most cases, especially in younger children, guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend that preschool-aged children with pneumonia who are well enough to be treated in an outpatient setting do not routinely require antibiotic treatment. However, in practice, antibiotics are prescribed for most children, likely because of concerns about bacterial coinfection and lack of published evidence to guide a decision not to prescribe antibiotics. Treating children with antibiotics when they are unlikely to provide benefit contributes to antibiotic resistance and exposes children to potential risks, including rash, diarrhea, mislabeling of allergy, and, rarely, severe complications.

In children outside of the US with nonsevere, so-called fast-breathing pneumonia as defined by the World Health Organization, randomized clinical trials have shown only modest effects of amoxicillin compared with placebo. One study of 337 children with pneumonia and other lower respiratory tract infections discharged from a single emergency department (ED) in the USfound no association of antibiotics with treatment failure. However, no large-scale studies in the US have compared clinical outcomes between children diagnosed with pneumonia in an outpatient setting who were treated with and without antibiotics.

The objectives of this study were to identify the frequency with which children diagnosed with pneumonia in outpatient settings do not receive antibiotics and to compare the risk of treatment failure and severe outcomes between children who receive antibiotics and those who do not. A clearer understanding of the natural history of untreated pneumonia and the comparative effectiveness of antibiotic treatment for pneumonia may inform future studies that identify which children with nonsevere pneumonia can be managed safely without antibiotics.

### Interpretation of antibiotic trials in pediatric pneumonia [^114d6QBH]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Recent randomized clinical trials have compared antibiotic regimens of varying intensity for the treatment of pediatric community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). These trials identified no advantage to high-dose vs low-dose amoxicillinor a longer vs shorter duration of antibiotic therapy, with respect to rates or timing of clinical improvement. However, most of these trials enrolled children based solely on clinical criteria or clinician judgment. Given the challenges of diagnosing pediatric pneumonia clinically, it is likely that most children included in studies with clinically suspected CAP did not have radiographic pneumonia and thus would have improved regardless of antibiotic therapy.

### Community-acquired pneumonia in children-a changing spectrum of disease [^112DYQzh]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pneumonia has been the leading cause of death in children younger than 5 years for decades. Although there have been substantial decreases in overall child mortality and in pneumonia-specific mortality, pneumonia remains the major single cause of death in children outside the neonatal period, causing approximately 900,000 of the estimated 6.3 million child deaths in 2013. Substantial advances have occurred in the understanding of risk factors and etiology of pneumonia, in development of standardized case definitions, and in prevention with the production of improved vaccines and in treatment. Such advances have led to changes in the epidemiology, etiology and mortality from childhood pneumonia. However in many areas access to these interventions remains sub-optimal, with large inequities between and within countries and regions. In this paper we review the impact of recent preventative and management advances in pneumonia epidemiology, etiology, radiologic presentation and outcome in children.

### Developing consensus on clinical outcomes for children with mild pneumonia: a Delphi study [^115yA1cX]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The absence of consensus for outcomes in pediatric antibiotic trials is a major barrier to research harmonization and clinical translation. We sought to develop expert consensus on study outcomes for clinical trials of children with mild community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

Methods

Applying the Delphi method, a multispecialty expert panel ranked the importance of various components of clinical response and treatment failure outcomes in children with mild CAP for use in research. During Round 1, panelists suggested additional outcomes in open-ended responses that were added to subsequent rounds of consensus building. For Rounds 2 and 3, panelists were provided their own prior responses and summary statistics for each item in the previous round. The consensus was defined by > 70% agreement.

Results

The expert panel determined that response to and failure of treatment should be addressed at a median of 3 days after initiation. Complete or substantial improvement in fever, work of breathing, dyspnea, tachypnea when afebrile, oral intake, and activity should be included as components of adequate clinical response outcomes. Clinical signs and symptoms including persistent or worsening fever, work of breathing, and reduced oral intake should be included in treatment failure outcomes. Interventions including receipt of parenteral fluids, supplemental oxygen, need for high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy, and change in prescription of antibiotics should also be considered in treatment failure outcomes.

Conclusions

Clinical response and treatment failure outcomes determined by the consensus of this multidisciplinary expert panel can be used for pediatric CAP studies to provide objective data translatable to clinical practice.

### Review of treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia [^111wTGxs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a costly disease that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The growing prevalence of this disease has resulted in various advances in diagnosis and treatment. The most common pathogens of CAP include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and atypical pathogens; however, the underlying pathogen often is unknown. Treatment of CAP has evolved because of changing etiologic patterns and increasing antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens. Among the groups that have established treatment guidelines for CAP are the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These guidelines establish risk factors associated with drug resistance or infection with specific pathogens. In addition, each guideline provides unique recommendations that are similar in some ways, yet different in others. By understanding the various risk factors for drug resistance and the treatment options endorsed by these guidelines, physicians can treat patients with the most appropriate antimicrobial available.

### Childhood community-acquired pneumonia: a review of etiology-and antimicrobial treatment studies [^115CpSnP]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of childhood morbidity worldwide. Because of the rising antimicrobial resistance rates and adverse effects of childhood antibiotic use on the developing microbiome, rational prescribing of antibiotics for CAP is important. This review summarizes and critically reflects on the available evidence for the epidemiology, etiology and antimicrobial management of childhood CAP. Larger prospective studies on antimicrobial management derive mostly from low- or middle-income countries as they have the highest burden of CAP. Optimal antimicrobial management depends on the etiology, age, local vaccination policies and resistance patterns. As long as non-rapid surrogate markers are used to distinguish viral- from bacterial pneumonia, the management is probably suboptimal. For a young child with signs of non-severe pneumonia (with or without wheezing), watchful waiting is recommended because of probable viral etiology. For children with more severe CAP with fever, a five-day oral amoxicillin course would be the first choice therapy and dosage will depend on local resistance rates. There is no clear evidence yet for superiority of a macrolide-based regimen for all ages. For cases with CAP requiring hospitalization, several studies have shown that narrow-spectrum IV beta-lactam therapy is as effective as a broad-spectrum cephalosporin therapy. For most severe disease, broad-spectrum therapy with or without a macrolide is suggested. In case of empyema, rapid IV-to-oral switch seems to be equivalent to prolonged IV treatment.

### Unique considerations in the evaluation of antibacterials in clinical trials for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia [^113EYeqR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

There are few placebo-controlled, randomized, prospective clinical trials of antibiotic therapy for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children. The reduction in mortality seen in early trials of antibacterials for treatment of bacterial CAP in adults and children was dramatic and led to the adoption of antibacterial therapy as the standard of care for CAP in both adults and children. Because of the efficacy of antibacterials for treatment of CAP in adults and the reluctance of society to place children at risk of adverse outcomes in placebo-controlled clinical trials, pediatric investigations of this type were not performed after 1940. Instead, comparative trials were subsequently conducted and reported. More recently, comparative trials using a noninferiority trial design have been used by regulatory agencies to grant approval of antibiotic therapy for pediatric CAP. We cannot reliably distinguish between pneumonia cases caused by bacterial, viral, or atypical pathogens among the relatively homogeneous population of children with CAP who are enrolled into clinical trials. Patient- or parent-reported outcomes represent an option for appropriate, defined clinical trial outcomes for pediatric CAP, because the disease in children has a relatively short and potentially self-resolving clinical course. Clinical trials that require invasive techniques for diagnosis and placebo-controlled randomized trials are not acceptable for children, who are considered to be a vulnerable population.

### Antibiotic treatment duration for community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient children in high-income countries – A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Nd7cJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) affects 0.3%–1.5% of children yearly in Western countries. The current standard treatment strategy in international guidelines for CAP is 7–10 days of oral amoxicillin, regardless of etiology. In children < 5 years of age, viruses alone or in mixed infections with bacteria are the most common cause of CAP. Evidence shows that Mycoplasma pneumoniae is involved in more than half of the cases after 10 years of age, but the usefulness of antibiotics remains obscure. At all ages the most important bacterial pathogen is Streptococcus pneumoniae. Complications are rare, but when they are present, they usually follow pneumococcal CAP.

The optimal treatment duration for CAP in high-income countries has been controversial. A systematic review published in 2014, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs), addressed the efficacy of the shorter treatment duration for CAP. Only 1 of the 8 RCTs was from a high-income country and most of the RCTs did not compare shorter antibiotic treatment with the current treatment recommendation. The most recent systematic review without meta-analysis included 11 trials (of which 8 were from developing countries) and concluded that more studies from high-income countries were needed to determine the safety and effectiveness of shorter antibiotic treatment in children.

Shorter antibiotic treatments for pediatric CAP cases have, at least in theory, several potential benefits over current treatment strategies. Shorter courses may prevent development of antibiotic resistance by minimizing exposure of both pathogenic and nonpathogenic microbes of normal flora to antibiotics, which diminishes the selection pressure for emergence of resistant strains. In addition, unnecessary long courses increase the risk of adverse events, such as diarrhea, which is common in young children treated with antibiotics.

This meta-analysis comprising RCTs focused on antibiotic treatment duration of CAP in children treated as outpatients in high-income countries. Our primary aim was to determine whether a short antibiotic treatment duration of 3–5 days was as effective and safe as the longer treatment duration of 7–10 days. In addition, we evaluated antibiotic-related adverse events as a secondary objective of the study.

### Community-acquired pneumonia in children [^111hDweC]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common respiratory infection in children, with viral etiologies predominating. Bacterial pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae also contribute significantly. Diagnosis relies primarily on clinical findings, with imaging reserved for severe cases. Treatment depends on the etiology, with amoxicillin as the first-line antibiotic for bacterial CAP and macrolides for atypical pneumonia. Supportive care, including oxygen therapy, is crucial for severe cases. Vaccination has drastically reduced CAP-related mortality, but new epidemiologic trends necessitate continued research. This review provides an updated approach to diagnosing, managing, and preventing pediatric CAP.

### Vitamin D as an adjunct to antibiotics for the treatment of acute childhood pneumonia [^115xVd6o]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Children with acute pneumonia may be vitamin D deficient. Clinical trials have found that prophylactic vitamin D supplementation decreases children's risk of developing pneumonia. Data on the therapeutic effects of vitamin D in acute childhood pneumonia are limited. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2018.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of vitamin D supplementation as an adjunct to antibiotics for the treatment of acute childhood pneumonia.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trial registries on 28 December 2021. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared vitamin D supplementation with placebo in children (aged one month to five years) hospitalised with acute community-acquired pneumonia, as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) acute respiratory infection guidelines. For this update, we reappraised eligible trials according to research integrity criteria, excluding RCTs published from April 2018 that were not prospectively registered in a trials registry according to WHO or Clinical Trials Registry - India (CTRI) guidelines (it was not mandatory to register clinical trials in India before April 2018).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. For dichotomous data, we extracted the number of participants experiencing the outcome and the total number of participants in each treatment group. For continuous data, we used the arithmetic mean and standard deviation (SD) for each treatment group together with number of participants in each group. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

In this update, we included three new trials involving 468 children, bringing the total number of trials to seven, with 1601 children (631 with pneumonia and 970 with severe or very severe pneumonia). We categorised three previously included studies and three new studies as 'awaiting classification' based on the research integrity screen. Five trials used a single bolus dose of vitamin D (300,000 IU in one trial and 100,000 IU in four trials) at the onset of illness or within 24 hours of hospital admission; one used a daily dose of oral vitamin D (1000 IU for children aged up to one year and 2000 IU for children aged over one year) for five days; and one used variable doses (on day 1, 20,000 IU in children younger than six months, 50,000 IU in children aged six to 12 months, and 100,000 IU in children aged 13 to 59 months; followed by 10,000 IU/day for four days or until discharge). Three trials performed microbiological diagnosis of pneumonia, radiological diagnosis of pneumonia, or both. Vitamin D probably has little or no effect on the time to resolution of acute illness (mean difference (MD) -1.28 hours, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.47 to 2.91; 5 trials, 1188 children; moderate-certainty evidence). We do not know if vitamin D has an effect on the duration of hospitalisation (MD 4.96 hours, 95% CI -8.28 to 18.21; 5 trials, 1023 children; very low-certainty evidence). We do not know if vitamin D has an effect on mortality rate (risk ratio (RR) 0.69, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.07; 3 trials, 584 children; low-certainty evidence). The trials reported no major adverse events. According to GRADE criteria, the evidence was of very low-to-moderate certainty for all outcomes, owing to serious trial limitations, inconsistency, indirectness, and imprecision. Three trials received funding: one from the New Zealand Aid Corporation, one from an institutional grant, and one from multigovernment organisations (Bangladesh, Sweden, and UK). The remaining four trials were unfunded.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on the available evidence, we are uncertain whether vitamin D supplementation has important effects on outcomes of acute pneumonia when used as an adjunct to antibiotics. The trials reported no major adverse events. Uncertainty in the evidence is due to imprecision, risk of bias, inconsistency, and indirectness.

### Antibiotics in childhood pneumonia [^1158qBEX]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Pneumonia is one of the most common global childhood illnesses. The diagnosis relies on a combination of clinical judgement and radiological and laboratory investigations. Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most important cause of childhood community-acquired pneumonia. In addition, viruses (including respiratory syncytial virus) and atypical bacteria (Mycoplasma and Chlamydia) are likely pathogens in younger and older children in developed countries. In the minority of cases only, the actual organism is isolated to guide treatment. Antibiotics effective against the expected bacterial pathogens should be instituted where necessary. The route and duration of antibiotic therapy, the role of emerging pathogens and the impact of pneumococcal resistance and conjugate pneumococcal vaccines are also discussed.

### Short-course antimicrobial therapy for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia: the SAFER randomized clinical trial [^1119rqQt]. JAMA Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common occurrence in childhood; consequently, evidence-based recommendations for its treatment are required.

Objective

To determine whether 5 days of high-dose amoxicillin for CAP was associated with noninferior rates of clinical cure compared with 10 days of high-dose amoxicillin.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The SAFER (Short-Course Antimicrobial Therapy for Pediatric Respiratory Infections) study was a 2-center, parallel-group, noninferiority randomized clinical trial consisting of a single-center pilot study from December 1, 2012, to March 31, 2014, and the follow-up main study from August 1, 2016, to December 31, 2019 at the emergency departments of McMaster Children's Hospital and the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario. Research staff, participants, and outcome assessors were blinded to treatment allocation. Eligible children were aged 6 months to 10 years and had fever within 48 hours, respiratory symptoms, chest radiography findings consistent with pneumonia as per the emergency department physician, and a primary diagnosis of pneumonia. Children were excluded if they required hospitalization, had comorbidities that would predispose them to severe disease and/or pneumonia of unusual origin, or had previous β-lactam antibiotic therapy. Data were analyzed from March 1 to July 8, 2020.

Interventions

Five days of high-dose amoxicillin therapy followed by 5 days of placebo (intervention group) vs 5 days of high-dose amoxicillin followed by a different formulation of 5 days of high-dose amoxicillin (control group).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Clinical cure at 14 to 21 days.

Results

Among the 281 participants, the median age was 2.6 (interquartile range, 1.6–4.9) years (160 boys [57.7%] of 279 with sex listed). Clinical cure was observed in 101 of 114 children (88.6%) in the intervention group and in 99 of 109 (90.8%) in the control group in per-protocol analysis (risk difference, -0.016; 97.5% confidence limit, -0.087). Clinical cure at 14 to 21 days was observed in 108 of 126 (85.7%) in the intervention group and in 106 of 126 (84.1%) in the control group in the intention-to-treat analysis (risk difference, 0.023; 97.5% confidence limit, -0.061).

Conclusions and Relevance

Short-course antibiotic therapy appeared to be comparable to standard care for the treatment of previously healthy children with CAP not requiring hospitalization. Clinical practice guidelines should consider recommending 5 days of amoxicillin for pediatric pneumonia management in accordance with antimicrobial stewardship principles.

### Approach to common bacterial infections: community-acquired pneumonia [^114LjwMv]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) occurs more often in early childhood than at almost any other age. Many microorganisms are associated with pneumonia, but individual pathogens are difficult to identify, which poses problems in antibiotic management. This article reviews the common as well as new, emerging pathogens, as well as the guidelines for management of pediatric CAP. Current guidelines for pediatric CAP continue to recommend the use of high-dose amoxicillin for bacterial CAP and azithromycin for suspected atypical CAP (usually caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae) in children.

### Community-acquired pneumonia in children-a changing spectrum of disease [^114tHgRs]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Management — recent advances

Case management of pneumonia is a strategy by which severity of disease is classified as severe or non-severe. All children receive early, appropriate oral antibiotics, and severe cases are referred for parenteral antibiotics. When implemented in high-burden areas before the availability of conjugate vaccines, case management as part of Integrated Management of Childhood Illness was associated with a 27% decrease in overall child mortality, and 42% decrease in pneumonia-specific mortality. However the predominance of viral causes of pneumonia and low case fatality have prompted concern about overuse of antibiotics. Several randomized controlled trials comparing oral antibiotics to placebo for non-severe pneumonia have been performed and others are ongoing. In two studies, performed in Denmark and in India, outcomes of antibiotic and placebo treatments were equivalent. In the third study, in Pakistan, there was a non-significant 24% vs. 20% rate of failure in the placebo group, which was deemed to be non-equivalent to the antibiotic group. Furthermore, because WHO-classified non-severe pneumonia and bronchiolitis might be considered within a spectrum of lower respiratory disease, many children with clinical pneumonia could actually have viral bronchiolitis, for which antibiotics are not beneficial. This has been reflected in British and Spanish national pneumonia guidelines, which do not recommend routine antibiotic treatment for children younger than 2 years with evidence of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination who present with non-severe pneumonia. The United States' national guidelines recommend withholding antibiotics in children up to age 5 years presenting with non-severe pneumonia. However, given the high mortality from pneumonia in low- and middle-income countries, the lack of easy access to care, and the high prevalence of risk factors for severe disease, revised World Health Organization pneumonia guidelines still recommend antibiotic treatment for all children who meet the WHO pneumonia case definitions.

Use of supplemental oxygen is life-saving, but this is not universally available in low- and middle-income countries; it is estimated that use of supplemental oxygen systems could reduce mortality of children with hypoxic pneumonia by 20%. Identifying systems capacity to increase availability of oxygen in health facilities, and identifying barriers to further implementation are among the top 15 priorities for future childhood pneumonia research. However, up to 81% of pneumonia deaths in 2010 occurred outside health facilities, so there are major challenges with access to health services and health-seeking behavior of vulnerable populations. Identifying and changing the barriers to accessing health care is an important area with the potential to impact the survival and health of the most vulnerable children.

### The management of community-acquired pneumonia in infants and children older than 3 months of age: clinical practice guidelines by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115dub8i]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, antiviral therapy, IDSA/PIDS 2011 guidelines recommend to do not delay antiviral therapy until confirmation of positive influenza test results. Do not exclude influenza disease conclusively in case of negative results of influenza diagnostic tests, especially rapid antigen tests. Consider initiating treatment after 48 hours of symptomatic infection in patients with more severe disease, as it may still provide clinical benefit.

### Efficacy of zinc as adjunctive pneumonia treatment in children aged 2 to 60 months in low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111CaDAh]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2020). High credibility.

However, the role of adjunctive zinc at presentation in pneumonia is still controversial: meta-analyses published in 2011, 2012 and 2016found no effect, while another published in 2018 estimated a significant reduction in mortality (risk ratio 0.43, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.83), but no difference in composite treatment failure rates. The last study was published in 2018 and included studies up to October 2015, 4 years before our search. In addition, this meta-analysis included only studies of severe pneumonia at randomisation. These represent a minority of all pneumonia cases and the public health implications of even a small gain in non-severe pneumonia would be considerable.

As this area of research remains active with new findings published since the last meta-analysis, we aimed to update the evidence for the efficacy of adjunctive zinc treatment in all pneumonia in children in LMICs.

### Placebo vs amoxicillin for nonsevere fast-breathing pneumonia in Malawian children aged 2 to 59 months: a double-blind, randomized clinical noninferiority trial [^113nVUEf]. JAMA Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are antibiotics necessary for the treatment of nonsevere fast-breathing pneumonia in children?

Findings

In this double-blind, randomized clinical noninferiority trial that included 1126 HIV-uninfected children aged 2 to 59 months in a malaria-endemic region of Malawi, Africa, placebo treatment of nonsevere fast-breathing pneumonia was significantly inferior to 3 days of amoxicillin treatment with respect to treatment failure at day 4. Fast-breathing pneumonia resolved by day 4 in 93% of children without the use of the antibiotic.

Meaning

Without amoxicillin treatment, 7% of Malawian children with nonsevere fast-breathing pneumonia failed treatment by day 4, and treating 33 children with amoxicillin was necessary for 1 child to benefit.

### Early identification and treatment of pneumonia: a call to action [^1165Nxp2]. The Lancet: Global Health (2016). Medium credibility.

Clinical trials show that children with fast-breathing pneumonia can be effectively treated with oral antibiotics. As a result, many low-income and middle-income countries have now adopted policies for community case management of sick children in underserved communities, as recommended by WHO and UNICEF. Evidence shows that when children are treated in accordance with these standard case management guidelines at health facilities or by community health workers (CHWs), children are treated promptly, antibiotics are used more appropriately, and mortality is reduced. Recently, WHO released new guidelines for treatment of lower chest indrawing pneumonia with oral amoxicillin on an outpatient basis. The rationale for introducing the new guidelines was not only because they are likely to reduce societal costs (due to less hospitalisation), but because they deliver better outcomes.

The WHO pneumonia management guideline is presumptive, based on identification of clinical signs in children with cough or difficult breathing and on treatment with antibiotics. Some argue that CHWs have insufficient capacity to correctly manage pneumoniaand that the evidence of efficacy of antibiotic treatment for fast-breathing pneumonia is questionable, especially when wheeze is present. However, CHWs who have appropriate training, adequate supervision, and availability of drugs and necessary supplies have shown ability to provide quality care for pneumonia. Although wheeze is more common in viral infections and often responds well to bronchodilators, a placebo-controlled double blind trial showed higher clinical treatment failure in children with fast-breathing pneumonia and wheeze who received placebo compared to antibiotic. Mixed viral and bacterial infections are common, yet efforts to identify other clinical features to better diagnose bacterial pneumonia have not succeeded. Since it is still impossible to clinically differentiate viral from bacterial pneumonia, prompt treatment of clinical pneumonia with antibiotics will remain a priority for the foreseeable future.

Regarding specific circumstances for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, antibiotic therapy, outpatient regimens, BTS 2011 guidelines recommend to do not use antibiotics in < 2 years old pediatric patients presenting with mild symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection, as they do not usually have pneumonia, but review if symptoms persist. Use a history of conjugate pneumococcal vaccination as a factor to support this decision.

### World pneumonia day 2024: fighting pneumonia and antimicrobial resistance [^115wGgd5]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic highlighted our vulnerabilities in the management of pneumonia and our low level of preparedness for pandemic situations worldwide and drew attention to the impact of respiratory infections, the importance of early diagnosis and initiation of therapy, the vital role of oxygen in this global emergency, and the worldwide healthcare inequities. However, the scientific community also demonstrated its ability to respond to an emergency of this scale by developing new vaccines, rapid diagnostic tests, and clinical treatments in record time.

Two questions regarding the impact of pneumonia remain unanswered: first, why does pneumonia, a treatable and preventable disease, still have such a huge impact on global health? And second, how is it possible that pneumococcus was involved in 16% of the deaths attributable to AMR when we have effective pneumococcal vaccines? Maybe the answer to these questions is to be found in an article published in 2022 that focused on the shortcomings in child pneumonia research. The authors identified 20 research priorities in child pneumonia, the most important one being "to explore interventions to prevent neonatal pneumonia", reflecting the concern with the mortality due to the condition in newborns, as 47% of deaths in children 5 years of age or younger occur in this group. Similarly, new research finds that increasing the application of four pneumonia interventions (vaccination against Haemophilus influenzae B, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [PCV], treatment with oral antibiotics, and targeted oxygen treatment of hypoxemia) to reach ≥ 90% by 2030 could prevent half of the predicted deaths from pneumonia in children 5 years old or younger in Chad, Ethiopia, and Bangladesh, the countries with the highest rates of child mortality.

In fact, the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance network, a collaborative platform that conducts standardized, comprehensive, and high-quality surveillance of causes of child mortality in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, reported that, in these high-mortality settings, infectious diseases continue to cause the most deaths in infants and children, often in conjunction with malnutrition. That study identified lower respiratory tract infections as the most common overall cause of death, occurring in almost half of all fatalities. The finding that pathogens such as S. pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and H. influenzae had an important impact as causes of infections demonstrated the gaps that still exist. Efforts to ensure that pneumonia vaccines achieve optimal coverage and avoid unjustified deaths are needed, despite the fact that the 2023 World Health Organization/UNICEF Estimates of National Immunization Coverage report showed that more children are being immunized than ever before.

### A randomized controlled trial of zinc as adjuvant therapy for severe pneumonia in young children [^1112BM78]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Diarrhea and pneumonia are the leading causes of illness and death in children < 5 years of age. Zinc supplementation is effective for treatment of acute diarrhea and can prevent pneumonia. In this trial, we measured the efficacy of zinc when given to children hospitalized and treated with antibiotics for severe pneumonia.

Methods

We enrolled 610 children aged 2 to 35 months who presented with severe pneumonia defined by the World Health Organization as cough and/or difficult breathing combined with lower chest indrawing. All children received standard antibiotic treatment and were randomized to receive zinc (10 mg in 2- to 11-month-olds and 20 mg in older children) or placebo daily for up to 14 days. The primary outcome was time to cessation of severe pneumonia.

Results

Zinc recipients recovered marginally faster, but this difference was not statistically significant (hazard ratio = 1.10, 95% CI 0.94–1.30). Similarly, the risk of treatment failure was slightly but not significantly lower in those who received zinc (risk ratio = 0.88 95% CI 0.71–1.10).

Conclusions

Adjunct treatment with zinc reduced the time to cessation of severe pneumonia and the risk of treatment failure only marginally, if at all, in hospitalized children.

### Guideline-concordant antibiotic use in children with community-acquired pneumonia [^1159syQE]. Hospital Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite national guidelines on appropriate antibiotic therapy, there is wide variation in antibiotic decision-making for children with community-acquired pneumonia. This study sought to determine prevalence and factors associated with guideline-concordant antibiotic use in children presenting with pneumonia to the emergency department (ED).

Methods

We enrolled children aged younger than 18 years presenting to the ED at 2 US children's hospitals between September 2017 and May 2019 with clinical and radiographic pneumonia. The primary outcome was guideline-concordant antibiotic use as defined by the 2011 Infectious Diseases Society of America pediatric pneumonia guideline and local expert consensus. Outcomes included proportion of antibiotic use and proportion of guideline-concordant treatment. We used multivariable logistic regression models to determine associations of comorbidities and functional limitations, clinical findings, and radiographic characteristics with overall antibiotic use and guideline-concordant treatment.

Results

Among 772 included children, 573 received antibiotics (74.2%), and 441 (57.1%) received guideline-concordant antibiotic treatment. Antibiotic initiation was less likely in those with interstitial findings on chest radiograph (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.14; 95% CI, 0.07–0.25) and negative results or nonperformance of viral testing (aOR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.24–0.65). Guideline-concordant treatment was more likely in those with chest indrawing (aOR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.34–3.66) and less likely in those with clinically significant effusion (aOR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.06–0.76).

Conclusions

Among children presenting to the ED with pneumonia, more than 40% received treatment inconsistent with guideline recommendations. These observations underscore opportunities to improve appropriate antibiotic use in this population.

### Prevalence of clinical signs within reference ranges among hospitalized patients prescribed antibiotics for pneumonia [^112iEELC]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the prevalence of antibiotic therapy for possible pneumonia in hospitalized patients despite clinical signs within the reference range?

Findings

In this cohort study of 12 273 patients treated for possible pneumonia in 4 hospitals, all cardinal signs for pneumonia were within reference ranges in 18.6% of patients with possible community-acquired pneumonia and 13.5% of patients with possible hospital-acquired pneumonia. Antibiotics were continued for 3 days or longer after all clinical signs were normal in 34.8% of patients treated for community-acquired pneumonia and 38.4% treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia.

Meaning

Findings of this study suggest that antibiotics are prescribed frequently for suspected pneumonia in patients with clinical signs within reference ranges and continued for 3 days or longer after clinical signs normalize; these findings suggest potential targets to improve prescribing.

### Effect of amoxicillin dose and treatment duration on the need for antibiotic Re-treatment in children with community-acquired pneumonia: the CAP-IT randomized clinical trial [^115fvY6X]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The optimal dose and duration of oral amoxicillin for children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are unclear.

Objective

To determine whether lower-dose amoxicillin is noninferior to higher dose and whether 3-day treatment is noninferior to 7 days.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Multicenter, randomized, 2×2 factorial noninferiority trial enrolling 824 children, aged 6 months and older, with clinically diagnosed CAP, treated with amoxicillin on discharge from emergency departments and inpatient wards of 28 hospitals in the UK and 1 in Ireland between February 2017 and April 2019, with last trial visit on May 21, 2019.

Interventions

Children were randomized 1:1 to receive oral amoxicillin at a lower dose (35–50 mg/kg/d; n = 410) or higher dose (70–90 mg/kg/d; n = 404), for a shorter duration (3 days; n = 413) or a longer duration (7 days; n = 401).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was clinically indicated antibiotic re-treatment for respiratory infection within 28 days after randomization. The noninferiority margin was 8%. Secondary outcomes included severity/duration of 9 parent-reported CAP symptoms, 3 antibiotic-related adverse events, and phenotypic resistance in colonizing Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates.

Results

Of 824 participants randomized into 1 of the 4 groups, 814 received at least 1 dose of trial medication (median [IQR] age, 2.5 years [1.6–2.7]; 421 [52%] males and 393 [48%] females), and the primary outcome was available for 789 (97%). For lower vs higher dose, the primary outcome occurred in 12.6% with lower dose vs 12.4% with higher dose (difference, 0.2% [1-sided 95% CI -∞ to 4.0%]), and in 12.5% with 3-day treatment vs 12.5% with 7-day treatment (difference, 0.1% [1-sided 95% CI -∞ to 3.9]). Both groups demonstrated noninferiority with no significant interaction between dose and duration (P = 0.63). Of the 14 prespecified secondary end points, the only significant differences were 3-day vs 7-day treatment for cough duration (median 12 days vs 10 days; hazard ratio [HR], 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0 to 1.4]; p = 0.04) and sleep disturbed by cough (median, 4 days vs 4 days; HR, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0 to 1.4]; p = 0.03). Among the subgroup of children with severe CAP, the primary end point occurred in 17.3% of lower-dose recipients vs 13.5% of higher-dose recipients (difference, 3.8% [1-sided 95% CI, -∞ to10%]; P value for interaction = .18) and in 16.0% with 3-day treatment vs 14.8% with 7-day treatment (difference, 1.2% [1-sided 95% CI, -∞ to 7.4%]; P value for interaction = .73).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among children with CAP discharged from an emergency department or hospital ward (within 48 hours), lower-dose outpatient oral amoxicillin was noninferior to higher dose, and 3-day duration was noninferior to 7 days, with regard to need for antibiotic re-treatment. However, disease severity, treatment setting, prior antibiotics received, and acceptability of the noninferiority margin require consideration when interpreting the findings.

### Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections – does treatment help? [^112SYcA1]. The Journal of Infection (2014). Low credibility.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common cause of respiratory tract infections (RTI's), especially in children. While severe M. pneumoniae infections are generally treated with antibiotics, the diagnosis as well as treatment of these infections should be reconsidered in the light of recent clinical findings. First, M. pneumoniae was found to be carried in the upper respiratory tract of a relatively high percentage of healthy, asymptomatic children. Clearly, this complicates the diagnosis of a suspected M. pneumoniae RTI and, thus, the decision when to initiate treatment. A complication in the treatment of these infections is that data on the efficacy of antibiotic treatment of M. pneumoniae RTI's are sparse and derived exclusively from comparative studies. A recent Cochrane review concluded that there is insufficient evidence about the efficacy of antibiotics for M. pneumoniae lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in children. Due to side effects associated with the use of tetracyclines and quinolones in children, only macrolides can be used to treat M. pneumoniae infections in young patients. The general applicability of macrolides, however, is currently threatened by the worldwide increase in macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae strains. Finally, limited evidence is available that corticosteroids might have an additional benefit in the treatment of M. pneumoniae infections. In this review, the current issues related to the diagnosis and treatment of M. pneumoniae infections will be discussed.

### Antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia in children [^113a2k5f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Pneumonia caused by bacterial pathogens is the leading cause of mortality in children in low-income countries. Early administration of antibiotics improves outcomes.

Objectives

To identify effective antibiotics for community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children by comparing various antibiotics.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2009, issue 2) which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register; MEDLINE (1966 to September 2009); and EMBASE (1990 to September 2009).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children of either sex, comparing at least two antibiotics for CAP within hospital or ambulatory (outpatient) settings.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data from full articles of selected studies.

Main Results

There were 27 studies, which enroled 11,928 children, comparing multiple antibiotics. None compared antibiotic with placebo. For ambulatory treatment of non-severe CAP, amoxycillin compared with co-trimoxazole had similar failure rates (OR 0.92; 95% CI 0.58 to 1.47) and cure rates (OR 1.12; 95% CI 0.61 to 2.03). (Three studies involved 3952 children). In children hospitalised with severe CAP, oral amoxycillin compared with injectable penicillin or ampicillin had similar failure rates (OR 0.95; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.15). (Three studies involved 3942 children). Relapse rates were similar in the two groups (OR 1.28; 95% CI 0.34 to 4.82). In very severe CAP, death rates were higher in children receiving chloramphenicol compared to those receiving penicillin/ampicillin plus gentamycin (OR 1.25; 95% CI 0.76 to 2.07). (One study involved 1116 children).

Authors' Conclusions

There were many studies with different methodologies investigating multiple antibiotics. For treatment of ambulatory patients with CAP, amoxycillin is an alternative to co-trimoxazole. With limited data on other antibiotics, co-amoxyclavulanic acid and cefpodoxime may be alternative second-line drugs. For severe pneumonia without hypoxia, oral amoxycillin may be an alternative to injectable penicillin in hospitalised children; however, for ambulatory treatment of such patients with oral antibiotics, more studies in community settings are required. For children hospitalised with severe and very severe CAP, penicillin/ampicillin plus gentamycin is superior to chloramphenicol. The other alternative drugs for such patients are ceftrioxone, levofloxacin, co-amoxyclavulanic acid and cefuroxime. Until more studies are available, these can be used as a second-line therapy. There is a need for more studies with larger patient populations and similar methodologies to compare newer antibiotics.

### Antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia in adult outpatients [^115xQSYv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is the third leading cause of death worldwide and the first leading cause of death in low-income countries. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common condition that causes a significant disease burden for the community, particularly in children younger than five years, the elderly and immunocompromised people. Antibiotics are the standard treatment for CAP. However, increasing antibiotic use is associated with the development of bacterial resistance and side effects for the patient. Several studies have been published regarding optimal antibiotic treatment for CAP but many of these data address treatments in hospitalised patients. This is an update of our 2009 Cochrane Review and addresses antibiotic therapies for CAP in outpatient settings.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of different antibiotic treatments for CAP in participants older than 12 years treated in outpatient settings with respect to clinical, radiological and bacteriological outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE (January 1966 to March week 3, 2014), EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2014), CINAHL (2009 to March 2014), Web of Science (2009 to March 2014) and LILACS (2009 to March 2014).

Selection Criteria

We looked for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), fully published in peer-reviewed journals, of antibiotics versus placebo as well as antibiotics versus another antibiotic for the treatment of CAP in outpatient settings in participants older than 12 years of age. However, we did not find any studies of antibiotics versus placebo. Therefore, this review includes RCTs of one or more antibiotics, which report the diagnostic criteria and describe the clinical outcomes considered for inclusion in this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (LMB, TJMV) independently assessed study reports in the first publication. In the 2009 update, LMB performed study selection, which was checked by TJMV and MMK. In this 2014 update, two review authors (SP, SM) independently performed and checked study selection. We contacted trial authors to resolve any ambiguities in the study reports. We compiled and analysed the data. We resolved differences between review authors by discussion and consensus.

Main Results

We included 11 RCTs in this review update (3352 participants older than 12 years with a diagnosis of CAP); 10 RCTs assessed nine antibiotic pairs (3321 participants) and one RCT assessed four antibiotics (31 participants) in people with CAP. The study quality was generally good, with some differences in the extent of the reporting. A variety of clinical, bacteriological and adverse events were reported. Overall, there was no significant difference in the efficacy of the various antibiotics. Studies evaluating clarithromycin and amoxicillin provided only descriptive data regarding the primary outcome. Though the majority of adverse events were similar between all antibiotics, nemonoxacin demonstrated higher gastrointestinal and nervous system adverse events when compared to levofloxacin, while cethromycin demonstrated significantly more nervous system side effects, especially dysgeusia, when compared to clarithromycin. Similarly, high-dose amoxicillin (1 g three times a day) was associated with higher incidence of gastritis and diarrhoea compared to clarithromycin, azithromycin and levofloxacin.

Authors' Conclusions

Available evidence from recent RCTs is insufficient to make new evidence-based recommendations for the choice of antibiotic to be used for the treatment of CAP in outpatient settings. Pooling of study data was limited by the very low number of studies assessing the same antibiotic pairs. Individual study results do not reveal significant differences in efficacy between various antibiotics and antibiotic groups. However, two studies did find significantly more adverse events with use of cethromycin as compared to clarithromycin and nemonoxacin when compared to levofloxacin. Multi-drug comparisons using similar administration schedules are needed to provide the evidence necessary for practice recommendations. Further studies focusing on diagnosis, management, cost-effectiveness and misuse of antibiotics in CAP and LRTI are warranted in high-, middle- and low-income countries.

### Antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia in children [^112AyywP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Pneumonia caused by bacterial pathogens is the leading cause of mortality in children in low-income countries. Early administration of antibiotics improves outcomes.

Objectives

To identify effective antibiotic drug therapies for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) of varying severity in children by comparing various antibiotics.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL 2012, Issue 10; MEDLINE (1966 to October week 4, 2012); EMBASE (1990 to November 2012); CINAHL (2009 to November 2012); Web of Science (2009 to November 2012) and LILACS (2009 to November 2012).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children of either sex, comparing at least two antibiotics for CAP within hospital or ambulatory (outpatient) settings.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data from the full articles of selected studies.

Main Results

We included 29 trials, which enrolled 14,188 children, comparing multiple antibiotics. None compared antibiotics with placebo. Assessment of quality of study revealed that 5 out of 29 studies were double-blind and allocation concealment was adequate. Another 12 studies were unblinded but had adequate allocation concealment, classifying them as good quality studies. There was more than one study comparing co-trimoxazole with amoxycillin, oral amoxycillin with injectable penicillin/ampicillin and chloramphenicol with ampicillin/penicillin and studies were of good quality, suggesting the evidence for these comparisons was of high quality compared to other comparisons. In ambulatory settings, for treatment of World Health Organization (WHO) defined non-severe CAP, amoxycillin compared with co-trimoxazole had similar failure rates (odds ratio (OR) 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.51) and cure rates (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.89). Three studies involved 3952 children. In children with severe pneumonia without hypoxaemia, oral antibiotics (amoxycillin/co-trimoxazole) compared with injectable penicillin had similar failure rates (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.24), hospitalisation rates (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.38 to 3.34) and relapse rates (OR 1.28, 95% CI 0.34 to 4.82). Six studies involved 4331 children below 18 years of age. In very severe CAP, death rates were higher in children receiving chloramphenicol compared to those receiving penicillin/ampicillin plus gentamicin (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.76 to 2.07). One study involved 1116 children.

Authors' Conclusions

For treatment of patients with CAP in ambulatory settings, amoxycillin is an alternative to co-trimoxazole. With limited data on other antibiotics, co-amoxyclavulanic acid and cefpodoxime may be alternative second-line drugs. Children with severe pneumonia without hypoxaemia can be treated with oral amoxycillin in an ambulatory setting. For children hospitalised with severe and very severe CAP, penicillin/ampicillin plus gentamycin is superior to chloramphenicol. The other alternative drugs for such patients are co-amoxyclavulanic acid and cefuroxime. Until more studies are available, these can be used as second-line therapies. There is a need for more studies with radiographically confirmed pneumonia in larger patient populations and similar methodologies to compare newer antibiotics. Recommendations in this review are applicable to countries with high case fatalities due to pneumonia in children without underlying morbidities and where point of care tests for identification of aetiological agents for pneumonia are not available.

### Combination of clinical symptoms and blood biomarkers can improve discrimination between bacterial or viral community-acquired pneumonia in children [^1176wMLR]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Empiric use of antibiotics remains as cornerstone of treating pneumonia in the absence of effective point-of-care diagnostics for differentiating bacterial from viral infection. Many children who have viral pneumonia will continue to receive antibiotics without benefit. Early reliable detection of viral pneumonia, or early exclusion of bacterial pneumonia, could reduce unnecessary antibiotic therapy, thereby mitigating the risk of emerging antibiotic resistance. While we have been unable to identify a single biomarker or clinical feature that could be used to confidently distinguish bacterial from viral pneumonia, our findings suggest there may be utility in more sophisticated algorithms that integrate a number of clinical, microbiological, inflammatory biomarker, or radiological factors to improve pneumonia diagnostics and better targeting therapies.

### Antibiotics for community acquired pneumonia in children [^1179k7Z5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Pneumonia is the leading cause of mortality in children. In developing countries, pneumonia is usually caused by bacterial pathogens. The early administration of empirical antibiotics improves the patients' clinical outcomes. There are currently no systematic reviews of clinical trials on this subject.

Objectives

To identify effective antibiotic drug therapy for community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children by comparing various antibiotics.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2005), MEDLINE (OVID) (1966 to January 2006) and EMBASE (WebSPIRS) (1990 to September 2005). There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in children of either sex, which compared at least two antibiotics for CAP in hospital or ambulatory settings.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data from full articles of selected studies were independently extracted by two authors.

Main Results

The review of these studies suggests that for treatment of pneumonia, co-trimoxazole is inferior in efficacy to both amoxycillin (failure rates odds ratio (OR) 1.33; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.67) and procaine penicillin (cure rates OR 2.64; 95% CI 1.57 to 4.45). Penicillin in conjunction with gentamycin was better than chloramphenicol alone (re-hospitalization rates OR 1.61; 95% CI 1.02 to 2.55). Co-amoxyclavulanic acid was better than amoxycillin alone (cure rates OR 10.44; 95% CI 2.85 to 38.21). There was no differences between injectable penicillin and oral amoxycillin (failure rates OR 1.03; 95% CI 0.81 to 1.31); azithromycin and erythromycin (cure rates OR 1.17; 95% CI 0.70 to 1.95); cefpodoxime and amoxycillin (cure rates OR 0.69; 95% CI 0.18 to 2.60); or azithromycin and co-amoxyclavulanic acid (cure rates OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.54 to 1.95, failure rates OR 1.42; 95% CI 0.43 to 4.66).

Authors' Conclusions

There were many studies each investigating multiple antibiotics with different methodologies. For treatment of ambulatory patients with CAP, amoxycillin was better than co-trimoxazole; there was no difference between azithromycin and erythromycin, or between cefpodoxime and co-amoxyclavulanic acid. For hospitalized patients, procaine penicillin was better than co-trimoxazole; and the combination of penicillin and gentamycin was better than chloramphenicol alone. Injectable penicillin and oral amoxycillin had similar failure rates. For the rest of the antibiotics there were only single studies available. There is a need for more studies with large patient populations and similar methodologies in order to compare newer antibiotics.

### Efficacy of antibiotic regimens for pneumonia in young infants aged 0–59 days: a systematic review [^1136cufe]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia Definition

We did not apply an a priori definition for pneumonia, and pneumonia definitions varied by individual trial. Some trials required radiologic criteria, such as chest radiograph findings, for the diagnosis of pneumonia, whereas others used clinical criteria. The nonhospital trials typically used the WHO clinical criteria of fast breathing pneumonia, defined as isolated tachypnea (> 60 breaths per minute), with no other clinical signs among infants aged 7 to 59 days.

Interventions

We included publications that evaluated any antibiotic regimen to treat pneumonia in young infants, as well as those that evaluated antibiotic regimens as a component of a package of interventions. We excluded studies that only enrolled infants who were treated prophylactically or on the basis of risk factors without clinical evidence of pneumonia. We also excluded studies that evaluated antiviral, antifungal, or antimalarial interventions. WHO-recommended antibiotic regimens are defined in Table 1.

Comparator

We included studies with a comparator group that was either the standard of care, an alternate antibiotic regimen, placebo, or an alternate management strategy such as referral or observation.

Outcomes

Critical outcomes were: (1) mortality (all-cause or infection-specific), (2) clinical improvement or deterioration, (3) neurodevelopmental outcomes, or (4) adverse antibiotic effects. Secondary outcomes included (a) hospital utilization (ie, length of stay or readmission), (b) relapse, and (c) cost effectiveness. We preferentially reported the latest time point available for all outcomes. Studies reporting only pharmacokinetic outcomes were excluded.

Study Selection

We initially screened studies on the basis of title and abstract, then by full text. All study screening was conducted in duplicate and adjudicated by a third author, using Covidence systematic review software.

Data Extraction and Management

We extracted data into a predesigned extraction spreadsheet. All data were independently extracted in duplicate, with discrepancies adjudicated by a third author. For published studies of infants with isolated tachypnea aged 0 to 59 days, we contacted authors to request data disaggregated into age groups of 0 to 6 days and 7 to 59 days to enable analysis of data according to WHO Integrated Management of Childhood Illness case definitions (as described in the definitions section above).

For dichotomous outcomes, we extracted event rates (n of N, %). For continuous outcomes, we extracted mean/SD or median/interquartile range. We extracted both unadjusted and adjusted effect sizes, as well as both intention-to-treat and per-protocol outcomes as reported.

- clinical and laboratory assessment of the current severity of illness and anticipated progression in order to determine whether higher levels of care or support are required

- imaging evaluation to assess the extent and progression of the pneumonic or parapneumonic process

- further investigations to identify whether the original pathogen persists, the original pathogen has developed resistance to the agent used, or there is a new secondary infecting agent.

### Viral pneumonia [^116JyY9V]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

About 200 million cases of viral community-acquired pneumonia occur every year-100 million in children and 100 million in adults. Molecular diagnostic tests have greatly increased our understanding of the role of viruses in pneumonia, and findings indicate that the incidence of viral pneumonia has been underestimated. In children, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, and parainfluenza viruses are the agents identified most frequently in both developed and developing countries. Dual viral infections are common, and a third of children have evidence of viral-bacterial co-infection. In adults, viruses are the putative causative agents in a third of cases of community-acquired pneumonia, in particular influenza viruses, rhinoviruses, and coronaviruses. Bacteria continue to have a predominant role in adults with pneumonia. Presence of viral epidemics in the community, patient's age, speed of onset of illness, symptoms, biomarkers, radiographic changes, and response to treatment can help differentiate viral from bacterial pneumonia. However, no clinical algorithm exists that will distinguish clearly the cause of pneumonia. No clear consensus has been reached about whether patients with obvious viral community-acquired pneumonia need to be treated with antibiotics. Apart from neuraminidase inhibitors for pneumonia caused by influenza viruses, there is no clear role for use of specific antivirals to treat viral community-acquired pneumonia. Influenza vaccines are the only available specific preventive measures. Further studies are needed to better understand the cause and pathogenesis of community-acquired pneumonia. Furthermore, regional differences in cause of pneumonia should be investigated, in particular to obtain more data from developing countries.

### Outpatient antibiotic use and treatment failure among children with pneumonia [^113a3iUX]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Although a viral etiology can be detected in most cases of pediatric pneumonia, antibiotic treatment is common. The effectiveness of antibiotics in the outpatient setting for children diagnosed with pneumonia is not known.

Objective

To compare outcomes among children diagnosed with pneumonia who were and were not treated with oral antibiotics.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study identified Medicaid-insured children and adolescents 17 years or younger diagnosed with pneumonia and discharged from ambulatory settings in a multistate claims database from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2019. Propensity score matching was used to mitigate confounding. Data were analyzed from August 31, 2023, to August 16, 2024.

Exposures

Antibiotic receipt, defined as an oral antibiotic dispensed from a pharmacy on the day of the index visit or on the subsequent day. Children who did not receive antibiotics included those who were not prescribed antibiotics and those who were prescribed antibiotics but did not fill the prescription.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Treatment failure and severe outcomes within 2 to 14 days after the index visit. Treatment failure included hospitalization or ambulatory revisits for pneumonia, new antibiotic dispensation with a same-day ambulatory visit, or complicated pneumonia. Severe outcomes included hospitalization for pneumonia or complicated pneumonia.

Results

Among the 103 854 children with pneumonia included in the analysis, the median age was 5 (IQR, 2–9) years, and 54 665 (52.6%) were male. Overall, 20 435 children (19.7%) did not receive an antibiotic within 1 day. The propensity score-matched analysis included 40 454 children (20 227 per group). Treatment failure occurred in 2167 children (10.7%) who did not receive antibiotics and 1766 (8.7%) who received antibiotics (risk difference, 1.98 [95% CI, 1.41–2.56] percentage points). Severe outcomes occurred in 234 of 20 435 children (1.1%) who did not receive antibiotics and in 133 of 83 419 (0.7%) who did (risk difference, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.28–0.64] percentage points).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study of children diagnosed with pneumonia in ambulatory settings, almost 20% did not receive antibiotics within a day of diagnosis. Although not receiving antibiotics was associated with a small increase in the risk of treatment failure, severe outcomes were uncommon regardless of whether antibiotics were received. These results suggest that some children diagnosed with pneumonia can likely be managed without antibiotics and highlight the need for prospective studies to identify these children.

### Factors associated with pneumonia severity in children: a systematic review [^115t58aL]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2018). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia in children is associated with significant morbidity and mortality; however, data are limited in predicting which children will have negative outcomes, including clinical deterioration, severe disease, or development of complications. The Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America (PIDS/IDSA) pediatric pneumonia guideline includes criteria that were modified from adult criteria and define pneumonia severity to assist with resource allocation and site-of-care decision-making. However, the PIDS/IDSA criteria have not been formally developed or validated in children. Definitions for mild, moderate, and severe pneumonia also vary across the literature, further complicating the development of standardized severity criteria. This systematic review summarizes (1) the current state of the evidence for defining and predicting pneumonia severity in children as well as (2) emerging evidence focused on risk stratification of children with pneumonia.

### Community-acquired pneumonia in children: myths and facts [^113H2zW8]. American Journal of Perinatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the leading cause of death in children < 5 years of age worldwide. It is also one of the most frequent infectious diseases in children, leading to large antibiotic use and hospitalization even in the industrialized countries. However, the optimal management of CAP in children is still not well defined. Currently, respiratory viruses are considered the most frequent etiologic agents, but detection of viruses in the upper respiratory tract does not guarantee causation of pneumonia, nor precludes the presence of a bacterial pathogen. In both the upper and lower respiratory tract, respiratory viruses and pathogenic bacteria interact. Emerging evidence indicates that dual viral-bacterial infections function synergistically in many cases and together likely enhance the severity of CAP. Therefore, new and advanced technologies capable of sensitively and specifically discriminating viral, bacterial, and viral-bacterial coinfections are needed. Instead of focusing on the pathogen, analysis of host immune transcriptome profiles from children with CAP can potentially offer diagnostic signatures, help to assess disease severity, and eventually, prognostic indicators. An optimized management strategy by using molecular pathogen testing and transcriptome profiling will facilitate prompt, more appropriate, and targeted therapies, which in turn will lead to improved clinical outcomes in children with CAP.

### Oxygen therapy for children: a key tool in reducing deaths from pneumonia [^113sgGu8]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Oxygen is one of the most basic medical therapies we have for acute respiratory illnesses and it has been an established part of medical practice for over 100 years. However, most patients who may benefit from oxygen in low‐ and middle‐income countries will not receive it — either because oxygen is not available or because their need for oxygen is unrecognized. This gap takes an enormous toll, with modeling estimates suggesting that improved pulse oximetry and oxygen access could avert 148 000 under‐five child pneumonia deaths annually in the 15 countries with the highest pneumonia burden 1. This commentary explores the reasons for this gap, using Nigeria as an illustrative case study in how oxygen access can be improved globally, and concluding with key actions for policy and practice.

### Guideline adoption for community-acquired pneumonia in the outpatient setting [^111dvdRj]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America national childhood community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guideline encouraged the standard evaluation and treatment of children who were managed as outpatients. Our objectives were to (1) increase adherence to guideline-recommended diagnostics and antibiotic treatment of CAP at 5 pediatric primary care practices (PPCPs) by using quality-improvement methods and (2) evaluate the association between guideline adherence and unscheduled follow-up visits.

Methods

Immunocompetent children > 3 months of age with no complex chronic conditions and who were diagnosed with CAP were eligible for inclusion in this stepped-wedge study. Interventions were focused on education, knowledge of colleagues' prescribing practices, and feedback sessions. Statistical process control charts were used to assess changes in recommendations and antibiotic treatment. Unscheduled follow-up visits were compared across time by using generalized estimating equations that were clustered by PPCP.

Results

CAP was diagnosed in 1906 children. Guideline recommended therapy and pulse oximetry use increased from a mean baseline of 24.9% to a mean of 68.0% and from 4.3% to 85.0%, respectively, over the study period. Among children > 5 years of age, but not among those who were younger, the receipt of guideline recommended antibiotics, as compared with nonguideline therapy, was associated with the increased likelihood of unscheduled follow-up (adjusted odds ratio, 2.12; 95% confidence interval: 1.31–3.43). Chest radiographs and complete blood cell counts were rarely performed at baseline.

Conclusions

Recommendations for limited use of chest radiographs and complete blood cell counts and standardized antibiotic therapy in children is supported at PPCPs. However, the guideline may need to include macrolide monotherapy as appropriate antibiotic therapy for older children.

### Quality of antibiotic prescribing for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient care [^113mKYmj]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotics remain the primary treatment for community acquired pneumonia (CAP), however rising rates of antimicrobial resistance may jeopardize their future efficacy. With higher rates of disease reported in the youngest populations, effective treatment courses for pediatric pneumonia are of paramount importance. This study is the first to examine the quality of pediatric antibiotic use by agent, dose and duration.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study included all outpatient/primary care physician visits for pediatric CAP (aged < 19 years) between January 1 2014 to December 31 2018. Relevant practice guidelines were identified, and treatment recommendations extracted. Amoxicillin was the primary first-line agent for pediatric CAP. Categories of prescribing included: guideline adherent, effective but unnecessary (excess dose and/or duration), under treatment (insufficient dose and/or duration), and not recommended. Proportions of attributable-antibiotic use were examined by prescribing category, and then stratified by age and sex.

Result(s)

A total of 42,452 episodes of pediatric CAP were identified. Of those, 31,347 (76%) resulted in an antibiotic prescription. Amoxicillin accounted for 51% of all prescriptions. Overall, 27% of prescribing was fully guideline adherent, 19% effective but unnecessary, 10% under treatment, and 44% not recommended by agent. Excessive duration was the hallmark of effective but unnecessary prescribing (97%) Macrolides accounted for the majority on non-first line agent use, with only 32% of not recommended prescribing preceded by a previous course of antibiotics.

Conclusion(s)

This study is the first in Canada to examine prescribing quality for pediatric CAP by agent, dose and duration. Utilizing first-line agents, and shorter-course treatments are targets for stewardship.

Respiratory disease is common in pediatrics and diagnosing pneumonia may be clinically challenging. Changes in pneumococcal resistance and immunization practices continue to change the incidence and etiologies of pneumonia. Careful attention to epidemiologic, seasonal, and specific pediatric clinical factors and using adjunct radiographs and laboratory tests should guide the emergency physician in his or her management strategy, including selection of antibiotics and inpatient or outpatient disposition.

### Quality of antibiotic prescribing for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient care [^115C8Zf2]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pneumonia remains one of the leading global causes of mortality particularly in children, and older adults. In Canada, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is associated to substantial morbidity, mortality and economic burden. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) encompasses infections outside of a hospital setting. Up to 80% of patients with pneumonia are treated in the community, however the etiology of CAP is heterogeneous with both bacterial and viral etiologies prevalent in children. Underlying pathogens can include S. pneumoniae however viral infections, and mixed bacterial-viral infections are common, contributing to the complexity of pathogen detection and treatment. In light of this heterogeneity, physicians rarely have knowledge of precise etiology, and treatment is commonly empiric in nature.

The evaluation of outpatient prescribing is often contingent on patient factors not captured within routine, administrative health data. Prior efforts to overcome gaps include the establishment of expected, or maximal, prescribing rates in order to create a benchmark against which antibiotic use may be contextualized. Most often generated using expert consensus methodology, these markers are inherently limited by participant self-selection, physician biases to specific populations, and issues with reliability/external validity. Moreover, these results provide high-level interpretations of appropriate use, which has been subject to criticism given the lack of robust patient information to sufficiently elucidate prescription quality. Efforts are further limited by the absence of standardized nomenclature.

This retrospective cohort study is the first in Canada to examine the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions issued for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia, in outpatient care. In British Columbia (BC), Canada Bugs & Drugs™ is a provincially utilized clinical reference, published in 2012. The objective of this study was to utilize this resource, as well as other relevant practice guidelines available during the study period, to examine appropriate antibiotic use. The use of guidelines to define categories of prescribing offer a novel, objective interpretation of prescribing quality when compared to previous efforts of expert opinion. Our objectives were to determine the quality of antibiotic prescribing for pediatric CAP by agent, dose and duration. Appropriate use by agent was hypothesized to account for a majority of antibiotic use, while duration of therapy was expected to exceed guideline recommendations.

### Interpretation of antibiotic trials in pediatric pneumonia [^111CHG6y]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

In this analysis of prospectively collected data mirroring the inclusion criteria for a recent antibiotic trial of pediatric CAP, we observed that only 30.3% of children who met the criteria had positive radiographs, which is similar to the rate of lobar radiographic pneumonia in the CAP-IT trial (34%). Additionally, 48.3% of patients recovered from their illness without antibiotic use. Prior data suggest that most children with suspected pneumonia and negative radiographs recover without antibiotics.

A study limitation is the lack of a true gold standard for pneumonia diagnosis in children. We hypothesize that most antibiotic trials in pediatric CAP include many patients without pneumonia and thus may be underpowered to identify true differences in outcomes for children with bacterial pneumonia. These important pragmatic trials support reducing the intensity of antibiotic use in children with respiratory illness. However, widespread use of deintensified antibiotic regimens for all children with pneumonia, particularly those with lobar consolidations, may be premature given the paucity of evidence supporting their efficacy for these populations.

### Placebo vs amoxicillin for nonsevere fast-breathing pneumonia in Malawian children aged 2 to 59 months: a double-blind, randomized clinical noninferiority trial [^117TXdGQ]. JAMA Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Pneumonia is the leading infectious killer of children. Rigorous evidence supporting antibiotic treatment of children with nonsevere fast-breathing pneumonia in low-resource African settings is lacking.

Objective

To assess whether treatment with placebo for nonsevere fast-breathing pneumonia is substantively less effective than 3 days of treatment with amoxicillin.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This double-blind, 2-arm, randomized clinical noninferiority trial with follow-up of 14 days screened 1343 HIV-uninfected children aged 2 to 59 months with nonsevere fast-breathing pneumonia at outpatient departments of hospitals in Lilongwe, Malawi, Africa, between June 2016 and June 2017.

Interventions

Placebo or amoxicillin dispersible tablets administered twice daily for 3 days.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was the proportion of children failing treatment by day 4 with a relative noninferiority margin of 1.5 times the failure rate in the amoxicillin group. Primary analyses were performed based on the intention-to-treat principle. Planned secondary analyses included treatment failure or relapse by day 14.

Results

In total, 1126 children were randomized to 3 days of amoxicillin (n = 564) or placebo (n = 562) therapy. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were similar between the groups. For the entire study population, the mean (SD) age was 21.3 (15.1) months, and 601 (53.4%) were female. After an interim analysis, the data safety monitoring board stopped the study because children receiving amoxicillin had a 4.0% (22 of 552 with outcome data) treatment failure rate by day 4, whereas children receiving placebo had a 7.0% (38 of 543) treatment failure rate (adjusted relative risk, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.07%-2.97%; adjusted absolute difference, 3.0%; 95% CI, 0.4%-5.7%). Among children with known day 14 outcomes, 56 of 552 (10.1%) receiving amoxicillin and 64 of 543 (11.8%) receiving placebo had either treatment failure by day 4 or relapse by day 14 (relative risk, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.83%-1.63%; absolute difference, 1.6%; 95% CI, -2.1% to 5.4%). There were no deaths.

Conclusions and Relevance

In HIV-uninfected children aged 2 to 59 months in a malaria-endemic region of Malawi, placebo treatment of nonsevere fast-breathing pneumonia was significantly inferior to treatment with amoxicillin. However, by day 4, approximately 93% of children receiving placebo were without treatment failure, and there was no significant difference between groups in treatment failure or relapse by day 14. The number of children with nonsevere fast-breathing pneumonia that needed amoxicillin treatment for 1 child to benefit was 33.

### Ambulatory short-course high-dose oral amoxicillin for treatment of severe pneumonia in children: a randomised equivalency trial [^11167Rep]. Lancet (2008). Excellent credibility.

Background

WHO case management guidelines for severe pneumonia involve referral to hospital for treatment with parenteral antibiotics. If equally as effective as parenteral treatment, home-based oral antibiotic treatment could reduce referral, admission, and treatment costs. Our aim was to determine whether home treatment with high-dose oral amoxicillin and inpatient treatment with parenteral ampicillin were equivalent for the treatment of severe pneumonia in children.

Methods

This randomised, open-label equivalency trial was done at seven study sites in Pakistan. 2037 children aged 3–59 months with severe pneumonia were randomly allocated to either initial hospitalisation and parenteral ampicillin (100 mg/kg per day in four doses) for 48 h, followed by 3 days of oral amoxicillin (80–90 mg/kg per day; n = 1012) or to home-based treatment for 5 days with oral amoxicillin (80–90 mg/kg per day in two doses; n = 1025). Follow-up assessments were done at 1, 3, 6, and 14 days after enrollment. The primary outcome was treatment failure (clinical deterioration) by day 6. Analyses were done per protocol and by intention to treat. This trial is registered, ISRCTN95821329.

Findings

In the per-protocol population, 36 individuals were excluded from the hospitalised group and 37 from the ambulatory group, mainly because of protocol violations or loss to follow-up. There were 87 (8.6%) treatment failures in the hospitalised group and 77 (7.5%) in the ambulatory group (risk difference 1.1%; 95% CI -1.3 to 3.5) by day 6. Five (0.2%) children died within 14 days of enrollment, one in the ambulatory group and four in the hospitalised group. In each case, treatment failure was declared before death and the antibiotic had been changed. None of the deaths were considered to be associated with treatment allocation; there were no serious adverse events reported in the trial.

Interpretation

Home treatment with high-dose oral amoxicillin is equivalent to currently recommended hospitalisation and parenteral ampicillin for treatment of severe pneumonia without underlying complications, suggesting that WHO recommendations for treatment of severe pneumonia need to be revised.

### Efficacy of antibiotic regimens for pneumonia in young infants aged 0–59 days: a systematic review [^117RkyV5]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Risk of Bias Assessment

We determined the risk of bias (RoB) among included studies using the revised Cochrane RoB tool for randomized trials (RoB-2)and the revised Cochrane RoB-2 tool for cluster-randomized trials. RoB was assessed by 2 independent assessors and discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Consistent with Cochrane guidance, a study was deemed to have an overall high RoB if there was high risk in any 1 domain or some risk in 3 or more domains. A study was defined to have overall some RoB if there was some risk in 1 or 2 domains, and overall low RoB if there was low risk in every domain.

Data Analysis and Synthesis

We calculated relative and absolute effect sizes for reported outcomes using the numbers of study participants and events for the individually randomized trials. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) and risk difference and 95% CI. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) and 95% CI. For cluster randomized trials (CRTs), we reported effect sizes adjusted for clustering effects where available. We preferentially used intention-to-treat over per-protocol outcomes for calculating effect sizes and determining certainty of evidence. Meta-analysis was not conducted because of the small number of heterogeneous studies for each comparison.

The certainty of evidence for each comparison and prioritized outcomes was assigned using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methods and categorized certainty as very low, low, moderate, or high certainty. The grading of the certainty of the evidence was based on RoB, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and presence of publication bias. See Supplemental Appendix 2 for additional details.

### Diagnosis and management of pneumonia in infants less than 90 days of age [^111p1y1s]. Hospital Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Current guidelines and recent studies on pediatric pneumonia pertain to children older than 3 months of age. Little information exists regarding the diagnostic evaluation, management, and outcomes of infants less than 90 days with pneumonia.

Methods

We compared infants < 90 days of age diagnosed with pneumonia across 38 US children's hospitals from 2016 to 2021 to children 90 days to 5 years of age. We evaluated whether differences exist in patient characteristics, diagnostic testing, antibiotic treatment, and outcomes between young infants and older children. Additionally, we assessed seasonal variability and trends over time in pneumonia diagnoses by age group.

Results

Among 109796 children diagnosed with pneumonia, 3128 (2.8%) were < 90 days of age. Compared with older children, infants < 90 days had more laboratory testing performed (88.6% vs 48.8%, P < .001; median number of laboratory tests 4 [interquartile range: 2–5] vs 0 [interquartile range: 0–3] respectively), with wide variation in testing across hospitals. Chest radiograph utilization did not differ by age group. Infants < 90 days were more likely to be hospitalized and require respiratory support than older children. Seasonal variation was observed for pneumonia encounters in both age groups.

Conclusions

Infants < 90 days with pneumonia were more likely to undergo laboratory testing, be hospitalized, and require respiratory support than children 90 days to 5 years of age. This may reflect inherent differences in the pathophysiology of pneumonia by age, the manner in which pneumonia is diagnosed, or possible overuse of testing in infants.

### Emergency management of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia: what is new since the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America / American Thoracic Society guidelines [^113ED6Wg]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major health problem in the United States and is associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. Patients with CAP commonly present to emergency departments where physicians must make critical decisions regarding diagnosis and management of pneumonia in a timely fashion, with emphasis on efficient and cost-effective diagnostic choices, consideration of emerging antimicrobial resistance, timely initiation of antibiotics, and appropriate site-of-care decisions. In light of the burden that pneumonia places on health care systems and the emergency department in particular, this article reviews significant developments in the management of CAP in the United States 5 years since the publication of the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society consensus guidelines on the management of CAP in adults, focusing on recent studies and recommendations for managing CAP, the primary bacterial pathogens responsible for CAP, and trends in resistance, new diagnostic technologies, and newer antimicrobials approved for the treatment of CAP. These new data and additional guidelines pertaining to the treatment of CAP further our knowledge and understanding of this challenging infection. Furthermore, appreciation of the availability of new diagnostic testing and therapeutic options will help meet the demand for improved management of CAP.

### Guidelines for the use of chest radiographs in community-acquired pneumonia in children and adolescents [^1118qjWp]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Guidelines for imaging in suspected community-acquired pneumonia

National guidance on community-acquired pneumonia from the United Kingdom and the United States indicates that chest radiographs are not recommended routinely in uncomplicated cases. However, there are defined situations where chest radiographs might be helpful in making the diagnosis, such as when there is pyrexia with only mild respiratory symptoms. The main reason why chest radiography is not routinely recommended in the ambulatory setting is that there is no evidence of a substantial impact on clinical outcomes, which is also true for developing countries. This is because radiography cannot reliably differentiate viral from bacterial pneumonia and therefore does not impact on choice of treatment with antibiotics.

Clinical practice and adherence to guidance is multifactorial and includes the clinical context (developed vs. developing world), the confidence of the attending physician, the changing incidence of complications (according to the success of immunisation programs), the availability of alternative imaging (and its relationship to perceived risks of radiation) and the reliability of the interpretation of imaging. The most recent British Thoracic Society guidance regarding community-acquired pneumonia is summarised in Table 1 alongside the clinical practice guidelines by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America for the management of community-acquired pneumonia in infants and children older than 3 months. It should be noted, however, that in creating these guidelines, when the evidence for the guidance is lacking, consensus is employed. In addition, guidelines are intended to be assistive, rather than directive, and therefore clinicians often operate outside the guidance in line with their clinical experience, e.g. it has been shown that junior doctors are more likely to use guidelines rigidly than more senior doctors, who tend to go on clinical intuition. In practice, chest radiographs are performed frequently for suspected pneumonia in children. An official British Thoracic Society audit identified that a chest radiograph had been performed to confirm the diagnosis in 90–94% of suspected community-acquired pneumonia cases and concluded that there was an over-reliance on investigations to diagnose pneumonia.

### Placebo vs amoxicillin for nonsevere fast-breathing pneumonia in Malawian children aged 2 to 59 months: a double-blind, randomized clinical noninferiority trial [^114VwXEt]. JAMA Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Approximately 920 000 children die of pneumonia annually before their fifth birthday. There is a critical need to provide greater access to appropriate and effective treatment. Treatment of bacterial pneumonia requires an effective antibiotic used in adequate doses for an appropriate duration. A 3-day course of twice-daily amoxicillin is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) as first-line treatment of nonsevere fast-breathing pneumonia among immune-competent children aged 5 years or less. The WHO's integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) guidelines identify fast-breathing pneumonia in children with cough or difficult breathing who demonstrate fast breathing without WHO danger signs. However, not all cases of fast breathing are bacterial pneumonia. Indeed, the majority of fast-breathing pneumonia cases are likely not pneumonia at all. There are many reasons that a child might demonstrate fast breathing, and not all indicate disease. Thus, isolated fast breathing may not be appropriately sensitive nor specific for diagnosing pneumonia, making antibiotic treatment unnecessary. Although it is relatively well tolerated among children, amoxicillin has side effects and causes serious but rare adverse events. Furthermore, inappropriate antibiotic use may lead to antibiotic resistance.,

Current case management guidelines maximize diagnostic sensitivity over specificity, potentially resulting in antibiotic overuse. Existing research suggests that most fast-breathing pneumonia cases will resolve without antibiotic therapy. In a study evaluating fever etiology among outpatient children in Tanzania, the authors found that, in the absence of critical illness and malaria, most febrile children could be treated supportively without antibiotics. There is a need to appropriately treat children with bacterial pneumonia with antibiotics and to not unnecessarily treat children with illnesses unresponsive to antibiotics.

Studies in Asia have evaluated the effectiveness of 3-day amoxicillin treatment of fast-breathing pneumonia;, however, evidence is needed to evaluate whether any antibiotic treatment is required. There have been multiple calls for carefully designed, scientifically sound studies repeated in different geographic regions to assess the need for antibiotic treatment of fast-breathing pneumonia. Given the paucity of such data from Africa, there is a critical need for African-specific research in malaria-endemic settings to establish optimal management of fast-breathing pneumonia in children.

### New recommendations for pediatric pneumonia treatment | Blogs… [^112npuSe]. blogs.cdc.gov (2011). Low credibility.

New Recommendations for Pediatric Pneumonia TreatmentPosted on by Author: John S Bradley, MD Pediatric Infectious Disease Specialist at Rady Children's Hospital and Health Center Every year, pneumonia kills more than 2 million children ages 5 years and younger worldwide. Yet the only existing national guidelines for the treatment of pneumonia focus on adults, and the recommended diagnostic methods and treatments may be too risky and not have the desired result in children. After two years of work, my colleagues from various backgrounds and I have completed the first-ever comprehensive national guidelines on diagnosing and treating infants and children affected by this life-threatening disease: "The Management of Community-Acquired Pneumonia in Infants and Children Older Than 3 Months of Age: Clinical Practice Guidelines by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America".

These guidelines contain exhaustive input from many different specialties to provide important new information on pneumonia treatment and prevention for doctors, nurse practitioners and physician's assistants. For instance, antibiotic-resistant bacteria that used to cause pneumonia are now rare, thanks to immunizations, and for the first time in 40 years, we can prescribe ampicillin to effectively treat the disease. For kids who are not as sick and can be treated at home, plain old, safe amoxicillin is again the preferred antibiotic. We've also documented that most kids diagnosed with pneumonia actually have viral chest colds – and of course, do NOT need antibiotics for treatment. Pneumonia guidelines wouldn't be complete without giving credit to the routine pneumococcal and. Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccines now provided to all U. S. children for dramatically decreasing contraction of bacterial pneumonia. We need to keep up the good work.

Because influenza can make a child more susceptible to bacterial pneumonia, it is essential to immunize kids annually with the flu vaccine. We all can agree that it's better to prevent disease and suffering than to need to treat it. There is a summary of the guidelines in the first few pages of the document, which consists of 52 pages of recommendations backed by 340 references. Keep in mind that these are only meant to g uide providers, who must use their best judgment in treating each child. We're hopeful that these guidelines will spur physicians and hospitals to collect data and compare their results, enabling us to revise the guidelines over time.

After completing this article, readers should be able to: Pneumonia in children is encountered commonly in daily practice, and otherwise healthy children typically do well with outpatient treatment. It is important, however, to recognize those children who are at risk for or who already are experiencing severe or complicated pneumonia and to monitor and treat them. Pneumonia usually can be diagnosed clinically, although radiographs may be useful to corroborate the clinical findings or identify complications. Antibiotic selection is important, and the treating clinician should consider prevalent organisms, the child's age, and the presence of risk factors for atypical or resistant organisms. Occasionally, in more severe or complicated cases, hospitalization may be necessary to provide intravenous antibiotics, fluids, oxygen, and other supportive measures and to facilitate necessary invasive procedures to diagnose and treat complications.

Fortunately, appropriate immunization and proper personal hygiene can go far in. Comments.
