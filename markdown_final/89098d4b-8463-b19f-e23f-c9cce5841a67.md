## Question

Long covid curable?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether long COVID is curable. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "long COVID" and what "curable" means in this context. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence on natural history and recovery trajectories. Next, I will examine whether any disease-modifying therapies exist or are in trials. After that, I need to assess current management standards and their intent. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically honest answer and outline what patients can expect and what might change the outlook in the future.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't jump to conclusions. Long COVID, also called post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection or post-COVID-19 condition, is an infection-associated chronic condition with symptoms persisting or emerging at least 3 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, affecting one or more organ systems, with symptoms typically lasting at least 2 months and not better explained by alternative diagnoses [^fc6d14c9] [^d85b81a8] [^2e352faa].

> Now, I need to check what "curable" implies here. In clinical terms, "curable" generally means a treatment reliably eradicates the underlying disease process and restores pre-illness function, whereas "treatable" means symptoms and function can improve with management even if the disease mechanism persists. Given the heterogeneity and multisystem nature of long COVID, I should be careful not to conflate symptom control with disease cure [^6b4b4a1e].

> Next, I should review the natural history and recovery patterns. Wait, let me verify the trajectory data. In the large, prospectively followed RECOVER cohort, about 10% met research criteria for long COVID at 3 months; of those, 46% had persistent symptoms, 35% had intermittent symptoms, and 19% improved over the subsequent year, indicating that a meaningful minority do recover, but most have ongoing or fluctuating symptoms without definitive resolution over 12–15 months [^0d9055f9] [^58603650]. Hold on, I should also check longer-term immunologic data. A separate 24-month study found that while 62% showed resolution of previously detected immune dysregulation, 38% did not, and symptom recovery did not always track with immunologic normalization, underscoring that some patients have persistent drivers or organ injury even as markers improve [^cece0cb7].

> I will now examine whether any disease-modifying therapy has proven curative. I need to ensure I'm not overstating early signals. Currently, there are no FDA-approved or guideline-endorsed curative therapies for long COVID; management is supportive and symptom-targeted, and major guidelines emphasize rehabilitation, pacing, and multidisciplinary care rather than cures [^d7804bf6] [^115e7d1d] [^090a5d71]. Let me consider investigational directions. Trials are exploring antivirals to clear putative viral reservoirs, immunomodulators like IVIG for autonomic dysfunction, and other targeted strategies, but these remain experimental and unproven for curing long COVID at this time [^13094bd9] [^adb674e4] [^4feb85bc].

> Next, I should review current management and its intent. Guidelines recommend symptom-based care, graded return-to-activity with pacing to avoid post-exertional malaise, rehabilitation tailored to cardiopulmonary and neurologic sequelae, mental health support, and coordination of multidisciplinary care; the goal is functional recovery and quality-of-life improvement, not eradication of the disease process itself [^d7804bf6] [^115e7d1d] [^090a5d71] [^bfeb8b2b]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with primary care guidance; yes, CDC guidance similarly emphasizes validating symptoms, shared decision-making, and symptom-targeted management rather than curative treatment [^35b2aa7c].

> But wait, what if prevention of long COVID counts as a form of "cure" before it starts? I should double-check vaccine effects. Vaccination reduces the risk of developing long COVID after breakthrough infection, but does not eliminate it, reinforcing that even with prevention, a substantial burden remains and that prior infection can still lead to persistent symptoms in some individuals [^73ce48ec] [^65b21de9].

> Let me synthesize and be explicit. Based on current high-quality evidence, long COVID is not considered curable at this time. A subset of patients improve or recover over months, but many have persistent or fluctuating symptoms, and no proven disease-modifying therapy exists to eradicate the condition, so management remains supportive and rehabilitative rather than curative [^0d9055f9] [^58603650] [^d7804bf6] [^115e7d1d].

> I should confirm what this means for patients and clinicians. Prognosis is heterogeneous and unpredictable; clinicians should set expectations for gradual improvement with relapsing–remitting courses, counsel on pacing and activity modification, and coordinate multidisciplinary care, while acknowledging uncertainty and validating patient experiences. Patients should be informed that recovery is possible but not guaranteed, and that ongoing research may change the landscape [^65b21de9] [^35b2aa7c] [^1ce9981c].

> Finally, I need to ensure I note what could change this answer. If ongoing or future trials demonstrate that antivirals, immunomodulators, or other targeted therapies reliably normalize pathophysiology and restore function in a reproducible, durable way, then "curable" could become accurate for defined phenotypes. Until such evidence emerges, the honest, reference-aligned answer is that long COVID is not currently curable, though it is treatable and many patients do improve with time and supportive care [^13094bd9] [^4feb85bc] [^d7804bf6].

---

Long COVID is **not currently curable**, but many patients improve over time with supportive care [^65b21de9]. There is **no proven cure** or single therapy that reverses the condition, and management focuses on symptom control, rehabilitation, and multidisciplinary care [^d7804bf6] [^115e7d1d]. Recovery is variable: some patients fully recover, others have persistent symptoms, and about 10–20% remain significantly impaired at 6–12 months [^0d9055f9] [^58603650]. Ongoing research and trials may yield disease-modifying treatments, but none are approved yet [^4feb85bc] [^c30cba3d].

## Current understanding of long COVID

Long COVID is defined by symptoms persisting or emerging **≥ 3 months after acute infection**, lasting≥ 2 months, and not explained by alternative diagnoses [^fc6d14c9] [^d85b81a8]. It is **multisystem and heterogeneous**, with> 200 reported symptoms, including fatigue, dyspnea, cognitive impairment, and autonomic dysfunction [^d85b81a8] [^a2c71337].

---

## Evidence on recovery and cure

- **Natural history**: Many patients improve over time, but recovery is variable and unpredictable [^0d9055f9] [^58603650].
- **Persistence**: A substantial proportion have symptoms beyond 6–12 months, and some develop new symptoms over time [^0d9055f9] [^58603650].
- **Immune dysregulation**: Persistent immune abnormalities are documented in some patients, though a subset show immunologic resolution by 24 months [^cece0cb7].

---

## Current management strategies

Management is **supportive and symptom-targeted**, with no proven cure:

- **Multidisciplinary care**: Rehabilitation, respiratory therapy, neurology, mental health, and primary care coordination [^d7804bf6] [^115e7d1d].
- **Symptom management**: Medications for pain, fatigue, sleep, and autonomic symptoms; pacing strategies for post-exertional malaise [^bfeb8b2b] [^090a5d71].
- **Rehabilitation**: Graded exercise, breathing techniques, and cognitive rehabilitation as tolerated [^aaf0cdc3] [^a8b7eb31].

---

## Ongoing research and clinical trials

Several **investigational therapies** are under study, including:

| **Therapy** | **Mechanism** | **Status** |
|-|-|-|
| Antivirals (e.g. Paxlovid) | Potential viral reservoir clearance | Phase 2 trial (RECOVER) [^4feb85bc] |
| IVIG | Immune modulation | RECOVER-AUTO trial [^adb674e4] |
| Metformin | Anti-inflammatory/antiviral | Trial in progress |
| Low-dose naltrexone | Immune modulation | Small studies, pending larger trials |

---

## Factors influencing recovery

Recovery is influenced by **illness severity**, with more severe acute disease increasing risk of persistent symptoms [^5e166813] [^65e1e467]. Female sex, older age, and comorbidities are also associated with higher risk and slower recovery [^d85b81a8] [^65b21de9]. Vaccination reduces risk but does not eliminate long COVID [^73ce48ec].

---

## Patient-reported outcomes and quality of life

Patients report **persistent fatigue, cognitive impairment, and functional limitations** that impair work, social roles, and daily activities [^e74b2b9f] [^6b4b4a1e]. Mental health impacts are common, including anxiety, depression, and PTSD, requiring integrated mental health care [^18c00f02] [^4271994d].

---

## Conclusion and future outlook

Long COVID is **not currently curable**, but many patients improve with time and supportive care. No single therapy reverses the condition, and management remains symptom-based and multidisciplinary [^d7804bf6] [^115e7d1d]. Ongoing research may yield disease-modifying treatments, but none are approved yet [^4feb85bc] [^c30cba3d].

### Challenges and opportunities in long COVID research [^f7d5052a]. Immunity (2024). Medium credibility.

Long COVID (LC) is a condition in which patients do not fully recover from the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection but rather have persistent or new symptoms for months to years following the infection. Ongoing research efforts are investigating the pathophysiologic mechanisms of LC and exploring preventative and therapeutic treatment approaches for patients. As a burgeoning area of investigation, LC research can be structured to be more inclusive, innovative, and effective. In this perspective, we highlight opportunities for patient engagement and diverse research expertise, as well as the challenges of developing definitions and reproducible studies. Our intention is to provide a foundation for collaboration and progress in understanding the biomarkers and mechanisms driving LC.

### The importance of including long COVID outcomes when developing novel treatments for acute COVID-19 [^4c8f015c]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Amid efforts to develop effective treatments for acute COVID-19, there is growing recognition of the need to address long COVID as a key outcome measure. We argue there are 7 compelling reasons to include long COVID measurements in clincal trials investigating acute COVID-19 treatments: (1) Long COVID is not rare. (2) Long COVID is debilitating to individuals and has a high societal cost. (3) Those at high risk of severe COVID-19 are also at higher risk of developing long COVID if they are infected with COVID-19. (4) Treatments for acute COVID-19 may reduce the risk of long COVID. (5) Measures exist to track long COVID. (6) Long COVID considerations are potentially important for acute COVID-19 treatment decision making. (7) Deaths and hospitalizations due to COVID-19 are increasingly rare. While not every trial needs to include assessments of long COVID, it is worth the research burden to include assessments where possible, as this could facilitate the uptake of acute COVID-19 treatments that lessen the societal burden of long COVID.

### Long COVID trajectories in the prospectively followed RECOVER-adult US cohort [^1abb64f4]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The present study was intended to describe the natural history of Long COVID. The variability across individual-level trajectories will enable future studies to evaluate risk factors and biomarkers from biological samples that could predict future outcomes and explain differences in time to recovery, and identify potential therapeutic targets. Time-varying exposures can also be incorporated into future analyses, providing additional clues to potentially tractable factors impacting the trajectory over time. These findings will also provide vital information for well-designed interventional clinical trials and for clinicians and public health agencies in support of Long COVID patients.

In summary, we found that among individuals with a known history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 5% had a profile characterized by a persistently high Long COVID-related symptom burden and an additional 12% had an intermittently high burden of symptoms that did not improve over time. Among the 10% of participants who developed Long COVID based on the research index threshold at 3 months after their first infection, the majority had persistent or intermittent symptoms, while 19% showed improvement over the subsequent year. These subgroups will be critically important to target enrollment for future studies of pathophysiologic mechanisms, preventive strategies, and treatments.

### COVID-19 drug discovery and treatment options [^c30cba3d]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused substantial morbidity and mortality, and serious social and economic disruptions worldwide. Unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated older individuals with underlying diseases are especially prone to severe disease. In patients with non-fatal disease, long COVID affecting multiple body systems may persist for months. Unlike SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which have either been mitigated or remained geographically restricted, SARS-CoV-2 has disseminated globally and is likely to continue circulating in humans with possible emergence of new variants that may render vaccines less effective. Thus, safe, effective and readily available COVID-19 therapeutics are urgently needed. In this Review, we summarize the major drug discovery approaches, preclinical antiviral evaluation models, representative virus-targeting and host-targeting therapeutic options, and key therapeutics currently in clinical use for COVID-19. Preparedness against future coronavirus pandemics relies not only on effective vaccines but also on broad-spectrum antivirals targeting conserved viral components or universal host targets, and new therapeutics that can precisely modulate the immune response during infection.

Much has changed since March 2020, when the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a pandemic and clinicians around the world began desperately searching for therapies that could help afflicted patients. Barely 2.5 years after SARS-CoV-2 was discovered, we have solid evidence for the efficacy and safety of repurposed and novel agents for pre- and postexposure prophylaxis and for mild and severe disease, not to mention highly effective vaccines.

### Long-term side effects and lingering symptoms post COVID-19 recovery [^655f30c0]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Since the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), our understanding regarding the pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of this disease have been improving. However, we still have limited data on long-term effects and lingering symptoms of post COVID-19 recovery. Despite predilection of COVID-19 for lungs, multiple extra-pulmonary manifestations appear in multiple organs and biological systems and with continued infection and recovery worldwide. It is necessary that clinicians provide patients with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection with expectations of long-term effects during or after recovery from COVID-19. Herein, we review the long-term impact of COVID-19 on different organ systems reported from different clinical studies. Understanding risk factors and signs and symptoms of long-term consequences after recovery from COVID-19 will allow for proper follow-up and management of the disease post recovery.

### Characteristics and predictors of acute and chronic post-COVID syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^35d79a2a]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Varied terminology (e.g. ‘long COVID’, and ‘post-COVID syndrome’) have contributed to heterogenous research; given the adoption of the latter by NICE guidelines, widespread adoption of the term ‘post-COVID syndrome’ is required to aid homogenisation of future symptom data, allowing predictors to be accurately described. The introduction of clinical codes for chronic post-COVID syndrome may aid identification of cases from administrative clinical datasets. Moreover, prospectively designed trials with appropriate control arms are required (including low- and middle-income countries) to establish relationships between post-COVID syndrome and i) age, particularly as several studies excluded elderly populations which are most at risk of severe symptoms; ii) ethnicity status; and iii) characteristics and severity of initial acute infection (e.g. requirement of intensive care, need for supplemental oxygen).

In conclusion, the applicability of current knowledge on post-COVID syndrome is limited by the quality of available data, a result of the flaws in data capture and interpretation, as demonstrated in the uncertainty of our meta-analysis and there is need for global collaboration to further understand the prevalence, clinical characteristics, and prognosis of this novel disease. Clinicians, policy makers, and researchers must focus on understanding the impact of this condition on individuals and society.

### Epidemiology and organ specific sequelae of post-acute COVID19: a narrative review [^5be16e90]. The Journal of Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

"Long COVID", a term coined by COVID-19 survivors, describes persistent or new symptoms in a subset of patients who have recovered from acute illness. Globally, the population of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 continues to expand rapidly, necessitating the need for a more thorough understanding of the array of potential sequelae of COVID-19. The multisystemic aspects of acute COVID-19 have been the subject of intense investigation, but the long-term complications remain poorly understood. Emerging data from lay press, social media, commentaries, and emerging scientific reports suggest that some COVID-19 survivors experience organ impairment and/or debilitating chronic symptoms, at times protean in nature, which impact their quality of life.

Methods/Results

In this review, by addressing separately each body system, we describe the pleiotropic manifestations reported post COVID-19, their putative pathophysiology and risk factors, and attempt to offer guidance regarding work-up, follow-up and management strategies. Long term sequelae involve all systems with a negative impact on mental health, well-being and quality of life, while a subset of patients, report debilitating chronic fatigue, with or without other fluctuating or persistent symptoms, such as pain or cognitive dysfunction. Although the pathogenesis is unclear, residual damage from acute infection, persistent immune activation, mental factors, or unmasking of underlying co-morbidities are considered as drivers. Comparing long COVID with other post viral chronic syndromes may help to contextualize the complex somatic and emotional sequalae of acute COVID-19. The pace of recovery of different aspects of the syndrome remains unclear as the pandemic began only a year ago.

Conclusions

Early recognition of long-term effects and thorough follow-up through dedicated multidisciplinary outpatient clinics with a carefully integrated research agenda are essential for treating COVID-19 survivors holistically.

### Long COVID trajectories in the prospectively followed RECOVER-adult US cohort [^fc6d14c9]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Long COVID was recently defined by a National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine committee as an infection-associated chronic condition that occurs after SARS-CoV-2 infection and is present for at least 3 months as a continuous, relapsing and remitting, or progressive disease state that affects one or more organ systems,. This definition incorporates the possibilities of several distinct trajectories for Long COVID, yet these trajectories remain poorly defined. Millions of patients have experienced Long COVID, with a prevalence in adults estimated to be approximately 6% post-infection, with roughly a quarter of those with Long COVID experiencing significant activity limitations,. Patients experience Long COVID as a wide range of symptoms of variable severity with an unpredictable clinical course. In addition, healthcare providers face significant diagnostic challenges because many Long COVID symptoms are non-specific and can be present in uninfected persons or recovered SARS-CoV-2-infected patients without clear evidence of Long COVID. There is an urgent need to define the differing Long COVID trajectories to inform clinical trials and other investigations into the pathogenesis and treatment of persistent symptoms, as well as to determine the resources required for clinical and public health support of individuals with Long COVID and their providers.

To address this important global health priority, the National Institutes of Health established the Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) initiative. The RECOVER Adult cohort includes a large subgroup of participants who were prospectively followed from the acute phase of their first SARS-CoV-2 infection, including participants who enrolled as uninfected and were infected during the study. To provide a rigorous assessment of disease presence and capture the heterogeneity of Long COVID-associated symptoms, a quantitative research index for Long COVID was developed based on specific self-reported symptoms using standardized questionnaires developed with input from patient representatives,. Here, using this index, we report Long COVID trajectories among the RECOVER Adult participants observed since acute infection, and describe the notable features and prevalence of these trajectories.

### Long-COVID: neurological manifestations and management [^63eaa9ed]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

At the time of writing there have been over 110 million reported cases of COVID-19 across the world, since the first reports emerged in December 2019. Although there have also been nearly 3 million related deaths, the majority of patients recover without sequelae. However, a proportion who recover from the acute infection develop more persistent symptoms which vary in severity, duration, and phenotype; a phenomenon now known as Long-COVID. The underlying pathogenesis of Long-COVID remains unclear, but clinical symptoms can be extensive, affect multiple organs, and may persist for many months after illness-onset. Neurological symptoms may be prominent in Long-COVID and neurologists, in common with other medical specialists, are likely to require an understanding of relevant symptoms to develop optimal management strategies and services. In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence defines Long-COVID as ‘signs and symptoms that continue or develop after acute COVID-19’. This includes both ongoing symptomatic COVID-19 (from 4 to 12 weeks post initial infection) and post-COVID-19 syndrome (12 weeks or more). In an effort to keep pace with published work, we review recently published studies on Long-COVID, with a focus on neurological features.

### Long COVID-ACOEM guidance statement [^65e1e467]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Long COVID—risk for persistent symptoms and clinical course—Persistent symptoms are more likely after severe illness, and patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) have higher risks of persistent symptoms including fatigue, chest tightness, anxiety, dyspnea, and myalgia. Patients with mild illness have a lower rate of ongoing symptoms most of which resolve within a year from diagnosis. Reinfection also carries an added risk for persistent symptoms.

### Postacute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection [^a676b4b2]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Postacute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or long coronavirus disease (COVID) is an emerging syndrome characterized by multiple persisting or newly emergent symptoms following the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection. For affected patients, these prolonged symptoms can have a relapsing and remitting course and may be associated with disability and frequent health care utilization. Although many symptom-driven treatments are available, management remains challenging and often requires a multidisciplinary approach. This article summarizes the emerging consensus on definitions, epidemiology, and pathophysiology of long COVID and discusses what is understood about prevention, evaluation, and treatment of this syndrome.

### Long COVID-ACOEM guidance statement [^356157e2]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Long COVID—prevalence and impairment in US adults—CDC Household Pulse Surveys indicate that approximately 15% of US adults reported ever having experienced long COVID symptoms, and in June 2023, 6% of US adults had long COVID, a decrease from 7.5% in June 2022. This overall prevalence includes adults who did not report having COVID-19. Among respondents indicating prior COVID-19, 11% reported ongoing long COVID symptoms, a decrease from 18.9% in 2022, and among those with long COVID, approximately 25% indicated significant impairment. By late 2022, it was estimated that 77% of adults in the United States had been infected with SARS-CoV-2, providing context for these estimates.

Holistic management principles for Long COVID—Current strategies focus primarily on symptom-based supportive care, emphasizing that it is essential to validate the patient’s experience and provide reassurance, tailor physical activity recommendations to the patient’s current activity tolerance because overly intense activity can trigger post-exertional malaise and worsened muscle damage, and deliver treatment recommendations with humility given many persistent unknowns and an evolving evidence base.

### A review of persistent post-COVID syndrome (PPCS) [^5dacae0c]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Persistent post-COVID syndrome, also referred to as long COVID, is a pathologic entity, which involves persistent physical, medical, and cognitive sequelae following COVID-19, including persistent immunosuppression as well as pulmonary, cardiac, and vascular fibrosis. Pathologic fibrosis of organs and vasculature leads to increased mortality and severely worsened quality of life. Inhibiting transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), an immuno- and a fibrosis modulator, may attenuate these post-COVID sequelae. Current preclinical and clinical efforts are centered on the mechanisms and manifestations of COVID-19 and its presymptomatic and prodromal periods; by comparison, the postdrome, which occurs in the aftermath of COVID-19, which we refer to as persistent post-COVID-syndrome, has received little attention. Potential long-term effects from post-COVID syndrome will assume increasing importance as a surge of treated patients are discharged from the hospital, placing a burden on healthcare systems, patients' families, and society in general to care for these medically devastated COVID-19 survivors. This review explores underlying mechanisms and possible manifestations of persistent post-COVID syndrome, and presents a framework of strategies for the diagnosis and management of patients with suspected or confirmed persistent post-COVID syndrome.

### Using the 2024 national academies of science, engineering, and medicine definition of long COVID: implications for pulmonary and critical care medicine [^a2c71337]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Various groups have proposed their own terminology and definitions to describe the longer-term adverse health effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including “post–COVID-19 syndrome” (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, United Kingdom), “post-COVID condition” (World Health Organization), and postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection or “PASC” (NIH Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery [RECOVER] Initiative, United States). A score-based definition of postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection was developed by the NIH RECOVER team in 2023 and updated in 2024, with the current definition relying on the “RECOVER-Adult Long COVID Research Index” based on 11 symptoms at 4.5 or more months after a first SARS-CoV-2 infection. The RECOVER team also developed different symptom indexes for children aged 6 to 11 years (10 symptoms) and for adolescents (8 symptoms).

More than 200 symptoms have been reported in association with long COVID, raising concerns that definitions proposed by the RECOVER team to improve specificity on the basis of a selective list of symptoms will unwittingly exclude some individuals with significant chronic health impairments after SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the absence of validated biomarkers (a limitation of the current state of science), use of selective symptom lists would also limit the ability of individuals with chronic sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 to successfully apply for disability benefits or contribute to further research for patients with long COVID. In addition, some groups have proposed long COVID as a diagnosis of exclusion, which does not consider the biologic plausibility that infection with SARS-CoV-2 may exacerbate preexisting illnesses. The minimum duration of symptoms to diagnose long COVID is also highly variable across definitions (e.g. 3 mo, 2 mo, no specific duration). The lack of consensus about the terminology and definition has been a barrier to clinical care and has slowed research in long COVID.

### Postacute sequelae of severe acute Respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection: a state-of-the-art review [^7206b55d]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2021). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, has created unprecedented challenges for public health and health care infrastructures around the world. As of June 18, 2021, there have been more than 177 million cases of COVID-19 worldwide, including 33 million in the United States, resulting in more than 3.8 million deaths globally and 600,000 deaths in the United States. Despite ongoing vaccination efforts, COVID-19 continues to spread around the world, driven by emergent variant strains and relaxation of prevention/mitigation strategies. With >99% of patients surviving the acute infectious period and data on the long-term sequelae of COVID-19 disease beginning to emerge, there is an urgent need to better understand the lasting effects of COVID-19 on survivors. These long-term complications, collectively referred to as the postacute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection (PASC) and more colloquially as “long COVID” or “long haulers,” span multiple systems and may have significant effects on health, function status, and quality of life.

In this review, we summarize and synthesize the emerging evidence about symptoms and conditions comprising PASC, characterize what is known about the frequency and timing of their occurrence, and seek to identify individuals at highest risk. In the context of constrained resources and structural disparities within the US health care system, this review has several key objectives. First, it will help patients, clinicians, and health systems understand the epidemiology of PASC to inform timely evidence-based screening, diagnosis, and treatment and anticipate the resources required to care for patients with increasing burden of chronic health conditions. Second, it will be informative for payers as they anticipate resource use, costs of care, and consider optimal disease management, risk mitigation, and payment models. Lastly, it may help federal and state governments and public health agencies to coordinate their responses and ameliorate disparities in health care access, utilization, and health outcomes.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^a07a2400]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Holistic assessment and ICD-10 coding for Long COVID—Long COVID can present as a wide variety of symptoms, either in isolation or more often in clusters, and when one or more of these symptoms occur a holistic assessment should include a traditional history, physical examination, and additional diagnostic testing, as indicated; a basic laboratory assessment is recommended for all patients with possible Long COVID, with additional labs and diagnostic procedures guided by patients’ specific symptoms. When a patient is assessed to likely be presenting with sequelae of Long COVID, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis code of “U09.9 Post COVID-19 Condition, unspecified” should be documented as a secondary code and the primary ICD-10 code(s) should reflect the patient’s specific presenting symptom(s) and condition(s); systematic inclusion of the U09.9 code facilitates population-level monitoring of Long COVID sequelae, and the U09.9 diagnosis code is not appropriate to use in cases of acute COVID-19 infection.

### Treatment (...) [^65b21de9]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

This article summarizes the best available evidence for the diagnosis and management of postacute sequelae of COVID-19, also called long COVID, in adults. Proposed etiologies for long COVID include residual damage from acute infection, ongoing viral activity within an intrahost viral reservoir, complications from a hyperinflammatory state, immune dysfunction, and unmasking of preexisting health conditions. 1, 2. ○ Phase
3. Long COVID may develop and can last for months. 1–4 A 2022 study identified type 2 diabetes mellitus, SARS-CoV-2 viremia, Epstein-Barr virus viremia, and specific autoantibodies as risk factors for long COVID. 11Additional risk factors suggested by other studies include age older than 50 years, female sex, more severe acute infection, more than five symptoms in the first week of acute infection, immunosuppressive conditions, underlying health conditions, and partial or no vaccination. 12–17.

In a large community-based sample, the risk of long COVID in fully vaccinated individuals with breakthrough COVID-19 is less than in partially or unvaccinated individuals. 14, 18 Patients with long COVID report decreased quality of life on standardized testing.
17. Patients with cognitive impairment as a result of long COVID should be referred to a specialist with expertise in formal cognitive assessment and remediation. 38 Clinicians should address polypharmacy and, if possible, discontinue medications that may impact cognition. 38 Patients with ongoing cough and dyspnea may benefit from breathing exercises that focus on optimal body position and posture, pulmonary rehabilitation for pulmonary disease, and a phased return to activity program.

Prognosis Most patients can expect gradual improvement in functional status with a relapsing and remitting course, aided by careful pacing, prioritization, and goal setting. 3, 24 Although many individuals may experience resolution of some or all symptoms over time, the ultimate long-term prognosis of long COVID is unclear. 24, 46 Clinicians should set expectations for patients, advising that there are varying outcomes and rates of recovery. 1 One study found a progressive decline in the average number of symptoms after seven months; however, 65. 2% of patients still had symptoms after six months. Those with continued postexertional malaise experienced a higher number of average symptoms.

### On setting expectations for a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine [^bb869ec8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The global coronavirus pandemic is unlike any other since 1918. A century of dramatic medical advances has produced a public expectation that the medical field will rapidly provide solutions to restore normalcy. In less than 6 months, since severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified, the massive international effort to develop a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine has generated more than 140 vaccines in different stages of development, with 9 already recruiting into clinical trials posted on ClinicalTrials.gov. The long-term strategy to handle coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) will almost certainly rely on vaccines. But what type of protection can we realistically expect to achieve from vaccines and when?

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^0d5d7136]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Long COVID compendium statement—In 2021 the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation established a multidisciplinary collaborative to provide guidance from Long COVID clinics and previously published eight consensus guidance statements using a primarily symptom-based approach; recognizing that symptoms often do not occur in isolation, this compendium aims to equip clinicians with an efficient, up-to-date resource for evaluating and managing adults with Long COVID. The intended audience includes physiatrists, primary care physicians, and other clinicians who provide first-line assessment and management, especially where subspecialty care is not readily available, and the compendium provides a holistic framework, symptom-specific considerations, and updates on prevalence, health equity, disability, pathophysiology, and emerging treatments; because Long COVID closely resembles infection-associated chronic conditions (IACCs) such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, the guidance may also be helpful for related conditions. Methods state that guidance was developed using the collaborative’s established modified Delphi approach.

### Burdens of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 by severity of acute infection, demographics and health status [^5e166813]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Here we estimate that the overall burden of PASC (long covid) beyond the first 30 days of illness is around 7%, (4.4%, 21.7%, and 36.5% among non-hospitalized, hospitalized, and those admitted to intensive care, respectively). The estimates were slightly lower but remained substantial using an alternative definition accounting for burden beyond first 12 weeks of illness (6% in overall cohort, and 4.1%, 15.8%, 22.7% in non-hospitalized, hospitalized, and those admitted to intensive care, respectively).

To date, most studies on long covid did not include a control group or simply focused mostly on people who were hospitalized; fewer studies reported burden of long covid in non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19 –. Nevertheless, the evidence from the totality of studies accumulated thus far generally places the burden of long covid at around 4–10% –. Most importantly, it is now compellingly evident that while burden of PASC (or long covid) is most pronounced in people with poorer baseline health and those who had severe acute infection, the burden of PASC (or long covid) is substantial (and non-trivial) among non-hospitalized individuals (who represent the majority of people with COVID-19)—this potentially may translate into millions of people affected in the US and globally.

The implications of our results are clear. As the number of COVID-19 cases continues to climb across the globe, health systems face the dual challenge of coping with surges in acute infections, and caring for COVID-19 survivors (now accounting for more than 2% of the global population and growing) who will also likely require substantial care to mitigate permanent health loss. This will place additional demand on already strained health systems. Governments and health systems around the globe should be actively devising plans to address the tide of COVID-19 survivors in need of post-COVID-19 care. Our estimates of the burden of PASC (around 7% of infected people) and burden of 33 individual sequelae by age, race, sex, and baseline health status may help inform capacity planning and optimal composition of multidisciplinary post-COVID-19 clinics.

### Long-term effects of COVID-19 on the cardiopulmonary system in adults and children: current status and questions to be resolved by the National Institutes of Health researching COVID to enhance recovery initiative [^e93d5f08]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Topic Importance

Long COVID may occur in at least 10% of patients recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection and often is associated with debilitating symptoms. Among the organ systems that might be involved in its pathogenesis, the respiratory and cardiovascular systems may be central to common symptoms seen in survivors of COVID-19, including fatigue, dyspnea, chest pain, cough, and exercise intolerance. Understand the exact symptomatology, causes, and effects of long COVID on the heart and lungs may help us to discover new therapies. To that end, the National Institutes of Health is sponsoring a national study population of diverse volunteers to support large-scale studies on the long-term effects of COVID-19.

Review Findings

The National Institutes of Health Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) initiative currently is recruiting participants in the United States to answer critical questions about long COVID. The study comprises adult and pediatric cohorts as well as an electronic health record cohort. Based on symptoms, individuals undergo prespecified medical testing to understand whether abnormalities can be detected and are followed up longitudinally. Herein, we outline current understanding of the clinical symptoms and pathophysiologic features of long COVID with respect to the cardiopulmonary system in adults and children and then determine how the clinical, electronic health record, and autopsy cohorts of the RECOVER initiative will attempt to answer the most pressing questions surrounding the long-term effects of COVID-19.

Summary

Data generated from the RECOVER initiative will provide guidance about missing gaps in our knowledge about long COVID and how they might be filled by data gathered through the RECOVER initiative.

### Studying the post-COVID-19 condition: research challenges, strategies, and importance of core outcome set development [^fa6a46b3]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has necessitated rapid responses from healthcare systems and research networks globally. Although a large amount of comprehensive data on acute symptoms and clinical management has been collected and analysed, there are currently no established clinical definition or Core Outcome Sets (COS). Indeed, even the terminology of the condition is debated with variable terms and definitions for the post-COVID-19 condition including long COVID, “long haulers”, post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), or post-COVID-19 condition, the term used by the World Health Organization (WHO). With over 217 million confirmed COVID-19 cases globally, post-COVID-19 condition risks affecting millions of people worldwide, making it an urgent research priority. Although wide-scale vaccination may eventually lead to a decline in the number of COVID-19 cases, with cases rising worldwide, the pandemic is far from over. There is an urgent need for consensus on critically important core outcomes to be measured in post-COVID-19 condition. Establishing a COS will ensure that critically important outcomes are measured and reported in a consistent manner in research and practice settings. The consistent use of the most important outcomes across studies and clinical practice is essential to compare and collate the research findings with translation into clinical recommendations for patient care.

In this manuscript, we discuss the existing data known about post-COVID-19 condition research following WHO’s systematic approach to identifying research gaps with the principal purpose of suggesting and outlining the implementation of a COS for the post-COVID-19 condition (i) to allow for the assessment of outcomes which are of the greatest relevance and importance to stakeholders and relevant target populations including patients, families, clinicians, researchers, health systems, public health policymakers, industry, and funding organisations; (ii) to improve the consistency and quality of data collection; and (iii) to build a foundation for data sharing for pooled analysis for meta-analysis and comparison of results across studies and global regions.

Given the current immediate need for an accepted post-COVID-19 condition COS, the development of a COS for the post-COVID-19 condition could act as a guide over the next few years until more is known and/or review or reassessment is indicated.

### Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome [^6f49aed3]. Nature Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogen responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has resulted in global healthcare crises and strained health resources. As the population of patients recovering from COVID-19 grows, it is paramount to establish an understanding of the healthcare issues surrounding them. COVID-19 is now recognized as a multi-organ disease with a broad spectrum of manifestations. Similarly to post-acute viral syndromes described in survivors of other virulent coronavirus epidemics, there are increasing reports of persistent and prolonged effects after acute COVID-19. Patient advocacy groups, many members of which identify themselves as long haulers, have helped contribute to the recognition of post-acute COVID-19, a syndrome characterized by persistent symptoms and/or delayed or long-term complications beyond 4weeks from the onset of symptoms. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the current literature on post-acute COVID-19, its pathophysiology and its organ-specific sequelae. Finally, we discuss relevant considerations for the multidisciplinary care of COVID-19 survivors and propose a framework for the identification of those at high risk for post-acute COVID-19 and their coordinated management through dedicated COVID-19 clinics.

### Challenges to delivering evidence-based management for long COVID [^2e352faa]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Early on in the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists forewarned of a potential medium to long-term post-acute sequelae in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, similar to that documented in bacterial,protozoan and viral infections including Epstein-Barr virus,Ebola virus,dengue virus,Chikunguña virus,going far back to the influenza pandemic in 1918.These varied symptoms following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection is now termed as long COVID and is also known as long-haulers syndrome, post COVID-19 condition (PCC),‘post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC)’,‘chronic COVID’ and many other terms. The Department of Health and Human Services in collaboration with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention broadly defines long COVID as ‘signs, symptoms, and conditions that continue or develop after initial COVID-19 infection’.Through a global consensus, the WHO, in October 2021, defined post COVID-19 condition as ‘the presence of symptoms usually 3 months from the onset of COVID-19 with symptoms that last for at least 2 months and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis’.In February 2023, the WHO issued a new definition for post COVID-19 in children and adolescents.Endorsing the definition by WHO, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) was developed and classified this condition as ‘Diagnosis Code U09.9 (Post COVID-19 condition, unspecified)’.

### Management of locally advanced rectal cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic: a necessary paradigm change at memorial sloan kettering cancer center [^c51e70e9]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic will consume significant health care resources. Given the concerns for rapidly increasing infection rates in the United States, impending staffing shortages, and the potential for resource reallocation, we rapidly reevaluated our rectal cancer practice policies during this public health emergency. Before the pandemic, we commonly used total neoadjuvant therapy with a strong preference for long-course chemoradiation. In the setting of the ongoing pandemic, we now mandate short-course radiation therapy (SCRT). Despite multiple randomized trials demonstrating no difference in locoregional recurrence, distant recurrence, or overall survival between SCRT and long-course chemoradiation, the adaptation of SCRT in the United States has been low given concerns for less tumor downstaging and increased toxicity. In the setting of the ongoing and likely prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, we feel that these concerns must be reevaluated, because SCRT presents a well-validated alternative that will allow us to meet the needs of a greater number of potentially curable patients at a time when resources are severely and acutely constrained.

### Post-COVID-19 condition: clinical phenotypes, pathophysiological mechanisms, pathology, and management strategies [^d85b81a8]. The Journal of Pathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), driven by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), has had a lasting impact on human well‐being and global healthcare over the past years. Although significant strides have been made to combat acute COVID‐19, now considered endemic, some survivors go on to develop lingering symptoms long after acute infection, a condition widely known as ‘Post‐COVID‐19 condition’ (PCC) or ‘long COVID’. Other common terms used to describe long‐term health effects of COVID‐19 include ‘post‐acute sequelae of SARS‐CoV‐2 (PASC)’, ‘post‐acute COVID‐19 syndrome (PCS)’, or ‘long haulers syndrome’. The definitions of PCC are broad, complicating efforts to capture the diverse manifestations of the condition comprehensively. Referring to specific syndromes rather than the general term PCC would likely improve its understandibility. The World Health Organization adopted the term PCC to describe long‐term symptoms persisting or newly emerging at least 3 months following acute SARS‐CoV‐2 infection that continue for at least 2 months without any other identifiable cause. The condition is a clinical diagnosis due to the lack of definitive laboratory tests or established biomarkers.

PCC can present with a wide range of symptoms – over 200 have been identified – that are multiple organ system‐specific, affecting, among others, the nervous, respiratory, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, and urinary organ systems. Common clinical symptoms include dyspnoea, fatigue, and cognitive dysfunction (also known as ‘brain fog’). These symptoms can fluctuate over time, but often disrupt daily life. Individuals particularly at risk of developing PCC include the elderly, females, those who are not (or insufficiently) vaccinated, individuals who experienced severe acute COVID‐19 requiring hospitalisation, and those with (multiple) comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, and obesity. These comorbidities can, individually or in combination, exacerbate or be exacerbated by PCC. However, PCC can affect individuals of all ages, genders, and ethnicities, including those who were previously healthy, vaccinated, and had only mild initial SARS‐CoV‐2 infections. In fact, since the majority of individuals with acute COVID‐19 were not hospitalised, most people with PCC had only mild initial illness. The reasons why some people fully recover from COVID‐19 while others develop PCC remain unclear.

1 INTRODUCTION

Although more than 90% of those with coronavirus 2019 (COVID‐19) survive, the proportion who are fully recovered 3−12 months after the initial infection is varied, as are the types and frequencies of residual sequelae. As initial infection severity might alter symptom persistence and most SARS‐CoV‐2 infected persons are never hospitalized, the paucity of long‐term outpatient data is especially salient.

Introduction

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has profoundly impacted global health and economies since its emergence in late 2019,. Although vaccination efforts have substantially reduced the severity and mortality rates associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the emergence of variants continues to challenge vaccine efficacy, necessitating ongoing vigilance and adaptable public health strategies. Moreover, beyond the acute phase, the long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, collectively termed post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) or long COVID, have emerged as a pressing global health concern,.

PASC is characterized by persistent symptoms that can last for weeks or months after the initial infection. These symptoms include fatigue, respiratory issues, cognitive dysfunction and a general decline in quality of life. The complexity and variability of PASC symptoms have made it challenging to develop standardized treatments, leaving many patients without effective management options. With the growing population of COVID-19 survivors, the burden of PASC is expected to escalate, underscoring the urgent need for mechanistic research and targeted interventions. Despite substantial progress, most PASC studies rely on clinical data from minimally invasive samples, such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF),. These studies often lack multitissue analysis and are limited by inconsistent timing for symptom assessments, complicating cross-study comparisons and slowing the development of effective therapies. Thus, a more comprehensive, multitissue approach, incorporating single-cell resolution and standardized analysis time points, is essential to uncover the cellular and molecular pathways driving PASC.

### COVID-19 and cancer research [^13fc2162]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Main

COVID-19 has had a major impact on everything we do, but in this editorial, I will consider the cancer field. Cancer patients are at the forefront of risk from COVID-19 and have a disproportionately high death rate. Clearly, some of these factors relate to immune suppression and chemotherapy, which means the relative risks of treatment versus death from coronavirus versus infection need to be carefully balanced. Also, the need for isolation of patients and delivery of treatment is a problem, particularly intravenous and intramuscular injections. This has led to prioritisation lists, ranking from the most curable, to those least likely to benefit. No trial therapies can be used, as all trials are stopped for cancer therapy. Highly innovative clinical trials of advanced cellular therapies, such as tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and chimaeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells, will be particularly adversely affected as these also often require input from critical care/intensive therapy unit (ITU). There will also be consequences on survival for those patients treated with curative intent for whom critical care is often required to deliver their treatment (e.g. major thoracic surgery or oesophagectomy and bone marrow transplantation in haemato-oncology), and which has been delayed due to de-prioritisation as ITU has been focused on the COVID-19 pandemic.

### SARS-CoV-2 reservoir in post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) [^13094bd9]. Nature Immunology (2023). High credibility.

Millions of people are suffering from Long COVID or post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). Several biological factors have emerged as potential drivers of PASC pathology. Some individuals with PASC may not fully clear the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 after acute infection. Instead, replicating virus and/or viral RNA-potentially capable of being translated to produce viral proteins-persist in tissue as a 'reservoir'. This reservoir could modulate host immune responses or release viral proteins into the circulation. Here we review studies that have identified SARS-CoV-2 RNA/protein or immune responses indicative of a SARS-CoV-2 reservoir in PASC samples. Mechanisms by which a SARS-CoV-2 reservoir may contribute to PASC pathology, including coagulation, microbiome and neuroimmune abnormalities, are delineated. We identify research priorities to guide the further study of a SARS-CoV-2 reservoir in PASC, with the goal that clinical trials of antivirals or other therapeutics with potential to clear a SARS-CoV-2 reservoir are accelerated.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^37066d7f]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Long COVID—disability benefits and clinician documentation guidance note that either short-term or long-term disability benefits may be considered, whereas Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) pays benefits only for long-term disability and requires that the disabling condition must have lasted, or is expected to last, at least 1 year or result in death. The clinician has a limited, yet crucial, role in a patient’s disability application process, and the clinician’s responsibility is to document the patient’s reported symptoms, any objective signs and/or abnormal test results supporting severity, and any impairments related to Long COVID that substantially limit work duties and major life activities; routine use of validated patient-reported symptom measures can be helpful to document persistence over time. It is also noted that it is possible for a patient to work a small amount while receiving SSDI benefits, and that documenting the expected timeline of recovery, or lack thereof, is also critical.

### Clinical overview of long COVID (...) [^35b2aa7c]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Long COVID is an infection-associated chronic condition that affects one or more organ systems.
- Primary care providers can manage Long COVID using patient-centered approaches.
- Objective laboratory or imaging findings should not be used as the only measure or assessment of a patient's well-being.
- Healthcare providers should set achievable patient care goals through shared decision-making and approach treatment by focusing on specific symptoms or conditions.
- Healthcare providers can help patients with Long COVID by validating their symptoms and connecting them to additional care, services, and supports, as appropriate.
- Providers should promote COVID-19 vaccines as a means of preventing Long COVID.

Introduction to Long COVID Long COVID, also known as Post-COVID Conditions, is an infection-associated chronic condition that can occur after SARS-CoV-2 infection, the virus that causes COVID-19, and is present for at least 3 months as a continuous, relapsing and remitting, or progressive disease state that affects one or more organ systems.
1. The definition for Long COVID will continue to be evaluated as data are collected, analyzed, and reported and our understanding of the chronic condition improves. Most patients appear to recover from their initial acute COVID-19 illness within 4 weeks, and many patients continue to recover between 4 and 12 weeks. Long COVID is associated with: . Documenting SARS-CoV-2 infection and Long COVID, also referred to as Post-COVID Conditions, is critical for accurate public health surveillance and may help patients receive needed care.

Treatment and symptom management For most patients, the goal of medical management of Long COVID is to optimize function and quality of life through established symptom management approaches, which may include:
- Focusing on the most bothersome symptoms identified by the patient.
- Creating a comprehensive rehabilitation plan.
- Optimizing management of underlying medical conditions.
- Creating patient diaries and calendars to document changes in health conditions and symptom severity. Managing post-exertional malaise PEM is commonly associated with Long COVID and is the worsening of symptoms following even minor physical or mental exertion, with symptoms typically worsening 12 to 48 hours after activity and lasting for days or even weeks. Patients may take specific steps to mitigate PEM. Treatment of Long COVID should be tailored to a patient's specific symptoms or conditions, including FDA-approved or over-the-counter medications.

Holistic support for the patient throughout their illness can also be beneficial. Healthcare providers play a significant role in supporting their patients and can further help patients with Long COVID by: .

### Post-covid syndrome in individuals admitted to hospital with COVID-19: retrospective cohort study [^6c30b343]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

In the early stages of the covid-19 pandemic, the estimated infection rate of SARS-CoV-2 in the United Kingdom was 6% (13% in London).Research, health services, and the media have mostly focused on direct (through infection) and indirect (through changes in individual behaviours and health systems) effects of covid-19 on mortality,particularly in the short term.Studies of the longer term effects on morbidity are needed to effectively plan healthcare delivery and capacity.

Since SARS-CoV-2 infection was recognised in late 2019, the academic and clinical emphasis has been on respiratory manifestations.Increasing evidence exists for direct multiorgan effects,however, and indirect effects on other organ systems and disease processes, such as cardiovascular diseases and cancers, through changes in healthcare delivery and patient behaviours.Although the long term effects of covid-19 on individuals and health systems are becoming clear, investigation across organ systems is urgently needed.

Long covid, or post-covid syndrome, is not one condition, and is defined by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as “signs and symptoms that develop during or after an infection consistent with covid-19 which continue for more than 12 weeks and are not explained by an alternative diagnosis.”NICE guidelines recommend referral to post-covid syndrome assessment clinics if post-covid symptoms persist for 6-12 weeks.Pre-existing conditions and risk factors are predictors of acute covid-19 outcomes (such as admission to the intensive care unit and mortality), but the epidemiology of post-covid syndrome has been less well definedbecause of the unclear medium and long term pathophysiology across organ systems. When post-covid syndrome clinics are established, characterisation of the epidemiology of the disease will help with appropriate diagnosis, care, public health interventions and policy, and resource planning.

### Long COVID trajectories in the prospectively followed RECOVER-adult US cohort [^0d9055f9]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Longitudinal trajectories of Long COVID remain ill-defined, yet are critically needed to advance clinical trials, patient care, and public health initiatives for millions of individuals with this condition. Long COVID trajectories were determined prospectively among 3,659 participants (69% female; 99.6% Omicron era) in the National Institutes of Health Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) Adult Cohort. Finite mixture modeling was used to identify distinct longitudinal profiles based on a Long COVID research index measured 3 to 15 months after infection. Eight longitudinal profiles were identified. Overall, 195 (5%) had persistently high Long COVID symptom burden, 443 (12%) had non-resolving, intermittently high symptom burden, and 526 (14%) did not meet criteria for Long COVID at 3 months but had increasing symptoms by 15 months, suggestive of distinct pathophysiologic features. At 3 months, 377 (10%) met the research index threshold for Long COVID. Of these, 175 (46%) had persistent Long COVID, 132 (35%) had moderate symptoms, and 70 (19%) appeared to recover. Identification of these Long COVID symptom trajectories is critically important for targeting enrollment for future studies of pathophysiologic mechanisms, preventive strategies, clinical trials and treatments.

### Characteristics and predictors of acute and chronic post-COVID syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^eea4a32f]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

2 Methods

2.1 Design

This systematic review was conducted in accordance to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The review was registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO ID: CRD42020222855).

2.2 Research questions

This review sought to answer the following questions:
(1) What are the clinical features associated with acute and chronic post-COVID syndrome?
(2) Which features predict the development of post-COVID syndrome?

2.3 Search Strategy and databases

A systematic search, with expert librarian support, was performed using electronic databases through Ovid in Medline, EMBASE, health management information consortium (HMIC), and PsycINFO databases without language restriction. The search was conducted using a list of terms relating to COVID-19 and persistent symptoms; the complete search strategy is available in Appendix 1. Further studies not captured by the search were identified through bibliometric cross-referencing. Grey literature was additionally searched.

All identified studies were uploaded to Covidence (Melbourne, Australia), a Cochrane supported systematic review package tool. Initial screening was conducted by two investigators (FI and KL) to determine if the eligibility criteria were met. Discrepancies resolved by discussion. Studies meeting the inclusion criteria underwent full-text screening; supplemental references were scrutinised for additional relevant articles.

2.4 Study selection criteria and outcome measures

The inclusion criteria for study selection were focussed on studies describing ‘long-COVID’ or ‘post-COVID syndrome’, the incidence of reported symptoms and predictors. The last search was performed in March 2021. No language restrictions were placed.

Given the rapidly expanding literature surrounding COVID-19, a wide range of publications were included, (e.g. feature articles). Studies detailing a follow-up period shorter than 21 days; case series and articles focussing on other non-COVID-19 related conditions were excluded.

2.5 Data extraction

Outcome measures were the prevalence of symptoms indicative of acute and chronic post-COVID syndrome.

All included study characteristics and outcome measures were independently extracted by two investigators (FI and KL) with consensus achieved. All full text reports of studies identified as potentially eligible after title and abstract review were obtained for further review.

COVID-19, a highly transmissible pandemic disease, is affecting millions of lives around the world. Severely infected patients show acute respiratory distress symptoms. Sustainable management strategies are required to save lives of the infected people and further preventing spread of the virus. Diagnosis, treatment, and vaccination development initiatives are already exhibited from the scientific community to fight against this virus. In this review, we primarily discuss the management strategies including prevention of spread, prophylaxis, vaccinations, and treatment for COVID-19. Further, analysis of vaccine development status and performance are also briefly discussed. Global socioeconomic impact of COVID-19 is also analyzed as part of this review.

Discussion

At the outset of the pandemic, our clinical staff reviewed current and upcoming patients and designated them into three tiered priority levels, as previously detailed.Level 1 patients were deemed the highest priority to continue therapy, including patients who had already started treatment courses, those with highly symptomatic metastatic disease, or those with rapidly progressing potentially curable cancer. The policy indicated that patients who convert to COVID-19–positive or PUI status would need to be placed on a treatment break unless there was an urgent indication for treatment. Based on the institutional policy, that treatment break duration for COVID-19 patients would at minimum be 10 to 14 days or require 2 consecutive negative tests before clearance from precautions. This policy, though certainly necessary at the time, placed a burden on the treating physician to make difficult and ultimately subjective decisions about patient care and threatened the pillars of patient autonomy and mutual decision making.

SARS was eventually contained by means of syndromic surveillance, prompt isolation of patients, strict enforcement of quarantine of all contacts, and in some areas top-down enforcement of community quarantine. By interrupting all human-to-human transmission, SARS was effectively eradicated. By contrast, by Feb 28, 2020, within a matter of 2 months since the beginning of the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), more than 82000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported with more than 2800 deaths. Although there are striking similarities between SARS and COVID-19, the differences in the virus characteristics will ultimately determine whether the same measures for SARS will also be successful for COVID-19. COVID-19 differs from SARS in terms of infectious period, transmissibility, clinical severity, and extent of community spread. Even if traditional public health measures are not able to fully contain the outbreak of COVID-19, they will still be effective in reducing peak incidence and global deaths. Exportations to other countries need not result in rapid large-scale outbreaks, if countries have the political will to rapidly implement countermeasures.

### Characteristics and predictors of acute and chronic post-COVID syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^be966c1c]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

As of 4 th February 2021, SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 70 million individuals globally and has directly attributed to over 1.6 million deaths. While hospitals continue to grapple with the challenges of acute COVID-19, there is evidence to suggest the emergence of an associated secondary syndrome, labelled as either post-COVID or long-COVID syndrome, in which recovering SARS-CoV-2 patients suffer from persistent and, often, debilitating symptoms extending several months past their initial diagnosis,,.

In contrast to the scientific community's rapidly developing understanding of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterisation of post-COVID syndrome remains sparse. It is suggested that upwards of 20% of SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals go on to develop post-COVID syndrome. Its inception stems from a collective created through patients sharing a more complex course of recovery from their acute illness on social media platforms. This was given further traction with healthcare professionals recovering and sharing similar experiences; it has enveloped to incorporate broader patient perspectives of recovery, extending beyond a negative test result for COVID-19, encompassing a cohort of individuals who did not require hospitalisation but suffer morbidity. As such, there is an urgent medical, financial and societal need to understand the survivorship burden associated with this phenomenon,,.

Of note, there is a particular lack of understanding as to whether post-COVID syndrome constitutes a singular disease process. It has been suggested that the post-COVID syndrome may be characterised into either an acute or chronic subtype, depending on whether symptoms extend beyond 12 weeks following initial diagnosis. However, it is not currently understood as to whether chronic post-COVID is either an extension of acute post-COVID or is a separate disease subtype that carries a distinct risk profile. Clearly delineating the clinical features between post-COVID subtypes could prove to be a crucial step in (i) empowering clinicians to accurately diagnose post-COVID in the patients that they manage in both primary and secondary care settings, (ii) counselling patients on how to manage their particular syndrome subtypes as well as (iii) ensuring appropriate resource allocation in order to cater for the specific health and social care needs associated with each subtype cohort. Moreover, these goals could be further supplemented by the prospective identification of patients who are at highest risk of developing post-COVID syndrome of any description, who may benefit from enhanced surveillance programmes upon discharge from hospital.

### All together to fight COVID-19 [^e7145f68]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), named a pandemic by the WHO, is the current global health crisis. National and international collaboration are indispensable for combating COVID-19 and other similar potential outbreaks. International efforts to tackle this complex problem have led to remarkable scientific advances. Yet, as a global society, we can and must take additional measures to fight this pandemic. Undoubtedly, our approach toward COVID-19 was not perfect, and testing has not been deployed fast enough to arrest the epidemic early on. It is critical that we revise our approaches to be more prepared for pandemics as a united body by promoting global cooperation and commitment.

Long COVID and epidemiology of cardiac symptoms

The term ‘long COVID’ was originally coined by a patient, and asserts the notion that suffering does not stop with resolution of acute infection. While there is no universally accepted definition, in December 2020 the United Kingdom (UK) National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelinesdefined long COVID as persistence of symptoms beyond 4 weeks of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This term comprises two phases: ongoing symptomatic phase (4–12 weeks) and post-COVID-19 syndrome (>12 weeks) based on the duration of symptoms. More recently, the World Health Organization provided a case definition for post-COVID-19 condition,a term used to refer to persistence of symptoms beyond 3 months of SARS-CoV-2 infection, lasting for at least 2 months and not explained by any other illness. Other terms used to describe long COVID include post-acute COVID-19 syndrome,post-acute sequelae of COVID-19,and long-haul COVID.

Long COVID is a vacillating disease,characterized by a diverse range of symptoms spanning multiple organ systems, as depicted in Figure 1 and Graphical Abstract, and commonly includes fatigue, breathlessness, post-exertional malaise (PEM), brain fog, headaches, nausea, vomiting, anxiety, depression, skin rash, joint pain, and palpitations. Patient advocacy groups(e.g. long COVID SOS, COVID Advocacy Exchange, the National Patient Advocate Foundation COVID Care Resource Center, long-haul COVID fighters, Body Politic COVID-19 Support Group) have enhanced our understanding of this disease by drawing our attention to its multifaceted nature. Several experts, have noted its marked similarities with other post-viral symptoms (e.g. Epstein-Barr,human herpesvirus,influenza, SARS,and Ebola viruses), although few options exist for the management of such syndromes.

### Incidence of post-acute COVID-19 symptoms across healthcare settings in seven countries: an international retrospective cohort study using routinely-collected data [^4c1d1a4d]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, has significantly impacted public health worldwide.A major ongoing challenge is the post-COVID condition (PCC), also known as Long COVID.This condition is different from the acute phase of the illness. It involves a variety of symptoms that can last for months after the initial infection has cleared. Some of these symptoms might be completely new after recovery, while others could continue from the infection phase, often changing in intensity or reappearing over time.

Currently, PCC remains diagnosed with patient's subjective experiences or clinician observations, as there are no objective diagnostic markers or tests available. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in its ongoing review published in December 2020 outlines a timeline-based categorisation of COVID-19 symptoms, classifying those up to four weeks as acute and from four to twelve weeks as ongoing.Symptoms persisting beyond twelve weeks, in the absence of an alternate diagnosis, are considered indicative of PCC. Later, in December 2022, the World Health Organisation (WHO) adopted similar diagnostic principles and published a list of post-acute COVID-19 symptoms for the identification of patients, based on a Delphi expert consensus.

Understanding the population burden of patients experiencing post-acute COVID-19 symptoms is crucial, and has profound implications for treatment strategies, healthcare planning, and post-pandemic management.However, estimating the epidemiology is challenging, with earlier studies reporting prevalence rates ranging from 5% to 60%.This wide variation is attributed not only to the complex and dynamic nature of post-acute COVID-19 symptoms but also to differing methodologies in research and outcome definitions. Some studies rely on routinely collected health data from electronic medical records and health claims,, while others are based on patient self-reports. The temporal criterion for post-acute COVID-19 symptoms diagnosis also varies widely, with some studies considering periods as short as one-month post-infection, and others extending beyond a year.Furthermore, there is substantial inconsistency in the range of symptoms utilised, ranging from a focus on respiratory symptoms to encompassing multi-organ system involvement.

### Long-term sequelae of COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis of symptoms 3 years post-SARS-CoV-2 infection [^3d1a18fe]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection can lead to long‐lasting, persistent, and new symptoms occurring after the acute phase of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), known as long COVID or post‐acute sequelae of COVID‐19 (PASC). Similar long‐lasting health effects were also observed in the SARS epidemic in 2003 and at 1 year after hospital discharge, which 18% of patients had a significant reduction in distance walked in 6 min, 17% had not returned to work, and 33% reported a significant decrement in mental health. SARS infection in 2003 also resulted in persistent psychiatric morbidities and chronic fatigue among the survivors for up to 4 years of follow‐up. Even 15 years after SARS epidemic in 2003, 38% of infected patients still had reduced lung diffusion capacity. These reports indicate that long COVID from SARS‐CoV‐2 parallels the long‐term effects seen in the SARS epidemic in 2003, where survivors faced persistent physical and mental health issues for years.

Meta‐analysis studies of long‐term sequelae of COVID‐19 1‐ and 2‐year after SARS‐CoV‐2 infection described risk trajectories for neurological, physical, and psychological sequela and many other outcomes. There are some reports implicating that risks remain in the third year after infection and survivors with long COVID are at increased risk of varying adverse outcomes, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, neurological diseases, and kidney disease which might reduce individuals' quality of life and limit daily activity, and resulting in higher unemployment rates. It is not clear to what extent these symptom clusters persist beyond 3 years after infection. Importantly, there is no previous systematic review that described prolonged COVID‐19 symptoms beyond 3 years after SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Owing to insufficient evidence, we provide a systematic evaluation and detail, which will estimate the pooled prevalence of Long COVID symptoms up to 3 years after SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and also identify the potential risk predictors of these persistent symptoms up to 3 years after infection. Addressing this knowledge gap will facilitate policy development and inform long‐term management strategies in the prevention and response to COVID‐19, and also will inform the care of people with this condition.

Conclusion

In the absence of definitive management protocols, many treatment regimes have been explored in the treatment of COVID-19. Some of these treatments may have been tried out of desperation, and among these, some show initial promise. However, it is too early to see any published results of rigorous clinical trials.

Using the serum of recovered patients is a tried and tested approach, and trials are underway to study its effectiveness. This treatment appears to be helpful in the short term until definitive and effective treatments are found.

### Improvement of immune dysregulation in individuals with long COVID at 24-months following SARS-CoV-2 infection [^cece0cb7]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In summary, our data provides comprehensive evidence that the majority of measures of immunological dysfunction that we and others have previously reported up to 8-months in people with LC have resolved by 2-years in the majority (62%) of people with LC. Coupled with evidence of a general improvement in health-related quality of life measures from within the same individuals, this provides real optimism for people living with LC, and will be important for continuing to define the natural history of this new condition. Nevertheless, optimism must be tempered with caution and the understanding that in some individual’s full health has not been recovered (38%) even 2-years post COVID-19, and research into the pathogenesis and prognosis of LC must continue. Our previous observations of immune abnormalities at earlier timepoints have now be confirmed in international studies,,,. However, it may be that the triggers of LC symptomatology are not the same as the factors that maintain them. That is the lack of symptomatic recovery in some patients despite immunological recovery may relate to an alternate underlying pathology as a cause for their LC symptoms, such as an element of persisting sub-clinical end organ damage or psychosocial trauma, or the triggering of other immunological process that we are not able to fully evaluate by sampling in the periphery.

Ultimate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mitigation and crisis resolution is dependent on trustworthy data and actionable information. At present time, there is still no cure for COVID-19, although some treatments are being used in severe illness. Regrettably, as the SARS-CoV-2 virus spreads, the lack of cure has been accompanied by an increasing amount of medical misinformation. In particular, there is a lot of misinformation about how to treat patients who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms and for whom management at home is deemed appropriate. In this editorial, we highlight the risks deriving from this misinformation, which often arises from the publication of studies that are not conceptually and methodologically accurate.

### Characteristics and predictors of acute and chronic post-COVID syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^dbbec87f]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

To combat post-COVID syndrome effectively, a multi-faceted approach will be required. Current practice consists of following up individuals through self-reported symptoms and remote outpatient clinics. However, the investigations of choice for various symptoms, subsequent monitoring, and need for referral to specialist care has not yet been standardised. The COVID-19 pandemic has seen a marked adoption in health technology. Innovation in technologies have allowed for remote monitoring to take precedent with several trials and evaluations underway. One area of future research could see the utilisation of wearable sensors to monitor recovery from COVID-19.

We highlight the limited literature predicting post-COVID syndrome, indicating the need for enhanced surveillance programmes to be employed. Comparisons can be drawn from cancer survivorship in which the development of evidence-based frameworks (e.g. the National Cancer Survivorship Initiative) are deemed essential for the provision of personalised care. Individuals with post-COVID syndrome may experience long lasting effects requiring long lasting support. It has been reported that 15% of individuals were absent from work due to illness at the time of follow-up. It is imperative that this cohort is not forgotten about and broad education is provided to the public to enable better acceptability and understanding.

### Urgent needs to accelerate the race for COVID-19 therapeutics [^f71aa6a8]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

On December 8, 2020, a 91-year-old woman made history as the first person to receive the COVID-19 vaccine in the United Kingdom. Worldwide vaccination coverage will take time, especially in low-middle-income countries (LMICs) where access to coronavirus vaccines is limited and health systems are ill equipped to deal with sustained pressures associated with COVID-19. Meanwhile, hospital and critical care capacity will remain strained and basic therapies, including oxygen, are in urgent short supply.

COVID-19 has disproportionately impacted the world's poorest and most vulnerable, posing additional challenges in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.In addition to basic supportive therapies, there are still not enough effective therapeutic interventions widely available. There remains an urgent need to develop efficacious COVID-19 therapeutics to prevent severity and mortality, and to forestall the collapse of overburdened health systems in resource-limited settings.

It has been over a year since the world's biomedical community began to contend this novel coronavirus. Having effective treatments to target COVID-19 stages would lead to significant benefits. These include treatments to (i) prevent the development of infections (ii) prevent disease progression, and (iii) reduce mortality. To better understand COVID-19 therapeutics, much had to be learned about the virus, disease evolution, how to conduct trials under pandemic conditions, and how to link testing and treatment strategies.

Two major therapeutic strategies based on disease pathophysiology were developed: antiviral agents, which aim to stop virus spread in the respiratory tract, and host-directed therapeutics (anti-inflammatory and immunomodulators), which have mostly become later-stage interventions aimed at preventing downstream consequences of severe COVID-19.

Throughout 2021, the medical and scientific communities have focused on managing the acute morbidity and mortality caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. With the approval of multiple vaccines, there is a light at the end of this dark tunnel and an opportunity to focus on the future, including managing the long-term sequelae in patients who have survived acute COVID-19. In this Perspectives article, we highlight what is known about the cardiovascular sequelae in survivors of COVID-19 and discuss important questions that need to be addressed in prospective studies to understand and mitigate these lasting cardiovascular consequences, including in post-acute COVID-19 syndrome. To provide the greatest benefit to these survivors, prospective studies should begin now, with resources made available to monitor and study this population in the coming years.

Over the past year, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has swept the globe, resulting in an enormous worldwide burden of infection and mortality. However, the additional toll resulting from long-term consequences of the pandemic has yet to be tallied. Heterogeneous disease manifestations and syndromes are now recognized among some persons after their initial recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection, representing in the broadest sense a failure to return to a baseline state of health after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. On 3 to 4 December 2020, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, in collaboration with other Institutes and Centers of the National Institutes of Health, convened a virtual workshop to summarize existing knowledge on postacute COVID-19 and to identify key knowledge gaps regarding this condition.

### Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19: understanding and addressing the burden of multisystem manifestations [^6b4b4a1e]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection can develop symptoms that persist well beyond the acute phase of COVID-19 or emerge after the acute phase, lasting for weeks or months after the initial acute illness. The post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, which include physical, cognitive, and mental health impairments, are known collectively as long COVID or post-COVID-19 condition. The substantial burden of this multisystem condition is felt at individual, health-care system, and socioeconomic levels, on an unprecedented scale. Survivors of COVID-19-related critical illness are at risk of the well known sequelae of acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, and chronic critical illness, and these multidimensional morbidities might be difficult to differentiate from the specific effects of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. We provide an overview of the manifestations of post-COVID-19 condition after critical illness in adults. We explore the effects on various organ systems, describe potential pathophysiological mechanisms, and consider the challenges of providing clinical care and support for survivors of critical illness with multisystem manifestations. Research is needed to reduce the incidence of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19-related critical illness and to optimise therapeutic and rehabilitative care and support for patients.

The statement specifies that “Two key aspects of addressing mental health symptoms in the setting of Long COVID are to (1) validate that the patient's symptoms are real, and (2) be aware that some mental health-related medications can affect other Long COVID symptoms,” notes that “Mental health assessment and management are largely symptom based and mirror approaches used outside the Long COVID setting,” and emphasizes that “Notably, clinicians should have a suicide plan in place as part of emergency clinic protocols.”

Although the exact prevalence of post-COVID-19 condition (also known as long COVID) is unknown, more than a third of patients with COVID-19 develop symptoms that persist for more than 3 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. These sequelae are highly heterogeneous in nature and adversely affect multiple biological systems, although breathlessness is a frequently cited symptom. Specific pulmonary sequelae, including pulmonary fibrosis and thromboembolic disease, need careful assessment and might require particular investigations and treatments. COVID-19 outcomes in people with pre-existing respiratory conditions vary according to the nature and severity of the respiratory disease and how well it is controlled. Extrapulmonary complications such as reduced exercise tolerance and frailty might contribute to breathlessness in post-COVID-19 condition. Non-pharmacological therapeutic options, including adapted pulmonary rehabilitation programmes and physiotherapy techniques for breathing management, might help to attenuate breathlessness in people with post-COVID-19 condition. Further research is needed to understand the origins and course of respiratory symptoms and to develop effective therapeutic and rehabilitative strategies.

### Lived experience of work and long COVID in healthcare staff [^07ad030a]. Occupational Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Healthcare workers (HCWs), many with frontline roles caring for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), had a greater occupational risk of exposure and developing severe COVID-19 than the general population. HCWs also report higher rates of long COVID (LC) compared to other employment sectors, with an estimated 4% of people employed in healthcare reporting symptoms.

The term ‘long COVID’ refers to prolonged signs, symptoms and conditions continuing or developing following initial COVID-19 infection that are not explained by alternative diagnosis. Although imprecise, this definition is embodied in current joint National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines on the management of long-term effects of COVID-19, where LC is defined as ‘ongoing symptomatic COVID-19’ (symptoms lasting 4–12 weeks) and ‘post-COVID-19 syndrome’ (symptoms beyond 12 weeks). This aligns with the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s definition where LC is broadly defined as signs, symptoms and conditions that continue or develop after initial COVID-19 infection resulting in a ‘wide range of ongoing health problems’, and similar to the World Health Organization’s (WHO) ‘post-COVID-19 condition’.

Treatment

Uncertainty About How to Treat Long COVID

When describing treatments received to address long COVID symptoms, many patients noted that they believed their providers were still learning about long COVID and were therefore uncertain how to treat this condition. Several patients also recognized their own role in learning how to treat and manage their long COVID symptoms along with their providers. As one patient explained, “It’s kind of like both of us trying to figure it out at the same time, hand in hand.” Patients also described taking ownership in learning about options for treating their long COVID symptoms, by gathering information and sharing it with their providers. One patient shared, “I researched it. And I brought forward ideas and thoughts. And these are things that these clinics are doing and looking at and what makes sense and what doesn’t.”

Appreciation of Providers Who Are Open to Treatment Options

Without evidence-based treatments for long COVID, many patients expressed an appreciation for providers who were open to trying new therapies. One patient explained, “Reminding me that, ‘Okay, we don’t have research to back what I’m recommending, but what do you think about trying this?’ So certainly, appreciate the transparency and the willingness to try different things that maybe we don’t really know if they’re not–they’re not proven necessarily, but a willingness to try things to help you feel better.” Several patients noted that this openness to treatment options was important to them especially when their diagnostic tests were normal, or when their providers did not understand the cause of their symptoms. See Table 4 in the Appendix for additional supporting quotations.

Introduction

Infection with SARS-CoV-2 resulting in COVID-19 exhibits a wide range of symptoms including respiratory and pulmonary symptoms during the acute phase of disease.The key characteristics include remarkably variable individual health responses from those who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms to those with life-threatening severe disease or even death.An increasing number of patients suffer from disabling long-term consequences, post-COVID syndrome (PCS, also known as Long COVID, post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 or post-acute COVID-19 syndrome). Furthermore, the symptomatology of PCS varies between patients creating a challenge both for disease diagnosis, management and public health overview of the extent of the problem.

The global consensus on how PCS should be diagnosed and treated is still developing based on the efforts from the WHO, patient organisations and the Centre of Disease Control in providing guidelines and International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for diagnosis. PCS is thought to affect multiple organs,and potentially initial severity of COVID-19 could be a risk factor for PCS.Our understanding of the magnitude of how much vaccines protect against PCS is evolving.Breakthrough infections following vaccination and reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 also associate with long-term organ sequelae.

The symptoms attributed to PCS are still being characterised, and there could be several different clinical phenotypes; however, dyspnoea and fatigue seem to be central symptomatic components of PCS.Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) refers to a set of physical, cognitive and psychological impairments that survivors of intensive care often experience, with issues like muscle weakness, memory loss and depression.This could be similar to issues found in PCS.

To understand how clinicians attribute symptoms and PCS diagnosis, we examined risk factors and associated clinical features in patients who received a PCS ICD code in a total population of COVID-19 cohort in Sweden. To avoid classifying symptomatology due to PICS, COVID-19 patients with PCS were compared with disease severity-matched COVID-19 patients with no PCS diagnosis.

Background

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a tremendous impact on global health. The disease spectrum of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is wide, ranging from asymptomatic to critical illness. Because COVID-19 is a new disease, the impact on long-term outcomes in survivors is still emerging. Similar to other post viral syndromes, there are reports of prolonged effects after acute COVID-19. Survivors have contributed to the recognition of a syndrome called “Long COVID,” characterized by persistent symptoms or long-term complications, but there is no agreed clinical definition of Long COVID, nor a clear treatment pathway.

The critically ill population is likely to be especially vulnerable to the prolonged effects of COVID-19, but it is possible that the effects of COVID-19 are similar to other illnesses. Survivors of critical illnesses have previously reported long-term impairments in physical, cognitive and/or psychological function, often known as post-intensive care syndrome. Study of the sequelae in survivors of COVID-19 critical illness is urgently needed. This will allow clinicians to develop an evidence-based multidisciplinary approach for management of these patients, and to inform research priorities. While there have been several reports about ongoing symptoms, the impact of these on new disability remains unclear. The aim of this study was to describe the incidence of a poor outcome defined as death or new disability, changes from baseline in functional outcomes and health-related quality of life, work status, and persistent symptoms of COVID-19 at 6 months from COVID-19 critical illness.

### Post COVID sequelae among COVID-19 survivors: insights from the Indian national clinical registry for COVID-19 [^2315143b]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Globally, the COVID-19 pandemic presented unprecedented challenges in the areas of prevention and care, and even today it continues to devastate the economy as well as human lives. COVID-19 complications do not end with recovery from acute infection, but continue to involve multiple systems for periods much longer than the acute phase.Studies have suggested the burden of long COVID to be up to 45% with a range of symptoms including fatigue, dyspnoea, mental health problems, gastrointestinal symptoms, persistent loss of smell and taste, etc.The exact definition and nomenclature for these sequelae are still evolving and are being termed as post COVID condition, long COVID, post COVID syndrome, etc. The WHO defines post COVID-19 condition as ‘an illness that occurs in people who have a history of probable or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection; usually three months from the onset of COVID-19, with symptoms and effects that last for at least two months. The symptoms and effects of post COVID-19 condition cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis.’The Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India (MOH&FW, GOI) defines post COVID syndrome as a condition characterised by signs and symptoms that develop during or after an infection consistent with COVID-19 which continue for more than 12 weeks and are not explained by alternative diagnosis.The reasons for long-term sequelae of COVID-19 are incompletely understood and could be multifactorial, including the pre-existing comorbidities, disease severity and therapy received during active disease, grief due to personal losses, mental and psychological effects of the disease, etc. As the population size of COVID-19 survivors is increasing due to the lingering pandemic, post-infection immunity and wide coverage of vaccination,understanding the pattern of post COVID sequelae becomes important with its implication for care and support. In this context, we conducted the present investigation to describe the pattern and estimate the frequency of post COVID sequelae, early post-discharge mortality and the risk factors associated with it. The overall purpose was to help develop a framework for holistic interdisciplinary management of post COVID-19 sequelae specific to Indian settings.

Long COVID risk-factor modification—support a healthy lifestyle and preventive care: “Support a healthy lifestyle with education, counseling, and referrals to community and social support resources”; emphasize “Whole-food plant-predominant nutrition,” “Stress management (e.g., consider mindfulness, meditation),” and “Sleep optimization,” and “Address obstructive sleep apnea or other sleep disorders, if present.” For sleep, consider “CBT-I, if available” (cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia). Encourage “Regular physical activity as tolerated, without triggering PEM/PESE” (post-exertional malaise/post-exertional symptom exacerbation). Evaluate for nutritional deficiencies and “Use caution if considering a restrictive diet”; if interested, pursue under nutritionist/dietician guidance. Immunizations: “Stay up to date on vaccines,” and note that “COVID-19 vaccination is not contraindicated except in cases of preexisting allergy or previous serious adverse reaction.” Also “Treat coexisting conditions.”

### Long COVID after breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection [^73ce48ec]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The post-acute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection-also referred to as Long COVID-have been described, but whether breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection (BTI) in vaccinated people results in post-acute sequelae is not clear. In this study, we used the US Department of Veterans Affairs national healthcare databases to build a cohort of 33,940 individuals with BTI and several controls of people without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including contemporary (n=4,983,491), historical (n=5,785,273) and vaccinated (n=2,566,369) controls. At 6months after infection, we show that, beyond the first 30days of illness, compared to contemporary controls, people with BTI exhibited a higher risk of death (hazard ratio (HR)=1.75, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.59, 1.93) and incident post-acute sequelae (HR=1.50, 95% CI: 1.46, 1.54), including cardiovascular, coagulation and hematologic, gastrointestinal, kidney, mental health, metabolic, musculoskeletal and neurologic disorders. The results were consistent in comparisons versus the historical and vaccinated controls. Compared to people with SARS-CoV-2 infection who were not previously vaccinated (n=113,474), people with BTI exhibited lower risks of death (HR=0.66, 95% CI: 0.58, 0.74) and incident post-acute sequelae (HR=0.85, 95% CI: 0.82, 0.89). Altogether, the findings suggest that vaccination before infection confers only partial protection in the post-acute phase of the disease; hence, reliance on it as a sole mitigation strategy may not optimally reduce long-term health consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The findings emphasize the need for continued optimization of strategies for primary prevention of BTI and will guide development of post-acute care pathways for people with BTI.

### Long COVID trajectories in the prospectively followed RECOVER-adult US cohort [^58603650]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

In this large, prospective, longitudinal analysis of participants enrolled in the RECOVER Adult cohort, we identified multiple post-infection trajectories capturing distinct patterns of symptom burden. We found 5% of infected participants persistently met the threshold for Long COVID for 15 months, and an additional 12% of participants had an intermittently high burden of Long COVID-related symptoms that did not improve over time. Among the 10% of participants who met research index criteria for Long COVID at 3 months, 46% were in the persistent Long COVID group, 35% continued to have intermittent Long COVID-related symptoms, and 19% were in the group that was improving over time. The latter group had an encouraging trajectory of improvement in symptom burden over 15 months, with the majority of the improvement occurring over the course of the first few months.

In contrast, we observed some participants (14%) whose LCRI increased over time (profiles E and F). There was a comparable proportion of reinfections in these individuals relative to other trajectory profiles, suggesting that this increase in their LCRI may not be explained by newly developed Long COVID after reinfection. Additional possibilities for this rise in LCRI include increasing clinical symptoms from a delayed pathophysiologic processor an intercurrent illness not related to Long COVID, though biological measures were not directly assessed in this study. When compared to a continually uninfected cohort, we observed a lower frequency of participants with symptom profiles A–D, which includes all profiles with persistent or improving symptoms, but a similar frequency of profile E (worsening, moderate), and so it is possible that profile E may ultimately be unrelated to Long COVID.

General principles of COVID-19 pharmacotherapy—During the early phase of infection, when viral load is high and the host’s adaptive immune response has not mounted, treatments targeting viral replication are most likely to be effective; these include nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, molnupiravir, remdesivir, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and donor convalescent plasma, and timely initiation is critical because they are more efficacious when given within 5 to 7 days of symptom onset. Most patients do not progress to severe or critical disease, but some with risk factors do; later in the disease process, in severe and especially critical disease, an excessive and aberrant inflammatory response is implicated as the primary cause of immunopathological damage, and anti-inflammatory therapies like corticosteroids, IL-6 inhibitors or JAK inhibitors have been shown to be beneficial.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) COVID-19 guideline—evidence to recommendations: The panel considered core elements of the GRADE evidence, including certainty of evidence and the balance between desirable and undesirable effects, and acknowledged additional domains where applicable (feasibility, resource use, acceptability). For all recommendations, expert panelists reached consensus, with voting rules agreed on prior to the panel meetings for situations when consensus could not be reached; if deciding between a strong or a conditional recommendation in the same direction, “80% of the panel must vote for a strong recommendation,” and when deciding between a conditional recommendation or no recommendation, “50% of the panel must vote for the same option with less than 20% voting for the alternative option.” Recommendations are labeled as “strong” or “conditional”; “we recommend” indicates strong recommendations and “we suggest” indicates conditional recommendations. Where comparators are not formally stated, the comparison of interest is implicitly “not using the intervention,” and the recommendations acknowledge the current “knowledge gap” and aim at avoiding premature favorable recommendations and the rapid diffusion of potentially ineffective or harmful interventions.

### Intravenous immunoglobulin as a potential treatment for long COVID [^adb674e4]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

On 31 July 2023, the United States Department of Health and Human Services announced the formation of the Office of Long COVID Research and Practice and the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) opened enrollment for the therapeutic arm of the RECOVER initiative, a prospective, randomized study to evaluate new treatment options for long coronavirus disease 2019 (long COVID).

Areas Covered

One of the first drugs to be studied in this nationwide initiative is intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), which will be a treatment option for subjects enrolled in RECOVER-AUTO, a randomized trial to investigate therapeutic strategies for autonomic dysfunction related to long COVID.

Expert Opinion

IVIG is a mixture of human antibodies (human immunoglobulin) that has been widely used to treat a variety of diseases, including immune thrombocytopenia purpura, Kawasaki disease, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and certain infections such as influenza, human immunodeficiency virus, and measles. However, the role of IVIG in the treatment of post-COVID-19 conditions is uncertain. This manuscript examines what is known about IVIG in the treatment of long COVID and explores how this therapeutic agent may be used in the future to address this condition.

### Ending this pandemic and securing the future [^57ef52ea]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

At the heart of any effort to strengthen global capacity to prevent and respond to pandemics must be a stronger, financially secure, and more authoritative World Health Organization. We hope the the World Health Assembly will make haste on a pandemic treaty: to fail to do so would be to miss yet another opportunity for vital reforms to ensure that WHO can detect and alert the world to future threats more quickly. The Member State Working Group on strengthening WHO preparedness and response to health emergencies has discussed several of the independent panel’s recommendations, and these must now be taken up by WHO governing bodies.

Pandemics are not ended by a magic bullet, but by a combination of essential measures: leader level commitment, finance, equitable access to global public goods, new legal instruments, and a stronger and more authoritative WHO. The world cannot afford to wait another six months to begin delivering on vital reforms which could make covid-19 the world’s last pandemic.

### Studying the post-COVID-19 condition: research challenges, strategies, and importance of core outcome set development [^ef9df2c3]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Post-COVID condition health consequences

Recent editorials and National Institutes of Health (NIH) and WHO sponsored conferences have drawn attention to an increasing number of people experiencing health consequences following the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection and are calling for research into the risk factors, clinical features, diagnosis, management, and outcomes. Increasing funding opportunities have subsequently followed. It is important to note that most data regarding post-COVID-19 condition have been generated prior to the condition definition announcement. Thus, earlier studies may not fit the proposed definition criteria. Post-COVID-19 condition extends beyond the cardio-respiratory system to affect most other bodily systems both anatomically and physiologically. Although causes of post-COVID-19 condition are unclear, persistent immune activation may be involved. Risk factors for different syndromes of post-acute SARS-CoV-2 sequela have not been characterised, but it has been hypothesised that several post-COVID-19 condition phenotypes may exist, although pathophysiology, management, and outcomes are currently unknown.

Long-term health consequences of COVID-19 remain unknown, but reports suggest that prolonged symptom duration and limitations in functioning are common among hospitalised as well as non-hospitalised adults and children. The spectrum of long-lasting symptoms is wide and varies from mild discomfort to severe adverse effects on physical, cognitive, and psychosocial health, with important wider implications on functioning, including employment and school attendance.

Multiple studies from different countries found that many individuals experienced persistent symptoms 6 months after COVID-19, with fatigue or muscle weakness, sleep difficulties, and anxiety or depression among the most common sequelae. A recent study suggests that although most COVID-19 survivors recover both physically and functionally a year after acute infection, some still experience problems with mobility, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression compared with non-COVID-19 controls. The data emerging from the controlled studies are in agreement with the earlier reports. A recent analysis of the data from over 250,000 electronic health records demonstrated that more than one in three individuals had one or more features of post-COVID-19 condition recorded between 3 and 6 months after a diagnosis of COVID-19, which was significantly higher when compared with individuals with influenza. Disease severity, female sex, and younger age were associated with a higher risk of post-COVID-19 condition development.

Key Points

Question

What are the short-term and long-term postacute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) infection?

Findings

In this systematic review of 57 studies comprising more than 250 000 survivors of COVID-19, most sequelae included mental health, pulmonary, and neurologic disorders, which were prevalent longer than 6 months after SARS-CoV-2 exposure.

Meaning

These findings suggest that long-term PASC must be factored into existing health care systems, especially in low- and middle-income countries.

Long COVID—work participation and disability considerations state that the return-to-work process for individuals with Long COVID can be challenging because symptoms can fluctuate, vary in nature, affect multiple functional areas and often manifest as an “invisible disability” that may not be readily acknowledged by employers or coworkers, and that clinicians can help patients return to work by identifying suitable workplace accommodations and resources, providing necessary documentation, and recommending occupational or vocational therapy when needed; if these efforts are unsuccessful and work significantly worsens Long COVID symptoms or impedes recovery, applying for disability may be warranted, and Long COVID is recognized as a potential disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act.

### Complexity and challenges of the clinical diagnosis and management of long COVID [^95932d83]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Monitoring, Diagnostic Testing, and Referral

When faced with uncertainty about the etiology, future course, and optimal management of patients’ underlying symptoms and the possibility that these might be due to long COVID, clinicians sometimes adopted a watchful waiting strategy (quotation 17) (Table 2). However, clinicians more commonly recommended additional testing or specialist referral. We found examples of clinicians obtaining imaging and other tests to monitor for recovery from COVID-19 (quotation 18) (Table 2). Clinicians also routinely recommended additional testing or specialist referral to support or refute the diagnosis of long COVID (quotation 19) and search for alternative potential etiologies of patients’ symptoms (quotations 20 and 21) (Table 2). Diagnostic testing to evaluate post–COVID-19 symptoms could lead to further monitoring, diagnostic testing, and referral (quotation 22), as could enrollment in post–COVID-19 programs (quotations 23 and 24) (Table 2).

Care Fragmentation

Post–COVID-19 care processes, including the nascent post–COVID-19 clinics and COVID-19 convalescence telehealth programs that were emerging within and outside the VA during the observation period, were often siloed from and poorly coordinated with other aspects of care and could be burdensome to patients. Subthemes within the broader theme of care fragmentation, with representative quotes, are presented in Table 3.

Siloed Approach

Based on documentation in patients’ EHRs, post–COVID-19 care processes seemed to be largely added on to the care that patients were already receiving, with their other clinicians involved only peripherally (quotation 25) (Table 3). Intake for post–COVID-19 programs typically included a detailed account of each patient’s COVID-19 history along with systematic screening for COVID-19–related symptoms and visits with members of a multidisciplinary team (eg, psychology, physical therapy, nutrition. speech and language) (quotation 26) (Table 3). Outside of this context, the notes of patients’ other clinicians often focused on narrow aspects of their post–COVID-19 clinical presentation relevant to the treating discipline or specialty (quotations 27 and 28) (Table 3). Primary care clinic notes tended to list prior SARS-CoV-2 infection as a discrete item in the clinical assessment and plan, disconnected from patients’ other problems and presenting concerns (quotation 29).

### Neurologic manifestations of long COVID differ based on acute COVID-19 severity [^bbbd8aa4]. Annals of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Long COVID/PASC continues to occur despite vaccination and boosters, and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) estimated that up to 23 million Americans were affected in March 2022, pushing 1 million people out of work.Neurologic manifestations of PASC are very debilitating, and the president of the American Academy of Neurology stated in July 2022 that long COVID was the third leading neurologic condition in the United States.Accordingly, the need for dedicated training in Neuro-PASC care is evidenced by the high demand of televisits from patients coming from many US states where they do not have access to Neuro-infectious diseases specialists. As the number of hospitalized individuals with COVID-19 continues to decrease, Neuro-PASC will affect predominantly the younger group of non-hospitalized patients. The loss of productivity associated with lingering cognitive dysfunction experienced by people in their prime will undoubtebly have a substantial economic impact.

Differences between PNP and NNP patients characterized in our study suggest that distinct pathogenic mechanisms may be at play in those 2 groups, emphasizing the need to evaluate these populations separately. Of concern, a large treatment trial of PASC with Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir (Paxlovid) which is being organized by the NIH RECOVER initiative, does not include outcome measures based on severity of acute COVID-19.Although much progress has been made in the symptomatic management of Neuro-PASC,further research is urgently needed to elucidate the root cause of Long COVID, delineate risk factors and biomarkers of disease activity, and devise targeted therapeutic interventions for this debilitating syndrome.-

### Association between malnutrition and post-acute COVID-19 sequelae: a retrospective cohort study [^5858dcc4]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in >100 million cases and >1 million deaths to date in the United States.However, a second pandemic has dramatically emerged with the recognition of post–acute COVID-19, a syndrome characterized by persistent symptoms and/or delayed or long-term complications. Post-COVID conditions consist of a wide range of new, returning, or ongoing health problems people can experience ≥4 weeks after first being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and may ultimately result in death. Collectively, these symptoms have been labeled “long COVID,” but diagnosis is often hindered because no established criteria for post–acute COVID exist.Because millions of people have been infected, and more will continue to be infected, the number of new conditions, chronic diseases, and fatalities caused by long-term manifestations of COVID-19 is dramatically increasing. This can potentially add a major burden to an already stressed healthcare system and negatively impact health and quality of life for those afflicted. Because these symptoms can be long lasting and difficult to eradicate, the management of COVID-19 shifts from the acute care model to a chronic disease management model,which focuses on prevention and treatment. However, little is known about which individuals develop long COVID and why.

Malnutrition has been associated with adverse outcomes in patients with acute COVID-19. For example, in adults hospitalized with COVID-19, the presence of malnutrition increased the odds of mortality by nearly three times compared with those who are well-nourished.Despite this, there is a dearth of evidence describing the impact of malnutrition in long COVID. As the population of patients recovering from COVID-19 grows, it is paramount to establish an understanding of the healthcare issues and risk factors for adverse outcomes surrounding them. To address this knowledge gap, we aimed to evaluate the impact of malnutrition on postacute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), including death, long COVID diagnosis, SARS-CoV-2 reinfection, and the development of other phenotypic abnormalities. As a secondary aim, we sought to investigate the effect of hospital-acquired (HAC) malnutrition on PASC.

How to approach a patient when considering pharmacologic treatments for COVID-19—this section discusses how to approach a patient suspected to have COVID-19 and how to apply the IDSA COVID-19 treatment guidelines to specific clinical syndromes. The guideline notes that the certainty of supporting evidence is low to moderate for most recommendations and that the panel made conditional suggestions rather than strong recommendations for or against most of the agents. It further states that though substantial progress was made with COVID-19 therapies, there remain many unanswered questions in the management of COVID-19, and that despite limited evidence, to give actionable and timely guidance to frontline clinicians, it provides recommendations for use of combinations of agents, recommends some agents over others, or extrapolates to sub populations not evaluated in trials. Critical unanswered questions identified include which sub-populations or specific clinical types of patients benefit most from specific therapeutic agents, what the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 therapies are in populations immune from prior SARS-CoV-2 infections and vaccination, what the efficacy and safety of treatments are in infections with specific SARS-CoV-2 variants and sub-variants, and how therapeutic agents perform when compared to each other to allow a tiered approach to treating patients with COVID-19.

### Short-term and long-term rates of postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection: a systematic review [^3c9b6cfa]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

To our knowledge, short-term and long-term sequelae of COVID-19 have not been systematically evaluated. In this paper, we synthesized the existing literature to estimate the overall and organ system–specific frequency of postacute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). We sorted studies into groups that focused on (1) postacute symptoms at 1-month after acute COVID-19 (short term), (2) persisting and new clinical manifestations between 2 and 5 months after infection (intermediate term), and (3) clinical manifestations that were present at least 6 months after COVID-19 (long term). These categorizations were based on literature reports proposing a framework that COVID-19 infection progresses from an acute infection lasting approximately 2 weeks into a postacute hyperinflammatory illness lasting approximately 4 weeks, until ultimately entering late sequelae. As we better understand the disease burden of PASC in COVID-19 survivors, we can develop precise treatment plans to improve clinical care in patients with COVID-19 who are at greatest risk of PASC and establish integrated, evidence-based clinical management for those affected.

Long COVID mental health management—nonpharmacologic management largely mirrors mental health treatment in the absence of Long COVID, including validating experience, psychotherapy options (supportive, cognitive behavioral, group, or exposure therapy), using caution with exposure therapy if dysautonomia is present, and addressing coexisting pain, sleep disorders, and neurologic symptoms, noting that mental health symptoms can be worsened by (and can worsen) other Long COVID symptoms; free apps are available by the VA. Pharmacologic management notes considering psychotropic medication management per standard approaches outside the Long COVID setting and considering weaning/de-prescribing anti-hypertensive and sedating medications; see Table 5 for commonly used medications for Long COVID. Referral guidance includes to the emergency department for thoughts of harm to self or others with a plan, means, and intent, and to a mental health specialist for psychosis, significant PTSD, passive suicidal ideation, or active substance addiction, including referral to a social worker, therapist, counselor, neuropsychologist, clinical psychologist, and/or psychiatrist.

### Development and validation of the symptom burden questionnaire for long COVID (SBQ-LC): rasch analysis [^e74b2a9f]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in 2019, the covid-19 pandemic has resulted in more than 450 million infections and more than six million deaths worldwide.Although infection is mild and short lived for many people, a proportion continue to experience or go on to develop symptoms that persist beyond the acute phase of infection. These persistent symptoms are known collectively as post-acute sequelae of covid-19, post-acute covid-19, post-covid-19 syndrome, post-covid-19 condition, or long covid.

Symptom burden can be defined as the “subjective, quantifiable prevalence, frequency, and severity of symptoms placing a physiologic burden on patients and producing multiple negative, physical, and emotional patient responses.”The symptoms reported by those with long covid are heterogenous and can affect multiple organ systems, with fatigue, dyspnoea, and impaired concentration among the most prevalent symptoms.Symptoms may be persistent, cyclical, or episodic and can pose a substantial burden for affected individuals, with negative consequences for work capability, functioning, and quality of life.There is a growing body of research on the prevalence, incidence, co-occurrence, and persistence of the signs and symptoms of long covid.These data have largely been collected using bespoke, cross sectional survey tools due, in part, to the limited availability of condition specific, validated self-report instruments.

Patient reported outcomes are measures of health reported directly by patients without amendment or interpretation by clinicians or anyone else.Validated instruments measuring patient reported outcomes developed specifically for long covid that address the complex, multifactorial nature of the condition are needed urgently to further the understanding of long covid symptoms and underlying pathophysiology, support best practice in the clinical management of patients, and evaluate the safety, effectiveness, acceptability, and tolerability of interventions.Validated instruments to measure patient reported outcomes have recently been developed to measure the global impact of long covid, and several unvalidated screening tools, surveys, and questionnaires are also available.However, individuals living with long covid have suggested that existing self-report measures fail to capture the breadth of experienced symptoms.To address the need for a comprehensive measure of self-reported symptom burden specific to long covid, we used Rasch analysis to develop and validate, in accordance with US Food and Drug Administration guidance, a novel instrument measuring patient reported outcomes, the symptom burden questionnaire for long covid (SBQ-LC).

### COVID-19 and cancer: a comprehensive review [^f923ab51]. Current Oncology Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged to be the biggest global health threat worldwide, which has now infected over 1.7 million people and claimed more than 100,000 lives around the world. Under these unprecedented circumstances, there are no well-established guidelines for cancer patients.

Recent Findings

The risk for serious disease and death in COVID-19 cases increases with advancing age and presence of comorbid health conditions. Since the emergence of the first case in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, tremendous research efforts have been underway to understand the mechanisms of infectivity and transmissibility of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), a fatal virus responsible for abysmal survival outcomes. To minimize the mortality rate, it becomes prudent to identify symptoms promptly and employ treatments appropriately. Even though no cure has been established, multiple clinical trials are underway to determine the most optimal strategy. Managing cancer patients under these circumstances is rather challenging, given their vulnerable status and the aggressive nature of their underlying disease. In this comprehensive review, we discuss the impact of COVID-19 on health and the immune system of those affected, reviewing the latest treatment approaches and ongoing clinical trials. Additionally, we discuss challenges faced while treating cancer patients and propose potential approaches to manage this vulnerable population during this pandemic.
