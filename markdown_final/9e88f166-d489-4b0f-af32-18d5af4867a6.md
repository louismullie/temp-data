## Question

imaging for umbilical hernia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about imaging in umbilical hernia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial clinical assessment and when imaging is unnecessary. Then, I should verify the indications that truly warrant imaging. Next, I will evaluate modality selection by scenario: routine adult, pediatric, acute complications, preoperative planning, and special populations. After that, I need to check the diagnostic performance and limitations of each modality. Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and close with key takeaways and caveats, ensuring each step aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the foundation: most umbilical hernias are diagnosed clinically by history and examination, and routine imaging is not indicated when the diagnosis is straightforward and there are no red flags; I should double-check that this principle is supported by both radiology and surgical guidance, which it is, including ACR Appropriateness Criteria and the AIUM abdominal wall ultrasound parameter emphasizing exam-first strategies and selective imaging only when needed [^117AxgYu] [^1135xHQE].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to enumerate the scenarios where imaging meaningfully changes management, because that is the crux of appropriateness: diagnostic uncertainty or occult hernia, acute complications such as incarceration or suspected strangulation, preoperative planning for complex or recurrent hernias, pediatric differentiation of umbilical versus epigastric defects, and special populations including pregnancy, cirrhosis with ascites, and patients with prior laparoscopic trocar sites; these indications are echoed in emergency general surgery algorithms, hernia society guidance, and pediatric literature, so I should keep these buckets in mind as I proceed [^1135xHQE] [^117AxgYu] [^112Gz4pz].

> Now, for adult patients with suspected umbilical hernia, I initially thought ultrasound might be the best first-line test because it avoids radiation; wait, let me verify that against the evidence base and guidelines, because I should correct that assumption if it is too broad, and indeed, while ultrasound is reasonable in thin patients or for targeted questions, CT is generally the most accurate modality for adult abdominal wall hernias and is preferred when the exam is equivocal, when complications are suspected, or when detailed anatomy is needed for planning; MRI is a radiation-free alternative when CT is contraindicated or when soft-tissue characterization is paramount [^115BLbep] [^113iejFW].

> For pediatric patients, I need to ensure I am aligning with age-appropriate imaging; ultrasound is the first-line modality because it characterizes fascial defects, differentiates umbilical from epigastric hernias, and guides management without radiation, and this is consistently supported by pediatric surgical series and ultrasound practice parameters; MRI is reserved for complex cases or when ultrasound is nondiagnostic, and routine CT should be avoided in children due to radiation [^112Gz4pz] [^115fi1qS] [^114GxFrE].

> In the acute setting with suspected incarceration or strangulation, I should confirm that CT is the modality of choice because it rapidly delineates hernia contents, bowel viability, obstruction, and extraluminal complications; point-of-care ultrasound can assist at the bedside to assess reducibility and perfusion, but CT best informs operative decision-making and should not be delayed when the patient is unstable or the diagnosis is uncertain; emergency algorithms also emphasize early surgical consultation and not letting imaging delay necessary intervention [^1135xHQE] [^114X9i2R] [^112GDMPZ].

> For preoperative planning, I need to check whether cross-sectional imaging meaningfully alters surgical strategy; CT or MRI can identify occult defects, define relationships to adjacent structures, and inform mesh selection and fixation plans, and this is particularly relevant for complex, recurrent, or non-midline hernias where physical examination underestimates disease burden; hernia society guidance supports selective preoperative CT or MRI in such scenarios [^117AxgYu] [^116k8wyD].

> Let me consider special populations carefully; in pregnancy, ultrasound is first-line and MRI without gadolinium is reasonable if additional detail is needed, whereas CT is generally avoided; in cirrhosis with ascites, ultrasound-guided umbilical paracentesis of the hernia sac can facilitate reduction and temporize until definitive repair; in patients with prior laparoscopic trocar sites, imaging is often warranted because trocar-site hernias are underrecognized clinically and occur more frequently than exam alone suggests, especially at the umbilicus and with larger port sizes [^116rKmxe] [^112Uqi17] [^114MW8PD] [^117BbL8R].

> Next, I should review diagnostic performance so I do not overstate any modality; CT demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity for ventral hernias and complications and is the reference standard in most adult algorithms; ultrasound has excellent sensitivity and specificity in experienced hands but is operator-dependent and less reliable for occult hernias or deep defects; MRI offers high soft-tissue contrast and is particularly useful when radiation avoidance is critical or when differentiating hernia from musculoskeletal or soft-tissue mimics; importantly, multiple studies and guidelines converge on CT as the most accurate test when imaging is indicated, with ultrasound as a close second in many settings [^115BLbep] [^113iejFW].

> I will now examine key imaging features that change management; I should confirm that we actively look for bowel within the sac, wall thickening, mesenteric fat stranding, free fluid, obstruction, and vascular compromise, and I should remember that morphometrics such as the hernia-to-neck ratio greater than 2.5 predict higher complication risk and may push toward earlier repair even if symptoms are modest; these features are well described in CT reviews and surgical series and should be explicitly reported [^112GDMPZ] [^115NPva9].

> But wait, what if the clinical picture is a mimic; I need to ensure the differential remains in view because imaging can clarify atypical masses such as urachal anomalies, endometriosis, or postoperative abscesses masquerading as hernias; in such cases, MRI may help characterize endometriosis or deep soft-tissue involvement, and targeted ultrasound can distinguish cystic from hernia content when the exam is equivocal [^112aRLXF] [^117SfV2N] [^115fi1qS].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm without oversimplifying; if the diagnosis is clear on exam and there are no concerning features, no imaging is needed and the patient can proceed to elective management; if the diagnosis is uncertain or an occult hernia is suspected, obtain ultrasound first in children and CT first in adults, escalating to MRI if CT is contraindicated or if further soft-tissue detail is needed; if acute pain, nonreducibility, skin changes, or systemic toxicity are present, prioritize surgical consultation and obtain urgent CT; if preoperative planning is required for complex or recurrent hernias, obtain CT or MRI to define anatomy and occult defects; tailor modality choice in pregnancy, cirrhosis, and post-laparoscopy patients as above [^1135xHQE] [^116mgPb9] [^117AxgYu].

> Finally, I should double-check the key takeaways to ensure internal consistency; imaging is problem-driven and should not be routine when the diagnosis is obvious; CT is the most accurate modality for adult hernia assessment and complication detection; ultrasound is preferred in children and for targeted questions; MRI is a valuable problem-solver when radiation avoidance or soft-tissue characterization is important; and across scenarios, early surgical involvement for complicated hernias prevents dangerous delays while selective imaging refines diagnosis and planning [^115BLbep] [^112Gz4pz] [^1135xHQE].

Imaging for umbilical hernia is **not routinely required** [^116TfY7C] when the diagnosis is clear on clinical examination; however, **ultrasound is first-line** [^115fi1qS] when imaging is needed (e.g. diagnostic uncertainty, pediatric patients, or to assess reducibility/complications) [^112Gz4pz] [^114GxFrE]. CT is the **modality of choice** [^115BLbep] for acute presentations with suspected incarceration, strangulation, or bowel obstruction, and for complex or recurrent hernias requiring detailed anatomical assessment [^1135xHQE]. MRI is reserved for **complex cases** [^116mgPb9], when radiation must be avoided, or when soft-tissue characterization is needed. Plain radiography is generally not helpful and should be avoided [^116mgPb9].

---

## Indications for imaging

Imaging is **not routinely indicated** for umbilical hernias diagnosed clinically; however, certain scenarios necessitate imaging:

- **Diagnostic uncertainty**: When clinical examination is inconclusive or cannot differentiate from other abdominal wall masses [^115fi1qS].

- **Pediatric patients**: Ultrasound is preferred to confirm diagnosis, assess reducibility, and guide management [^115BLbep] [^115fi1qS].

- **Acute presentations**: Suspected incarceration, strangulation, or bowel obstruction require urgent imaging [^116mgPb9].

- **Complex or recurrent hernias**: Preoperative planning may require detailed anatomical assessment [^116k8wyD].

## Specific clinical scenarios and recommended imaging

### Pediatric patients

Ultrasound is the **preferred initial modality** [^115BLbep] because it avoids radiation, provides dynamic assessment, and accurately identifies hernia content and reducibility [^115fi1qS]. MRI is reserved for **complex cases** or when ultrasound is inconclusive [^116EASse].

---

### Acute presentations (incarceration, strangulation, obstruction)

CT is the **modality of choice** for acute presentations, providing rapid, detailed assessment of hernia content, vascular compromise, and associated complications [^1135xHQE] [^115BLbep]. Ultrasound may be used initially at the bedside, particularly in pediatric patients or when CT is unavailable [^114X9i2R].

---

### Complex or recurrent hernias

CT is recommended for **preoperative planning** in complex or recurrent hernias, providing detailed anatomical information essential for surgical strategy [^116k8wyD]. MRI is an alternative when radiation must be avoided or when **soft-tissue characterization** is required [^116mgPb9].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Imaging for umbilical hernia is **selective**, guided by clinical context. Ultrasound is **first-line** for pediatric patients, diagnostic uncertainty, and assessing reducibility or complications [^115fi1qS]. CT is the **modality of choice** for acute presentations and complex or recurrent hernias requiring detailed anatomical assessment [^1135xHQE]. MRI is reserved for complex cases, radiation-sensitive patients, or when soft-tissue characterization is needed [^116k8wyD]. Plain radiography is generally not recommended due to limited diagnostic value [^116mgPb9].

### Repair of umbilical and epigastric hernias [^111Xh1eZ]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Umbilical and epigastric hernias are primary midline defects that are present in up to 50% of the population. In the United States, only about 1% of the population carries this specific diagnosis, and only about 11% of these are repaired. Repair is aimed at symptoms relief or prevention, and the patient's goals and expectations should be explicitly identified and aligned with the health care team. This article details some relevant and interesting anatomic issues, reviews existing data, and highlights some common and important surgical techniques. Emphasis is placed on a patient-centered approach to the repair of umbilical and epigastric hernias.

### An unusual "hernia": losing a stone is not always a good thing! [^116wqc5f]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

A 42-year-old woman presented to the surgical outpatient department with what appeared to be a strangulated recurrent paraumbilical hernia. She was taken to theatre, where exploration revealed an unexpected diagnosis: an abdominal wall abscess that had formed around what appeared to be a gallstone dropped at the umbilical port site of a laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed 10 years previously. The abscess was incised and drained and a connection with the abdominal cavity excluded. The patient made a full recovery. Complications relating to spilled gallstones are rare, but can present in a variety of ways and sometimes many years after the original surgery. They should always be considered in a patient with a history of cholecystectomy presenting with an abdominal wall mass. There is no clear evidence of the best imaging modalities to be used for investigation. Methods for reducing the risk of such complications and the principles of different treatments are discussed.

### Prevalence of umbilical hernias by computed tomography [^115Wb1Dr]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Umbilical hernias (UHs) are commonly underdiagnosed due to their asymptomatic presentation. The aim was to determine the prevalence of UHs by computed tomography (CT) in a trauma center, to assess the magnitude of their underdiagnosis.

Methods

A cross-sectional study was designed, using CT studies to evaluate the integrity of the abdominal wall. The images were obtained from consecutive cases of adult patients (≥ 18 y) from the database of the radiology and imaging service during a 4-mo period. The sociodemographic features, type of CT scan, and description of the abdominal wall were obtained and compared with the radiology report. In the case of UH presence, the transversal, cephalocaudal, and anteroposterior lengths, as well as its content, were registered.

Results

A total of 472 CT scans were included with a 67.6% (n = 319) prevalence of UH. These were most common in men (58.9%, n = 188/319), but women were more likely to have UH ≥ 10 mm (55%, n = 72/131). Of those with UH, 63.6% were unreported by radiology. The most common content was peritoneal fat (87.5%). UH had medians (interquartile range) of 9.1 mm (6.8, 12.5), 8.3 mm (6, 11.5), and 12.8 mm (8.6, 18.2) in its transversal, cephalocaudal, and anteroposterior lengths, respectively. Transversal length had a high positive correlation with cephalocaudal length (r = 0.877). This datum relationship can be explained by at least 76% due to this factor. Interobserver reliability analyses resulted in substantial reliability (ICC > 0.85 and k > 0.85).

Conclusions

CT is an effective imaging tool for diagnosing UH. There is a high prevalence among the general adult population, with a high radiologic underreporting.

### Epigastric hernias in children and the use of ultrasound in its diagnosis [^112Gz4pz]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients and methods

We retrospectively included all patients below 18 years of age diagnosed with epigastric hernias in the two participating tertiary pediatric surgical departments from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2020. The available data were screened for misclassified umbilical or incisional hernias, but none were identified. Patients were identified via the specific diagnosis codes according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Health Related Problems in the German Modification for an epigastric hernia (K43.60/K43.70/K43.90). Data extraction with anonymization at the source was carried out by specifically trained chart abstractors using a prespecified data extraction chart, which was occasionally cross-checked to ensure the quality of extracted data as recommended elsewhere. We collected information on age, sex, body weight and height, symptoms on presentation, clinical findings, defect size, the preoperative use of ultrasound for diagnosis, and operation times. As there are no clear distinctions in the literature of what accounts for a periumbilical, supraumbilical and an epigastric hernia, we used the following definitions: periumbilical hernias were those immediately adjacent to the umbilical ring but were excluded from the analysis because they frequently occur in association with umbilical hernias. Supraumbilical herniaswere those epigastric hernias that were located up to 3 cm rostral to the umbilicus because anatomical studies have shown that the linea alba may have different properties there compared with more rostral partsand are clinically thought to be different from umbilical hernias. All more rostrally located epigastric hernias were considered true epigastric hernias. Ultrasound examinations were ordered at the discretion of the treating surgeon in both centers. All ultrasound examinations of epigastric hernias were conducted by board-certified pediatric radiologists in a standardized fashion. Open repairs, illustrated elsewhere, were usually performed via a transverse incision, in some cases with larger hernias via a longitudinal incision, located directly above the preoperatively marked hernia. Subcutaneous tissue was transected using electrocautery until the hernia was reached and exposed circumferentially. Following manual reduction of the hernia or if it was unsuccessful, the herniated fat was ligated and divided, and the fascia was closed using simple interrupted sutures. Available fascial defect sizes were measured intraoperatively and taken from the operation notes. The laparoscopic approach used in this report has been described in detail elsewhere. Statistical analysis was conducted using R(V.3.5.3) with its generic stats4 package. Differences in medians of numeric variables were compared via Mood's test, and correlation analyses used point-biserial correlation from the correlation package(V.0.8.0). The normality of the data was checked via the Jarque-Bera test from the tseries package (V.0.10–52)supported by visual analysis of QQ plots. Homogeneity of variance between groups was tested via Levene's test using the car package (V.3.0–7). Symptoms and results of the clinical examination, as dichotomous variables, were compared between males and females using Barnard's testprovided in the Barnard package(V.1.8) as described elsewhere. In the jurisdiction of our ethics committees, retrospective analyses of routine clinical data with anonymization at the source are waived from institutional review board approval.

### Epigastric hernias in children and the use of ultrasound in its diagnosis [^111fkMUE]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

At the opposite site of the spectrum, there are those patients with small fascial defects: due to the difficulty of palpating them, it has been advised to regularly mark the site of the hernia preoperatively, as it may be difficult to identify it in the supine and relaxed patient. We have been able to establish this association using correlation analyses and indeed found that small fascial defects are much less likely to be found during clinical examination. The palpable fascial defect is not a prerequisite to make the diagnosis: the diagnosis is mainly established by the presence of a (para)median swelling in physical examination. The aspect of the palpable fascial defect is relevant because the swelling will often disappear in the operating room, but this can be addressed by preoperative marking of the localization of the swelling before induction of anesthesia. Consequently, the use of ultrasound in pediatric epigastric hernia has been debated: some considered it to be exceptional, as the clinical examination will almost always establish the diagnosis, while others assumed ultrasound to be useful to establish the diagnosis because in the majority of cases, the fascial defect was not detected without ultrasound. Ultrasound has been a valuable tool in the evaluation of abdominal wall hernias for decades, and due to its high sensitivity and specificity, it may be advantageous when the clinical examination is equivocal. The most relevant among these is the differentiation between umbilical hernias and supraumbilical hernias: ideally, epigastric hernia could easily be discerned from umbilical hernias due to a distance to the navel as exemplified by Tinawi and Stringeror due to a characteristic U shape of the umbilicus being pushed downward by the epigastric hernia as shown by Shastri and Gilmer. If the clinical examination alone could not allow differentiation between these two types of hernia, ultrasound would most likely do so. This differentiation in equivocal cases is also of clinical relevance, as the management differs: while epigastric hernias are usually scheduled for elective repair once diagnosed, watchful waiting for spontaneous closure for asymptomatic umbilical hernia until the age of 4 years has been recommended by a systematic review. In addition, in umbilical hernias, the defect size is associated with the odds of spontaneous closure, with larger defects being less likely to close spontaneously, so the information gained by ultrasound could even be of relevance for counseling the patient's family if an umbilical and not an epigastric hernia is diagnosed. However, ultrasound should not be part of the routine care for epigastric hernia, as it is recommended to refer patients to secondary pediatric surgical care anyway if an epigastric hernia is suspected.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® hernia [^117FMeqv]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for inguinal hernia, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, ACR 2022 guidelines recommend to obtain pelvic ultrasound, MRI, or abdominopelvic CT (with or without IV contrast) as the initial imaging in patients with suspected inguinal hernia.

### Point-of-care ultrasonography for hernia reduction: a case of incarcerated umbilical hernia [^114X9i2R]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Manual reduction of an incarcerated hernia is used to avoid emergency surgery, which comes with risks of complications and death, especially in patients with severe comorbidities. However, there are no established procedures for hernia reduction.

Case Report

We present the case of an 82-year-old man with refractory ascites due to nephrotic syndrome and chronic heart failure who developed an incarcerated umbilical hernia. Color Doppler ultrasonography allowed us to detect clearly visible blood-flow signals in the incarcerated bowel and rule out necrosis, which is a contraindication for reduction. Several attempts at manual reduction failed; ultrasonography-guided reduction revealed that fluid collection within the hernia sac was blocking the manual pressure directly on the incarcerated bowel toward the hernia orifice. After sac paracentesis (draining the fluid from the sac), the incarcerated bowel became palpable, leading to a successful reduction. Four days later, once the patient was in a stable condition, an elective surgery was performed to prevent the recurrence of incarceration. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? We believe that this is a useful report on the use of point-of-care ultrasonography for incarcerated hernia from the initial assessment of bowel viability to reasonable hernia reduction through hernia sac paracentesis according to real-time observation. An approach based on visualization by ultrasonography, and not on the operator's experience, would be rational, and we believe that this approach will be feasible for emergency physicians, who are responsible for the initial treatment of incarcerated ventral hernia.

### Surgical management of umbilical endometrioma within an umbilical hernia [^117SfV2N]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Background

Endometriosis affects about 5% of women of reproductive age and was first coined by Sampson as the presence of endometrial glands and stroma outside the endometrium and myometrium. It usually affects the pelvis, including the ovaries, uterosacral ligaments and the pouch of Douglas. Extrapelvic endometriosis is less prevalent and symptomatology varies based on site, making the exact prevalence challenging to estimate. Extrapelvic lesions comprise about 12% of lesions, and abdominal wall endometriosis (AWE) is the most common extrapelvic site.

Umbilical endometriosis accounts for about 30–40% of AWE and 0.5–1.0% of all endometriosis and can appear either as a primary lesion in the absence of surgery, also known as Villar's node after Villar first described it in 1886, or as a secondary lesion arising from subsequent scar tissue after abdominal procedures. Patients typically present with a red, purple or black umbilical nodule lesion at the umbilicus and swelling colour/consistency change (83.5%), pain (83%) or bleeding (50.9%) from the umbilicus. Diagnosis is primarily made clinically, though MRI can aid in evaluation. Endometriomas appear homogeneously hyperintense on T1-weighted imaging. Histological findings generally include the presence of endometrial glands and stroma.

Management can include hormonal or surgical therapy. Surgical therapy is typically recommended and involves wide local excision of umbilical endometriosis. Resection of umbilical endometriosis has many advantages; it has been well studied, clearly establishes a diagnosis of endometriosis and rules out malignancy. Surgical management boasts low recurrence rates, decreases risk of malignant transformation and is the most common treatment modality for umbilical endometriosis in the literature.

Conversely, medical management has had varying degrees of success. Hormonal options reported in the literature include oral contraceptives, progestins and gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues. Small studies have demonstrated symptomatic control through oral contraceptive pills, while others have seen incomplete response, which suggests it may not be curative. Furthermore, there are no sound studies that compare medical to surgical management.

Timely diagnosis and effective treatment can be crucial to improving quality of life and outcomes. In this case, we report a secondary umbilical endometrioma arising from an umbilical hernia in a patient with prior abdominal myomectomy that failed medical management and was successfully treated surgically with excision and simultaneous hernia repair.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® hernia [^116mgPb9]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abdominopelvic hernias are common clinical entities composed of a wide variety of congenital, traumatic, and iatrogenic etiologies. Any weakness in the body wall may result in hernia of cavity contents with concomitant risks of morbidity and mortality. Presentations may be specific, palpable body wall mass/bulge, or vague, nonspecific pain through bowel obstruction. This document focuses on initial imaging of the adult population with signs of symptoms prompting suspicion of abdominopelvic hernia. Imaging of the abdomen and pelvis to evaluate defects is essential for prompt diagnosis and treatment. Often CT and ultrasound are the first-line modalities to quickly evaluate the abdomen and pelvis, providing for accurate diagnoses and management of patients. MRI protocols may be useful as first-line imaging studies, especially in patients with orthopedic instrumentation. Although often performed, abdominal radiographs and fluorographic procedures may provide indirect evidence of hernias but are usually not indicated for initial diagnosis of hernia. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances in which peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Painful enlarging umbilical nodule with cyclical swelling [^113dwNAb]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Which test would be most diagnostic?
A. Abdominal ultrasound
B. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis
C. Laparoscopic evaluation
D. Biopsy of the nodule
E. MRI of the abdomen

Answers:

A. Abdominal ultrasound – Incorrect. While abdominal ultrasound can be used to diagnose and screen for complications of an umbilical hernia, it would not be diagnostic for umbilical endometriosis.
B. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis – Incorrect. Umbilical endometriosis cannot be diagnosed on radiographic appearance alone. An abdominopelvic CT is necessary in the workup of a Sister Mary Joseph nodule to delineate the source and extent of metastatic malignancy.
C. Laparoscopic evaluation – Incorrect. Laparoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosing pelvic endometriosis but does not confirm cutaneous endometriosis. While many patients with primary umbilical endometriosis have concomitant pelvic endometriosis, the literature reveals patients with umbilical endometriosis without pelvic endometriosis.
D. Biopsy of the nodule – Correct. Biopsy exhibits an acanthotic epidermis overlying ectatic glands lined by columnar-type epithelium and surrounded by endometrial-type stroma and hemosiderin-laden macrophages (Fig 2). Biopsy should be performed when cutaneous endometriosis is suspected due to the potential for malignant transformation. No malignant cells were detected in this case.
E. MRI of the abdomen – Incorrect. Magnetic resonance imaging cannot diagnose cutaneous endometriosis since radiographic findings are not diagnostic. MRI can be a useful tool for evaluating the depth of invasion of DFSP.

### Fetal anterior abdominal wall defects: prenatal imaging by magnetic resonance imaging [^113sexDM]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Abdominal wall defects range from the mild umbilical cord hernia to the highly complex limb-body wall syndrome. The most common defects are gastroschisis and omphalocele, and the rarer ones include the exstrophy complex, pentalogy of Cantrell and limb-body wall syndrome. Although all have a common feature of viscera herniation through a defect in the anterior body wall, their imaging features and, more important, postnatal management, differ widely. Correct diagnosis of each entity is imperative in order to achieve appropriate and accurate prenatal counseling and postnatal management. In this paper, we discuss fetal abdominal wall defects and present diagnostic pearls to aid with diagnosis.

### Multidetector CT of expected findings and early postoperative complications after current techniques for ventral hernia repair [^1146Pme6]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Overview of surgical techniques

Broadly defined as "a protrusion of tissues through a defect of the anterior abdominal wall", ventral hernias represent a highly prevalent but heterogeneous problem in general surgery. The European Hernia Society (EHS) categorizes abdominal wall hernias as either primary or incisional. The former group includes midline (epigastric and umbilical) and lateral (spigelian and lumbar) hernias, which are classified according to their size (< 2 cm, > 4 cm, or intermediate). Congenital or acquired umbilical hernias represent the most common primary hernias.

An incisional hernia is defined as "any abdominal wall gap with or without a bulge in the area of a postoperative scar perceptible or palpable by clinical examination or imaging from incisional hernias". Incisional hernias develop after any abdominal surgery, with an incidence approaching 20%, and are increasingly encountered because of increased life expectancy and the high prevalence of risk factors such as obesity and diabetes. Recurrences after repair of primary hernias fall in the incisional group.

### Adult abdominal hernias [^115BLbep]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2014). Low credibility.

Educational Objectives and Key Points. 1. Given that abdominal hernias are a frequent imaging finding, radiologists not only are required to interpret the appearances of abdominal hernias but also should be comfortable with identifying associated complications and postrepair findings. 2. CT is the imaging modality of choice for the assessment of a known adult abdominal hernia in both elective and acute circumstances because of rapid acquisition, capability of multiplanar reconstruction, good spatial resolution, and anatomic depiction with excellent sensitivity for most complications. 3. Ultrasound is useful for adult groin assessment and is the imaging modality of choice for pediatric abdominal wall hernia assessment, whereas MRI is beneficial when there is reasonable concern that a patient's symptoms could be attributable to a hernia or a musculoskeletal source. 4. Fluoroscopic herniography is a sensitive radiologic investigation for patients with groin pain in whom a hernia is suspected but in whom a hernia cannot be identified at physical examination. 5. The diagnosis of an internal hernia not only is a challenging clinical diagnosis but also can be difficult to diagnose with imaging: Closed-loop small-bowel obstruction and abnormally located bowel loops relative to normally located small bowel or colon should prompt assessment for an internal hernia.

### Midline incisional hernia guidelines: the European hernia society [^113iejFW]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

CT versus ultrasound

A total of two cross-sectional studies, directly compared ultrasound and CT imaging for incisional hernia diagnosis; 40 and 181 patients were included respectively. In the larger study, by Beck et al. ultrasound was found to have a sensitivity of 0.98 (95 per cent c.i. 0.93 to 1.0) and a specificity of 0.88 (95 per cent c.i. 0.79 to 0.94) when compared with CT. den Hartog et al. showed ultrasound having a sensitivity of 0.71 (95 per cent c.i. 0.49 to 0.87) and a specificity of 1.0 (95 per cent c.i. 0.79 to 1.0).

Using all the data analysed for Recommendation A, an SROC plot was produced to show the relative diagnostic accuracy for different imaging modalities (shown in Fig. 11). The only reference standard available with 100 per cent sensitivity and specificity is intraoperative diagnosis. Based on the existing evidence, tests, and comparisons available, the SROC plot shows that the most accurate investigation is CT. The second most accurate is ultrasound, which has good accuracy. The least accurate way of diagnosing an incisional hernia is physical examination. Interestingly, none of the published studies looked at the accuracy of MRI, which could be used as an alternative to CT.

### Evidence-based, cost-effective management of abdominal wall hernias: an algorithm of the journal of trauma and acute care surgery emergency general surgery algorithms work group [^116UscLR]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

This algorithm developed by the Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery emergency general surgery (EGS) algorithms working group addresses the initial evaluation and management of ventral abdominal wall and groin hernias presenting in the emergency setting. The algorithm is intended to serve as a bedside reference for clinicians. It is annotated with letters linked to corresponding text that provides the rationale and references to support these recommendations. The algorithm is not a substitute for the clinical judgment and experience of bedside clinicians and should not be considered as the "standard of care". We encourage institutions to use these recommendations to formulate local protocols but recognize that there are patient-specific factors and institutional resource availability that may require deviation from this algorithm.

Abdominal wall hernia includes ventral hernias (umbilical, incisional, epigastric, spigelian) and groin hernias (inguinal, femoral). While the majority of abdominal wall hernias are treated in the elective setting, there is a subset of patients who present to the emergency department (ED) with acute issues, including severe pain, intestinal obstruction, incarceration, and strangulation. Emergency surgery may be required for patients with an abdominal wall hernia, with an incidence of 16 to 19 emergent hernia repairs per 100,000 person-years. Presentation with acute hernia incarceration (inability to reduce hernia contents) warrants prompt repair, and concern for strangulation (compromise of blood supply to the contents), particularly bowel ischemia, is a surgical emergency that requires prompt intervention to avoid the increased morbidity associated with delay in definitive management. Identifying strangulation can be a clinical challenge as physical examination, laboratory, and imaging findings can be nonspecific. Therefore, the evaluation of patients with abdominal wall hernia in the emergency setting and the decision to proceed with operative intervention should be made using a systematic approach.

### Umbilical cord hernias: prenatal diagnosis and natural history [^1139FMMS]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to describe the characteristics and outcomes of umbilical cord hernias diagnosed prenatally.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study of all pregnancies with the diagnosis of a fetal umbilical cord hernia during a 5-year period. All women received care from a multidisciplinary team and underwent complete meticulous sonography for structural malformations as well as fetal echocardiography and amniocentesis.

Results

Between 2004 and 2009, isolated fetal umbilical cord hernias were diagnosed in 8 pregnant women. The gestational ages at the time of referral ranged from 16 to 28 weeks (median, 20 weeks). In 1 case, intrauterine fetal death occurred at 35 weeks due to rupture of the umbilical cord. All remaining cases were delivered at 36 to 40 weeks, and the neonates underwent corrective surgery with good outcomes.

Conclusions

Despite 1 case complicated by intrauterine fetal death in this study, the outcome of an isolated fetal umbilical hernia seems favorable.

### Umbilical hernia repair: overview of approaches and review of literature [^116vdZk1]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Umbilical hernias are ubiquitous, and surgery is indicated in symptomatic patients. Umbilical hernia defects can range from small (< 1 cm) to very large/complex hernias, and treatment options should be tailored to the clinical situation. Open, laparoscopic, and robotic options exist for repair, with each having its advantages and disadvantages. In general, mesh should be used for repair, because it has been shown to decrease recurrence rates, even in small hernias. Although outcomes are generally favorable after umbilical hernia repairs, some patients have chronic complaints that are mostly related to recurrences.

### The hernia-neck-ratio (HNR), a novel predictive factor for complications of umbilical hernia [^115NPva9]. World Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Umbilical hernia is a common pathology and surgical repair is advised to prevent complications in symptomatic patients. However, risk factors that predict such advert events are unknown. The aim of the study was to determine whether morphological characteristics are associated with the occurrence of complications.

Method

Retrospective review of adult patients with elective and emergent umbilical hernia repair operated from January 2004 to December 2013. The size of the hernia and the size of the neck were measured based on operative reports, ultrasound, CT or MRI images. The Hernia-Neck-Ratio (HNR) was then calculated as novel risk indicator.

Results

106 patients underwent umbilical hernia repair (70 for uncomplicated and 36 for complicated hernia) as single procedure. The median size of the hernia sac was statistically significantly smaller in the uncomplicated group (30 mm, interquartile range (IQR) 20–49 vs. 50 mm, IQR 40–71, p = 0.037). The median size of the neck was not different between both groups (15 mm, IQR 11–29 vs. 16 mm, IQR 12–21, p = 0.44). The median HNR was smaller in the uncomplicated group (1.76, IQR 1.45–2.18 vs. 3.33, IQR 2.97–3.91, p = 0.00026). Based on ROC curve analysis (area under the curve: 0.9038), a cut-off value of 2.5 was associated with 91% sensitivity and 84% specificity.

Conclusions

A novel predictive factor for complications related to umbilical hernia is proposed. The Hernia-Neck Ratio can easily be calculated. These results suggest that umbilical hernia with HNR > 2.5 should be operated, irrespective of the presence of symptoms.

### Updated guideline for closure of abdominal wall incisions from the European and American hernia societies [^117BbL8R]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

KQ2 Should trocar sites be closed in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery?

The literature search revealed five new publications including a Dutch guidelineon laparoscopy for gynaecologists, a systematic reviewon technical risk factors for trocar-site hernias, a systematic review and meta-analysisof trocar-site closure in bariatric surgery, and two systematic reviews and meta-analyses, of SILS. As the Dutch guideline did not include any new studies, it was excluded from this guideline.

Trocar-site hernia appears to be a rare complication of laparoscopic surgery, but the true incidence is probably under-reported. The low-quality systematic reviewof technical risk factors for trocar-site hernias confirmed the data used in the original guideline of an overall incidence of trocar-site hernias of 0.1–0.5 per cent, with the highest incidences at the umbilical port site and in 12-mm ports, and the lowest incidence in 5-mm trocars. In bariatric surgery, a reviewnoted an overall trocar-site hernia incidence of 3.2 per cent. This review demonstrated the incidence of trocar-site hernias to be significantly higher in studies that used imaging for their diagnosis than in studies that used clinical examination or no specific follow-up regimen (16.2 versus 1.3 per cent respectively). A recent case seriesof 79 patients who underwent a laparoscopic gastric sleeve procedure reported a trocar-site hernia rate of 21.5 per cent at the umbilical extraction site, when examined by CT after a mean follow-up of 37 months. This emphasizes the probable underestimation of the true incidence of trocar-site hernias. The review authors attempted to compare the incidence of trocar-site hernias for trocar sites that were closed or not closed after bariatric surgery, and could not detect a difference. However, owing to the heterogeneity of the studies, lack of adequate methodology and duration of follow-up for this outcome, these data were not included in the present guidelines.

### Prenatal diagnosis and risk stratification of congenital diaphragmatic hernia [^1125DBte]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Prenatal risk stratification goes hand-in-hand with postnatal management of CDH. Despite improvements in prenatal detection and prognostication of CDH disease severity via fetal imaging and genetic testing, uncertainty remains regarding the accuracy of mortality predictions and the severity of morbidity in survivors. Optimizing the prenatal care of a fetal CDH pregnancy begins with an early diagnosis, followed by referral to a CDH center experienced in both fetal imaging and advanced genetic diagnosis to allow families to be counselled accurately and comprehensively. Although US alone supports accurate prenatal diagnosis, the current standard of prenatal CDH care includes fetal MRI assessments of lung volume and liver herniation as a means of refining the accuracy of prenatal prediction.

Although existing clinical practice guidelines for CDH management include recommendations for standardized prenatal diagnosis, there is a need for international consensus on imaging modalities and thresholds for risk stratification. Additionally, there should be a commitment to validate these thresholds through outcome measurement in high-volume CDH centers of excellence that offer standardized care.

### International guidelines for groin hernia management [^116EASse]. Hernia (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for inguinal hernia, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, HSG 2018 guidelines recommend to perform clinical examination and obtain ultrasound for diagnosis in patients with vague groin swelling or possible occult groin hernias. Consider obtaining dynamic MRI or CT for further evaluation if the ultrasound is negative or nondiagnostic.

### Localized postinflammatory hyperpigmentation with abdominal wall protrusion [^1144uz67]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What is the most sensitive diagnostic test to help confirm the diagnosis?
A. CT abdomen and pelvis
B. Electromyography (EMG)
C. Skin biopsy
D. Herpes serology
E. MRI abdomen

Answers:

A. CT abdomen and pelvis – Incorrect. A CT scan may be done to exclude a true abdominal hernia or other intra-abdominal pathology. However, it is not necessary, and is not the most sensitive test. Our patient's imaging showed a small incidental umbilical hernia with no evidence of lateral wall defect (Fig 3).
B. Electromyography (EMG) – Correct. Postherpetic pseudohernia is a motor complication of herpes zoster resulting from ventral nerve root denervation, leading to paralysis of the ipsilateral abdominal wall musculatureEMG is a highly sensitive diagnostic modality that can detect this acute denervation, supporting the clinical diagnosis. Nerve conduction studies can also be combined with EMG to rule out other neuropathies; in cases of pseudohernia, nerve conduction studies are often normal. In this case, electrodiagnostic studies were deemed unnecessary given the close temporal correlation between rash onset and abdominal protrusion.
C. Skin biopsy – Incorrect. A biopsy would reveal patchy epidermal or dermal melanosis consistent with postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and not provide additional diagnostic information. Of note, a skin biopsy may be used to aid the diagnosis of a small fiber neuropathy; however, postherpetic pseudohernia is due to motor neuropathy.
D. Herpes serology – Incorrect. Serologic testing is not reliable for diagnosing acute herpes zoster; varicella zoster virus IgM may show delayed or cross-reactive responses, and varicella zoster virus IgG only indicates past exposure.
E. MRI abdomen – Incorrect. Although MRI abdomen may show increased T2/short-tau inversion recovery signal intensity in the abdominal wall muscles suggestive of acute denervation, it is not a first line diagnostic modality.

### Midline incisional hernia guidelines: the European hernia society [^116k8wyD]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Single incision laparoscopic surgery versus conventional laparoscopic surgery

A total of 32 RCTs were identified that compared incisional hernia (port site hernia) after SILS versus conventional laparoscopic surgery. The overall certainty of evidence was low. Pooled analysis revealed a risk of developing an incisional hernia of 1.5 per cent (27/1861 patients) with SILS versus 0.5 per cent (11/2156 patients) with conventional laparoscopic surgery (OR 1.92 (95 per cent c.i. 0.94 to 3.91)); see the forest plot and risk-of-bias assessment in Fig. 6.

Fig. 6
Forest plot: single incision laparoscopic surgery as a risk factor for incisional hernia

SILS, single incision laparoscopic surgery; CLS, conventional laparoscopic surgery.

Surgical site infection

It is well documented that SSI impairs wound healing. A total of nine studies assessed the impact of SSI as a risk factor for developing an incisional hernia. Pooled analysis suggested a risk of incisional hernia of 19.4 per cent (76/391 patients) after having an SSI compared with 6.9 per cent (315/4542 patients) with no SSI (OR 3.38 (95 per cent c.i. 2.18 to 5.23)); see the forest plot and risk-of-bias assessment in Fig. 7.

Fig. 7
Forest plot: surgical site infection as a risk factor for incisional hernia

SSI, surgical site infection.

There was no evidence for any other independent risk factors from the literature.

Key Question 2: (a) Do all patients with an incisional hernia require imaging? and (b) What is the best modality?

Recommendation A: For patients with a suspected incisional hernia where clinical examination has not given a definitive diagnosis, medical imaging to establish the diagnosis is suggested; from the evidence CT is the most sensitive investigation.

However, if the cost and radiation exposure are a concern then ultrasonography or MRI with Valsalva is suggested (conditional recommendation, low certainty evidence).

Good Practice Statement B: For patients with an incisional hernia (where surgery is being considered), the guidelines panel recommends using CT or MRI for preoperative planning.

Medical imaging is frequently used before surgery to characterize incisional hernias. Medical imaging may also play an important role in diagnosis where the presence of a hernia is not obvious on clinical examination.

AIUM practice parameter — first‑trimester abdominal and pelvic evaluation includes color Doppler of umbilical arteries on each side of the bladder, with sagittal measurement recommended if suspicious for anomaly; assessment of the anterior wall contour noting "No hydrops/masses"; evaluation of ductus venosus flow; and renal assessment with color Doppler of renal vessels if kidneys are not well seen. The table adds that physiologic midgut hernia should not be seen after 12 weeks 6 days, may occasionally be present and resolve later in gestation, and that genetic counseling should be considered.

### Mesh versus suture repair of umbilical hernia in adults: a randomised, double-blind, controlled, multicentre trial [^1158KqP8]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Both mesh and suture repair are used for the treatment of umbilical hernias, but for smaller umbilical hernias (diameter 1–4 cm) there is little evidence whether mesh repair would be beneficial. In this study we aimed to investigate whether use of a mesh was better in reducing recurrence compared with suture repair for smaller umbilical hernias.

Methods

We did a randomised, double-blind, controlled multicentre trial in 12 hospitals (nine in the Netherlands, two in Germany, and one in Italy). Eligible participants were adults aged at least 18 years with a primary umbilical hernia of diameter 1–4 cm, and were randomly assigned (1:1) intraoperatively to either suture repair or mesh repair. In the first 3 years of the inclusion period, blocked randomisation (of non-specified size) was achieved by an envelope randomisation system; after this time computer-generated randomisation was introduced. Patients, investigators, and analysts were masked to the allocated treatment, and participants were stratified by hernia size (1–2 cm and > 2–4 cm). At study initiation, all surgeons were invited to training sessions to ensure they used the same standardised techniques for suture repair or mesh repair. Patients underwent physical examinations at 2 weeks, and 3, 12, and 24–30 months after the operation. The primary outcome was the rate of recurrences of the umbilical hernia after 24 months assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population by physical examination and, in case of any doubt, abdominal ultrasound. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00789230.

Findings

Between June 21, 2006, and April 16, 2014, we randomly assigned 300 patients, 150 to mesh repair and 150 to suture repair. The median follow-up was 25.1 months (IQR 15.5–33.4). After a maximum follow-up of 30 months, there were fewer recurrences in the mesh group than in the suture group (six [4%] in 146 patients vs 17 [12%] in 138 patients; 2-year actuarial estimates of recurrence 3.6% [95% CI 1.4–9.4] vs 11.4% (6.8–18.9); p = 0.01, hazard ratio 0.31, 95% CI 0.12–0.80, corresponding to a number needed to treat of 12.8). The most common postoperative complications were seroma (one [< 1%] in the suture group vs five [3%] in the mesh group), haematoma (two [1%] vs three [2%]), and wound infection (one [< 1%] vs three [2%]). There were no anaesthetic complications or postoperative deaths.

Interpretation

This is the first study showing high level evidence for mesh repair in patients with small hernias of diameter 1–4 cm. Hence we suggest mesh repair should be used for operations on all patients with an umbilical hernia of this size.

### Hepatobiliary scintigraphy findings lead to the diagnosis of spontaneous common bile duct rupture in an infant [^111KdctJ]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Hepatobiliary scintigraphy is a widely used functional imaging modality for diagnosis of a variety of liver diseases, as well as for detecting biliary tract abnormalities. Neonates or infants with persistent jaundice beyond the physiological period are usually evaluated with hepatobiliary scintigraphy. The authors present a 5-month-old girl with neonatal jaundice, ascites, and umbilical and bilateral inguinal hernias in whom spontaneous rupture of the biliary duct resulted in intraperitoneal bile leak with passage of tracer into bilateral inguinal hernial sacs.

### MDCT imaging in spigelian hernia, clinical, and surgical implications [^111pg66H]. Clinical Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Spigelian hernia is an uncommon congenital or acquired defect in the transversus abdominis aponeurosis with non-specific symptoms posing a diagnostic challenge. There is a paucity of radiology literature on imaging findings of Spigelian hernia. The objective of this study is to explore the role of MDCT in evaluating Spigelian hernia along with clinical and surgical implications.

Materials and Methods

In this IRB approved, HIPAA compliant retrospective observational analysis MDCT imaging findings of 43 Spigelian hernias were evaluated by two fellowship-trained radiologists. Imaging features evaluated were: presence of Spigelian hernia, laterality, relation to "hernia belt" (between 0 and 6 cm cranial to an imaginary axial line between both anterior superior iliac spines), the hernia neck and sac sizes, hernia content, and other coexistent hernias (umbilical, incisional, inguinal). Patient's demographics (age, gender, BMI, conditions with increased intra-abdominal pressure) were also recorded for any correlation.

Results

60% (26/43) of Spigelian hernias were located below the hernia belt while 33% (14/43) within the hernia belt and 7% (3/43) above the hernia belt. The most common subtype of Spigelian hernia encountered was interparietal (84%). The mean hernia neck diameter was 3.4 cm, mean hernia sac volume was 329 cc. Hernia content included: fat (43/43) bowel (23/43), fluid (3/43). 3 patients had no clinical history provided, the remaining 37 patients' clinical presentation was asymptomatic in 73% (27/37), acute abdominal pain in 5% (2/37) and chronic abdominal pain in 22% (8/37). None of the hernia were incarcerated and none of the patients underwent emergent surgery. No significant correlation was noted between Spigelian hernia and causes of increased intra-abdominal pressure. 90% of our patients had other abdominal hernias. 30.9 was the mean BMI (20.8–69.1).

Conclusion

Most of the Spigelian hernia occurred below the traditionally described hernia belt and the majority are of interparietal subtype that can be best diagnosed with MDCT in contrast to physical examination.

### Diagnostic value of an automated breast volume scanner for abdominal hernias [^117Stx7N]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study explored the diagnostic values of an automated breast volume scanner (ABVS) for abdominal external hernias.

Methods

Conventional sonograms and ABVS images from 128 abdominal external hernias in 104 patients (98 male and 6 female; age range, 41–79 years; mean age ± SD, 68.0 ± 14.6 years) were analyzed. The results were identified by surgical outcomes. The hernia type, hernial ring position, hernial sac size, hernia content, and hernia structure were evaluated by both sonographic modalities.

Results

The sensitivity and accuracy differences between the ABVS and conventional sonography for diagnosis of abdominal hernias and hernia size measurements were compared. The hernia types, as confirmed by surgery, included 45 indirect inguinal hernias (30 reducible and 15 irreducible), 12 reducible direct inguinal hernias, 5 femoral hernias, 62 incisional hernias (42 isolated and 20 multiple), and 4 umbilical hernias. The sensitivity of the ABVS was higher than that of conventional sonography for incisional hernias (P < .01), whereas there were no statistical differences in sensitivity for other types of hernias. The ABVS hernial sac number detection rate for both isolated and multiple incisional hernias was significantly higher compared with that of conventional sonography (both P < .01). The ABVS measurements correlated well with surgical results (length, P = 0.47; width, P = 0.31).

Conclusions

Automated breast volume scanner images have the outstanding advantage of displaying the entire scope of the internal structure and the relationship with adjacent tissues of abdominal hernias. Therefore, an ABVS has good application prospects for diagnosis of abdominal external hernias and merits further research.

### Congenital hernia of cord: an often misdiagnosed entity [^116o1Fdh]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Congenital hernia of the cord, also known as umbilical cord hernia, is an often misdiagnosed and under-reported entity, easily confused with a small omphalocele. It is different from postnatally diagnosed umbilical hernias and is believed to arise from persistent physiological mid-gut herniation. Its incidence is estimated to be 1 in 5000. Unlike an omphalocele, it is considered benign and is not linked with chromosomal anomalies. It has been loosely associated with intestinal anomalies, suggesting the need for a complete fetal anatomical ultrasound evaluation. We present a case of a fetal umbilical cord hernia diagnosed in a 28-year-old woman at 21 weeks gestation. The antenatal and intrapartum courses were uncomplicated. It was misdiagnosed postnatally as a small omphalocele, causing unwarranted anxiety in the parents. Increased awareness and knowledge of such an entity among health professionals is important to prevent unwarranted anxiety from misdiagnosis, and inadvertent bowel injury during cord clamping at delivery.

### Guidelines for laparoscopic treatment of ventral and incisional abdominal wall hernias (International Endohernia Society (IEHS)-part 1 [^117AxgYu]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

C. Diagnosis — Guideline 4 states that while most ventral hernias are easily diagnosed based on clinical exam, a preoperative abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan or ultrasound may be considered for select patients with suspected ventral hernias to confirm the diagnosis or to aid the surgeon with preoperative planning (Moderate quality, strong recommendation). Diagnosis is typically made during the history and physical examination, but imaging can detect occult or recurrent hernias and assist planning: in a retrospective review of 146 consecutive LVHR's, 48% of patients had occult defects not detected on preoperative physical exam; in one study, recurrence diagnosis after mesh repair was correct 88% on physical exam versus 98% on CT; and dynamic abdominal sonography for ventral hernia diagnosis demonstrated sensitivity 98% and specificity 88%, with PPV 91% and NPV 97%, identifying hernias in a few more patients than CT. Preoperative CT is also helpful in defining abdominal wall anatomy in non-midline hernias and identifying posterior abdominal wall defects, and it accurately assesses relationships to adjacent structures and defect size to support surgical planning.

### Fetal umbilical vein deviation in congenital diaphragmatic hernia [^115kFiBU]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

Deviation of the intra-abdominal umbilical vein has been described as a marker of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) and has been shown to help identify liver herniation into the fetal chest. The purpose of this study was to quantify the degree of deviation in affected fetuses and to determine the accuracy of measurements for diagnosing liver herniation.

Methods

In patients undergoing prenatal sonography for CDH, the midhepatic portion of the umbilical vein was identified, and the distance between the lateral edge of the vein and the inner rib margin was measured. The same was done on the right, and the ratio of the left to right measurement was termed the "umbilical vein ratio". The accuracy of the umbilical vein ratio for predicting the presence and side of the hernia and for diagnosing liver herniation was determined.

Results

All but 1 of the cases with right-sided hernias had an umbilical vein ratio above the normal range, and all had liver herniation. Of those with a left-sided hernia, only 2 had a ratio within the normal range. Of those with a left-sided hernia, an umbilical vein ratio less than 0.4 was shown by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to be the best predictor of liver herniation. This cutoff had sensitivity of 89% for predicting herniation, with a false-positive rate of 14%.

Conclusions

Ninety-three percent of right-sided CDH lesions and 98% of left-sided lesions have an umbilical vein ratio outside the normal range. This finding shows that deviation may a useful indicator of CDH in screening ultrasound examinations. An umbilical vein ratio less than 0.4 is predictive of liver herniation.

### Guidelines for treatment of umbilical and epigastric hernias from the European hernia society and americas hernia society [^112MS1tj]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Umbilical and epigastric hernia repairs are frequently performed surgical procedures with an expected low complication rate. Nevertheless, the optimal method of repair with best short- and long-term outcomes remains debatable. The aim was to develop guidelines for the treatment of umbilical and epigastric hernias.

Methods

The guideline group consisted of surgeons from Europe and North America including members from the European Hernia Society and the Americas Hernia Society. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) critical appraisal checklists, and the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) instrument were used. A systematic literature search was done on 1 May 2018, and updated on 1 February 2019.

Results

Literature reporting specifically on umbilical and epigastric hernias was limited in quantity and quality, resulting in a majority of the recommendations being graded as weak, based on low-quality evidence. The main recommendation was to use mesh for repair of umbilical and epigastric hernias to reduce the recurrence rate. Most umbilical and epigastric hernias may be repaired by an open approach with a preperitoneal flat mesh. A laparoscopic approach may be considered if the hernia defect is large, or if the patient has an increased risk of wound morbidity.

Conclusion

This is the first European and American guideline on the treatment of umbilical and epigastric hernias. It is recommended that symptomatic umbilical and epigastric hernias are repaired by an open approach with a preperitoneal flat mesh.

### Epigastric hernias in children and the use of ultrasound in its diagnosis [^112Gkxvg]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Of those patients in whom the patient records were detailed enough to assess this aspect, 25 (42%) hernias could be classified as supraumbilical and 28 (47%) as truly epigastric, while it remained unclear in seven patients. Lateralization of the hernias could be assessed in 36 patients, in whom 30 hernias were localized in the midline, while three were left (two supraumbilical) and three epigastric hernias right of it. In the remaining 24 patients, the recorded information was not detailed enough to clearly answer this question. Fascial defects had a median size of 5 mm (95% CI 3–10). Supraumbilical hernias had numerically larger fascial defects with a median of 10 mm (95% CI 2 to 15, n = 7) compared with epigastric hernias with a median of 3 mm (95% CI 2 to 9, n = 17), but this was not the case statistically (z = 0.289, p = 0.773). As expected, smaller fascial defects were less likely to be found during clinical examination (r = −0.44, 95% CI −0.08 to −0.7, p = 0.021, n = 27). Consequently, those patients with a smaller fascial defect size (figure 1A) were more likely to have had an ultrasound to establish the diagnosis (r = −0.51, 95% CI −0.16 to −0.74, p = 0.007, n = 27) (table 2) compared with those with a larger fascial defect size (figure 1B). Ultrasound was used in 16 patients and confirmed the diagnosis of an epigastric hernia in all of them by visualizing a fascial defect.

### Epigastric hernias in children and the use of ultrasound in its diagnosis [^115cbvpf]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Although our study is the first to include both laparoscopic and open epigastric hernia repairs, it cannot be seen as a comparative study. A relevant portion of the laparoscopic hernia repairs were conducted in patients with specific circumstances, such as multiple epigastric hernias, concomitant repair of an incisional hernia or other simultaneous operations. Therefore, the number of comparable cases is just too small to derive a reliable result in the comparison of both techniques. Nevertheless, having both techniques within one cohort indicates that laparoscopy might indeed be beneficial if there are multiple defectsor concomitant procedures to be undertaken, while we generally favored the open approach if a single epigastric hernia was to be repaired.

In addition to the retrospective nature of our study, a further limitation is that we cannot provide the direly neededlong-term data on the spontaneous course of an epigastric hernia and the risk of recurrence following epigastric hernia repair, particularly in children with larger fascial defect sizes. Another limitation of our study is a portion of missing clinical data in several patients, which is common in all reports of pediatric epigastric herniasand thus not specifically caused by poor documentation in our centers. Administrative data might be helpful in covering these issues, although the currently available reports did not assess recurrencesor did explicitly exclude them by their study design. Another limitation is that the use of ultrasound was different between the two study centers, which is likely to have introduced additional bias besides the one that is caused by the treating pediatric surgeon deciding whether an ultrasound should be conducted or not.

To date, our study represents the largest cohort of epigastric hernias in children, increasing the available information in the literature by more than 50%. In addition, due to the routine use of ultrasound in one of the two study sites and infrequently in the other study site, our study was able to provide further insight into the role of ultrasound in pediatric epigastric hernias. Its use might be beneficial in patients in whom an epigastric hernia cannot be diagnosed clinically or if a preoperative marking of the level of the hernia was impossible, as preceding research demonstrated that point-of-care ultrasound in the operating room will reliably detect the fascial defect. However, outside this limited range of indications, ultrasound for pediatric epigastric hernia is not a necessity for diagnosis or management and would put an undue burden on radiology departments if ordered routinely. Consequently, the treating pediatric surgeon, who will see the child because a referral to secondary care is recommended, should decide whether an ultrasound examination of an epigastric hernia is necessary.

### Infected urachal cyst initially misdiagnosed as an incarcerated umbilical hernia [^112aRLXF]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Urachal abnormalities are a rare cause of lower abdominal pain. They are often initially mistaken for more common causes of lower abdominal pain, and the diagnosis is usually made during evaluation for one of these more common conditions.

Case Report

We report a case of a painful periumbilical mass ultimately diagnosed as an infected urachal cyst. Although the cyst was evident sonographically, it was misidentified as an umbilical hernia, and the correct diagnosis was not made until the patient underwent computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis before surgery.

Conclusion

Emergency physicians should consider urachal disease in patients presenting with lower abdominal pain and should also be familiar with both the clinical and radiologic findings characteristic of this disease.

### Primary umbilical hernia repair: does suture type matter? [^113dkw6r]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

This study is limited by its retrospective design and reliance on medical records, including CT scans and clinical follow-up for recurrence identification. Additionally, as a single-center study with low risk surgical candidates, generalizability is limited. A multi-institutional study with longer and more robust follow-up would be beneficial to validate these findings. Our data was also comparatively low in monofilament suture compared to braided (Ethibond). Many of our surgeons have made a transition toward monofilament absorbable repair in the last five years and collecting data going forward will increase the power for this population.

### Diagnostic accuracy of abdominal ultrasound to detect pathology that needs surgical exploration in children with umbilical discharge [^1152p6SV]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Umbilical discharge is common in children and mostly attributed to infection or granuloma. However, an underlying congenital abnormality warranting surgery might also be present. Ultrasound is the imaging modality of choice to diagnose the presence of a congenital abnormality. The aim of this study is to investigate diagnostic accuracy of the ultrasound to detect pathology requiring surgical excision.

Methods

All patients ≤ 18 years with umbilical discharge from January 2008 to September 2019 were retrospectively included. Diagnostic accuracy, i.e., sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), positive likelihood ratio (LR+) and negative likelihood ratio (LR-), were calculated.

Results

Eighty-one patients were included and 56 were operated. The ultrasound was false positive in 10 patients and false negative in 13 patients. The sensitivity of ultrasound was 71.1% (95% CI 55.7–83.6), specificity 72.2% (54.8–85.8), PPV 76.2% (64.7–84.8), NPV 66.7% (54.8–76.8), LR+ 2.6 (1.5–4.5) and LR- 0.40 (0.2–0.7).

Conclusions

This study shows that the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound for detecting underlying congenital abnormalities warranting surgery for umbilical discharge in the pediatric population is low, even with experienced pediatric radiologists. Therefore, the role of the ultrasound in the diagnostic workup and value in clinical decision making is limited.

Type Of Study

### Epigastric hernias in children and the use of ultrasound in its diagnosis [^114xYSt7]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

We included 60 patients, of which 28 were females, resulting in an almost even sex ratio of 1:1.14. The median age of patients was 39 months (IQR 24–77 months). There were no differences between sexes in terms of age and body mass index (table 1).

Table 1
Demographic details of the included patients

One patient had two epigastric hernias, and another even had three epigastric hernias at different positions of the midline. Three (5%) patients had a coexisting inguinal hernia, and four (7%) had a coexisting umbilical hernia. An incisional hernia following a laparoscopic appendectomy was present in another patient. The leading symptom on presentation was pain in 18 (30%) patients, which occurred conjointly with swelling in 15 of them, while the remaining three patients had pain without visible swelling. Swelling was present in 53 (88%) patients during clinical examination, resulting in four (7%) patients who had a history of swelling that vanished spontaneously and could not be reproduced by maneuvers to increase the intra-abdominal pressure. A fascial defect was palpable in 27 (45%) patients. There was no difference in the distribution of symptoms between sexes (table 1).

### US for evaluation of acute abdominal conditions in neonates [^114GxFrE]. Radiographics (2023). Medium credibility.

US is the imaging modality of choice for evaluation of a variety of abdominal conditions, and in recent years it has also become useful and promising as a bedside technique for assessment of acute abdominal conditions in neonates. Bedside US can help, complement, and sometimes replace radiographic or contrast-enhanced studies in critically ill and labile neonates who are difficult to transport to the fluoroscopy suite. Some of the features of bedside US can be applied as point-of-care US (POCUS) of the sick neonate. Some of the abdominal conditions in neonates that can be assessed and monitored with bedside US are necrotizing enterocolitis and its complications, malrotation with a midgut volvulus, segmental volvulus, meconium peritonitis, and complicated inguinal hernia. High-resolution US with the use of 15-MHz and higher-frequency probes allows characterization of the bowel anatomy and features of intestinal abnormalities in neonates in fine detail. Color Doppler US and microvascular imaging improve accuracy in the detection and characterization of bowel vascularity, which is important in the treatment and follow-up of patients with intestinal conditions. © RSNA, 2023 Quiz questions for this article are available through the Online Learning Center.

### Techniques, terminology, and indications for MRI in pregnancy [^116rKmxe]. Seminars in Perinatology (2013). Low credibility.

Fetal MRI is now a well-established imaging modality for the diagnostic evaluation of fetuses with congenital anomalies. In this article, the authors provide a brief overview of the physical principles involved in fetal MRI imaging, the sequences that are used in clinical practice today, current indications, and limitations. A review of current evidence supports the following indications for fetal MRI: suspected central nervous system anomalies, neck and oropharyngeal masses, diaphragmatic hernia, abdominal masses or bowel pathology not fully characterized by ultrasonography, and suspected fetal infection. Other indications should be decided on a case-by-case basis with close collaboration between the departments of maternal-fetal medicine and radiology. More research is needed to determine the role of fetal MRI in functional neuroimaging at higher magnetic field strengths (3T).

### Epigastric hernias in children and the use of ultrasound in its diagnosis [^115W46gS]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ventral hernias, among which epigastric hernias are the most frequent, accounted for 6% of all pediatric hernia repairs in an analysis of the Military Health System Data Repository of the United States. Likewise, 4% of all hernia repairs in a relatively large retrospective analysis were epigastric hernias. Despite these numbers, a recent systematic review identified clinical information on only 81 pediatric patients in the literature. Together with their simultaneously reported 36 patients, there is clinical information from just 117 patients, which we consider a relevant paucity of data. We aimed to address this by providing additional clinical information on this condition with relevant case numbers. Despite these limited data, there is a debate regarding whether ultrasound would be helpful to diagnose the conditionor not. As ultrasound is frequently used in one of our centers, we also aimed to further address this issue.

### Predictors of spontaneous resolution of umbilical hernia in children [^1164PWTo]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Results from this study demonstrate that pediatric umbilical hernias are unlikely to become strangulated or incarcerated. The probability of spontaneous resolution of umbilical hernia decreases with an increase in defect size while controlling for prematurity and other comorbidities. On the other hand, probability of non-resolution increases with prematurity. In light of these findings, factors such as prematurity and increasing defect size should continue to be considered during the management of children with umbilical hernia in Ontario. Because umbilical hernias are usually a benign condition with a very low complication rate, family physicians should encourage parents to monitor their child's condition until 4–5 years of age while being cognizant of any potential complications. Overall, conservative management is justifiable and appropriate during pediatric monitoring of asymptomatic umbilical hernia.

In conclusion, we aimed to characterize the probability of spontaneous resolution for umbilical hernia in our Eastern Ontario cohort. Overall, our study determined that the odds of spontaneous resolution were lower for premature babies and were negatively correlated with defect size. As such, continued monitoring of defect size and prematurity is warranted during umbilical hernia management of children in Ontario.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of detailed diagnostic obstetric ultrasound examinations between 12 Weeks 0 Days and 13 Weeks 6 Days [^116Jyp6U]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Fetal abdomen and pelvis — The abdomen is evaluated primarily in the axial plane at 3 levels: stomach, kidneys, and bladder; the stomach should be identified on the left and the liver on the right, the umbilical cord insertion into the anterior abdominal wall should be demonstrated, and power or color Doppler may be used to show the umbilical arteries on each side of the fetal bladder, within which fluid should be seen; the fetal kidneys may be identified most easily on the coronal view using the central hypoechoic renal pelvis as a landmark, and power or color Doppler imaging of the renal arteries is recommended if visualization is inadequate; a physiologic herniation of bowel into the base of the umbilical cord may be seen before 13 weeks' gestation and is a normal finding.

Umbilical hernia is a common pediatric diagnosis for which the initial management is usually nonoperative. The high incidence of spontaneous closure and the infrequency of complications in the first few years of life justify this conservative management strategy. The authors present a case of a 5-month-old girl with a history of prematurity and prolonged ventilatory support, who subsequently experienced bowel evisceration via a previously uncomplicated umbilical hernia.

### Prenatal diagnosis, imaging, and prognosis in congenital diaphragmatic hernia [^116jrd41]. Seminars in Perinatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Antenatal ultrasound screening identifies more than 60% of Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH) cases and provides the opportunity for in utero referral to a tertiary care center for expert assessment and perinatal management. Prenatal assessment of fetuses with CDH has tremendously improved over the past ten years. The outcome may be predicted prenatally by medical imaging and advanced genetic testing. The combination of lung size and liver position determination by ultrasound measurements and MRI are widely accepted methods to stratify fetuses into groups that correlate not only with neonatal mortality but also with morbidity. Notwithstanding this, prediction of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn still needs to be improved.

### Umbilical hernia simulating recurrent carcinoid on octreoscan [^116zmV5A]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Physiologic bowel activity on In-111 octreotide imaging is commonly seen. However, on occasion, normal bowel activity may mimic lesions in the abdomen, which can be very difficult to differentiate, particularly after surgical intervention. We report a case of focal bowel activity simulating a lesion in a patient who had an In-111 octreotide scan (Octreoscan), postoperatively, looking for recurrent carcinoid. SPECT/CT demonstrated that the uptake was localized in the anterior abdomen, and corresponded to a loop of bowel within a ventral hernia at the site of surgical incision. The correlation with CT as well as the precise localization made possible by the fusion images helped avoid misinterpretation of this finding as possible recurrent carcinoid.

### Diagnostic ambiguity of aseptic necrobiosis of a uterine fibroid in a term pregnancy: a case report [^111EDwBa]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Noteworthy, an important differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain related to leiomyoma in pregnancy is torsion of a pedunculated subserosal myoma. It is rare for a uterine fibroid to become pedunculated and it is scarcer for pedunculated fibroids to undergo torsion. Till date, the incidence or prevalence of pedunculated subserosal myoma during gestation is unknown. Available data stem from some few published case reports. The existence of a pedunculated fibroid is the primary requisite for its torsion. The pedicle of the pedunculated subserous leiomyoma must be long and thin enough to allow excess motility of the fibroid leading to the rotation and subsequent torsion of its stalk. The size of the fibroid determines the reversibility of the torsion process. As such, it is easy to correct torsion spontaneously in twisted pedunculated myomas that are small compared to larger ones. As its stalk rotates, blood vessels supplying the fibroid become strangulated, leading to ischemic or necrotic myomas. Furthermore, a twisted huge pedunculated fibroid can compress surrounding organs like the bowels leading to constipation or ileus during pregnancy and delivery, as well as the puerperal period. The diagnosis of torsion of pedunculated subserous fibroids can be confirmed by ultrasound, computed tomography or magnetic imaging resonance, the most accurate test. However, the diagnosis is often confirmed intraoperatively due to a low pre-operative index of clinical suspicion during pregnancy and limited imaging-based diagnostic characteristics, as in our case. Due to the risk of haemorrhagic infarction and subsequent infection, the approved management of torsion of uterine fibroids during pregnancy entails emergency myomectomy or artery embolization.

In conclusion, this clinical case illustrates the diagnostic difficulties often encountered in the management of aseptic necrobiosis of uterine fibroids during pregnancy. Aseptic necrobiosis of leiomyomas on a gravid uterus is may present as a strangulated umbilical hernia. It is a real differential diagnosis to be evoked by the healthcare providers. Inspite of our hospital infrastructure being deficient in sophisticated medical imaging studies for an accurate pre-operative diagnosis, we have demonstrated that an early multidisciplinary care (obstetricians, surgeons, anesthetists and radiologists) clearly improves the maternal and neonatal outcome. The value of this therapeutic approach is invaluable in a context where maternal and perinatal mortality is of increasing concern.

### The AIUM practice parameter for the performance of an ultrasound examination of the abdomen and / or retroperitoneum [^115fi1qS]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Abdominal wall — When there are signs or symptoms referable to the abdominal wall, an ultrasound examination may be performed to evaluate for hernia, masses, fluid collections, or other abnormalities, and the examination should include images of the abdominal wall in the location of symptoms or signs and often necessitates scanning with a high-frequency, high-resolution transducer. The relationship of any identified mass to the peritoneum should be demonstrated, any defect in the peritoneum and abdominal wall musculature should be documented, and the presence or absence of bowel, fluid, organs, or other tissues contained within any abdominal wall defect should be noted. Valsalva maneuvers in supine and upright positioning may be helpful in hernia detection and determining reducibility, the inferior epigastric vessels are an important anatomic landmark in hernia characterization, and Doppler examination may be useful to evaluate for vascular flow in an abdominal mass; cine clip images can be useful to further define abdominal wall hernias.

Illustrative cases

Figure 3A shows a fetus at 34 weeks and 6 days of gestation with exomphalos. The abdominal wall defect, measured in multiple planes, is approximately 5 cm in width and there is substantial herniation of the liver and a prominent and irregular-coursing umbilical vein (highlighted on the 3D model). Associated spinal angulation and a severe left congenital diaphragmatic hernia were also present, with intrathoracic loops of bowel, spleen, and stomach. The total lung volume was calculated as 16.61 cm 3. The parents chose palliative care after delivery. Detailed illustrations of the 3D reconstructed image and segmentations can be seen in videos 8–9.

Figure 3B shows a fetus at 24 weeks' gestation with gastroschisis. Loops of bowel outside of the abdominal cavity and without membrane coverage are clearly shown, and the defect can be seen to originate to the right of the insertion of the umbilical cord. This pregnancy was induced (per protocol) at 37 weeks and 5 days' gestation, the baby had primary closure at the cotside on the first day of life, and was well at follow-up more than 2 years later.

### Epigastric hernias in children and the use of ultrasound in its diagnosis [^116uPnzR]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

There is a paucity of clinical data on pediatric epigastric hernias despite them accounting for up to 6% of all hernia repairs in children. We aimed to provide additional data to supplement those 117 cases of a recent systematic review and to further clarify the role of ultrasound in diagnosing pediatric epigastric hernia.

Methods

We retrospectively included all 60 patients treated for epigastric hernias in children in two tertiary pediatric surgical departments within 12 years. Associations were tested via point-biserial correlation analyses.

Results

Epigastric hernias primarily affected preschool children with a median age of 39 months. The vast majority of patients (88%) presented with swelling that was occasionally (30%) accompanied by pain. Fascial defects could be found during clinical examination in 45% of patients with a median size of 5 mm (95% CI 3 to 10). Smaller defects were less likely to be palpable (r = −0.44, 95% CI −0.08 to −0.7, p = 0.021). Likewise, ultrasound was used more frequently with smaller fascial defect sizes (r = −0.51, 95% CI −0.16 to −0.74, p = 0.007). Laparoscopic repair was used in 11 patients (19%) and more often (4/11) in combination with another simultaneous procedure than open repair (11/48).

Conclusions

Epigastric hernias are primarily a condition of the preschool child. Ultrasound can be beneficial if the diagnosis cannot be made clinically; otherwise, it is abdicable if it does not change the management of the patient's epigastric hernia. Laparoscopic repairs might be beneficial for children with multiple defects or simultaneous procedures.

### From inguinal hernias to spermatic cord lipomas: pearls, pitfalls, and mimics of abdominal and pelvic hernias [^111Kggiz]. Radiographics (2017). Low credibility.

Abdominal and pelvic hernias may be indolent and detected incidentally, manifest acutely with pain and distress, or cause chronic discomfort. Physical examination findings are often ambiguous and insufficient for optimal triage. Therefore, accurate anatomic delineation and identification of complications are critical for effective treatment planning. Imaging, particularly computed tomography, provides a vital understanding of the hernia's location and size, involved viscera, and severity of associated complications. Reader familiarity with the imaging appearances and anatomic landmarks of hernias is important for correct diagnosis, which may impact preoperative planning and reduce morbidity. This article reviews the appearance of anatomic structures in the abdominal wall and pelvis that are important for diagnosing common and uncommon abdominal and pelvic hernias, and it highlights key imaging features that are helpful for differentiating hernias, mimics, and their complications.

### Potential for error when relying on administrative data [^115WMTCZ]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Patient-level data were extracted from the UCLA Epic Clarity EHR database, excluding restricted individuals (for example celebrities) under UCLA IRB approval (IRB#23–000174). The analytic sample included primary care clinic visits of patients > 16 years diagnosed with a hernia between 1 January 2018 and 6 June 2023. Abdominal hernias were identified by ICD-10 codes K40–K46 as the primary diagnosis. Subtypes included diaphragmatic (K44.9), ventral (K42–K43, K45–K46), and inguinal/femoral (K40–K41). When there were multiple hernia diagnoses, the diagnosis listed first was used.

For patients with abdominal imaging (CT/US), hernia diagnoses were confirmed by natural language processing (NLP) of dictated radiology reports. Sentences were parsed, lowercased, and searched for hernia-related terms. Words used to identify hernia from radiology reports: diaphragmatic — hiatal hernia, diaphragmatic hernia, hiatus, Bochdalek hernia, and paraesophageal hernia; ventral — umbilical hernia, umbilicus hernia, ventral hernia, abdominal wall hernia, Spigelian hernia, Richter hernia, quadrant hernia, lateral abdominal hernia, small fat containing upper abdominal hernia, epigastric hernia, and incisional hernia; inguinal — inguinal, groin, and femoral. Presence was determined by keyword context (for example 'was present' versus 'no evidence of'), followed by manual review by two authors (H.Z. E.L.). For multiple imaging records, the earliest date was used as the diagnosis. Analyses were conducted using R Studio v4.3.1.

### Positive predictive value of ultrasound in correctly identifying an inguinal hernia: a single-centered retrospective pilot study [^113sx8bZ]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inguinal hernia surgery is one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures worldwide. According to the national guidelines published in 2020, approximately 27,000 inguinal hernia surgeries are performed annually in the Netherlands (national guideline, 2020), of which 500 to 800 surgeries are performed in our hospital. In 95% of patients with suspected inguinal hernia, the general practitioner (GP) or surgeon can diagnose the inguinal hernia based on the clinical presentation and physical examination. When the physical examination is inconclusive, ultrasonography is indicated according to both the international and Dutch inguinal hernia guidelines. Typical findings of a hernia on ultrasound consist of a hernial sac containing adipose or intestinal tissue or protrusion of a herniating sac when the Valsalva maneuver is performed.

Several studies compared the role of ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of inguinal hernias. In a recent systematic review (2020), Piga et al. aimed to determine which diagnostic modality is the most accurate in diagnosing inguinal hernia. They concluded that ultrasound has the highest sensitivity and specificity compared to CT and/or MRI. The sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound for diagnosing inguinal hernias were 56–100% and 0–100%, respectively, whereas the sensitivity and specificity of CT scans ranged from 48 to 98% and 25 to 100%, respectively, and of MRI from 85 to 95% and 90 to 100%, respectively. In spite of the broader range in sensitivity and specificity observed, on average ultrasonography performed the best.

In a systematic review by Kwee et al. the positive predictive value (PPV) of ultrasonography for inguinal hernias was evaluated. In the 16 studies included, the PPV ranged from 58.8 to 100%. A pooled PPV of 86.4% (CI 95% [78.9–92.4]) was reported. These findings showed that PPVs are inconsistent and vary significantly between studies. Thus, additional research is warranted. Moreover, it is currently unclear which factors are associated with false positive (FP) ultrasound findings, although operator experience has already been linked to ultrasound accuracy.

A prior clinical diagnosis of hernia may explain part of the FP diagnoses, especially when there is no evident clinical sign like palpable sac or swelling. In case of inguinal pain without swelling, diagnosing hernia may be very difficult even for a trained surgeon, GP and ultrasound technician.

### Prenatal diagnosis and risk stratification of congenital diaphragmatic hernia [^116uFmpt]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging

Over the past decade, MRI has become complementary to US for antenatal prognostication of CDH in most referral centers. MRI allows for more accurate imaging of most fetal structures than US because of its superior tissue contrast, wider field of view, and image quality that is independent of maternal body habitus, fetal position, or abnormalities of amniotic fluid. MRI provides a more reliable measurement of lung area, especially on the ipsilateral side, for assessing the TFLV, that is, the sum of both lung volumes (figure 3). The methodologies, techniques, and formulae used to assess fetal lung volume on MRI vary.MRI can assess fetal lung volume with TFLV, o/e TFLV, or per cent predicted lung volume (PPLV). Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have found that o/e TFLV performs well in predicting perinatal mortality, with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.8. An o/e TFLV threshold of < 25% for predicting perinatal mortality has an OR of 11.14 (95% CI 5.19 to 23.89). The optimal window for MRI in the prenatal risk assessment of CDH is generally prior to 30 weeks of gestation, with the ideal timing falling between 25 and 28 weeks' gestation, especially if there is the option for fetal intervention. The value of serial MRI remains unclear. Some studies have suggested that MRI should be repeated > 30 weeks due to the finding of progressive reduction in lung volumes with advancing GA. Others have found no difference in the predictive value of MRI when comparing early (< 28 weeks) and late (> 32 weeks) gestational ages.

### Umbilical cord anomalies: antenatal ultrasound findings and postnatal correlation [^117V6m9D]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Umbilical cord anomalies are rare. The differential diagnosis for a cystic structure around the umbilical cord and its insertion include pseudocyst, omphalomesenteric duct cyst, haemangioma, omphalocele or anterior abdominal wall defects. Although cord anomalies can be detected through antenatal ultrasound scans (US), very often a definitive diagnosis cannot be made. This may affect the management of the infant at birth. In cases where antenatal US was not diagnostic, current evidence supports the use of MRI to help in making an accurate diagnosis. We report two cases of umbilical cord anomalies. The first case was diagnosed in antenatal US as an omphalocele, but was found to be an allantoic cyst with hamartoma on postnatal diagnosis. The second case was not detected on antenatal US, and was diagnosed postnatally as a small omphalocele with vitellointestinal duct remnants.

### Amyand's hernia: ultrasonography findings [^112dsWHQ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Amyand's hernia is described as the presence of an appendix vermiformis in the inguinal hernia sac. The incidence of Amyand's hernia is approximately 1% of all inguinal hernias. Amyand's hernia is diagnosed intraoperatively or preoperatively with radiologic examinations.

Case Report

Two cases of Amyand's hernia, with and without acute appendicitis, are reported here. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Amyand's hernia is a rare entity, and physical signs, laboratory results, and symptoms are not always helpful in diagnosis. Preoperative diagnosis of Amyand's hernia is not straightforward, and is generally an incidental finding during surgery. Imaging modalities, including ultrasound, can be very useful for making this rare diagnosis.

### Prenatal diagnosis and risk stratification of congenital diaphragmatic hernia [^117C1Me2]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a rare heterogenous disorder with varying degrees of severity. Infant survival rates in high-income countries are approaching 80% in isolated CDH; however, over 50% will have long-term morbidities. Advanced antenatal imaging, including ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging, has made it possible to prognosticate severity of CDH and to stratify risk when counseling expectant parents. Risk stratification can also better prepare healthcare teams to enable optimal neonatal management, and provide options for fetal intervention or, where legally permitted, pregnancy termination. Factors that may affect the immediate and long-term prognosis for CDH include prenatal diagnosis, gestational age at detection and delivery, side of the defect, presence of additional structural or genetic abnormalities, defect size, estimation of fetal lung volume, the extent of visceral herniation, and the delivery center's experience in caring for neonates with CDH. Optimizing the outcome for families and infants begins with an early prenatal diagnosis followed by referral to a diverse and inclusive multidisciplinary center with CDH expertise. Prediction of disease severity is supported by accurate fetal imaging and comprehensive genetic testing, and allows the care team to provide realistic outcome expectations during the counseling of expectant parents of all racial and ethnic backgrounds.

### Radiological diagnosis of dialysis-associated complications [^116Dqxs8]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Hernias

Hernias are a frequent complication because of an increase in intra-abdominal pressure and peritoneal defect generated by the catheter implantation, which occur in up to 25% of the cases of dialysis patients, mostly umbilical next to the peritoneal dialysis catheter and in the inguinal channel. They can lead to a dialysate leak and incarcerations and strangulation of bowel loops, which usually require surgical intervention (Figs. 17 and 18).

Subcapsular hepatic steatosis

Subcapsular hepatic steatosis is a rare form of accumulation of fat within the liver, first described in 1989 by Wanless et al. According to the literature, it occurs in about 18% of peritoneal dialysis patients. It is caused by the contact of subcapsular hepatocytes with insulin of the dialysate injected into the peritoneal cavity. On ultrasound, it can be identified as echogenic nodules or scar tissue or as hypodense subcapsular areas on CT, generating a signal drop on the opposed-phase weighted MRT images. Termination of dialysis can lead to a regression. Normally, no malfunction of the liver is caused, and the disease is of no clinical significance. However, it is appropriate to recognise these areas properly to prevent further unnecessary examinations.

### Frequency of potentially avoidable surgical referrals for asymptomatic umbilical hernias in children [^115Zw2aS]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The American Association of Pediatrics released guidelines in 2019 recommending delay of surgical referral in children with asymptomatic umbilical hernias until 4–5 y of age. The purpose of this study was to assess contemporary rates of potentially avoidable referrals in this cohort of children, and to assess whether rates have decreased following guideline release.

Methods

Retrospective analysis of umbilical hernias referrals evaluated at a single pediatric surgery clinic from October 2014 to August 2021. Potentially avoidable referrals (PAR) were defined as asymptomatic, non-enlarging umbilical hernia referrals in a child 3 y of age or younger without a history of incarceration. Referral indication, disposition following clinic visit, and rates of PAR were compared before and after guideline release.

Results

A total of 803 umbilical hernia referrals were evaluated, of which 48% were in children 3 y of age or younger at time of evaluation ("early" referrals). 33% of all referrals and 68% of early referrals were categorized as a PAR, and rates were similar before and after guideline release (all referrals: 32% versus 33%, P = 0.94; early referrals: 68% versus 67%, P = 0.94). Of the 333 early referrals who were managed expectantly per guideline recommendations, 2 (0.6%) developed incarceration which was managed with successful reduction and interval repair.

Conclusions

One-third of all referrals for umbilical hernia evaluation are potentially avoidable, and this rate did not change following release of American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines. Aligning expectations between surgeons and referring providers through improved education and guideline dissemination may reduce avoidable visits, lost caregiver productivity, and exposure to potentially avoidable surgery.

### Surgical management of umbilical endometrioma within an umbilical hernia [^114Gcbug]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

A nulliparous woman in her 40s is referred to gynaecological oncology secondary to umbilical pain and bleeding with menses. Examination revealed a blood-filled cystic mass within an umbilical hernia consistent with umbilical endometrioma. The patient exhausted medical management options, then pursued surgical management via umbilectomy, excision of umbilical endometriosis, lysis of adhesions and umbilical hernia repair. Surgical pathology revealed cystic endometriosis within a hernia sac. Postoperative course was complicated by a surgical site infection, which resolved with antibiotic treatment and ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage. Few theories attempt to explain the pathogenesis of umbilical endometriosis. Medical management has not been well studied but may prove to be an effective first-line adjuvant strategy. Surgical management is reported to have a low-recurrence rate. Many techniques have been described for umbilical reconstruction, but a superior surgical technique has yet to be identified. The case presented discusses the management of a secondary endometrioma in an umbilical hernia.

### Prenatal diagnosis and risk stratification of congenital diaphragmatic hernia [^116fbT1h]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a rare disorder with an estimated prevalence of 2.3–2.6 per 10 000 births. In countries with established tertiary treatment centers, 70%–80% of children born with isolated CDH survive. CDH is not a single clinical entity, but a heterogenous disorder with highly variable outcomes ranging from perinatal death to mild, if any, respiratory issues. Most (85%) diaphragmatic defects are left-sided, 13% are right-sided, and 2% are bilateral. Reported mortality rates for CDH vary, with survival rates of ≥ 90% when only liveborn infants are considered compared with 30%–40% when prenatally diagnosed cases are included. The latter figure accounts for the 'hidden mortality' associated with CDH, which includes fetal and early neonatal deaths as well as pregnancies that are terminated.

Rates of neonatal death are higher in those affected by multiple congenital anomalies and syndromes than those with isolated CDH (45% vs. 29%). With contemporary antenatal ultrasound (US) screening, 60%–70% of CDH cases are now detected antenatally, enabling early referral to experienced multidisciplinary centers which counsel families, optimize peripartum and neonatal care, and in recent years, provide an opportunity for fetal intervention in the most severe cases.

Advanced antenatal imaging has made it possible to prognosticate severity of CDH and to stratify risk when counseling expectant parents. Risk stratification can also better prepare healthcare teams to enable optimal neonatal management, and provide options for fetal intervention or, where legally permitted, pregnancy termination. Factors that may affect the immediate and long-term prognosis for CDH include prenatal diagnosis; gestational age (GA) at detection; laterality; presence of additional structural or genetic abnormalities; defect size, which is indirectly assessed by US and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) estimation of fetal lung volumesand the extent of visceral herniation; GA at delivery; and the delivery center's experience in caring for neonates affected by CDH.

This review aims to highlight the components of prenatal diagnosis that may play a role in risk stratification in pregnancies complicated by CDH.

### Prenatal diagnosis and risk stratification of congenital diaphragmatic hernia [^1168aBGD]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a rare heterogenous disorder with varying degrees of severity. Infant survival rates in high-income countries are approaching 80% in isolated CDH; however, over 50% will have long-term morbidities. Advanced antenatal imaging, including ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging, has made it possible to prognosticate severity of CDH and to stratify risk when counseling expectant parents. Risk stratification can also better prepare healthcare teams to enable optimal neonatal management, and provide options for fetal intervention or, where legally permitted, pregnancy termination. Factors that may affect the immediate and long-term prognosis for CDH include prenatal diagnosis, gestational age at detection and delivery, side of the defect, presence of additional structural or genetic abnormalities, defect size, estimation of fetal lung volume, the extent of visceral herniation, and the delivery center's experience in caring for neonates with CDH. Optimizing the outcome for families and infants begins with an early prenatal diagnosis followed by referral to a diverse and inclusive multidisciplinary center with CDH expertise. Prediction of disease severity is supported by accurate fetal imaging and comprehensive genetic testing, and allows the care team to provide realistic outcome expectations during the counseling of expectant parents of all racial and ethnic backgrounds.

Of the 60 patients, 59 received operative defect closure, which was performed laparoscopically in 11 (19%) patients, while the remaining patients were treated with open repair. The laparoscopic approach (median 52 min, 95% CI 25 to 100) was only numerically associated with a longer median operation time (z = 1.815, p = 0.07) compared with the open procedure (median 30 min, 95% CI 27 to 37). Parallel procedures influencing the operation times were common: 36% (4/11) of laparoscopically operated children had at least one parallel procedure, and 23% (11/48) of open repairs had at least one parallel procedure. Complications following the procedure were rare and occurred in only two patients, one of whom experienced a postoperative hematoma and the other of whom had persistent localized pain following the operation.

### Incidental maternal findings on fetal MRI [^1132xi7V]. Clinical Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the type and frequency of maternal findings incidentally identified during fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Materials and Methods

A retrospective single-centre study was undertaken which included all consecutive fetal MRI studies performed between July 2017 and May 2021 at a tertiary institution. Two fellowship-trained radiologists reviewed the studies independently to determine the type and frequency of incidental maternal findings of both no clinical significance (requiring no further follow-up) and of clinical significance (requiring further follow-up, work-up, and/or management). Differences in acquisition were resolved by two-reader consensus. Non-diagnostic MRI examinations or abdominal MRI examinations indicated for maternal complications were excluded from review.

Results

A total of 455 consecutive fetal MRI examinations performed in 429 women were included. Mean age was 30 years (SD 5.5 years). At least one incidental maternal finding was identified in 58% (265/455) of studies. Umbilical hernias (35%), maternal hydronephrosis (19%), and maternal hydro-ureter (15%) were the most common. Only two studies (0.5%) showed clinically significant incidental maternal findings (pancreatic pseudocyst and ovarian cyst).

Conclusions

Incidental maternal findings are common on fetal MRI but rarely require further follow-up, work-up, and/or management.

### Predictors of spontaneous resolution of umbilical hernia in children [^111pRZTo]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study sought to examine the clinical outcomes and complications of umbilical hernias as well as to identify factors for spontaneous resolution among children. In our study population, nearly half experienced spontaneous resolution of hernia by 4–5 years of age. The low rate of strangulation and incarceration suggests that if left untreated, umbilical hernia may resolve by itself. The low rate of perioperative complications (n = 33; 1.26%) and reoccurrence (n = 20; 0.76%) further suggests that repair is a safe procedure, even after 4–5 years of age. These findings are consistent with a recent American study, which stated that the rate of preoperative complications in umbilical hernia (eg, incarceration, strangulation, and evisceration) were low, occurring in approximately 1 in 1500 hernias. Overall, our study findings suggest that patients with asymptomatic umbilical hernia can be followed up safely by their family physician until 4–5 years of age, at least at our institution. Caution should be exercised when generalizing our results to other institutions across Canada.

Our study demonstrated that for every 1 mm increase in defect size, the odds of spontaneous resolution of umbilical hernia decreased by 5%. Despite 89.1% of hernias closing spontaneously at age 6, a study conducted by Walker and colleagues found that larger hernias were also less likely to close; in fact, 0% (0/21) with a defect > 1.5 cm were closed by 6 years of age. In contrast, hernia prevalence may decrease with increasing age, indicating that the majority of large hernias may close by ages 3–4 without the need for surgery. Although not statistically significant in our study, prior literature attests that comorbidities, such as childhood obesity, may impact the likelihood of spontaneous closure. Interestingly, in our study, 40% of men and 38.7% of women had spontaneous resolution of umbilical hernia; however, when examining results of the logistic regression, this difference based on gender is not statistically significant. In other words, at least in our sample, there is no difference in frequency of spontaneous resolution of umbilical hernia among men versus women.

### Antenatal diagnosis of congenital diaphragmatic hernia [^116YnELf]. Seminars in Perinatology (2005). Low credibility.

Congenital diaphragmatic hernia occurs in approximately 1 of 2200 live births and is associated with a high degree of morbidity and mortality. Poor outcome in these cases is primarily related to the presence of additional anomalies or abnormal karyotype and the development of pulmonary and cardiovascular complications. Prenatal diagnosis occurs in approximately 50% of cases. Multiple ultrasound markers have been identified as being predictive of outcome. Three-dimensional ultrasound, fetal echocardiography, and magnetic resonance imaging have been identified as additional imaging modalities that can assist in making the antenatal diagnosis and accurately assessing perinatal outcome.

### Abdominal wall hernias: imaging features, complications, and diagnostic pitfalls at multi-detector row CT [^112GDMPZ]. Radiographics (2005). Low credibility.

Abdominal wall hernias are a common imaging finding in the abdomen and may be complicated by strangulation, incarceration, or trauma. Because of the risk of developing complications, most abdominal wall hernias are surgically repaired, even if asymptomatic. However, post-surgical complications are also common and include hernia recurrence, infected and noninfected fluid collections, and complications related to prosthetic material. Multi-detector row computed tomography (CT) with its multiplanar capabilities is particularly useful for the evaluation of unrepaired and surgically repaired abdominal wall hernias. Multi-detector row CT provides exquisite anatomic detail of the abdominal wall, thereby allowing accurate identification of wall hernias and their contents, differentiation of hernias from other abdominal masses (tumors, hematomas, abscesses), and detection of pre- or postoperative complications. These findings improve the communication of imaging results to clinicians and help optimize treatment planning. Knowledge of multi-detector row CT findings in unrepaired and surgically repaired abdominal wall hernias and their complications is essential for making the correct diagnosis and may help guide clinical management.

### Epigastric hernias in children and the use of ultrasound in its diagnosis [^113LzbXi]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

In our series, four (7%) patients presented only with a history of swelling but neither a palpable fascial defect nor reproducible swelling in the clinical examination. There might be a role for parental photographs to confirm the presence of an epigastric hernia, either as a virtual diagnosisor if a mass is not palpated on clinical examination. Ultrasound may play a limited role in preoperative localization in cases where a mass cannot be palpated. In this case, ultrasound would reliably identify the fascial defect and thus enable the preoperative marking of the level of the fascial defect. One may also argue that these children might rather be observed until the hernia becomes apparent, but one of the affected children in our series was symptomatic with abdominal pain, so observation would not have been indicated, as is commonly described in seminal works. Moreover, it has been described that fascial defects in children tend to enlarge during observation or become symptomatic, but additional data on the natural progress of epigastric hernias are missing in children. In addition, many kids will find rubbing of the hernias against their clothes irritating. In addition to these aspects, it must be taken into account that epigastric hernias might have a relevant risk of non-elective repair, which would be accompanied by an increased anesthetic risk. As the literature and subsequently the opinions of pediatric surgical departments assessed by Tinawi and Stringerare divided on the point of whether asymptomatic epigastric hernias should be repaired, some recommend it, while others prefer watchful waiting, we counsel the parents on both treatment options, but usually, in our experience, the parents will opt for the operative repair.

### Imaging of anorectal malformations: where are we now? Abdominal imaging task force of the European society of paediatric radiology [^116SYoiK]. Pediatric Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Inferences and controversies

From the more recent literature since the ESPR abdominal task force recommendations published in 2017, several inferences can be outlined as follows:
Only a few small cohort studies have been published since 2017, again with emphasis on the whole spectrum of different modalities based on the personal/institutional preferences where the research is being undertaken.
How much imaging is required at birth before the decision to undergo surgery remains a complex question. Conventional radiography and a detailed early US remain the baseline. The exclusion of an associated presacral mass before any pelvic surgery (through whatever modality is available) must be emphasised. Considering the more recent literature captured in these guidelines, the suggested ESPR guideline algorithm from 2017 has been amended slightly, as per Fig. 2.
Paediatric surgeons have different imaging expectations and preferences based on their training and expertise. The spectrum of conditions is very broad and the surgery is very complex. Attendance to the imaging by the paediatric surgeon and working collaboratively as a multidisciplinary team can be very helpful to better understand the complex anatomy, especially for the more dynamic radiologic modalities.
A further push toward MRI as a single investigation/adjunct to fluoroscopy is clearly developing with results in more than one study suggesting a better diagnostic correlation with surgical findings when compared to the traditional fluoroscopic assessments. However, there has been no direct correlation with high-level US. Challenges remain when comparing MRI to other modalities and inadequate non-standardised fluoroscopic studies weaken such modality comparisons. Differing MRI protocols and techniques also add to this complexity.
Where the radiologic expertise is available, advanced US techniques can be an adjunct or indeed a replacement to neonatal VCUG at birth. However, even research groups strongly advocating for perineal US report that fluoroscopy/VCUG is still required when a fistula is identified to fully characterise it.
The role of CT, if any, is harder to justify in the context of all the above developments, except where this is perhaps the only option realistically available to the clinical team, or when associated osseous queries need to be addressed.
On a bigger picture, multimodality multi-institutional research studies should be planned with the development of one agreed work-up algorithm being the goal for these infants. The complexity and variability of these conditions, the spectrum of available modalities, some of which are highly dependent on the level of local preference and expertise, might mean that this is a difficult consensus to ever achieve.

INITIAL EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT

The workup for a patient with concerns of a ventral abdominal wall or groin hernia begins with a thorough history and physical examination (Figs. 1). It is essential that the physical examination include all potential sites of abdominal wall hernia, including the groin and perineal areas, especially in patients with more vague presenting symptoms. Incarcerated hernias, especially in the groin, can be easily missed by a more superficial examination. After the diagnosis of a hernia has been made, the specific location, surgical history, associated symptoms, and patient-specific factors will help determine the appropriate next steps in management. History should focus on the duration of symptoms, prior episodes of hernia incarceration, past surgical history, and evidence of systemic signs of illness, including fever, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, or skin changes overlying the hernia. Physical examination should evaluate the location of the hernia, the size of the fascial defect, the presence of hernia incarceration, and any redness or ecchymosis of the overlying skin. For a well-defined localized fascial defect, adding imaging to the initial diagnostic workup is of unclear benefit and is not mandatory. If there are concerns for a complicated abdominal wall hernia, based on either patient factors or hernia variables, additional workup should be considered, and laboratory evaluation should be obtained to include a basic metabolic panel, complete blood count, and lactate.
The determination of the need and urgency for surgical repair will depend on multiple factors. Patients with a reducible hernia, improvement in symptoms, no evidence of complications, and an otherwise normal physical examination should be referred for outpatient surgical follow-up to discuss elective hernia repair. Patients with concern for abdominal wall hernia complications, including strangulation, intestinal obstruction, hernia incarceration, unrelieved severe pain, overlying skin changes, or evidence of systemic illness, should be seen by an acute care surgeon. Ideally, surgical evaluation should precede imaging in patients with nonreducible hernias and worrisome findings on physical examination.
Patients with an incarcerated hernia and concern for strangulation or presence of peritonitis require prompt surgical intervention, as increased time from onset of symptoms to operative intervention is associated with an increased need for bowel resection. Signs of bowel incarceration causing obstruction (nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, and obstipation), in addition to severe pain at the hernia site, are suggestive of strangulation. Systemic signs of strangulation may include hypotension and tachycardia, with elevations in serum lactate (> 2.0 mmol/L) and white blood cell often (although not definitively) found on initial laboratory evaluation. Physical examination may also show erythema or bruising/discoloration of the skin overlying the hernia. When these findings are present, or the patient is otherwise deemed at risk for strangulation within the hernia, an emergent exploration should be undertaken, with assessment of the viability of involved bowel, reduction of the hernia, and definitive hernia repair if practical. In many cases, imaging is not required and may lead to unnecessary delay. Similar to other EGS procedures, patients requiring acute urgent operation for hernia complications are at increased risk of complication compared with their elective counterparts.
In circumstances of diagnostic uncertainty or a difficult-to-interpret examination (as can be found in obesity), imaging should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis and to evaluate for high-risk imaging features associated with strangulation. While ultrasound can be used to help with the initial diagnosis, cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography scan is preferred. Even when the diagnosis of hernia is confidently made on physical examination, computed tomography imaging can provide useful clinical information on the fascial defect size and hernia contents to evaluate for signs of intestinal obstruction or ischemia. In the absence of a high index of suspicion for strangulation, attempts should be made to reduce an incarcerated abdominal wall hernia unless it is known that the patient has had a chronically nonreducible incarcerated hernia. Acute hernia incarceration that is not reducible should prompt urgent operative intervention to reduce the hernia, evaluate for the viability of the incarcerated bowel, and repair the hernia defect.
Acutely incarcerated hernias that are reducible but have high-risk features (Table 1) on imaging or physical examination should favor urgent repair (defined as nonemergent but performed during the index admission). These features are related to the patient's presentation and imaging findings. Clinical high-risk features include persistent abdominal pain after reduction or persistent nausea/vomiting. Radiographic findings associated with a higher risk for hernia complications should be considered when determining the need for urgent surgery in patients without clear signs of strangulation. Beyond the typical signs of bowel ischemia (e.g. pneumatosis, portal venous gas, or free air), the presence of fluid within the hernia sac, a transition point of the bowel at the neck of the hernia, bowel thickening within the hernia, and inflammatory stranding in the tissue along the hernia are considered high-risk features.
While repair of a hernia on initial presentation may be ideal, patient factors or local capacity may not permit this to be reasonably performed in all settings. Patient-specific factors should be considered, including age, frailty, American Society of Anesthesia score, and preadmission anticoagulant use, as each of these variables is associated with an increased risk of complications. – Some patients with hernias that exhibit a higher risk of recurrence may be discharged but with a defined plan to repair it in the short term to minimize patients' loss of follow-up. Variables associated with a higher risk of recurrence include clinical factors and radiographic features of the hernia (Table 2). Acute onset and escalation of symptoms should be considered potential reasons to hasten repair. The need for conscious sedation to achieve a successful visceral reduction marks patients as higher risk, and they should undergo expedited repair (when performed within 4 weeks, reincarceration rates of ~2% have been reported). High-risk anatomical features include certain types of hernias with femoral and Spigelian hernias exhibiting a higher incarceration rate and need for emergent repair; therefore, these should be addressed promptly. Women with groin hernia have a higher risk of requiring emergent surgery compared with men, especially if a femoral hernia is present. The size of the fascial defect is an unreliable predictor of the need for urgent repair, but primary hernia defects between 3 and 4 cm are at higher overall risk of incarceration compared with smaller or larger defects (with a rate of 10%; odds ratio, 3.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.91–5.74; p < 0.0001). Specific measurements comparing the width of a fascial defect and the height of the hernia sack can also be used to estimate an increased risk with a "mushrooming hernia", one with a narrow neck as compared with height creating an acute angle with the abdominal wall being associated with a higher risk of requiring emergent surgery (odds ratio, 6.12; 95% confidence interval, 2.24–20.00). Similarly, a study by James et al.identified the ratio of hernia size to fascial defect (neck) as a potential aid in surgical decision-making, finding that a hernia-to-neck ratio > 2.5 predicted the need for emergent repair. Patients presenting to the ED with acute abdominal wall hernia symptoms who do not have an indication for urgent surgery are at high risk of being lost to follow-up. A prior multicenter study of patients with an ED visit for hernia-related symptoms showed that over 50% did not follow up in the outpatient clinic, with 20% returning to the ED with additional hernia-related complaints. Considering socioeconomic factors and health care disparities to determine the need for operative intervention at the index admission will address low clinic follow-up rates and prevent future ED resource utilization. When immediate repair is not required, an effort should be made to ensure follow-up and initiate planning for definitive repair before the patient is discharged from the ED or the inpatient setting. The ability to follow-up in the outpatient clinic and access to elective, outpatient surgery should also be considered.
Nonurgent repair or repair after patient optimization prior to surgery can be pursued for symptomatic hernias without high-risk features. These patients can likely be safely discharged from the ED with elective outpatient follow-up. If modifiable patient risk factors are identified at the time of hernia diagnosis (such as smoking, need for weight loss, or control of diabetes), these should be addressed before surgery. If the hernia is deemed complex, its eventual repair should be scheduled when patient optimization has been achieved and performed by a surgeon experienced in complex abdominal wall reconstruction techniques. Prediction of the need for component separation can be a subjective determination or made in various ways using data from cross-sectional imaging comparing aspects of the hernia to the remaining abdominal wall. Watchful waiting and outpatient follow-up may be considered for asymptomatic ventral, inguinal, and umbilical hernias found incidentally on imaging. While these have a reasonably high rate of requiring an eventual repair, it is likely safe to monitor these hernias after the patient has received counseling on monitoring the hernia for symptoms in the future.

Careful assessment of fetal anatomy by a combination of ultrasound and fetal magnetic resonance imaging offers the clinical teams and counselors caring for the patient information that can be critical for the management of both the mother and the fetus. In the second half of this 2-part review, we focus on space-occupying lesions in the fetal body. Because developing fetal tissues are programmed to grow rapidly, mass lesions can have a substantial effect on the formation of normal adjacent organs. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia and lung masses, fetal teratoma, and intra-abdominal masses are discussed, with an emphasis on differential etiologies and on fundamental management considerations.

### Fetal body MRI and its application to fetal and neonatal treatment: an illustrative review [^115VrvJQ]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2021). High credibility.

Congenital diaphragmatic hernia

Congenital diaphragmatic hernia has an estimated prevalence of one per 2000–4000 pregnancies and results in a herniation of abdominal viscera into the chest. Consequently, the developing lungs are abnormal in terms of airspace volume and vasculature, on both the affected and the contralateral side. Postnatal morbidity and mortality result from ventilation difficulties, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiac failure.

In expert centres, antenatal measures of disease severity have been shown to be as accurate as measures taken after birth, affirming the importance of the standardisation of fetal assessment. Ultrasound can predict outcomes in congenital diaphragmatic hernia with reasonable accuracy using the ultrasound measurement of observed-to-expected lung-to-head ratio. This ratio takes the size of the contralateral lung in a single plane as a surrogate measurement for total lung volume, and remains the most commonly used antenatal prognostic indicator. Several previous studies have failed to show the superiority of MRI in predicting outcome compared with observed-to-expected lung-to-head ratio;, however, MRI is able to give a more objective and reproducible estimate of the total lung volume (figure 2), which has been shown to be a defining measure of long-term postnatal oxygen requirement. Although fetal interventions such as fetoscopic endotracheal occlusion are done on the basis of ultrasound measurement of observed-to-expected lung-to-head ratio, MRI might soon become a more accurate way to stratify patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia.

Most 3D-image reconstruction techniques for assessing the fetal lung have been able to detect only severe cases of pulmonary hypoplasia. However, novel motion-correction and reconstruction approaches (eg, deformable slice-to-volume registration reconstruction) can reliably produce volumetric measurement, even from motion corrupted sequences (appendix p 1, figure 2, figure 3A, videos 6–7). Work to produce normative lung volumes throughout gestation is ongoing; as such, the prognostic relevance of these measurements is currently anecdotal. Spatial anatomical relations are shown much more clearly on fetal MRI than ultrasound, thereby allowing precise location of the lung, liver, stomach, and bowel (figure 2). This capacity has important prognostic implications, because the presence of liver within a hernia is well recognised as a poor prognostic marker. The dimensions of the hernia defect are important determinants of operative technique and postoperative course, and MRI has even been used to produce 3D-bioprinted patches for defect coverage. Looking to the future, accurate sizing of a patch would be an important step in the preparation of tissue-engineered solutions.

### Umbilical paracentesis for acute hernia reduction in cirrhotic patients [^112Uqi17]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Emergent repair of umbilical hernias in cirrhotic patients is associated with a high risk for morbidity and mortality. We propose a new technique, umbilical paracentesis, for reduction of incarcerated hernias in the patient with ascites. Under ultrasound guidance, removal of ascitic fluid from the umbilical hernia sac can reduce the local pressure and thereby allow for easy hernia reduction, thus avoiding the need for an emergent operation.

Another limitation is the potential of bias in symptomatic patients, as all patients were aware of the purpose of the study when accepting inclusion, but this is in part contradicted by the fact that so few of them reported symptoms of TSH or own belief in that they had this condition. Perhaps the main limitation is the large number of our patients having been subjected to abdominal surgery prior to or after the bariatric procedure, thereby making our results not undeniably connected to the gastric sleeve. Of the 21 patients with previous abdominal surgery (Table 2), six had midline incisions and none of them had a hernia in our study, but two hernias (both at the umbilical trocar site) were found in patients with previous laparoscopy. Also, there may have been undetected preexisting umbilical hernias in previously non-operated patients. In three patients, an umbilical hernia was suspected at clinical examination documented in the patient journal at any time previous to the gastric sleeve, none of them had any mentioning of umbilical hernia in the surgeon's documentation from the gastric sleeve operation. The reason these patients were included was the large difficulty in obtaining enough patients willing to participate to maintain an adequate power. To partly account for these limitations, careful reviewing of relevant medical records, including the surgeon's documentations of procedures, descriptions of clinical examinations and imaging have been made, for as full disclosure as possible. Procedures not engaging the upper abdomen, umbilical region or midline are not reported in the study.

The clinical relevance of these hernias is due to the fact that they can lead to significant morbidity such as bowel obstruction and strangulation and require acute surgery. But the proportion of the symptomatic cases is poorly understood. None of the 79 patients in our study had up to follow-up been subjected to hernia repair. In the survey sent out to the patients asking them to answer questions regarding their experience of TSH related symptoms, only a few reported discomfort or pain from the trocar sites, and there was no significant correlation of those who did to those with TSH at CT. Nevertheless, our results of an alarming 21.5% incidence of TSH are in line with other recent data, and bearing in mind the high number of laparoscopic procedures performed, even a small proportion of symptomatic TSH can amount to a significant patient suffering and strain on the welfare systems. To further understand the relevance of symptomatic TSH and TSH repair, we are presently conducting a larger register study of more than forty thousand patients laparoscopically operated for obesity in Sweden.

### The preservation of umbilical blood supply in combined ventral hernia repair and abdominoplasty: a narrative review [^1168XR3A]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

To better assess each technique's effectiveness, comparative studies are required. A systematic review provides the best evidence; however, this is unfeasible in the setting of low numbers of controlled trial studies and inconsistent reporting of outcomes among existing studies. A randomized controlled trial could be designed to compare the techniques, for example, comparing the effectiveness of the laparoscopic versus pre-rectus approach, and to better report the outcomes, the incidence and severity of complications.

Introducing abdominoplasty to ventral hernia repair potentially provides advantages; however, it is imperative to underscore that the efficient reconstruction of the abdominal wall should be prioritized over preserving umbilical vascularization. In instances where sacrificing the umbilicus is unavoidable and necessary, for example, umbilical hernias encroaching on the umbilical stalk, the failure to preserve the umbilicus is not a catastrophic outcome. Furthermore, umbilical necrosis often heals well and is an aesthetic rather than a medical complication, which may be followed by umbiliconeoplasty.

### Cord structure within an inguinal hernia: could the ureter be involved? [^114FErTd]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Investigations

Ultrasound imaging of the abdomen and pelvis was performed at another facility prior to presenting to our outpatient clinic, which revealed a fat-containing left indirect inguinal hernia extending into the left scrotal sac. No hernia was appreciated in the right groin, nor was a primary malignancy identified. The physical examination findings, as well as imaging, were consistent with a left-sided incarcerated inguinal hernia.

Preoperative laboratory investigations included full blood count (FBC), creatinine and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). All of the mentioned tests were within normal range.

### Case of spigelian hernia with incarcerated appendix [^112su3aS]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Spigelian hernias are uncommon lateral ventral wall hernias with a significant rate of incarceration; these hernias often produce nonspecific clinical signs and symptoms as well as elusive imaging findings. Although there are reported cases of incarcerated appendices within Spigelian hernias, this case specifically illustrates the diagnostic difficulty these hernias present to both surgeons and radiologists. Additionally, we discuss important anatomy, demographics and risk factors, clinical symptoms, imaging pitfalls and recommendations for repair based on a review of literature.

### Congenital diaphragmatic hernia [^114Wcnaw]. Pediatric Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a potentially severe anomaly that should be referred to a fetal care center with expertise in multidisciplinary evaluation and management. The pediatric radiologist plays an important role in the evaluation of CDH, both in terms of anatomical description of the anomaly and in providing detailed prognostic information for use in caring for the fetus and pregnant mother as well as planning for delivery and postnatal care. This article reviews the types of hernias, including distinguishing features and imaging clues. The most common methods of predicting severity are covered, and current fetal and postnatal therapies are explained. The author of this paper provides a handy reference for pediatric radiologists presented with a case of CDH as part of their daily practice.

### Point-of-care ultrasound identification of an abdominal hernia [^114UXvbm]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2017). Low credibility.

Pediatric emergency medicine physicians may be able to use point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) as a tool to evaluate abdominal wall masses. We present a case of a 2-month-old infant with a lower abdominal mass identified as a hernia sac by POCUS. It was initially thought to represent a Spigelian-type abdominal wall hernia but subsequently determined to be an unusual presentation of an inguinal hernia with testicular entrapment. We review each of these diagnoses in addition to relevant POCUS findings.

Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is one of the best known malformations requiring surgical repair in newborns and young infants. Two main types are posterolateral, Bochdalek hernia accounting for the majority (90%) and about 80% being left sided, and anterior Morgagni hernia which is more common on the right side. Depending on the location and size of the hernia abdominal organs move into the chest cavity compressing and displacing normal structures. Since this compression is already present in fetal life normal genesis of both ipsi- and contralateral lung is altered. The degree of consequent lung hypoplasia is the major determinant of postnatal prognosis. Clinical signs of severe respiratory distress are present from birth in severe cases, while mild cases may manifest later. Prenatal ultrasound has variable performance, it can detect about 60% of the cases by the 24th gestational week. Prenatal MRI enables better differentiation of abdominal structures herniated in the chest. The severity of pulmonary hypoplasia is most reliably assessed by lung volume measurement which is currently most accurately measured on MRI images. After birth conventional radiography of the chest and abdomen shows partial opacification of a hemithorax with contralateral shift of the mediastinum with displaced NG tube. Later when the GI tract is air-filled bowel loops or stomach are identified in the chest instead of the normal intraabdominal location. CT or postnatal MRI is seldom performed in CDH, mainly in cases where differential diagnostic information is needed.

Imaging the small Airways in Children: why, when and how?

Catherine M. Owens

Why and When?

Diseases affecting the small airways in children can be difficult to detect when using traditional diagnostic tests. Indeed widespread airway involvement is usually present before we are able to demonstrate either clinical symptomatology, abnormalities on basic pulmonary function testing, or abnormal plain chest radiographs. Bronchiolar obstruction may be detected indirectly, by computed tomography (CT), manifest as regional under-ventilation and air trapping. This in turn will result in the body's homeostatic mechanisms then causing reduced pulmonary arterial perfusion to these nonfunctional (area of obstructive over inflated) airways. On CT this is manifest as oligaemia and more hyper lucent lung contributing to the 'mosaic attenuation' within the lung parenchyma.

### Inguinal hernias: diagnosis and management… [^115VMjV4]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Hernias may be easily diagnosed with an adequate physical examination. The physical examination should begin by carefully inspecting the femoral and inguinal areas for bulges while the patient is standing. Then, the patient should be asked to strain down while the physician observes for bulges. This may be accomplished by using the right hand to examine the patient's right side and the left hand to examine the patient's left side. The physician invaginates the loose skin of the scrotum with the index finger on the ipsilateral side of the patient, starting at a point low enough on the scrotum to reach as far as the internal inguinal ring. Starting on the scrotum, the examining finger follows the spermatic cord upward above the inguinal ligament to the triangular, slit-like opening of the external inguinal ring. The external inguinal ring is medial to and just below the pubic tubercle. The inguinal canal is gently followed laterally in its oblique course.

While the examining finger is in the canal next to the internal inguinal ring, the patient strains down or coughs as the physician feels for any palpable herniation. 9 The diagnosis of an inguinal hernia is confirmed if an "impulse" or bulge is felt. Imaging Although imaging is rarely needed to diagnose a hernia, it may be useful in certain clinical situations. 8 The clinical use of ultrasonography has shown promise in these situations. 11, 12 The sensitivity of ultrasonography for the detection of groin hernias is greater than 90%, and the specificity is 82% to 86%. 8, 13. Use of higher resolution axial computed tomography in the diagnosis of inguinal hernia is being investigated. 14 Magnetic resonance imaging may be useful in differentiating inguinal and femoral hernias with a high sensitivity and specificity.

8 The use of magnetic resonance imaging is helpful in the diagnosis of athletic pubalgia or sports hernias, which may occur at any age with potentially more than one cause. The physician may consider magnetic resonance imaging in the workup of patients with activity-related groin pain when no inguinal hernia can be identified on physical examination. 15.

### Role of imaging in the diagnosis of occult hernias… [^1137xgko]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

Axial CT through the pelvis is nondiagnostic for an operatively confirmed right inguinal hernia. Axial, sagittal, and coronal T2 half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin-echo MRI through the pelvis in the same patient reveals right inguinal hernia. Objective To determine the effectiveness of imaging — ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging — in the diagnosis of occult inguinal hernia. Design, Setting, and Participants. A "hidden hernia" is a clinically significant occult hernia wherein physical examination fails to demonstrate a reducible mass or defect, but a hernia is identified on surgical exploration. 2 Although a hernia repair resolves the patient's presenting symptoms, 3 surgical exploration of every patient with groin or pelvic pain would result in unnecessary procedures.

A more definitive diagnosis of hidden hernia requires imaging as part of the workup to confirm the clinical suspicion; this may include ultrasonography of the groin, computed tomography of the pelvis, and/or magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for diagnosis of occult inguinal hernia were calculated for each imaging modality. In circumstances of missed diagnosis of occult inguinal abnormalities when multiple imaging studies had been performed, a comparison was made to determine the ideal modality for evaluation. Of the 126 inguinal regions evaluated with preoperative imaging, 18 US studies, 99 CT studies, and 45 MRI studies were acquired. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated the greatest sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value. Positive predictive values were comparable.

The only patient with false-positive MRI findings was found to have a surgically correctable abnormality at exploration, and no inguinal hernia was observed. Analysis of our experience confirms this suspicion. Magnetic resonance imaging is by far the most sensitive, specific, and reliable modality to diagnose inguinal hernias. This compares with the very low performance of CT. Ultrasonography historically has been the first line of approach for evaluation of inguinal hernias. Our data show that US may be a good first-line diagnostic tool for patients with typical physical examination findings of inguinal hernias, but it is of poor reliability for evaluating any patient with a possible occult hernia.

### Routine imaging is not needed for groin hernia diagnosis… [^115VvVXM]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

To the Editor: Groin hernias are one of the most common surgical conditions evaluated by primary care physicians, with 1. 6 million cases diagnosed and 500, 000 surgeries performed annually in the United States. 1 Diagnosis is made by obtaining a thorough history and performing a clinical examination of the groin; the latter has a sensitivity of 74. 5% and specificity of
96. 3%.
2. Imaging is often performed despite the recommendation that a groin hernia diagnosis should be predominantly based on physical examination, according to international guidelines adopted by the American Hernia Society. 3 Ultrasonography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging may be a useful diagnostic adjunct, specifically in detecting femoral hernias or symptomatic occult hernias, which are undetectable by physical examination alone. 4 However, a recent U. S.

study showed that almost 50% of patients planning to undergo surgical evaluation for groin hernia repair had unnecessary preoperative imaging. 5 A Canadian study showed that more than 70% of patients with groin hernia had ultrasonography performed before surgical consultation, and only 1. 5% of those cases resulted in surgery based on the findings. 6 Imaging of the groin for hernia diagnosis and interpretation of the findings generate significant costs and an unnecessary burden to the health care system. Choosing Wisely guidelines from the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons recommend against the routine use of imaging for the diagnosis of clinically apparent groin hernias. Fundamental tenets of groin hernia care include obtaining a thorough history, performing a clinical examination, and early surgical consultation. In cases of diagnostic uncertainty, early referral to surgery is warranted. The surgeon should determine the best imaging modality.

Positive imaging results alone rarely determine whether patients undergo surgery; therefore, surgeons may diagnose alternative causes of groin pain. As high costs substantially impede access and reduce equity for patients with fewer financial resources, a "less is more" approach to the diagnosis of groin hernia would have positive impacts on patient care.

### Avoid the routine use of ultrasound in evaluating clinically… [^116TfY7C]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of, and subsequent treatment decisions for, palpable abdominal wall hernias are reliably made by patient history and physical examination alone. While the use of ultrasonography has been shown to be of some benefit in the diagnosis of occult hernias, there is no place for its routine use in the setting of a clearly palpable defect, as it only adds unnecessary cost and treatment delay with no useful contribution to definitive surgical care.
