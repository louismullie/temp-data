## Question

anxiety causing pimples

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether anxiety can cause pimples. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiology of acne vulgaris. Then, I should verify the biological plausibility of stress and anxiety influencing those pathways. Next, I will examine direct and indirect clinical evidence linking anxiety to acne flares. After that, I need to consider confounding and bidirectionality. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious conclusion and outline practical clinical implications for management and counseling.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology of acne so I don't jump to conclusions. Acne vulgaris arises from four interacting factors: increased sebum production, abnormal follicular keratinization, proliferation of Cutibacterium acnes, and local inflammation; hormonal influences, especially androgens, and genetic susceptibility modulate risk, and inflammation may begin subclinically even before visible lesions appear [^2f739262] [^e601ae5e].

> Now, I need to check whether anxiety could plausibly perturb these axes. Anxiety activates the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and the sympathoadrenal medullary system, increasing cortisol and catecholamines; cortisol can stimulate sebaceous glands and CRH signaling can upregulate sebocyte lipogenesis and androgen conversion, while stress neuropeptides can amplify cutaneous inflammation, providing a mechanistic bridge from anxiety to acne biology [^7be42a9a] [^ac2c01fd].

> Wait, let me verify direct clinical signals. A small study in acne patients found that higher state anxiety correlated with increased salivary alpha-amylase activity and higher normetanephrine levels within acne lesions, supporting SAM activation in anxious patients with acne; importantly, these markers did not correlate with acne severity, suggesting anxiety-related neuroendocrine changes may be present even when disease severity is modest, which aligns with the concept that stress can modulate acne biology independent of lesion count [^59ea24d2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality. Much of the literature is observational and bidirectional: acne causes distress, and distress may worsen acne. Large epidemiologic data show acne is associated with higher odds of anxiety and depression, and patients frequently report stress as a trigger, but these designs cannot prove directionality; nonetheless, the convergence of patient-reported triggers, physiologic plausibility, and controlled stress paradigms strengthens the case for anxiety as an exacerbating factor rather than a primary cause [^140f6ed5] [^7be42a9a] [^06faa1eb].

> I should double-check indirect evidence that stress-reduction approaches affect skin outcomes. Biofeedback-assisted relaxation and cognitive imagery have shown benefit in acne, and mindfulness-based strategies reduce distress in dermatology patients; while high-quality acne-specific RCTs are limited, these data support the concept that modulating the stress response can improve both psychological symptoms and, in some cases, skin disease activity, reinforcing a mind–skin link [^7be42a9a] [^846f5a8a] [^4f332754].

> But wait, what if anxiety mainly worsens behaviors that aggravate acne rather than changing skin biology directly. Anxiety can increase face-touching, picking, and poor sleep or dietary choices, all of which can worsen acne; excoriation disorder is a recognized comorbidity in some patients with acne, underscoring how anxiety-driven behaviors can amplify lesions and scarring, so I need to ensure I consider behavioral pathways alongside endocrine and neurogenic ones [^ab0c8464] [^0251b5de].

> Let me synthesize cautiously. Anxiety does not "cause" acne in the sense of initiating the disease in someone without predisposition, but it can exacerbate acne via neuroendocrine activation of sebaceous function, amplification of cutaneous inflammation, and maladaptive behaviors; the evidence spans mechanistic studies, observational associations, and small interventional data, with the most defensible conclusion being that anxiety is a recognized exacerbating factor in acne pathophysiology rather than a primary etiologic cause [^2f739262] [^7be42a9a] [^ac2c01fd].

> Next, I should review clinical implications so the answer is actionable. I need to ensure we screen for anxiety and stress in patients with acne, especially when flares coincide with psychosocial stressors, and consider stress-management strategies, mindfulness-based interventions, or CBT as adjuncts; in parallel, treat acne proactively to reduce the psychosocial burden, because improving skin can reciprocally lessen anxiety and improve quality of life, creating a virtuous cycle rather than a vicious one [^0251b5de] [^846f5a8a] [^baeaad51].

---

Anxiety can trigger or worsen acne by activating the **stress response**, which increases cortisol and androgens, stimulates sebum production, and promotes inflammation [^7be42a9a] [^ac2c01fd]. This creates a vicious cycle: anxiety worsens acne, and acne worsens anxiety [^140f6ed5]. Management should address both skin and mind — using acne treatments plus stress reduction, mindfulness, or CBT — to break the cycle and improve outcomes [^846f5a8a] [^0251b5de].

## Physiological mechanisms linking anxiety to acne

Anxiety activates the **HPA axis**, increasing cortisol and androgens, which stimulate sebaceous glands and sebum production, and can worsen acne [^7be42a9a]. Stress also triggers inflammation and can alter the skin microbiome, further aggravating acne [^ac2c01fd].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the anxiety-acne link

Observational studies show higher anxiety rates in acne patients, with anxiety correlating with acne severity [^140f6ed5] [^06faa1eb]. Experimental work shows stress can acutely worsen acne, and anxiety-related behaviors (e.g. picking) further inflame lesions [^7be42a9a] [^ab0c8464].

---

## Psychological impact of acne on anxiety

Acne causes appearance-related distress, social anxiety, and reduced self-esteem, which can intensify anxiety and create a **bidirectional cycle** [^140f6ed5] [^7a4e1db9]. This loop can sustain or worsen both conditions if untreated [^0c0694b7].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Effective care should treat both acne and anxiety using a **multidisciplinary approach**:

- **Acne management**: Topical retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, antibiotics, hormonal therapy, or isotretinoin for severe cases [^baeaad51] [^dd1b69c5].
- **Anxiety management**: CBT, mindfulness, stress reduction, and SSRIs or SNRIs when indicated [^846f5a8a] [^0251b5de].
- **Patient education**: Explain the anxiety–acne link and provide coping resources [^7be42a9a].

---

## Conclusion

Anxiety can precipitate or exacerbate acne via stress hormones, sebum, and inflammation, and acne can worsen anxiety; **treating both together** yields the best outcomes [^7be42a9a] [^140f6ed5].

### Acne vulgaris and risk of depression and anxiety: a meta-analytic review [^140f6ed5]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Several studies have shown an association of acne vulgaris with depression and anxiety, but a quantitative review has not yet been conducted.

Objective

We sought to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis that elucidates the association of acne vulgaris with depression and anxiety.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis of literature published before October 1, 2019 from the PubMed, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and Cochrane databases was conducted. We used a metaanalytic approach to perform a random effects analysis comparing individuals with and without acne. Subgroup analyses between studies included age, study setting, and geographic region.

Results

Forty-two studies were included. We found a significant association of acne vulgaris with depression (r = 0.22 [95% confidence interval 0.17–0.26, P < .00001]) and anxiety (r = 0.25 [95% confidence interval 0.19–0.31, P < .00001]). Subgroup analyses and comparisons showed moderating influences based on factors including age, study setting, and geographic region.

Limitations

Inconsistency between publications regarding acne and outcome ascertainment, data reporting, and studies with no control group posed considerable barriers to synthesizing all available published literature.

Conclusions

Because of an increased risk for depression and anxiety, clinicians should pursue aggressive treatment of acne and consider psychiatric screening or referrals.

### Guidelines for treating acne [^0afef6bc]. Clinics in Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Acne, a chronic inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous units of the face, neck, chest, and back, is the most common skin disorder occurring universally, with an estimated prevalence of 70–87%.(1) It is a pleomorphic disorder characterized by both inflammatory (papules, pustules, nodules) and noninflammatory (comedones, open and closed) lesions. Grading of acne is mandatory to determine the appropriate therapeutic strategy. Mild acne can be purely comedonal or mild papulopustular, with a few papulopustules present as well.(2) Moderate acne is characterized by numerous comedones, few to many pustules, and few small nodules, with no residual scarring.(2) In severe acne papulopustules are numerous, many nodules can be detected, inflammation is marked, and scarring is present.(2) Very severe acne can be recognized by sinus tracts, grouped comedones, many deeply located nodules, and severe inflammation and scarring.(2) Although acne does not affect health overall, its impact on emotional well-being and function can be critical and is often associated with depression, anxiety, and higher-than-average unemployment rates.(3) Effective treatment can dramatically improve a person's quality of life.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acne [^153ace4f]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Acne can cause significant embarrassment and anxiety in affected patients. It is important for family physicians to educate patients about available treatment options and their expected outcomes. Topical retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, sulfacetamide, and azelaic acid are effective in patients with mild or moderate comedones. Topical erythromycin or clindamycin can be added in patients with mild to moderate inflammatory acne or mixed acne. A six-month course of oral erythromycin, doxycycline, tetracycline, or minocycline can be used in patients with moderate to severe inflammatory acne. A low-androgen oral contraceptive pill is effective in women with moderate to severe acne. Isotretinoin is reserved for use in the treatment of the most severe or refractory cases of inflammatory acne. Because of its poor side effect profile and teratogenicity, isotretinoin (Accutane) must by prescribed by a physician who is a registered member of the manufacturer's System to Manage Accutane-Related Teratogenicity program.

### Does isotretinoin cause depression and anxiety in acne patients? [^a77e54cf]. Dermatologic Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Acne is the most common skin disease, and isotretinoin is the most powerful drug among the various drugs used for its treatment. A causal relationship has not yet been established between isotretinoin use and depression. The aim of this study is to research the effect of isotretinoin treatment on depression in a group of patients undergoing isotretinoin therapy. Behavioral tests measuring anxiety and depression, and the measures assessing acne severity and quality of life were applied to 112 acne patients consulted at Dermatology Clinic of Beyazit Medico Social Center of Istanbul University. In this study, 72 acne patients (61 females and 11 males) were evaluated. A significant decrease was observed in HAD-D, GAGS, and CADI scores at the end of the therapy. There was no significant relationship between patients' depression history and HAD-D scores at the end of first month of therapy and at the end of treatment. Although the psychiatrists are concerned about the potential psychiatric side effects of isotretinoin, our data support no causal relationship between isotretinoin use and depression in acne patients.

### Acne: inflammation [^c8cfba92]. Clinics in Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

The inflammatory stage of acne vulgaris is usually of greatest concern to the patient. A number of morphologically different inflammatory lesions may form that can be painful and unsightly. In 30% of patients, such lesions lead to scarring(1). Inflammatory acne and acne scarring can have significant psychological effects on the patient, including depression, anxiety, and poor self-image(2). Although inflammatory acne has been well characterized clinically, the mechanisms by which inflammatory lesions arise are still poorly understood. The human skin commensal bacterium, Propionibacterium acnes, has long been associated with inflammatory acne. This organism has been implicated over and above all of the other cutaneous microflora in contributing to the inflammatory response characteristic of acne. However, its precise role in the disease and its interaction with the human immune system remain to be elucidated.

### Is it really ever' just acne'? Considering the psychodermatology of acne [^26fbee2e]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Acne can create a significant burden for people of all ages. However, the psychological consequences might often be overlooked. This review comments on recent evidence in the field of psychodermatology, to highlight the importance of considering a person's mental health in the treatment of acne. A range of presenting issues are discussed, and cases of underserved patients needing additional considerations are highlighted. This article considers how the psychological sequelae can contribute to the pathogenesis of acne, and discusses how psychotherapeutic approaches can be of benefit to people experiencing appearance-related distress. Importantly, attention is paid to the need for clinicians to assess a patient's wellbeing alongside their physical symptoms. In doing this, early intervention can be facilitated if psychological comorbidities are present, with referral to appropriate specialist services, where available. To improve treatment outcomes, the skin and the mind must be addressed together in a multidisciplinary approach to dermatology care.

### Acne, depression, and suicide [^537da06d]. Dermatologic Clinics (2005). Low credibility.

Acne is a common disorder that may have a considerable psychologic impact including anxiety and depression. Depression and suicide occur frequently in adolescents and young adults. Although case reports suggest an association between isotretinoin and depression and suicide, more rigorous observational studies and epidemiologic studies, using different designs, have not shown any effect of isotretinoin use in increasing the occurrence of depression and suicide. It is prudent for the practitioner to continue to use isotretinoin to treat severe acne, while at the same time informing patients and their relatives that depressive symptoms should be actively assessed at each visit and, if necessary, referral to a psychiatrist and a discontinuation of isotretinoin should be considered.

### Psychodermatology of acne: dermatologist's guide to inner side of acne and management approach [^2f1151c3]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris (AV) is a skin disease that is commonly seen and causes scar formation especially when left untreated. It can cause serious psychological comorbidities due to the intense involvement of appeared areas such as face and also being common in adolescence in which the body perception is not yet well established. Although psychiatric comorbidities frequently accompany AV patients in dermatology, they almost never directed to dermatology-psychiatry liaison clinics. Depression, anxiety, stress, decreased self-esteem, suicidal thoughts and even suicide attempts are too frequent to ignore in these patients, and many studies have been conducted on the positive or controversial effects of acne treatments. For this reason, serious responsibilities fall to dermatologists. They should not treat AV lesions only, but also to determine the AV patients' psychological conditions and to direct them to get help when necessary.

### Targeting inflammation in acne: current treatments and future prospects [^d6e171b5]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Epidemiology

Acne vulgaris is one of the most encountered dermatologic conditions by dermatologists worldwide. Although the true prevalence is difficult to approximate, it is estimated to affect about 9% of the population. In the US alone, 5 million physician visits are attributed to acne annually, costing > 2 billion dollars. Cumulative prevalence approaches 100% in adolescence and decreases with age, affecting up to 64% of individuals aged 20–29 years and 43% of individuals aged 30–39 years, respectively. Age, oily skin, family history, and obesity are all risk factors for developing acne. While well-powered studies comparing acne in various racial and ethnic groups are lacking, acne is regarded as very common across global populations.

Clinical Presentation

Acne is classified morphologically, including comedonal, inflammatory, nodulocystic, and mixed phenotypes with varying severity. Acne can affect the face, chest, and back, or a combination of these areas. Scarring and pigmentary changes are frequent, with post-inflammatory dyspigmentation and keloidal scarring being more common in skin of color.

Quality of Life

Acne may profoundly impair quality of life by limiting self-esteem and self-confidence, placing individuals at a significantly increased risk for developing psychiatric conditions such as depression and anxiety. Acne is associated with increased risk of self-injury and suicide attempts, highlighting the concerning and significant connection between acne and mental health. The widespread presence of acne along with its effects on quality of life underscore the importance of having a broad spectrum of treatment options targeting its various pathogenetic factors.

### Signs of potential androgen excess across the lifespan in a US-based digital cohort study [^ed1fbe22]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Moderate to severe acne

Participants were given the options of no acne, small/raised pimples, red/irritated pimples, pimples that have pus, or scars from acne to describe acne on their face or back. We defined moderate to severe acne as reported "red, irritated pimples" and/or "pimples that have pus".

Secondary outcome measures of potential AE

Other survey questions relevant to clinical signs of potential AE were evaluated as secondary outcomes (survey questions in Supplemental Table S1): hair on the body relative to female family members (less, more, about the same); hair levels on the upper lip (none, a few, several, a lot); experience of hair loss (yes/no) from 5 locations of the head (temples or sides of the forehead, top of the head, hairline, random/small patches across the head, or across the whole head); hair loss relative to female peers (less hair loss, more hair loss, about the same); responses to the 4 different characteristics of acne (small/raised pimples, red/irritated pimples, pimples that have pus, or scars from acne, exploring yes/no responses separately for each characteristic); and acne compared to female peers (less, more, same).

### Genome-wide association meta-analysis identifies 29 new acne susceptibility loci [^91f08f62]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Acne vulgaris is a common skin disorder that results from inflammation of the pilosebaceous unit leading to the characteristic comedones, papules, pustules, nodules and cysts. Lesions are generally restricted to the face, neck, chest and back, and onset typically occurs during puberty. Prevalence estimates of acne vary substantially; it is estimated that more than 85% of teenagers are affected to some degree, and up to 8% have been reported with severe disease, making acne the most prevalent skin disease worldwide. According to the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD)acne was estimated to be responsible for nearly 5 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) globally in 2019, of which the majority occurred in those aged 15–49 years. This is greater than other chronic inflammatory conditions such as psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis. Severe acne often persists into adulthood, and scar formation is more prevalent in this severe adult population. Acne is associated with impaired quality of life, including lower rates of employment in patients with acne, and reduced school and work performance, as well as a substantial impact on mental health that correlates with clinical severity. Individuals with acne have elevated rates of depression and higher rates of mental health illness than those without acne, with rates of suicidal ideation and other mental health disorders being up to three times higher in adolescents with severe acne than their peers with little or no acne. Several studies report increased clinical depression, anxiety and hospitalisation rates due to mental health disorders in adults and adolescents with acne, with the magnitude of the effect larger in adults.

In terms of 'cures', veganism was frequently mentioned. Although veganism has many tangible benefits, such as reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, decreased environmental impact and ethical considerations, there is no supportive evidence for veganism in reducing acne severity. Despite this, several veganism support groups claim that veganism can rapidly clear acne. Other 'miracle cures' included branded topical treatments, usually lauded in testimonials as achieving clear skin within weeks, often following supposedly failed conventional treatments. These topical treatments were often marketed as being 'natural' or 'herbal' Other 'wonder' treatments for pimples included toothpaste, lemon juice and garlic. Related to diet, nutritional deficiencies were frequently mentioned as a cause of acne, with expensive supplements recommended to achieve clear skin. Ironically, some supplements can actually precipitate or aggravate acne, for example vitamin B6/B12, iodine and of course supplements adulterated with anabolic steroids. Examples of recommended supplements included zinc, magnesium and probiotics. Diindolylmethane (DIM), a compound found in cruciferous vegetables, was touted as a 'hormone balancer', which blocks androgen receptors and promotes 'production of good estrogen'. Although DIM has been studied as a chemoprotective and anti‐inflammatory agent in vitro, some reports that ascribed anticancer effects to it have been retracted due to data falsification, and there are no clinical studies assessing use of DIM in acne. A 'medical medium' also claimed to cure your acne if you bought his book for $16.99.

### Is there a place for biologics in acne? [^675d392a]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Acne Treatment: Why Consider Biologics?

Acne is among the most prevalent dermatological conditions, affecting over 85% of adolescents. While commonly associated with teenagers, it can occur across various age groups and often persists into adulthood. Acne significantly impacts emotional well-being, social interactions, relationships, daily routines, academic performance, and professional life. It is linked to higher risks of stigmatization, bullying, low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. Although numerous topical and systemic therapies are available, these treatments often fail to meet patient expectations for rapid improvement, sustained remission, lack of side effects, and prevention of recurrence and scarring.

Given the success of biological treatments in managing various inflammatory skin diseases, it is worth exploring whether these therapies could provide similar benefits for acne. Biologic therapies, with their targeted mechanisms of action, might present promising options by addressing chronicity, reducing antibiotic dependence, and preventing progression to severe disease (Table 1).

### Psychosocial sequelae related to acne: looking beyond the physical [^f0d1a254]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

The emotional impact of acne is influenced by numerous factors including age, psychosocial factors, severity of disease, social and familial networks and patient specific personalities. Adolescents are an emotionally vulnerable population, and acne can significantly burden their psychological resources. Looking beyond the physical manifestations of acne can add valuable clinical information aiding clinicians in choosing the most beneficial treatment regimens. Patients at high risk for psychological and/or physical harm can in need of psychiatric referral can also be better recognized.

2. Acne Vulgaris

Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory dermatological condition characterized by open and/or closed comedones and inflammatory papules, pustules or nodules. Factors leading to acne formation include the abnormal desquamation of follicular epithelial cells and an enhanced production of sebum. In addition, the proliferation of Propionibacterium acnes in the PSU can also be a causative factor.

In women with acne, not only is there frequent hypersensitivity of the sebaceous glands to androgens but there is also often a systemic excess of androgens. These factors lead to the abnormal cellular development and extra sebum in turn resulting in the comedones, papules, pustules and nodules that characterize acne. Women with conditions that cause androgen excess, such as polycystic ovary disease, regularly show symptoms of acne.

Acne is one of the most common skin disorders. Acne occurs commonly in adolescence; however, in a study examining the prevalence of acne in adults aged 20–49 years, acne was reported in 26.3–50.9% of women. The prevalence of acne decreases with age, with 50.9% of women aged 20–29 years reporting acne compared with 26.3% of women aged 40–49 years. Acne has many psychiatric and psychological implications and can adversely affect quality of life. Women with acne may experience clinical depression, anxiety and social anxiety, and often women are more embarrassed by their acne than men.

### Genome-wide association meta-analysis identifies 29 new acne susceptibility loci [^4c741beb]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

In addition to identifying specific loci contributing to acne susceptibility, our results demonstrate substantial polygenicity beyond the genome-wide significant association signals. In addition to the estimated 6% of the variance in acne liability explained by the 46 independent genome-wide significant variants identified here, a further 17% of acne liability is estimated to be explained by the polygenic tail. The polygenic architecture enabled the evaluation of genetic relationships with other traits that share underlying biological pathways, including immune-mediated disorders including Crohn's disease and evidence of shared genetic aetiology with other traits including a series of mental health disorders and breast cancer. The epidemiological association between acne and mental health has been well documented. However, the direction of causality remains unclear; several observational studies indicate that damaged self-esteem resulting from acne development may mediate the association between severe acne and internalising psychopathology, and depression, anxiety, and emotional lability have been associated with isotretinoin treatment. In contrast there is also evidence that stress, poor self-care and drug treatments for mental health disorders can cause acne. Elevated rates of breast cancer have been previously highlighted in females with a history of acneand the shared influence of genetics between acne and breast cancer highlights the potential importance of endogenous hormone regulation, which is a key component of breast cancer risk and is further supported by a putative causal relationship between testosterone levels and acne. We also identify shared genetic architecture between acne and chronic pain, specifically joint pain and headache. Notably, there appears to be asymmetry in the genetic correlation, consistent with loci contributing to acne susceptibility being causal for chronic pain.

### Multimodal treatment of acne, acne scars and pigmentation [^18f7fa1b]. Dermatologic Clinics (2009). Low credibility.

Acne is a common skin disease that affects nearly 80% of adolescents and young adults aged 11 to 30 years. Lesions appear primarily on the face, back, chest, and other areas with a high concentration of pilosebaceous glands. The development of inflammatory lesions often drives acne patients to seek treatment. If a lesion becomes severely inflamed it may leave a scar. Severe scarring caused by acne is associated with substantial physical and psychological distress, particularly in adolescents. This article reviews the causes of acne, the treatment options, and grading scales.

### The importance of mindfulness in psychosocial distress and quality of life in dermatology patients [^2c709043]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Dermatological conditions can result in disability levels equivalent to those of other chronic diseases, affecting self‐esteem, work and relationships. 1 It is estimated that for at least one‐third of dermatology patients effective management requires the management of psychosocial distress, 2 with 85% of patients indicating that such factors are an important aspect of living with a skin condition. 3 Higher rates of depression and anxiety have been reported by dermatological cohorts in comparison with the general population. 4, 5 For example, people with psoriasis have reported high levels of psychosocial disability and worrying about their appearance. 6 Similarly, high rates of anxiety have been found in people with psoriasis and atopic eczema. 7, 8 Patients with acne have been found to experience depression, 2 social anxiety 9 and increased thoughts of suicide. 10 Increased levels of anxiety, depression and phobic reactions have also been reported by people living with alopecia. 11 There is a risk that people living with a skin condition can experience distress during social situations, 12 which can result in avoidance of social encounters. 13

For people living with a visible skin condition there is a real risk of experiencing actual negative reactions from others. 14, 15 People have reported cases of discrimination such as being asked to leave public places. 16 Not surprisingly, high levels of self‐consciousness have been described by some people living with visible conditions, and self‐consciousness has been reported to be related to avoidant coping strategies. 15 For example, people living with alopecia often attempt to conceal hair loss, using a variety of methods. 17 Anxiety is known to be associated with specific forms of cognitive processing such as attentional and appraisal biases, whereby the individual is at risk of misinterpreting responses of others. 18

Patients with psoriasis have been found to demonstrate biases towards negative self‐referential words (e.g. embarrass, ugly), reactions of others (e.g. ridicule, whisper) and condition‐specific information (e.g. itching, messy) in comparison with controls. 19 Indeed, functional magnetic resonance imaging studies suggest that patients with psoriasis may block emotional processing when seeing faces showing disgust, as a coping strategy to protect them from stressful emotional responses. 20 Similarly, in acne a recent eye‐tracking study demonstrated that participants exhibited an attentional bias towards acne lesions in comparison with controls. 21

### Depression and anxiety in adults with hidradenitis suppurativa: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^06405c96]. JAMA Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Previous studies suggest that depression and anxiety are common in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), more so than other dermatological conditions. Yet, to the authors' knowledge, no previous systematic review or meta-analysis has estimated the prevalence or odds ratio (OR) for those psychiatric comorbidities in this population.

Objective

To assess the prevalence and odds for depression and anxiety in patients with HS.

Data Sources

From July 25 to September 30, 2018, observational studies investigating the prevalence and odds for depression and anxiety in adults with HS were systematically searched without language restriction from the inception of each database to July 25, 2018, in PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO databases. Searches used various configurations of the terms hidradenitis suppurativa; acne inversa; depressive disorder; depression; anxiety; anxiety disorders; phobia, social; suicide; and suicide, attempted. In addition, the reference lists of included references were screened manually.

Study Selection

Two investigators independently screened references that measured prevalence rates and odds for depressive and anxiety symptoms in patients with HS. Of 136 unique references, 10 ultimately met inclusion criteria.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Relevant data were extracted from eligible references. Authors were contacted to provide further information when necessary. Methodological quality of included studies was assessed through a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Random-effects models were used to synthesize available evidence.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Prevalence rates and ORs for depression and anxiety in adults with HS were the primary outcome measures. Heterogeneity across studies was assessed with the I² statistic. Sources of heterogeneity were explored through subgroup and meta-regression analyses.

Results

Ten studies comprising 40 307 participants with HS met inclusion criteria. The overall prevalence of depression was 16.9% (95% CI, 9.9%-27.2%). Heterogeneity was large. In the subgroup of studies that considered a clinical criteria-based diagnosis of depression, the prevalence of depression was 11.9% (95% CI, 4.9%-26.2%), compared with 26.8% (95% CI, 20.4%-34.5%) in studies that used a screening instrument. The methodological quality of included studies moderated those findings. The OR for depression in individuals with HS compared with individuals without HS was 1.84 (95% CI, 1.57–2.15). The prevalence of anxiety was 4.9% (95% CI, 1.7%-13.2%); there were insufficient data to determine an odds ratio for anxiety in persons with HS because 2 studies included a comparison group.

Conclusions and Relevance

This systematic review and meta-analysis indicates that depression and anxiety are common comorbid conditions in patients with HS. Results suggest that the development of strategies to recognize and treat those psychiatric comorbidities in patients with HS is warranted.

### Adapalene and benzoyl peroxide (Epiduo) [^f1b1e0dd]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

What is EPIDUO gel?

EPIDUO gel is a prescription medicine for skin use only (topical) used to treat acne vulgaris in people 9 years of age and older.

Acne vulgaris is a condition in which the skin has blackheads, whiteheads and pimples.

It is not known if EPIDUO gel is safe and effective in children younger than 9 years old.

What should I tell my doctor before using EPIDUO gel?

Before you use EPIDUO gel, tell your doctor if you:

have other skin problems, including cuts or sunburn
have any other medical conditions
are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. It is not known if EPIDUO gel can harm your unborn baby. Talk to your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.
are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if EPIDUO gel passes into your breast milk and if it can harm your baby. Talk to your doctor about the best way to feed your baby if you use EPIDUO gel.

Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take, including prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins and herbal supplements.

Especially tell your doctor if you use any other medicine for acne. Using EPIDUO gel with topical medicines that contain sulfur, resorcinol or salicylic acid may cause skin irritation.

### The psychological burden of skin diseases: a cross-sectional multicenter study among dermatological out-patients in 13 European countries [^694c2960]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

The highest rate of anxiety was reported in patients with psoriasis and hand eczema. The prevalence of depression among psoriasis patients and the significant OR of 3.02 are in accordance with a recent meta-analysis of 98 studies, showing that > 10% of psoriasis patients have clinical depression. Our finding of anxiety in 17% of patients is higher compared with the findings of a global longitudinal study on psoriasis showing anxiety in 11% of patients but in accordance with a recent study of psoriasis patients from Canada using the HADS. The rates of anxiety we found in patients with hand eczema were in agreement with a German study among 122 patients, also using the HADS, showing a 20% prevalence of anxiety.

By separating anxiety and depression some additional relevant observations have been made possible. Patients with acne have significantly more anxiety compared with the controls, but are not depressed, and patients have an OR > 2 for clinical anxiety. Although a previous study showed a significant increased association between acne and mental distress, our findings are relevant. Suicidal thoughts were only significantly associated with psoriasis. This is in accordance with the study ofamong patients with psoriasis but in contrast to a recent study examining suicidal ideation in 907 men with physical illnesses, which did not find significant association with psoriasis in a model controlling for depression. In our study, the increased rates of suicidal ideation for other skin conditions were not significant, suggesting that in our sample suicidal thoughts are secondary to other factors such as depression. It is possible that the "yes" or "no" response choice might have resulted in a higher recording of suicidal ideation. Nevertheless, the original aspect in this present study is that patients were specifically asked about suicidal ideation caused by skin symptoms.

### Optimal management of acne to prevent scarring and psychological sequelae [^982e8606]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is one of the most common inflammatory dermatoses and is seen in both the hospital setting and in general practice. Multiple factors are involved in the pathophysiology of acne, including: an alteration in the pattern of keratinization within the pilosebaceous follicles resulting in comedone formation; an increase in sebum production which is influenced by androgens; the proliferation of Propionibacterium acnes; and the production of perifollicular inflammation. Genetic and hormonal factors may also contribute to acne. Better understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease has led to the development of novel therapies which are directed at one or more of the implicated etiologic factors. Systemic antibiotics for acne have been the mainstay of treatment for many years. The main cause for concern following the use of systemic antibiotics is the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of P. acnes. Concomitant use of non-antibiotic therapies such as benzoyl peroxide helps to decrease the occurrence of resistance and can be effective in the treatment of resistant and nonresistant propionibacterial strains. However, no one agent is able to eradicate resistant strains completely and as resistant strains correlate to poor clinical response to therapy, prescribing strategies are required to minimize the occurrence of resistance to P. acnes. When assessing acne it is important to take an all embracing approach and to examine carefully for both the clinical and psychologic effects of the disease process. There are numerous forms of acne scarring and it is important to be aware of these as patients who are developing scarring merit early effective therapy. Some patients with acne will develop psychologic problems as a consequence of their condition. Even mild to moderate disease can be associated with significant depression and suicidal ideation and psychologic change does not necessarily correlate with disease severity. Acne scars themselves have been shown to produce significant psychopathology. When initiating treatment it is important to consider the aims of therapy. Treatment should be aimed at achieving clearance of acne, prevention of scarring and, where necessary, relief from any psychologic stress resulting from the acne. Therapy should be commenced early in the disease process in order to prevent scarring and it is important to select appropriate therapies according to the clinical signs and psychologic disability. It is also important to ensure that the patient is able to comply with therapy and clear guidelines regarding treatment, possible adverse effects and realistic expectations should be provided.

### Management of acne vulgaris with hormonal therapies in adult female patients [^c7e5f60a]. Dermatologic Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a very common condition affecting up of 93% of adolescents. Although rare, this disease may persist in adulthood. In adult women with acne (those older than 25 years old), this condition is particularly relevant because of the refractory to conventional therapies, which makes acne a challenge for dermatologists in this group of patients. In order to its potential risk for chronicity and the involvement of visible anatomical sites such as face and upper torso, acne has been associated with a wide spectrum of psychological and social dysfunction such as depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, somatization, and social inhibition. In particular, adult women with acne have been shown to be adversely impacted by the effect of acne on their quality of life. For the last four decades, dermatologists have used hormonal therapies for the management of acne vulgaris in adult women, which are considered a rational choice given the severity and chronicity of this condition in this group of patients. The aim of this work is to review the hormonal drugs for management of acne.

### Consensus recommendations for the use of retinoids in ichthyosis and other disorders of cornification in children and adolescents [^9df47448]. Pediatric Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

8 PSYCHIATRIC EFFECTS OF SYSTEMIC RETINOID THERAPY

The relationship between use of systemic retinoids and development of psychiatric symptoms is controversial. Often the systemic retinoid is used for a chronic disorder, which in itself can contribute to psychiatric symptoms. Additionally, the incidence of major depressive disorder in adolescents in the United States is quite high. In 2017, 13.3% of adolescents 12‐17 years old experienced major depressive disorder, with females affected more frequently than males (20% vs 6.6%). 114 The psychiatric effects of retinoid use in children and adolescents with ichthyosis, specifically, have not been examined.

Most studies exploring these relationships evaluate patients with acne. One large retrospective review of over 21,000 patients aged 10‐29 years found no increased relative risk of psychiatric symptoms for those taking antibiotics vs. systemic retinoids to treat acne. 115 A questionnaire of 3,775 teens with acne suggested the increase of mental health issues in candidates for systemic isotretinoin was, in part, due to the acne itself. 116 Multiple case reports have detailed worsening psychiatric symptoms in patients taking systemic retinoids, particularly isotretinoin. A systematic review of these reports found an average onset of psychiatric symptoms at 5.4 weeks into the course, but factors predisposing patients were unclear. 117 In a case‐crossover study exploring the timing of hospitalization for depression and use of systemic isotretinoin, authors reported an adjusted relative risk of 2.68 to develop depression when exposed to isotretinoin and a threefold increased risk for patients with a history of depression. 118 A review of the French National Pharmacovigilance Database for reports of adverse events to any systemic retinoid treating any disorder also suggested an increased risk of development of psychiatric symptoms in patients with a personal or family history of psychiatric disease. 119

These reports support monitoring patients for the development of psychiatric symptoms while taking systemic retinoids and co‐management with a mental health provider in patients with psychiatric symptoms. That said, ichthyosis itself can have a profound impact on a patient's quality of life. 120 In a cross‐sectional study of children and adults with ichthyosis, 30.2% of children screened positive for depression and 37.7% for anxiety. 121 In adults, 34.4% screened positive for depression and 27.3% were positive for anxiety. A mental health inquiry should be performed on every patient with a DOC at baseline and follow‐up regardless of therapy. Consensus recommendations are listed in Table 11.

### Global prevalence of mental health comorbidity in patients with acne: an analysis of trends from 1961 to 2023 [^7ee9b8e8]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with acne increasingly face mental health challenges such as anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts. However, no global systematic analysis exists on this topic.

Objectives

To examine the prevalence of mental disorders - specifically, anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts - among patients with acne.

Methods

An exhaustive search of six databases was conducted up to May 2023. Data analysis was performed using Python and Stata MP 17, including subgroup evaluations, metaregression and sensitivity analyses.

Results

Forty-three studies were analysed. The findings indicate that depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts in patients with acne are prevalent at rates of 22%, 29% and 12%, respectively. Rates of depression were highest in Asia at 42%, led by India (53%) and Saudi Arabia (51%). Anxiety was also most common in Asia, at 45%, notably in Singapore (60%) and Iran (58%). Suicidal thoughts were highest in Oceania, specifically New Zealand at 24%. The study is limited by the inclusion of only Chinese- and English-language research, potentially introducing selection bias.

Conclusions

The results of this study highlight the incidence of mental health disorders coexisting with acne. This study may help to foster greater understanding and awareness among both medical professionals and patients regarding the psychological complexities tied to acne.

### Consequences of psychological distress in adolescents with acne [^9ebbca77]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Acne may cause psychological distress that is associated with many psychiatric disorders. In this issue, Halvorsen et al. report suicidal ideation, mental health problems, and affective isolation to be relatively frequent in adolescents with acne. This report suggests that adverse events that have been attributed to therapies for acne, including suicidal ideation and depression, may reflect the burden of substantial acne rather than the effect of medications.

### Projective personification approach to the experience of people with acne and acne scarring-expressing the unspoken [^99d0ab25]. JAMA Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Acne is a common condition afflicting many adolescents that may even persist during adulthood. Acne has the potential to adversely affect health-related quality of life (HRQoL).,

Acne scarring is a long-term complication experienced to some extent by most who have had acne and can persist for a lifetime. Many studies have attempted to describe the psychosocial effects of acne, but only a few have explored the negative effects of acne scarring. Acne scarring, although poorly researched, has been associated with psychosocial morbidity and impaired HRQoL. Evidence suggests that acne scarring can negatively influence the self-esteem and self-confidence of individuals, leading to anxiety, depression, and perceived decreased employability, which in turn can affect their social and vocational functioning. Furthermore, acne scarringis associated with stigmatization, which can affect their emotional well-being and social life.

Most studies exploring the effects of acne on psychosocial well-being have focused on facial acne using dermatology-specific questionnaires. In-depth data on the association of both facial and truncal active acne (FTA) and its sequelae, acne scars (AS), with the psychosocial well-being are increasing but still limited. A qualitative, in-depth exploration of burden, defined as something oppressive or worrisome, of active FTA and AS with a projective technique is an innovative perspective to provide an insight into HRQoL of afflicted individuals. The present study aimed to demonstrate the association of FTA and AS with people's lives and their similarities despite the time elapsed since active acne for participants with AS.

Psychiatric symptoms and monitoring — Changes in mood, including depression, suicidal ideation, and suicide have been reported sporadically in patients taking isotretinoin, but to date no studies suggest an evidence-based link; multiple studies show no population-level depression signal and most studies report improvement or no negative effects on mood or cognition, so the prescribing physician should continue to monitor for these symptoms and make therapeutic decisions individually.

### The psychological burden of skin diseases: a cross-sectional multicenter study among dermatological out-patients in 13 European countries [^06faa1eb]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Table 4 gives data on anxiety in patients with common skin diseases. Overall, anxiety affected 17.2% of the patients compared with 11.1% of the controls (P < 0.001, adjusted OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.68–2.82). The highest adjusted OR for anxiety disorders were found among patients with psoriasis (OR 2.91, 95% CI 2.01–4.21), leg ulcers (OR 2.80, 95% CI 1.18–6.64), hand eczema (OR 2.60, 95% CI 1.45–4.67), and acne (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.40–4.58).

Suicidal ideation in common skin conditions is described in Table 5. Overall 12.7% of the dermatological patients reported suicidal ideation compared with 8.3% of the controls (P < 0.001, adjusted OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.95–1.62). Only patients with psoriasis had a significant association with suicidal thoughts (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.33–2.82). Of the patients reporting overall suicidal ideation, 53.6% reported that the suicidal thoughts were because of their skin condition: specifically 67.6% of patients with psoriasis and 68.0% of patients with atopic dermatitis reported suicidal ideation because of their skin.

### Impact of facial atrophic acne scars on quality of life: a multi-country population-based survey [^d5b9e4b7]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acne, a common chronic inflammatory skin condition, affects more than 80% of adolescents and young adults and ranks among the top 10 most prevalent diseases worldwide. Scarring can be a major concern for patients with acne, as scars can persist, and are often experienced by the majority of acne-afflicted individuals.

Despite the scarcity of data, acne scarring is thought to be associated with adverse psychosocial disability resulting from embarrassment, self-consciousness, and poor self-esteem. People who develop acne scars often exhibit symptoms of frustration, depression, anxiety, and stress, and fear that their appearance may interfere with their academic performance, professional relationships, and chances of future employment. A few attempts have been directed to explore the specific psychological effects of acne scar, a condition separate from acne. Most published reports concerning the impact of acne scars on patient wellbeing are limited to the use of tools that lack the sensitivity and specificity to assess the impact of scars. In addition, these studies report scars according to clinical judgment despite the discrepancy between patient perception of scar severity and dermatologist assessment. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs), including symptom severity and impact on health-related quality of life (HRQOL), are key components of effective, patient-centered services aimed at capturing and meaningfully incorporating patient experiences, perspectives, needs, and priorities into clinical practice and drug development.

In this population-based survey of adults with facial acne scarring but with no evidence of active acne, we aimed to determine the impact of facial acne scars on HRQOL from the patients' perspective, using recently developed patient self-completion instruments that specifically address acne scarring evaluation.

### Association of suicide attempts with acne and treatment with isotretinoin: retrospective Swedish cohort study [^7c7f0d68]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Isotretinoin (13- cis -retinoic acid) has been used since the 1980s to treat severe recalcitrant nodular acne with good effect, but case reports and spontaneous reporting of adverse drug reactions have suggested an association between isotretinoin, depression, and suicidal behaviour. Observational studies have had conflicting results, however. Because a causal relation between isotretinoin and psychiatric reactions was difficult to exclude, labelling changes strengthening warnings about psychiatric adverse reactions have been added in product information for isotretinoin products within the EU despite contradictory evidence.

The association between acne, psychiatric morbidity, and suicide attempts has been described, and some authors have observed that isotretinoin actually leads to an improvement in anxiety and depression because of the clearing of disfiguring acne. Acne in itself is not considered to be a serious condition. If its treatment is suspected to entail severe side effects, the harm-benefit balance of that treatment must be thoroughly investigated. New data suggesting plausible biological mechanisms elucidating the association between retinoid regulation and mood through monoaminergic systems have been emerging.

Our underlying hypothesis was that people with severe acne may be at a higher risk of attempted suicide regardless of exposure to isotretinoin. The aim of this study was to assess the risk of suicide attempts before, during, and after treatment with isotretinoin for severe acne.

### Management of acne vulgaris: a review [^2f739262]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acne vulgaris:

- **Definition**: Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that predominantly affects late adolescents and young adults.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of acne vulgaris is multifaceted, which includes disturbed sebaceous gland activity leading to hyperseborrhea or increased sebum production, dysregulation of the hormone microenvironment, interaction with neuropeptides, follicular hyperkeratinization, induction of inflammation, and dysfunction of the innate and adaptive immunity.
- **Epidemiology**: The worldwide prevalence of acne vulgaris is estimated at 1,585 per 100,000 population.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for acne vulgaris include hormonal influences, particularly androgens that enhance sebum production, most notably in polycystic ovarian syndrome, genetic predisposition with identified susceptibility loci, the use of specific medications, obesity, family history, and environmental factors. The precise etiological triggers of acne, however, remain unclear.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, acne vulgaris presents with a variety of lesions, including open and closed comedones (blackheads and whiteheads), inflammatory papules, pustules, and nodules and cysts in severe cases. It typically resolves in the late teens or early adulthood, but for some patients, it can persist into later life. Scarring, a potential consequence, can reduce the QoL of patients.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Acne vulgaris is not a life-threatening condition. However, it can have significant physical and psychological effects.

### The reconstructive challenges and approach to patients with excoriation disorder [^ab0c8464]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Many mental and emotional disorders have some variations of physical manifestations that are often the first definitive sign of disease. One such disorder is excoriation (skin-picking) disorder, also known as dermatillomania, acne excoriée, neurotic excoriation, or psychogenic excoriation. First identified in the dermatologic literature in 1920, excoriation disorder involves repetitive scratching behavior that sometimes accompanies pruritus and is often associated with depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. In the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fifth edition, excoriation or skin-picking disorder is listed as a stand-alone disorder associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder. In certain patients, the skin lesions are shallow and have adherent crusts that can be mistaken for acne. These lesions, once healed, may appear white and partially atrophic. Because these patients often initially present to dermatologists or plastic surgeons for their skin conditions rather than to psychiatric professionals, it is important to recognize the salient diagnostic features and to acknowledge the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to patient care and management. We present a case of a 51-year-old woman with excoriation disorder who required medical management by dermatology, neurosurgery, psychiatry, and plastic surgery for a definitive surgical treatment.

### Tretinoin — tretinoin — microsphere [^c75ebe70]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Tell your doctor about all of the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, herbal supplements, and any skin products that you use.

Especially tell your doctor if you use any other medicines to treat your acne, including medicated cleansers or soaps. Using other topical acne products may increase the irritation of your skin when used with tretinoin gel (microsphere).

Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them to show your doctor and pharmacist when you get a new medicine.

How should I use tretinoin gel (microsphere)?

Use tretinoin gel (microsphere) exactly as your doctor tells you to use it.
Your doctor may change your dose of tretinoin gel (microsphere) if you have skin irritation.
Before you apply tretinoin gel (microsphere), gently wash the affected skin area with a mild, non-medicated soap. Rinse and pat your skin dry.
Apply tretinoin gel (microsphere) 1 time a day in the evening, or as prescribed by your doctor.
Do not use more tretinoin gel (microsphere) than you need to cover the affected area and do not apply tretinoin gel (microsphere) more than 1 time a day. Using too much tretinoin gel (microsphere) or using it too often will not give you faster or better results, and you may get skin redness, peeling, or discomfort.
You may have a brief feeling of warmth or slight stinging after applying tretinoin gel (microsphere).
You may use moisturizers and cosmetics.
Early in your treatment, you may get new pimples. At this stage, it is important to continue using tretinoin gel (microsphere).
Your acne may not get better right away. Use tretinoin gel (microsphere) even after your acne improves. Your acne may get better after two weeks of treatment, but more than seven weeks of tretinoin gel (microsphere) treatment are needed before you get the full benefit.

### Comorbidity screening in hidradenitis suppurativa: evidence-based recommendations from the US and Canadian Hidradenitis Suppurativa Foundations [^58eb9a2b]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background:

Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is associated with comorbidities that contribute to poor health, impaired life quality, and mortality risk.

Objective:

To provide evidence-based screening recommendations for comorbidities linked to HS.

Methods:

Systematic reviews were performed to summarize evidence on the prevalence and incidence of 30 comorbidities in patients with HS relative to the general population. The screening recommendation for each comorbidity was informed by the consistency and quality of existing studies, disease prevalence, and magnitude of association, as well as benefits, harms, and feasibility of screening. The level of evidence and strength of corresponding screening recommendation were graded by using the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy (SORT) criteria.

Results:

Screening is recommended for the following comorbidities: acne, dissecting cellulitis of the scalp, pilonidal disease, pyoderma gangrenosum, depression, generalized anxiety disorder, suicide, smoking, substance use disorder, polycystic ovary syndrome, obesity, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory bowel disease, spondyloarthritis, and sexual dysfunction. It is also recommended to screen patients with Down syndrome for HS. The decision to screen for specific comorbidities may vary with patient risk factors. The role of the dermatologist in screening varies according to comorbidity.

Limitations:

Screening recommendations represent one component of a comprehensive care strategy.

Conclusions:

Dermatologists should support screening efforts to identify comorbid conditions in HS.

### Psychological impact of acne on 21st-century adolescents: decoding for better care [^043f6cda]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

The psychological consequences of acne have been the subject of many studies. As a particularly visible skin disorder, acne complicates the daily lives of adolescents who are undergoing multiple transformations: physical, intellectual and emotional. While it is well established that acne can be responsible for depression and low self-esteem, it is likely that this impact is aggravated by the sociological evolution of adolescents in the 21st century. Understanding the codes of adolescents today (who can be characterized as being more concerned by their appearance than previous generations at the same age) allows us to optimize our medical approach to acne and facilitates treatment compliance and adherence.

### Isotretinoin and adverse neuropsychiatric outcomes: retrospective cohort study using routine data [^c9722455]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite concerns over isotretinoin‐induced idiosyncratic adverse effects, research aiming to identify potentially vulnerable patients is lacking. Being exposed to large amounts of vitamin A is known to have neurotoxic effects, but the ability of the therapeutic doses of isotretinoin typically used in treating acne to induce severe acute psychiatric symptoms has not been established. This could be partly because the focus has been on the direct effects of isotretinoin on psychiatric outcomes, such as on isotretinoin‐induced primary depression. Interaction between acne‐related symptoms and the relatively common physical and neurological side‐effects of isotretinoin has rarely been examined as a potential mechanism for idiosyncratic neuropsychiatric adverse outcomes associated with isotretinoin. For example, a bidirectional association between headache and depression has been established, and co‐occurring headache and depression has also been reported among patients treated with isotretinoin.

We observed that patients treated with isotretinoin significantly more often experienced incident physical symptoms than patients with acne receiving other types of treatment or no treatment with acne prescription medicines. An increased graded association by the severity of acne was observed for these physical symptoms. Acne‐related psychosocial stress in general or pre‐existing subclinical mental health problems together with an initial acne flare‐up or other isotretinoin‐induced physical side‐effects may trigger clinically relevant mental health symptoms in patients already vulnerable because of their severe acne, particularly among patients with limited coping and emotional resilience. Research on stressful life events has shown that even relatively minor and low‐intensity life events and experiences can trigger clinically relevant symptoms of anxiety and depression in vulnerable individuals. Similar mechanisms of underlying sustained and accumulated acne‐related psychological burden may contribute to an increased vulnerability of clinically relevant mental health problems among patients who experience added psychological burden because of acute isotretinoin‐induced physical or neurological side‐effects. Therefore, it can be suggested that psychosocial vulnerability in general, pre‐existing subclinical mental health problems, physical comorbidity, subjective and objective burden of acne symptoms, age at onset and duration of acne symptoms, and the frequency and intensity of isotretinoin‐induced physical and neurological side‐effects, all contribute to the risk of adverse mental health outcomes during isotretinoin treatment. In practice, therefore, the physical side‐effects of the medication should also be considered during isotretinoin treatment; and if appropriate, the dose reduced, particularly in patients with mental health symptoms. Future observational research should aim to establish the potential role of common physical and neurological side‐effects as mediators for adverse mental health outcomes during isotretinoin treatment.

### Social anxiety and quality of life in vitiligo and acne patients with facial involvement: a cross-sectional controlled study [^7a4e1db9]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Vitiligo and acne vulgaris, commonly affecting the face, have significant psychological effects and impair the quality of life of the affected individuals. Because of their negative effect on physical appearance, these conditions may act as a potential barrier to social relationships and cause social anxiety.

Objective

The objective of the study was to investigate the social anxiety, quality of life, anxiety, and depression levels of acne and vitiligo patients with facial involvement and compare these levels with healthy controls.

Methods

Thirty-seven vitiligo and 37 acne patients, aged older than 18 years, with facial involvement and 74 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects were included in the study. The patients and healthy controls were asked to complete the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Dermatology Life Quality Index. Disease severity was evaluated both objectively by the physician and subjectively by the patients using a visual analog scale.

Results

Social anxiety, depression, and anxiety levels of vitiligo and acne patients were significantly higher than healthy controls (p < 0.05). Quality of life was impaired in both patient groups (Dermatology Life Quality Index scores for vitiligo: 5.6 ± 5.1; acne: 6.4 ± 6.2). There was no correlation between psychiatric scale scores and disease severity. Quality of life was negatively correlated with social anxiety and depression levels in both patient groups in our study.

Conclusion

Vitiligo and acne patients had higher levels of social anxiety, anxiety, and depression compared with healthy control subjects. Considering that increased psychosocial morbidity was regardless of age, sex, and disease severity and was correlated with quality of life impairment, evaluation of the psychosocial morbidity, in particular social anxiety, may be valuable in all vitiligo and acne patients.

### Psychocutaneous disorders [^3c6cef1b]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2001). Low credibility.

Dermatologic conditions are commonly associated with psychiatric sequella, eg, urticaria, alopecia, psoriasis, or acne. Moreover, the onset and course of dermatologic disorders may be significantly influenced by stress, emotional disturbances, or psychiatric disorder. Compulsions involving the skin, excoriations, or hair pulling (trichotillomania) are the more frequently encountered problems. In some cases, skin conditions are self-induced or reflect signs or symptoms of an underlying psychiatric disorder, including psychosis or obsessive-compulsive disorder. Additionally, skin lesions have been frequently described in case reports of factitious dermatitis. Finally, adverse effects of psychotropic drugs may cause dermatologic side effects, mostly idiosyncratic skin eruptions. These problems are discussed with emphasis on clinical features, comorbidity, and psychiatric management.

MEDICATION GUIDE

AMNESTEEM (AM-NES-TEAM)

 (Isotretinoin Capsules, USP)

Read the Medication Guide that comes with Amnesteem before you start taking it and each time you get a prescription. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking with your doctor about your medical condition or your treatment.

What is the most important information I should know about Amnesteem?

Amnesteem®is used to treat a type of severe acne (nodular acne) that has not been helped by other treatments, including antibiotics.
Because Amnesteem can cause birth defects, Amnesteem is only for patients who can understand and agree to carry out all of the instructions in the iPLEDGE REMS.
Amnesteem may cause serious mental health problems.

Birth defects (deformed babies), loss of a baby before birth (miscarriage), death of the baby, and early (premature) births. Patients who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant must not take Amnesteem. Patients must not get pregnant:
for one month before starting Amnesteem
while taking Amnesteem
for one month after stopping Amnesteem.
If you get pregnant while taking Amnesteem, stop taking it right away and call your doctor. Doctors and patients should report all cases of pregnancy to:
FDA MedWatch at 1-800-FDA-1088, and

### New insights into systemic drivers of inflammation and their contributions to the pathophysiology of acne [^ac2c01fd]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Acne Vulgaris (AV) is a prominent skin disease commonly affecting teenagers. It often persists into adulthood and is associated with adverse physical and psychosocial impacts. The pathophysiology of AV is conventionally correlated with 4 factors within and around the pilosebaceous unit: increased sebum production, follicular hyperkeratinization, Cutibacterium acnes proliferation, and localized immune responses. As such, conventional therapeutic approaches for AV have primarily focused on these factors. In addition to this primarily localized pathophysiology, there is a progressively emerging body of evidence indicating that underlying systemic factors contributing to a generalized immuno-inflammatory response can contribute to or exacerbate AV. In this article, we introduce and provide the supporting data, for 6 patient-centric systems that may be implicated in the development of AV: psycho-emotional stress, diet and metabolism, dysbiosis of the gut and skin microbiome, hormonal fluctuations, oxidative stress, and immune response. Identifying these pathways and their contributions in a patient-centric approach may provide expanded therapeutic opportunities for treating patients with AV.

### The response of skin disease to stress… [^7be42a9a]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

A recent study5 conducted on 215 graduating medical students showed that 67% of students believed that stress plays a role in acne exacerbations. Moreover, 74% of patients with acne and their relatives also believed anxiety was an exacerbating factor in their disease. 6 These findings suggest that the perception of stress playing an exacerbating role in acne is not only widespread among patients but may be common in the practicing medical community as well. Clearly, there are some psychological components to the etiology of acne, because treatments such as biofeedback relaxation and cognitive imagery have been shown to be effective. 18 More specifically, patients with acne often complain of breakouts following the experience of frustrating or stressful events, 19, 20 and it has been observed that postadolescent patients with acne tend to be intense and ambitious people with high-visibility jobs.

21 Another study22 linking acne exacerbation with emotional factors reported an increase in acne lesion counts days following an interview during which anger was intentionally provoked. However, other reports of stress exacerbating acne, as previously outlined, have mainly been anecdotal. Despite widespread patient and physician perception, little research has been undertaken to demonstrate this association in a convincing manner. This study uses established and validated scales of acne severity and perceived stress and the widely accepted model of examination stress to explore the possible interactions between psychological stressors and acne vulgaris. As in any study, finding a correlation between 2 variables does not necessarily mean a direct cause-and-effect relationship. It is certainly plausible that the correlation observed is in part due to worsened acne itself causing increased stress, instead of the reverse relationship.

However, in a high-achieving population such as university students, subjects tended to report becoming less concerned with their appearance during examinations. Thus, it is more likely that increasing stress exacerbates acne instead of the reverse relationship. Various mechanisms have been proposed for why stress may potentially aggravate acne vulgaris. Some investigators31, 32 believe that increased glucocorticoids and adrenal androgens, both hormones known to worsen acne and possibly induce sebaceous hyperplasia, are released during periods of emotional stress. And corticotropin-releasing hormone, the body's coordinator in the stress response, was found to increase sebaceous lipogenesis and up-regulate sebocyte conversion of androgen precursors to testosterone. 33 There is also research34, 35 suggesting that stress-induced release of neuroactive substances within the epidermis can activate inflammatory processes in the skin.

### What's new in acne and inflammation? [^e601ae5e]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Acne is a disease that leaves physiological as well as physical scars. As we attempt to understand this complicated disease, new research challenges our traditional understanding that the microcomedone is the initial step in the development of the acne lesion. Recent evidence suggests that subclinical inflammation is the primary event in lesion development and that inflammation persists throughout the lesion life-cycle. Therefore, all types of acne should be considered "inflammatory" acne.

### Acne vulgaris: pathogenesis, treatment, and needs assessment [^8ad1f865]. Dermatologic Clinics (2012). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a common skin condition with substantial cutaneous and psychologic disease burden. Studies suggest that the emotional impact of acne is comparable to that experienced by patients with systemic diseases, like diabetes and epilepsy. In conjunction with the considerable personal burden experienced by patients with acne, acne vulgaris also accounts for substantial societal and health care burden. The pathogenesis and existing treatment strategies for acne are complex. This article discusses the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and treatment of acne vulgaris. The burden of disease in the United States and future directions in the management of acne are also addressed.

### Topical, light-based, and complementary interventions for acne: an overview of systematic reviews [^b4358aaa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Acne is a chronic inflammatory and immune-mediated disease of the pilosebaceous unit (the skin structure consisting of a hair follicle and its associated sebaceous gland). It is characterised by non-inflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones) and inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts). Lesions may be present on the face, thorax, and back, with variable severity. Acne exhibits a global distribution and has a growing prevalence. Acne vulgaris is the most common form. Acne gives rise to complications such as scars and can seriously affect people's mental health, especially those with severe acne. Acne has a huge impact on the quality of life and self-esteem of those affected.

Objectives

To synthesise the existing evidence on the efficacy and safety of non-systemic pharmacological interventions and non-pharmacological interventions (physical therapy and complementary therapies) in the treatment of acne vulgaris and related skin complications.

Methods

We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Epistemonikos, MEDLINE, and Embase to 2 December 2021, and checked the reference lists of included reviews. At least two authors were responsible for screening, data extraction, and critical appraisal. We excluded reviews with high risk of bias as assessed with the ROBIS tool. We evaluated the overall certainty of the evidence according to GRADE (as carried out by the authors of the included reviews or ourselves). We provide comprehensive evidence from the review data, including summary of findings tables, summary of results tables, and evidence maps.

Main Results

We retrieved and assessed a total of 733 records; however, only six reviews (five Cochrane reviews and one non-Cochrane review) with low risk of bias met the overview inclusion criteria. The six reviews involved 40,910 people with acne from 275 trials and 1316 people with acne scars from 37 trials. The age of the participants ranged from 10 to 59 years, with an average age range from 18 to 30 years. Four reviews included original trials involving only female participants and three reviews included original trials with only male participants. Main results for clinically important comparisons: Benzoyl peroxide versus placebo or no treatment: In two trials involving 1012 participants over 12 weeks, benzoyl peroxide may reduce the total (mean difference (MD) -16.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) -26.51 to -5.78), inflammatory (MD -6.12, 95% CI -11.02 to -1.22), and non-inflammatory lesion counts (MD -9.69, 95% CI -15.08 to -4.29) when compared to placebo (long-term treatment), but the evidence is very uncertain (very low-certainty evidence). Two trials including 1073 participants (time point: 10 and 12 weeks) suggested benzoyl peroxide may have little to no effect in improving participants' global self-assessment compared to placebo (long-term treatment), but the evidence is very uncertain (risk ratio (RR) 1.44, 95% CI 0.94 to 2.22; very low-certainty evidence). Very low-certainty evidence suggested that benzoyl peroxide may improve investigators' global assessment (RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.28; 6 trials, 4110 participants, long-term treatment (12 weeks)) compared to placebo. Thirteen trials including 4287 participants over 10 to 12 weeks suggested benzoyl peroxide may increase the risk of a less serious adverse event compared to placebo (long-term treatment), but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.11; very low-certainty evidence). Benzoyl peroxide versus topical retinoids: Benzoyl peroxide may increase the percentage change in total lesion count compared to adapalene (long-term treatment), but the evidence is very uncertain (MD 10.8, 95% CI 3.38 to 18.22; 1 trial, 205 participants, 12 weeks; very low-certainty evidence). When compared to adapalene, benzoyl peroxide may have little to no effect on the following outcomes (long-term treatment): percentage change in inflammatory lesion counts (MD -7.7, 95% CI -16.46 to 1.06; 1 trial, 142 participants, 11 weeks; very low-certainty evidence), percentage change in non-inflammatory lesion counts (MD -3.9, 95% CI -13.31 to 5.51; 1 trial, 142 participants, 11 weeks; very low-certainty evidence), participant's global self-assessment (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.06; 4 trials, 1123 participants, 11 to 12 weeks; low-certainty evidence), investigators' global assessment (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.37; 3 trials, 1965 participants, 12 weeks; low-certainty evidence), and incidence of a less serious adverse event (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.25, 1573 participants, 5 trials, 11 to 12 weeks; very low-certainty evidence). Benzoyl peroxide versus topical antibiotics: When compared to clindamycin, benzoyl peroxide may have little to no effect on the following outcomes (long-term treatment): total lesion counts (MD -3.50, 95% CI -7.54 to 0.54; 1 trial, 641 participants, 12 weeks; very low-certainty evidence), inflammatory lesion counts (MD -1.20, 95% CI -2.99 to 0.59; 1 trial, 641 participants, 12 weeks; very low-certainty evidence), non-inflammatory lesion counts (MD -2.4, 95% CI -5.3 to 0.5; 1 trial, 641 participants, 12 weeks; very low-certainty evidence), participant's global self-assessment (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.34; 1 trial, 240 participants, 10 weeks; low-certainty evidence), investigator's global assessment (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.45; 2 trials, 2277 participants, 12 weeks; very low-certainty evidence), and incidence of a less serious adverse event (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.64; 5 trials, 2842 participants, 10 to 12 weeks; low-certainty evidence). For these clinically important comparisons, no review collected data for the following outcomes: frequency of participants experiencing at least one serious adverse event or quality of life. No review collected data for the following comparisons: topical antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment, topical retinoids versus placebo or no treatment, or topical retinoids versus topical antibiotics.

Authors' Conclusions

This overview summarises the evidence for topical therapy, phototherapy, and complementary therapy for acne and acne scars. We found no high-certainty evidence for the effects of any therapy included. Randomised controlled trials and systematic reviews related to acne and acne scars had limitations (low methodological quality). We could not summarise the evidence for topical retinoids and topical antibiotics due to insufficient high-quality systematic reviews. Future research should consider pooled analysis of data on new emerging drugs for acne treatment (e.g. clascoterone) and focus more on acne complications.

### An open label, phase 2 study of MABp1 monotherapy for the treatment of acne vulgaris and psychiatric comorbidity [^a146ca78]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Acne vulgaris is a common inflammatory skin disorder. There remain few rapid, safe, and effective therapy options for patients with moderate to severe acne vulgaris that also address psychological comorbidities such as anxiety.

Objective

To assess the efficacy of interleukin 1 alpha blockade in patients with moderate to severe acne vulgaris using the true human monoclonal antibody MABp1.

Methods

Eleven patients were administered open-label, subcutaneous injections of MABp1 over a six-week period. Objectives were assessment of safety, change in inflammatory lesion count and change in psychosocial functioning using two validated questionnaires.

Results

There were no serious adverse events, or adverse events greater than grade I. Median inflammatory lesion counts decreased 36% (IQR -44% to 1%). Anxiety scores improved (from median 6 to 1) as well as self-image assessment (2.3 ± 0.9 to 2.1 ± 0.1) as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the modified Body Image Disturbance Questionnaire.

Conclusion

Patients had rapid improvement of skin lesions, as well as psychosocial functioning and anxiety. MABp1 may provide a safe and effective means for treating inflammatory acne lesions and. Further studies using this antibody are warranted in this patient population.

### Norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol (tri-legest Fe) [^9cb3a4f1]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

EFFECTIVENESS OF COMBINED ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

Oral contraceptives or "birth control pills" or "the pill" are used to prevent pregnancy and are more effective than other nonsurgical methods of birth control. When they are taken correctly, the chance of becoming pregnant is less than 1% (1 pregnancy per 100 women per year of use) when used perfectly, without missing any pills. Typical failure rates are actually 5% per year. The chance of becoming pregnant increases with each missed pill during a menstrual cycle.

In comparison, typical failure rates for other methods of birth control during the first year of use are as follows:

Tri-Legest Fe may also be taken to treat moderate acne if all of the following are true:

Your doctor says it is safe for you to use the pill
You are at least 15 years old
You have started having menstrual periods
You want to use the pill for birth control
You plan to stay on the pill for at least 6 months
Your acne has not improved with acne medicines that you put on your skin.

Norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol users who started with about 74 acne pimples had about 42 pimples after 6 months of treatment. Placebo users who started with about 72 acne pimples had about 49 pimples after six months of treatment. Use Tri-Legest Fe to treat acne only if you want the pill for birth control and plan to stay on it for at least 6 months.

### The psychological burden of skin diseases: a cross-sectional multicenter study among dermatological out-patients in 13 European countries [^55d2302f]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Despite the high prevalence of skin conditions and the strong association of psychiatric disorders with skin disease, the true extent of psychological co-morbidity across Europe is not known. This is important because the care of patients with skin disease may be inadequate if their psychological problems are not also recognized and treated.

The Global Burden of Diseases Study recently demonstrated that skin diseases were the fourth leading cause of nonfatal disease burden. Assessing the burden of skin disease is crucial for evidence-based allocation of resources and to position Dermatology in a global health perspective, but the choice of appropriate method remains a challenge. A wider perspective of the burden of physical conditions is demonstrated by the significant occurrence of depression in diabetes, asthma, heart disease, and arthritis. It is predicted that depressive disorder will be the second cause of disease burden worldwide by 2030, and the contribution of mental health to the burden of physical conditions is stressed in the context of the World Health Organization strategies by their slogan "there is no health without mental health". The co-occurrence of mood disorders and physical conditions has been emphasized by the World Mental Health Survey. Measurement of the mental health of patients with physical diseases may therefore appropriately contribute to the overall measurement of the burden of disease.

European studies have shown that patients with atopic eczema, hand eczema, acne, and hidradenitis suppurativa have an increased risk of depression, and 10% of patients with psoriasis are clinically depressed. Although anxiety is a separate entity, it is less studied and mostly described as accompanying depression in dermatological patients with psoriasis and occupational eczema. Population-based studies have shown significant associations of acne, eczema, and psoriasis with suicidal thoughts. In a study from Germany, 16% of patients with atopic dermatitis had suicidal ideation compared with 1% of the controls.

Little is known about psychological co-morbidity of common skin diseases from a global perspective. The aim of this study was to investigate the co-occurrence of depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts in patients with common skin diseases across several European countries.

### Managing the patient with psychiatric issues in dermatologic practice [^6d81f0ba]. Clinics in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Patients often communicate emotions through their bodies and physical symptoms; the skin commonly serves as a means of expression in the patient-doctor relationship. It is important for the dermatologist to be able to indentify psychological issues that manifest in the skin and the interplay between psychiatric and dermatologic conditions. Delusional parasitosis, dermatitis artefacta, trichotillomania, and somatoform disorders all represent dermatologic conditions with underlying emotional causes. Many chronic dermatoses, such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and acne, modulate and are influenced by psychosocial factors. Special issues, including significant medication interactions and the treatment of the "difficult" patient, are reviewed.

### Comorbidity screening in hidradenitis suppurativa: evidence-based recommendations from the US and Canadian Hidradenitis Suppurativa Foundations [^4f51863e]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is associated with comorbidities that contribute to poor health, impaired life quality, and mortality risk.

Objective

To provide evidence-based screening recommendations for comorbidities linked to HS.

Methods

Systematic reviews were performed to summarize evidence on the prevalence and incidence of 30 comorbidities in patients with HS relative to the general population. The screening recommendation for each comorbidity was informed by the consistency and quality of existing studies, disease prevalence, and magnitude of association, as well as benefits, harms, and feasibility of screening. The level of evidence and strength of corresponding screening recommendation were graded by using the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy (SORT) criteria.

Results

Screening is recommended for the following comorbidities: acne, dissecting cellulitis of the scalp, pilonidal disease, pyoderma gangrenosum, depression, generalized anxiety disorder, suicide, smoking, substance use disorder, polycystic ovary syndrome, obesity, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory bowel disease, spondyloarthritis, and sexual dysfunction. It is also recommended to screen patients with Down syndrome for HS. The decision to screen for specific comorbidities may vary with patient risk factors. The role of the dermatologist in screening varies according to comorbidity.

Limitations

Screening recommendations represent one component of a comprehensive care strategy.

Conclusions

Dermatologists should support screening efforts to identify comorbid conditions in HS.

### Psychological factors in skin diseases: stress and skin: facts and controversies [^2e53707b]. Clinics in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Psychological stress (PS) has long been related to many common skin diseases and conditions, thought to be the cause of their onset or aggravation. Although clinical experience is often in concordance with this notion, apparently scientific proof can sometimes be challenging rather than straight forward. Although many data have been published, it appears that not enough good statistical evidence exists to support them. The difficulty in validating beyond a doubt the stress-skin interactions has rendered some skepticism among physicians. The gap between clinical expertise and problematic clinical research data has led scientists to bypass the need to tackle the question directly by searching the evidence in basic science.

### Baseline characteristics from UNITE: an observational, international, multicentre registry to evaluate hidradenitis suppurativa (acne inversa) in clinical practice [^e1bf2a27]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Depression and anxiety are strongly associated with HS and are significant factors affecting quality of life for these patients. A retrospective case–control study reported that 58% of patients with HS had a psychiatric disorder. Psychiatric comorbidities reported in UNITE at baseline included 13.3% with depression and 9.6% with other cognitive/psychiatric disorders, including anxiety. However, the patient-reported Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale outcome from UNITE showed that 58% of patients reported anxiety and 30% reported depression at baseline. This suggests that psychological disorders may be under-diagnosed and/or under-reported in this population and confirms the need for adequate multidisciplinary care and screening for these comorbidities.

Quality of life at baseline in UNITE was significantly impaired in adults, and scores worsened markedly as disease severity increased. Additional quality-of-life patient-reported outcomes from UNITE are addressed in a separate publication.

Limitations of this analysis include the bias that can be present in observational studies, including methods of patient selection, selective recall, inconsistent reporting, measurement errors, and under-reporting, especially of information not apparent to the data collector, such as comorbidities and prior treatment. Another potential limitation is the method of describing disease severity and the potential influence of disease severity on enrolment. Per the protocol, the original Hurley staging criteria were used as the method for defining severity, which is not necessarily correlated to disease activity at any given time. A newer method of Hurley staging has since been published, in which Hurley IC and IIC are classified as "severe", but this staging was not available at the time of data collection. In addition, while balancing of patients across Hurley stages was attempted, the vast majority enrolled had Hurley stage II and III disease; thus, their results may not be generalisable to the entire HS population. Although the majority of UNITE patients were enrolled in North American (68.9%) sites, these data contribute to the global characterisation of HS in patients in real-world clinical settings.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^ddfc1bbd]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Salicylic acid peels — prescribing information for comedonal acne lists dosing as follows: concentrations of 20–30% are available; Very superficial: 20% salicylic acid; Superficial: 30% salicylic acid; applied for 2–4 minutes depending on intensity of clinical response. Contraindications include lack of psychological stability and mental preparedness, unrealistic expectations, poor general health and nutritional status, isotretinoin therapy within the last 6 months, and active infection or open wounds (eg, herpes simplex, excoriations, or open acne cysts), with relative contraindications of history of abnormal scar formation or delayed wound healing, history of therapeutic radiation exposure, and history of rosacea, seborrheic dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, vitiligo, or active retinoid dermatitis.

What is Myorisan®?

Myorisan®is a medicine taken by mouth to treat the most severe form of acne (nodular acne) that cannot be cleared up by any other acne treatments, including antibiotics. Myorisan can cause serious side effects (see "What is the most important information I should know about Myorisan ® ?"). Myorisan®can only be:

- prescribed by doctors that are enrolled in the iPLEDGE REMS

- dispensed by a pharmacy that is enrolled with the iPLEDGE REMS

- given to patients who are enrolled in the iPLEDGE REMS and agree to do everything required in the program.

What is severe nodular acne?

Severe nodular acne is when many red, swollen, tender lumps form in the skin. These can be the size of pencil erasers or larger. If untreated, nodular acne can lead to permanent scars.

Who should not take Myorisan ®?

- Do not take Myorisan ® if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or become pregnant during Myorisan ® treatment. Myorisan®causes life-threatening birth defects. See "What is the most important information I should know about Myorisan ® ?"

- Do not take Myorisan ® if you are allergic to anything in it. See the end of this Medication Guide for a complete list of ingredients in Myorisan®.

### Management of acne vulgaris… [^baeaad51]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance Acne vulgaris is an inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous unit of the skin that primarily involves the face and trunk and affects approximately 9% of the population worldwide. Acne vulgaris can cause permanent physical scarring, negatively affect quality of life and self-image, and has been associated with increased rates of anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation. Topical therapies such as retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid, and/or combinations of topical agents are first-line treatments. When prescribed as a single therapy in a randomized trial of 207 patients, treatment with tretinoin 0. 025% gel reduced acne lesion counts at 12 weeks by 63% compared with baseline.

Combinations of topical agents with systemic agents are recommended for more severe disease. In a meta-analysis of 32 randomized clinical trials, COC was associated with reductions in inflammatory lesions by 62%, placebo was associated with a 26% reduction, and oral antibiotics were associated with a 58% reduction at 6-month follow-up. Isotretinoin is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating severe recalcitrant nodular acne but is often used to treat resistant or persistent moderate to severe acne, as well as acne that produces scarring or significant psychosocial distress. Conclusions and Relevance. Acne vulgaris affects approximately 9% of the population worldwide and approximately 85% of those aged 12 to 24 years.

First-line therapies are topical retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid, or combinations of topicals. For more severe disease, oral antibiotics such as doxycycline or minocycline, hormonal therapies such as combination oral conceptive agents or spironolactone, or isotretinoin are most effective.

### Depression and anxiety and their association with healthcare utilization in pediatric lupus and mixed connective tissue disease patients: a cross-sectional study [^602c4968]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

This cross-sectional analysis of a cohort of SLE and MCTD children and adolescents and their healthy peers adds to the sparse literature on mental health in pediatric SLE. We present novel data on prevalence rates of depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation for children and adolescents with SLE/MCTD, as well as estimates of the association of depression and anxiety symptoms with healthcare utilization for this population. Depression and anxiety symptoms were prevalent, affecting 34% of our cohort, with depression symptoms in 20%, anxiety in 22% and suicidal ideation in 14%. These estimates are similar to previous studies of pediatric patients with SLE that indicate a prevalence of 15–55% for depression and 15–20% for anxiety. The etiology of depression and anxiety in pediatric SLE and MCTD patients is likely complex and related several factors including: the psychological stress of dealing with a chronic illness during adolescence; inflammatory central nervous system (CNS) pathology related to SLE; direct steroid CNS effects and indirect steroid-related somatic effects (eg. appearance concern due to weight gain, acne and striae), as well as; hereditary and environmental factors.

### These dermatological disorders share the features of being caused by hyperactivity of androgen within the pilosebaceous follicle, and although not life threatening are the source of a considerable psychological and emotional burden for patients. foreword [^b0b59826]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Of particular interest in these case reports is the careful testing, imaging and examination used by these experienced practitioners to rule out other systemic causes of a PSU disorder. Dermatologists who are not willing to provide similar work-up should consider referring their patient out for these tests before starting the patient on OC.

The dermatologist in the USA is often confronted with a disease or constellation of symptoms for which there is not a drug that is US Food and Drug Administration approved. While there are many qualities that describe a good clinician, finding a safe and creative therapeutic option to improve a particular patient's condition is to me one of the most important. It is good to remember that EE/CMA is not available in the USA at this time, is not yet approved for the treatment of acne in patients seeking contraception, and probably will never receive regulatory approval for the less common disorders of hirsutism, FPHL and seborrhea.

OC are usually well tolerated but like any drug have potential side-effects and risks. In female patients who desire contraception and who also have a disorder of the PSU, using EE/CMA as the choice of contraception may be a good option.

Scarring due to HS was reported by 91.2% of patients overall and was more common in adults than in adolescents (92.8% and 78.5%, respectively). Scarring increased with Hurley stage (4.7%, 97.2%, and 100% for Hurley stage I, II, and III, respectively; Table 4). The most common areas affected by scarring were pelvic/pubic/genital, followed by axilla (69.4% and 60.8% of patients, respectively).

### Psychiatric and psychologic aspects of chronic skin diseases [^0251b5de]. Clinics in Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic skin diseases can substantially affect a patient's physical, psychologic, and social well-being. Physicians may play a critical role in identifying and managing the psychologic sequelae of the most common chronic skin conditions. Acne, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, vitiligo, alopecia areata, and hidradenitis suppurativa are chronic dermatologic diseases that put patients at high risk for symptoms of depression, anxiety, and decreased quality of life. Both general and disease-specific scales exist to assess the quality of life in patients with chronic skin disease, the most common being the Dermatology Life Quality Index. The general management approach to the patient with chronic skin disease should incorporate acknowledgment and validation of the patient's struggles; patient education on the potential effect of disease and prognosis; medical management of the dermatologic lesions; coaching on stress management; and psychotherapy. Psychotherapies include talk therapy (eg, cognitive behavioral therapy), arousal-reducing therapies (eg, meditation, relaxation), and behavioral therapies (eg, habit reversal therapy). Improved understanding, identification, and management of the psychiatric and psychologic aspects of the most common chronic skin conditions by dermatologists and other health care providers may positively affect patient outcomes.

### The importance of mindfulness in psychosocial distress and quality of life in dermatology patients [^4f332754]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Patients and methods

Ethical approval was gained from the National Health Service, Tyne and Wear South research ethics committee. Participants were recruited from the dermatology department of a regional teaching hospital in the U.K. The inclusion criteria were (i) age > 16 years; (ii) a visible condition such as psoriasis, eczema, dermatitis, acne or hair disorders; and (iii) having sufficient English to complete the questionnaires and provide informed consent. As the study focused on skin disease, primary psychiatric diagnoses affecting the skin (e.g. trichotillomania, delusions of parasitosis) and skin cancer were excluded. Participants meeting the inclusion criteria were invited to participate following their dermatology consultation. Participants could complete the questionnaires in the clinic or at home. Questionnaires completed in the clinic were completed independently in the waiting room and returned to reception.

Data analysis

Firstly, data were analysed to determine clinically significant levels of anxiety, depression and social anxiety using cut‐off scores. Secondly, associations were tested between demographic variables (age, sex, ethnicity), clinical variables (type of skin condition, area of body affected, subjective severity), mindfulness and psychosocial distress (social anxiety, anxiety, depression, skin shame and dermatological quality of life) using t ‐tests, or correlations as appropriate. Thirdly, hierarchical regressions were conducted to examine the amount of variance in psychosocial distress explained by the five facets of mindfulness. Demographic and clinical variables found to be associated with psychological distress were entered at step one, followed by the five facets of mindfulness at step two.

Participants

Of the 180 patients approached, 120 agreed to participate in the research (67% response rate). Reasons for declining to participate were not collected. The participants were predominantly female and white. The most frequently reported skin conditions were psoriasis, eczema, alopecia and acne. Participants not reporting their skin condition might not yet have been provided with their diagnosis. Table 1 lists full details of the sample.

### The psychological burden of skin diseases: a cross-sectional multicenter study among dermatological out-patients in 13 European countries [^06d23acc]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

To compare the prevalence between the disease groups and the controls, we used the χ²-test for dichotomous variables. Multivariate logistic regression models were tested to study the associations between main outcome variables (depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation) and groups (patients and controls). The regression models were calculated for each disease separately, adjusting for gender, age, socio-economic status, stress, and co-morbidity.

The ORs were calculated from the estimated regression coefficients B from the logistic regressions. The exponential of the coefficient gives the OR. In the first step, we calculated the crude ORs and in the second adjusted ORs simultaneously controlling for potential confounding factors (gender, age, socio-economic status, perceived stress, co-morbidities, depression (only for the logistic regression for suicidal ideation) with a 95% CI.

In the regression models the Netherlands, France, and Italy centers were excluded because no controls were recruited at these centers. Other analyses were performed with the complete data set. Cases with missing data for single variables were excluded from the analysis when necessary.

The differences in the percentage of diagnoses between the centers represent the prevalence of diagnoses in different countries. These differences were accepted as reflecting the real life situation in different populations of dermatological out-patients: for instance, Turkey has more acne patients, as a result of the younger average age of the population in Turkey.

### Budesonide — Budesonide — enteric coated [^0ebdea24]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Budesonide capsules (enteric coated) and other medicines may affect each other causing side effects.

How should I take budesonide capsules (enteric coated)?

Take budesonide capsules (enteric coated) exactly as your healthcare provider tells you.
Your healthcare provider will tell you how many budesonide capsules (enteric coated) to take.

Your healthcare provider may change your dose if needed.
Take budesonide capsules (enteric coated) 1 time each day in the morning.
Take budesonide capsules (enteric coated) whole. Do not chew or crush budesonide capsules (enteric coated) before swallowing.
If you take too much budesonide capsules (enteric coated) call your healthcare provider right away or go to the nearest hospital emergency room.

What should I avoid while taking budesonide capsules (enteric coated)?

Do not drink grapefruit juice during your treatment with budesonide capsules (enteric coated).

Drinking grapefruit juice can increase the level of budesonide capsules (enteric coated) in your blood.

What are the possible side effects of budesonide capsules (enteric coated)?

Budesonide capsules (enteric coated) may cause serious side effects, including:

Effects of having too much corticosteroid medicine in your blood (hypercorticism). Long-time use of budesonide capsules (enteric coated) can cause you to have too much corticosteroid medicine in your blood. Tell your healthcare provider if you have any of the following signs and symptoms of hypercorticism:
acne
bruise easily
rounding of your face (moon face)
ankle swelling
thicker or more hair on your body and face
a fatty pad or hump between your shoulders (buffalo hump)
pink or purple stretch marks on the skin of your abdomen, thighs, breasts and arms
Adrenal suppression. When budesonide capsules (enteric coated) are taken for a long period of time (chronic use), adrenal suppression can happen. This is a condition in which the adrenal glands do not make enough steroid hormones. Symptoms of adrenal suppression include: tiredness, weakness, nausea and vomiting and low blood pressure. Tell your healthcare provider if you are under stress or have any symptoms of adrenal suppression during treatment with budesonide capsules (enteric coated).
Worsening of allergies. If you take certain other corticosteroid medicines to treat allergies, switching to budesonide capsules (enteric coated) may cause your allergies to come back. These allergies may include a skin condition called eczema or inflammation inside your nose (rhinitis). Tell your healthcare provider if any of your allergies become worse while taking budesonide capsules (enteric coated).
Increased risk of infection. Budesonide capsules (enteric coated) weakens your immune system. Taking medicines that weaken your immune system makes you more likely to get infections. Avoid contact with people who have contagious diseases such as chicken pox or measles, while taking budesonide capsules (enteric coated). Tell your healthcare provider right away if you come in contact with anyone who has chicken pox or measles.

### Isotretinoin and adverse neuropsychiatric outcomes: retrospective cohort study using routine data [^17741704]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Propensity score matching was used to improve comparability between the isotretinoin‐exposed and control (isotretinoin‐unexposed) cohorts in relation to the type of acne, comorbidities and history of mental health problems, that is, to control for confounders that could bias the comparisons. For propensity score matching, we used the TriNetX built‐in algorithm, which was based on 1: 1 nearest neighbour matching with a caliper of 0.1 SDs. We included covariates occurring any time before the index prescription or event, and the same set of covariates were used to match isotretinoin‐exposed cohort and the three unexposed control cohorts.

Cohorts were balanced at baseline for the following covariates: age at index prescription or event; sex; ethnicity/race; mental and behavioural disorders because of psychoactive substance use; schizophrenia, schizotypal, delusional and other non‐mood psychotic disorders; mood (affective) disorders; anxiety, dissociative, stress‐related, somatoform and other nonpsychotic mental disorders; sleep disorders not because of a substance or known physiological condition; disorders of adult personality and behaviour; behavioural and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence; sleep disorders; vasomotor and allergic rhinitis; asthma; dermatitis and eczema; acne vulgaris; acne conglobata; other acne; unspecified acne; suicidal ideations; suicide attempt; intentional self‐harm; and dispensed prescriptions for sedatives and hypnotics; antidepressants; antipsychotics; and glucocorticoids. Patients in the isotretinoin cohort were successfully matched with patients in the oral antibiotics cohort (92%, 28398/30866), in the topical anti‐acne agents cohort (99%, 30 435/30 866) and in the acne control cohort without dispensed prescriptions for the selected acne medications (92%, 28 417/30 866).

Tables S2–S4 (see Supporting Information) show the distributions of the patient characteristics before and after matching at baseline for the isotretinoin and for the three control cohorts. After matching, the cohorts were balanced for all the covariates included, that is, all standard differences were < 0·1 after propensity score matching.

### The mental health burden in acne vulgaris and rosacea: an analysis of the US national inpatient sample [^40473c3d]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Little is known about the mental health (MH) hospitalization among patients with acne and rosacea.

Aims

To determine the MH disorders and cost burden associated with acne and rosacea.

Methods

Data were examined from the 2002–2012 US National Inpatient Sample, comprising a sample of ~20% of all US paediatric and adult hospitalizations (n = 87 053 155 admissions).

Results

A diagnosis of ≥ 1 MH disorder was much more common among all inpatients with vs. those without a diagnosis of acne (43.7% vs. 20.0%, respectively) and rosacea (35.1% vs. 20.0%, respectively). In multivariable logistic regression models controlling for sex, age, race/ethnicity and insurance status, acne (adjusted OR = 13.02; 95% CI 11.75–14.42) and rosacea (adjusted OR = 1.70; 95% CI 1.56–1.95) were associated with significantly higher odds of a primary admission for an MH disorder (13 and 8, respectively, of 15 MH disorders examined). Both acne and rosacea were associated with higher risk of mood, anxiety, impulse control and personality disorders, and with > $2 million of excess mean annual costs of hospitalization for MH disorders in the USA.

Conclusion

In this study, inpatients with acne or rosacea had increased odds of comorbid MH disorders. In particular, there was an increased number of hospital admissions secondary to a primary MH disorder with coexistent acne/rosacea. MH comorbidities were associated with considerable excess costs among inpatients with acne or rosacea.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome, affective symptoms, and neuroactive steroids: a focus on allopregnanolone [^7c7f3d50]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Associations Between Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and Symptoms of Depression and Anxiety

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is both common and costly. It is the most widespread endocrine disorder of reproductive-aged women globally and has a prevalence ranging from 4 to 21%, depending upon the criteria used for diagnosis and the population studied. Costs for medical visits related to PCOS in the USA are estimated at $1.16 billion annually. A syndrome of heterogenous manifestations and severity, PCOS is typically diagnosed based on exclusion of other causes and the presence of several clinical characteristics: the eponymous cystic ovaries, irregular menstrual cycles or anovulation, and hyperandrogenism with its multiple manifestations. Sequelae include infertility and obstetrical complications; symptoms of hyperandrogenism including hirsutism, acne, and alopecia; and cardiometabolic risks including dyslipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, diabetes, and hypertension. Treatment has historically focused on improving reproductive function and managing symptoms such as weight gain, insulin resistance, hirsutism, and acne.

Less well studied is PCOS's link to comorbid depression and anxiety symptoms. A meta-analysis of more than 3000 subjects found that twice as many women with PCOS had depressive symptoms compared to women without PCOS (36% vs. 14%), and that over four times as many women with PCOS had anxiety symptoms (42% vs. 9%). This association only strengthened when severity of symptoms was considered. The same study found that women with PCOS had moderate to severe depressive symptoms at an odds ratio of 4.18 compared to women without PCOS and moderate to severe anxiety symptoms at an odds ratio of 6.55. When restricted to clinical depressive or anxiety disorders, women with PCOS continue to be diagnosed at increased rates. Alarmingly, one small study found that women with PCOS attempted suicide at 7 times the rate of women without PCOS.

### Impact of age on premenstrual syndrome prevalence and severity: a population-based survey in Brazil [^f26e447f]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Study design

The study protocol, approved by the Research Ethics Committee (registration no. 33794520.1.0000.8098), followed ethical guidelines from Resolution 466/2012, Operational Standard 001/2013, and related resolutions.

This observational, retrospective study utilized anonymized data from the Market Research Programs (MRP) database, ensuring confidentiality and security.

2.2 Data collection

Data were collected via self‐reported electronic questionnaires administered from February 2019 to March 2020 to women aged 20–49 years. The study encompassed 303 voluntary private healthcare clinics across 22 Brazilian states and the federal district, covering 168 cities. Participants provided informed consent and completed an adapted version of the premenstrual symptoms screening tool (PSST), validated in Brazil. The PSST, which employs a retrospective, self‐administered format utilizes a four‐point Likert scale to evaluate the severity of psycho‐emotional (irritability, anxiety and tension, decreased interest in routine activities, depression and sadness, overeating, concentration difficulties, emotional instability) and physical symptoms (headache, acne and oily skin, edema, weight gain, breast tenderness, exacerbation of immunoallergic conditions) based on severity (0 = none; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe).

Participants meeting the diagnostic criteria for PMD included the presence of specific symptoms during the 15 days prior to menstruation over three consecutive menstrual cycles, according to established guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (AGOC) and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (RCOG). Participants who answered, "Bothers a lot" to the question "How much do the mentioned symptoms interfere with your daily life?" and reported at least one or more psycho‐emotional or somatic symptoms were included.

### Chronic administration of 13-cis-retinoic acid induces depression-like behavior by altering the activity of dentate granule cells [^fbf979ba]. Neurotherapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we investigated the mechanism underlying 13- cis -RA-induced depression, focusing mainly on the role of electrophysiological alterations in DGCs, such as synaptic transmission and intrinsic membrane properties. Our study mimicked the effects of chronic clinical 13- cis -RA application in adolescents because acne is predominantly regarded as a skin disorder affecting adolescents. We found that 13- cis -RA treatment reliably induced depression-like behavior but not anxiety-like behavior. The increased neuronal activity in the DG was implied by elevated c-Fos expression levels in chronically 13- cis -RA-treated mice. Furthermore, the alteration of neuronal activity was assessed by obtaining whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of DGCs, and we found that chronic 13- cis -RA treatment shifted the excitatory-inhibitory balance toward excitation and increased intrinsic excitability. Silencing these neurons was sufficient to reverse 13- cis -RA-induced depression-like behavior. Thus, our findings indicated DGCs as a potential cellular target for the direct alleviation of RA-induced depression.

A significant body of evidence indicates that chronic 13- cis -RA administration is involved in both clinical depression and animal models of depression. Clinically, 13- cis -RA is a highly effective drug for severe acne but is associated with depression and suicide, which has attracted major attention for a long time. In addition, animal model responses to 13- cis -RA administration support an association with psychiatric adverse effects, including depression and anxiety. Similar to previous studies, our data showed that chronic RA treatment reliably induced depression-like behavior. However, our results differed from those of previous studies reporting that chronic RA treatment also induced anxiety-like behavior. Although depression and anxiety probably share some common neurophysiological mechanisms and behavioral manifestations, mechanisms associated with the behavioral appearances of depression and anxiety have not yet been completely understood. The differences in these results are likely due to the differences in age period (i.e. adolescent vs. adult), species (i.e. mice vs. rats), and the method of administration (i.e. ip vs. ICV) or dose of the drugs.

### Psychiatric and psychological co-morbidity in patients with dermatologic disorders: epidemiology and management [^4afa332f]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Psychiatric and psychological factors play an important role in at least 30% of dermatologic disorders. In many cases the impact of the skin disorder upon the quality of life is a stronger predictor of psychiatric morbidity than the clinical severity of the disorder as per physician ratings. Furthermore, in certain disorders such as acne and psoriasis, the psychiatric co-morbidity, which can be associated with psychiatric emergencies such as suicide, is an important measure of the overall disability experienced by the patient. The severity of depression and increased suicide risk are not always directly correlated with the clinical severity of the dermatologic disorder. Consideration of psychiatric and psychosocial factors is important both for the management, and for some aspects of secondary and tertiary prevention of a wide range of dermatologic disorders. It is useful to use a biopsychosocial model which takes into account the psychological (e.g. psychiatric comorbidity such as major depression and the impact of the skin disorder on the psychological aspects of quality of life) and social (e.g. impact upon social and occupational functioning) factors, in addition to the primary dermatologic factors, in the management of the patient. Some dermatology patients are likely to benefit from psychotherapeutic interventions and psychotropic agents for the management of the psychosocial comorbidity, in addition to the standard dermatologic therapies for their skin disorder.

### Prevalence of comorbidities among pediatric patients with hidradenitis suppurativa: a meta-analysis [^97d94979]. JAMA Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease characterized by painful nodules in intertriginous regions that affects many pediatric patients. A significant proportion of patients with pediatric-onset HS may experience comorbidities, including metabolic and psychiatric disorders, adversely impacting their quality of life.

Objective

To evaluate the association between HS and relevant comorbidities in pediatric patients and determine the overall pooled prevalence of comorbidities in pediatric patients with HS.

Data Sources

Embase, PubMed/MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Central Register were searched on February 20, 2025, from database inception with no restrictions.

Study Selection

Original investigations that reported on prevalence or association between pediatric HS and comorbidities were included. The search included key search terms for pediatric HS and different categories of comorbidities. Two independent authors performed screening and full-text review.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Extraction was done by 2 authors independently using a template. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence. Data were pooled using random-effects modeling.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Meta-analyses of proportions were completed to estimate pooled prevalence rates, categorizing the data by specific comorbidities (obesity, overweight, anxiety, and others).

Results

A total of 19 studies, encompassing 17 267 pediatric patients with HS and 8 259 944 controls, were included. Pediatric patients with HS included in studies were predominantly female (mean of 76.7% [11 683 of 15 232]). The most prevalent comorbidities were acne vulgaris (pooled proportion, 43%; 95% CI, 21–65), obesity (pooled proportion, 37%; 95% CI, 27–46), anxiety (pooled proportion, 18%; 95% CI, 4–31), and hirsutism (pooled proportion, 14%; 95% CI, 6–21). Multiple studies reported on the concurrence of pediatric HS and obesity or depression (GRADE: moderate certainty), and 3 studies reported an association with diabetes (GRADE: low certainty).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, pediatric patients with HS had increased prevalence of chronic medical and psychiatric comorbidities, highlighting the potential benefit of a multidisciplinary approach.

### An increase in normetanephrine in hair follicles of acne lesions through the sympatho-adrenal medullary system in acne patients with anxiety [^59ea24d2]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris, a chronic inflammatory skin disease, has been associated with not only sebaceous gland dysfunction but also various endogenous and exogenous stresses. Since sebaceous glands are under neuroendocrine control, including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and neuro-autocrine mechanisms, it remains unclear how psychological stress relates to the pathogenesis of acne. In this study, we investigated the relationship between psychological stress and catecholamine in acne lesions from 18 patients with mild or moderate acne. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) revealed that all patients were anxious, with six having low anxiety and 12 high anxiety. Salivary α-amylase activity (sAA), which is regulated by the sympatho-adrenal medullary (SAM) system, positively correlated with the STAI State Anxiety scores (STAI-S) and was significantly detectable in acne patients with high rather than low anxiety. In addition, the level of normetanephrine, but not metanephrine, both of which are catecholamine metabolites, in hair follicles of acne lesions also positively correlated with the STAI-S. Furthermore, the normetanephrine level was higher in patients with high rather than low anxiety, whereas there was no change in metanephrine in the hair follicles of the acne lesions. Moreover, neither the sAA nor metanephrine and normetanephrine in the acne lesions was related to acne severity in the patients. Thus, these results provide novel evidence that a SAM system-associated increase of normetanephrine level in hair follicles is involved in the acne pathology of patients with anxiety.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^dd1b69c5]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Isotretinoin — recommendations for acne vulgaris: Oral isotretinoin is recommended for the treatment of severe nodular acne, and oral isotretinoin is appropriate for the treatment of moderate acne that is treatment-resistant or for the management of acne that is producing physical scarring or psychosocial distress. Low-dose isotretinoin can be used to effectively treat acne and reduce the frequency and severity of medication-related side effects; intermittent dosing of isotretinoin is not recommended. Routine monitoring of liver function tests, serum cholesterol, and triglycerides at baseline and again until response to treatment is established is recommended, whereas routine monitoring of complete blood count is not recommended. All patients treated with isotretinoin must adhere to the iPLEDGE risk management program, and females of child-bearing potential taking isotretinoin should be counseled regarding various contraceptive methods including user-independent forms. Prescribing physicians also should monitor their patients for any indication of inflammatory bowel disease and depressive symptoms and educate their patients about the potential risks with isotretinoin.

### Nonpharmacologic treatments in psychodermatology [^8e6a8af2]. Dermatologic Clinics (2002). Low credibility.

The author believes that psychocutaneous medicine has indeed come of age and is being incorporated into mainstream medical practice. Patients presenting to dermatologists today are more sophisticated and are frequently dissatisfied with traditional medical therapies. They actively seek alternative approaches and adjuncts to standard treatments. In contrast to many other "alternative" (or) "holistic" treatments offered through non-medical venues, dermatologists can assure their patients that controlled studies support the efficacy of psychocutaneous techniques in improving many dermatologic conditions. Psoriasis, rosacea, herpes simplex, body dysmorphic disorder, acne, eczema, urticaria, neurotic excoriations, excoriated acne, trichotillomania, dysesthetic syndromes, and delusions parasitosis are included in this incomplete list. The author believes it is helpful for both the patient and therapist to define concrete and realistic goals for psychocutaneous intervention. Concrete observable or measurable goals can help the patient and clinician gauge therapeutic progress and success. Specifically, goals can include reduction in pruritus (rating severity from 1–10), decreased scratching activity, decreased plaque extent or thickness, decreased number of urticarial plaques, decreased flushing, decreased anxiety, decreased anger, decreased social embarrassment, decreased social withdrawal, and improved sleep. More global goals can include an improved sense of well-being, increased sense of control, and enhanced acceptance of some of the inevitable aspects of a given skin disease. Cure should never be a goal, because most disorders amenable to psychocutaneous techniques are chronic in nature; thus, cure as an endpoint would only lead to disappointment. The author encourages dermatologists to align themselves with what he euphemistically calls "a skin-emotion specialist". The skin-emotion specialist may be a psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, biofeedback therapist, or other mental health or behavioral specialist. Patients are more likely to accept a referral to a "skin-emotion specialist", because this term destigmatizes psychologic interventions. Incorporating these techniques and specialists into a clinical practice will expand therapeutic horizons and improve the quality of life of many of the patients afflicted with chronic skin disease. A final caveat must be offered about attempting to make prognostic statements regarding the likelihood of therapeutic success. Although all patients can potentially benefit from psychocutaneous interventions, those with severe psychopathology and poor pretreatment functional status are likely to be more difficult to treat and to achieve less optimal outcomes. Patients with personality disorders such as borderline, narcissistic, and schizotypal disorders, and patients with any active psychotic process certainly constitute a more resistant and difficult population with whom therapeutic success is less likely. These patients, however, are often the ones in the greatest subjective distress and certainly can profit from any of the described interventions. Quoting W. Mitchell Sams, Jr., "although the physician is a scientist and clinician, he or she is and must be something more. A doctor is a caretaker of the patient's person — a professional advisor, guiding the patient through some of life's most difficult journeys. Only the clergy share this responsibility with us". This commitment is and must always be the guiding force in the provision of comprehensive and compatient patient care.

### Psychological therapies and mind-body techniques in the management of dermatologic diseases: a systematic review [^846f5a8a]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

There is a clear link between skin disease and psychological factors and this relationship works both ways: skin diseases can cause psychological distress and psychological issues can worsen skin disease. There are a number of therapies that approach this problem from the psychological side and may be useful, especially as adjunctive therapies in select patients.

Objective

The aim of this review was to determine the efficacy of various psychological therapies and mind-body techniques in the management of common dermatologic diseases in individuals of all ages.

Methods

A systematic review of PubMed, Elsevier, and Wiley was performed for studies investigating psychological and mind-body interventions in the management of various skin diseases. Both physical and non-physical treatment outcomes were considered. Studies were evaluated for both risk of bias and overall quality of evidence.

Results

A total of 40 articles studying unique sets of dermatological patients receiving psychological therapies or mind-body interventions were identified. Of the 40 included articles encompassing 3112 patients, 18 investigated these interventions in psoriasis management while 15 focused on atopic dermatitis. The remaining studies investigated vitiligo (2), pruritus (2), acne vulgaris (2), and acne excoriée (1).

Conclusions

Based on the analysis of included studies and an assessment of their quality of evidence, the most promising interventions are cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based interventions, and habit reversal therapy.

### Evaluating the cutaneous manifestations and associated comorbidities of childhood obesity [^6eb0c364]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Childhood obesity is a pressing public health concern linked to various comorbidities. The prevalence amongst pediatric patients is rising, impacting short‐ and long‐term health outcomes, previously thought to be mostly seen in adults. Some of these conditions include metabolic syndrome, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), depression and anxiety, and increased risk of mortality with age due to cardiovascular problems.

Obesity can also cause alterations in skin barrier function, sebaceous glands and sebum production, skin infections, and wound healing. Studies have linked obesity in adults to psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), acne vulgaris, infections, and rosacea. In children, obesity exacerbates atopic dermatitis, increases the risk of psoriatic arthritis, and worsens HS. Despite the well‐documented association in adults and children between obesity and skin conditions, few studies have evaluated these with a large sample size, while also simultaneously evaluating associated comorbidities. By using a population health database, this study aims to highlight the emerging public health crisis and emphasize the role of pediatric dermatologists in recognizing early dermatological signs of obesity in children.

### Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol (Yaz) [^a2203199]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Yaz is a combination of drospirenone, a progestin, and ethinyl estradiol, an estrogen, indicated for use by females of reproductive potential to:

Prevent pregnancy. (1.1)
Treat symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) for females of reproductive potential who choose to use an oral contraceptive for contraception. (1.2)
Treat moderate acne for women at least 14 years old only if the patient desires an oral contraceptive for birth control. (1.3)

1.1 Oral Contraceptive

Yaz®is indicated for use by females of reproductive potential to prevent pregnancy.

1.2 Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD)

Yaz is also indicated for the treatment of symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) in females of reproductive potential who choose to use an oral contraceptive as their method of contraception. The effectiveness of Yaz for PMDD when used for more than three menstrual cycles has not been evaluated.

The essential features of PMDD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-4th edition (DSM-IV) include markedly depressed mood, anxiety or tension, affective lability, and persistent anger or irritability. Other features include decreased interest in usual activities, difficulty concentrating, lack of energy, change in appetite or sleep, and feeling out of control. Physical symptoms associated with PMDD include breast tenderness, headache, joint and muscle pain, bloating and weight gain. In this disorder, these symptoms occur regularly during the luteal phase and remit within a few days following onset of menses; the disturbance markedly interferes with work or school, or with usual social activities and relationships with others. Diagnosis is made by healthcare providers according to DSM-IV criteria, with symptomatology assessed prospectively over at least two menstrual cycles. In making the diagnosis, care should be taken to rule out other cyclical mood disorders.

Yaz has not been evaluated for the treatment of premenstrual syndrome (PMS).

1.3 Acne

Yaz is indicated for the treatment of moderate acne vulgaris in women at least 14 years of age, who have no known contraindications to oral contraceptive therapy and have achieved menarche. Yaz should be used for the treatment of acne only if the patient desires an oral contraceptive for birth control.
