## Question

does increasing the dose of ace inhibitor help with post-pci

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether increasing the dose of an ACE inhibitor after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) improves outcomes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why ACE inhibitors are used after PCI. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines recommend regarding ACE inhibitor use and whether they address dose escalation. Next, I will examine direct and indirect evidence on dose–response, including randomized and observational data. After that, I need to check for any signals of harm with higher doses in the post-PCI or postoperative setting. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded recommendation and note any uncertainties that warrant caution or further study.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and rationale. After PCI, especially in acute coronary syndromes, ACE inhibitors are part of guideline-directed medical therapy to reduce mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events via effects on ventricular remodeling, endothelial function, and atherothrombotic risk, with benefits extending beyond blood pressure lowering in appropriate patients [^a43cc02b] [^a1db1417] [^8ba0f8b2].

> Wait, let me verify what contemporary guidelines actually say about ACE inhibitors after PCI and whether they endorse dose escalation. The 2023 ESC ACS guideline recommends considering routine ACE inhibitor initiation in all ACS patients regardless of LVEF, and the 2025 ACC/AHA/ACEP ACS guideline recommends initiating an ACE inhibitor or ARB in high-risk ACS patients to reduce death and MACE. Neither guideline provides a recommendation to routinely escalate ACE inhibitor dose beyond standard targets, nor do they suggest that higher-than-usual doses confer additional post-PCI benefit, which is a key absence I should not overlook [^a1db1417] [^8ba0f8b2] [^a5a5f6e0] [^6ad5b4c1].

> I will now examine direct evidence on dose and outcomes. The most relevant randomized signal comes from the PARIS trial, which tested high-dose quinapril (40 mg daily) started within 48 hours after stenting in patients with the ACE DD genotype. Contrary to expectations, quinapril increased late lumen loss and restenosis versus placebo, suggesting harm rather than benefit in that specific context, so I should be cautious about extrapolating dose escalation to routine post-PCI care [^a9dc33b3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should review broader dose–response data outside the immediate post-PCI window. In heart failure, meta-analyses comparing high- versus low-dose ACE inhibitors show no consistent mortality advantage for higher doses, though higher doses may improve symptoms and reduce hospitalizations at the cost of more adverse effects; this supports the concept of a ceiling effect and the importance of tolerability rather than pushing doses aggressively in stable patients after PCI [^b6b73a87] [^b4f48c6f].

> Next, I should review indirect but clinically relevant evidence on ACE inhibitor use after PCI. Observational and registry-based studies show that ACE inhibitor use after PCI is associated with lower mortality and fewer adverse cardiovascular events, but these analyses rarely isolate dose intensity and cannot establish causality for escalation. Still, they reinforce that being on an ACE inhibitor matters, without implying that higher doses are better [^467df000] [^cecc2b6c].

> But wait, what if higher doses were started very early after PCI or surgery? Could timing change the risk–benefit balance? The IMAGINE trial in low-risk CABG patients found that early, high-dose quinapril started within 7 days postoperatively increased early MACE, likely via hypotension and reflex neurohormonal activation; while this is not PCI, it underscores that aggressive early RAAS blockade can cause harm in certain post-revascularization settings, reinforcing caution with dose escalation immediately after procedures [^9661ff12].

> Let me consider mechanistic plausibility. Higher ACE inhibitor doses suppress angiotensin II more completely, but they also lower blood pressure and can reduce renal perfusion, which may precipitate hypotension, renal dysfunction, or bradykinin-mediated cough or angioedema. In the absence of outcome data showing incremental benefit from dose escalation after PCI, these adverse effects argue against routine up-titration beyond guideline-supported target doses in stable patients [^notfound].

> I should double-check whether any subgroup or phenotype benefits from higher doses. The PARIS trial specifically enrolled patients with the ACE DD genotype, a group hypothesized to be at higher restenosis risk; even there, high-dose quinapril worsened angiographic outcomes, so there is no clear genotype-directed indication for higher doses after PCI based on current evidence [^a9dc33b3].

> Synthesizing this, I need to ensure my recommendation aligns with guidelines and the totality of evidence. Current guidelines support initiating an ACE inhibitor after PCI in appropriate patients, particularly those with ACS, LV dysfunction, diabetes, or hypertension, but they do not recommend routine dose escalation beyond standard targets. Available randomized and meta-analytic data do not show added clinical benefit from higher doses, and there are credible signals of harm in specific post-procedural contexts, so routine up-titration solely to "maximize benefit" after PCI is not supported [^a1db1417] [^a5a5f6e0] [^6ad5b4c1] [^a9dc33b3] [^9661ff12].

> Practically, I should confirm that patients are on a guideline-directed ACE inhibitor dose, monitor for hypotension, renal function, and cough, and up-titrate only if there is an indication such as heart failure, persistent hypertension, or proteinuric CKD, while avoiding abrupt large dose increases. If ACE inhibitors are not tolerated, ARBs are reasonable alternatives with broadly similar class benefits in appropriate patients [^a1db1417] [^c1253ce1] [^d41e98c7].

> In summary, I should conclude clearly: No, increasing the dose of an ACE inhibitor after PCI does not improve outcomes based on current high-quality evidence and guidelines. Standard-dose ACE inhibitor therapy is recommended for indicated patients after PCI, but routine dose escalation beyond usual targets should be avoided outside of specific indications like heart failure or resistant hypertension, and clinicians should prioritize adherence and tolerability rather than pushing higher doses [^a1db1417] [^a5a5f6e0] [^6ad5b4c1] [^a9dc33b3].

Increasing the dose of ACE inhibitors after PCI **does not reduce restenosis or improve ischemic outcomes** and may increase adverse effects such as hypotension and renal dysfunction [^a9dc33b3] [^372f0fe7]. Current guidelines recommend standard-dose ACE inhibitors for patients with **indications** (e.g. LVEF ≤ 40%, hypertension, diabetes, or CKD) [^a5a5f6e0] [^5236881f], but **do not support routine dose escalation** after PCI. Higher doses are not associated with additional cardiovascular benefit and may cause harm, so dose titration should be individualized based on tolerance and clinical status, not PCI alone [^b6b73a87] [^9661ff12].

---

## Evidence on ACE inhibitor dose and post-PCI outcomes

### Randomized controlled trials

- **PARIS trial**: High-dose quinapril (40 mg/day) started within 48 hours after stenting did not reduce restenosis and was associated with greater late lumen loss than placebo, indicating no benefit and possible harm [^a9dc33b3].

- **IMAGINE trial**: Early high-dose quinapril after CABG increased MACE, suggesting harm with aggressive RAAS blockade early after revascularization [^9661ff12].

- **HOPE and EUROPA**: These trials used standard doses (ramipril 10 mg/day, perindopril 8 mg/day) and showed reduced cardiovascular events, but did not test dose escalation after PCI [^17c75b77].

---

### Observational studies

Observational data show ACE inhibitors after PCI are associated with **lower mortality and MACE**, but **do not demonstrate added benefit from higher doses** [^467df000] [^cecc2b6c]. One study even found higher restenosis with ACE inhibitors, highlighting potential harm in some contexts [^372f0fe7].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

- **ESC 2023**: Recommends ACE inhibitors for ACS patients with LVEF ≤ 40%, hypertension, diabetes, or CKD, but does not endorse routine dose escalation after PCI [^a1db1417] [^8ba0f8b2].

- **ACC/AHA 2025**: Recommends ACE inhibitors for high-risk ACS patients, but does not support routine dose escalation after PCI [^a5a5f6e0] [^6ad5b4c1].

- **ESC 2024**: Recommends ACE inhibitors for very-high-risk chronic coronary syndrome patients, again without supporting dose escalation [^8171e542].

---

## Potential risks of high-dose ACE inhibitors after PCI

Higher ACE inhibitor doses after PCI can cause:

- **Hypotension**: Especially post-PCI, increasing risk of ischemia and renal injury.

- **Renal dysfunction**: Higher risk of AKI, particularly in patients with CKD or contrast exposure.

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Hyperkalemia, particularly with concomitant potassium-sparing drugs or CKD.

- **Cough and angioedema**: More frequent at higher doses, reducing adherence [^notfound].

---

## Clinical scenarios where dose adjustment may be considered

Dose titration may be appropriate for **specific indications**, such as:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Rationale for dose adjustment** |
|-|-|
| Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction | Titrate to target doses proven in trials (e.g. ramipril 10 mg/day) [^17c75b77] |
| Persistent hypertension despite standard therapy | Gradual titration to achieve blood pressure targets [^bd4471f0] |
| Chronic kidney disease with proteinuria | Higher doses may reduce proteinuria, but monitor renal function closely [^12e62746] |

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Study type** | **Findings regarding ace inhibitor dose after pci** |
|-|-|
| Randomized controlled trials | - No benefit from high-dose ACE inhibitors after PCI <br/> - Possible harm (e.g. PARIS, IMAGINE) [^a9dc33b3] [^9661ff12] |
| Observational studies | - Lower mortality with ACE inhibitors after PCI <br/> - No added benefit from higher doses [^467df000] [^cecc2b6c] |
| Clinical guidelines | - Recommend standard-dose ACE inhibitors for indicated patients <br/> - Do not support routine dose escalation after PCI [^a1db1417] [^a5a5f6e0] |

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

- **Routine dose escalation**: Not recommended after PCI due to lack of benefit and potential harm [^a9dc33b3] [^9661ff12].

- **Standard-dose ACE inhibitors**: Recommended for patients with LVEF ≤ 40%, hypertension, diabetes, or CKD [^a5a5f6e0] [^5236881f].

- **Individualized titration**: Consider only for specific indications (e.g. heart failure, resistant hypertension) with close monitoring [^bd4471f0].

- **Monitor for adverse effects**: Watch for hypotension, renal dysfunction, and electrolyte disturbances during titration [^notfound].

---

Increasing ACE inhibitor dose after PCI **does not improve outcomes** and may increase adverse effects. Use standard doses for indicated patients and titrate only for specific reasons with close monitoring.

Objectives

We sought to determine whether the prescription of evidence-based medications at discharge after successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can predict long-term clinical outcome.

Background

The association of standard-of-care drug utilization and long-term mortality and morbidity after PCI is not well studied.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of successful PCI procedures performed on 7,745 patients between March 1, 1998, and December 31, 2004. Discharge medications were analyzed, and a medication score (MEDS) was developed. A MEDS of 1 was assigned for each of the following medication classes: 1) antiplatelet, 2) lipid-lowering, 3) beta-blocker, and 4) angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. The outcomes measured were long-term death, myocardial infarction, and revascularization.

Results

Patients with MEDS of 3 to 4 had higher-risk profiles based upon standard clinical and angiographic criteria. Despite this, at a median follow-up of 36 months, patients with a MEDS of 3 or 4 were at lower risk of death than those with a MEDS of 0 or 1 (8.9%, 7.5%, and 13% for MEDS of 4, 3, and 0 to 1, respectively; p = 0.014). After adjustment for covariates, a MEDS of 3 to 4 was associated with significantly lower mortality or myocardial infarction in follow-up than a MEDS of 0 to 1 (hazard ratios of 0.72 and 0.67 for MEDS of 3 and 4, respectively; p < 0.01). There was no association between MEDS and target vessel revascularization.

Conclusions

After successful PCI, the use of multiple evidence-based classes of cardiovascular medications--antiplatelet, lipid-lowering, beta-blockers, and ACE inhibitors--is associated with improved outcome free of death or MI.

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)–treated ACS antiplatelet strategies—Results from several randomized trials have consistently shown that aspirin withdrawal followed by ticagrelor monotherapy after 1 to 3 months of ticagrelor-based DAPT results in less bleeding without clear excess in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), as compared with continued DAPT among patients with ACS undergoing PCI; although data with clopidogrel have been mixed, concerns have been raised that clopidogrel monotherapy started 1 to 2 months after PCI may increase risk of MACE, and it remains unknown whether this may be explained by excess thrombotic risk in patients displaying inadequate platelet inhibition to clopidogrel, observed in 30% to 40% of patients after PCI; additionally, a randomized trial showed that P2Y12 inhibitor discontinuation followed by aspirin alone after 6 months of DAPT resulted in excess thrombotic risk among ACS patients undergoing PCI (n=2712; 38% ST-elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI]) with similar findings after earlier discontinuation 3 months after PCI; the safety of prasugrel monotherapy has not been established in patients ≥1 month post ACS, and low-dose prasugrel monotherapy (3.75 mg daily) very early after PCI with ACS or at high bleeding risk may increase 30-day MACE compared with DAPT.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes—pretreatment with P2Y12 inhibitors around percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) shows time-dependent evidence and conditional use. In a CURE substudy of patients who underwent PCI (n=2658), pretreatment with clopidogrel (median 6 days) before PCI was associated with a significantly lower rate of MACE both before PCI and by 30 days, and a meta-analysis found that clopidogrel pretreatment significantly reduced the risk for 30-day cardiovascular death or MI. In a randomized trial of prasugrel, pretreatment (median time of only 4.4 hours) did not improve ischemic outcomes but significantly increased bleeding, and it remains unknown whether a benefit exists for administration of ticagrelor prior to PCI in patients with NSTE-ACS. For patients undergoing an early invasive management strategy, routine pretreatment (<24 hours) is not supported by clinical trial data, but it may be reasonable to consider pretreatment with clopidogrel or ticagrelor when angiography is anticipated to be ≥24 hours from administration of the loading dose.

Post–percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) de-escalation in acute coronary syndromes is described as follows: “De-escalation implies modulating DAPT intensity by switching from ticagrelor or prasugrel to clopidogrel.” It “can be guided by the results of platelet function assays that quantify the degree of platelet inhibition among patients treated with clopidogrel,” and “Randomized trials have suggested that unguided de-escalation 1 month after PCI reduces bleeding without incurring ischemic risk as compared with longer term prasugrel- or ticagrelor-based DAPT.” Pooled analyses indicate that de-escalation “yields comparable efficacy to DAPT with respect to ischemic events while reducing bleeding,” although “the benefit of more potent P2Y12 inhibitor therapy extends beyond the early phase post ACS, but with increased bleeding.” The MASTER DAPT trial context includes high-bleeding-risk patients who had “completed a 4-week course of DAPT after successful PCI with drug-eluting stents.”

Methods

Study Design and Population

The PRISM (Personalized Risk Information Services Manager™) study was a prospective study that tested the benefits of providing individualized, evidence‐based estimates of the procedural risks before PCI. 11, 12 Briefly, between 2009 and 2011, consecutive patients undergoing PCI at 10 US hospitals were invited to enroll in this study at the time of their PCI. Because the question of AAM discontinuation is most relevant after nonemergent PCI, we excluded patients who underwent PCI for an ST‐elevation myocardial infarction. Baseline data were collected through a combination of chart review and structured patient interview after the patient underwent PCI and was clinically stable. Medication data on admission and discharge were obtained directly from the medical record. Angiogram reports were used to determine complete revascularization, which was defined as anatomical completeness of revascularization with successful intervention to all significant stenoses in epicardial vessels (defined as coronary stenosis ≥70% in any reported coronary artery vessel or ≥50% in left main artery). A central follow‐up center attempted detailed phone follow‐up on all surviving patients at 6 months post‐PCI. Each participating hospital obtained Institutional Research Board approval, and all patients provided written informed consent for baseline and follow‐up assessments.

Acute coronary syndromes—P2Y12 pretreatment before PCI: In a prospective substudy of CURE, patients who underwent PCI (n=2658) and were pretreated with clopidogrel (median 6 days) had a significantly lower rate of MACE both before PCI and by 30 days, and a meta-analysis found pretreatment with clopidogrel significantly reduced the risk for 30-day cardiovascular death or MI. In contrast, in a randomized trial of prasugrel pretreatment versus administration at the time of PCI, pretreatment (median of only 4.4 hours) did not improve ischemic outcomes, but significantly increased bleeding. For this reason, routine pretreatment in patients undergoing an early invasive management strategy (<24 hours) is not supported by clinical trial data; however, it may be reasonable to consider pretreatment with clopidogrel or ticagrelor when the timing of angiography is anticipated to be ≥24 hours from administration of the loading dose.

### Secondary prevention of ischaemic cardiac events [^837fce9b]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of mortality in resource-rich countries, and is becoming a major cause of morbidity and mortality in resource-poor countries. Secondary prevention in this context is long-term treatment to prevent recurrent cardiac morbidity and mortality in people who have had either a prior acute myocardial infarction (MI) or acute coronary syndrome, or who are at high risk due to severe coronary artery stenoses or prior coronary surgical procedures. Secondary prevention in people with an acute MI or acute coronary syndrome within the past 6 months is not included.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of antithrombotic treatment; other drug treatments; cholesterol reduction; blood pressure reduction; non-drug treatments; and revascularisation procedures? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 137 systematic reviews or RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: advice to eat less fat, advice to eat more fibre, advice to increase consumption of fish oils, amiodarone, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, angiotensin II receptor blockers plus ACE inhibitors, antioxidant vitamin combinations, antiplatelet agents, aspirin, beta-blockers, beta-carotene, blood pressure reduction, calcium channel blockers, cardiac rehabilitation including exercise, class I antiarrhythmic agents, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), fibrates, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), Mediterranean diet, multivitamins, non-specific cholesterol reduction, oral anticoagulants, oral glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), psychosocial treatment, smoking cessation, statins, vitamin C, and vitamin E.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) de-escalation after PCI—definition, guidance tools, and effects: De-escalation implies modulating DAPT intensity by switching from ticagrelor or prasugrel to clopidogrel and can be guided by platelet function assays or inferred by genotyping; trials of guided de-escalation after PCI have shown a lack of benefit, noninferiority, or reductions in minor bleeding versus conventional DAPT; by contrast, unguided de-escalation 1 month after PCI reduces bleeding without incurring ischemic risk compared with longer term prasugrel- or ticagrelor-based DAPT; pooled analyses indicate de-escalation yields comparable efficacy while reducing bleeding, although trials suggest the benefit of more potent P2Y12 inhibitor therapy extends beyond the early phase post ACS with increased bleeding.

### Evidence-based optimal medical therapy and mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction after percutaneous coronary intervention [^467df000]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

ACEI/ARB is recommended in patients with ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction or patients with non–ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction and heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (<40%), diabetes, or chronic kidney disease according to current guidelines. In our study, the prescription rate of ACEIs/ARBs was relatively low, caused by a paucity of evidence and limited indications of the current guidelines.

Recently, several studies have been reported. Prosser et al reported ACEI/ARB use was associated with a significantly lower mortality in patients with AMI (n=21 388) regardless of left ventricular function.Kim et al also demonstrated renin‐angiotensin system inhibitors beyond the first‐year reduced mortality in patients with AMI (n=6236) with preserved left ventricular systolic function (left ventricular ejection fraction ≥50%).In addition, Choi et al showed that an ACEI/ARB was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of a major adverse cardiac event (HR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.63–0.98]; P =0.015) or mortality (HR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.63–0.99]; P =0.041) in patients with CAD after PCI with a DES.Iqbal et al reported that OMT was associated with a significant reduction in adverse clinical outcomes at the 5‐year follow‐up in patients with complex CAD who underwent PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting.In the literature, individual components of OMT in terms of β‐blocker or ACEI/ARB were important for the overall population (for death, β‐blocker: HR, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.36–0.62]; P <0.001; ACEI/ARB: HR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.54–0.91]; P =0.01; for composite end points, β‐blocker: HR, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.49–0.78]; P <0.001; ACEI/ARB: HR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.62–0.96]; P =0.024). Therefore, given this evidence, we think that ACEIs/ARBs also have an independent role for improving clinical outcomes in the AMI population after PCI.

### The impact of De-escalation of antianginal medications on health status after percutaneous coronary intervention [^6cef60b2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Definition of De‐Escalation and Escalation of AAM

For this analysis, we focused on changes in medications between hospital admission and discharge for PCI, given that these changes would be expected to be primarily done empirically (ie, because the patient was revascularized) as opposed to in response to residual symptoms post‐PCI. Medication data, including doses, were collected at admission and discharge post‐PCI. AAMs included beta‐blockers, calcium‐channel blockers, long‐acting nitrate, and ranolazine. AAM de‐escalation/escalation was defined as: (1) being on fewer/more AAMs at discharge versus admission or (2) clinically relevant decrease/increase in AAM doses (if same number of AAMs). Each AAM class of medication was assumed to similarly treat angina, per past literature. 20, 21 To define a clinically relevant change in AAM dose, we determined the maximum recommended dose of each AAM for treating angina (Table S1) and then calculated the patient's % of maximum dose. The % of maximum dose was compared at admission and discharge for each patient, and a >25% absolute decrease/increase in AAM was considered a clinically relevant change (see Table S2 for examples). As a sensitivity analysis, we also used a 50% absolute decrease/increase as a cut‐off point for % maximum change. Further sensitivity analyses by PCI indication (stable coronary artery disease, unstable angina, non‐ST‐elevation myocardial infarction, and other indications) were performed. Results were qualitatively similar, and thus only the main analyses are shown.

P2Y12 inhibitor discontinuation or prasugrel monotherapy—after 6 months of DAPT, discontinuing the P2Y12 inhibitor and continuing aspirin alone resulted in excess thrombotic risk among ACS patients undergoing PCI (n=2712; 38% STEMI), with similar findings when discontinuation occurred 3 months after PCI; the safety of prasugrel monotherapy has not been established in patients ≥1 month post ACS, and low-dose prasugrel monotherapy (3.75 mg daily) in Japanese patients very early after PCI with ACS or at high bleeding risk may increase 30-day MACE compared with DAPT.

Table 7—dosing considerations for oral antiplatelet therapy in acute coronary syndromes (ACS) summarizes agent- and dose-specific details as follows: Aspirin lists “Loading dose 162-325 mg orally” with nonenteric-coated tablets chewed when possible and “Maintenance dose 75–100 mg orally daily (nonenteric coated),” with a loading dose also for those already on aspirin. Clopidogrel lists “Loading dose 300 or 600 mg orally” and “Maintenance 75 mg orally daily”; for STEMI with fibrinolytic, dosing is “Loading dose 300 mg orally if age ≤75 y; Initial dose 75 mg orally if age >75 y,” followed by “Maintenance 75 mg orally daily.” Prasugrel for patients “undergoing PCI” provides “Loading dose 60 mg orally,” “Maintenance dose 10 mg orally daily if body weight ≥60 kg and age <75 y,” or “Maintenance dose 5 mg orally daily if body weight <60 kg or age ≥75 y (use caution).” Ticagrelor lists “Loading dose 180 mg orally” and “Maintenance dose 90 mg orally twice daily.”

Acute coronary syndromes—Evidence on parenteral anticoagulants and periprocedural considerations includes the following: in unstable angina, a meta-analysis including 1353 patients from 6 randomized studies found a lower, albeit nonstatistically significant, risk with aspirin plus heparin during the randomized treatment period (relative risk, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.44-1.02]); in high-risk NSTE-ACS, about 40% underwent PCI and fondaparinux increased guiding-catheter thrombosis versus enoxaparin (0.9% versus 0.3%); across 12 171 ACS patients without ST-segment elevation in 5 randomized trials, low-molecular-weight heparin versus UFH showed no significant difference in death or MI (2.2% versus 2.3%); for patients undergoing coronary revascularization, parenteral anticoagulation is indicated until revascularization, and premature discontinuation is associated with the greatest risk for reinfarction in the first 8 to 48 hours; UFH has traditionally been the preferred anticoagulant to support PCI with activated clotting time used to guide dosing; bivalirudin can support PCI and in BRIGHT-4 used a bolus 0.75 mg/kg then 1.75 mg/kg per hour with a post-PCI infusion 1.75 mg/kg per hour for 2 to 4 hours, and bivalirudin with the full dose post-PCI infusion was superior to UFH in reducing a 30-day composite outcome.

Dose increase in case of aspirin

Although there is no dedicated RCT that has evaluated the clinical relevance of increased dose of aspirin based on platelet reactivity testing, findings from a large RCT comparing low-dose and high-dose aspirin in patients with ACS without platelet function testing suggest no benefit for using high doses (>100 mg) of aspirin. The Randomized Trial of Optimal Clopidogrel and Aspirin Dosing in Patients with ACS Undergoing an Early Invasive Strategy with Intent For PCI (CURRENT OASIS-7 trial) compared low-dose (75–100 mg) and high-dose (300–325 mg) aspirin in 25 087 patients with ACS and found no difference in the 30-day risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke in both the overall ACS population(HR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.85–1.08, P = 0.47) and in the subgroup of patients who underwent PCI(HR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.84–1.13, P = 0.76). There was a higher rate of gastrointestinal bleeding in the high-dose aspirin group (0.24 vs. 0.38%, P = 0.051).Similarly, higher risk of bleeding with high-dose aspirin was observed in the post hoc analysis of the Harmonizing Outcomes With Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction (HORIZONS-AMI) Trial. Post hoc analysis of the PLATelet inhibition and patient Outcomes (PLATO) trial, prompted by regional differences between North America and other countries in the primary endpoint of the trial, suggested a possible interaction between ticagrelor and high-dose aspirin. After extensive statistical modelling, investigators suggested that the use of high-dose aspirin might explain the trend for an increased risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke in patients randomized to ticagrelor, whereas others treated with low-dose aspirin and ticagrelor had a significant benefit over clopidogrel. However, since this interaction lacks—so far—any biological explanation and comes from a post hoc, non-pre-specified analysis, it should be interpreted cautiously.

### Effect of ACE inhibitors on angiographic restenosis after coronary stenting (PARIS): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^a9dc33b3]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background

The DD genotype for the angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE I) deletion allele (D) polymorphism is a possible genetic risk factor for restenosis after coronary stent implantation. We aimed to establish whether or not blockade of ACE with high doses of ACE inhibitors could reduce this risk of angiographic restenosis.

Methods

We characterised the ACE I/D polymorphism in 345 consecutive patients who were undergoing coronary stenting. 115 had the DD genotype. We assigned 91 of these 115 patients to quinapril 40 mg daily (n=46) or placebo (n=45). Treatment was started within 48 h after stent implantation and continued for 6 months. 79 patients complied with the protocol and underwent follow-up angiography after 6 months.

Findings

Our primary endpoint of late loss in minimum lumen diameter (a quantitative index of restenosis) was significantly higher in the quinapril group than in the controls (mean 1.11 mm [SD 0.70] vs 0.76 mm [0.60]; p=0.018). Secondary endpoints also showed consistent trends towards increased angiographic restenosis in the treatment group.

Interpretation

Contrary to our expectations, ACE inhibitor treatment did not reduce restenosis after coronary stent implantation in patients with DD genotype, but was associated with an exaggerated restenotic process when compared with administration of placebo.

### Multifaceted intervention to improve P2Y12 inhibitor adherence after percutaneous coronary intervention: a stepped wedge Trial [^18da50d1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

In the MI FREEE study, there was a decrease in total major vascular events or revascularization in the full drug coverage arm, with an improvement of 4% to 6% in adherence to statins, β‐blockers, and/or angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker medications. In the current study, the findings were mixed on clinical events. There was a reduction in MI, stroke, or death but an increase in repeated PCI. Of the repeated PCIs in the intervention group, 62% were elective procedures. With the intervention, patients were contacted by a clinical team member if they did not refill their P2Y12 medication. It is possible that these additional clinical contacts led to greater surveillance of anginal symptoms and the subsequent clinical cascade leading to repeated PCI. Prior studies of home telemonitoring for patients with heart failure have demonstrated similar mixed results, with reductions in mortality but increases in emergency department visits.Regardless of the clinical outcomes, it should be emphasized that P2Y12 inhibitors are recommended by clinical practice guidelines and performance measures.

### Adjunctive pharmacotherapy before percutaneous coronary intervention in non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes: the role of modulating inflammation [^f3951fab]. Circulation (2003). Low credibility.

Vascular inflammation is central to the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and the response to vascular injury after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). For both ACS and PCI, the magnitude of vascular inflammation is linked to adverse late clinical outcomes (e.g., death, recurrent myocardial infarction [MI] or ischemia, and restenosis). Many pharmacologic therapies with demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of ACS have anti-inflammatory properties, which are distinct from their perceived primary mechanism of action. The anti-inflammatory effects of aspirin, clopidogrel, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors, statins, and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are reviewed, and the hypothesis is generated that modulation of vascular inflammation at least in part contributes a common basis for the long-term clinical benefit ascribed to these medications. A therapeutic algorithm based on clinical risk stratification and coronary revascularization strategy is proposed for incorporating the current American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guideline recommendations for treatment of patients who present with non-ST-elevation ACS.

### Prasugrel dose De-escalation therapy after complex percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with acute coronary syndrome: a post hoc analysis from the HOST-REDUCE-POLYTECH-ACS trial [^d86b51cc]. JAMA Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Importance

De-escalation of dual-antiplatelet therapy through dose reduction of prasugrel improved net adverse clinical events after acute coronary syndrome (ACS), mainly through the reduction of bleeding without an increase in ischemic outcomes. However, whether such benefits are similarly observed in those receiving complex procedures is unknown.

Objective

To investigate whether the benefits of prasugrel dose de-escalation therapy are maintained in the complex percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) subgroup.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a post hoc analysis of the HOST-REDUCE-POLYTECH-ACS trial, a randomized, open-label, adjudicator-blinded, multicenter trial performed at 35 hospitals in South Korea. Study participants included patients with ACS who were receiving PCI. Data were collected from September 30, 2014, to December 18, 2015, and analyzed from September 17, 2020, to June 15, 2021.

Interventions and Exposures

Patients were randomized to a prasugrel dose de-escalation (5 mg daily) at 1 month post-PCI group or a conventional (10 mg daily) group. Complex PCI was defined as having at least 1 of the following features: 3 or more stents implanted, 3 or more lesions treated, bifurcation PCI, total stent length 60 mm or larger, left main PCI, or heavy calcification.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main analysis end points were MACE (major adverse cardiac event, a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, and repeat revascularization) at 1 year for ischemic outcomes, and BARC (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium) class 2 or higher bleeding events at 1 year for bleeding outcomes.

Results

Of 2271 patients (mean [SD] age, 58.9 [9.0] years; 2024 [89%] male patients) for whom full procedural data were available, 705 patients received complex PCI, and 1566 patients received noncomplex PCI. Complex PCI was associated with higher rates of ischemic outcomes but not with bleeding outcomes. Prasugrel dose de-escalation did not increase the risk of MACE (hazard ratio [HR], 0.88; 95% CI, 0.47-1.66; P=.70 in complex PCI; HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.45-1.46; P=.48 in noncomplex PCI; P for interaction=.84) but decreased BARC class 2 or higher bleeding events (HR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.10-0.61; P=.002 in complex PCI; HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.38-1.00; P=.05 in noncomplex PCI; P for interaction=.08), albeit with wide 95% CIs.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this post hoc analysis of patients with ACS, prasugrel dose de-escalation compared with conventional therapy was not associated with an increased risk of ischemic outcomes but may reduce the risk of minor bleeding events at 1 year, irrespective of PCI complexity.

Table 7—dosing considerations for oral antiplatelet therapy in acute coronary syndromes (ACS) lists the following: Aspirin—loading dose 162-325 mg orally; aspirin (nonenteric coated) should be chewed, when possible, to achieve faster onset of antiplatelet action, and a loading dose should be administered for patients already on aspirin therapy; maintenance dose 75-100 mg orally daily. Clopidogrel—NSTE-ACS or STEMI without fibrinolytic: loading dose 300 or 600 mg orally with maintenance 75 mg orally daily; STEMI with fibrinolytic: loading dose 300 mg orally if age ≤75 y or initial dose 75 mg orally if age >75 y, with maintenance 75 mg orally daily. Prasugrel—NSTE-ACS or STEMI without fibrinolytic and undergoing PCI: loading dose 60 mg orally; maintenance dose 10 mg orally daily if body weight ≥60 kg and age <75 y, or 5 mg orally daily if body weight <60 kg or age ≥75 y (use caution). Ticagrelor—NSTE-ACS or STEMI without fibrinolytic: loading dose 180 mg orally; maintenance dose 90 mg orally twice daily.

### Long-term effects of quinapril with high affinity for tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme after coronary intervention in Japanese [^578a0ea7]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown experimentally to prevent restenosis after balloon injury. We previously reported that quinapril reduced the 6-month restenosis (percent diameter stenosis >or=50%) rate after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, it was not established whether this favorable outcome was maintained for longer periods.

Methods

This study was a prospective, randomized, open, and non-placebo controlled trial. Patients with coronary artery disease were enrolled after successful coronary balloon angioplasty or stenting. Two hundred and fifty-three patients were randomly assigned to the quinapril (10-20 mg per day) or control groups. The major clinical end points included death, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, or revascularization (either coronary artery bypass grafting or repeat PCI). These were tabulated according to the intention-to-treat principle.

Results

Long-term follow-up was available with a median of 4.8 (interquartile range 4.2-5.1) years after the procedure. The incidence of combined end points of mortality and morbidity (myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accident) in the quinapril group was lower than that in the control group (6.1% vs 14.8%; relative risk [RR] 0.42, 95% CI 0.18-0.96, P =.033). The overall incidence of end-point events in patients with quinapril also occurred less frequently (29.8% vs 46.7%; RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.38-0.86, P =.007).

Conclusions

These clinical outcomes show that the benefit of quinapril in patients following PCI is maintained for 4 years.

### Β-blocker therapy after myocardial infarction: a little goes a long way [^65be5334]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

The optimal dosing of BBL therapy after MI in the contemporary era is another unanswered question. The dosing of BBL was not collected in the Cardiovascular Risk and Identification of Potential High‐Risk Population in Acute Myocardial Infarction registry, and the interaction of dose and duration on outcomes after MI is unknown. The only contemporary randomized controlled trial of BBL versus placebo that investigated outcomes past 3 years was in a selected group of patients with MI, those with STEMI undergoing primary PCI who had normal ejection fraction. In the study, 801 patients were enrolled and the BBL was carvedilol. The intended dose titration was to 20 mg/d; however, dosing was at the discretion of the physician and averaged only 6.3 mg/d at 1 year. The trial failed to show a benefit of BBL on the primary outcome, which was a composite of all‐cause death, MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and acute coronary syndrome.Although the low dose of BBLs may have influenced the potential therapeutic effect, several national registries suggest that patients after MI are treated with BBL doses well below the target range of earlier randomized trials.,In addition, several nonrandomized studies supported the use of BBL over no BBL but failed to demonstrate a greater effect of high‐ compared with low‐dose therapy, with low dose defined as either <25% or 50% of the target dose, depending on the study. In the OBTAIN registry, in fact, the lowest mortality was found with 25% of the target dose.

Circling back to the optimal duration of BBL therapy after MI, this rigorously adjusted analysis adds evidence that maintenance therapy beyond 36 months is associated with lower mortality. A review of landmark analyses from large national registries evaluating benefits of long‐term use of BBLs after acute MI, however, shows conflicting results, with several showing no difference in mortality or composite outcomes (Table).So, how can the results be so divergent? Although these observational trials provide a window into real‐world practices and outcomes, differences in patient populations, BBL cardioselectivity and dosing, analytic techniques, and unmeasured confounders exist. Ultimately, evidence from ongoing adequately powered randomized trials is required to make definitive recommendations.

### Evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use diminishes the need for coronary revascularization after stenting [^5d3c4103]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Restenosis after stenting, in contrast to balloon angioplasty, is predominantly due to neointima formation. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors diminish neointima formation in animal models of arterial injury. In an observational study, 1,598 patients who were treated from 1994 to 1997 with coronary stents and prospectively followed for clinical events were divided into 2 groups: those receiving ACE inhibitors at the time of stenting (n = 345) and those who did not (n = 1,253). Multivariate logistic regression was used to adjust for imbalances between populations with regard to elements relevant to risk of 12-month coronary revascularization, which was the primary study end point. After adjustment, ACE inhibitor usage remained significantly protective against revascularization (odds ratio [OR] 0.46, 95% confidence interval 0.29 to 0.73, p = 0.001). Protection was not observed in patients treated with balloon angioplasty alone during the same period (OR 1.06, p = 0.33), which is consistent with the results of prior randomized trials. ACE inhibitors appear to decrease late revascularization, possibly due to a reduction in restenosis after coronary stenting.

### Β-blocker use following myocardial infarction: low prevalence of evidence-based dosing [^bd01bb17]. American Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Quality improvement programs have shown increased use of beta-blockers post-myocardial infarction (MI), but there are no data on whether appropriate doses are administered.

Methods

In a prospective registry that enrolled consecutive patients with MI, we evaluated beta-blocker dosing at discharge after MI and 3 weeks later and assessed clinical predictors for treatment with very low doses. We studied 1,971 patients (70.8% male) with a mean age of 63.9 +/- 13.7 years, of whom 48.2% had an ST-elevation MI.

Results

beta-Blocker utilization rates following MI were 93.2% at discharge: 20.1% received <25% of target dose, 36.5% received 25% of target dose, 26.4% received 26% to 50% of target dose, and 17.0% received >50% of target dose. Between discharge and 3 weeks, 76.4% had no change in beta-blocker dose, with 11.9% and 11.6% having their dose reduced and increased, respectively. Absence of hypertension, acute percutaneous coronary intervention, older age, and no angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy were consistent predictors of treatment with very low beta-blocker doses.

Conclusions

Underdosing of beta-blockers is highly prevalent among patients post-MI. This represents an important opportunity in quality improvement for the care of patients who have suffered an MI.

### Perioperative use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac surgery [^9661ff12]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

In the early 2000’s, the QUO VAIDS trialand APRES trialreported that in patients undergoing CABG or percutaneous coronary intervention, quinapril, or ramipril, given before or immediately after coronary revascularization for a long-term (>1 year) can decrease MACE including MI, recurrence of angina pectoris, ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, clinical heart failure, or need for revascularization. Those two trials were randomized, although had small sample size (n = 149 or 159, respectively).

In 2008, the IMAGINE trial(n = 2553) tested whether early initiation (7 days after CABG) of an ACE inhibitor reduced cardiovascular events in stable patients with left ventricular ejection fraction 40%. The trial showed that quinapril (40 mg/day, started ≤ 7 days after surgery) did not improve clinical outcomes including cardiovascular events and death up to 3 years after the surgery in low-risk CABG patients. Instead, quinapril, given postoperatively, increased MACE including cardiovascular death, cardiac arrest, nonfatal MI, coronary revascularization, stroke, and unstable angina or heart failure required hospitalization in the early postoperative period (HR 1.52, 95% CI 1.03–2.26, P = 0.0356). The results of the IMAGINE trial suggested that ACE inhibitors may cause harm to patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The study has its strength of randomization. Nonetheless, this study may have some limitations such as the inclusion of only “low-risk” patients undergoing CABG, starting quinapril acutely in the postoperative period, and possible excessive doses, as a significantly higher incidence of hypotension was found in the patients receiving quinapril (12%) vs. those receiving placebo (5.5%, p < 0.001).

ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) after fibrinolysis—rescue percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and routine early angiography are supported by the following: The REACT trial enrolled 427 patients with failed reperfusion at 90 minutes after fibrinolysis to 1 of 3 treatment arms, including rescue PCI, conservative care, or repeat fibrinolytic therapy, and Rescue PCI significantly reduced the composite primary end-point of death, reinfarction, stroke, or severe HF at 6 months compared with either conservative care or repeat fibrinolytic therapy. Meta-analyses also support lower rates of death or reinfarction when rescue PCI is performed in this setting, though Minor and major bleeding and rates of stroke were significantly higher with rescue PCI; practice changes note The use of radial artery access and the elimination of the routine use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors has reduced bleeding. For routine early angiography after fibrinolysis, the text states it reduces MACE in comparison to usual care (delayed coronary angiography and/or an ischemia-guided strategy of revascularization), that In these studies, ≥80% of patients who were transferred underwent PCI, and that a pharmaco-invasive strategy defined as an interval between lysis and PCI ≥2 hours was associated with a 21% reduction in the mortality rate when compared with a strategy of fibrinolysis alone; although earlier studies reported increased bleeding with very early catheterization (mean time, 2.2 hours), more contemporary data suggest similar rates of bleeding even if cardiac catheterization is performed very early after fibrinolytic therapy.

### Impact of previous percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and / or stenting revascularization on outcomes after surgical revascularization: insights from the imagine study [^24f30d11]. European Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Aim

To determine the impact of previous coronary artery revascularization by percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and/or stenting (PCI) on outcome after subsequent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

Methods and Results

The ischaemia management with Accupril post-bypass Graft via Inhibition of the coNverting Enzyme (IMAGINE) trial, conducted between November 1999 and September 2004, tested whether early initiation of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor post-CABG, in stable patients with LVEF >or=40%, would reduce cardiovascular events. Of the 2489 patients included in the IMAGINE trial, undergoing their first operation, 430 had a history of PCI prior to surgery (PCI group), and 2059 were referred to surgery without previous PCI (non-PCI group). There was a significant increase in the primary IMAGINE endpoint in the PCI group, HR = 1.53 [1.17-1.98], P = 0.0016. Coronary revascularization, HR = 1.80 [1.13-2.87], P = 0.014, unstable angina requiring hospitalization, HR = 2.43 [1.52-3.89], P = 0.0002, were the two individual components that significantly increased in the PCI group, even when adjusted for baseline characteristics (age, sex, history of myocardial infarction or stroke, diabetes, treatment group, or off-pump surgery).

Conclusion

Patients with left ventricular ejection fraction >or=40% having a history of PCI prior to surgery had a worse outcome post-CABG than those with no prior PCI. Further studies are needed to investigate whether these results apply for drug eluting stents.

### Clopidogrel [^08a42dda]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 4: Outcome Events in the CURE Primary Analysis

Most of the benefit of clopidogrel occurred in the first two months, but the difference from placebo was maintained throughout the course of the trial (up to 12 months) (see Figure 2).

Figure 2: Cardiovascular Death, Myocardial Infarction, and Stroke in the CURE Study

The effect of clopidogrel did not differ significantly in various subgroups, as shown in Figure 3. The benefits associated with clopidogrel were independent of the use of other acute and long-term cardiovascular therapies, including heparin/LMWH, intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) inhibitors, lipid-lowering drugs, beta-blockers, and ACE-inhibitors. The efficacy of clopidogrel was observed independently of the dose of aspirin (75 mg to 325 mg once daily). The use of oral anticoagulants, non-study antiplatelet drugs, and chronic NSAIDs was not allowed in CURE.

Figure 3: Hazard Ratio for Patient Baseline Characteristics and On-Study Concomitant Medications/Interventions for the CURE Study

Figure 3: Hazard Ratio for Patient Baseline Characteristics and On-Study Concomitant Medications/Interventions for the CURE Study (continued)

The use of clopidogrel in CURE was associated with a decrease in the use of thrombolytic therapy (71 patients [1.1%] in the clopidogrel group, 126 patients [2.0%] in the placebo group; relative risk reduction of 43%), and GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors (369 patients [5.9%] in the clopidogrel group, 454 patients [7.2%] in the placebo group, relative risk reduction of 18%). The use of clopidogrel in CURE did not affect the number of patients treated with CABG or PCI (with or without stenting) (2253 patients [36.0%] in the clopidogrel group, 2324 patients [36.9%] in the placebo group; relative risk reduction of 4.0%).

Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) post–percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) antiplatelet strategy—first 12 months postdischarge: The default strategy is DAPT ≥12 mo, and class-labeled options are shown for bleeding reduction and high bleeding risk. For patients needing oral anticoagulant (OAC), triple therapy (DAPT + OAC) is used initially, with instructions to discontinue aspirin 1-4 wk post PCI, then continue SAPT + OAC (clopidogrel monotherapy and OAC) (Class 1). A bleeding-reduction path allows early aspirin withdrawal with discontinue aspirin 1-3 mo post PCI followed by SAPT (ticagrelor monotherapy) (Class 1). Deescalation options include deescalate potency of P2Y12 inhibitor > 1 mo post PCI and DAPT (aspirin + clopidogrel) (Class 2b). In high bleeding risk post PCI, begin with DAPT (aspirin + P2Y12 inhibitor), then stop aspirin or P2Y12 inhibitor 1 mo post PCI and continue SAPT (aspirin or P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy) (Class 2b). Abbreviations are defined on-page: DAPT (dual antiplatelet therapy), SAPT (single antiplatelet therapy), and OAC (oral anticoagulant).

### Effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on restenosis after coronary stenting [^372f0fe7]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

The Plasma level of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) has been identified as a major risk factor for restenosis after coronary stent implantation in selected patients; ACE inhibition may therefore contribute to prevent its occurrence. The effect of oral ACE inhibition at conventional doses was analyzed retrospectively in a series of 897 patients with ischemia who received >or=1 coronary stent on 998 lesions and underwent angiographic follow-up; no exclusion criteria were introduced in this analysis. The restenosis rate in 282 patients (31.4%) taking ACE inhibitors was 36.6% compared with 22.9% in 615 non-ACE-inhibited patients (p = 0.00001, odds ratio [OR] 1.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.45 to 2.59), and the late loss in minimum lumen diameter was 1.25 +/- 0.8 versus 0.96 +/- 0.8 mm, respectively (p = 0.0001). During univariate analysis, a negative effect of the drug on restenosis was observed in all subgroups of patients (i.e., hypertensives, diabetics, women, and patients with previous myocardial infarction). Similar effects were observed independently of the ACE gene insertion/deletion polymorphism. During multivariate analysis, ACE inhibition was confirmed as an independent risk factor for restenosis (OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.35 to 2.51, p = 0.0001). Other predictors were the implantation of multiple stents (OR 2.41, 95% CI 1.60 to 3.64, p <0.0001), diabetes (OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.61 to 3.41, p <0.0001), and vessel reference diameter before angioplasty (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.69, p <0.0001). Although unexplained and apparently contradictory, our data suggest that the use of conventional oral doses of ACE inhibitors in a "real-world" population who underwent coronary stent implantation increases the incidence of in-stent restenosis. Such a finding does not negate the known clinical benefits of ACE inhibitors, but it may deserve attention when a patient treated with ACE inhibitors becomes a candidate for stent implantation.

Importance

Loading doses of atorvastatin did not show reduction on clinical outcomes in the overall population of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) enrolled in the Statins Evaluation in Coronary Procedures and Revascularization (SECURE-PCI) trial, but a potential benefit was identified in patients who subsequently underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Objectives

To determine whether periprocedural loading doses of atorvastatin are associated with decreased 30-day major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with ACS undergoing PCI according to type of ACS and timing of atorvastatin administration before PCI.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Secondary analysis of a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial conducted at 53 sites that enrolled 4191 patients with ACS intended to be treated with PCI between April 18, 2012, and October 06, 2017.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to 2 loading doses of 80 mg of atorvastatin or matching placebo before and 24 hours after a planned PCI. By protocol, all patients (regardless of treatment group) received 40 mg of atorvastatin for 30 days starting 24 hours after the second dose of study medication.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was MACE through 30 days, composed by all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, and unplanned coronary revascularization. Cox regression models adjusting for key baseline characteristics were used to assess the association between atorvastatin and MACE in patients undergoing PCI.

Results

From the overall trial population, 2710 (64.7%) underwent PCI (650 women [24.0%]; mean [SD] age, 62 [11.3] years). Loading atorvastatin was associated with reduced MACE at 30 days by 28% in the PCI group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.72; 95% CI 0.54-0.97; P=.03). Loading dose of atorvastatin was administered less than 12 hours before PCI in 2548 patients (95.3%) (45.1%<2 hours and 54.3% between 2 and 12 hours). There was no significant interaction between treatment effect and timing of study drug administration. The treatment effect of loading atorvastatin was more pronounced in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction than in patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS (adjusted HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.38-0.92; P=.02; HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.58-1.27; P=.43, respectively).

Conclusions and Relevance

In patients with ACS undergoing PCI, periprocedural loading doses of atorvastatin appeared to reduce the rate of MACE at 30 days, most clearly in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. This beneficial effect seemed to be preserved and consistent, irrespective of the timing of atorvastatin administration, including within 2 hours before PCI.

### 2025 ACC / AHA / ACEP / NAEMSP / SCAI guideline for the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^2361fe67]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Aspirin for ACS—recommendation and dosing: In patients with ACS, an initial oral loading dose of aspirin, followed by daily low-dose aspirin, is recommended to reduce death and MACE (COR I; LOE A). Aspirin should be initiated with a loading dose (162-325 mg) as soon as possible on presentation irrespective of management strategy and followed by maintenance therapy, with current evidence supporting uncoated low-dose aspirin (75-100 mg) for daily maintenance; among patients referred for an invasive strategy, continued full-dose aspirin (300-325 mg daily) for 30 days after a loading dose was not superior to low-dose aspirin (75-100 mg daily) for reduction of MACE and was associated with increased minor and gastrointestinal bleeding; for patients unable to take oral medication, rectal or intravenous administration are options.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

ACC/AHA acute coronary syndromes (ACS)—parenteral anticoagulation dosing is specified as follows: Unfractionated heparin (UFH) initial therapy uses loading dose 60 IU/kg (max 4000 IU) with initial infusion 12 IU/kg per h (max 1000 IU/h) adjusted to therapeutic activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) range of 60-80 s; to support percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), in patients without prior anticoagulant therapy give 70-100 IU/kg with initial bolus to achieve target activated clotting time (ACT) of 250-300 s; with fibrinolytic therapy, use loading dose 60 IU/kg (maximum 4000 IU) with initial infusion 12 IU/kg per h (maximum 1000 IU/h) adjusted to therapeutic aPTT range, with therapeutic aPTT range in setting of fibrinolytic therapy 50-70 s. Bivalirudin to support PCI is 0.75 mg/kg bolus, 1.75 mg/kg per h IV infusion during the PCI procedure, with post-PCI infusion 1.75 mg/kg per h for 2-4 h post-PCI; in patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) <30 mL/min, reduced infusion to 1 mg/kg per h. Enoxaparin initial therapy is 1 mg/kg subcutaneous every 12 h, reduced to 1 mg/kg per d subcutaneous if CrCl <30 mL/min; to support PCI, if the last subcutaneous dose was administered 8-12 h earlier or only 1 dose has been given, an IV dose of 0.3 mg/kg should be given, if the last dose was within 8 h no additional enoxaparin should be given, and for patients without prior anticoagulant therapy give 0.5-0.75 mg/kg IV bolus; with fibrinolytic therapy, if age ≤75 y give 30 mg IV bolus followed in 15 min by 1 mg/kg subcutaneous every 12 h (maximum 100 mg for the first 2 doses), if age ≥75 y give no bolus and use 0.75 mg/kg subcutaneous every 12 h (maximum 75 mg for the first 2 doses), and regardless of age, if CrCl <30 mL/min give 1 mg/kg subcutaneous every 24 h. Fondaparinux initial therapy is 2.5 mg subcutaneous daily; with fibrinolytic therapy give 2.5 mg IV then 2.5 mg subcutaneous daily starting the following day, contraindicated if CrCl <30 mL/min, and fondaparinux should not be used to support PCI because of the risk of catheter thrombosis.

### Effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers after coronary artery bypass graft surgery: a population-based cohort study [^6aff5f0a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

This was a large, population‐based cohort study that examined objective, clinically meaningful outcomes. However, it has limitations that warrant discussion. There are unknown biases and confounding that are associated with all observational studies, though they were minimized by using probability‐weighting, which is the most effective method to strengthen inferences of causality. Because the cohort consisted exclusively of patients from BC, Canada, the results may be less generalizable to patients in jurisdictions with different demographics and/or health care systems. The quality of the data was contingent on accurate coding, and any inaccuracies or misclassifications in the databases could have potentially introduced bias. The assessment of adherence via PDC, which is a standard method for evaluating adherence using administrative data, assumes that patients are actually taking their medications as dispensed. Patients who received an ACEI/ARB while in the hospital, but were not continued postdischarge, were not captured in this study. Our propensity‐weighting models were limited to the covariates contained in population‐level administrative databases, which may have omitted important clinical variables that could have strengthened our analyses. The absence of race and ethnicity variables are examples. The definition of heart failure, as coded in the databases, did not differentiate between reduced versus mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction; however, because all patients in the cohort had pre‐existing CAD that required surgical revascularization, presumably most patients with heart failure had a reduced ejection fraction, which aligns with the benefit observed with ACEI/ARBs in landmark clinical trials.,This study included a variety of different ACEI/ARBs (predominantly ramipril), but did not evaluate the effect of ACEIs versus ARBs, a dose–response relationship, or specific target doses. Furthermore, because ≈96% of the cohort was prescribed an ACEI, it was not possible to compare outcomes between patients exposed to ACEIs and ARBs due to sample size reasons. Finally, the effect sizes observed were larger than anticipated for a preventive therapy of this type. One obvious possible explanation is residual confounding, an influence that was expected to have been minimized by using probability weighting. Yet, the potential for unmeasured factors associated with both the exposure and outcome, and which contributed to the large hazard reduction, exist. An adequately powered randomized controlled trial would confirm these findings. Further research could evaluate the effect of ACEIs, as compared with ARBs, on MACE in patients who undergo CABG surgery.

### High-dose versus low-dose angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in heart failure: systematic review and meta-analysis [^b6b73a87]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Study selection and data extraction

First, we deleted duplicates and screened titles and abstracts from the search results. Studies clearly not meeting the inclusion criteria were excluded. Then, the full text of selected references was assessed, and studies meeting the prespecified eligibility criteria were included in the review.

We then extracted relevant data from the selected studies using predesigned tables. Extracted data included methodological characteristics of the studies and outcomes of interest. The authors of the selected studies were contacted by email if full data were not available. We used each study’s classification of high-dose or low-dose ACEI. When needed, data were extracted from figures or graphs using WebPlotDigitizer.If the study did not report the SD, we estimated it from the p value or used the SD provided for the same outcome in other treatment groups in the same study.

All steps of study selection and data extraction were conducted by two independent reviewers. Disagreements regarding study selection and data extraction were resolved through consensus or by a third reviewer.

Risk of bias and quality assessment

Two independent reviewers critically appraised the included studies using RoB 2.0.The overall quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework.Discrepancies in quality assessment were resolved through consensus or by a third reviewer.

### Patient-tailored antithrombotic therapy following percutaneous coronary intervention [^6c2e2f06]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Low-dose factor Xa inhibitor on top of antiplatelet therapy

Factor Xa inhibitors and other anticoagulants ultimately inhibit the formation or activation of thrombin, which plays a crucial role in both coagulation and platelet activation and may offer a synergistic benefit when added to antiplatelet therapy.A strong asset of dual-pathway inhibition is that anticoagulants, like factor Xa-inhibitors, modulate a number of inflammatory pathways which may reduce their contribution to atherogenesis.Oral anticoagulants have been shown to mitigate the risk of arterial thrombotic events, but because DAPT was superior to aspirin and warfarin in preventing stent thrombosis, the latter strategy was abandoned in favour of DAPT following PCI.However, recently reported studies investigating (low-dose) non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (Supplementary material online, Table S4) have renewed interest in combining lower anticoagulant doses with antiplatelet therapy.

In the placebo-controlled ATLAS ACS 2-TIMI 51 trial, low-dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) reduced the incidence of cardiovascular death, MI, and stroke in ACS patients mostly treated with aspirin and clopidogrel, at the expense of increased bleeding.Subsequently, in the COMPASS trial, low-dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) on top of aspirin as compared to aspirin alone was associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular death, MI or stroke in patients with CCS and peripheral artery disease at moderate-high risk of ischaemic events.In high-risk subgroups (e.g. patients with diabetes, moderate chronic kidney disease, and current smokers), low-dose rivaroxaban was associated with even greater absolute risk reductions. Unfortunately, pre-specified significance thresholds for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality were not met and patients on low-dose rivaroxaban on top of aspirin had more major (though not-fatal) bleeding events.Interestingly, low-dose rivaroxaban and aspirin as compared to aspirin alone significantly reduced the rate of stroke by 42% (driven by a 49% relative reduction in ischaemic stroke partially offset by a numeric increase in haemorrhagic stroke), making low-dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin an important new option for stroke prevention in patients with atherosclerosis.

### A comparison between statin with ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy in STEMI patients who underwent successful PCI with drug-eluting stents [^fac5d6e4]. Atherosclerosis (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Studies of the comparative clinical outcomes between statin with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients are limited. We compared 2-year clinical outcomes between statin with ACEI or ARB therapy in STEMI patients after successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents (DES).

Methods

A total of 11,706 STEMI patients were enrolled and separated into two groups: the ACEI group (statin + ACEI, n = 8705) and the ARB group (statin + ARB, n = 3001). The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiac events (MACE) defined as all-cause death, recurrent MI (re-MI), and any coronary revascularization. Secondary endpoints were the individual components of MACE and target vessel failure (TVF).

Results

After propensity score-matched (PSM) analysis, two PSM groups (2729 pairs, n = 5458, C-statistic = 0.675) were generated. The cumulative incidences of MACE, re-MI, and any coronary revascularization were similar between the two groups. However, the cumulative incidences of all-cause death (hazard ratio [HR], 1.548; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.091-2.197; p = 0.014) and cardiac death (HR, 1.850; 95% CI, 1.218-2.811; p = 0.004) were significantly higher in the ARB group compared with the ACEI group after PSM analysis.

Conclusions

The combination of statin with ACEI may be the preferred treatment strategy to reduce mortality rates in STEMI patients after successful PCI with DES rather than statin with ARB in this study during a 2-year follow-up period.

### Prognostically relevant periprocedural myocardial injury and infarction associated with percutaneous coronary interventions: a consensus document of the ESC working group on cellular biology of the heart and European association of percutaneous cardiovascular interventions (EAPCI) [^f8fbde14]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Consensus recommendations

Baseline (pre-PCI) cTn values: Baseline (pre-PCI) cTn values should be measured, whenever possible, in all CCS patients undergoing PCI, as knowledge of this information is essential to correctly interpret post-PCI elevations in cTn values,,,, and to diagnose major periprocedural myocardial injury and type 4a MI following PCI (Figure 3 ; Graphical abstract).
Post-PCI cTn values: Post-PCI cTn values should be measured, whenever possible, at 3–6 h post-procedure, and if the values are rising, further sampling may be considered at 12–24 h post-procedure in all CCS patients undergoing PCI. For those with concurrent ECG, imaging or angiographic evidence of new myocardial ischaemia, the diagnosis of type 4a MI may apply (Figure 3).For those without concurrent ECG, imaging or angiographic evidence of new myocardial ischaemia, the diagnosis of major periprocedural myocardial injury may apply (Figure 3).
Type 4a MI: In CCS patients with normal baseline (pre-PCI) cTn values (≤1× 99th percentile URL) or elevated but stable baseline cTn values undergoing PCI who experience a type 4a MI, pharmacotherapy should be optimized to reduce risk of future MACE as recommended in current ESC revascularization and CCS guidelines. Whether CCS patients with type 4a MI, who are not already on ACE-inhibitors (for heart failure, hypertension, or diabetes) or beta-blockers (for left ventricular dysfunction or systolic heart failure), would benefit from the addition of these drugs for reducing the risk of future MACE is not known, and needs to be evaluated in time to come studies. As type 4a MI is a strong independent predictor of all-cause mortality at 1 year post-PCI, its incidence may be used as a quality metric and surrogate endpoint for clinical trials.
Major periprocedural myocardial injury: In CCS patients with normal baseline cTn values (≤1× 99th percentile URL) or elevated but stable baseline cTn values undergoing PCI who experience prognostically relevant major periprocedural myocardial injury, defined as post-PCI cTn elevation >5× 99th percentile URL (in the absence of ECG, angiographic, and imaging evidence of new myocardial ischaemia) within 48 h of PCI,pharmacotherapy should be optimized to reduce risk of future MACE as recommended in current ESC revascularization and CCS guidelines. Whether CCS patients with prognostically relevant major periprocedural myocardial injury, who are not already on ACE-inhibitors (for heart failure, hypertension, or diabetes) or beta-blockers (for left ventricular dysfunction or systolic heart failure), would benefit from the addition of beta-blockers or ACE-inhibitors to reduce the risk of future MACE is not known, and needs to be further evaluated. As major periprocedural myocardial injury is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality at 1 year,its incidence may be used as a quality metric and surrogate endpoint for clinical trials (Figure 3).
‘Minor’ periprocedural myocardial injury: Chronic coronary syndrome patients with normal baseline cTn values (≤1× 99th percentile URL) undergoing PCI who experience ‘minor’ periprocedural myocardial injury, defined as post-PCI cTn elevation of >1× 99th percentile URL but ≤5× 99th percentile URL (Figure 3),pharmacotherapy should be optimized to reduce risk of future MACE as recommended in current ESC revascularization and CCS guidelines.
Future clinical studies and meta-analyses evaluating the prognostic relevance of post-PCI elevations in cTn should only include CCS patients with normal baseline (pre-PCI) cTn values (≤1× 99th percentile URL), and should adjust for known patient features, lesion characteristics, and periprocedural factors, which have been shown to be independent predictors of periprocedural myocardial injury, type 4a MI, and MACE (Table 2).

Recommendation-specific supportive text for lipid therapy after acute coronary syndromes (ACS): High-intensity statin regimens lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration by an average of ≥50%, and there is no indication of safety concerns from very low LDL-C levels; therefore, high-intensity statin therapy should not be de-escalated following in-patient hospitalization in patients who are tolerating treatment. In IMPROVE IT, addition of ezetimibe to simvastatin 40 mg daily in patients ≤10 days after ACS led to a modest but significant reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) over a median follow-up of 6 years. Clinical trials of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors have demonstrated a 15% relative risk reduction in MACE over a median of 2 to 3 years including patients >1 month after ACS.

In-hospital management of ACS—monitoring and antiplatelet loading considerations include that the optimal duration of telemetry monitoring with contemporary management is unclear, and the increasingly rapid triage and timing of invasive risk stratification calls into question the value of preloading of oral P2Y12 inhibitors (defined as administering the loading dose prior to coronary angiography), with clinical trials of preloading not showing a compelling benefit when coronary angiography occurs rapidly after the patient’s clinical presentation.

### Use of medications for secondary prevention after coronary bypass surgery compared with percutaneous coronary intervention [^6e50c801]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to compare use of evidence-based secondary preventive medications after coronary bypass surgery (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Background

Use of cardioprotective medication after coronary revascularization has been inconsistent and relatively low in older studies.

Methods

We studied patients in a large integrated healthcare delivery system who underwent CABG or PCI for new onset coronary disease. We used data from health plan databases about prescriptions dispensed during the first year after initial coronary revascularization to identify patients who never filled a prescription and to calculate the medication possession ratio among patients who filled at least 1 prescription. We focused on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers, and statins.

Results

Between 2000 and 2007, 8,837 patients with new onset coronary disease underwent initial CABG, and 14,516 underwent initial PCI. Patients receiving CABG were more likely than patients receiving PCI to not fill a prescription for a statin (7.1% vs. 4.8%, p < 0.0001) or for an ACEI/ARB (29.1% vs. 22.4%, p < 0.0001), but similar proportions never filled a prescription for a beta-blocker (6.4% vs. 6.1%). Among those who filled at least 1 prescription post-revascularization, patients receiving CABG had lower medication possession ratios than patients receiving PCI for ACEI/ARBs (69.4% vs. 77.8%, p < 0.0001), beta-blockers (76.1% vs. 80.6%, p < 0.0001), and statins (82.7% vs. 84.2%, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Patients who received CABG were generally less likely than patients who received PCI to fill prescriptions for secondary preventive medications and to use those medications consistently in the first year after the procedure.

### Beyond medication prescription as performance measures: optimal secondary prevention medication dosing after acute myocardial infarction [^97de4885]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to examine the prescribing patterns of medications quantified by the performance measures for acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

Background

Current performance measures for AMI are designed to improve quality by quantifying the use of evidence-based treatments. However, these measures only assess medication prescription. Whether patients receive optimal dosing of secondary prevention medications at the time of and after discharge after AMI is unknown.

Methods

We assessed treatment doses of beta-blockers, statins, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI)/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) at discharge and 12 months after AMI among 6,748 patients from 31 hospitals enrolled in 2 U.S. registries (2003 to 2008). Prescribed doses were categorized as none, low (<50% target [defined from seminal clinical trials]), moderate (50% to 74% target), or goal (≥ 75% target). Patients with contraindications were excluded from analyses for that medication.

Results

Most eligible patients (>87%) were prescribed some dose of each medication at discharge, although only 1 in 3 patients were prescribed these medications at goal doses. Of patients not discharged on goal doses, up-titration during follow-up occurred infrequently (approximately 25% of patients for each medication). At 12 months, goal doses of beta-blockers, statins, and ACEI/ARBs were achieved in only 12%, 26%, and 32% of eligible patients, respectively. After multivariable adjustment, prescription of goal dose at discharge was strongly associated with being at goal dose at follow-up: beta-blockers, adjusted odds ratio (OR): 6.08 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.70 to 10.01); statins, adjusted OR: 8.22 (95% CI: 6.20 to 10.90); ACEI/ARBs, adjusted OR: 5.80 (95% CI: 2.56 to 13.16); p < 0.001 for each.

Conclusions

Although nearly all patients after an AMI are discharged on appropriate secondary prevention medications, dose increases occur infrequently, and most patients are prescribed doses below those with proven efficacy in clinical trials. Integration of dose intensity into performance measures might help improve the use of optimal medical therapy after AMI.

### Medical management after coronary stent implantation: a review [^a43cc02b]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stents is currently the most commonly performed coronary revascularization procedure; hence, optimizing post-PCI outcomes is important for all physicians treating such patients.

Objective

To review the contemporary literature on optimal medical therapy after PCI.

Evidence Review

We performed a comprehensive search of the PubMed and Cochrane Library databases for manuscripts on medical therapy after PCI, published between 2000 and February 2013. Bibliographies of the retrieved studies were searched by hand for other relevant studies. Priority was given to data from large randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. Of the 6852 publications retrieved, 91 were included.

Findings

Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor (eg, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor) reduces the risk of stent thrombosis and subsequent cardiovascular events post-PCI (number needed to treat, 33-53) and is the current standard of care. Aspirin should be continued indefinitely and low dose (75-100 mg daily) is preferred over higher doses. A P2Y12 inhibitor should be administered for 12 months after PCI, unless the patient is at high risk for bleeding; however, ongoing studies are assessing the value of shorter or longer duration of P2Y12 inhibitor administration. In patients with acute coronary syndromes, prasugrel and ticagrelor further reduce cardiovascular ischemic events compared with clopidogrel but are associated with higher bleeding risk. If possible, noncardiac surgery should be delayed until 12 months after coronary stenting. Patients receiving coronary stents who require warfarin are at high risk for bleeding if they also receive dual antiplatelet therapy. Omission of aspirin may be advantageous in such patients. Routine platelet function or genetic testing is currently not recommended to tailor antiplatelet therapy after PCI.

Conclusions and Relevance

Dual antiplatelet therapy remains the cornerstone of medical therapy after PCI. Continuous advances in pharmacotherapy can further enhance our capacity to improve outcomes in this high-risk patient group.

### Improved short and long term survival associated with percutaneous coronary intervention in the elderly patients with acute coronary syndrome [^4c87238e]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are increasingly used in daily clinical practice in elderly patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) despite limited evidence. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of PCI on short and long term survivals in a large cohort of elderly patients with ACS from a "real world".

Methods

We enrolled 491 patients aged ≥70 years admitted to our institution with ACS from 2006 to 2012. Effect of PCI on short and long term survival was evaluated in both overall and a propensity score-matched cohort.

Results

The mean age of the overall cohort is 83±6 years. Among them, 285 were treated with PCI, whereas 206 were not. Patients treated with PCI were younger (82±5 vs. 85±6), more males (67% vs. 46%), with lower heart rate (77±22 vs. 84±21), higher eGFR (58±20 vs. 47±23), and less with heart failure (29% vs. 15%) (all p<0.001). In both overall and propensity-matched population, improved survival was associated with PCI-treatment at 1 and 3 years (p<0.001 for all comparisons). Furthermore, by using multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression model following factors were identified as independent predictors of 3-year all-cause mortality: age (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.00-1.16), heart rate (HR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03), eGFR (HR 3.07, 95% CI 1.63-5.77), malignancy (HR 2.03, 95% CI 1.27-4.57), prior CABG (HR 2.033, 95% CI 1.27-4.57), medication with statin (HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.19-0.86) in PCI group, whereas age (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.03-1.13), heart rate (HR 1.01, 95% CI 1.01-1.02), hypertension (HR 1.87, 95% CI 1.01-3.49) and using of ACEI/ARB (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.28-0.76) in non-PCI group.

Conclusions

In elderly ACS patients, PCI-treatment was associated with improved 1 and 3-year survival and PCI-treated patients had different prognostic profile compared to those without PCI treatment.

### Dual renin-angiotensin system inhibition for prevention of renal and cardiovascular events: do the latest trials challenge existing evidence? [^12e62746]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

Adapted from Farsang 2011.

All three classes of available RAS inhibitors (ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs] and direct renin inhibitors [DRIs]) interrupt the normal angiotensin II feedback suppression of renin secretion from the kidneys. In the past two decades, landmark trials have shown that early aggressive lowering of BP and inhibition of the RAS improves outcomes for patients with renal disease or CVD [-]. ACE inhibitors and ARBs reduce proteinuria, slow progression of CKD and lower morbidity and mortality rates in patients at high CVD risk, and in patients already displaying evidence of target organ damage (TOD) such as myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), stable coronary heart disease (CHD) with or without left ventricular dysfunction (LVD), and reduce mortality and reinfarction rates in patients with LVD or HF after MI [-]. Evidence from large outcome trials such as the ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET ®) suggests that ARBs like telmisartan have additional CV benefits beyond BP lowering. Outcomes with ARB monotherapy in post-MI patients are similar to those achieved with high doses of an ACE inhibitor. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are widely acknowledged to confer additional renoprotective benefits beyond the effects of BP control alone (Table 1). ARBs are also known to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), however, only telmisartan exhibits increased PPAR-γ activity at therapeutic dosages. PPAR-γ enhances insulin sensitivity, has positive effects on lipid metabolism, endothelium, oxidative stress and vascular inflammation, and its anti-inflammatory, antiatherogenic and antihypertensive effects are considered to exert CV protective effects. Initial data suggest that, as with ARBs and ACE inhibitors, aliskiren, an oral DRI, may protect against TOD [-].

### Early and sustained dual oral antiplatelet therapy following percutaneous coronary intervention: a randomized controlled trial [^7a0e2201]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Context

Following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), short-term clopidogrel therapy in addition to aspirin leads to greater protection from thrombotic complications than aspirin alone. However, the optimal duration of combination oral antiplatelet therapy is unknown. Also, although current clinical data suggest a benefit for beginning therapy with a clopidogrel loading dose prior to PCI, the practical application of this therapy has not been prospectively studied.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefit of long-term (12-month) treatment with clopidogrel after PCI and to determine the benefit of initiating clopidogrel with a preprocedure loading dose, both in addition to aspirin therapy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The Clopidogrel for the Reduction of Events During Observation (CREDO) trial, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted among 2116 patients who were to undergo elective PCI or were deemed at high likelihood of undergoing PCI, enrolled at 99 centers in North America from June 1999 through April 2001.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to receive a 300-mg clopidogrel loading dose (n = 1053) or placebo (n = 1063) 3 to 24 hours before PCI. Thereafter, all patients received clopidogrel, 75 mg/d, through day 28. From day 29 through 12 months, patients in the loading-dose group received clopidogrel, 75 mg/d, and those in the control group received placebo. Both groups received aspirin throughout the study.

Main Outcome Measures

One-year incidence of the composite of death, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke in the intent-to-treat population; 28-day incidence of the composite of death, MI, or urgent target vessel revascularization in the per-protocol population.

Results

At 1 year, long-term clopidogrel therapy was associated with a 26.9% relative reduction in the combined risk of death, MI, or stroke (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.9%-44.4%; P =.02; absolute reduction, 3%). Clopidogrel pretreatment did not significantly reduce the combined risk of death, MI, or urgent target vessel revascularization at 28 days (reduction, 18.5%; 95% CI, -14.2% to 41.8%; P =.23). However, in a prespecified subgroup analysis, patients who received clopidogrel at least 6 hours before PCI experienced a relative risk reduction of 38.6% (95% CI, -1.6% to 62.9%; P =.051) for this end point compared with no reduction with treatment less than 6 hours before PCI. Risk of major bleeding at 1 year increased, but not significantly (8.8% with clopidogrel vs 6.7% with placebo; P =.07).

Conclusions

Following PCI, long-term (1-year) clopidogrel therapy significantly reduced the risk of adverse ischemic events. A loading dose of clopidogrel given at least 3 hours before the procedure did not reduce events at 28 days, but subgroup analyses suggest that longer intervals between the loading dose and PCI may reduce events.

Characteristics of the index AMI included type of AMI (subendocardial or transmural), procedures (coronary artery bypass surgery, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty/stent, cardiac catheterization, angiocardiography, and infusion of platelet inhibitors), and complications (cardiogenic shock, cardiac dysrhythmias, hypotension, acute renal failure, and heart failure). Additionally, length of the index hospitalization, admission to an intensive care unit and/or coronary care unit, and consultation from a cardiologist were measured.

Outpatient follow‐up with a cardiologist and/or primary care provider was measured in the 30 days after hospital discharge. 5 Hospitalizations for AMI and stroke were also measured from the index discharge date for 6 months. Use of secondary prevention medications during this same 6‐month period was also assessed, including measures for ACE inhibitors/angiotensinreceptor blockers, β‐blockers, P2Y 12 inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and aldosterone receptor antagonists (having at least 1 prescription claim for the medication class during the index AMI hospital stay or within 180 days after discharge). Finally, change in the simvastatin‐equivalent average daily dose was calculated (6‐month post‐AMI average daily dose minus 6‐month pre‐AMI average daily dose). 5

Statistical Analyses

Distributions of patient characteristics were described. Additionally, the distribution of changes in statin adherence—stratified by pre‐AMI statin adherence—was described. All multivariable analyses (survival curves and Cox proportional hazards models) assessing the association between change in statin adherence and all‐cause mortality were adjusted for all variables described in the Patient Characteristics section above; multivariable analyses assessing the association between post‐AMI statin adherence and all‐cause mortality were adjusted for these same variables, as well as pre‐AMI statin adherence.

To visualize the association of statin adherence and all‐cause mortality after an AMI hospitalization in a familiar way, direct adjusted survival curves 8 for the outcome of all‐cause mortality were plotted, stratified by post‐AMI statin adherence (3 curves). To show the importance of changes in statin adherence on this association, another set of direct adjusted survival curves was plotted, stratified by change in statin adherence from pre‐ to post‐AMI (9 curves). The adjusted survival probabilities with 95% CIs at 1‐year of follow‐up were also estimated for both sets of survival curves.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Evidence gaps—initial evaluation and management: Although the 2025 ACS guideline recognizes the value of risk scores in estimating the risk of death or recurrent MI, limited prospective randomized data are available as to whether risk scores should be used to determine treatment strategies. The highest risk patients are those who present after a cardiac arrest, and although the data support an invasive approach in resuscitated patients with ST-segment elevation on the postarrest ECG, any potential benefit of coronary angiography may be attenuated in those who are comatose. It is also less clear whether reperfusion with either fibrinolysis or primary PCI provides clinical benefit in ST-segment elevation patients who present late after symptom onset (12 to 48 hours) but who are no longer symptomatic.

### Angiotensin receptor blocker in patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction with preserved left ventricular systolic function: prospective cohort study [^c1253ce1]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are beneficial and strongly recommended in patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with heart failure or left ventricular systolic dysfunction.ACE inhibitors can also be useful in STEMI patients with preserved left ventricular systolic function.Up to 20% of patients, however, cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors because of adverse reactions such as the development of cough and angio-oedema.Angiotensin receptor blockers could be an alternative to ACE inhibitors in STEMI patients with heart failure or left ventricular systolic dysfunction, particularly those who are intolerant to ACE inhibitors.No data are available, however, on the role of angiotensin receptor blocker in patients with STEMI and preserved left ventricular systolic function. Additionally, current guidelines do not cover the use of angiotensin receptor blocker in low risk patients with STEMI. As angiotensin receptor blockers are equivalent to ACE inhibitors in patients who have vascular disease or high risk diabetes but do not have heart failure,they could be beneficial in STEMI patients with preserved left ventricular systolic function. We sought to investigate the association between treatment with an angiotensin receptor blocker at discharge and clinical outcomes in STEMI patients with preserved left ventricular systolic function after primary percutaneous coronary intervention. We used data from a nationwide large scale registry dedicated to myocardial infarction.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with coronary artery disease and absence of heart failure or left ventricular systolic dysfunction (...) [^17c75b77]. JAMA Network (2006). Excellent credibility.

Five ACE inhibitors were tested, and 2 of the trials3, 4 used doses higher than those usually necessary for antihypertensive therapy. The study populations ranged from 460 to 12 218 patients, and the duration of follow-up ranged from 2 to 5 years. Significant reductions in acute MI with ACE inhibitor therapy were found in both HOPE and EUROPA. 3, 4 Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition seemed to have had no effect on the MI rate in PEACE, 5 and nonsignificant reductions were observed in the other trials. 10 -13 Overall, there was an 18% reduction in MI with ACE inhibitor therapy. Five trials3 -5, 11, 13 analyzed the occurrence of hospitalization because of congestive heart failure and showed a reduction in this end point in patients receiving ACE inhibitors. The reduction was significant in EUROPA4 and PEACE. 5 Overall, the risk was reduced by 23%.

Therefore, the 2 trials with definitely positive results used the highest doses. The clinical situation in which the therapeutic target is controlling the atherothrombotic process is different from that of heart failure, in which the level of activation of the renin-angiotensin system is such that even rather low doses of ACE inhibitors are effective. There is evidence that only the larger doses of ACE inhibitors can slow the progression of atherosclerotic disease. In SECURE, 63 2 doses of ramipril that yielded similar reductions in blood pressure were tested against placebo; only the 10-mg dose was associated with significant slowing of carotid atherosclerosis progression.

In this overview of randomized trials of ACE inhibitors for the long-term secondary prevention of CAD in patients without LV dysfunction or heart failure, active treatment was associated with a highly significant reduction in all-cause mortality and all major cardiovascular events. These results, along with those previously reported in patients who have CAD with LV dysfunction or heart failure, suggest that ACE inhibitor therapy should be systematically used in all patients with documented CAD and that continued efforts should be made to implement current secondary prevention guidelines.

Acute coronary syndromes—supportive evidence for high-intensity statins: High-intensity statin regimens lower LDL-C concentration by an average of ≥50%, and compared with moderate-intensity statins they reduce major vascular events by approximately 15% in patients with coronary artery disease; the benefit of a high-intensity statin regimen appears early after ACS and persists over time, and no indication was observed of any safety concerns from achieving very low LDL-C concentrations on statins or other lipid-lowering therapies; therefore, high-intensity statin therapy should not be de-escalated during follow-up in patients who are tolerating treatment.

Guidelines and hospital protocols should emphasize the importance of documenting patient history, which could affect NSTEMI diagnosis, and of regularly assessing the risks and benefits of therapies to suit the patient's clinical status, which may change over time. 54 Furthermore, guidelines and protocols should include guidance on how to manage patients with dyspnea because some physicians are concerned about dyspnea related to ticagrelor use in their patients, given that dyspnea is more frequently reported in patients with ACS prescribed ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel. 73, 74 The incidence of dyspnea in a real‐world setting has been shown to be greater than that reported in clinical trials and may lead to higher rates of ticagrelor discontinuation. 74 However, given that there is evidence to suggest that dyspnea can resolve during inhibitor use, only in the case of persistent ticagrelor‐related dyspnea should drug discontinuation be considered. 73

### A randomized controlled trial of a physiology-guided percutaneous coronary intervention optimization strategy: rationale and design of the TARGET FFR study [^bb5e9263]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The proposed target for an “optimal” post‐PCI FFR result stems from a meta‐analysis which included several early studies that assessed post‐PCI FFR using relatively small bolus doses of intracoronary adenosine to induce hyperemia. Smaller doses of adenosine may not have achieved maximal hyperemia and could potentially have overestimated the final FFR results. As such, a post‐PCI FFR value of ≥0.90 may not be realistic target, particularly in the left anterior descending artery which typically subtends a larger myocardial mass. It has in fact been suggested that optimal cutoff values of post‐PCI FFR are different according to the target vessels involved. 46 Consequently, the PIOS intervention may not be effective at increasing the FFR value to such an extent, or at least, not in the proportions desired.

4.1 Limitations

There are potential concerns regarding both performance and confirmation bias with this trial design and as such the following steps were taken to minimize their effects.

By its very nature, the PIOS group potentially receives more focused attention from the interventionalist than the control group. Despite the operator's best efforts, this does not necessarily translate into higher final FFR values (the primary endpoint), however, and that is the question the trial seeks to answer—does routinely applying a post‐PCI physiology‐guided optimization strategy actually achieve a clinically meaningful difference in the proportion of patients with optimal final FFR results?

Following PCI procedures, the treating interventionalists reassured all patients that they received the highest standard of care, regardless of their randomization group. Specific results of the final physiology measurements were not disclosed to patients in either group.

In an effort to mitigate the potential Hawthorne (“observer”) effect, the study could have on local PCI practices, other than cases randomized to the PIOS intervention where post‐PCI FFR was <0.90, operators were blinded to all post‐PCI physiology results, 15 different interventional cardiologists were enlisted to participate in the trial in order to: (a) assess a wider variety of practice and (b) dilute the exposure any one physician had to unblinded post‐PCI physiology results (on average each operator would have performed less than 10 unblinded PIOS cases over a 20‐month period). Further details on blinding procedures are contained in the Supplementary Appendix.

Furthermore, we posit that rather than being subject to confirmation bias, the primary results of the trial will actually challenge such bias regarding the functional results of PCI procedures.

### The effect of metformin on cardiovascular risk profile in patients without diabetes presenting with acute myocardial infarction: data from the glycometabolic intervention as adjunct to primary coronary intervention in ST elevation myocardial infarction (GIPS-III) trial [^3728f98f]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

After ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), secondary prevention therapies as recommended by current guidelines such as β-blockers, ACE inhibitors, platelet aggregation inhibitors (acetylsalicylic acid and others), and lipid-lowering drugs all have been proven to reduce mortality and attenuate cardiovascular risk profile.In addition to the targeted substrates by current therapies, such as blood pressure, neuroendocrine activation, and increased thrombogenicity, glycometabolic dysregulation is strongly associated with adverse outcome after STEMI.Impaired fasting glucose and insulin resistance is associated with impaired prognosis, even at levels of dysglycemia not yet diagnostic of diabetes mellitus.Dysglycemia is common in patients with STEMI—as much as one in every four patients have undiagnosed diabetes and up to one in every two patients has prediabetes.Although glycometabolic dysregulation is both common and strongly associated with adverse outcomes after STEMI, it nonetheless is not a target of current pharmacotherapy.

Metformin is an effective glucose-lowering biguanide and currently the most widely used oral antihyperglycemic agent.Metformin has been shown to improve cardiovascular outcome, with a benefit that exceeds the benefit that may be expected solely by blood glucose lowering.In patients with diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease, metformin was associated with reduced all-cause mortality compared with other antihyperglycemic strategies.Long-term metformin treatment in patients at risk for or with diabetes improved cardiovascular risk profile mediated by weight loss, improved insulin resistance, reduction of the metabolic syndrome, and by lowering total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.Further, in patients at risk for diabetes, but without cardiovascular disease, metformin reduced diabetes development with 30–40%.

We aimed to evaluate if metformin treatment, on top of standard care, would improve cardiovascular risk in patients without diabetes. We therefore conducted this prespecified subanalysis in the ‘Metabolic Modulation With Metformin to Reduce Heart Failure After Acute Myocardial Infarction: Glycometabolic Intervention as adjunct to Primary Coronary Intervention in ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (GIPS-III)’ study, that enrolled patients without diabetes who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for STEMI.

### Angiotensin receptor blocker in patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction with preserved left ventricular systolic function: prospective cohort study [^d41e98c7]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

Use of angiotensin receptor blocker therapy at discharge was associated with improved rates of cardiac death or myocardial infarction in STEMI patients with preserved or slightly reduced left ventricular systolic function compared with the results obtained in patients receiving no renin angiotensin system blocker. Moreover, use of angiotensin receptor blockers at discharge resulted in clinical outcomes comparable with those obtained with the use of ACE inhibitors. Our results suggest that angiotensin receptor blockers are as beneficial as ACE inhibitors in STEMI patients with preserved left ventricular systolic function after primary percutaneous coronary intervention.

Sensitivity Analyses

Results for MACE were similar to the primary analyses when stratified by a history of heart failure at both 1 and 5 years (Table 6). Assigning a PDC of 100% for patients with only 1 prescription fill significantly increased risk of MACE in patients without heart failure at 1 year (HR, 3.03 [95% CI, 1.50–6.14]), but not for patients with heart failure, and there was no significant effect in patients with or without heart failure at 5years. For PDC analyzed as a continuous variable, there was no effect at 1 year in patients with or without heart failure per 1% increase in PDC. At 5 years, there was no effect in patients with heart failure, but a higher PDC was associated with a decreased hazard of MACE (HR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.53–0.86] per 1% increase in PDC) in patients without heart failure. Assuming 0% versus 100% PDC during hospitalizations, as well as using 30‐day versus 90‐day windows to calculate PDC, was associated with a lower hazard of MACE in patients without heart failure, but not patients with heart failure, over 5 years of follow‐up. PDC thresholds of 60%, 70%, and 90% were associated with a reduced hazard of MACE in patients without heart failure, but not patients with heart failure, at 5 years (Table 7).

Coronary artery reperfusion may use either percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or fibrinolytic therapy; where acute PCI is readily available with expert prompt intervention (within 90 minutes of first medical contact) it provides superior results versus fibrinolysis. When acute PCI is not available, fibrinolysis should be used as the initial treatment strategy (within 12 hours of symptom onset) if contraindications do not exist, including history of intracranial hemorrhage, closed head or facial trauma, or ischemic stroke within the past 3 months; uncontrolled hypertension; bleeding diathesis; or aortic dissection. For acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina or non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction), medical management including aspirin, heparin, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, β-blockers, and ACE inhibition are indicated, usually along with coronary angiography and PCI. Evidence to guide treatment in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is sparse; despite high risk, those with CKD are less likely to receive reperfusion or other recommended therapies, but when recommended therapies have been given to people with CKD, risk of death was decreased in observational studies; data for the subset with both diabetes and CKD do not exist.

### Adverse events after stopping clopidogrel in post-acute coronary syndrome patients: insights from a large integrated healthcare delivery system [^ce0d7d24]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2010). Low credibility.

Background

A prior study from the Veterans Health Administration found a clustering of cardiovascular events after clopidogrel cessation. We sought to confirm and expand these findings.

Methods and Results

This was a retrospective cohort study of 2017 patients with acute coronary syndrome discharged on clopidogrel from an integrated health care delivery system. Rates of all-cause mortality or acute myocardial infarction (MI) within 1 year after stopping clopidogrel were assessed among patients who did not have an event before stopping clopidogrel. Death/MI occurred in 4.3% (n=71) of patients. The rates of death/MI were 3.07, 1.62, 0.70, and 0.95 per 10 000 patient-days for the time intervals of 0 to 90, 91 to 180, 181 to 270, and 271 to 360 days after stopping clopidogrel. In multivariable analysis, the 0- to 90-day interval after stopping clopidogrel was associated with higher risk of death/MI (incidence rate ratio, 2.74; 95% confidence interval, 1.69 to 4.44) compared with 91- to 360-day interval. There was a similar trend of increased events after stopping clopidogrel for various subgroups (women versus men, medical therapy versus percutaneous coronary intervention, stent type, and > or =6 months or <6 months of clopidogrel treatment). Among patients taking clopidogrel but stopping ACE inhibitor medications, the event rates were similar in the 0- to 90-day versus the 91- to 360-day interval (2.67 versus 2.91 per 10 000 patient-days; P=0.91).

Conclusions

We observed a clustering of adverse events in the 0 to 90 days after stopping clopidogrel. This clustering of events was not present among patients stopping ACE inhibitors. These findings are consistent with a possible rebound platelet hyper-reactivity after stopping clopidogrel and additional platelet studies are needed to confirm this effect.

### Outcome comparison of 600-and 300-mg loading doses of clopidogrel in patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: results from the ARMYDA-6 MI (antiplatelet therapy for reduction of MYocardial damage during angioplasty-myocardial infarction) randomized study [^a7d9f91d]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to compare 600- and 300-mg clopidogrel loading doses in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

Background

Given the high thrombotic risk of patients with STEMI, greater platelet inhibition may improve outcome in those patients receiving percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Although observational data suggest that pretreatment with a 600-mg clopidogrel loading dose may be more effective than the 300-mg regimen in primary PCI, this hypothesis has never been tested in a randomized study.

Methods

A total of 201 patients undergoing primary PCI for STEMI randomly received a 600-mg (n = 103) or 300-mg (n = 98) clopidogrel loading dose before the procedure. The primary endpoint was the evaluation of the infarct size, defined as the area under the curve of cardiac markers.

Results

Infarct size was significantly lower in the high-dose regimen: median creatine kinase-myocardial band 2,070 ng/ml (interquartile range [IQR]: 815 to 2,847 ng/ml) versus 3,049 ng/ml (IQR: 1,050 to 7,031 ng/ml) in the 300-mg group, p = 0.0001; troponin-I 255 ng/ml (IQR: 130 to 461 ng/ml) versus 380 ng/ml (IQR: 134 to 1,406 ng/ml), p < 0.0001. In the 600-mg arm, Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow grade <3 after PCI was less frequent (5.8% vs. 16.3%, p = 0.031), left ventricular ejection fraction at discharge was improved (52.1 ± 9.5% vs. 48.8 ± 11.3%, p = 0.026), 30-day major adverse cardiovascular events were fewer (5.8% vs. 15%, p = 0.049), and bleeding/entry site complications were not increased (secondary endpoints).

Conclusions

In STEMI patients, pre-treatment with a 600-mg clopidogrel loading dose before primary PCI was associated with a reduction of the infarct size compared with a 300-mg loading dose, as well as with improvement of angiographic results, residual cardiac function, and 30-day major adverse cardiovascular events; further studies are warranted to evaluate impact of such strategy on survival.

### Optimal timing for the initiation of pre-treatment with 300 mg clopidogrel before percutaneous coronary intervention [^f0cd65d1]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to determine the optimal timing of a 300-mg clopidogrel loading dose before percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients enrolled in the Clopidogrel for the Reduction of Events During Observation (CREDO) trial.

Background

A loading dose of clopidogrel before a PCI has become relatively commonplace, although the data supporting this practice are limited and sometimes conflicting.

Methods

Patients were randomized to receive either 300 mg clopidogrel or a matching placebo administered a minimum of 3 h and a maximum of 24 h before PCI. The primary 28-day combined end point was death, myocardial infarction, or urgent target vessel revascularization. Linear splines were used to summarize the effect of the time of pre-treatment as a continuous variable.

Results

A total of 1,762 patients were evaluated. For patients randomized to placebo, there was no relationship between the duration of pre-treatment and the occurrence of the primary end point, whereas longer durations of pre-treatment in patients randomized to clopidogrel were associated with improved outcomes. The event rates diverged maximally at 24 h. The difference in outcomes between placebo and clopidogrel pre-treated patients was not significant until > or =15 h pre-treatment, with a 58.8% (p = 0.028) reduction in the primary end point in patients pre-treated with clopidogrel > or =15 h compared with placebo.

Conclusions

When a 300-mg loading dose of clopidogrel is used, little benefit is obtained compared with just 75 mg at the time of the PCI when the treatment duration is <12 h. In patients pre-treated for longer durations, the optimal duration seems to approach 24 h.

### Apixaban dose in patients with atrial Fibrillation and acute coronary syndrome and / or undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: insights from AUGUSTUS [^f8a3d747]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Approximately half of those with atrial fibrillation (AF) have accompanying coronary artery disease, and roughly 10% will require percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).Patients with AF who have had an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are at a higher risk of adverse outcomes, including mortality, than patients without AF. It can be challenging to identify an antithrombotic regimen for patients with AF and ACS that takes into consideration both bleeding and ischemic events. Antithrombotic therapy in these patients usually includes an oral anticoagulant, which can be either a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) (ie, warfarin) or a direct oral anticoagulant, and dual antiplatelet therapy consisting of aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor.

Often, a combination of a direct oral anticoagulant and dual antiplatelet therapy (ie, triple therapy) is used in patients with AF and ACS. Triple therapy is associated with a high rate of significant bleeding compared with dual or single antithrombotic therapy.Antiplatelet and anticoagulation management in patients with AF and a recent ACS and/or undergoing PCI was assessed in AUGUSTUS (An Open-Label, Prospective, Multicenter, 2×2 Factorial, Randomized Controlled, Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety of Apixaban vs VKA and Aspirin vs Aspirin Placebo in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation and Acute Coronary Syndrome or Percutaneous Coronary Intervention). Results from AUGUSTUS demonstrated that bleeding and death or hospitalization were significantly lower, without substantial increases in ischemic outcomes, with a regimen including apixaban without aspirin than with regimens including VKA, aspirin, or both.

Previous studies have demonstrated that a reduced dose of apixaban of 2.5 mg twice daily is safe and efficacious in patients with AF and ≥2 of the following criteria: age ≥80 years, body weight ≤60 kg, and serum creatinine ≥1.5 mg/dL (133 μmol/L). However, there are no data regarding the use of reduced vs standard dose apixaban in patients with AF and a recent ACS and/or PCI or in other clinical settings in which triple therapy is indicated. In this post hoc analysis of the AUGUSTUS trial, we determined the number of patients who received reduced dose apixaban and the proportion who met the specified dose-reduction criteria. We then assessed the outcomes of patients who appropriately or inappropriately received reduced dose apixaban, or appropriately received standard dose apixaban. We then compared the outcomes of patients appropriately receiving reduced or standard dose apixaban with similar patients receiving VKA.

### High-dose versus low-dose angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in heart failure: systematic review and meta-analysis [^b4f48c6f]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Protocol and registration

This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis.The protocol was registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), under identification number CRD42017070397.

Search strategy

We systematically searched MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL and LILACS from inception to January 2019. Moreover, we conducted a hand search of the reference lists of relevant articles as an additional source of studies. The following terms were used: ‘angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors’, ‘dose comparison’, ‘low dose’, ‘high dose’, ‘heart failure’ and ‘randomised clinical trial’. We did not include words related to the outcomes of interest to enhance search sensitivity. The search was not restricted by language or publication date filters. We adapted the search terms to fit the requirements of each database. The complete search strategy is presented in online supplementary material 1.

Eligibility criteria and outcomes of interest

We included randomised clinical trials assessing the effect of high-dose versus low-dose ACEIs in adults (aged >18 years) with chronic HF of any aetiology and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (<50%).

We excluded preclinical studies, observational studies, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, case studies, letters, editorials and conference abstracts.

The outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, all-cause hospitalisation, cardiovascular hospitalisation, functional capacity, quality of life and adverse effects. In order to define relevant clinical outcomes, we conducted a literature search and consulted a patient representative. Patients with HF attribute greater value to quality of life than to longevity.Accordingly, patients ascribed higher weight to functional capacity (dyspnoea, daily activities) and adverse effects and lower value to hospitalisation and mortality than healthcare professionals.

### Apixaban dose in patients with atrial Fibrillation and acute coronary syndrome and / or undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: insights from AUGUSTUS [^4733aead]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

A secondary analysis of the ARISTOTLE trial conducted by Alexander et alsought to determine whether the effects of standard dose apixaban (5 mg twice daily) vs warfarin on stroke/systemic embolism and bleeding varied among patients meeting 1 or none of the dose-reduction criteria. The results demonstrated that patients with isolated older age, low body weight, or renal dysfunction had a higher risk of stroke or systemic embolism and major bleeding and consistent benefits with the standard dose of apixaban vs warfarin when compared with patients without these characteristics. The results of this analysis confirmed the safety and efficacy of standard dose apixaban in patients with AF with 1 dose-reduction criterion, even at the extremes of advanced age, low body weight, and renal dysfunction. Similar dose-reduction strategies were used in the ROCKET AF (Rivaroxaban Once-daily, Oral, Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared with Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation) and ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (Effective Anticoagulation with Factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Study 48) trials.

In contrast to the dose-reduction strategies used in ARISTOTLE, ROCKET AF, and ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48, the RE-LY (Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulant Therapy)and ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trialsrandomized patients to a higher and lower dose of dabigatran and edoxaban, respectively. Both of these trials demonstrated lower rates of bleeding and higher rates of stroke or systemic embolism with the lower dose of oral anticoagulant than the higher dose. To the best of our knowledge, our post hoc analysis of the AUGUSTUS trial is the first to assess the effect of a standard vs reduced dose of apixaban in patients with AF and a recent ACS and/or PCI. Together, the findings of the AUGUSTUS trial and our analysis provide valuable insights that can help clinicians make an informed decision about the optimal dose of antithrombotic therapy in the setting of AF and recent ACS or PCI.

### Optimal timing of complete revascularization in acute coronary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1a40d7e7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Data Abstraction

Two abstracters (R.G. and B.H.) independently extracted data from eligible RCTs using a pilot‐tested data collection spreadsheet. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus or, when necessary, by a third individual (K.B.F.). Collected data included trial name, year of publication, number of centers, sample size, maximum follow‐up, number lost to follow‐up, patient characteristics (age, sex, presence of cardiovascular risk factors), infarct location (anterior or inferior), extent of multivessel disease (2‐ or 3‐vessel disease), procedural characteristics (number of treated lesions, number of stents per lesion, number of stents per patient, procedure duration, type of catheter‐based therapy), pharmacological treatment characteristics (administration of antiplatelet agents, β‐blockers, statins, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers), and the primary and secondary end points of interest (defined below).

End Points

The primary end point was the incidence of MACE at longest reported follow‐up. MACE was defined as the composite of all‐cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, recurrent myocardial infarction, and the need for unplanned repeat revascularization (repeat PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting). Secondary outcomes of interest included the short‐term incidence of MACEs, defined as MACEs occurring within 30 days or in‐hospital, the incidence of MACEs at 6 months, and the incidences of the individual components of MACEs in the short term, at 6 months, and at longest follow‐up. Tertiary end points included hemodynamic outcomes (technical success, hemodynamic stability before and after the intervention, left ventricular dysfunction presence and improvement, and periprocedural and postprocedural cardiac arrest), and safety outcomes (contrast‐induced nephropathy, volume of contrast administered, length of procedure, major bleeding, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, major bleeding, minor and major access site bleeding, hemoptysis, and intracranial bleeding).

Urgent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in STEMI—In patients with STEMI in whom percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is not feasible or successful and a large area of myocardium is at risk, emergency or urgent CABG surgery can be effective to improve clinical outcomes (COR 2a, LOE B-NR); when PCI is not possible for anatomic reasons or in the presence of complex disease, CABG surgery can be performed as the primary reperfusion strategy, but after failed PPCI, emergency CABG surgery is not recommended in the absence of a large area of myocardium at risk or if surgical targets are poor and if surgery may be associated with an increased risk of death and adverse cardiovascular outcomes compared with nonsurgical management.

Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

2.5 Treatment

All patients will receive an upfront loading dose of 300 mg aspirin and 300 mg clopidogrel in the emergency room of non‐PCI medical institutions. Potent adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor antagonists, prasugrel, and ticagrelor are not recommended. Patients who have already taken aspirin or ADP receptor antagonists ≤12 hours before screening will be given these agents on the following day. GPI use is not allowed before PCI. The bailout uses of GPI in the catheter lab or post‐catheterization is at the operator's discretion. Routine anticoagulation therapy after PCI is not recommended. Recombinant human prourokinase (rhPro‐UK, Tasly Pharmaceuticals, Shanghai, China), a urokinase precursor that represents a new generation of fibrin‐specific thrombolytic drugs with relatively few adverse reactions, 15 is the thrombolytic agent used in both regimen groups. Comedication consists of unfractionated heparin given as 60 U/kg (up to a maximum of 4000 U) bolus before the thrombolytic agent and will be maintained at 12 U/kg/h (up to a maximum of 1000 U/h) until the catheterization. For coronary angiography, the radial‐artery approach is preferred. During the invasive procedure, an additional intravenous bolus of heparin could be administered if needed to obtain an activated clotting time of 200 to 250 seconds. Beta‐blockers, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers, statins, and post‐interventional antiplatelet therapy will be administered to patients as outlined in the guidelines for myocardial infarction. 2

### Dual renin-angiotensin system inhibition for prevention of renal and cardiovascular events: do the latest trials challenge existing evidence? [^2bf46b90]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

Chronic RAS inhibition using ACE inhibitors or ARBs as monotherapy is the standard of care to treat the vasoconstrictive / pro-inflammatory effects of RAS activation. Despite a strong biological rationale, dual RAS blockade has been largely disappointing, with initial benefits seen on surrogate endpoints not being translated to meaningful superior clinical benefit. Data from outcome trials such as ONTARGET ®, VA NEPHRON-D, ALTITUDE and ASTRONAUT have shown no renal or CV outcome benefits with dual RAS inhibition, and have even shown deleterious effects across most patient groups. For ACE inhibitor / ARB dual therapy, benefits appear confined to symptomatic HF in patients whose symptoms persist in the presence of maximized ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker treatment and not immediately post-MI, and arguably in severe hypertension while balancing the potential adverse effects.

### The efficacy and safety of combination glycoprotein IIbIIIa inhibitors and reduced-dose thrombolytic therapy-facilitated percutaneous coronary intervention for ST-elevation myocardial infarction: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^2265fa58]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

We reviewed the literature and performed a meta-analysis comparing the safety and efficacy of adjunctive use of reduced-dose thrombolytics and glycoprotein (Gp) IIbIIIa inhibitors to the sole use of Gp IIbIIIa inhibitors before percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients presenting with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

Background

Early reperfusion in STEMI is associated with improved outcomes. The use of reduced-dose thrombolytic and Gp IIbIIIa inhibitors combination before PCI in the setting of acute STEMI remains controversial.

Methods

We performed a literature search and identified randomized trials comparing the use of combination therapy-facilitated PCI versus PCI done with Gp IIbIIIa inhibitor alone. Included studies were reviewed to determine Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI)-3 flow at baseline, major bleeding, 30-day mortality, TIMI-3 flow after PCI, and 30-day reinfarction. We performed a random-effect model meta-analysis. We quantified heterogeneity between studies with I2. A value >50% represents substantial heterogeneity.

Results

We identified 4 clinical trials randomizing 725 patients; 424 patients were pretreated with combination therapy before PCI, and 301 patients had Gp IIbIIIa inhibitor alone during PCI. Combination therapy-facilitated PCI was associated with a 2-fold increase in TIMI-3 flow upon arrival to the catheterization laboratory compared with the sole use of upstream Gp IIbIIIa inhibitors (192/390 patients [49%] versus 60/284 [21%]; relative risk [RR], 2.2; P < .00001). However, post-PCI TIMI-3 flow was similar between the 2 groups (279/319 patients [87%] versus 188/212 [88%]; RR, 0.99; P = .85). Major bleeding events significantly increased in the combination therapy group (40/420 patients [9.5%] versus 14/299 [4.7%]; RR, 2.2; P = .007). The 30-day mortality (15/424 patients [3.5%] versus 5/301 [1.7%]; RR, 1.47; P = .46) and 30-day reinfarction rate (5/424 patients [1.1%] versus 3/301 [1.0%]; RR, 0.96; P = .96) were similar in the 2 treatment groups.

Conclusions

Awaiting the results of the ongoing clinical trials, the current cumulative evidence does not support the routine use of combination of reduced-dose thrombolytic and Gp IIbIIIa inhibitor therapy-facilitated PCI for the treatment of STEMI.

Regarding medical management for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to RAAS inhibitors, ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA 2023 guidelines recommend to consider initiating ACEis or ARBs to reduce cardiovascular events in patients with chronic coronary disease without hypertension, diabetes, or CKD and LVEF > 40%.

### Intracoronary compared to intravenous abciximab and high-dose bolus compared to standard dose in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction undergoing transradial primary percutaneous coronary intervention: a two-by-two factorial placebo-controlled randomized study [^728d71da]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Platelet aggregation inhibition (PAI) of > or =95% has been associated with improved outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor treatment. A greater thrombotic burden in acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) might require higher doses and/or intracoronary delivery of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors to achieve optimal PAI. Using a 2 x 2 factorial placebo-controlled design, 105 patients with STEMI who had been referred for primary PCI within 6 hours of symptom onset were randomized to intracoronary (IC) or intravenous (IV) delivery of an abciximab bolus at a standard dose (0.25 mg/kg) or high dose (> or =0.30 mg/kg) of abciximab. The primary end point was PAI measured at 10 minutes after the bolus of abciximab. Secondary end points included the acute and 6-month outcomes using angiographic parameters, cardiac biomarkers, cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging, and clinical end points. At 10 minutes after the bolus, the proportion of patients with > or =95% PAI was not different between the IC and IV groups (53% vs 54%, p = 1.00) nor between the high-dose and standard-dose bolus groups (56% vs 51%, p = 0.70). Acutely, the angiographic myocardial blush grades, peak release of cardiac biomarkers, necrosis size, myocardial perfusion, and no reflow as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging, and clinical end points were similar between the groups and did not suggest a benefit for IC compared to IV or high-dose versus standard-dose bolus of abciximab. No increase occurred in bleeding complications with the high-dose bolus or IC delivery. The clinical, angiographic and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging outcomes at 6 and 12 months were similar between the 4 groups. In conclusion, in patients with STEMI presenting with symptom onset <6 hours and undergoing transradial primary PCI, PAI remained suboptimal, despite a higher dose bolus of abciximab. A higher dose bolus or IC delivery of abciximab bolus was not associated with improved acute or late results compared to the standard IV dosing and administration.
