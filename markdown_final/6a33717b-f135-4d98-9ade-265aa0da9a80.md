## Question

What is the role of music therapy in rehabilitation?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of music therapy in rehabilitation, including mechanisms, evidence by domain, implementation, and limitations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining music therapy and distinguishing it from music medicine. Then, I should verify the neurobiological mechanisms that plausibly explain benefits. Next, I will appraise the evidence across motor, speech/language, cognitive, emotional/behavioral, pain, and quality-of-life domains. After that, I need to consider special populations and settings. Finally, I will examine implementation, feasibility, and evidence gaps before synthesizing a cautious, clinically actionable conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't conflate terms. Music therapy is the clinical, evidence-informed use of music interventions by a credentialed music therapist within a therapeutic relationship to address individualized goals, whereas music medicine refers to passive listening delivered by healthcare staff without a therapeutic process; this distinction matters for interpreting outcomes and fidelity claims [^1143rE8y]. Wait, I should double-check that this distinction is consistently upheld in the cited sources; yes, both neurology and integrative oncology sources align with this therapist-delivered versus non-therapist-delivered framing, which will shape how we weigh evidence quality and generalizability [^115SipiQ] [^115pfg5v].

> Next, I should review mechanisms to ensure clinical plausibility. Music engages reward, arousal, affect regulation, and learning networks, with convergent evidence for dopaminergic and oxytocinergic modulation, and recruitment of motor, auditory, and limbic circuits that support neuroplasticity; rhythmic entrainment can scaffold timing and motor output, which is particularly relevant for gait and upper-extremity rehabilitation [^114XJJQc] [^115UGSWY]. Hold on, I should verify neuroimaging support; systematic reviews of RCTs show structural and functional neuroplasticity after music-based rehabilitation in stroke and other neurological disorders, including gray matter volume changes and white matter integrity improvements linked to language and motor recovery, reinforcing a mechanistic rationale for therapeutic use [^114iXFKy] [^113LJf4G].

> I will now examine motor rehabilitation, especially post-stroke gait and upper extremity function. Rhythmic auditory stimulation improves gait velocity, cadence, and stride length after stroke with moderate-quality evidence, and musical motor feedback can yield larger gains than conventional gait therapy; enriched music-supported therapy for the hemiparetic upper limb shows superiority to conventional programs in chronic stroke, with clinically relevant improvements in motor impairment and quality of life [^115SipiQ] [^114gaCpQ] [^113dqroN]. Wait, let me verify the durability; a multimodal rhythm-and-music intervention produced sustained improvements in perceived recovery and secondary outcomes at 6 months, suggesting potential for durable benefits when intensity and engagement are sufficient [^1124RqFp].

> For speech and language recovery, I should confirm whether music augments aphasia therapy. Cochrane analyses suggest music interventions may improve communication outcomes, including naming and repetition, with moderate effect sizes, and neuroimaging work shows structural and functional changes in language networks correlating with recovery; however, much of the evidence remains low to very low quality, so I need to be cautious in overstatement [^115SipiQ] [^113LJf4G]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought comprehension consistently improves, but I should correct that; while some studies report comprehension gains, meta-analytic signals are stronger for naming and repetition, and heterogeneity in protocols and small samples limit firm conclusions about comprehension outcomes [^115SipiQ] [^113LJf4G].

> Turning to cognition, I need to check both stroke and dementia data. Early post-stroke daily music listening improved verbal memory and focused attention versus audiobooks or no listening, supporting a restorative effect in the subacute phase; in TBI, neurologic music therapy improved executive functioning with concomitant prefrontal gray matter increases, indicating structural correlates of benefit [^112wT1pt] [^116S15vC]. But hold on, let's not jump to conclusions in dementia; Cochrane reviews generally show little to no effect on global cognition, whereas some meta-analyses suggest active music therapy may yield small improvements, highlighting heterogeneity and the need to distinguish active therapist-delivered therapy from passive listening or mixed protocols [^114JuWKi] [^1122YR5R] [^114FTQ4G]. I should confirm guideline positions; primary care guidance allows consideration of music therapy for modest improvements in mood and behavior in MCI/dementia, reflecting a pragmatic, low-risk adjunct stance rather than disease-modifying claims [^117AtJxp].

> For emotional and behavioral domains, I should review anxiety, depression, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Music therapy demonstrates medium effects on anxiety across clinical and subclinical settings, with larger effects for receptive or combined approaches, and small-to-moderate effects on depressive symptoms in multiple populations; in dementia, music-based interventions probably reduce depressive symptoms and overall behavioral problems at end of treatment, though effects on agitation are inconsistent and long-term durability is uncertain [^1113FLih] [^115qRh8H] [^1122YR5R]. Let me reconsider the agitation signal; earlier reviews suggested minimal impact, while some newer syntheses report reductions in neuropsychiatric symptoms, underscoring heterogeneity and the importance of intervention type, setting, and measurement [^114JuWKi] [^117LVywo].

> Pain management is another area where I should verify both perioperative and chronic settings. Music therapy shows moderate pain reduction in adults with cancer and may reduce postoperative pain and opioid requirements after musculoskeletal surgery, though evidence quality is low and implementation barriers exist; ICU guidelines suggest considering music for nonprocedural and procedural pain, but call for more robust trials and clarity on patient selection and preferences [^114qb3hp] [^1144YRq1] [^1159vtaL]. I need to ensure I note feasibility constraints; cost, staffing, and standardization issues have led to limited or conditional recommendations in orthopedic and trauma guidelines, reinforcing the need for pragmatic delivery models [^1144YRq1] [^115iQtyq].

> Quality of life deserves explicit attention because patients and families often prioritize it. Meta-analyses show clinically meaningful improvements in mental health-related quality of life with music interventions, with pooled differences exceeding minimal important change thresholds; stroke-specific work also links rhythmic auditory stimulation to large improvements in stroke-related quality of life, and enriched music-supported therapy improves participation and emotional well-being subdomains [^112yS2wN] [^115SipiQ] [^113dqroN]. Hold on, I should verify that these effects persist; while some inpatient programs show immediate mood and satisfaction gains after single sessions, longer-term QoL benefits likely require sustained, preference-aligned engagement and integration with standard care [^112yiEjn] [^112yS2wN].

> Next, I should review special populations and settings to avoid overgeneralization. In Parkinson's disease, rhythmic auditory cueing improves gait speed, stride length, and reduces freezing, with individual variability linked to rhythmic abilities; autonomous music-based RAS shows promise for real-world walking, though optimal dosing and adherence strategies remain under study [^111BHwp6] [^116thGn9]. In ICU and neurocritical care, music therapy is feasible and may enhance family engagement and recovery trajectories in disorders of consciousness, but evidence is emerging and should be individualized to patient preferences and clinical context [^112MUvmv]. For autism, music therapy probably improves global symptoms and quality of life with moderate certainty, though effects on specific communication domains are less consistent and require trained therapists for fidelity [^116tTTCn]. In palliative and end-of-life care, music therapy is valued for emotional expression, legacy work, and family support, yet access and sustainable funding remain barriers to routine integration [^115T17kY].

> I need to ensure implementation considerations are addressed pragmatically. Barriers include limited workforce (about 10,000 board-certified music therapists in the US), funding constraints, and the need for interdisciplinary integration; facilitators include strong patient and family acceptance, co-treatment models with PT/OT/SLP, and growing interest from health systems, though cost-effectiveness data are limited and reimbursement policies vary [^117MTwvP] [^115R54f5]. Let me verify delivery modes; home-based and tele-monitored protocols are feasible for stroke upper-extremity programs, and receptive approaches can be scaled digitally, but therapist oversight remains important for goal setting, safety, and outcome measurement [^116AKzEB] [^115HWmac].

> But wait, what about evidence quality and methodological limitations; I should double-check the consistency of these concerns. Many trials are small, heterogeneous, and at high risk of performance and detection bias; blinding is often impractical, neuroimaging biomarkers lack standardization, and long-term follow-up is sparse, all of which constrain causal inference and external validity; nonetheless, convergent signals across domains and replication in multiple cohorts support cautious, clinically reasoned adoption [^115SipiQ] [^1119H3UP] [^111Yb3pS]. I should confirm that guidelines mirror this caution; stroke and cognitive rehabilitation guidelines often exclude or do not specifically endorse music-based therapies pending higher-quality trials, while primary care dementia guidance allows consideration for symptom relief, reflecting a balanced, risk–benefit stance [^113wuuro] [^117AtJxp].

> In synthesis, music therapy functions as a multimodal, neurobiologically grounded rehabilitation adjunct that can enhance motor function, support speech and language recovery, modestly improve cognition in selected contexts, reduce anxiety and depressive symptoms, alleviate pain, and improve quality of life, with the strongest evidence in stroke motor rehabilitation and meaningful but lower-certainty signals across other domains; benefits appear maximized when interventions are therapist-delivered, preference-aligned, sufficiently intense, and integrated into interdisciplinary care, while acknowledging workforce, funding, and evidence-quality limitations that call for continued research and pragmatic implementation science [^115SipiQ] [^112yS2wN] [^1113FLih] [^115qRh8H] [^114qb3hp] [^114iXFKy].

Music therapy is a **clinical, evidence-based practice** [^116JArGF] that uses music to address physical, emotional, cognitive, and social needs in rehabilitation. It is delivered by trained music therapists who design individualized interventions to improve motor function, speech and language, cognition, mood, and quality of life [^114XJJQc] [^112yS2wN]. Music therapy is especially effective for stroke, Parkinson's disease, traumatic brain injury, and dementia, and is often integrated with standard care to enhance motivation, engagement, and outcomes [^114XJJQc] [^114iXFKy] [^116PBEaz].

## Clinical applications of music therapy in rehabilitation

Music therapy is used across rehabilitation settings, including neurological, orthopedic, cardiac, and respiratory rehabilitation. Key applications include:

- **Motor rehabilitation**: Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) improves gait, balance, and motor coordination in stroke, Parkinson's disease, and traumatic brain injury [^111BHwp6] [^115SipiQ].

- **Speech and language rehabilitation**: Melodic Intonation Therapy (MIT) and related approaches enhance speech production, fluency, and language recovery in aphasia and other speech disorders [^113LJf4G].

- **Cognitive rehabilitation**: Music-based interventions improve attention, memory, and executive function in traumatic brain injury, stroke, and dementia [^116S15vC] [^112wT1pt] [^117LVywo].

- **Emotional and psychological rehabilitation**: Music therapy reduces anxiety, depression, and stress, and improves mood, self-esteem, and emotional expression [^114XJJQc] [^1113FLih] [^115qRh8H].

- **Social rehabilitation**: Group music therapy enhances social interaction, communication, and social integration, particularly in autism spectrum disorder and dementia [^111qcwTd].

---

## Mechanisms underlying music therapy

Music therapy engages multiple neural systems, enabling broad therapeutic effects:

- **Neuroplasticity**: Music activates and reorganizes brain networks involved in motor control, language, cognition, and emotion, promoting recovery and adaptation [^114XJJQc] [^114iXFKy] [^113LJf4G].

- **Rhythmic entrainment**: External rhythms synchronize motor movements, improving gait, balance, and coordination [^115SipiQ] [^114gaCpQ] [^111BHwp6].

- **Emotional and motivational effects**: Music modulates dopamine, serotonin, and oxytocin, enhancing mood, motivation, and engagement in therapy [^114XJJQc] [^117MTwvP] [^115UGSWY].

- **Stress reduction**: Music lowers cortisol and autonomic arousal, reducing stress and anxiety [^1113FLih] [^115UGSWY].

## Evidence supporting music therapy

Strong evidence supports music therapy across rehabilitation domains:

| **Clinical domain** | **Evidence summary** |
|-|-|
| Motor rehabilitation | - RAS improves gait velocity, stride length, and balance in stroke and Parkinson's disease [^115SipiQ] [^114gaCpQ] [^111BHwp6] |
| Speech and language | - MIT and related approaches improve speech production and language recovery in aphasia [^115SipiQ] [^113LJf4G] |
| Cognitive rehabilitation | - Music interventions improve attention, memory, and executive function in TBI, stroke, and dementia [^112wT1pt] [^116S15vC] [^113EnPET] |
| Emotional and psychological | - Music therapy reduces anxiety, depression, and stress, and improves mood and quality of life [^1113FLih] [^112yS2wN] [^115qRh8H] |
| Social rehabilitation | - Group music therapy enhances social interaction and communication in autism and dementia [^111qcwTd] [^1122YR5R] |

---

## Integration with multidisciplinary rehabilitation

Music therapy is commonly integrated with standard rehabilitation to enhance engagement, motivation, and outcomes. It is delivered individually or in groups and coordinated with physical, occupational, and speech therapy to support comprehensive recovery [^116PBEaz] [^112yiEjn].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Despite strong evidence, music therapy faces several challenges:

- **Standardization**: Variability in interventions, dosing, and outcome measures limits comparability and generalizability [^112yS2wN] [^112YJEhU] [^111Yb3pS].

- **Access and funding**: Limited availability of trained music therapists and funding constraints restrict access [^117MTwvP] [^115T17kY].

- **Individual differences**: Patient preferences, cultural factors, and musical background influence effectiveness, requiring individualized approaches [^112MUvmv] [^111BHwp6].

---

## Future directions

Future research should prioritize **standardized protocols**, larger RCTs, and longitudinal studies to clarify optimal dosing, mechanisms, and long-term effects. Digital and remote delivery models can expand access, and research should explore integration with emerging technologies and personalized medicine [^112YJEhU] [^115HWmac] [^1143rE8y].

---

Music therapy is a **valuable, evidence-based rehabilitation modality** that improves motor, cognitive, emotional, and social outcomes. It is most effective when integrated with multidisciplinary care and tailored to patient needs, though standardization and access remain key challenges.

### Music therapy applied to complex blast injury in interdisciplinary care: a case report [^116PBEaz]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose: Music therapy has a long history of treating the physiological, psychological, and neurological injuries of war. Recently, there has been an increase in the use of music therapy and other creative arts therapies in the care of combat injured service members returning to the United States from Iraq and Afghanistan, especially those with complex blast-related injuries. This case report describes the role of music therapy in the interdisciplinary rehabilitation of a severely injured service member. Methods: Music therapy was provided as stand-alone treatment and in co-treatment with speech language pathology, physical therapy, and occupational therapy. The report is based on clinical notes, self-reports by the patient and his wife, and interviews with rehabilitation team members. Results: In collaboration with other treatment disciplines, music therapy contributed to improvements in range of motion, functional use of bilateral upper extremities, strength endurance, breath support, articulation, task-attention, compensatory strategies, social integration, quality of life, and overall motivation in the recovery process. The inclusion of music therapy in rehabilitation was highly valued by the patient, his family, and the treatment team. Conclusions: Music therapy has optimized the rehabilitation of a service member through assisting the recovery process on a continuum from clinic to community. Implications for Rehabilitation Music therapy in stand-alone sessions and in co-treatment with traditional disciplines can enhance treatment outcomes in functional domains of motor, speech, cognition, social integration, and quality of life for military populations. Music therapists can help ease discomfort and difficulty associated with rehabilitation activities, thereby enhancing patient motivation and participation in interdisciplinary care. Music therapy assists treatment processes from clinic to community, making it highly valued by the patient, family, and interdisciplinary team members in military healthcare. Music therapy provides a platform to prevent social isolation by promoting community integration through music performance.

### Structural and functional neuroplasticity in music and dance-based rehabilitation: a systematic review [^114iXFKy]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In recent years, the concept of art has acquired an increasingly important role in managing and treating many physical, neurological, and psychological disorders. In particular, music and dance have the potential to lower the likelihood of experiencing mental health issues, enhance self-esteem, protect against cognitive decline, aid in the rehabilitation of motor functions, and skills, and promote social cohesion.

Music and dance are universal features of human societies for their capacity to elicit powerful emotions. They have developed into forms of art and entertainment playing a pivotal role in cultural and social practices. They have been shown to influence the functionality of key brain structures associated with emotion, including the amygdala, nucleus accumbens, hypothalamus, hippocampus, insula, cingulate cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex, and with the development of motor expertise including changes in both grey and white matter within the Mirror Neuron System, as well as motor and auditory areas, indicating long-term brain plasticity. Music and dance, with their potential to promote sensory integration, motor coordination, emotional modulation, and memory consolidation, offer a multifaceted approach to neurorehabilitation in the treatment of psychiatric and neurological disorders.

Neurorehabilitation typically adopts a targeted approach focused on rehabilitating a single domain. In contrast, music- and dance-based interventions have the unique ability to simultaneously engage multiple domains within a single intervention. These include not only motor and cognitive functions but also the emotional circuitry, which plays a crucial role in enhancing the motivational aspects of treatment and promoting overall adherence and effectiveness.

Despite all the mentioned evidence, a comprehensive evaluation of the efficacy of these interventions in promoting meaningful structural and functional neuroplasticity in the treatment of neurological disorders is still lacking. This systematic review aims to fill this gap by collecting and synthesizing existing studies examining changes in neuroimaging-derived markers following music- and dance-based rehabilitation interventions among people with neurological disorders in studies using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) study design. Other study designs, such as longitudinal observational studies, case-control reports, or non-randomized trials are undoubtedly valuable for exploring a wide range of neuroplasticity mechanisms associated with music and dance therapy. However, we aimed to assess the added value of music- or dance-based treatment compared to other types of interventions. Additionally, the randomized nature of the included trials ensures that participant selection is not biased toward individuals who might, for instance, have a personal preference for or against music. This reduces selection bias and makes the results more generalizable to broader clinical populations.

### Role of music therapy in neurocritical care for patients with acute brain injury with disorders of consciousness: a narrative review and proposed framework for practice [^112MUvmv]. Neurocritical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Music therapy (MT) holds promise as a treatment for patients with severe acute brain injury (SABI) with disorders of consciousness (DoC) admitted to critical care units. MT leverages the intrinsic properties of music to engage patients and their families, promoting recovery through neurological, psychological, and physiological mechanisms. Although MT is routinely practiced in intensive care and rehabilitation settings, its applications in a neurocritical care context during acute DoC treatment and recovery are underexplored. Further, the subjective nature of music, music preferences, and the variability in patient responses to music-particularly in patients with SABI and DoC-pose unique challenges for implementing a one-size-fits-all approach. Through our institution's experience with MT and a review of previously published evidence, this article illustrates the application of our MT approach as a noninvasive, holistic, and individualized intervention. A case vignette explores MT in the clinical care of a patient with SABI admitted to the neurocritical care unit across a 9-week period, demonstrating the potential of MT to enhance quality of care and recovery outcomes over time. A family impact statement and emerging practice framework are also included to further elucidate the ways in which MT may enhance quality of care and patient recovery in neurocritical care settings.

### Music-based interventions in neurological rehabilitation [^114XJJQc]. The Lancet: Neurology (2017). Medium credibility.

During the past ten years, an increasing number of controlled studies have assessed the potential rehabilitative effects of music-based interventions, such as music listening, singing, or playing an instrument, in several neurological diseases. Although the number of studies and extent of available evidence is greatest in stroke and dementia, there is also evidence for the effects of music-based interventions on supporting cognition, motor function, or emotional wellbeing in people with Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, or multiple sclerosis. Music-based interventions can affect divergent functions such as motor performance, speech, or cognition in these patient groups. However, the psychological effects and neurobiological mechanisms underlying the effects of music interventions are likely to share common neural systems for reward, arousal, affect regulation, learning, and activity-driven plasticity. Although further controlled studies are needed to establish the efficacy of music in neurological recovery, music-based interventions are emerging as promising rehabilitation strategies.

### Is there a role for music in the ICU? [^116BW7Cj]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Recommendation

Music has the potential to benefit critically ill patients. However, the lack of evidence of its efficacy in a broad population and the need for further validation discourages its widespread use at the current time.

### Music interventions for acquired brain injury [^115SipiQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Acquired brain injury (ABI) can result in impairments in motor function, language, cognition, and sensory processing, and in emotional disturbances, which can severely reduce a survivor's quality of life. Music interventions have been used in rehabilitation to stimulate brain functions involved in movement, cognition, speech, emotions, and sensory perceptions. An update of the systematic review published in 2010 was needed to gauge the efficacy of music interventions in rehabilitation for people with ABI.

Objectives

To assess the effects of music interventions for functional outcomes in people with ABI. We expanded the criteria of our existing review to: 1) examine the efficacy of music interventions in addressing recovery in people with ABI including gait, upper extremity function, communication, mood and emotions, cognitive functioning, social skills, pain, behavioural outcomes, activities of daily living, and adverse events; 2) compare the efficacy of music interventions and standard care with a) standard care alone, b) standard care and placebo treatments, or c) standard care and other therapies; 3) compare the efficacy of different types of music interventions (music therapy delivered by trained music therapists versus music interventions delivered by other professionals).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (January 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2015, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1946 to June 2015), Embase (1980 to June 2015), CINAHL (1982 to June 2015), PsycINFO (1806 to June 2015), LILACS (1982 to January 2016), and AMED (1985 to June 2015). We handsearched music therapy journals and conference proceedings, searched dissertation and specialist music databases, trials and research registers, reference lists, and contacted relevant experts and music therapy associations to identify unpublished research. We imposed no language restriction. We performed the original search in 2009.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials that compared music interventions and standard care with standard care alone or combined with other therapies. We examined studies that included people older than 16 years of age who had ABI of a non-degenerative nature and were participating in treatment programmes offered in hospital, outpatient, or community settings. We included studies in any language, published and unpublished.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. We contacted trial researchers to obtain missing data or for additional information when necessary. Where possible, we presented results for continuous outcomes in meta-analyses using mean differences (MDs) and standardised mean differences (SMDs). We used post-test scores. In cases of significant baseline difference, we used change scores. We conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of the randomisation method.

Main Results

We identified 22 new studies for this update. The evidence for this update is based on 29 trials involving 775 participants. A music intervention known as rhythmic auditory stimulation may be beneficial for improving the following gait parameters after stroke. We found a reported increase in gait velocity of 11.34 metres per minute (95% confidence interval (CI) 8.40 to 14.28; 9 trials; 268 participants; P < 0.00001; moderate-quality evidence). Stride length of the affected side may also benefit, with a reported average of 0.12 metres more (95% CI 0.04 to 0.20; 5 trials; 129 participants; P = 0.003; moderate-quality evidence). We found a reported average improvement for general gait of 7.67 units on the Dynamic Gait Index (95% CI 5.67 to 9.67; 2 trials; 48 participants; P < 0.00001). There may also be an improvement in gait cadence, with a reported average increase of 10.77 steps per minute (95% CI 4.36 to 17.18; 7 trials; 223 participants; P = 0.001; low-quality evidence). Music interventions may be beneficial for improving the timing of upper extremity function after stroke as scored by a reduction of 1.08 seconds on the Wolf Motor Function Test (95% CI -1.69 to -0.47; 2 trials; 122 participants; very low-quality evidence). Music interventions may be beneficial for communication outcomes in people with aphasia following stroke. Overall, communication improved by 0.75 standard deviations in the intervention group, a moderate effect (95% CI 0.11 to 1.39; 3 trials; 67 participants; P = 0.02; very low-quality evidence). Naming was reported as improving by 9.79 units on the Aachen Aphasia Test (95% CI 1.37 to 18.21; 2 trials; 35 participants; P = 0.02). Music interventions may have a beneficial effect on speech repetition, reported as an average increase of 8.90 score on the Aachen Aphasia Test (95% CI 3.25 to 14.55; 2 trials; 35 participants; P = 0.002). There may be an improvement in quality of life following stroke using rhythmic auditory stimulation, reported at 0.89 standard deviations improvement on the Stroke Specific Quality of Life Scale, which is considered to be a large effect (95% CI 0.32 to 1.46; 2 trials; 53 participants; P = 0.002; low-quality evidence). We found no strong evidence for effects on memory and attention. Data were insufficient to examine the effect of music interventions on other outcomes. The majority of studies included in this review update presented a high risk of bias, therefore the quality of the evidence is low.

Authors' Conclusions

Music interventions may be beneficial for gait, the timing of upper extremity function, communication outcomes, and quality of life after stroke. These results are encouraging, but more high-quality randomised controlled trials are needed on all outcomes before recommendations can be made for clinical practice.

### Biological principles for music and mental health [^117MTwvP]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Every day, hundreds of millions of people make or listen to music. This appetite is driven by music's core effects on emotion, reward, and affiliation. The value we place on these effects supports a 200 billion dollar per year industry in the US alone. More and more, music's core effects have come into focus for their alignment with core dimensions of mental health, e.g. mood, motivation, pleasure, and social functioning. Together with rapidly increasing awareness of mental health's humanistic and financial importance, this alignment has sparked new investments in music-based interventions from government and industry. This interest presents an opportunity for proponents of music's therapeutic value to increase the specificity and rigor of its application and enhance our understanding of its clinical scope and efficacy.

Meeting this goal depends on a clear conception of music's underlying biology as a source of principles for systematic applications towards specific clinical and subclinical goals. An awareness of such principles exists in music therapy, especially "neurologic" music therapies for motor rehabilitation, but applications in mental health remain highly variable, making it difficult to achieve a unified biologically-informed approach. Moreover, there are far too few music therapists to meet current mental health needs. In the US, for example, there are only about 10,000 board-certified music therapists, compared to about 58 million adults living with mental illness. Assuming an average weekly caseload of 30 patients, total capacity to treat is therefore just 0.5%. Musicians represent another important source of insight, as they are ultimately the most skilled at titrating music's neurophysiological impact. However, the inherently subjective nature of their "artistic" approach can preclude direct integration within a scientific model of health.

### Association of music interventions with health-related quality of life: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111JsPZu]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are music-making and listening interventions associated with positive changes in health-related quality of life?

Findings

This systematic review and meta-analysis of 26 studies comprising 779 individuals found that music interventions were associated with statistically and clinically significant changes in mental HRQOL, both preintervention to postintervention as well as when music interventions were added to treatment as usual vs treatment as usual control groups.

Meaning

These results suggest that associations between music interventions and clinically significant changes in HRQOL are demonstrable in comprehensive reviews of previous studies.

### Music therapy for the treatment of anxiety: a systematic review with multilevel meta-analyses [^113vSqKw]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The current study has several limitations. Firstly, although the evidence for benefit on clinical measures of self-reported anxiety is clinically meaningful and robust to study quality or size, there was insufficient evidence to detect what cohorts might benefit and what 'dose' of music therapy is required. That is, heterogeneity across studies indicates that music therapy could be ineffectual in some settings, but could only be partially explained by study design factors. Similarly, benefits were limited to interventions that included receptive music therapy (by itself or combined with active methods), and there was insufficient evidence to determine the extent to the therapeutic components of music therapy augmented the effects of music listening alone. This question warrants direct comparisons of music interventions delivered by music therapists to those delivered by other professionals. Given capacity limitations and an increased demand for music interventions, such studies could guide clinical implementation, including the settings in which music therapists are most critical to ensure effective delivery. While such research is important, music therapists are essential not only in delivering interventions, but also in guiding how music can be responsibly applied by others in healthcare.

### Music therapy for the treatment of anxiety: a systematic review with multilevel meta-analyses [^115UGSWY]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anxiety, fear, and emotional distress are hallmark features of the most common mental disorders, affecting approximately 4% of the global population at any time and impacting one in three people over their lifetime. Similarly, reviews of anxiety in medical settings found prevalence ranged from 7% to 90% dependent on the diagnosis and severity. As anxiety contributes significantly to healthcare burden, addressing its prevalence and health implications of anxiety is therefore essential to reduce healthcare costs and societal strain.

Research demonstrates that music modulates brain activity in regions associated with emotion and mood regulation, reducing state anxiety, restlessness, and subjective distress, noting that when the music is not matched to the aim, it may worsen symptoms. Music triggers neurotransmitter release, including endorphins, oxytocin, and dopamine, which contribute to well-being and anxiety reduction. Physiological effects, such as decreased heart rate, blood pressure, and cortisol levels, further support music's anxiolytic potential. Music provides a distraction from anxiety-inducing thoughts, enhancing its therapeutic impact. Despite growing evidence from neuroscience and clinical studies, the mechanisms underlying music's anxiety-reducing effects remain complex and multifaceted.

Studies have drawn on these therapeutic benefits of music to address anxiety, including those implemented by music therapists, and those by other health professionals. Music therapy interventions provided by a credentialed music therapist, uses indigenous (active and receptive) music therapy approaches. Receptive music therapy involves clients listening to live or recorded music, facilitated by a trained therapist, and includes techniques like music-assisted relaxation, guided imagery, and lyric analysis to reduce stress, anxiety, and pain while enhancing relaxation. In contrast, active music therapy engages clients in creating music through singing, playing instruments, improvisation, or songwriting, fostering self-expression, communication, and physical movement, and promoting cognitive and motor rehabilitation. Conversely, music interventions implemented by other professionals tend to use music listening (receptive methods). In many prior studies, the term music therapy has been broadly applied to encompass various music-based interventions, including self-administered music listening or music-related activities facilitated by healthcare professionals who are not trained music therapists. To provide clarity and precision in this review, we have focused exclusively on studies where music therapy interventions were delivered by trained music therapists.

### Structural and functional neuroplasticity in music and dance-based rehabilitation: a systematic review [^112YJEhU]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This systematic review highlights the potential of music- and dance-based interventions to induce neuroplastic changes in individuals with neurological disorders, as evidenced by both behavioral and neuroimaging findings. In individuals at risk for dementia, dance interventions emphasize mood, cognitive, and motor function, promoting neuroplasticity in regions crucial for memory and cognitive functions. On the other hand, music-based interventions, particularly in stroke rehabilitation, demonstrated significant impacts on structural and functional neuroplasticity linked to language recovery, memory, and mood regulation through increased connectivity in key brain networks. However, the heterogeneity in intervention protocols and neuroimaging biomarkers across studies limits the ability to draw definitive conclusions regarding their overall efficacy.

To enhance the quality and reproducibility of future research, it is crucial to address key methodological challenges. In particular, greater standardization is needed in the selection and analysis of neuroimaging biomarkers, with a clear a priori definition of outcome measures in study protocols. Additionally, the adoption of shared criteria for neuroimaging data analysis and quality assessment could improve comparability across studies.

Further research should also focus on optimizing intervention parameters, such as duration and intensity, and on including follow-up assessments to evaluate long-term neuroplasticity effects. By addressing these gaps, future studies can contribute to a more robust understanding of the mechanisms underlying music- and dance-based rehabilitation and their potential clinical applications.

### Improving executive functioning and reducing the risk of Alzheimer's disease with music therapy: a narrative review of potential neural mechanisms [^113EnPET]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

As a therapy for AD, music address some of the limitations of pharmaceutical approaches and has shown to improve some symptoms of AD, including impaired executive functions. However, definitive conclusions about the benefits of music therapy for AD are limited by inconsistent methods and findings, and have contributed to the limited knowledge of the neural mechanisms of how music therapy might improve symptoms of AD. This review presents evidence for how music training and therapy might improve executive function deficits in AD and how the FPCN, SN, and DMN have significant roles in maintaining cognitive performance throughout ageing, cognitive decline, and AD, and may be therapeutic targets using music. Evidence suggests that music therapy encapsulates modifiable factors that enhance neural scaffolding and target compensational processes in the brain. To understand the mechanisms by which music therapy improves executive functioning or could reduce the risk of AD, future research should ensure music therapy facilitates active participation, is interdisciplinary, and include or consider neuroimaging to objectively assess changes to functional and compensatory activity in neural networks in response to music therapy in AD. Interdisciplinary research can further assess the effectiveness of music in slowing the rate of cognitive decline and AD onset and progression. As music can still be processed, perceived and interacted with during MCI and all stages of AD, in neural areas fundamental to neural networks highly linked with neural compensation, music training and therapy is a viable therapeutic or co-therapeutic modality to improve executive functioning AD.

### Association of music interventions with health-related quality of life: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112yS2wN]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Increasing evidence supports the ability of music to broadly promote well-being and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). However, the magnitude of music's positive association with HRQOL is still unclear, particularly relative to established interventions, limiting inclusion of music interventions in health policy and care.

Objective

To synthesize results of studies investigating outcomes of music interventions in terms of HRQOL, as assessed by the 36- and 12-Item Health Survey Short Forms (SF-36 and SF-12).

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, ClinicalTrials.gov, and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (searched July 30, 2021, with no restrictions).

Study Selection

Inclusion criteria were randomized and single-group studies of music interventions reporting SF-36 data at time points before and after the intervention. Observational studies were excluded. Studies were reviewed independently by 2 authors.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data were independently extracted and appraised using GRADE criteria (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) by multiple authors. Inverse-variance random-effects meta-analyses quantified changes in SF-36 mental and physical component summary (respectively, MCS and PCS) scores from preintervention to postintervention and vs common control groups.

Main Outcomes and Measures

SF-36 or SF-12 MCS and PCS scores, defined a priori.

Results

Analyses included 779 participants from 26 studies (mean [SD] age, 60 [11] years). Music interventions (music listening, 10 studies; music therapy, 7 studies; singing, 8 studies; gospel music, 1 study) were associated with significant improvements in MCS scores (total mean difference, 2.95 points; 95% CI, 1.39–4.51 points; P < .001) and PCS scores (total mean difference, 1.09 points; 95% CI, 0.15–2.03 points; p = 0.02). In subgroup analysis (8 studies), the addition of music to standard treatment for a range of conditions was associated with significant improvements in MCS scores vs standard treatment alone (mean difference, 3.72 points; 95% CI, 0.40–7.05 points; p = 0.03). Effect sizes did not vary between music intervention types or doses; no evidence of small study or publication biases was present in any analysis. Mean difference in MCS scores met SF-36 minimum important difference thresholds (mean difference 3 or greater).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, music interventions were associated with clinically meaningful improvements in HRQOL; however, substantial individual variation in intervention outcomes precluded conclusions regarding optimal music interventions and doses for distinct clinical and public health scenarios.

### Rhythmic abilities and musical training in Parkinson's disease: do they help? [^111BHwp6]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Music is a universal trait of humankind. The majority can move to the beat, react emotionally to music, recognize well-known tunes, and sing proficiently. These skills, which can be improved via dedicated training, are generally referred to as "musicality", and vary considerably among individuals. Remarkably, individual differences in musicality may play a critical role in understanding the variability of the response to music-based interventions in neurological rehabilitation. In particular, rhythmic skills and the ability to move to the beat of music may predict the well-known response to rhythmic auditory cueing (RAC) on gait of patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD). – In PD, the dysfunctional basal-ganglia-cortical circuitry is associated with timing distortions in the perception and production of rhythmic events. – Providing an external rhythmic cue is likely to compensate for the impaired internal generation of rhythm, as suggested recently. The magnitude of this effect and whether RAC improves or deteriorates motor performance may depend on individual differences in rhythmic skills.

In patients with PD, the immediate beneficial effect of RAC on gait (increased speed, stride length and reduction of freezing episodes) has largely been demonstrated. – However, these effects have only been described at the group level. Even though the effect of stimulation can vary significantly form one study to the other (e.g. with average effect sizes for stride length between 0 and 0.5), individual variability of this response and its determinants have not been examined so far, nor the possibility of deleterious effects of cueing in some patients. Finally, oftentimes music is used by the general population to improve motivation and performance in motor activities, such as in sport. For example, most people run and walk while using music-based applications implemented in mobile devices. Similar music-based applications are already proposed to patientsbut the risks associated with the potential deleterious effects of music delivered by these technologies in patients with PD have never been addressed.

### The impact of musical rehabilitation on complex sound perception in cochlear implant users: a systematic review [^115R7Jdm]. Otology & Neurotology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Musical rehabilitation has been used in clinical and nonclinical contexts to improve postimplantation auditory processing in implanted individuals. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the efficacy of music rehabilitation in controlled experimental and quasi-experimental studies on cochlear implant (CI) user speech and music perception.

Databases Reviewed

PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, PsycARTICLES, and PsycINFO databases through July 2022.

Methods

Controlled experimental trials and prospective studies were included if they compared pretest and posttest data and excluded hearing aid-only users. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were then used to extract data from 11 included studies with a total of 206 pediatric and adult participants. Interventions included group music therapy, melodic contour identification training, auditory-motor instruction, or structured digital music training. Studies used heterogeneous outcome measures evaluating speech and music perception. Risk of bias was assessed using the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Quality Assessment Tool.

Results

A total of 735 studies were screened, and 11 met the inclusion criteria. Six trials reported both speech and music outcomes, whereas five reported only music perception outcomes after the intervention relative to control. For music perception outcomes, significant findings included improvements in melodic contour identification (five studies, p < 0.05), timbre recognition (three studies, p < 0.05), and song appraisal (three studies, p < 0.05) in their respective trials. For speech prosody outcomes, only vocal emotion identification demonstrated significant improvements (two studies, p < 0.05).

Conclusion

Music rehabilitation improves performance on multiple measures of music perception, as well as tone-based characteristics of speech (i.e., emotional prosody). This suggests that rehabilitation may facilitate improvements in the discrimination of spectrally complex signals.

### Rhythmic abilities and musical training in Parkinson's disease: do they help? [^114aD6nR]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

The immediate response to cueing was linked to some aspects of patients' musicality, such as self-assessed perception and musical training. The activities engaging the neural circuitries for beat perception such as learning to play an instrument or singing might thus be put to use in rehabilitation. Whether previous musical training influences the specific neuronal pathways underpinning the beneficial effects of cueing is an open question. Rhythmic cues provide a regular temporal scaffolding supporting motor coordination (e.g. by directing patients' attention towards the onsets of individual steps), thus probably compensating for patients' impaired internal timing. The underlying mechanism would be underpinned by compensatory cortico-subcortical networks such as cerebello–thalamo–cortical circuitries, typically affected only later in the disease, or by the residual activity of cortico-striatal networks. Patients having received some form of musical training may be better equipped to benefit from RAC than non-musicians. In sum, musical experience, as observed in other neurodegenerative disorders or in stroke, may play a neuroprotective role in PD.

### Music therapy for acquired brain injury [^116HsDzK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Acquired brain injury (ABI) can result in impairments in motor function, language, cognition, sensory processing and emotional disturbances. This may severely reduce a survivor's quality of life. Music therapy has been used in rehabilitation to stimulate brain functions involved in movement, cognition, speech, emotions and sensory perceptions. A systematic review is needed to gauge the efficacy of music therapy as a rehabilitation intervention for people with ABI.

Objectives

To examine the effects of music therapy with standard care versus standard care alone or standard care combined with other therapies on gait, upper extremity function, communication, mood and emotions, social skills, pain, behavioral outcomes, activities of daily living and adverse events.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (February 2010), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2009), MEDLINE (July 2009), EMBASE (August 2009), CINAHL (March 2010), PsycINFO (July 2009), LILACS (August 2009), AMED (August 2009) and Science Citation Index (August 2009). We handsearched music therapy journals and conference proceedings, searched dissertation and specialist music databases, trials and research registers, reference lists, and contacted experts and music therapy associations. There was no language restriction.

Selection Criteria

Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials that compared music therapy interventions and standard care with standard care alone or combined with other therapies for people older than 16 years of age who had acquired brain damage of a non-degenerative nature and were participating in treatment programs offered in hospital, outpatient or community settings.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed methodological quality and extracted data. We present results using mean differences (using post-test scores) as all outcomes were measured with the same scale.

Main Results

We included seven studies (184 participants). The results suggest that rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) may be beneficial for improving gait parameters in stroke patients, including gait velocity, cadence, stride length and gait symmetry. These results were based on two studies that received a low risk of bias score. There were insufficient data to examine the effect of music therapy on other outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

RAS may be beneficial for gait improvement in people with stroke. These results are encouraging, but more RCTs are needed before recommendations can be made for clinical practice. More research is needed to examine the effects of music therapy on other outcomes in people with ABI.

### The impact of cardiac rehabilitation exercises incorporating music movement therapy on atrial fibrillation patients: a forward-looking investigation [^116JcAwm]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This research endeavor integrates music therapy and exercise regimens into the CR framework for AF patients, revealing that post-intervention under a modality incorporating music and exercise therapy, patients exhibit restored cardiac functionality, notably abridged AF durations and complication incidences, and ameliorated emotional well-being, sleep quality, and overall quality of life.

The onset of AF inflicts profound detriment on cardiac function, attributable to the loss of atrial contractility and augmented ventricular rates, precipitating acute hemodynamic shifts, ventricular and atrial remodeling, and ultimately structural and functional cardiac alterations, which form the foundation of the myriad complications associated with AF. Consequently, attenuating ventricular rates and enhancing cardiac function are paramount in AF therapeutic strategies. Exercise training constitutes the linchpin of CR programs, and exercise-oriented CR undertakings contribute to the normalization of cardiac function and enhancement of cardiorespiratory health among cardiovascular disease patients. Concurrently, studies posit that routine moderate exercise can significantly curtail ventricular rates and the prevalence of arrhythmic episodes, and may also exert a degree of influence over ventricular remodeling. Music has the capacity to induce a state of arousal within the patient's autonomic nervous system, invigorating the sympathetic nervous system and modulating the cardiac rhythm via the vagus nerve, ultimately influencing heart rate. Empirical evidence corroborates that music therapy can efficaciously modulate heart rate. Furthermore, music augments exercise efficiency, enhances motor functionality, and facilitates post-exercise heart rate recovery. The findings of this investigation underscore that AF patients undergoing CR underpinned by music and exercise therapy manifest reduced LVEDD, resting and exercise ventricular rates, and elevated LVEF compared to those undergoing conventional or exercise-centric CR. In cardiac physiology, LVEDDmeasures chamber size at maximal filling. A decrease reverse remodeling - where the dilated heart returns toward normal dimensions, reducing wall stress and oxygen demand. Conversely, LVEF quantifies systolic function. An increase signifies improved contractility, enabling more efficient blood ejection per heartbeat. Additionally, these patients exhibit notably diminished AF durations and complication incidences post-intervention. This observation underscores that the implementation of CR rooted in music and exercise therapy can effectively bolster cardiac function and mitigate AF durations and complication rates among AF patients. Structured exercise was found to bring about clinically meaningful improvements in systolic function, as evidenced by an increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 2.73% (p = 0.002). However, within this cohort, its impacts on complications and the duration of atrial fibrillation (AF) did not reach statistical significance. This could be attributed to challenges in implementation and limitations of the sample size. Notably, only music - synchronized exercise achieved comprehensive and statistically significant improvements across all endpoints. This finding is consistent with previous research results, further corroborating the beneficial effects of the combination of music and exercise on the cardiac function of AF patients. The underlying mechanisms can be analyzed as follows. Physical exercise exerts a significant anti - inflammatory effect, enhances myocardial contractility, and mitigates myocardial remodeling. These effects effectively reduce the risk factors associated with AF in patients. Meanwhile, music, especially the kind that matches patients' preferences, can effectively promote the concentration and redirection of patients' attention during exercise. As a result, it further enhances patients' focus during cardiac rehabilitation (CR) training and ultimately improves their myocardial function. The efficacy of this intervention may be attributed to **rhythmic entrainment**, a process in which auditory rhythms synchronize motor and cardiovascular activities. Music with a tempo of 90–120 beats per minute (BPM) is in line with the shift of the sympathetic - vagal balance during moderate exercise, potentially enhancing heart rate variability. Importantly, we opted for *receptive* (passive) music - listening during movement instead of *active* music - playing (such as drumming) for the following reasons: (1) Active music - playing demands motor and cognitive resources, which are not practical for AF patients during exercise. (2) Receptive music - listening is more conducive to synchronizing movement in cardiac patients. This approach capitalizes on the **auditory - motor coupling** of music to enhance the benefits of exercise without introducing additional complexity.

### Music therapy in UK palliative and end-of-life care: a service evaluation [^115T17kY]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2018). Medium credibility.

Music therapy aligns to the holistic approach to palliative and end-of-life care (PEOLC), with an emergent evidence base reporting positive effect on a range of health-related outcomes for both patient and family carer alongside high client demand. However, the current service provision and the role of music therapists in supporting individuals receiving PEOLC in the UK is currently unknown.

Objectives

This service evaluation aims to identify the provision, role and perceived impact of UK music therapists in supporting patients receiving PEOLC, their families and health and social care professionals.

Methods

A survey was distributed to the British Association for Music Therapy (BAMT) member mailing list in July 2017. BAMT is the professional body for Health and Care Professions Council registered music therapists in the UK.

Results

Fifty respondents identified themselves as music therapists currently working with clients receiving PEOLC. The respondents largely reported (84.7%) less than 10 years of experience working in PEOLC settings, with only a minority receiving statutory funding for their role. Music therapists most commonly reported supporting adults with neurological conditions, cancers and dementia.

Conclusions

Although promising that evidence suggests provision of music therapy in UK PEOLC settings in the past 10 years to have increased, lack of sustainable funding suggests the role to not be consistently accessible in PEOLC.

### The use of music playlists for people with dementia: a critical synthesis [^116cHE2b]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2017). Low credibility.

This review also demonstrated the need for more robust and replicated research about the value of receptive music interventions that do not involve a music therapist. The literature that exists includes a number of studies with important methodological limitations including small sample sizes, lack of a control group, lack of randomization, and lack of blinding for behavioral raters. Few studies reported effect sizes or gave sufficient information for it to be calculated, making it difficult to assess their relative weight. Attrition rates were also a problem with several studies. While the lack of samples of an adequate size and a high attrition rate are likely inherent in the challenges associated with working with the particular population of interest, the review highlights the need for a greater number of carefully designedrandomized controlled trials in order to clearly establish the efficacy of receptive music interventions.

Similarly, there is a need for better matching of experimental conditions in order to eliminate confounding variables such as the presence of a therapist or the nature of the musical engagement involved. Researchers could also benefit from greater transparency and detail in describing study design. Numerous studies gave insufficient detail in reporting their methods for the reader to determine whether the results can indeed be attributed to the musical intervention or whether they could have been influenced by the human contact inherent in the intervention. These difficulties in the reviewed studies could partly have been overcome by greater clarity in the terminology used by researchers. For example, defining music therapy and clearly describing the role of the therapist or non-therapist-facilitator in the intervention could assist readers to ascertain the degree to which human input is related to the outcome. However, the use of the term 'music therapy' is commonly found in the literature where no trained music therapist is actually involved. Confusion could possibly be avoided in such a case by a clear distinction being made between 'music therapy' and 'music as therapy', or "health musicing" as it is described byBonde.

As music use is so prevalent in daily life and becoming more popular for use with people with dementia, it is important to gain an enhanced understanding of how music is able to reach even those with advanced levels of cognitive decline, and to develop more detailed protocols for its use that take into account both individual music taste, and the symptoms that the music is being used to address. By examining the mechanisms involved, it may be possible to establish a clearer basis for the creation of such protocols. We encourage researchers to conduct carefully designed studies in which conditions are carefully matched and that seek to overcome many of the limitations found in the literature that are discussed above.

### Music therapy for the treatment of anxiety: a systematic review with multilevel meta-analyses [^116JArGF]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Eligibility criteria

Eligible studies were RCTs or CCTs that examined the effect of music therapy on anxiety outcomes in adults with elevated anxiety symptoms in clinical, occupational or educational settings.

Populations

Adults aged > 18 years with anxiety symptoms at baseline, with or without a formal diagnosis of anxiety disorder. Studies targeting people younger than 18 or those with dementia were excluded.

Interventions

Eligible studies provided music therapy, defined as the clinical and evidence-informed use of music interventions by a qualified music therapist, to accomplish individualized goals within a therapeutic relationship in order to achieve physical, emotional, mental, social and cognitive needs. Interventions that were not delivered by a music therapist or did not follow the principles of music therapy, namely did not facilitate a therapeutic process or did not use tailored personal music experiences were excluded.

Comparisons

Eligible studies compared music therapy to one or more control condition, including care/treatment as usual, passive/waitlist control or alternative interventions, including music interventions not considered as music therapy. If studies included multiple control conditions, all eligible control groups were included.

Outcomes

Eligible studies reported at least one direct psychological or physiological measure of anxiety. For psychological outcomes, this included validated self-report measures of state or trait anxiety (e.g. State-Trait Anxiety Inventory). For physiological outcomes, objective measures such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, or cortisol assessed using standardized clinical procedures. This clarification was made post hoc and was not explicitly stated in the original PROSPERO registration (CRD42024495801) but aligns with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Outcome measures indirectly related to anxiety, such as to quality of life (QoL), distress or pain were excluded.

### A systematic review of quality dementia clinical guidelines for the development of WHO's package of interventions for rehabilitation [^1122KcYx]. The Gerontologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This first systematic review of quality guidelines for dementia was undertaken as part of WHO's PIR initiative, to identify high-quality dementia recommendations for rehabilitation, which will inform the development of a PIR for dementia. The findings suggest that dementia-specific and holistic rehabilitation and reablement interventions are largely absent across the CPGs, underscoring the urgent need for a shift in mindset to bring rehabilitation to the forefront of quality clinical management in dementia. However, there is a sufficient number of strong recommendations, with moderate- to high-quality evidence that can be easily introduced in routine practice. They include group cognitive stimulation therapy, group reminiscence therapy, physical exercise, carer support, education and skills training, psychosocial and environmental interventions, multisensory interventions and ambient music, a reframing therapy, errorless learning, Montessori and spaced retrieval methods. There are also additional strong recommendations with some evidence that have good potential to be safely used in routine practice such as personalized activities, comprehensive assessment, occupational therapy interventions, carer support to build resilience, assessment of carers needs and communication styles, and communication partner training.

### Structural and functional neuroplasticity in music and dance-based rehabilitation: a systematic review [^112NP86N]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Music- and dance-based rehabilitation has gained prominence in promoting social engagement and improving motor, cognitive, and mood domains in individuals affected by different neurological disorders.

Aim

This systematic review aims to synthesize existing evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating neuroimaging-based structural and functional neuroplasticity following music- and dance-based interventions among people with neurological disorders.

Methods

Literature research was performed using PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus, and Web of Science (WOS). A multidimensional approach was employed to assess the efficacy of music- and dance-based interventions, integrating neuroimaging and clinical assessments.

Results

Out of a total of 2247 papers reviewed, 20 RCTs met the inclusion criteria for this review, with a total of 718 subjects. Among them, 88% underwent a neuroimaging investigation to evaluate structural or functional neuroplasticity. Six studies involved dance-based interventions, while 14 examined music-based rehabilitation. These interventions targeted cognitive, motor, and mood impairments in people at risk of dementia or with neurological disorders including Huntington's Disease, stroke, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, and disorder of consciousness.

Discussion

Overall, the selected studies demonstrated significant effects on behavioral and neuroimaging outcomes, showing structural and functional changes in critical areas for perception and memory in patients at risk of dementia, as well as in regions essential for language processing, emotional regulation, and motor control in patients with acute and chronic stroke. Nevertheless, several biases were identified, specifically related to neuroimaging biomarkers, such as a lack of baseline and between-group comparisons and a lack of prior registration of neuroimaging biomarkers investigated.

The protocol of this review was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), with registration number CRD42024574754.

### Music-based therapeutic interventions for people with dementia [^114JuWKi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Dementia is a clinical syndrome with a number of different causes which is characterised by deterioration in cognitive, behavioural, social and emotional functions. Pharmacological interventions are available but have limited effect to treat many of the syndrome's features. Less research has been directed towards non-pharmacological treatments. In this review, we examined the evidence for effects of music-based interventions.

Objectives

To assess the effects of music-based therapeutic interventions for people with dementia on emotional well-being including quality of life, mood disturbance or negative affect, behavioural problems, social behaviour and cognition at the end of therapy and four or more weeks after the end of treatment.

Search Methods

We searched ALOIS, the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG) on 19 June 2017 using the terms: music therapy, music, singing, sing, auditory stimulation. Additional searches were carried out on 19 June 2017 in the major healthcare databases MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS; and in trial registers and grey literature sources.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of music-based therapeutic interventions (at least five sessions) for people with dementia that measured any of our outcomes of interest. Control groups either received usual care or other activities with or without music.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors worked independently to screen the retrieved studies against the inclusion criteria and then to extract data and assess methodological quality of the included studies. If necessary, we contacted trial authors to ask for additional data, including relevant subscales, or for other missing information. We pooled data using random-effects models.

Main Results

We included 22 studies with 1097 randomised participants. Twenty-one studies with 890 participants contributed data to meta-analyses. Participants in the studies had dementia of varying degrees of severity, and all were resident in institutions. Seven studies delivered an individual music intervention; the other studies delivered the intervention to groups of participants. Most interventions involved both active and receptive musical elements. The methodological quality of the studies varied. All were at high risk of performance bias and some were at high risk of detection or other bias. At the end of treatment, we found low-quality evidence that the interventions may improve emotional well-being and quality of life (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 0.62; 9 studies, 348 participants) and reduce anxiety (SMD -0.43, 95% CI -0.72 to -0.14; 13 studies, 478 participants). We found low-quality evidence that music-based therapeutic interventions may have little or no effect on cognition (SMD 0.15, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.36; 7 studies, 350 participants). There was moderate-quality evidence that the interventions reduce depressive symptoms (SMD -0.27, 95% CI -0.45 to -0.09; 11 studies, 503 participants) and overall behaviour problems (SMD -0.23, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.01; 10 studies, 442 participants), but do not decrease agitation or aggression (SMD -0.07, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.10; 14 studies, 626 participants). The quality of the evidence on social behaviour was very low, so effects were very uncertain. The evidence for long-term outcomes measured four or more weeks after the end of treatment was of very low quality for anxiety and social behaviour, and for the other outcomes, it was of low quality for little or no effect (with small SMDs, between 0.03 and 0.34).

Authors' Conclusions

Providing people with dementia who are in institutional care with at least five sessions of a music-based therapeutic intervention probably reduces depressive symptoms and improves overall behavioural problems at the end of treatment. It may also improve emotional well-being and quality of life and reduce anxiety, but may have little or no effect on agitation or aggression or on cognition. We are uncertain about effects on social behaviour and about long-term effects. Future studies should examine the duration of effects in relation to the overall duration of treatment and the number of sessions.

### Biological principles for music and mental health [^113CsJYs]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Given the uncertainty in defining the relationship between music and health, funders have sought to advance applications by casting a wide net. The National Institutes of Health, for example, has sponsored an extensive list of research topics involving music, including improving treatment response in cancer, stress and pain management in surgery, affect modulation in mood disorders, anxiolysis in anxiety disorders, social functioning in neurodevelopmental disorders, palliative care in advanced illness, neural rehabilitation after injury, and wellness through exercise. This breadth is likely to puzzle many medical professionals and raise skepticism in more than a few. Can music really be such a panacea?

While skepticism is justified (as discussed in Section "Skepticism and need"), clear evidence of music's effects on core mental health variables is readily apparent in our growing understanding of music's biological foundations. Critically, these foundations provide a rational basis for standardizing and expanding music's psychiatric applications and benefits. In this review, I outline a framework for music in human biology and describe some of its basic implications for standardized music-based interventions in mental health, with the goal of increasing biomedical integration and impact.

### Structural and functional neuroplasticity in music and dance-based rehabilitation: a systematic review [^111Yb3pS]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Data analysis

One significant limitation was the lack of baseline comparisons for neuroimaging biomarkers, which were reported in only six trials, thus limiting the ability to conduct robust between-group analyses. The latter were absent in four studies. Furthermore, a detailed description of postprocessing methods, including data normalization, was fully provided in only two studies. Finally, none of the studies incorporated adherence or attendance to the rehabilitation intervention as a variable of interest or covariate. To overcome these limitations, it would be advisable that, when neuroimaging biomarkers are used as outcome measures in RCTs, they are first declared in the trial protocol registration and subsequently included among the randomization criteria for the sample or, at the very least, carefully assessed prior to conducting between-group analyses. Moreover, a detailed description of the methods used to analyze neuroimaging biomarkers is absolutely essential to evaluate their reliability and to ensure their reproducibility. Finally, considering that the majority of studies have evaluated how the structure and/or function of the brain changed at the level of individual areas or white matter tracts involved, and that only three studies have analyzed connectivity variations between them, it is desirable that future studies investigate the impact of music- and dance-based rehabilitation also at the level of the overall functioning of the brain network.

Clinical implications

Despite these limitations, some findings, if confirmed by further studies, could have important clinical implications. For example, neuroplasticity effects have been observed in the hippocampus of patients at risk of dementia and in the frontal language areas of patients with post-stroke aphasia, both in the acute and chronic phases. These effects occur in brain regions that are crucial for the disabilities associated with these conditions. Therefore, a significant impact of rehabilitative interventions in these areas could play a key role in preserving or restoring functions, ultimately helping to counteract disability and improve patients' quality of life.

### Music therapy for autistic people [^116tTTCn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Social interaction and social communication are among the central areas of difficulty for autistic people. Music therapy uses music experiences and the relationships that develop through them to enable communication and expression, thus attempting to address some of the core problems of autistic people. Music therapy has been applied in autism since the early 1950s, but its availability to autistic individuals varies across countries and settings. The application of music therapy requires specialised academic and clinical training which enables therapists to tailor the intervention to the specific needs of the individual. The present version of this review on music therapy for autistic people is an update of the previous Cochrane review update published in 2014 (following the original Cochrane review published in 2006).

Objectives

To review the effects of music therapy, or music therapy added to standard care, for autistic people.

Search Methods

In August 2021, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, eleven other databases and two trials registers. We also ran citation searches, checked reference lists, and contacted study authors to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomised trials and controlled clinical trials comparing music therapy (or music therapy alongside standard care) to 'placebo' therapy, no treatment, or standard care for people with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder were considered for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Four authors independently selected studies and extracted data from all included studies. We synthesised the results of included studies in meta-analyses. Four authors independently assessed risk of bias (RoB) of each included study using the original RoB tool as well as the certainty of evidence using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: We included 16 new studies in this update which brought the total number of included studies to 26 (1165 participants). These studies examined the short- and medium-term effect of music therapy (intervention duration: three days to eight months) for autistic people in individual or group settings. More than half of the studies were conducted in North America or Asia. Twenty-one studies included children aged from two to 12 years. Five studies included children and adolescents, and/or young adults. Severity levels, language skills, and cognition were widely variable across studies. Measured immediately post-intervention, music therapy compared with 'placebo' therapy or standard care was more likely to positively effect global improvement (risk ratio (RR) 1.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06 to 1.40; 8 studies, 583 participants; moderate-certainty evidence; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 11 for low-risk population, 95% CI 6 to 39; NNTB = 6 for high-risk population, 95% CI 3 to 21) and to slightly increase quality of life (SMD 0.28, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.49; 3 RCTs, 340 participants; moderate-certainty evidence, small to medium effect size). In addition, music therapy probably results in a large reduction in total autism symptom severity (SMD -0.83, 95% CI -1.41 to -0.24; 9 studies, 575 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). No clear evidence of a difference between music therapy and comparison groups at immediately post-intervention was found for social interaction (SMD 0.26, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.57, 12 studies, 603 participants; low-certainty evidence); non-verbal communication (SMD 0.26, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.55; 7 RCTs, 192 participants; low-certainty evidence); and verbal communication (SMD 0.30, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.78; 8 studies, 276 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Two studies investigated adverse events with one (36 participants) reporting no adverse events; the other study found no differences between music therapy and standard care immediately post-intervention (RR 1.52, 95% CI 0.39 to 5.94; 1 study, 290 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this updated review provide evidence that music therapy is probably associated with an increased chance of global improvement for autistic people, likely helps them to improve total autism severity and quality of life, and probably does not increase adverse events immediately after the intervention. The certainty of the evidence was rated as 'moderate' for these four outcomes, meaning that we are moderately confident in the effect estimate. No clear evidence of a difference was found for social interaction, non-verbal communication, and verbal communication measured immediately post-intervention. For these outcomes, the certainty of the evidence was rated as 'low' or 'very low', meaning that the true effect may be substantially different from these results. Compared with earlier versions of this review, the new studies included in this update helped to increase the certainty and applicability of this review's findings through larger sample sizes, extended age groups, longer periods of intervention and inclusion of follow-up assessments, and by predominantly using validated scales measuring generalised behaviour (i.e. behaviour outside of the therapy context). This new evidence is important for autistic individuals and their families as well as for policymakers, service providers and clinicians, to help in decisions around the types and amount of intervention that should be provided and in the planning of resources. The applicability of the findings is still limited to the age groups included in the studies, and no direct conclusions can be drawn about music therapy in autistic individuals above the young adult age. More research using rigorous designs, relevant outcome measures, and longer-term follow-up periods is needed to corroborate these findings and to examine whether the effects of music therapy are enduring.

### Efficacy of music therapy as a non-pharmacological measure to support Alzheimer's disease patients: a systematic review [^116AxzEj]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

As a non-pharmacological intervention, MT helps AD patients to promote memory and thinking skills and improve emotional and behavioural problems. This has important implications for the current life of dementia patients, helping them delay the disease process, improving their quality of life and extending healthy life. Therefore, MT is a promising non-pharmacological treatment approach for AD patients.

### Background music and memory in mild cognitive impairment: the role of interindividual differences [^116Q3cK5]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Music therapy and background music in aging and cognitive decline

Music therapy is the clinical use of music aimed at treating cognitive and behavioral disorders. It may include a variety of therapeutic interventions based on listening, singing, playing instruments, or composing music. It has been widely used in aging and cognitive decline, but evidence of its efficacy is still controversial. The Cochrane review by Vink et al. examined ten studies of patients with dementia undergoing music therapy; their review was inconclusive on the efficacy of music therapy because of the poor methodological quality in these studies. In a subsequent Cochrane review by van der Steen et al. 22 studies were included. They concluded that at least five sessions of music-based intervention may produce benefits for depression and improve emotional being for individuals with dementia. However, both Cochrane reviews arrived at the conclusion that music therapy had little or no effect on cognition in this patient population. Conversely, a review by Moreno-Morales et al. which included eight studies on patients with dementia, concluded that music-based therapies may improve cognition. Specifically, they found that shorter interventions (less than 20 weeks) and those based on listening to music improved general cognition outcomes in patients with mild to moderate dementia.

### Musical and psychomotor interventions for cognitive, sensorimotor, and cerebral decline in patients with mild cognitive impairment (COPE): a study protocol for a multicentric randomized controlled study [^117ND4a4]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Then, in contrast to gross motor functions implicated in psychomotor therapy, fine sensorimotor skills play a crucial role in playing a musical instrument, including bimanual coordination.

Finally, music-making's emotional and rewarding aspects represent an intrinsic motivator underpinned by neurochemistry (e.g. dopamine release). Musical activities also impact other physiological processes, inciting potential positive effects on the cardiovascular system (cortisol decrease) and increasing stamina (dopamine increase), via neurochemistry.

Musical training performed during youth or midlife positively influences cognitive reserve (resilience to neuro-pathological damage in older adults), and may delay the onset of dementia. Improved executive function, well-being, visual memory, and hearing in noise manifested in healthy older adults after musical training starting at an advanced age. Several recent studies could show advantages following musical training after retirement in healthy older adults, associated with brain changes, for certain capacities implied in activities of daily living (speech in noise perception, verbal memory, and manual dexterity). Musical training thus seems a promising approach.

### Structural and functional neuroplasticity in music and dance-based rehabilitation: a systematic review [^111xqEww]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Study selection process

Search results were managed using the Rayyan platform. After removing duplicates, two reviewers independently screened the title and abstract of studies against the eligibility criteria.

Exclusion criteria included the absence of a full paper (e.g. books, book chapters, qualitative studies, letters, comments, dissemination papers, or published abstracts without full text) and non-English language. Additionally, studies that did not refer to an RCT experimental design, such as reviews, observational studies, study protocols, or case reports, were excluded. Finally, only studies involving rehabilitation interventions with music or dance and neuroimaging-derived outcome measures were included. The full-text analysis of all relevant studies was performed to ensure compliance with the eligibility criteria. Inter-reviewer discrepancies were resolved through discussion to reach a consensus or by consulting a third reviewer when an agreement was not reached.

Study risk of bias assessment

The "Tool for the assessment of study quality and reporting in the exercise" scale (TESTEX) was blindly used by two reviewers to evaluate the quality of RCT studies. Any inter-reviewer disagreements were resolved either by consensus or by the third reviewer. Each study selected for the systematic review was assessed based on 12 validity criteria, with a total score ranging from 0 to 15.

Data extraction

Two researchers conducted data extraction independently and blindly, following a standardized form. For data collection, the inter-reviewer disagreements were solved either by consensus or by the third reviewer when an agreement could not be reached.

Data collection focused on: 1) demographics and clinical characteristics of the sample (size, sex, age, and type of pathology); 2) type of treatment (music-based or dance-based rehabilitation) for both intervention and control groups; 3) intervention parameters (frequency and duration of the sessions); 4) neuroimaging markers; 5) behavioral data (neuropsychological and neurological assessment, adherence, attendance, and safety).

### Music therapy as a complementary treatment in patients with dementia associated to Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review [^1157efQR]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex condition that affects various aspects of a patient's life. Music therapy may be considered a beneficial supplementary tool to traditional therapies, that not fully address the range of AD manifestations.

Objective

The purpose of this systematic review is to investigate whether music therapy can have a positive impact on AD patients and on which symptoms.

Methods

The main research databases employed have been PubMed and Cochrane, using the keywords "dementia", "music therapy", "Alzheimer", "fMRI", "music", and "EEG".

Results

After removing duplicates and irrelevant studies, 23 were screened using set criteria, resulting in the final inclusion of 15 studies. The total number of participants included in these studies has been of 1,196 patients. For the fMRI analysis the search resulted in 28 studies on PubMed, two of which were included in the research; the total number of participants was of 124 individuals. The studies conducted with EEG were found using PubMed. The initial search resulted in 15 studies, but after a more accurate evaluation only 2 have been included in the analysis.

Conclusions

Even though the data currently available is not sufficient to draw conclusions supported by robust statistical power, the impact of music therapy on AD neuropsychiatric symptoms deserves great interest. Further research should be ushered, possibly multicentric studies, led with neuroimaging and other recent techniques, which can eventually open views on the music role in improving the cognitive status in AD.

### Home-based neurologic music therapy for arm hemiparesis following stroke: results from a pilot, feasibility randomized controlled trial [^116AKzEB]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

A total of 80% of stroke cases result in hemiparesis, and half this number experience persistent lack of arm function. Effective interventions are lacking, and evidence to support those that are accessible is insufficient. A clear need has been identified for long-term support in the community for people with stroke, but services are limited and few studies have examined home-based interventions and provided sufficient detail of the protocols used.

Music interventions may be beneficial for improving arm function following stroke, and a strong rhythmic stimulus embedded within music may enhance motor performance more than the use of a rhythmic stimulus alone without music. More research is needed to establish the effects of music interventions on arm function, and with the majority of rehabilitation being delivered in patients' homes it is useful to determine the feasibility of home-based treatment delivery and research. This article reports on the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial where a music intervention, for which there was a clear protocol based on published guidelines, was delivered in a variety of home environments.

### The impact of cardiac rehabilitation exercises incorporating music movement therapy on atrial fibrillation patients: a forward-looking investigation [^116rxVST]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

The music-movement CR group integrates music therapy and exercise training into conventional CR regimens. Specifically: (1) Professional music therapists curate serene and aesthetically pleasing musical selections tailored to the patients' medical conditions, personal preferences, personality traits, and occupations, ensuring a balanced musical portfolio. The music intervention protocol for the Music - Movement CR Group involved carefully selecting music with a tempo of 90–120 BPM to match cardiac rehabilitation exercise cadence, using instrumental pieces with stable harmonic progressions to reduce cognitive distraction, maintaining the volume at 30–50 dB adjusted by patient feedback. (2) The exercise training regimen and implementation for the music-movement CR group mirror those of the movement CR group. Preceding the exercise sessions, nurses or family members select a tranquil, distraction-free environment, where music therapists introduce the instruments, composers, and the emotional and aesthetic nuances of the music, frequently altering the selections in response to patient preferences. (3) During the exercise training, music therapists and clinical rehabilitation specialists guide patients in synchronized movements with the music's rhythm, such as walking in cadence with the music. (4) Throughout the CR exercise sessions, music therapists select appropriate music aligned with the patients' movements, fostering an immersive experience of diverse musical atmospheres while maintaining a volume level of 30dB to 50dB, adjusted for the patients' comfort. Prior to discharge, music therapists train and instruct patients and their families in selecting music during exercise. Post-discharge, healthcare providers and music therapists sustain real-time interactions via WeChat and conduct follow-up calls. Patients are also encouraged to attend regular outpatient follow-ups for timely adjustments to the music therapy regimen.

### The comparison between pulmonary rehabilitation with music therapy and pulmonary rehabilitation alone on respiratory drive, cortisol level and asthma control in patients hospitalized with asthma exacerbation [^111Tujjf]. The Journal of Asthma (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Much emphasis is being placed on the role of music therapy as an easy-to-use, noninvasive and relatively cheap method of asthma treatment. The objective of this interventional double-blinded randomized controlled trial was to assess whether music therapy, as a complementary modality to pulmonary rehabilitation, can help to improve respiratory drive, asthma control and quality of life in patients with asthma exacerbation.

Methods

Hospitalized patients with asthma exacerbation enrolled in the study were randomly assigned to experimental (music therapy) or control (popular science program) group. Both groups during hospitalization received standard pharmacotherapy accompanied by respiratory physiotherapy. Respiratory drive, asthma control, quality of life and serum cortisol in all participants were assessed at the beginning and at the end of their hospitalizations.

Results

The experimental group consisted of 39 asthmatics and 34 subjects with asthma were assigned to the control group. During the hospitalization, the levels of the inspiratory occlusion pressure for the first 0.1s of inspiration (P0.1) decreased (p = 0.004) and the maximum P0.1 increased (p = 0.041) only in the experimental group. The serum cortisol level decreased in both groups (p = 0.001). The changes in asthma control and quality of life did not reach significant levels in either subject group.

Conclusion

Passive music therapy and its effects on the mental state of patients seem to improve the efficiency of the respiratory system. The results of this experimental study demonstrate that a complementary music therapy has beneficial effects on the treatment of asthma exacerbations in adults.

### Clinical practice guidelines for pain management in acute musculoskeletal injury [^116HiZvZ]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2019). Medium credibility.

RECOMMENDATIONS

Cognitive and Emotional Strategies

- The panel recommends discussing alleviation of pain, expected recovery course, and patient experience at all encounters (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).
- The panel recommends connecting patients with pain that is greater or more persistent than expected and patients with substantial symptoms of depression, anxiety, or posttraumatic stress or less effective coping strategies (greater catastrophic thinking and lower self-efficacy) to psychosocial interventions and resources (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence).
- The panel recommends that clinicians consider using anxiety-reducing strategies to increase self-efficacy and promote peace of mind with patients like aromatherapy, music therapy, or cognitive behavioral therapy (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence).

### Efficacy of music therapy as a non-pharmacological measure to support Alzheimer's disease patients: a systematic review [^113mKJvq]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative disease of the central nervous system characterized by progressive memory degradation and language and behavior disorders. Apart from curative pharmacological therapies, music therapy (MT) has been diffusely used as an efficient and economical non-pharmacological treatment for AD patients in recent years.

Methods

Three databases (PubMed, Web of Science and PsycINFO) were searched to analyse the efficacy of MT in patients with AD. Keywords included "Alzheimer's disease", "AD", "Mild Cognitive Impairment", "MCI", "music" and "music therapy".

Results

Literatures between January 2013 and January 2023 were selected, with 42 literatures included in the study, which highlights the beneficial impact of MT on cognition (memory, attention, language), behavioural and psychological symptoms (anxiety, depression and agitation), quality of life, self-esteem and physical pain in AD patients.

Conclusion

MT is a promising non-pharmacological treatment approach for individuals living with AD. However, further evidences from prospective, randomised, blinded, uniform, and rigorous method-logical investigations in this field are required to conclusively validate MT's impact on this disease. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD420251034039.

### Development and integration of a music therapy program in the neurologic inpatient setting: a qualitative study [^115R54f5]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Explore facilitators and barriers to development and integration of an inpatient music therapy (MT) program from the perspective of the patient, family member, and health care professional.

Materials and Methods

This qualitative study recruited patients on acute neurosciences/neurorehabilitation units having participated in the hospital MT program, their family, and members of their health care team. Semi-structured individual interviews and focus groups were conducted with 35 participants (14 patients, 5 family members, 16 health care professionals). Interviews/focus groups were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were coded in duplicate and a codebook was developed through an iterative process.

Results

Four dominant themes emerged from the data: (1) facilitators of program operations; (2) barriers to program establishment; (3) perceived positive impact on patient outcomes; and (4) opportunity for improvement. Facilitator sub-themes included a love for music that encouraged participation, broad appeal of MT, and support of the health care team.

Conclusions

Patients, health care professionals, and family members accepted MT as a treatment modality. While there is growing evidence for MT in neurorehabilitation, practical challenges remain in developing inpatient MT services, including funding, and optimal integration of music therapists into existing care teams.

### Structural and functional neuroplasticity in music and dance-based rehabilitation: a systematic review [^1119H3UP]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

In this section, we aim to highlight some limitations of the present review. First, it is important to emphasize that the primary outcomes considered — namely, neuroimaging-derived structural and functional changes — represent highly restrictive selection criteria. These criteria were chosen to address a gap in the literature by focusing on the neurobiological mechanisms underlying these interventions, with the specific goal of elucidating neuroplasticity mechanisms, including structural and functional brain changes. As a result, numerous studies examining variables such as gait, balance, movement, voice, and quality of life — factors that are crucial for understanding the broader clinical impact of music- and dance-based interventions — were not included in this review. For this reason, studies on conditions such as Parkinson's disease, in which music- and dance-based treatments have been extensively investigated and have demonstrated significant clinical effects on motor symptoms, balance, functional mobility, and cognitive function, were not discussed. Despite these limitations, our study remains relevant as it aims to complement existing literature by providing novel insights into the underlying brain mechanisms, which are often underexplored.

Below, a structured overview of the limitations of the studies included in this review is provided.

Sample

Despite the wide variability in the neurological disorders of the studies included in this systematic review, some trials have enrolled a relatively small number of participants. This limitation is due to the fact that some studies focus on rare pathologies or conditions, such as HD and MCS, which limits the possibility of recruiting large samples.

Replicability

The studies in this systematic review covered various neurological pathologies and provided interventions targeting different circuits and functions. A common limitation was that imaging analyses were conducted on sub-samples from the original behavioral RCT, often lacking comprehensive clinical data and data analyses reports. This discrepancy can hinder the replicability and robustness of the findings.

Follow-up

Only one study included in this systematic review reported data on follow-up; limiting the ability to draw robust conclusions about the efficacy of the treatment over time.

Variability of biomarkers

Virtually each included study investigated a different neuroimaging marker, including GMV, WM integrity, anisotropy, FC, and brain activation, complicating the synthesis of findings about the overall effectiveness of music- and dance-based interventions on neuroplasticity. Compounding this issue is the absence of standardized assessment scales for evaluating the quality of neuroimaging measurements. Without such objective criteria, it becomes difficult to systematically assess and compare the reliability of the neuroimaging findings across studies.

### Music-based therapeutic interventions for people with dementia [^1122YR5R]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Dementia is a clinical syndrome with a number of different causes. It is characterised by deterioration in cognitive, behavioural, social and emotional functioning. Pharmacological interventions are available but have limited effect on many of the syndrome's features. However, receptivity to music may remain until the late phases of dementia, and music-based therapeutic interventions (which include, but are not limited to, music therapy) are suitable for people with advanced dementia. As there is uncertainty about the effectiveness of music-based therapeutic interventions, trials are being conducted to evaluate this. This review updates one last published in 2018 and examines the current evidence for the effects of music-based interventions for people with dementia.

Objectives

To assess the effects of music-based therapeutic interventions for people with dementia on emotional well-being (including quality of life), mood disturbance or negative affect (i.e. depressive symptoms and anxiety), behavioural problems (i.e. overall behavioural problems or neuropsychiatric symptoms, and more specifically agitation or aggression), social behaviour and cognition, at the end of therapy and four or more weeks after the end of treatment, and to assess any adverse effects.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Embase (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Web of Science Core Collection (ISI Web of Science), LILACS (BIREME), ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organisation's meta-register-the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 30 November 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of music-based therapeutic interventions (of at least five sessions) for people with dementia that measured any of our outcomes of interest. Control groups either received usual care or other activities with or without music.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors worked independently to screen the retrieved studies against the inclusion criteria and then to extract data from included studies and assess their risk of bias. If necessary, we contacted trial authors to ask for additional data, such as relevant subscales. We pooled data using the random-effects model. We assessed the certainty of the evidence for our two comparisons and our main outcomes of interest using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 30 studies with 1720 randomised participants that were conducted in 15 countries. Twenty-eight studies with 1366 participants contributed data to meta-analyses. Ten studies contributed data to long-term outcomes. Participants had dementia of varying degrees of severity and resided in institutions in most of the studies. Seven studies delivered an individual intervention; the other studies delivered the intervention to groups. Most interventions involved both active and receptive elements of musical experience. The studies were at high risk of performance bias and some were at high risk of detection or other bias. For music-based therapeutic interventions compared to usual care, we found moderate-certainty evidence that, at the end of treatment, music-based therapeutic interventions probably improved depressive symptoms slightly (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.42 to -0.04; 9 studies, 441 participants), and we found low-certainty evidence that it may have improved overall behavioural problems (SMD -0.31, 95% CI -0.60 to -0.02; 10 studies, 385 participants). We found moderate-certainty evidence that music-based therapeutic interventions likely did not improve agitation or aggression (SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.17; 11 studies, 503 participants). Low to very low certainty evidence showed that they did not improve emotional well-being (SMD 0.14, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.56; 4 studies, 154 participants), anxiety (SMD -0.15, 95% CI -0.39 to 0.09; 7 studies, 282 participants), social behaviour (SMD 0.22, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.57; 2 studies; 121 participants) or cognition (SMD 0.19, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.41; 7 studies, 353 participants). Low or very-low -certainty evidence showed that music-based therapeutic interventions may not have been more effective than usual care in the long term (four weeks or more after the end of treatment) for any of the outcomes. For music-based therapeutic interventions compared to other interventions, we found low-certainty evidence that, at the end of treatment, music-based therapeutic interventions may have been more effective than the other activities for social behaviour (SMD 0.52, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.96; 4 studies, 84 participants). We found very low-certainty evidence of a positive effect on anxiety (SMD -0.75, 95% CI -1.27 to -0.24; 10 studies, 291 participants). For all other outcomes, low-certainty evidence showed no evidence of an effect: emotional well-being (SMD 0.20, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.49; 9 studies, 298 participants); depressive symptoms (SMD -0.14, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.08; 10 studies, 359 participants); agitation or aggression (SMD 0.01, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.32; 6 studies, 168 participants); overall behavioural problems (SMD -0.08, 95% CI -0.33 to 0.17; 8 studies, 292 participants) and cognition (SMD 0.12, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.45; 5 studies; 147 participants). We found low or very-low certainty evidence that music-based therapeutic interventions may not have been more effective than other interventions in the long term (four weeks or more after the end of treatment) for any of the outcomes. Adverse effects were inconsistently measured or recorded, but no serious adverse events were reported.

Authors' Conclusions

When compared to usual care, providing people with dementia with at least five sessions of a music-based therapeutic intervention probably improves depressive symptoms and may improve overall behavioural problems at the end of treatment. When compared to other activities, music-based therapeutic interventions may improve social behaviour at the end of treatment. No conclusions can be reached about the outcome of anxiety as the certainty of the evidence is very low. There may be no effects on other outcomes at the end of treatment. There was no evidence of long-term effects from music-based therapeutic interventions. Adverse effects may be rare, but the studies were inconsistent in their reporting of adverse effects. Future studies should examine the duration of effects in relation to the overall duration of treatment and the number of sessions.

### Music therapy for people with autism spectrum disorder [^111qcwTd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The central impairments of people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affect social interaction and communication. Music therapy uses musical experiences and the relationships that develop through them to enable communication and expression, thus attempting to address some of the core problems of people with ASD. The present version of this review on music therapy for ASD is an update of the original Cochrane review published in 2006.

Objectives

To assess the effects of music therapy for individuals with ASD.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases in July 2013: CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, ASSIA, Sociological Abstracts, and Dissertation Abstracts International. We also checked the reference lists of relevant studies and contacted investigators in person.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials comparing music therapy or music therapy added to standard care to 'placebo' therapy, no treatment, or standard care for individuals with ASD were considered for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data from all included studies. We calculated the pooled standardised mean difference (SMD) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for continuous outcomes to allow the combination data from different scales and to facilitate the interpretation of effect sizes. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I² statistic. In cases of statistical heterogeneity within outcome subgroups, we examined clients' age, intensity of therapy (number and frequency of therapy sessions), and treatment approach as possible sources of heterogeneity.

Main Results

We included 10 studies (165 participants) that examined the short- and medium-term effect of music therapy interventions (one week to seven months) for children with ASD. Music was superior to 'placebo' therapy or standard care with respect to the primary outcomes social interaction within the therapy context (SMD 1.06, 95% CI 0.02 to 2.10, 1 RCT, n = 10); generalised social interaction outside of the therapy context (SMD 0.71, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.25, 3 RCTs, n = 57, moderate quality evidence), non-verbal communicative skills within the therapy context (SMD 0.57, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.85, 3 RCTs, n = 30), verbal communicative skills (SMD 0.33, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.49, 6 RCTs, n = 139), initiating behaviour (SMD 0.73, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.11, 3 RCTs, n = 22, moderate quality evidence), and social-emotional reciprocity (SMD 2.28, 95% CI 0.73 to 3.83, 1 RCT, n = 10, low quality evidence). There was no statistically significant difference in non-verbal communicative skills outside of the therapy context (SMD 0.48, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.98, 3 RCTs, n = 57, low quality evidence). Music therapy was also superior to 'placebo' therapy or standard care in secondary outcome areas, including social adaptation (SMD 0.41, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.60, 4 RCTs, n = 26), joy (SMD 0.96, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.88, 1 RCT, n = 10), and quality of parent-child relationships (SMD 0.82, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.52, 2 RCTs, n = 33, moderate quality evidence). None of the included studies reported any adverse effects. The small sample sizes of the studies limit the methodological strength of these findings.

Authors' Conclusions

The findings of this updated review provide evidence that music therapy may help children with ASD to improve their skills in primary outcome areas that constitute the core of the condition including social interaction, verbal communication, initiating behaviour, and social-emotional reciprocity. Music therapy may also help to enhance non-verbal communication skills within the therapy context. Furthermore, in secondary outcome areas, music therapy may contribute to increasing social adaptation skills in children with ASD and to promoting the quality of parent-child relationships. In contrast to the studies included in an earlier version of this review published in 2006, the new studies included in this update enhanced the applicability of findings to clinical practice. More research using larger samples and generalised outcome measures is needed to corroborate these findings and to examine whether the effects of music therapy are enduring. When applying the results of this review to practice, it is important to note that the application of music therapy requires specialised academic and clinical training.

### Music listening enhances cognitive recovery and mood after middle cerebral artery stroke [^112wT1pt]. Brain (2008). Low credibility.

We know from animal studies that a stimulating and enriched environment can enhance recovery after stroke, but little is known about the effects of an enriched sound environment on recovery from neural damage in humans. In humans, music listening activates a wide-spread bilateral network of brain regions related to attention, semantic processing, memory, motor functions, and emotional processing. Music exposure also enhances emotional and cognitive functioning in healthy subjects and in various clinical patient groups. The potential role of music in neurological rehabilitation, however, has not been systematically investigated. This single-blind, randomized, and controlled trial was designed to determine whether everyday music listening can facilitate the recovery of cognitive functions and mood after stroke. In the acute recovery phase, 60 patients with a left or right hemisphere middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke were randomly assigned to a music group, a language group, or a control group. During the following two months, the music and language groups listened daily to self-selected music or audio books, respectively, while the control group received no listening material. In addition, all patients received standard medical care and rehabilitation. All patients underwent an extensive neuropsychological assessment, which included a wide range of cognitive tests as well as mood and quality of life questionnaires, one week (baseline), 3 months, and 6 months after the stroke. Fifty-four patients completed the study. Results showed that recovery in the domains of verbal memory and focused attention improved significantly more in the music group than in the language and control groups. The music group also experienced less depressed and confused mood than the control group. These findings demonstrate for the first time that music listening during the early post-stroke stage can enhance cognitive recovery and prevent negative mood. The neural mechanisms potentially underlying these effects are discussed.

### Home-based neurologic music therapy for arm hemiparesis following stroke: results from a pilot, feasibility randomized controlled trial [^114Zhndx]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

For the cross-over analysis, data from only four time points were required to estimate the effectiveness of music therapy. The fifth data collection point is part of the overall data description, collected to observe for any changes in the waitlist group post intervention and washout. Statistical inferences cannot be made based on any of the data collected or the cross-over analysis from this study, as the sample was too much small. A calculation for a larger study could be made based on data from a larger arm rehabilitation trial that used the same outcome measures.

Determining appropriate, effective and acceptable rehabilitation interventions that can be delivered in home environments is of particular importance given the changes in healthcare delivery from hospital to home settings. Some participants in this study were able to associate the movements required to play through the exercises with activities of daily living, which possibly enhanced their adherence and focus. Performing the exercises in their homes may have helped with this, as they were surrounded by familiar materials and objects that they recognized as part of their everyday lives and understood the need to interact with them with improved precision and dexterity to optimize their independence. Treatments caused minimal disruption to daily routines since they did not require participants to leave their homes to receive them, and this may have increased compliance. These contextual and motivational variables combined with an intervention that facilitated high repetition of target movements warrant further investigation to determine quantitative patient benefits. Data collected on quality of life and an economic evaluation of treatment would be a useful addition to a future study, meeting current recommendation for research of this nature.

Clinical Messages

Therapeutic Instrumental Music Performance using the Action Research Arm Test to measure responses is feasible in different home environments
Treatment adherence twice weekly for six weeks suggests that the intervention may be motivating, possibly supporting high repetition of target movements

### Mental health and music engagement: review, framework, and guidelines for future studies [^113Dd23h]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Experimental studies

Randomized controlled trials have revealed that music interventions (including both music therapies administered by board-certified music therapists and other music interventions) are associated with reduced depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms. A review of 28 studies reported that 26 revealed significantly reduced depression levels in music intervention groups compared to control groups, including the 9 studies which included active non-music intervention control groups (e.g. reading sessions, "conductive-behavior" psychotherapy, antidepressant drugs). A similar meta-analysis of 19 studies demonstrated that music listening is effective at decreasing self-reported anxiety in healthy individuals. A review of music-based treatment studies related to PTSD revealed similar conclusions, though there were only four relevant studies. More recent studies confirm these findings, such as one randomized controlled trial that demonstrated reduced depression symptoms in older adults following musical improvisation exercises compared to an active control group (gentle gymnastic activities).

This work is promising given that some studies have observed effects even when compared to traditional behavior therapies. However, there are relatively few studies directly comparing music interventions to traditional therapies. Some music interventions incorporate components of other therapeutic methods in their programs including dialectic or cognitive behavior therapies, but few directly compare how the inclusion of music augments traditional behavioral therapy. Still other non-music therapies incorporate music into their practice (e.g. background music in mindfulness therapies), but the specific contribution of music in these approaches is unclear. Thus, there is a great need for further systematic research relating music to traditional therapies to understand which components of music interventions act on the same mechanisms as traditional therapies (e.g. developing coping mechanisms and building community) and which bolster or synchronize with other approaches (e.g. by adding structure, reinforcement, predictability, and social context to traditional approaches).

### Music-based interventions in palliative cancer care: a review of quantitative studies and neurobiological literature [^117T83ax]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Fig. 2
General conceptual model for the potentially therapeutic impact(s) of music-based interventions in cancer patients

In the absence of more RCTs with larger sample sizes, meta-analyses can provide useful quantitative assessments of impact. However, controlling for variation in study design, study population, specific intervention(s), and outcome assessment methods, presents enormous challenges. For example, different music therapists can introduce variability in outcomes, even when the same specific interventions are used. The data presented in the individual trials and the meta-analyses discussed in this review should therefore be considered preliminary and interpreted with caution. The statistical quality of the data in question remains diminished by high risk of bias, which almost invariably arises from the inherent difficulties associated with conventional blinding in music-based intervention studies. Furthermore, without reliable biomarkers for pain, anxiety, and depression, defining the "gold standard" in quantitative assessment of these outcomes remains formidable. Fortunately, the cost of music-based interventions remains relatively low, and breakthroughs in the field of neurobiology continue to advance our understanding of the anatomical and biochemical basis of how music works in the brain, and why symptoms such as pain, anxiety, and mood disturbance might be influenced.

Further investigation is warranted to determine (1) if certain subpopulations of cancer patients are more likely to respond to music-based interventions than others, (2) what interventions are most effective for such responsive patients, and (3) what measurement parameters best gauge their effectiveness. Greater collaboration between the fields of music therapy and music neuroscience may accelerate the pursuit of these objectives. Finally, given the emerging evidence that earlier involvement of palliative care may improve outcomes in certain cancer patients, and that psychological stress may be linked to up-regulation of inflammatory processes that promote tumor growth and angiogenesis, it follows that research into the potential of music to specifically promote relaxation and reduce stress, perhaps earlier in cancer's trajectory, may also be warranted.

### Music interventions for improving psychological and physical outcomes in people with cancer [^114qb3hp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

This is an update of the review published on the Cochrane Library in 2016, Issue 8. Having cancer may result in extensive emotional, physical and social suffering. Music interventions have been used to alleviate symptoms and treatment side effects in people with cancer. This review includes music interventions defined as music therapy offered by trained music therapists, as well as music medicine, which was defined as listening to pre-recorded music offered by medical staff.

Objectives

To assess and compare the effects of music therapy and music medicine interventions for psychological and physical outcomes in people with cancer.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2020, Issue 3) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE via Ovid, Embase via Ovid, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS, Science Citation Index, CancerLit, CAIRSS, Proquest Digital Dissertations, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, the RILM Abstracts of Music Literature, http://www.wfmt.info/Musictherapyworld/ and the National Research Register. We searched all databases, except for the last two, from their inception to April 2020; the other two are no longer functional, so we searched them until their termination date. We handsearched music therapy journals, reviewed reference lists and contacted experts. There was no language restriction.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials of music interventions for improving psychological and physical outcomes in adults and pediatric patients with cancer. We excluded patients undergoing biopsy and aspiration for diagnostic purposes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias. Where possible, we presented results in meta-analyses using mean differences and standardized mean differences. We used post-test scores. In cases of significant baseline difference, we used change scores. We conducted separate meta-analyses for studies with adult participants and those with pediatric participants. Primary outcomes of interest included psychological outcomes and physical symptoms and secondary outcomes included physiological responses, physical functioning, anesthetic and analgesic intake, length of hospitalization, social and spiritual support, communication, and quality of life (QoL). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We identified 29 new trials for inclusion in this update. In total, the evidence of this review rests on 81 trials with a total of 5576 participants. Of the 81 trials, 74 trials included adult (N = 5306) and seven trials included pediatric (N = 270) oncology patients. We categorized 38 trials as music therapy trials and 43 as music medicine trials. The interventions were compared to standard care. Psychological outcomes The results suggest that music interventions may have a large anxiety-reducing effect in adults with cancer, with a reported average anxiety reduction of 7.73 units (17 studies, 1381 participants; 95% confidence interval (CI) -10.02 to -5.44; very low-certainty evidence) on the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory scale (range 20 to 80; lower values reflect lower anxiety). Results also suggested a moderately strong, positive impact of music interventions on depression in adults (12 studies, 1021 participants; standardized mean difference (SMD): -0.41, 95% CI -0.67 to -0.15; very low-certainty evidence). We found no support for an effect of music interventions on mood (SMD 0.47, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.97; 5 studies, 236 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Music interventions may increase hope in adults with cancer, with a reported average increase of 3.19 units (95% CI 0.12 to 6.25) on the Herth Hope Index (range 12 to 48; higher scores reflect greater hope), but this finding was based on only two studies (N = 53 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Physical outcomes We found a moderate pain-reducing effect of music interventions (SMD -0.67, 95% CI -1.07 to -0.26; 12 studies, 632 adult participants; very low-certainty evidence). In addition, music interventions had a small treatment effect on fatigue (SMD -0.28, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.10; 10 studies, 498 adult participants; low-certainty evidence). The results suggest a large effect of music interventions on adult participants' QoL, but the results were highly inconsistent across studies, and the pooled effect size was accompanied by a large confidence interval (SMD 0.88, 95% CI -0.31 to 2.08; 7 studies, 573 participants; evidence is very uncertain). Removal of studies that used improper randomization methods resulted in a moderate effect size that was less heterogeneous (SMD 0.47, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.88, P = 0.02, I² = 56%). A small number of trials included pediatric oncology participants. The findings suggest that music interventions may reduce anxiety but this finding was based on only two studies (SMD -0.94, 95% CI -1.9 to 0.03; very low-certainty evidence). Due to the small number of studies, we could not draw conclusions regarding the effects of music interventions on mood, depression, QoL, fatigue or pain in pediatric participants with cancer. The majority of studies included in this review update presented a high risk of bias, and therefore the overall certainty of the evidence is low. For several outcomes (i.e. anxiety, depression, pain, fatigue, and QoL) the beneficial treatment effects were consistent across studies for music therapy interventions delivered by music therapists. In contrast, music medicine interventions resulted in inconsistent treatment effects across studies for these outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

This systematic review indicates that music interventions compared to standard care may have beneficial effects on anxiety, depression, hope, pain, and fatigue in adults with cancer. The results of two trials suggest that music interventions may have a beneficial effect on anxiety in children with cancer. Too few trials with pediatric participants were included to draw conclusions about the treatment benefits of music for other outcomes. For several outcomes, music therapy interventions delivered by a trained music therapist led to consistent results across studies and this was not the case for music medicine interventions. Moreover, evidence of effect was found for music therapy interventions for QoL and fatigue but not for music medicine interventions. Most trials were at high risk of bias and low or very low certainty of evidence; therefore, these results need to be interpreted with caution.

### AIR: advances in respiration-music therapy in the treatment of chronic pulmonary disease [^116HGNKJ]. Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The aim of this randomized control study is to examine the effect of a multimodal psycho-music therapy intervention on respiratory symptoms, psychological well-being and quality of life of patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and other lung diseases as adjunct to Pulmonary Rehabilitation with a design of music therapy plus PR compared to Pulmonary Rehabilitation alone. Music therapy group treatment including music visualization, wind playing and singing was provided weekly. This was compared with standard care treatment. Adults ages 48 to 88 (mean 70.1) with moderate to severe GOLD stage II-IV lung disease as well as other diseases processes that lead to chronic airflow limitations were included (n = 98). Participants in both conditions were followed from baseline enrollment to six weeks post control/treatment. Outcome measures included the Beck Depression Inventory Scale 2nd edition-Fast Screen (BDI-FS), Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire Self-Reported (CRQ-SR), and Dyspnea Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Results showed improvement in symptoms of depression (LS mean -0.2) in the music therapy group with statistical divergence between groups (p = 0.007). The CRQ-SR demonstrated improvement in dyspnea (p = 0.01 LS mean 0.5) and mastery (p = 0.06 LS mean 0.5) in the music therapy group and fatigue (p = 0.01 LS mean 0.3). VAS demonstrated highly significant effect in the music therapy group between weeks 5 and 6 (p < 0.001). The findings of this study suggest that music therapy combined with standard PR may prove to be an effective modality in the management of pulmonary disease.

### Music therapy for depression [^115qRh8H]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Depression is a highly prevalent mood disorder that is characterised by persistent low mood, diminished interest, and loss of pleasure. Music therapy may be helpful in modulating moods and emotions. An update of the 2008 Cochrane review was needed to improve knowledge on effects of music therapy for depression.

Objectives

1. To assess effects of music therapy for depression in people of any age compared with treatment as usual (TAU) and psychological, pharmacological, and/or other therapies.2. To compare effects of different forms of music therapy for people of any age with a diagnosis of depression.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMD-CTR; from inception to 6 May 2016); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; to 17 June 2016); Thomson Reuters/Web of Science (to 21 June 2016); Ebsco/PsycInfo, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Embase, and PubMed (to 5 July 2016); the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov, the National Guideline Clearing House, and OpenGrey (to 6 September 2016); and the Digital Access to Research Theses (DART)-Europe E-theses Portal, Open Access Theses and Dissertations, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Database (to 7 September 2016). We checked reference lists of retrieved articles and relevant systematic reviews and contacted trialists and subject experts for additional information when needed. We updated this search in August 2017 and placed potentially relevant studies in the "Awaiting classification" section; we will incorporate these into the next version of this review as appropriate.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) comparing music therapy versus treatment as usual (TAU), psychological therapies, pharmacological therapies, other therapies, or different forms of music therapy for reducing depression.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data from all included studies. We calculated standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data and odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous data with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed heterogeneity using the I 2 statistic.

Main Results

We included in this review nine studies involving a total of 421 participants, 411 of whom were included in the meta-analysis examining short-term effects of music therapy for depression. Concerning primary outcomes, we found moderate-quality evidence of large effects favouring music therapy and TAU over TAU alone for both clinician-rated depressive symptoms (SMD -0.98, 95% CI -1.69 to -0.27, 3 RCTs, 1 CCT, n = 219) and patient-reported depressive symptoms (SMD -0.85, 95% CI -1.37 to -0.34, 3 RCTs, 1 CCT, n = 142). Music therapy was not associated with more or fewer adverse events than TAU. Regarding secondary outcomes, music therapy plus TAU was superior to TAU alone for anxiety and functioning. Music therapy and TAU was not more effective than TAU alone for improved quality of life (SMD 0.32, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.80, P = 0.20, n = 67, low-quality evidence). We found no significant discrepancies in the numbers of participants who left the study early (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.70, P = 0.26, 5 RCTs, 1 CCT, n = 293, moderate-quality evidence). Findings of the present meta-analysis indicate that music therapy added to TAU provides short-term beneficial effects for people with depression if compared to TAU alone. Additionally, we are uncertain about the effects of music therapy versus psychological therapies on clinician-rated depression (SMD -0.78, 95% CI -2.36 to 0.81, 1 RCT, n = 11, very low-quality evidence), patient-reported depressive symptoms (SMD -1.28, 95% CI -3.75 to 1.02, 4 RCTs, n = 131, low-quality evidence), quality of life (SMD -1.31, 95% CI - 0.36 to 2.99, 1 RCT, n = 11, very low-quality evidence), and leaving the study early (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.49, 4 RCTs, n = 157, moderate-quality evidence). We found no eligible evidence addressing adverse events, functioning, and anxiety. We do not know whether one form of music therapy is better than another for clinician-rated depressive symptoms (SMD -0.52, 95% CI -1.87 to 0.83, 1 RCT, n = 9, very low-quality evidence), patient-reported depressive symptoms (SMD -0.01, 95% CI -1.33 to 1.30, 1 RCT, n = 9, very low-quality evidence), quality of life (SMD -0.24, 95% CI -1.57 to 1.08, 1 RCT, n = 9, very low-quality evidence), or leaving the study early (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.46, 1 RCT, n = 10). We found no eligible evidence addressing adverse events, functioning, or anxiety.

Authors' Conclusions

Findings of the present meta-analysis indicate that music therapy provides short-term beneficial effects for people with depression. Music therapy added to treatment as usual (TAU) seems to improve depressive symptoms compared with TAU alone. Additionally, music therapy plus TAU is not associated with more or fewer adverse events than TAU alone. Music therapy also shows efficacy in decreasing anxiety levels and improving functioning of depressed individuals. Future trials based on adequate design and larger samples of children and adolescents are needed to consolidate our findings. Researchers should consider investigating mechanisms of music therapy for depression. It is important to clearly describe music therapy, TAU, the comparator condition, and the profession of the person who delivers the intervention, for reproducibility and comparison purposes.

### Music and medicine: promoting harmony for health [^112hGCPz]. The American Journal of Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

A multitude of clinical trials measuring hemodynamic and psychological parameters have shown the beneficial effects of music on health. However, there are no clear instructions on how to utilize the potential benefits of music to improve health outcomes. Moreover, whether the effect of music is transient or enduring has yet to be determined. To address the effect of music on vital parameters and emotional well-being of patients we provide an overview of methods and findings of some studies that have evaluated the physiological or psychological impacts of music. This review puts forward a proposed model for fostering an individualized approach that can examine the therapeutic effects of music.

### The use of music playlists for people with dementia: a critical synthesis [^1148c9Gk]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Questions also exist over whether people with different types of dementia respond to music in the same way. Behavioral and psychiatric symptoms tend to differ between different forms of dementia, with people with dementia with Lewy bodies for example, tending to experience greater agitation and anxiety than those with Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia, while those with Alzheimer's disease might have greater impairments of short-term memory than people with other forms of dementia. We could thus expect that people with different forms of dementia would not only have different therapeutic needs, but also may respond to music differently. This has not been explored in previous reviews however.

The aim of the current review, therefore, is to examine evidence of the effectiveness of using pre-recorded music to reduce the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, as well as to explore the influence of other variables such as the type of dementia of the patients involved and the details of the music intervention itself. This will help to clarify the usefulness of playlist interventions for people with dementia, and to identify further areas requiring future investigation.

Research question

1 How useful are music interventions using pre-recorded music in addressing psychological and behavioral symptoms in people with dementia?
2 Do other variables such as the type of dementia involved, the presence of a therapist, the type of music played or the setting in which it was played have an influence on the impact of playlist interventions?

### Person-centered care in persons living with dementia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114dyb7n]. The Gerontologist (2022). Medium credibility.

Moreover, our results emphasized that music and reminiscence therapies were effective in improving MMSE scores, namely, the cognitive function of people living with dementia. This is in line with the finding that music stimulates a number of brain regions and can help with cognitive rehabilitation; additionally, remembering and discussing past events (i.e. core components of reminiscence therapy) could be beneficial for the rehabilitation of cognitive function of persons living with dementia.

Our results also showed that music and reminiscence therapies were effective in decreasing depression, whereas cognitive therapy and multisensory stimulation did not show statistically significant effects on depression. This between-intervention difference may owe to what each intervention type focused on; for example, music and reminiscence therapies have their main procedures intricately related to individuals'/patients' values and preferences (e.g. listing their preferred songs or creating opportunities to communicate about one's good memories), and such characteristics have been shown to help people relax and improve their moods. These cited studies confirm our results that show significant effects for these two types of therapy. Conversely, cognitive therapy might not focus on the mood or feelings of persons living with dementia because it is usually designed to enhance cognitive function, and the multisensory stimulation studies in our review had a relatively smaller scale compared to the others, which might have influenced the nonsignificant results. Furthermore, music therapy was the only intervention type that was effective to reduce neuropsychiatric symptoms, indicating that listening to a preferred music can promote relaxation.

Studies and key features

RCT, randomized controlled trial; MT, music therapy; ML, music listening; C, control; AD, Alzheimer's disease.

A diverse range of study designs were used in the reviewed studies including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with parallel treatment groups (n = 7, 25%), an RCT with a cross-over design within the treatment group and a parallel control group (n = 1, 4%), controlled experiments with cluster randomization (n = 2, 7%), controlled experiments with parallel treatment groups but no randomization (n = 2, 7%), crossover designs with randomization of the order of conditions (n = 2, 7%), crossover designs with a standard order for conditions (n = 8, 29%), single group experiments with a pre-post design (n = 3, 11%), single group experiments with continuous observation (n = 2, 7%), and a single case crossover design (n = 1, 4%). Thus only 10 studies in total (36%) had both a control group or condition, and some kind of randomization included in the design (Table 2). Of the seven studies that used RCTs with parallel treatment groups, two compared similar interventions or used comparable outcome measures. Since the aim of our review was both to look at the effect of various interventions on particular psychological and behavioral symptoms, as well as to look at the relative influence of other variables, multiple studies that compared similar interventions under similar conditions would have been required to conduct a meta-analysis. Thus, it was decided that insufficient comparable studies were available for the purposes of a meta-analysis in this instance.

### Long-term improvements after multimodal rehabilitation in late phase after stroke: a randomized controlled trial [^1124RqFp]. Stroke (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Treatments that improve function in late phase after stroke are urgently needed. We assessed whether multimodal interventions based on rhythm-and-music therapy or horse-riding therapy could lead to increased perceived recovery and functional improvement in a mixed population of individuals in late phase after stroke.

Methods

Participants were assigned to rhythm-and-music therapy, horse-riding therapy, or control using concealed randomization, stratified with respect to sex and stroke laterality. Therapy was given twice a week for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was change in participants' perception of stroke recovery as assessed by the Stroke Impact Scale with an intention-to-treat analysis. Secondary objective outcome measures were changes in balance, gait, grip strength, and cognition. Blinded assessments were performed at baseline, postintervention, and at 3- and 6-month follow-up.

Results

One hundred twenty-three participants were assigned to rhythm-and-music therapy (n = 41), horse-riding therapy (n = 41), or control (n = 41). Post-intervention, the perception of stroke recovery (mean change from baseline on a scale ranging from 1 to 100) was higher among rhythm-and-music therapy (5.2 [95% confidence interval, 0.79–9.61]) and horse-riding therapy participants (9.8 [95% confidence interval, 6.00–13.66]), compared with controls (-0.5 [-3.20 to 2.28]); P = 0.001 (1-way ANOVA). The improvements were sustained in both intervention groups 6 months later, and corresponding gains were observed for the secondary outcomes.

Conclusions

Multimodal interventions can improve long-term perception of recovery, as well as balance, gait, grip strength, and working memory in a mixed population of individuals in late phase after stroke.

### Enriched music-supported therapy for individuals with chronic stroke: a randomized controlled trial [^113dqroN]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Many stroke survivors still present with upper-limb paresis six months post-stroke, impacting their autonomy and quality of life (QoL). We designed an enriched Music-supported Therapy (eMST) program to reduce disability in this population. We evaluated the eMST's effectiveness in improving functional abilities and QoL in chronic stroke individuals compared to the conventional motor program Graded Repetitive Arm Supplementary Program (GRASP).

Methods

We conducted a pragmatic two-arm parallel-group randomized controlled trial with a 3-month follow-up and masked assessment. The eMST involved playing instruments during individual self-administered and group music therapy sessions. The GRASP consisted of self-administered motor exercises using daily objects. Both interventions were completed at home with telemonitoring and involved four one-hour weekly sessions for 10 weeks. The primary outcome was upper-limb motor function measured with the Action Research Arm Test. Secondary outcomes included motor impairment, daily life motor performance, cognitive functions, emotional well-being, QoL, self-regulation, and self-efficacy. Intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses were conducted including participants who discontinued the intervention and those who completed it entirely, respectively.

Results

Fifty-eight chronic stroke patients were randomized to the eMST-group (n = 26; age: 64.2 ± 12.5; 6 [23.1%] females; 2.8 ± 2.9 years post-stroke), and the control group (n = 32; age: 62.2 ± 12; 8 [25%] females; 1.8 ± 6.2 years post-stroke). The eMST-group had more participants achieving a clinically relevant improvement in motor impairment post-intervention than the control group for the ITT (55% vs 21.6%; OR = 4.5 (95% CI 1.4–14); p = .019) and PP analyses (60% vs 20%; OR = 6 (95% CI 1.5–24.7); p = .024), sustained at follow-up. The eMST-group reported greater improvements in emotion (difference = 11.1 (95% CI 0.8–21.5; p = 0.36) and participation (difference = 10.3 (95% CI 0.6–25.9); p = 0.41) subscales of QoL, and higher enjoyment during the sessions (difference = 1 (95% CI 0.3–1.5); p = 0.12). No changes were found in other outcomes.

Conclusion

eMST demonstrated superiority over conventional motor rehabilitation program in enhancing upper-limb functions and QoL in chronic stroke individuals.

### Effects of music therapy on cognition, quality of life, and neuropsychiatric symptoms of patients with dementia: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^117LVywo]. Psychiatry Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Dementia is a major cause of disability and dependency. Pharmacological interventions are commonly provided to patients with dementia to delay the deterioration of cognitive functions but cannot alter the course of disease. Nonpharmacological interventions are now attracting increasing scholarly interest. In accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement, we aim to assess the effectiveness of music-based therapies on the cognition, quality of life (QoL), and neuropsychiatric symptoms of patients with dementia through a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched for reports of RCTs examining the effectiveness of music-based therapies for dementia published as of April 2023. A total of 674 articles were screened, and 22 trials from 21 studies (1780 patients) met the eligibility criteria. In 15 trials, music-based therapies significantly improved the cognition of patients with dementia compared with non-music therapies. In 11 trials, music-based therapies also significantly improved the QoL of patients with dementia compared with non-music therapies. In six trials, music-based therapies significantly improved patients' neuropsychiatric symptoms compared with non-music therapies. In conclusion, music-based therapy is recognized as a safe and effective alternative approach for patients with dementia.

### Person-centered care in persons living with dementia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113ykGg5]. The Gerontologist (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our results underlined that various types of person-centered interventions have been applied to reduce BPSD or improve cognitive function of persons living with dementia in the past two decades (i.e. from 1998 to 2019). They also showed that person-centered interventions can be effective to decrease BPSD in the studied population. We recommend that health care providers utilize person-centered care as an essential part of the treatment when trying to reduce the BPSD and rehabilitate the cognitive function of persons living with dementia. Specifically, given that reminiscence therapy was effective on both BPSD and cognitive function and that its effect size was superior to that of other interventions (i.e. cognitive and music therapy and multisensory stimulation), we suggest this type of therapy as the first choice of nonpharmacological intervention that should be applied to manage BPSD and maintain the cognitive function of our population of interest.

### Music therapy for people with dementia [^113doLxH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Dementia is a clinical syndrome with a number of different causes which is characterised by deterioration in cognitive functions. Research is pursuing a variety of promising findings for the treatment of dementia. Pharmacological interventions are available but have limited ability to treat many of the syndrome's features. Little research has been directed towards non-pharmacological treatments. In this review the evidence for music therapy as a treatment is examined.

Objectives

To assess the effects of music therapy in the treatment of behavioural, social, cognitive and emotional problems of older people with dementia.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG) Specialised Register was searched on 30 June 2003 using the term "music". This Register contains records from all major health care databases and many ongoing trial databases and is updated regularly. The principal reviewer conducted additional searches to retrieve randomised controlled trials (RCTs) concerning the effect of music therapy on older people with dementia.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials that reported clinically relevant outcomes associated with music therapy in treatment of behavioural, social, cognitive and emotional problems of older people with dementia.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers screened retrieved studies independently for methodological quality using a checklist. Data from accepted studies were independently extracted by the reviewers.

Main Results

Five studies were included. The methodological quality of the studies was generally poor and the study results could not be validated or pooled for further analyses.

Reviewers' Conclusions

The methodological quality and the reporting of the included studies were too poor to draw any useful conclusions.

### Efficacy of music therapy as a non-pharmacological measure to support Alzheimer's disease patients: a systematic review [^111KjN5j]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Quality assessment

We used Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) to grade the evidence confidence of systematic reviews. The system is widely used in medicine and public health and is a consistent and transparent approach. The assessment tool classifies paper quality into three levels: high, medium and low, comprising 15 items, with the entire assessment tool worth 19 points. The two researchers used the system to rank articles and resolve disagreements to reach a consensus.

### Music-based interventions for people with chronic kidney disease undergoing haemodialysis [^1143rE8y]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Description of the intervention and how it might work

A music‐based intervention can be classified as either active (e.g. creating music, playing an instrument, singing, or musical improvisation) or receptive (e.g. music listening). Music‐based interventions to improve health and well‐being can be broadly grouped into the following five categories: 1) music therapy, 2) music medicine, 3) health musicians, 4) music as health promotion, and 5) music as diversion/entertainment. "Music therapy" is a specialised treatment method for mental and physical disorders delivered by a trained music therapist. Music therapists perform various tasks such as a) treating individual patients with specific needs, b) designing group interventions, c) creating therapeutic environments, and d) advising and training staff on incorporating music interventions and music medicine into daily practices in institutions or hospitals. "Music medicine" involves the use of music, either live or via specialised equipment, to support patients in hospitals, outpatients, or individuals in other healthcare institutions. It is applied in treatment, rehabilitation, and palliative care settings. "Health musicians" are professional musicians who perform live, personalised music to bring joy, engagement, and enhance the QoL for patients in hospitals and care centres. Unlike music therapy or music medicine, performances by health musicians are not designed with a specific treatment goal. However, these performances can still have therapeutic effects if patients are receptive to the experience. This growing field, similar to hospital clowns, is self‐regulating and usually operates entirely on private funding. "Music as health promotion" involves the integration of music experiences alongside other cultural experiences such as art, theatre, or dance in a community‐based context to promote health. Music as health promotion is not intended as a treatment for specific conditions but is based on the understanding that cultural experiences and engagement in art can positively influence well‐being. Finally, "music as distraction or entertainment" is used in hospitals and care settings to address the ambience of the healthcare environment. This type of music‐based intervention may employ more technical solutions, such as mobile applications (Apps) specifically designed for inpatients and people with dementia. It may also involve music that has been composed with specific goals in mind, such as music for wakefulness regulation.

### Mild asthmatics benefit from music therapy [^117CigLT]. The Journal of Asthma (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of pulmonary rehabilitation with music therapy in patients with asthma.

Methods

Seventy-six selected inpatients (54 women and 22 men; mean age = 56.4 years; SD = 11.8) with stable asthma underwent pulmonary rehabilitation in two groups: standard versus music therapy.

Results

After the intervention, an increase in analyzed spirometric values (forced expiratory volume at the first second (FEV(1)), FEV(1) as a percentage of vital capacity (FEV(1) % FVC), forced expiratory flow at 25%, 50%, and 75% of vital capacity (FEF(25), FEF(50), and FEF(75), respectively), and peak expiratory flow) was observed in both the groups (p < .05) but without any intergroup differences (p > .05). A greater increase of mean FEV(1) % FVC, FEF(50), and FEF(75) values was observed only in the patients with mild asthma from the music therapy group (p < .05). In both the groups, a dyspnea reduction was noted (p < .001). However, it was influenced neither by the type of rehabilitation nor by the gender (p > .05), but the interaction of these variables was significant (p = .044). A dyspnea reduction was observed in women in both the groups (p < .001) and in men in the music therapy group only (p = .001). A change in the value of anxiety (6.43, SD = 7.73) on the 10th day compared with the first day of the study was noticed (p < .001). However, this change was not influenced by the type of rehabilitation, gender, or a combination of these two variables (p > .05).

Conclusion

Music therapy improves the respiratory function in patients with mild asthma and reduces dyspnea mainly in men with asthma.

### The effect of music therapy on cognitive functions in patients with dementia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114FTQ4G]. Aging & Mental Health (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of the present study was to meta-analyze the effect of music therapy (MT) on cognitive functions in patients with dementia.

Method

A systematic literature search was performed in Medline, PsycINFO, Embase, CINAHL and RILM up to 8 September 2016. We included all randomized controlled trials that compared MT with standard care, or other non-musical types of intervention, evaluating cognitive outcomes in patients with dementia. Outcomes included global cognition, complex attention, executive function, learning and memory, language, and perceptual-motor skills.

Results

From 1089 potentially relevant records, 110 studies were assessed for eligibility, and 7 met the inclusion criteria, of which 6 contained appropriate data for meta-analysis (330 participants, mean age range 78.8–86.3). Overall, random-effects meta-analyses suggested no significant effects of MT on all outcomes. Subgroup analysis found evidence of a beneficial effect of active MT on global cognition (SMD = 0.29, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.57, p = 0.04).

Conclusion

Despite the limited evidence of the present review, it is important to continue supporting MT as a complementary treatment for older adults with dementia. RCTs with larger sample sizes are needed to better elucidate the impact of MT on cognitive functions.

### European Stroke Organisation and European Academy of Neurology joint guidelines on post-stroke cognitive impairment [^113wuuro]. European Stroke Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Analysis of the current evidence

For the purpose of the present guidelines, we define cognitive rehabilitation as an individualised, structured set of therapeutic activities designed to restore domain-specific cognitive impairments (e.g. attention, visuospatial processing, memory and executive functions) or global cognitive impairment, or overcome these cognitive impairments by means of compensation (e.g. adaptive strategies and assistive devices). Generally, cognitive rehabilitation includes a combination of restorative and compensatory approaches. The ultimate goal of cognitive rehabilitation is minimising the impact of cognitive impairments on personally relevant aspects of everyday functioning for both the affected individuals and their families.

Given the potential variation in the activities that could be considered as relevant to the cognitive rehabilitation rubric, we pre-specified a list of non-pharmacological interventions that could be considered in the management of post-stroke cognitive impairments but were not considered in this cognitive rehabilitation review. This is an approach that has been used in previous systematic reviews of cognitive rehabilitation. We considered that interventions exclusively targeting communication, reading, writing and calculation disorders fall outside the scope of the present guidelines, and they are not considered here. Furthermore, we decided to exclude disease self-management/coping interventions, cognitive-motor dual task training, physical training, community reintegration, vocational rehabilitation, patient and caregiver education, neurosensory stimulation (i.e. Snoezelen therapy), nutritional supplements, music-based therapy/instrument playing, art therapy, mindfulness-based interventions, yoga, qigong, acupuncture, non-invasive brain stimulation and cognitive behavioural therapy delivered in isolation or as part of multimodal interventions. We acknowledge that some or all of these interventions might – directly or indirectly – benefit cognitive functioning and therefore could be considered in future versions of these guidelines.

### Uncovering potential distinctive acoustic features of healing music [^1125MC1N]. General Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Mental health issues such as depression, anxiety and stress have become increasingly prevalent. Although many treatment options are available, including medication and psychotherapy, music has emerged as a powerful tool for emotional relief. Many people use music to cope with challenging emotions. Clinically proven music therapy has been found to be an effective intervention approach for a wide range of mental health issues. Music therapy involves using music to address emotional, cognitive and social needs and has been shown to help reduce symptoms of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder.

In clinics, music therapists use a range of techniques, including playing instruments, singing and listening to music, to address the physical and emotional needs of their clients. Music therapy approaches can be divided into two main types based on how music is employed: active and receptive. Active music therapy involves patients actively participating in the music-making process, whereas receptive music therapy entails patients listening mainly to therapist-selected music pieces. These two approaches have widespread application in clinical practice. Compared with the active method, the receptive approach is relatively more feasible and cost-effective, particularly given recent social distancing measures. Furthermore, the receptive method is flexible and suitable for patients of all ages with varying psychological and physical capabilities. Regardless of the music therapy approach, music plays an essential role as the principal means for promoting emotional and cognitive expression, relaxation and connection. In receptive music therapy, carefully selecting appropriate music pieces is crucial for efficacy.

### Structural and functional neuroplasticity in music and dance-based rehabilitation: a systematic review [^113LJf4G]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Stroke

Passive music listening was primarily directed at individuals who had acute stroke. while singing was used in chronic post-stroke aphasia. Four studies reported secondary analyses of the same RCT, which showed significant effects of music listening on language and verbal memory recovery. These studies revealed GMV increases in left and right frontal regions, anterior cingulate cortex, and ventral striatum in patients with left hemisphere lesions. Notably, these changes in GMV correlated with language, verbal memory, and attention recovery. Moreover, increment in GMV in the left insula in patients with right hemisphere lesions, correlated with language improvement. Enhancements of FA and QA as indicators of the integrity of white matter pathways (FAT, AF, SLF, corpus callosum, and CST) were observed in both acute and chronic stroke. These pathways are essential for facilitating communication between hemispheres and regions involved in language and motor function.

Functional neuroplasticity biomarkers were also associated with music listening interventions, and rhythmic-melodic voice training, showing increased activation in left frontal areas and enhanced FC within language network areas. Moreover, activity in the left parietal areas, bilateral medial frontal areas, and bilateral auditory network areas predicted language recovery and verbal memory skills.

In the two studies on patients with chronic post-stroke aphasia, the music-based treatment had the same duration but differed in intensity. Neuroplasticity effects were observed only in the study with higher intensity suggesting that intensity plays a role in driving long-term neural reorganization. The language improvements reported in these two studies align with the findings of the recent meta-analysis by, which concluded that music therapy significantly enhances functional communication, repetition, and naming in patients with post-stroke aphasia. However, the results of study also indicate an improvement in comprehension, which was not found to be significant in the aforementioned meta-analysis. Once again, it is important to note that the sample size in Jungblut's study was very small, and it cannot be ruled out that the participants may have differed in terms of aphasia severity or other characteristics compared to those analyzed in the meta-analysis.

### Music therapy enhances executive functions and prefrontal structural neuroplasticity after traumatic brain injury: evidence from a randomized controlled trial [^116S15vC]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2020). Medium credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes lifelong cognitive deficits, particularly impairments of executive functioning (EF). Musical training and music-based rehabilitation have been shown to enhance cognitive functioning and neuroplasticity, but the potential rehabilitative effects of music in TBI are still largely unknown. The aim of the present crossover randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to determine the clinical efficacy of music therapy on cognitive functioning in TBI and to explore its neural basis. Using an AB/BA design, 40 patients with moderate or severe TBI were randomized to receive a 3-month neurological music therapy intervention either during the first (AB, n = 20) or second (BA, n = 20) half of a 6-month follow-up period. Neuropsychological and motor testing and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed at baseline and at the 3-month and 6-month stage. Thirty-nine subjects who participated in baseline measurement were included in an intention-to-treat analysis using multiple imputation. Results showed that general EF (as indicated by the Frontal Assessment Battery [FAB]) and set shifting improved more in the AB group than in the BA group over the first 3-month period and the effect on general EF was maintained in the 6-month follow-up. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis of the structural MRI data indicated that gray matter volume (GMV) in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) increased significantly in both groups during the intervention versus control period, which also correlated with cognitive improvement in set shifting. These findings suggest that neurological music therapy enhances EF and induces fine-grained neuroanatomical changes in prefrontal areas.

### Structural and functional neuroplasticity in music and dance-based rehabilitation: a systematic review [^1147WZUh]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Other neurological diseases

Two studies, related to the same RCT, reported on interventions using active musical production in patients with TBI. Behaviorally, the music-based intervention had a significant impact on the recovery of EF, aligning with a recent meta-analysis that confirms the importance of music in treating EF deficits — an aspect of critical relevance in this type of pathology.

Structural neuroplasticity was shown as an increment of GMV in right frontal areas, left fusiform, and cerebellum, while Martínez-Molina et al. reported a decrement in FC between DMN and sensory network, and within the FPN and SAL. Furthermore, improvement in general EF after training was correlated with a reduction in connectivity within the FPN and between the DMN and SMN. These data, in agreement with a previous work, suggest a shifting from a compensatory hyperconnected state to a sensory-integrative functioning related to music-based intervention.

One study reported on passive live music listening in a small number of patients with MCS. Increment in the GCS in patients compared to the control group was reported, together with a qualitative evaluation of FA in several WM bundles related to the ascending reticular activation system.

The last study demonstrated that music intervention outperformed standard respiratory physiotherapy in improving respiratory function outcomes. However, DWI biomarkers were qualitatively reported, indicating increased FA, FN, and path length in connectivity in areas associated with respiratory movements.

### Toward a theory-based specification of non-pharmacological treatments in aging and dementia: focused reviews and methodological recommendations [^1171v7yL]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2021). Medium credibility.

3.8 | Music-based treatments

Music-based treatments are classified as active or receptive musical activities that aim to address multiple non-musical outcomes (eg, cognitive, psychosocial, communication, and physical goals), often simultaneously. Active treatments include instrument playing, singing, songwriting, and moving to music. Receptive treatments involve listening to recorded or live music. Music therapy treatments (goal-based therapeutic musical interaction with a trained therapist), are distinguished from music activities that can be implemented by other clinicians, caregivers, or self-administered. A recent Cochrane review summarized the effect of multiple RCTs examining both active and receptive music treatments and reported evidence for reductions in depression and overall behavioral problems, but no effect on agitation, and low-quality evidence for reductions in anxiety and quality of life and little to no effect on cognition. For other areas, such as anxiety and social behavior, the Cochrane review found not enough evidence to determine effects. Other recent reviews have found evidence that music therapy is effective in reducing agitation, anxiety, depression, and other neuropsychiatric symptoms. – There is disagreement between some published meta-analyses on whether active or receptive treatments are more effective for specific outcomes. The low quality of the current evidence highlights that improvements for future research are necessary, most specifically improving design quality and comparing different music-based treatments (receptive versus active) and dosage (see Text S10 and RTSS Table S8 in supporting information).

3.9 | Communication treatments

Communication interventions target a construct referred to as "quality of communication life", defined as the extent to which a person's communication acts allow a meaningful participation in life situations. Communication treatments aim to maintain or improve quality and quantity of meaningful communication interactions. These treatments can be divided into direct and indirect treatments. Direct treatments are primarily language stimulation tasks and activities, delivered individually or in groups. Indirect treatments include training family and professional carers in strategies for effective communication, modifying environments to facilitate communication, and developing therapeutic routines and activities that promote communication. A current challenge is the tendency for late (or no) recognition of communication problems in MCI and dementia. The level of evidence is currently limited due to a lack of controlled studies, and future efforts should focus on this (see Text S11 and RTSS Table S9 in supporting information).

### Association of music interventions with health-related quality of life: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115HkK7R]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

This study provided moderate-quality quantitative evidence of associations between music interventions and clinically significant changes in mental HRQOL. Mean differences in physical HRQOL associated with music interventions were potentially equivocal. Changes in mental HRQOL associated with music interventions were within the range, albeit at the low end, of average effects of established non–pharmaceutical and medical interventions (eg, exercise, weight loss). Substantial individual variation in music intervention effects precluded conclusions regarding music use in specific scenarios. Future research is needed to clarify optimal music interventions and doses for use in specific clinical and public health scenarios.

### Amplifying walking activity in Parkinson's disease through autonomous music-based rhythmic auditory stimulation: randomized controlled trial [^116thGn9]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Improving walking is a top priority for enhancing quality of life in people with Parkinson disease (PD). The chronic and degenerative nature of PD requires easily accessible and sustainable interventions that effectively delay or reverse walking disability –. Habitual walking at moderate intensities in sufficient quantities can alleviate motor symptoms in PD and promote improvements in gait and balance. However, regular engagement in moderate intensity walking can be challenging for people with PD, who typically experience motor (e.g. loss of walking automaticity, bradykinesia) and non-motor (e.g. depression, lack of motivation) impairments. Commonly impaired gait quality mechanics in PD, such as increased variability in stepping patterns, limit walking stability and further contribute to gait disability in PD. The development of rehabilitation interventions to address this complex array of neurophysiologic impairments, limited real-world walking performance, and reduced engagement in society is needed to counter gait disability.

### Effects of music therapy on mood, pain, and satisfaction in the neurologic inpatient setting [^112yiEjn]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Music therapy (MT) has been used in health care settings for a wide variety of treatment goals. Many inpatients with neurologic impairments struggle with low mood and pain for which MT may be a novel adjunct treatment. The aims of this study were to: (1) evaluate change in mood and pain following a single MT session; (2) explore the impact of an MT program on mood, pain and satisfaction from the perspective of the patient, family and staff.

Materials and Methods

A mixed-methods study was conducted. Forty participants completed pre/post MT surveys evaluating mood, pain and satisfaction. Individual semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted with 14MT program participants (inpatients), 5 family members of participants and 16 staff.

Results

There was significant improvement in mood (p < 0.001) and decrease in pain (p < 0.05) from pre-to-post MT with 74% reporting being "very satisfied" with the session. "Benefits of MT" was the overarching theme of the qualitative data. Subthemes were emotional regulation, pain management, effects on self-concept, enjoyment, and social connectedness.

Conclusions

Improvements in mood and pain were reported from pre-to-post MT session and in interviews. Further evaluation of MT effectiveness against standard of care rehabilitation and cost implications is required. Implications for RehabilitationMusic therapy (MT) is delivered by accredited music therapists (MTAs) in health care settings, including rehabilitation units, as an individual, group or co-treatment therapy.MT can be used for a range of health outcomes, including the treatment of mood and pain, in addition to improving inpatient satisfaction. Early evidence using pre/post MT surveys suggests an improvement in mood and pain following a single therapy session. Qualitative data suggest overall benefit of offering MT services in addition to standard neurorehabilitation therapy, including improvements to emotional regulation, pain management, self-concept, enjoyment, and social connectedness.

### Structural and functional neuroplasticity in music and dance-based rehabilitation: a systematic review [^111a23PM]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Study selection

A total of 2247 studies were initially identified. The first screening, based on titles and abstracts, selected 164 works sought for retrieval.

Subsequently, after assessment for eligibility through a full-text reading, 19 studies were included. Conducting a backward citation search, one additional study was included (see flowchart in Fig. 1).

A total of 20 papers were included in the systematic review. Among these, 2 manuscripts involving patients with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) referred to the same RCT. Similarly, among the 7 papers involving patients with acute stroke, four of them referred to the same RCT. In detail, the study from Sihvonen et al. derived behavioral and neuroimaging findings from pooling results of 2 distinct RCTs (one not registered and one unreported). Subsequently, the other studies by Sihvonen and colleagues focused specifically on a subsample of subjects who completed the neuroimaging session. The rationale behind incorporating all three articles in this systematic review arises from their complementary contributions to the neuroimaging results. Finally, to avoid any duplication of data in our results, when calculating the total number of subjects included, we ensured that patients from the same RCT were counted only once, even if reported in multiple papers.

Risk of bias in studies

Concerning the assessment with the TESTEX score (see Table 1), results showed 4 trials with high-level of quality (score > 11), 13 had a good level of quality (7 ≤ score ≥ 11). Finally, two trials presented a low level of quality (score < 7). One study was not evaluated since only neuroimaging data were reported.

### Music therapy for the treatment of anxiety: a systematic review with multilevel meta-analyses [^1113FLih]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

A considerable number of published clinical trials have examined the anxiety-reducing effects of music therapy interventions across several settings, including mental health care, medical environments, and work- and study-related contexts. Music therapy involves personally tailored music interventions that are designed and implemented by qualified music therapists to meet the specific health needs of individual patients.

Methods

To summarise this evidence base, we conducted a linear restricted maximum likelihood multilevel meta-analysis searching multiple electronic databases (CINAHL, Cochran Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo, Web of Science core collection), from inception to 12th February 2025. The primary measure was the effects of music therapy on 7 psychological anxiety outcomes and physiological outcomes. The secondary measures were outcome, study, sample, or intervention design factors that moderate the effects of music therapy interventions. Meta-analyses were performed on 93 effect sizes (ES) from 51 studies to assess the magnitude of effects of music therapy targeting anxiety outcomes, and to compare effects across key intervention and study design factors. PROSPERO registration (CRD42024495801).

Findings

Of the 10,210 identified records, 6147 records were screened and 51 articles meeting the research criteria were included. Results showed an overall medium effect of music therapy across all anxiety outcomes (g = 0.357, [0.201, 0.514]; 51 trials, 93 ES), of which a medium effect was found in participants' self-reported anxiety (g = 0.410, [0.236, 0.585]; 50 trials, 61 ES) and a small non-significant effect in physiological outcomes (g = 0.153 [-0.153, 0.400]; 13 trials, 32 ES). Subgroup analyses showed significant larger effects for receptive and combination of active and receptive interventions when compared with active interventions.

Interpretation

The findings suggest that music therapy, particularly receptive methods or combinations of receptive and active approaches, offer effective, flexible, and scalable interventions for reducing anxiety symptoms, offering psychological benefits that enhance patient autonomy and quality of life, though its impact on physiological outcomes and long-term effects requires further research.

### Nonpharmacological treatments for patients with Parkinson's disease [^1165xGeh]. Movement Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Since 2013, a number of studies have enhanced the literature and have guided clinicians on viable treatment interventions outside of pharmacotherapy and surgery. Thirty-three randomized controlled trials and one large observational study on exercise and physiotherapy were published in this period. Four randomized controlled trials focused on dance interventions, eight on treatment of cognition and behavior, two on occupational therapy, and two on speech and language therapy (the latter two specifically addressed dysphagia). Three randomized controlled trials focused on multidisciplinary care models, one study on telemedicine, and four studies on alternative interventions, including music therapy and mindfulness. These studies attest to the marked interest in these therapeutic approaches and the increasing evidence base that places nonpharmacological treatments firmly within the integrated repertoire of treatment options in Parkinson's disease.

### Music therapy for the treatment of anxiety: a systematic review with multilevel meta-analyses [^115HWmac]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Studies using a CCT design did not demonstrate significantly higher effects compared to RCTs, even though selection bias in non-randomized studies often inflates treatment effects. While including only RCTs can enhance reliability, their rigorously controlled conditions often limit external validity and generalizability. Reviews that incorporate CCTs may provide a more realistic understanding of effects in everyday music therapy practice, balancing internal validity with practical applicability.

The findings highlight the influence of certain intervention characteristics on the effectiveness of music therapy. Studies utilizing receptive methods (music listening) or a combination of receptive and active methods (music listening combined with singing, playing instruments, improvising) demonstrated significantly larger ES compared to those using active music therapy alone. This suggests that music therapy interventions focusing on listening to music, either exclusively or in combination with active methods, may offer greater therapeutic benefits. Receptive methods, offered or designed by music therapists, demonstrated the strongest effects, making them an ideal choice for integration into resource-constrained environments or in situations where active participation is not feasible. Clinicians might consider prioritizing music therapeutic based listening interventions as a cost-effective and scalable option, which can be deployed in group settings, individual sessions, or even remotely via digital platforms. However, active methods or combinations of receptive and active approaches may offer additional therapeutic benefits beyond what is reflected in effect sizes alone, such as supporting emotional expression, social interaction, and patient engagement.

The smaller and non-significant ES for physiological outcomes suggests that music therapy might not directly influence physiological markers of anxiety or that these effects are less pronounced. However, the robust effects on self-reported anxiety indicate a meaningful psychological impact. This could mean that the primary value of music therapy lies in its ability to improve subjective experiences of anxiety, which can still translate to overall well-being and quality of life. Future research should investigate whether these psychological benefits indirectly influence long-term physiological outcomes.

Our findings suggest that session length, frequency, and total number of sessions do not significantly impact effectiveness, which is crucial for designing flexible intervention models. Clinicians might focus on session quality and content rather than rigidly adhering to specific time frames or frequencies. This flexibility can optimize the potential of music therapy to support individualized care plans tailored to the needs and preferences of clients, making music therapy more adaptable across diverse populations and care settings. This potential for wide applicability is further strengthened by the finding that music therapy had similar effects across the mental health, medical health and work/study settings.

### Music therapy for the treatment of anxiety: a systematic review with multilevel meta-analyses [^112Kuhww]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Second, efficacy on self-reported measures was not corroborated by positive effects on physiological measures. Since this meta-analysis was based on aggregate data, it was not possible to determine whether the weak evidence for efficacy on physiological outcomes was due to confounding (e.g. studies that used less efficacious methods were also more likely to report physiological outcomes), or to a weak correlation between anxiety and physiological change. Other methods, most notably an individual participant data meta-analysis, could shed light on this question, and potentially detect what prognostic factors could predict response to music therapy.

Finally, most included studies lacked masking procedures, meaning that results could have been influenced by expectancy bias ('placebo effect'), as indicated by a significantly larger ES when music therapy was compared to passive control conditions. Masking participants to intervention assignment is difficult and arguably impractical in music therapyas well as nearly any other intervention where participants are asked to perform or participate in an activity. Future research should aim to account for these effects, for example by measuring expectation and/or adopting alternative experimental designs. Improving study quality through the use of larger samples and masking procedures are essential for progressing the field, but can be practically and ethically challenging in anxiety and stress studies. Nonetheless, elements such as ensuring studies are well-powered, masking assessors to the intervention, conducting analyses on an intention-to-treat basis, and increasing transparent reporting and preregistration would be practical measures to improve the quality and reliability of research in this area.

In conclusion, music therapy interventions targeting anxiety demonstrate significant medium effects, establishing them as a viable alternative to other non-pharmacological approaches, such as CBT, and pharmacological treatments. Notably, receptive methods, like music listening, and a combination of receptive and active methods have a greater impact compared to active methods only, such as playing instruments or singing. Consequently, receptive and combined approaches may be considered first-line interventions based on current evidence, though active methods may offer added value depending on individual patient needs and therapeutic goals. The findings also revealed that the duration, frequency, and total number of sessions did not consistently enhance outcomes. This is in line with the flexibility and adaptability in music therapy and the necessity to tailor care plans to the needs and preferences of clients. At the same time, leaving the optimal intervention design unclear. Future research should focus on uncovering the mechanisms underlying music therapy's effectiveness and on identifying the most effective components, therapeutic factors, and combinations for treating anxiety.

### Integrative medicine for pain management in oncology: Society for Integrative Oncology-ASCO guideline [^113DxRjW]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Perioperative or postoperative (surgical) pain — music therapy trial finding and evidence context: A trial reported a statistically significant improvement in the primary end point for the music therapy group compared with the control group (−2.38 [95% CI, −2.80 to −1.95], P < .001) at the first post-test, and this improvement remained significant, although the difference narrowed, at the third post-test; despite preliminary evidence and potential value of integrative interventions, the quality of research evidence is low and insufficient, and adequately powered clinical trials are needed.

### Efficacy of music therapy as a non-pharmacological measure to support Alzheimer's disease patients: a systematic review [^1121iWXs]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

It's worth noting that active music intervention (AMI) can promote socialisation, participation and self-expression to a greater extent than other interventions. MT for MCI patients can also improve their cognition, behaviour, psychology and quality of life to some extent, which helps to reduce the progression of MCI to AD with more severe symptoms. In addition, MT is more effective when combined with other non-pharmacological interventions, and continuous MT has a long-term effect on people with AD and their carers.

Strengths and limitations

This study has some highlights. On one hand, we summarized the effect of MT on the five aspects of AD for the first time, and provided theoretical suggestions for the prevention and management of AD. On the other hand, literatures in this study have a long time span, including different countries, races, genders, ages, and AD patients with different degrees, which can better summarize the intervention effects of MT and combination therapy on AD at home and abroad, and provide a strong basis and theoretical support for the future development of effective and safe non-invasive AD treatment.

Despite the overall high quality of the included studies, there are some limitations. The significant heterogeneity between studies may affect the generalisability of the conclusions, as evidenced by differences in baseline characteristics of participants (e.g. stage of the AD process from early to late stage) and intervention parameters (e.g. duration of receptive MT from 1 h to 2 years). 36% of the trials had a non-randomised controlled design, which may introduce a risk of selection bias. However, only 36% of the studies explicitly implemented assessor blinding, which may lead to measurement bias in subjective scales. In addition, the small sample size (n < 10) of five studies may lead to insufficient statistical power and overestimation of the intervention effect. Twenty-two studies over-relied on screening tools such as the MMSE, lacked in-depth assessment of specific cognitive domains (such as episodic memory, executive function), and the use of objective biomarkers was minimal. In addition, most studies were short-term interventions (study duration ≤ 3 months), which limits the interpretation of long-term effects and dose–response relationships, and limitations in population selection (86% of studies focused on the AD population) make the generalisation of results to patients with mixed dementia uncertain. These methodological and design limitations need to be addressed in future standardised multicentre trials to increase the clinical translation value of the evidence.

### The use of music playlists for people with dementia: a critical synthesis [^1121qQLW]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Selection of studies for inclusion

Purposive sampling was used to select the articles from health and psychology disciplines. All identified references were screened according to the following inclusion criteria: 1) participants had to have some form of dementia or be caring for someone with dementia, 2) the intervention studied must involve the use of pre-recorded music alone or in combination with other musical activities, and 3) the research had to be published between 2006–2016.

Articles not meeting the above inclusion criteria were excluded. Studies relating solely to people with mild cognitive impairment were also excluded, as were opinion or general discussion papers or review papers and studies involving only active forms of musical engagement such as singing, playing musical instruments, or songwriting. While the focus of the current review was not music therapy, where music listening was used in a formal music therapy setting, these were also included because of the potential for such studies to further illuminate the value of music listening for people with dementia.

All types of evaluative studies were eligible for inclusion. While articles were appraised for scientific quality according to conventional standards such as the Joanna Briggs Institute's critical appraisal tools (2016), methodological quality did not form a basis for exclusion since a critique of the reliability of studies in the field was viewed as a central part of the function of the critical analysis and formulation of a synthesizing argument. Abstracts were screened according to these criteria in an initial screening process, leaving a total of 37 articles for review.

Titles and abstracts to be considered were then uploaded to Covidence, an online platform for conducting systematic reviews. Since abstracts did not always provide enough information to assess the studies according to the inclusion criteria, full texts of articles were then subjected to a closer appraisal for relevance by two reviewers, after which a further 9 were excluded, leaving 28 studies for inclusion in the review (Fig. 1).

### Musical motor feedback (MMF) in walking hemiparetic stroke patients: randomized trials of gait improvement [^114gaCpQ]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To demonstrate the effect of rhythmical auditory stimulation in a musical context for gait therapy in hemiparetic stroke patients, when the stimulation is played back measure by measure initiated by the patient's heel-strikes (musical motor feedback). Does this type of musical feedback improve walking more than a less specific gait therapy?

Design

The randomized controlled trial considered 23 registered stroke patients. Two groups were created by randomization: the control group received 15 sessions of conventional gait therapy and the test group received 15 therapy sessions with musical motor feedback.

Setting

Inpatient rehabilitation hospital.

Subjects

Median post-stroke interval was 44 days and the patients were able to walk without technical aids with a speed of approximately 0.71 m/s.

Main Outcome Measures

Gait velocity, step duration, gait symmetry, stride length and foot rollover path length (heel-on-toe-off distance).

Result

The test group showed more mean improvement than the control group: stride length increased by 18% versus 0%, symmetry deviation decreased by 58% versus 20%, walking speed increased by 27% versus 4% and rollover path length increased by 28% versus 11%.

Conclusion

Musical motor feedback improves the stroke patient's walk in selected parameters more than conventional gait therapy. A fixed memory in the patient's mind about the song and its timing may stimulate the improvement of gait even without the presence of an external pacemaker.

### Guidelines for adult stroke rehabilitation and recovery: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^114CRur1]. Stroke (2016). Medium credibility.

Poststroke cognitive rehabilitation — trial details supporting selected nondrug interventions are summarized as follows: An RCT that modified the stroke rehabilitation environment with the provision of a computer with Internet, books, games, virtual reality gaming technology, and encouragement from staff to use the activities increased the engagement of patients with cognitive activities and reduced time spent inactive and alone. Two months of daily listening (95 minutes daily) to self-selected music after acute stroke improved verbal memory, focused attention, and depressive symptoms compared with listening to an audio book or not listening to music. Four weeks of playing virtual reality games for 30-minute sessions 3 times weekly improved visual attention and short-term visuospatial memory in a very small RCT of patients early after stroke.

Nonpharmacologic pain interventions in critically ill adults — evidence gaps include that effects in adults unable to self-report remain unknown; the role of a family member in delivering interventions could be explored; whether music's coanalgesic effect depends on patient musical preferences should be considered; interventions should be evaluated during procedures other than CTR, with implementation studies on feasibility and costs, and studies assessing outcomes such as sleep.

### AAOS / METRC clinical practice guideline summary: pharmacologic, physical, and cognitive pain alleviation for musculoskeletal extremity / pelvis surgery [^115iQtyq]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

Music therapy — post-operative pain and opioid use after musculoskeletal surgery: Music therapy might be used with standard treatment to decrease post-operative pain and opioid use, with Strength of Recommendation: Limited (downgrade). The rationale describes studies after musculoskeletal surgery that noted decreased pain, anxiety, nausea, and mood up to POD 2 with the intervention, and that patients in the intervention arm demonstrated greater readiness to ambulate and less pain and opioid use, as well as higher satisfaction. The Music Therapy recommendation has been downgraded one level because of feasibility issues, and although no potential harms were noted in either study, this needs additional research. Resource and implementation considerations state that current studies used either a board-certified music therapist or CDs at the bedside; in-person therapists and biofeedback machines may present substantial cost and time barriers, and the delivery of this therapy to outpatients remains to be studied. Acceptability notes that use of music for relaxation is accepted but its use for pain control and improved function is less so, and feasibility concerns include that the ability to and cost of hiring a music therapist or training current healthcare professionals could limit use, with MT currently only studied in inpatients.

### Individual music therapy for managing neuropsychiatric symptoms for people with dementia and their carers: a cluster randomised controlled feasibility study [^111izHmq]. BMC Geriatrics (2015). Low credibility.

The term 'music therapy', defined by the World Federation of Music Therapy, is a state registered health discipline in the UK. On completion of the two–year training at master's level, graduates register with the Health and Care Professions Council in order to practice and obtain a legally protected title 'music therapist'. The training involves the tradition of applying psychoanalytical, psychodynamic, developmental, humanistic theories and more recently theories of neuroscience in interactive live music-making as well as verbal and non-verbal communication between the therapist and client in therapy. Typical aims of the sessions for people with dementia can vary due to a person's clinical presentation. However, for psychosocial interventions, the NICE Dementia Pathway outlines the principle aims. These include providing cognitive stimulation for cognitive symptoms and managing non-cognitive symptoms such as agitation and comorbid emotional disorders such as depression and anxiety.

Literature reviews of music therapy in the field of dementia have noted its effects on symptomatic reduction. However, although the term 'music therapy' is used in these reviews, some of the included studies are in fact studies of 'music interventions' which employ group or individualised activities incorporating listening and exercising to recorded music and singing or playing instruments along with recorded music. These activities differentiate from the nature of music therapy as previously described and are delivered by nursing or research staff instead of a qualified music therapist. Music therapy and music interventions may deserve distinctive definitions, particularly as the interactive elements of music therapy are arguably what make this intervention unique.

Regarding active music therapy interventions delivered by a trained music therapist, this has been predominantly investigated in a group setting. Only a small number of these studies are randomised controlled trials; of this subset, there is modest evidence that group music therapy has beneficial effects on symptoms of dementia in the short-term. Reviews have raised questions over the robustness of this evidence, and have emphasised a need for further randomised, controlled trials with better reporting quality

### Music therapy after stroke (subacute phase) [^113SojHP]. ClinicalTrials (2024). Medium credibility.

Therapy After Stroke ClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview The goal of this longitudinal, single-subject study is to investigate the role of motivation in music therapy for stroke patients within the subacute phase, who experience upper limb and/or attention deficits. The main questions it aims to answer are:

- Does music therapy increase patient's motivation to rehabilitate.
- Do increases in motivation correlate with functional improvements, in particular upper limb and/or attention skills. Rationale: Stroke is a highly disabling condition, for which music therapy is regularly used in rehabilitation. Motivation is considered to be a mechanism for functional improvements, including in neurologic music therapy, likely due to potential mood improvements, but it is not generally explicitly investigated. This motivation level may in turn affect not only functional outcomes and subjective well-being, but also adherence to other rehabilitation therapies.

Objectives: The primary goal of the study is to investigate motivation as an underlying mechanism of neurologic music therapy for stroke patients experiencing upper-limb impairments and/or cognitive deficits, in the sub-acute phase of stroke. A secondary goal is to assess NMT-related changes in motor function, cognitive outcomes, and self-reported measures of well-being. The hypothesis is that NMT will increase motivation, and that increased motivational state will positively affect functioning in both motor and/or cognitive domains. All subjects will receive NMT targeting both upper- limb movement and attention.

All participants will receive a target of 9 NMT sessions over 3–6 weeks, aiming for an average of 3 sessions per week, but adjusted to a patient's expected length of stay and ability, using a tailored approach. The study found a significant correlation between patients' intrinsic motivation to engage in musical activities as measured by the BMRQ at baseline and improvement of upper-limb function as measured by the Action Research Arm Test at 3 months, which was not found in the comparator of occupational/physical therapy, with a significant difference between correlations.

### Incorporating music therapy into primary care… [^1131o2Ca]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

To the Editor: Music therapy is a treatment modality that harnesses music as a medical intervention to reach a therapeutic goal. In group or individual sessions, credentialed music therapists work with patients using techniques such as improvisation, lyric analysis, and composition. Music therapy is generally provided in hospitals, rehabilitation centers, and private music therapy practices. Studies conducted primarily in inpatient settings show that music therapists improve the symptoms of children with asthma and reduce hospitalizations 1; address children's mental health needs 2; improve perinatal outcomes in pregnant women with depression, anxiety, and gestational hypertension or preeclampsia 3; and improve pain and quality of life for individuals with chronic pain. 4 For individuals with dementia, music therapy can decrease stress markers and agitation, reduce depression, and improve behavioral problems and short-term recall.

5 Researchers have also observed a significant, long-term decrease in blood pressure after repeated music therapy interventions.
6. Despite evidence supporting music therapy for many common conditions, it is rarely available in outpatient primary care settings. To increase access to this treatment, we need more data on the feasibility and effectiveness of music therapy in outpatient settings. These data may help address barriers to reimbursement. Medicare pays for music therapy services in rehabilitation centers or hospital-based outpatient programs; six states have Medicaid coverage for limited populations. Private insurance plans may cover music therapy on a case-by-case basis, but no plans explicitly include music therapy services.

Outpatient billing may be managed by modeling group music therapy on group mental health programs when treating psychiatric disorders or by following the example of acupuncture, which may be reimbursed if prescribed by a clinician for nonpsychiatric diagnoses. Music therapy is a low-risk intervention that may improve the health of our patients with few to no adverse effects and at a lower cost than many commonly prescribed medications. More research should be done to support the inclusion of music therapy in primary care.

### MUSic therapy in complex specialist neurorehabilitation (MUSICS) [^111xPKTd]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Aim: Investigate whether patients undergoing specialist rehabilitation after complex neurological injury show different functional outcomes if music therapy is included in their rehabilitation program compared to usual care. Background: Patients with complex needs following a brain, spinal cord, and/or peripheral nerve injury often require a period of specialist neurorehabilitation. This involves multiple therapy disciplines, led by a Consultant in Rehabilitation Medicine, Neurology, or Neuropsychiatry. Although music therapy is suggested to enhance neuroplasticity and recovery in patients with brain injury, it is not routinely commissioned in clinical care due to a lack of supportive evidence. Hypothesis: Patients undergoing music therapy in addition to complex specialist rehabilitation show better functional outcomes compared to usual care. Duration for Participants: From consent to discharge from NRU.

Primary Outcome: Change in Functional Independence Measure+Functional Assessment Measure, Northwick Park Dependency Scale, and Barthel Activities of Daily Living pre and post 15 hours intervention. Secondary Outcome: Change in quality of life, psychological distress, social interaction, well-being, and communication, pre and post 15 hours intervention. Mean difference in well-being throughout the intervention period between music therapy and control therapy groups. Mean difference in post-intervention pain and mood visual analogue scores between music therapy and control therapy groups.

During sessions, the Music Therapist will work flexibly as a musician, drawing on a range of musical resources and techniques to encourage patients' active engagement in music making in ways that are considered likely to support their emotional, social, cognitive and physical rehabilitation. Sessions will be tailored to the individual and largely improvisatory, with the Music Therapist responding in the moment to the participant and vice versa, although the therapist's decision-making will also be informed by broader context about the patient and their engagement in previous sessions. A music therapy session may also involve the following activities, although they will usually be approached in an improvisatory rather than pre-structured way: songwriting, singing familiar songs, listening to, sharing and discussing music, developing specific musical skills of interest to the participant, structured musical games and activities, joint working with other members of the therapy team in sessions focussed on functional development and communication skills.
