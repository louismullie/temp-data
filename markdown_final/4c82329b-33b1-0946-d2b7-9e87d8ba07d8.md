## Question

Crohn's fistula abscess TPN

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when and how to use total parenteral nutrition (TPN) in Crohn's disease with fistula and/or abscess, including indications, timing, alternatives, and outcomes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and definitions of fistulizing disease and abscess. Then, I should verify the overarching principle that enteral nutrition is preferred when feasible. Next, I will identify the specific scenarios where TPN is indicated, including high-output fistula, preoperative optimization with abscess/phlegmon, and malnutrition with enteral failure. After that, I should review the evidence base and quantify benefits where possible. Finally, I will outline practical implementation, duration, monitoring, and when to transition off TPN, and I will double-check for any conflicting guidance that might change practice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and definitions so I don't jump to conclusions. Fistulizing Crohn's disease includes enterocutaneous, enteroenteric, enterovesical, and rectovaginal fistulas, often arising from transmural inflammation and frequently coexisting with abscesses or phlegmonous change; abscesses are localized collections of infection that can be spontaneous or associated with fistulous tracts and often require source control before definitive therapy [^114JoZvL] [^112zqB9R].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about TPN being the default. I need to check the foundational principle: enteral nutrition is preferred whenever the gut is accessible and safe, because it preserves mucosal integrity, reduces infectious complications, and supports immunologic function; TPN is reserved for situations where enteral nutrition is not feasible or insufficient to meet needs for 7–10 days or more [^1145HcDz] [^115De9ng].

> Now, I will examine the first major indication where TPN is appropriate: high-output gastrointestinal fistula. Let me verify the threshold and rationale. Multiple high-credibility guidelines converge on initiating partial or exclusive TPN for proximal fistulas and/or very high output, typically > 500 mL/day, because high losses of fluid, electrolytes, protein, and calories cannot be met enterally and risk malnutrition, electrolyte derangements, and delayed healing; ASPEN also supports TPN when EN cannot deliver > 60% of energy/protein goals for 7–10 days [^115De9ng] [^111SEWfc] [^114QG4Pm] [^1145HcDz].

> Next, I should review the second major indication: preoperative optimization in the setting of intra-abdominal abscess and/or phlegmonous inflammation that limits enteral intake. The AGA recommends short-term preoperative TPN to provide bowel rest, reduce infection and inflammation, and optimize surgical outcomes as a bridge to definitive management; WSES-AAST similarly supports TPN in complicated IBD requiring emergency surgery, and ESPEN advises preoperative nutrition support for 7–10 days in malnourished patients, extending longer if severely malnourished, even if it delays surgery [^116bzrp6] [^111Fk6tx] [^112qLubW] [^112DBEgF] [^111nPRpb].

> I will now examine the third indication: severe malnutrition with enteral failure. I should confirm that this applies when oral/enteral nutrition has been trialed and failed or when enteral access is not feasible or contraindicated. AGA and ASPEN endorse TPN in this scenario to correct deficits and stabilize the patient, recognizing that malnutrition is common in Crohn's and independently increases postoperative morbidity [^111cXsMM] [^111AQKhJ] [^116KMUpC].

> Let me consider the evidence base so I don't overstate benefits. Preoperative exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) consistently reduces postoperative infectious complications in Crohn's, with pooled relative risk reductions around 50% for intra-abdominal sepsis and skin/soft tissue infections; TPN shows less consistent benefit, though some cohort data suggest fewer complications with preoperative TPN compared with no nutrition, and meta-analytic data indicate lower overall complications with preoperative nutrition support versus standard care, with EEN outperforming TPN in many analyses [^115vZRzQ] [^1141NssN] [^113YJ4Wv].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit for TPN specifically. A meta-analysis of preoperative nutrition in Crohn's showed postoperative complications 20.0% with nutrition support versus 61.3% without, with EEN driving much of the effect; TPN showed a smaller, non-significant reduction in complications, reinforcing that TPN is second-line when EN is not feasible rather than equivalent therapy [^1141NssN].

> I should double-check the practical implementation details. For high-output fistula, TPN is typically continued until output falls below 500 mL/day or until definitive surgical management; for preoperative optimization, 7–14 days is reasonable, extending toward 2–3 weeks if malnutrition is severe; for malnutrition with enteral failure, continue TPN until nutritional markers and clinical status improve and a safe enteral route is established, with transition planning to avoid prolonged TPN risks [^1145HcDz] [^111nPRpb] [^116yuXTL].

> Next, I should review monitoring and safety. I need to ensure daily assessment of electrolytes, renal and hepatic function, glucose, and trace elements during TPN; track fistula output, weight, and serum proteins as prognostic markers, recognizing that albumin reflects inflammation and sepsis control as much as nutrition per se; and coordinate multidisciplinary care to manage sepsis, drain abscesses when indicated, and plan definitive therapy [^114254zx] [^1123KRzh] [^111nPRpb].

> But wait, what if a distal, low-output fistula is present — could enteral nutrition still work? I should confirm that distal, low-output fistulas may indeed be managed with enteral nutrition, often as food or polymeric formulas, reserving TPN for those with high output, proximal location, or failure of EN; this aligns with ESPEN guidance and supports a stepwise approach rather than defaulting to TPN [^1138pp6F] [^116aD3s5].

> I will now examine alternatives and adjuncts so I don't overuse TPN. Fistuloclysis can replace TPN in selected enterocutaneous fistulas with mucocutaneous continuity, maintaining nutrition enterally while controlling output; somatostatin analogs may reduce output but evidence for improved closure is limited, so they should be used selectively rather than routinely [^117YGQ17] [^112azpcK].

> Let me reconsider the hierarchy of nutrition therapy to ensure internal consistency. Enteral nutrition is first-line when feasible; TPN is indicated for high-output fistula, preoperative optimization with abscess/phlegmon limiting EN, and severe malnutrition with enteral failure; short-term TPN is appropriate to bridge to surgery or to stabilize, with prompt transition back to EN or oral intake as soon as safe to mitigate TPN-related complications [^1145HcDz] [^1153DUnc] [^116yuXTL].

> Finally, I should confirm that my synthesis aligns with contemporary guidelines and that I haven't missed any conflicting statements. Across AGA, ESPEN, WSES-AAST, and surgical society guidance, the indications and sequencing I've outlined are consistent, with the caveat that EEN has stronger evidence for preoperative benefit than TPN, which supports choosing EN whenever the clinical scenario allows [^116bzrp6] [^1153DUnc] [^112DBEgF] [^116KMUpC].

---

TPN is indicated in Crohn's disease with fistula/abscess when **enteral nutrition is not feasible** due to high-output fistula, obstruction, or severe malabsorption, and as a bridge to surgery or medical therapy after source control [^1153DUnc] [^116bzrp6]. TPN does not replace source control; **abscesses must be drained** and sepsis treated before TPN is used to restore nutrition and support healing [^112zqB9R] [^111MjQ9S]. TPN is not first-line and should be reserved for patients who cannot meet needs enterally, with close monitoring for complications [^1145HcDz] [^116kB9MD].

---

## Indications for TPN in Crohn's disease with fistula and abscess

TPN is indicated in Crohn's disease with fistula and abscess when **enteral nutrition is not feasible** or insufficient to meet nutritional needs [^1145HcDz]. Specific indications include:

- **High-output fistulas**: Output > 500 mL/day, particularly proximal fistulas, where enteral nutrition exacerbates losses and impairs absorption [^1153DUnc] [^111SEWfc].

- **Intestinal obstruction**: Mechanical blockage or strictures preventing enteral access or causing repeated vomiting [^115De9ng] [^115xpQHK].

- **Severe malabsorption**: Extensive disease or short bowel syndrome limiting enteral nutrient absorption [^115De9ng] [^111AQKhJ].

- **Preoperative optimization**: Short-term TPN to improve nutritional status and reduce complications before elective surgery in malnourished patients with abscess or phlegmon [^116bzrp6] [^111Fk6tx].

- **Failure of enteral nutrition**: Inability to achieve > 60% of energy/protein goals orally or enterally for 7–10 days [^1145HcDz].

---

## Clinical benefits of TPN in Crohn's disease with fistula and abscess

TPN provides **several clinical benefits** in this setting:

- **Nutritional repletion**: Corrects malnutrition, restores body composition, and improves immune function [^notfound].

- **Bowel rest**: Reduces intestinal traffic, decreasing fistula output and promoting healing [^116bzrp6].

- **Preoperative optimization**: Lowers postoperative complications, including infections and anastomotic leaks, in malnourished patients [^115vZRzQ] [^113YJ4Wv].

- **Bridge to therapy**: Stabilizes patients until sepsis is controlled and definitive medical or surgical therapy can be initiated [^111NwjWc].

---

## Limitations and risks of TPN

Despite its benefits, TPN carries **significant risks and limitations**:

- **Catheter-related infections**: Central venous access increases the risk of sepsis and thrombosis [^notfound].

- **Metabolic complications**: Refeeding syndrome, electrolyte disturbances, and liver dysfunction can occur [^notfound].

- **Cost and resource intensity**: TPN requires specialized equipment, training, and monitoring [^notfound].

- **No disease-modifying effect**: TPN does not treat the underlying inflammation or fistula tract [^1136mBUp].

---

## Comparison with enteral nutrition

Enteral nutrition (EN) is **preferred over TPN** whenever feasible because it:

- **Preserves gut integrity**: Maintains mucosal barrier and immune function [^1145HcDz].

- **Lower complication rates**: Fewer infections and metabolic complications than TPN [^notfound].

- **Cost-effective**: Less expensive and more accessible than TPN [^notfound].

However, EN may be contraindicated in high-output fistulas, obstruction, or severe malabsorption, where TPN becomes necessary [^1153DUnc] [^115De9ng].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines emphasize **individualized decision-making**:

- **ESPEN 2023**: Initiate partial or exclusive TPN in Crohn's with proximal/high-output fistula or when enteral nutrition is not feasible [^1153DUnc] [^111SEWfc].

- **AGA 2024**: Consider short-term TPN for high-output fistula, prolonged ileus, short bowel, or severe malnutrition when EN fails or is contraindicated [^111cXsCX] [^114D5XER].

- **WSES-AAST 2021**: Reserve TPN for nutritionally deficient patients unable to tolerate EN, especially with high-output fistula or when emergency surgery is needed [^114sqDPy] [^112DBEgF].

---

## Practical clinical approach

A practical approach is to **follow this sequence**:

| **Step** | **Action** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Stabilize the patient: control sepsis, drain abscesses, and correct fluid/electrolyte imbalances [^112zqB9R] [^111MjQ9S] |
| 2 | Assess nutritional status and gastrointestinal function [^113Q3Ym3] |
| 3 | Attempt enteral nutrition if feasible; if not, initiate TPN [^1145HcDz] |
| 4 | Monitor closely for complications and adjust therapy as needed [^114254zx] |
| 5 | Transition to enteral nutrition as soon as clinically safe [^116yuXTL] |

---

TPN is a **valuable adjunct** in Crohn's disease with fistula and abscess when enteral nutrition is not feasible, providing nutritional repletion and supporting healing. It should be used selectively, with careful monitoring, and transitioned to enteral nutrition as soon as possible to minimize complications.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with severe infections, abscess, or sepsis are ineligible for standard treatment using biological and immunosuppressive drug regimens. We report a case of complicated Crohn's disease with ruptured abdominal abscess, presence of enterocutaneous fistula, and sepsis. We also report and discuss patient management with parenteral nutrition (PN) and enteral nutrition (EN) and treatment outcomes. We report a case of a 31-year-old female with a 10-year history of IBD in clinical remission, who, after previous total proctocolectomy with J-pouch, presented to the clinic with severe abdominal pain of 2 days, unintentional weight loss, fatigue, fever, and abdominal abscess, which ruptured, and her clinical state became complicated by sepsis. PN was initiated using individually prepared admixture according to patient requirements, because of inability to tolerate any oral intake. Following the remittance of ileus symptoms, EN was added using a semielemental formula via a nasojejunal tube. Upon completion of the treatment, the fistula resolved, the wound had healed, and Crohn's Disease Activity Index score showed remission. This qualified the patient for initiation of biological therapy with infliximab. Patients with severe infections, abscesses, or sepsis are ineligible for standard IBD treatment using biological and immunosuppressive drug regimens. Furthermore, usually patients' nutrition condition prevents them from combating infection and initiating proper healing process. This case demonstrates the importance of considering nutrition therapy-PN and EN-in unstable patients who cannot be treated with standard pharmacological therapy. Nutrition therapy offers a bridge that allows patients to stabilize and heal before starting standard pharmacological treatment with immunosuppressive agents or biological therapy.

Statement 4.12

Total parenteral nutrition should be reserved for nutritionally deficient IBD patients unable to tolerate enteral nutrition and when the enteral route is contraindicated, in critically ill patients presenting with signs of shock, intestinal ischemia, high output fistula, and/or severe intestinal hemorrhage (QoE B).

Statement 4.13

Total parenteral nutrition is the mode of choice when emergency surgery is needed for complicated IBD (QoE A).

Recommendations

We recommend evaluating medical treatment in IBD patients presenting with acute abdominal pain and disease activity in a multidisciplinary approach (strong recommendation based on low-level evidence 1C).

We recommend not routinely administrating antibiotics in IBD patients but only in the presence of superinfection, intra-abdominal abscesses, and sepsis (strong recommendation based on high-level evidence 1A)

We recommend administering antibiotics according to the epidemiology and resistance of the setting in a duration that depends on the patient's clinical and biochemical findings. Antifungals should be reserved for high-risk patients such as those with bowel perforation and recent steroid treatment (strong recommendation based on high-level evidence 1A).

We recommend administering as soon as possible venous thromboembolism prophylaxis with LMWH for the high risk of thrombotic events related to complicated IBD and the emergency setting (strong recommendation based on high-level evidence 1A).

We recommend weaning off steroids (wean preoperatively, ideally 4 weeks) and stopping immunomodulators associated with anti-TNF-α agents before surgery, as soon as possible to decrease the risk of postoperative complications, in accordance with a gastroenterologist (strong recommendation based on moderate level evidence 1B).

We recommend administering nutritional support (parenteral or enteral, according to GI function and in conjunction with a dietician/nutrition team) in IBD patients as soon as possible (strong recommendation based on moderate level evidence 1B).

Preoperative nutritional support — patients with malnutrition may decrease postoperative morbidity (Weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C). Malnutrition may be defined as greater than 10% weight loss in the previous 3 months or BMI < 18.5 kg/m², and it is found in up to 85% of patients with Crohn's disease. A systematic review of 29 studies found malnutrition to be associated with increased postoperative morbidity and preoperative nutritional support to be associated with improved outcomes; retrospective series show that 4 weeks to 3 months of preoperative exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) significantly decreased postoperative complications and related septic outcomes, and in a large study of 498 patients, preoperative EEN was associated with decreased intestinal diversion, anastomotic leak, and reoperation. Total parenteral nutrition can be used when patients are unable to tolerate oral intake.

### Combined biologics and exclusive enteral nutrition promote early transmural healing and improve long-term outcomes in Crohn's disease: a multicenter retrospective study [^114tPY3i]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Crohn's disease (CD), a chronic, relapsing–remitting inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), is characterized by transmural inflammation that may affect any segment of the gastrointestinal tract. This pathological hallmark predisposes patients to progressive bowel damage, including strictures, fistulas, and abscesses, often culminating in surgical intervention. Despite advancements in biologic therapies — such as anti‐tumor necrosis factor (anti‐TNF) agents, integrin inhibitors, and interleukin antagonists — achieving sustained remission remains elusive for a substantial proportion of patients. Primary non‐response and secondary loss of response to biologics occur in 30–60% of cases, with higher rates observed in patients with ileal‐predominant disease or penetrating phenotypes. These therapeutic challenges underscore the urgent need for adjunctive strategies to enhance biologic efficacy, mitigate disease progression, and redefine treatment goals beyond symptomatic control.

4.8.2 Medical therapy

In the first instance, patient optimisation is required when localised perforation in Crohn's disease has led to abscess formation. Surgical intervention is mandatory within the context of free peritonitis and highly likely to be required at some stage in the setting of localised abscess formation. Ideally, surgery takes place following treatment of sepsis and treatment of nutritional deficiencies. Exclusive enteral nutrition can be an effective means of controlling intestinal inflammation without use of corticosteroids.

Good Practice Recommendation 10. Following treatment of an abdominal abscess in the setting of non-perianal fistulising Crohn's disease, joint medical and surgical discussion is required, but interval surgical resection is not always necessary (Agreement: 100%).

Some observers suggest that surgery may be avoided by percutaneous radiological drainage of abscesses and then resumption of medical therapy. The largest case series to date of 51 patients identified retrospectively from review of medical charts from a single centre over a 10-year period has shown that patients undergoing surgical resection were significantly less likely to develop abscess recurrence than those treated with antibiotics alone or percutaneous drainage over a mean follow-up of 3.75 years (12% vs 56%). Nevertheless, non-surgical approaches were successful in preventing subsequent surgery in almost half of the patients treated medically. An almost identical proportion of patients avoided surgery over long-term follow-up in a different series of 32 patients managed with percutaneous drainage for perforating Crohn's disease. This strategy, if successful in treating sepsis, is likely to lead to lower morbidity and potentially lower stoma rates.

When We Should Not Use CDED

Figure 2 and Supplementary Table 1 serve as guides to when CDED might not be appropriate. Following index studies in pediatric IBD with strictly defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, there is inevitably a period of "mission creep" where patients showing inadequate response to other therapies (and/or facing surgery) are given the newer treatment, such as CDED. In contrast, historical and more recent data have shown that the judicious use of EEN can provide real benefit in terms of improving perioperative outcomes and avoiding surgery in some patients. In the index CDED-RCT, notable exclusion criteria were mainly left-side colonic involvement, active extraintestinal (eg, joint or liver) disease, active perianal disease, and prior surgery of complicated CD (stenosing/penetrating). Patients who lost response to biologics were reported to benefit from CDED + PEN, but notable exclusion criteria were fever > 38.5°C, current bowel obstruction, intra-abdominal abscess, intercurrent or opportunistic infection. With increasing experience with CDED + PEN, we should continue to exercise great caution when using food-based enteral nutritional therapy in the presence of stenotic findings on imaging, and even more so if endoscopy has shown a stenotic segment or symptoms of stenosis are present. In the presence of mild stenosis on imaging, a period EEN may be attempted. Endoscopic stenosis or symptoms of stenosis at the time of considering EEN should trigger follow-up imaging to document resolution of prestenotic dilatation and resolution of clinical symptoms of stenosis before considering broadening the oral diet towards CDED + PEN phase 1. A fixed stricture should prompt timely consideration of surgery and preoperative nutritional optimization with EEN or, when this is not tolerated, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) in keeping with ESPGHAN guidelines.

Figure 2.
Optimizing CDED: suggested indications, contraindications, and essential considerations.

Before prescribing CDED, several patient-related factors must first be considered. These include patient's history of maladaptive eating behaviors and eating disorders, including ARFID, access to recommended foods, ability to maintain the cost of the diet, religious and personal practices, and impact of diet on quality of life. Other important aspects to consider are current psychopathology and overall motivation to adhere to the diet, as discussed in further detail later on.

### When is parenteral nutrition appropriate? [^113knPsr]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Home parenteral nutrition (HPN) duration considerations include that "Irreversible gastrointestinal dysfunction can lead to long-term — even lifelong — dependence on HPN, but briefer courses of HPN are often appropriate". Surgical complications may merit shorter courses, as "Patients with complex surgical problems, such as an enterocutaneous fistula, may benefit from a more limited course of HPN", and "For instance, on average, spontaneous closure of an enterocutaneous fistula takes place in 25 days for patients receiving PN". In palliative care, "a 2- to 3-month expected survival is commonly used to identify candidates who are likely to benefit from HPN".

Regarding specific circumstances for Crohn's disease, more specifically with respect to patients with enterocutaneous fistula (nutritional assessment), ASPEN/FELANPE 2017 guidelines recommend to diagnose malnutrition based on nutrition history, including unintentional weight loss and estimation of energy/nutrient intake, and physical examination.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of timing and outcome of intestinal failure surgery in patients with enteric fistula [^116Gaems]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Out of 1549 articles initially identified by the search, 70 were selected for a full text review (Fig. 1). Fifty-five articles were excluded for the following reasons: forty-two articles did not describe the criteria for elective surgery nor did they report separately on the results of acute and elective surgery. Six studies included less than 25 elective patients. Four studies reported on two identical or overlapping cohorts and were, therefore, combined for the purpose of our analysis. One study described staged management, and three other studies did not report on this review's primary outcome. One study was a conference abstract. Finally, fifteen studies (10 retrospective cohort studies and five prospective cohort studies) were included, comprising a total of 1380 patients who had undergone elective ECF/EAF surgery. Included studies were published between 2004 and 2016. Table 1 presents the characteristics and outcomes of the included studies.

Although medical management can control symptoms in a recurring incurable disease, such as Crohn's disease, surgical management is reserved for disease complications or those problems refractory to medical management. In this article, we cover general principles for the surgical management of Crohn's disease, ranging from skin tags, abscesses, fistulae, and stenoses to small bowel and extraintestinal disease.

### Patient optimization for surgery relating to Crohn's disease [^1155cTLQ]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Medium credibility.

The majority of patients with Crohn's disease require abdominal surgery during their lifetime, some of whom will require multiple operations. Postoperative complications are seen more frequently in patients requiring abdominal surgery for Crohn's disease than in patients requiring abdominal surgery for other conditions. In this article, we review the evidence supporting preoperative optimization, discussing strategies that potentially improve surgical outcomes and reduce perioperative morbidity and mortality. We discuss the roles of adequate cross-sectional imaging, nutritional optimization, appropriate adjustments of medical therapy, management of preoperative abscesses and phlegmons, smoking cessation and thromboembolic prophylaxis. We also review operation-related factors, and discuss their potential implications with respect to postoperative complications. Overall, the literature suggests that preoperative management has a major effect on postoperative outcomes.

4.8.5 Enterocutaneous fistulae

Statement 59. We suggest that low volume enterocutaneous fistulae may be controlled with immunomodulator and biological therapy. High-volume fistulae usually require surgery to achieve symptom control (GRADE: weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence. Agreement: 100%).

Enterocutaneous fistulae usually communicate with segments of active Crohn's inflammation, often in the context of other complications including intra-abdominal abscess and luminal strictures, or with surgical anastomoses (as a manifestation of the poor healing which characterises Crohn's disease). Historically, enterocutaneous fistulae were treated surgically but, with the advent of anti-TNF therapy, conservative approaches can be deployed and may lead to definitive fistula closure in some patients. There are no prospective trial data to guide therapy. Both the fistulae and any associated complications will need to be managed together. For example, in the context of a high output fistula with nutritional deficiency and luminal stricture, a patient will require a period of nutritional and biochemical optimisation, control of sepsis and drainage of collections before definitive surgical management.

There is little formal evidence on the role of immunosuppressive therapy. If a fistula is associated with active inflammation then medical therapy is worthwhile, but it is unlikely to help a postoperative fistula. A retrospective series of 48 patients with enterocutaneous fistula from GETAID included 21 postoperative fistulae (within 30 days of surgery, most but not all of which were intestinal resections). One third had multiple tracts and one quarter had high output. In addition to managing the associated complications, patients were treated with anti-TNF therapy. One third had fistula healing, half of whom relapsed over a median follow-up of 3 years. One third of patients developed an intra-abdominal abscess while on anti-TNF therapy. Surgery was required in 54% of patients overall. Complexity (multiple tracts) and associated stenosis were associated with reduced rates of healing with anti-TNF therapy and increased need for surgery. Increasing complexity of the fistula is associated with adverse outcomes including mortality. All patients with enterocutaneous fistulae should be managed by a multidisciplinary team.

### WSES-AAST guidelines: management of inflammatory bowel disease in the emergency setting [^117Va5vM]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Independent risk factors for PD failure are bowel wall thickness, disease length, bowel dilation, and abscess size of greater than 6 cm. Furthermore, multiple percutaneous drainage procedures have been required in 8–20% of patients and it could increase the risk of complications such as damage to vital structures in close proximity to the abscess or severe hemorrhage.

Complications of PD, for both spontaneous and post-surgical abscesses (not specific to CD), occur in approximately 10% of procedures. Major complications such as sepsis, small bowel fistulae, colon perforation, and death (due to sepsis or hemorrhage) have been described in 5–11% of cases. Minor complications (such as bacteremia or infection at the site of the catheter insertion) occur in approximately 3%.

Feagins et al. suggested that non-drainable abscesses smaller than 3 cm and without evidence of fistula and no steroid therapy are likely to respond to antibiotic therapy alone although with high recurrence rates. In this setting, antibiotics should cover Gram-negative bacteria and anaerobes and it is important to closely observe the clinical condition of the patient in case of any deterioration.

Antibiotic therapy, including a combination of fluoroquinolones or third-generation cephalosporin and metronidazole in patients with CD, should be adapted to the sensitivity of the bacteria (and sometimes fungi) to antibiotics, if PD is performed.

The appropriate duration of antibiotic therapy is unclear. Clinical improvement should be seen within 3–5 days after starting antibiotics and percutaneous drainage, with a decrease in drainage production. If a patient's condition does not improve, re-evaluation and repeat imaging are indicated to determine whether the abscess has been adequately drained. If not, repositioning of the drain or surgical intervention is required.

If sepsis is controlled after adequate PD, CD medication should be started to prevent recurrence. Patients with a concomitant stenosis, an entero-cutaneous fistula or refractory active disease are likely to require surgery, but preoperative PD, if it is feasible, associated with delayed surgery, can decrease the extent of intestinal resection, postoperative septic complications, and potentially reduce stoma rates.

Q.4: In patients presenting with complications related to IBD, what is the appropriate medical treatment and nutritional support?

### Recurrent pneumonia and colobronchial fistula from Crohn's disease: infliximab alters and simplifies surgical management [^115rcis9]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Figure 1

Colobronchial fistula tract (arrows) coursing from hepatic flexure and extending on the liver anteriorly and eventually communicating to right lower lobe bronchus with surrounding lung consolidation. Figures A and B demonstrate gastrointestinal contrast in the lung parenchyma. Figures C and D show fistula tract containing contrast from colon over the right lobe of the liver

Initially, the pneumonia was treated with empiric antibiotics, and Crohn's disease was treated with IV ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, bowel rest and total parenteral nutrition. Gastroenterology had previously recommended delaying infliximab until pneumonia was well controlled. He refused upper endoscopy and upper GI series was done showing normal gastric mucosa and confirming the normal duodenal findings of the CT enteroclysis. After antibiotics were started, we started immunosuppressive therapy with azathiprine and budesonide. He did not tolerate azathioprine. Infliximab (3 mg/kg) with acetaminophen premedication was initiated after five days of antibiotics. After discharge, outpatient maintenance therapy and remission of Crohn's disease was attained with four-weekly infliximab infusions (3 mg/kg) for a total of five doses, prednisone (did not tolerate budesonide), and suppressive amoxicillin/clavulanate. Significant improvement was evident after a twenty pound weight gain, mild intermittent non-productive cough, no recurrence of fevers and malaise, and normalization of chest radiograph (Fig. 3). Antibiotics, and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) were stopped and steroids were weaned off.

Figure 3
Chest radiograph after recovery

Exploratory laparotomy revealed multiple colocolonic fistulas and a colonic fistula at the hepatic flexure that led into a sinus tract going up over the liver and to the diaphragm. The small bowel was normal as was the rectum and colon on flexible sigmoidoscopy to 40 cm. Total abdominal colectomy was performed with subsequent debridement of granulation tissue within the fistula tract. Surgery concluded with a side- to-side ileoproctostomy. No major complications developed in the post-operative period. Pathology of the resected colon revealed no active Crohn's disease at either the proximal small bowel margin or the distal rectal margin. He remains non-compliant with follow-up and has failed to keep his gastroenterology appointments.

### Does preoperative enteral nutrition reduce the incidence of surgical complications in patients with Crohn's disease? A case-matched study [^116v7he9]. Colorectal Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Aim

Currently, the notion that preoperative optimization with enteral nutrition (EN) reduces the incidence of complication after surgery in Crohn's disease (CD) patients is being debated. This case-matched study was to evaluate the impact of preoperative EN on surgical outcomes in patients with CD.

Method

Twenty-four patients received EN therapy with an elemental diet (1800–2400 kcal/day) for at least 2 weeks before the planned surgery (EN group). A further 24 patients who underwent surgery without receiving preoperative EN or parenteral nutrition formed a control group based on four matched criteria: age (≤ / > 40 years), the use of preoperative medications (corticosteroids/azathioprine/biologics), disease behaviour (inflammatory/stricturing/penetrating) and main surgical procedure (ileal resection/ileocolonic resection/colectomy). The incidence of complications observed within 30 days after surgery was compared between the two groups. Septic complications were defined as anastomotic leak, intra-abdominal abscess, entero-cutaneous fistula or wound infection.

Results

In the EN group, the median serum albumin level significantly increased, while C-reactive protein (CRP) significantly decreased during the preoperative EN (albumin, from 3.0 mg/dl to 3.1 mg/dl, P = 0.04; CRP, from 3.05 mg/dl to 2.52 mg/dl, P = 0.02). The incidence of postoperative septic complications was significantly lower in the EN group compared with the control group (4% vs 25%, P = 0.04). The occurrence rate of overall complications was lower in the EN group (21% vs 29%, P = 0.51), but not statistically significant.

Conclusion

In patients with CD, preoperative optimization with EN reduced the overall rate of postoperative complications and significantly decreased postoperative septic complications.

### WSES-AAST guidelines: management of inflammatory bowel disease in the emergency setting [^1141NssN]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Parenteral nutrition should be reserved for nutritionally deficient IBD patients unable to tolerate enteral nutrition and when the enteral route is contraindicated in patients presenting with severe shock, intestinal ischemia, high output fistula, and/or severe intestinal hemorrhage.

Preoperative nutrition supplementation reduces postoperative complications in patients with CD, in particular, enteral nutrition. In a recent meta-analysis (3 prospective and 2 retrospective studies including 1111 CD patients), it was reported that the rate of postoperative complications in the group receiving preoperative nutritional (enteral or total parenteral nutrition) support was 20.0% compared with 61.3% in the group who had standard care without nutritional support [OR = 0.26, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.07–0.99, P < 0.001]. Postoperative complications occurred in 15.0% of patients in the group who received preoperative total parenteral nutrition compared with 24.4% in the group who did not (OR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.23–1.88, P = 0.43). Postoperative complications occurred in 21.9% in the group who received preoperative enteral nutrition compared with 73.2% in the group that did not received preoperative enteral nutrition (OR = 0.09, 95% CI: 0.06–0.13, P < 0.001).

### Clinical outcome and factors predictive of recurrence after enterocutaneous fistula surgery [^112DRJym]. Annals of Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Recent experience with surgery for enterocutaneous fistulae (ECF) at a specialist colorectal unit is reviewed to define factors relating to a successful surgical outcome.

Summary Background Data

ECF cause significant morbidity and mortality and need experienced surgical management. Previous publications have concentrated on mortality resulting from fistulae, while factors affecting recurrence have not previously been a focus of analysis.

Methods

Records were reviewed of patients who had ECF surgery (1994–2001). Management strategy involved early drainage of sepsis and nutritional support prior to elective ECF repair, with selective defunctioning proximal stoma formation.

Results

A total of 205 patients were available (89 males, 43%; median age, 51 years; range, 16–86) years). ECF were related to Crohn's disease in 95, ulcerative colitis in 18, diverticular disease in 17, carcinoma in 25 (16 after radiotherapy), mesh ventral hernia repair in 21, and other causes in 29. Forty-one (20%) had undergone attempted fistula repair at other institutions. Initial management included CT-guided drainage of an intra-abdominal abscess in 23 patients, and total parenteral nutrition in 74 (36%). A total of 203 patients had definitive ECF repair. Forty-four had oversewing or wedge resection of the fistula, and 159 had resection and reanastomosis of the involved small bowel segment or ileocolic anastomosis. Ninety-day operative mortality was 3.5%. A total of 42 (20.5%) patients developed ECF recurrence within 3 months. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that recurrence was more likely after oversewing (36%) than resection (16%, P = 0.006).

Conclusions

A strategy of drainage of acute sepsis, maintenance of nutritional support prior to surgery, and selective use of PS allows for primary closure in 80% of complicated ECF. Resection should be performed when feasible.

### Review of exclusive enteral therapy in adult Crohn's disease [^111DycfH]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

EEN for fistulising and structuring disease may avoid surgery. In a retrospective cohort study of 51 adult patients treated with EEN prior to surgery, 25% avoided surgery altogether. A lack of prior EEN optimisation was associated with a ninefold increase in postoperative complications such as abscess formation and anastomotic leaks (p = 0.04). Despite this promising result, the relatively small study cohort was from a single centre. A cohort study found that EN in adult patients with CD with an intra-abdominal abscess had a reduced need for surgery (26.1% vs 56.3%, p = 0.01). Multivariate analysis found EN to be an independent protective factor for requiring surgery. A recent Australian observational study found that among patients with fistulising and/or structuring CD receiving EEN, a greater proportion in the group that completed at least 6 weeks of EEN avoided surgery (100%) compared with those that did not complete the minimum of 6 weeks therapy (43%, p = 0.02). Larger controlled trials with long-term data, however, are needed to confirm these findings.

Malnutrition presurgery increases risk of complications, and EEN can benefit this subset of patients. A small non-randomised prospective trial administering preoperative EEN to 10 malnourished adult patients with CD (defined as at least one of: BMI < 18.5 kg/m², serum albumin < 3 g/dL or weight loss > 10%). This significantly improved clinical disease activity, CRP and albumin, and avoided surgery in two patients. Despite the intervention population being malnourished, postoperative complications and 6-month recurrence rates were similar to five nutritionally replete patients who went to immediate surgery. Similarly, a prospective trial compared outcomes between high-risk patients who underwent EEN presurgery with a polymeric diet enriched with transforming growth factor-beta 2, to low-risk patients who proceeded to direct surgery. High-risk patients were those with any one of the following: presence of obstructive symptoms, steroid treatment, preoperative weight loss > 10% and perforating CD. Postoperative complication rates were similar between the high-risk and low-risk patients (8/35 (23.8%) vs 5/21 (22.9%), p = 1). EEN presurgery may be of greatest benefit among malnourished or high-risk patients, improving outcomes to a similar level as nourished or lower-risk patients.

### Crohn's disease basics | IBD… [^115pRYVm]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

How Crohn's disease impacts the digestive tract Inflammation from Crohn's disease causes the walls of the intestines to thicken. This makes affected areas crack, forming tunnels or passageways in the intestine walls. Crohn's disease can:

- Affect any part of the digestive tract, from the mouth to the anus, most commonly on parts of the small or large intestines.
- Affect all layers of the intestine walls, moving outward.
- Cause swelling in patches, leaving areas of healthy tissue. Severity of symptoms Symptoms usually come in waves, and can range from mild to severe, depending on where the affected area is and how badly it is damaged. Possible complications Crohn's disease can put people at increased risk of developing other health conditions. Most complications also occur in other types of IBD. These require extra monitoring.

The treatment for Crohn's disease usually controls some of the most common complications, such as: Ulcers. These are open sores that result from inflammation. Crohn's disease ulcers are deep lines that grow outward through the intestine wall. Anal fissures. This happens when inflammation creates small tears in the tissue lining the anus. This causes painful bowel movements and discomfort. Fistulas and Abscesses Abscesseshappen when an area damaged by inflammation gets infected, forming a puss-filled pocket that is usually swollen and painful. Fistulashappen when ulcers extend completely through the intestinal wall, creating a painful, abnormal passageway that connects to another body part. These can:

- Develop from the intestines to another organ or to the skin, even expanding outside the body.
- Have visible fluid draining out.
- Become inflected and fill with puss, forming an abscess.
- Develop from the intestines to another organ or to the skin, even expanding outside the body. If a complication becomes extremely severe or is left untreated, it may become life-threatening. Fistulas that develop in the stomach may become infected and form an abscess. This can cause digested food, fluids, or puss to leak inside the body. Complete intestinal obstructions occur when strictures narrow so much that the intestines actually become blocked. This prevents the movement of food and stool entirely.

5.4.1.1 Evidence for preoperative nutritional support

There are few prospective studies of preoperative nutrition and no prospective randomised trials with a non-nutrition control group. A meta-analysis of pre-surgical nutritional support in gastrointestinal surgery patients found that the provision of 500–1000 kcal of an immune enhancing oral nutritional supplement plus usual food significantly reduced post-surgical complications. A more recent systematic review of preoperative nutrition in Crohn's disease included 14 original studies, but only five prospective studies including one randomised trial. Five studies showed significantly reduced complications and infectious episodes in patients receiving preoperative nutritional therapy. Significant heterogeneity was reported between studies in terms of the nutritional supplement used and timing of nutrition. There is sufficient evidence to propose delaying surgery when possible to allow a multimodal approach to management including nutrition, steroid weaning and management of any abscesses.

The European Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ESPEN) recommends preoperative nutritional support for 7–10 days in patients who are undergoing major gastrointestinal surgery and are mildly malnourished. A longer duration is recommended for severely malnourished patients even if it delays surgery. If oral nutritional supplements are not tolerated, then enteral nutrition should be considered and parenteral nutrition should only be used when nutritional targets cannot be delivered by the enteral route.

5.4.2 Preoperative serum albumin

Hypoalbuminaemia (albumin < 30 g/L), as a reflection of significant inflammation or secondary to malabsorption, is frequently associated with severe malnutrition although is not in itself a marker of nutritional status. This level of hypoalbuminaemia is associated with a higher risk of postoperative intra-abdominal sepsis. The evidence to support the use of intravenous albumin is weakand correction of hypoalbuminaemia hinges on treatment of underlying sepsis and control of inflammation. Nutritional support alone is very unlikely to restore low albumin levels to normal while sepsis and uncontrolled inflammation persist, but feeding is an important supportive measure.

### Management of Crohn's disease in the new era of gut rehabilitation and intestinal transplantation [^113spXuT]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Despite recent therapeutic advances, patients with Crohn's disease (CD) continue to experience high recurrence with cumulative structural damage and ultimate loss of nutritional autonomy. With short bowel syndrome, strictures, and enteric fistulae being the underlying pathology, CD is the second common indication for home parenteral nutrition (HPN). With development of intestinal failure, nutritional management including HPN is required as a rescue therapy. Unfortunately, some patients do not escape the HPN-associated complications. Therefore, the concept of gut rehabilitation has evolved as part of the algorithmic management of these patients, with transplantation being the ultimate life-saving therapy. With type 2 intestinal failure, comprehensive rehabilitative measures including nutritional care, pharmacologic manipulation, autologous reconstruction, and bowel lengthening is often successful, particularly in patients with quiescent disease. With type 3 intestinal failure, transplantation is the only life-saving treatment for patients with HPN failure and intractable disease. With CD being the second common indication for transplantation in adults, survival outcome continues to improve because of surgical innovation, novel immunosuppression, and better postoperative care. Despite being a rescue therapy, the procedure has achieved survival rates similar to other solid organs, and comparable to those who continue to receive HPN therapy. With similar technical, immunologic, and infectious complications, survival is similar in the CD and non-CD recipients. Full nutritional autonomy is achievable in most survivors with better quality of life and long-term cost-effectiveness. CD recurrence is rare with no impact on graft function. Further progress is anticipated with new insights into the pathogenesis of CD and mechanisms of transplant tolerance.

Case Summary

A 61-year-old man presented with penetrating Crohn's ileocolitis and neoterminal ileal fibrostenotic stricture. He developed an anastomotic leak after a redo ileocolic resection and now has a chronic low-output enterocutaneous fistula. He was transferred from an outside institution for further management and is currently without Crohn's disease (CD)-related medical therapy. The fistula output is 25 to 50mL/day of GI contents. His weight dropped by 25 pounds in 6 months after surgery with a current BMI of 19.1, albumin of 2.0g/dL, and hemoglobin of 9.7g/dL. During a 3-month period, he was optimized for surgery with local wound care, initiation of infliximab, and nutritional support with exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN). He gained 9 pounds (BMI 20.4). Albumin improved to 3.4g/dL and hemoglobin to 12.1g/dL. He underwent a successful open takedown of the enterocutaneous fistula with ileocolic anastomosis.

There are several treatment options for intra-abdominal abscesses in CD. Previously, the majority of abscesses were treated with operative drainage, but with the improvement of interventional radiological techniques, the use of percutaneous drainage (PD) is increasing, associated with administration of antibiotics.

Success rates for PD in the literature vary from 74 to 100%. There are no RCTs comparing percutaneous and surgical drainage, but two meta-analyses tried to clarify the role of percutaneous drainage, compared to surgical management.

He et al. in 2015 aimed to compare clinical outcomes between PD alone and preoperative percutaneous drainage and initial surgery for patients with CD-related spontaneous intra-abdominal abscess, performed a meta-analysis of 9 (non-randomized and retrospective) studies including 513 patients and found a reduction in stoma creation rate and complication rate for patients undergoing pre-operative PD. The reason for these improved outcomes could be related to an improvement in patients' general and nutritional condition prior to definitive surgical intervention and to the control of the infectious source. Moreover, they reported that the risk for recurrent abscess was higher in patients who underwent PD alone than those who underwent initial surgery, highlighting that delayed abdominal surgery is almost inevitable in the majority of the patients presenting with intra-abdominal abscess.

Another meta-analysis, including six studies with a total of 333 patients was performed by Clancy et al. in 2016. They compared the use of PD alone and surgery in the management of patients presenting with a CD-related intra-abdominal abscess and reported an increased incidence of abscess recurrence for patients undergoing only PD, but interestingly, they also found that PD can successfully avoid surgery in 29.3% of patients. In addition, they found no significant difference in the overall complication rate, permanent stoma requirement, or length of stay between patients undergoing percutaneous drainage or immediate surgery.

PD (guided by US or CT) appears to be a relatively safe procedure as part of a bridge to surgery technique, but not all abscesses are "drainable" or "accessible". Effectiveness depends on abscess characteristics, such as location, number, size, presence of fistulae, or close proximity to vital structures.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) — enteral versus parenteral nutrition (PN) indications and thresholds are outlined as follows: Whenever possible, enteral nutrition (EN) is the preferred route of nutrition over PN, and if the gut is accessible and safe for use, it is the superior route for feeding and it can be used in combination with PN to help achieve nutritional intake goals. Explicit indications for PN support in the IBD adult population include intestinal failure, malnourishment with clear and definitive contraindications to EN, failure of EN to maintain or restore nutrition status, being unable to begin or keep nothing by mouth for at least 7 days before surgery, and when EN is not feasible or is insufficient to meet nutrient needs for at least 7–10 days; examples include high-output intestinal fistulae (> 500 mL/24 h), high stoma output (> 2000 mL/24 h), and inability to maintain > 60% of energy and protein goals via either oral nutrition or EN for 7–10 days.

### Initial management of intra-abdominal abscess in Crohn's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114L25Et]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Intra-abdominal abscess (IAA) is a serious complication of Crohn's disease (CD). Management strategies include medical therapy, percutaneous drainage (PD), and initial surgery, but the optimal approach is debated. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare these strategies.

Methods

A systematic search of 4 electronic databases was conducted. The primary outcome was the need for surgical intervention (resection or reoperation). Secondary outcomes included recurrence and complications. Data were pooled using random-effects models.

Results

Twenty-three studies were included. Compared with initial surgery, both PD (odds ratio [OR], 5.28; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.65–16.91) and medical management (antibiotics alone ± corticosteroids) (OR, 4.40; 95% CI, 1.25–15.45) were associated with significantly higher odds of requiring surgical intervention, relative to the reoperation rate in the surgery group. PD was associated with significantly lower odds of overall postintervention complications compared with initial surgery (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.96), with no significant difference in length of stay. Adjunctive exclusive enteral nutrition was associated with a significant reduction in the need for subsequent surgery (OR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.67). Pooled proportions for requiring subsequent surgery were 48% for medical management, 47% for PD, and 21% for the reoperation rate in the initial surgical group.

Conclusion

Initial surgical management is the most definitive treatment for CD-related IAA, with the lowest reoperation rates. PD serves as a less invasive bridge to surgery that reduces postintervention complications. Medical management alone is less effective and should be reserved for select patients.

### Nutrition and management of enterocutaneous fistula [^112azpcK]. The British Journal of Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The management of enterocutaneous fistula is challenging, with significant associated morbidity and mortality. This article reviews treatment, with emphasis on the provision and optimal route of nutritional support.

Methods

Relevant articles were identified using Medline searches. Secondary articles were identified from the reference lists of key papers.

Results and Conclusion

Management of enterocutaneous fistula should initially concentrate on correction of fluid and electrolyte imbalances, drainage of collections, treatment of sepsis and control of fistula output. The routine use of somatostatin infusion and somatostatin analogues remains controversial; although there are data suggesting reduced time to fistula closure, there is little evidence of increased probability of spontaneous closure. Malnutrition is common and adequate nutritional provision is essential, enteral where possible, although supplemental parenteral nutrition is often required for high-output small bowel fistulas. The role of immunonutrition is unknown. Surgical repair should be attempted when spontaneous fistula closure does not occur, but it should be delayed for at least 3 months.

### When is parenteral nutrition appropriate? [^113oJSSY]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Parenteral nutrition in other pediatric conditions — Outside of intestinal failure, PN use is limited to those who cannot tolerate adequate oral intake or enteral nutrition (EN) or who have preexisting malnutrition, including the critically ill and those with cancer, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), or renal failure. For patients receiving cancer treatment or after stem cell transplant, PN use is reserved for severe mucositis, typhlitis, intestinal obstruction, and intractable vomiting. In IBD, PN has little role except with fistula, obstruction, toxic megacolon, or bowel resection resulting in SBS. In pediatric chronic kidney disease, PN is indicated only if the child cannot take in enough enterally to prevent malnutrition when there is accompanying gastrointestinal dysfunction.

### Preoperative exclusive enteral nutrition is associated with reduced skin and soft tissue and intra-abdominal infections in patients with Crohn's disease undergoing intestinal surgery: results from a meta-analysis [^115vZRzQ]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Malnutrition is an independent risk factor for adverse postoperative outcomes and is common among patients with Crohn's disease (CD). The objective of this meta-analysis was to precisely quantify the association of preoperative exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with surgical outcomes in patients undergoing intestinal surgery for CD.

Methods

PubMed, Embase, and Scopus were queried for comparative studies evaluating the impact of preoperative nutritional support on postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing surgery for CD. Random effects modeling was used to compute pooled estimates of risk difference. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2.

Results

Fourteen studies, all nonrandomized cohort studies, met inclusion criteria for studying EEN. After pooling data from 14 studies (874 EEN treated and 1044 control patients), the relative risk of intra-abdominal septic complications was decreased 2.1-fold in patients receiving preoperative EEN (relative risk 0.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.35–0.63, I² = 0.0%). After pooling data from 9 studies (638 EEN treated and 819 control patients), the risk of skin and soft tissue infection was decreased 1.6-fold (relative risk 0.63; 95% CI, 0.42–0.94, I² = 42.7%). No significant differences were identified in duration of surgery, length of bowel resected, or operative blood loss. Among the 9 studies investigating TPN, no significant differences were identified in infectious outcomes.

Conclusions

Preoperative nutritional optimization with EEN was associated with reduced risk of infectious complications in CD patients undergoing intestinal surgery. Preoperative nutritional support with EEN should be considered for optimizing outcomes in CD patients requiring bowel resection surgery.

### Outcomes following surgery for perforating Crohn's disease [^113DjYj8]. The British Journal of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The most common indications for surgery for patients with ileocolic Crohn's disease are fibrostenotic or perforating disease. The objective was to compare surgical outcomes of patients with perforating versus non-perforating disease following ileocolic resection.

Methods

This was a retrospective review of all patients who had their first ileocolic resection between 1990 and 2010, identified from a prospectively maintained inflammatory bowel disease database. Demographic information, preoperative medication, intraoperative findings and postoperative outcome data were collected. Outcomes in patients who had an abscess drained before surgery or were found to have a fistula or abscess at surgery or at pathology were compared with outcomes in all others.

Results

A total of 434 patients (56.2 per cent women) were included, 293 with perforating and 141 with non-perforating disease. Median age, tobacco use, and preoperative steroid and biological agent use were similar in the two groups. Forty patients (13.7 per cent) in the perforating group had abscesses drained before surgery and 251 patients had at least one fistula, most commonly to the sigmoid colon. Patients with perforating disease were more likely to require preoperative total parenteral nutrition, need another resection, have an ileostomy and a longer mean postoperative stay, and less likely to undergo a laparoscopic procedure. Patients in this group also developed more postoperative abscesses or leaks (4.8 versus 0 per cent; P = 0.006). The reoperation rate was similar (3.1 versus 0.7 per cent; P = 0.178).

Conclusion

Patients with penetrating Crohn's disease are more likely to require a more complex procedure, and an ileostomy, and to a have longer postoperative stay.

### Nutritional management of Crohn's disease [^1136mBUp]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Nutritional care and therapy forms an integral part of the management of patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Nutritional deficiencies result from reduced oral intake, malabsorption, medication side effects and systemic inflammation due to active disease. Enteral nutrition has a role in support for the malnourished patient, as well as in primary therapy to induce and maintain remission. The use of parenteral nutrition in CD is mainly limited to the preoperative setting or for patients with intestinal failure, but does not offer any additional advantage over EN in disease control. Dietary modifications, including elimination-reintroduction diets and a low fermentable, oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) diet may improve symptoms but there are currently no data to suggest that these approaches have any role in the induction or maintenance of remission.

### The relevance of gastrointestinal fistulae in clinical practice: a review [^113AdiWM]. Gut (2001). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal fistulae most frequently occur as complications after abdominal surgery (75–85%) although they can also occur spontaneously — for example, in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) such as diverticulitis or following radiation therapy. Abdominal trauma can also lead to fistula formation although this is rare. Postoperative gastrointestinal fistulae can occur after any abdominal procedure in which the gastrointestinal tract is manipulated. Regardless of the cause, leakage of intestinal juices initiates a cascade of events: localised infection, abscess formation and, as a result of a septic focus, fistulae formation. The nature of the underlying disease may also be important, with some studies showing that fistula formation is more frequent following surgery for cancer than for benign disease. Fistula formation can result in a number of serious or debilitating complications, ranging from disturbance of fluid and electrolyte balance to sepsis and even death. The patient will almost always suffer from severe discomfort and pain. They may also have psychological problems, including anxiety over the course of their disease, and a poor body image due to the malodorous drainage fluid. Postoperative fistula formation often results in prolonged hospitalisation, patient disability, and enormous cost. Therapy has improved over time with the introduction of parental nutrition, intensive postoperative care, and advanced surgical techniques, which has reduced mortality rates. However, the number of patients suffering from gastrointestinal fistulae has not declined substantially. This can partially be explained by the fact that with improved care, more complex surgery is being performed on patients with more advanced or complicated disease who are generally at higher risk. Therefore, gastrointestinal fistulae remain an important complication following gastrointestinal surgery.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^115PYuqH]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Internal fistulas in Crohn's disease — rectovaginal, enterovesical, and enteroenteric — are outlined with limited trial data and a medical-first approach for rectovaginal disease: Internal fistulas originate between the bowel and a visceral organ and may occur in the form of rectovaginal fistulas, enterovesical fistulas, or enteroenteric fistulas. Limited clinical trial data exist for internal fistulizing CD, and most of the data stem from the early infliximab studies including the ACCENT II trial which included patients with rectovaginal fistula; therefore, infliximab with or without an immunomodulator tends to be recommended for these patients as an initial treatment approach before surgery. For patients with enterovesicular or colovesicular fistulas, recurrent symptomatic urinary tract infection is an indication for surgery especially if associated with pyelonephritis, and surgery usually involves resection of involved inflamed bowel and closure of the bladder defect. Enteroenteric fistulas are generally asymptomatic because they tend to form as sequelae of luminal inflammatory activity and typically do not require surgical management, whereas larger symptomatic internal fistulas can be associated with diarrhea, malnutrition, or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and may require more intensive management with nutritional support and medical and surgical interventions. The presence of high-output fistulas typically mandates surgical intervention (proximal bowel diversion, bowel segment resection, or surgical fistula closure) and historically they do not close spontaneously or with medical therapy.

### Preoperative hypoalbuminemia predicts 30-day complications in head and neck microvascular surgery [^117XUxe7]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

Managing Hypoalbuminemia

This study underscores the association between hypoalbuminemia and postoperative complications in head and neck microvascular reconstruction, aligning with findings across other surgical disciplines. Although the efficacy of interventions for optimizing nutritional status and hypoalbuminemia remains a subject of debate, there is evidence supporting the use of enteral and parenteral nutrition in improving outcomes for malnourished patients undergoing major elective surgeries. This requires a multidisciplinary care approach involving various health care providers to effectively manage nutritional challenges and optimize patient outcomes. A 1982 study demonstrated that preoperative total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for a minimum of 5 days significantly reduced postoperative complications in a cohort of inflammatory bowel disease patients with hypoalbuminemia, suggesting similar potential benefits for head and neck reconstruction patients. Similarly, a study on Crohn's disease patients revealed that preoperative TPN, administered 18 to 90 days prior to surgery, significantly lowered postoperative complications compared with a control group. The European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism advises administering preoperative nutrition therapy, preferably enteral, for 10 to 14 days before surgery in cases of severe nutritional risk, even if it means delaying the surgery. However, the use of exogenous albumin to correct preoperative hypoalbuminemia has not shown to alter hospitalization outcomes and is not recommended for treating malnutrition. Alongside these clinical considerations, shared decision‐making plays a critical role, especially given the high morbidity of head and neck reconstruction surgeries. Involving patients in the decision‐making process, particularly those with compromised nutrition, is imperative. This patient‐driven approach ensures that they are well‐informed about the risks and benefits, allowing for a more personalized and effective treatment plan.

### Fistuloclysis can successfully replace parenteral feeding in the nutritional support of patients with enterocutaneous fistula [^117YGQ17]. The British Journal of Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Use of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) in patients with acute intestinal failure due to enteric fistulation might be avoided if a simpler means of nutritional support was available. The aim of this study was to determine whether feeding via an intestinal fistula (fistuloclysis) would obviate the need for TPN.

Methods

Fistuloclysis was attempted in 12 patients with jejunocutaneous or ileocutaneous fistulas with mucocutaneous continuity. Feeding was achieved by inserting a gastrostomy feeding tube into the intestine distal to the fistula. Infusion of enteral feed was increased in a stepwise manner, without reinfusion of chyme, until predicted nutritional requirements could be met by a combination of fistuloclysis and regular diet, following which TPN was withdrawn. Energy requirements and nutritional status were assessed before starting fistuloclysis and at the time of reconstructive surgery.

Results

Fistuloclysis replaced TPN entirely in 11 of 12 patients. Nutritional status was maintained for a median of 155 (range 19–422) days until reconstructive surgery could be safely undertaken in nine patients. Two patients who did not undergo surgery remained nutritionally stable over at least 9 months. TPN had to be recommenced in one patient. There were no complications associated with fistuloclysis.

Conclusion

Fistuloclysis appears to provide effective nutritional support in selected patients with enterocutaneous fistula.

### Identifying outcomes in clinical trials of fistulizing Crohn's disease for the development of a core outcome set [^114JoZvL]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Fistulizing complications develop in approximately one third of patients with Crohn's disease (CD), resulting in morbidity and impaired quality of life. 1 Sites of fistulae most commonly include perianal fistulae, but also enterocutaneous, enteroenteric, enterovesical, and rectovaginal. Its management requires combined medical and surgical strategies to prevent abscess formation and induce healing. Biologic agents have improved the medical treatment of CD-related fistulae, but many patients still require surgical intervention. Hence, there is considerable interest in the development of novel pharmaceutical agents to treat fistulizing CD.

### The role of open abdomen in non-trauma patient: WSES consensus paper [^112MHra2]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Fig. 1
Open Abdomen classification according to Bjork et al.

EAF is a poorly predictable and, above all, avoidable complication. When patients develop EAF, an accurate and tailored management scheme should be adopted. Nutrition plays a key role in the management of these patients and should be always kept in mind as a fundamental part of the treatment. The open abdomen strategy may result in fluid and electrolytes loss resulting in acid-base derangements. The anatomy and the characteristics of the EAF(s) should be defined in order to plan the best treatment option. Parenteral nutrition (TPN) should be started immediately after the patient resuscitation. Enteral nutrition in OA patients has been well studied demonstrating a reduction in infectious complications preserving the intestinal mucosal barrier and its immunological function. Enteral nutrition in patients with an EAF is has but may increase fistula output. Only small series of patients with EAF treated with EN exists; therefore, no strong evidence can support these treatments and further studies are needed. The use of octreotide analogs is controversial. No evidence exists about the use of somatostatin and octreotide in managing of EAF. Few studies suggest that octreotide may reduce fistula output by diminishing GI secretions while others argue their benefit due to this agents' reduction in splanchnic blood flow and reduction in immune function.

The main goal in the management of EAF should be the closure of the fistula. Differently from common GI fistulas, the EAF is not a true fistula since a fistula tract does not exist. The lack of surrounding tissues prevents the spontaneous closure. The goal of the treatment should be focused on trying to isolate the fistula effluent and enhancing the formation of granulation tissues surrounding it. Several different techniques were described and proposed in the literature to control and treat EAF, and some attempts to standardize its management exist. A patient diagnosed with EAF in the setup of OA should be treated by medical personnel familiar with this complication and its consequences.

Accurate fistula definition and anatomy should be made. Sepsis control and management is important. Diversion of the fistula output in order to maintain clean the peritoneal cavity is mandatory. Fistula effluent should be measured in order to facilitate fluid balance and to ensure skin protection from its digestive nature on the skin. This will enhance and allow better patient care and mobility.

### Recurrent pneumonia and colobronchial fistula from Crohn's disease: infliximab alters and simplifies surgical management [^115ZwbRC]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

Although colobronchial fistulas are a rare complication of Crohn's disease, they should be highly suspected in patients with chronic respiratory symptoms and poorly controlled Crohn's disease. Diagnostic tests to determine pneumonia secondary to enteric fistula should include a chest radiograph, bronchoscopy, and sputum cultures consistent with enteric organisms. In this case, suspected colobronchial fistula was confirmed by abdominal CT enterography, an excellent tool for imaging complex Crohn's disease patients. Half of the reported cases of visualized colobronchial fistulas used barium or gastrographin enema; the remainder visualized them using abdominal CT. The majority of fistulas are to the left chest, presumably because the liver protects the right diaphragm from the inflammatory process.

In all previous eight cases of colobronchial fistula, surgery was the standard of care and included bowel resection of the segment involved in the fistula trajectory and often diaphragmatic and pulmonary wedge resection. One case did attempt, but failed, to close colobronchial fistula medically with one month of 6-mercapropurine. In our case, because of the poor nutritional state and the severity of Crohn's disease, medical management, to include TPN and infliximab, was our initial goal until optimal conditions for surgery were attained. Infliximab and other TNF-blocking agents have shown dramatic results in some patients with Crohn's disease. Infliximab appears to have great utility in unusual cases of fistulizing Crohn's disease, although it does not replace surgery in most cases because of recurrence. The current patient's treatment with infliximab resulted in dramatic clinical improvement and likely changed the type of surgery required. Although the patient's clinical course indicated possible healing of the colobronchial fistula, the additional multiple colocolonic fistulas required a surgical solution. Ultimately, a completion colectomy and debridement of the fistula were simplified by previous medical management with infliximab. No pulmonary, liver, or diaphragmatic resections were needed.

In conclusion, medical management with immunosuppressive therapy using infliximab is a successful pre-operative adjunct to surgical management for treatment of colobronchial fistula in patients with Crohn's disease and recurrent pneumonia. The use of this class of TNF-blocking agents may simplify the surgical approach in patients with complicated fistulous Crohn's disease.

Background

The management of patients with enterocutaneous fistula (ECF) requires an interdisciplinary approach and poses a significant challenge to physicians, wound/stoma care specialists, dietitians, pharmacists, and other nutrition clinicians. Guidelines for optimizing nutrition status in these patients are often vague, based on limited and dated clinical studies, and typically rely on individual institutional or clinician experience. Specific nutrient requirements, appropriate route of feeding, role of immune-enhancing formulas, and use of somatostatin analogues in the management of patients with ECF are not well defined. The purpose of this clinical guideline is to develop recommendations for the nutrition care of adult patients with ECF.

Methods

A systematic review of the best available evidence to answer a series of questions regarding clinical management of adults with ECF was undertaken and evaluated using concepts adopted from the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group. An anonymous consensus process was used to develop the clinical guideline recommendations prior to peer review and approval by the ASPEN Board of Directors and by FELANPE.

Questions

In adult patients with enterocutaneous fistula: (1) What factors best describe nutrition status? (2) What is the preferred route of nutrition therapy (oral diet, enteral nutrition, or parenteral nutrition)? (3) What protein and energy intake provide best clinical outcomes? (4) Is fistuloclysis associated with better outcomes than standard care? (5) Are immune-enhancing formulas associated with better outcomes than standard formulas? (6) Does the use of somatostatin or somatostatin analogue provide better outcomes than standard medical therapy? (7) When is home parenteral nutrition support indicated?

### French national consensus clinical guidelines for the management of Crohn's disease [^112bQ91c]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic and disabling condition. There is no curative medical treatment but current treatments provide increasingly sustainable control of the disease and allow patients a better quality of life. There is limited evidence supporting CD management in specific clinical situations, thus precluding an evidence-based approach.

Aims

To help clinicians in making informed treatment decisions, a group of 59 French gastroenterologists with experience in the management of CD met to develop straightforward and practical algorithms based on the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) recommendations.

Methods

This experts' opinion was developed following a Nominal Group consensus methodology. Nine clinical situations were identified: mildly active CD; uncomplicated moderately active CD, with, and without poor prognostic factors; uncomplicated severely active CD; perianal CD with a single fistula; perianal CD with complex fistula with or without abscess; complicated CD with abscess; intestinal stricture; and post-operative CD. Two working groups were formed and proposed algorithms that were then approved by a two-thirds majority of the Nominal Group.

Results

These algorithms represent the pragmatic consensus of a group of experts in gastroenterology on the modalities of therapeutic care in different clinical situations in CD. They are available via a web application at: www.algorithmici.com.

### WSES-AAST guidelines: management of inflammatory bowel disease in the emergency setting [^115ddtwG]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

In clinical practice, MRE is frequently used in the outpatient setting. The lack of radiation and the excellent quality of images are advantages of this technique. This is particularly applied for evaluation of the small bowel and perineum. However, the use in an emergency setting is limited due to the oral contrast, increased study time, costs, and lack of availability.

In stable patients presenting with signs of GI hemorrhage, CT angiography should be considered to localize the bleeding site before angio-embolization or surgery, when an endoscopic evaluation is not possible and the patient is unable to tolerate the bowel preparation. A systematic review showed high sensitivity (85.2%) and high specificity (92.1%) of CT angiography for diagnosing acute gastrointestinal bleeding.

Endoscopy may be of added value as a diagnostic procedure for selected patients with IBD presenting with lower GI-bleeding in an emergency setting. A full colonoscopy is usually not possible given the need for oral bowel preparation prior to the colonoscopy, as well as the inability for oral intake of large volumes. However, a flexible sigmoidoscopy is possible with preparation with an enema. This procedure can aid in establishing the level and location of disease activity in UC and distal colonic CD and to detect preoperatively a source of bleeding. In addition, it can be used to rule out other conditions such as colonic ischemia, infections, and cancer. Finally, biopsies may be obtained for histologic assessment. A sigmoidoscopy will come with insufflation so should therefore not be applied in patients with obstruction or toxic megacolon given the increased risk of intestinal perforation.

Q.3: Which is the role of interventional radiology in the management of intra-abdominal abscesses related to Crohn's disease in the emergency setting?

Statement 3.1

Percutaneous drainage associated with antimicrobial treatment should be considered as a first-line treatment in the management of abscesses related to Crohn's disease, in stable patients (QoE C).

Statement 3.2

Small abscesses (< 3 cm) could be treated with intravenous antibiotics with a risk of recurrence, especially if associated with enteric fistula (QoE B)

Statement 3.3

Percutaneous drainage of abscesses > 3 cm could avoid immediate surgery and should be used as a bridging procedure before elective surgery to reduce the need for stoma creation and limit intestinal resection in malnourished and high-risk patients (QoE C).

### British society of gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^116PSHpQ]. Gut (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for enterocutaneous fistula, more specifically with respect to immunosuppressive therapy, BSG 2019 guidelines recommend to consider initiating anti-TNF therapy to control inflammation or maintain remission in the setting of non-perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease.
