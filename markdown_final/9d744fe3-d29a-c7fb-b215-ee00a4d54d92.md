## Question

can you access a dialysis shunt in the ed to give med

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is appropriate to access a dialysis shunt (arteriovenous fistula or graft) in the emergency department to administer medications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the types of dialysis access and their intended uses. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about using AV access for non-dialysis purposes. Next, I will consider infection risk, bleeding risk, and the potential for access damage. After that, I should review emergency scenarios where exceptions might apply. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation for ED practice and note any documentation or follow-up considerations.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't misstate anything: a "dialysis shunt" in common usage refers to an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or arteriovenous graft (AVG), which are high-flow, surgically created conduits designed exclusively for hemodialysis cannulation, whereas central venous catheters (CVCs) are separate devices used when AV access is not available or not ready; I need to ensure I'm not conflating CVCs with AVF/AVG when discussing medication administration [^c675d354] [^742abed2].

> Next, I should review the purpose and stewardship principles for AV access. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: AVFs and AVGs are the preferred long-term access because they provide reliable dialysis with lower complication rates than catheters, and guidelines emphasize protecting them from trauma, infection, and unnecessary interventions; they are not intended for routine IV medication administration outside of dialysis sessions [^742abed2] [^b2ac7c5b].

> I will now examine whether any guideline supports using AV access for non-dialysis medication delivery. Wait, let me verify: KDOQI and contemporary vascular access guidance focus on cannulation technique, complication prevention, and access salvage; they do not endorse using AVF/AVG for routine medication administration, and instead prioritize preserving access integrity and minimizing cannulations that could cause infiltration, infection, or thrombosis [^511101f7] [^b21b6389].

> But wait, what if the patient has no other viable access and the situation is life-threatening? I should double-check the risk-benefit framing: AV access carries risks of bleeding, infection, and structural injury with each needle stick; infiltration and hematoma can compromise future dialysis, and infection can lead to loss of the access; thus, even in emergencies, using AV access for meds should be a last resort after exhausting peripheral, ultrasound-guided peripheral, intraosseous, and central venous options, and only if the clinical benefit clearly outweighs the risk of access loss [^511101f7] [^b21b6389].

> Let me consider the infection dimension carefully. I need to ensure I'm not underestimating it: dialysis patients have high rates of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, and CVCs drive much of that risk; while AVF/AVG have lower infection risk than CVCs, introducing a needle for non-dialysis purposes still breaches aseptic technique and can seed infection, so the threshold for using AV access for meds should be exceptionally high and accompanied by strict sterile technique if absolutely necessary [^65003552] [^b05c917b].

> Next, I should review emergency contexts where exceptions are sometimes discussed. Hold on, I should verify specifics: in life-threatening hemorrhage from an access site, ED teams may temporize with pressure, sutures, tourniquets, or clamps while arranging definitive control; this is hemorrhage control, not medication administration, and it underscores how precious and fragile these accesses are rather than supporting routine medication use [^eedb6499] [^41d2d164].

> I will now examine practical alternatives so I don't overstate the need to use AV access. Let me think about the hierarchy: standard peripheral IVs, ultrasound-guided peripheral IVs, intraosseous access, and central venous catheters (preferably not dialysis CVCs unless already in place) are appropriate routes for emergency medications; in acute kidney injury requiring dialysis, guidelines still prefer a tunneled dialysis catheter rather than repurposing an AVF/AVG for non-dialysis needs, reinforcing that AV access should remain dedicated to dialysis [^822c9ba4] [^796c0cfd].

> Synthesizing this, I should confirm the bottom line: No, it is not appropriate to access a dialysis shunt (AVF or AVG) in the ED to give medications except in rare, life-threatening scenarios when no other viable access exists and the benefit clearly outweighs the substantial risks of bleeding, infection, infiltration, and access loss; if such an exception is made, it should be documented as a last-resort decision with rationale, and nephrology should be notified for access surveillance afterward [^742abed2] [^511101f7].

---

In general, **do not use a dialysis shunt for medication administration** in the ED unless there is no alternative and the patient is in extremis. Dialysis shunts (AVF/AVG) are high-risk, specialized conduits for dialysis only; using them for IV meds risks **bleeding, infection, thrombosis, and loss of access**. If no other access is available, use strict aseptic technique, avoid the arterial side, and limit to a single dose with immediate nephrology consultation. Central venous catheters are **preferred for emergencies** when peripheral access fails.

---

## Risks associated with using dialysis shunts for medication administration

Using dialysis shunts for medication administration carries **significant risks**, including:

- **Bleeding and hematoma**: Shunts have high flow and pressure; needle injury can cause rapid, life-threatening bleeding or hematoma [^eedb6499].

- **Infection**: Shunts are prone to infection; introducing non-sterile needles increases bacteremia and sepsis risk [^65003552].

- **Thrombosis and loss of access**: Needle trauma or infection can precipitate thrombosis, risking permanent access loss and need for temporary catheters [^notfound].

- **Steal syndrome**: Cannulation can worsen ischemia in patients with underlying steal syndrome [^32bb4505].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Major guidelines (KDOQI, SVS) **advise against using AV fistulas or grafts for medication administration** except in rare, life-threatening emergencies when no other access exists. They emphasize:

- **AVF/AVG are for dialysis only**: Not for routine IV access or medication administration [^notfound].

- **Central venous catheters for emergencies**: Use CVCs when peripheral access fails or urgent dialysis is needed [^822c9ba4].

- **Strict aseptic technique**: If a shunt must be used in extremis, use sterile technique and avoid the arterial side.

---

## Situations where using a dialysis shunt may be considered

Use of a dialysis shunt for medication administration should be **reserved for extreme emergencies** when:

- **No other access**: Peripheral, ultrasound-guided, and intraosseous attempts have failed.

- **Life-threatening instability**: Immediate medication is required (e.g. cardiac arrest, severe sepsis, anaphylaxis).

- **Single-dose scenario**: Limit to one dose with immediate nephrology consultation.

---

## Alternative vascular access options in the ED

When a dialysis shunt is present, **prioritize alternatives**:

| **Access method** | **Indications** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Peripheral IV | First-line for most medications | - Low risk <br/> - Quick | May be difficult in ESRD |
| Ultrasound-guided peripheral IV | Difficult IV access | - Visualized placement <br/> - Lower failure | Still limited by vein quality |
| Intraosseous (IO) | Cardiac arrest, severe shock | - Rapid <br/> - Reliable | Pain, infection, device failure |
| Central venous catheter (CVC) | - Failed peripheral <br/> - Need for central access | - Reliable <br/> - High flow | Infection, pneumothorax, thrombosis |

---

## Best practices if a dialysis shunt must be used

If no alternative exists and a shunt must be used, **follow these precautions**:

- **Aseptic technique**: Full sterile prep and draping.

- **Avoid arterial side**: Cannulate the venous limb only.

- **Limit to single dose**: Do not leave an indwelling catheter.

- **Immediate nephrology consultation**: For assessment and surveillance.

- **Document rationale**: Record the indication and consent.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Dialysis shunts should **not be used for medication administration** in the ED except in rare, life-threatening emergencies when no other access is available. The risks of bleeding, infection, thrombosis, and access loss are substantial. Use CVCs, IO, or ultrasound-guided peripheral access whenever possible, and if a shunt is used, apply strict aseptic technique, avoid the arterial side, and involve nephrology immediately.

Ascites, ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts, and peritoneal dialysis — preplacement risk considerations — can present challenges and require specific precautions: the presence of ascites, ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts, and peritoneal dialysis can present challenges, including translocation of bacteria and increased risk of infectious complications; the presence of ascites can impair wound healing and apposition of the gastric wall to the abdominal wall, so ascitic fluid should be drained via paracentesis or intraperitoneal drain placement, and T-tacks can be used to improve tract formation; data support placement of a gastrostomy concurrently with a VP shunt or before VP shunt placement compared with within 15 days after VP shunt placement; with respect to individuals on peritoneal dialysis, converting to or maintaining individuals on hemodialysis for 6 weeks reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of peritonitis.

### Declotting the thrombosed access [^84a6c8a1]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Because a patent access is the lifeline for a dialysis patient, access declotting is extremely important. Before embarking on a declot, it is important to evaluate the patient for potential contraindications such as pulmonary hypertension, right-to-left shunts and access infection in order to be able to avoid potential complications such as symptomatic pulmonary embolism, stroke, and sepsis. Multiple methods to perform a percutaneous declot exist. Four common methods are described here. We also discuss how to avoid causing an arterial embolism and how to treat it if it does occur.

### Preventing arteriovenous shunt failure in hemodialysis patients: a population-based cohort study [^861377a1]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2019). Medium credibility.

Essentials Uncertainty remains about antiplatelets for vascular access patency in hemodialysis patients. 95 971 people under hemodialysis were followed in a claims database in Taiwan. Aspirin reduced vascular access failure rate and did not increase major bleeding rate. Clopidogrel, Aggrenox, and warfarin might increase major bleeding rate. SUMMARY: Background Dialysis adequacy is a major determinant of survival for patients with end-stage renal disease. Good vascular access is essential to achieve adequate dialysis. Objectives This study evaluated the impacts of different drugs on the vascular access failure rate of an arteriovenous fistula or an arteriovenous graft and the rate of major bleeding in hemodialysis patients. Patients and methods We studied patients with end-stage renal disease registered in the Taiwan National Health Insurance program from 1 January 1997 to 31 December 2012. A total of 95 971 patients were enrolled in our study. Vascular access dysfunction was defined as the need for thrombectomy or percutaneous angioplasty. Major bleeding was defined as emergency department visits or hospitalization with a primary diagnosis of gastrointestinal bleeding or intracerebral hemorrhage. The adjusted odds ratios between person-quarters with or without antiplatelet or oral anticoagulant use were calculated using a generalized estimating equation. Results The odds ratio of vascular access failure was 0.21 (0.11–0.39) for aspirin, 0.76 (0.74–0.79) for clopidogrel, 0.67 (0.59–0.77) for dipyridamole, 0.67 (0.53–0.86) for Aggrenox and 0.96 (0.90–1.03) for warfarin. The highest odds ratio for intracerebral hemorrhage was 5.33 (1.25–22.72) in younger patients using Aggrenox. The highest odds ratio for gastrointestinal bleeding was 1.34 (1.10–1.64) for clopidogrel. Conclusion Antiplatelet agents, but not warfarin, might reduce the vascular access thrombosis rate. The gastrointestinal bleeding rate was increased in the group using clopidogrel. Aggrenox should be used with caution in young individuals because it might increase the rate of intracerebral hemorrhage.

### Vital signs: health disparities in hemodialysis-… [^65003552]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary What is already known about this topic. Racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected by end-stage kidney disease, and patients on dialysis are at increased risk for Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections. Hemodialysis access type is a well-established risk factor for bloodstream infections, with central venous catheters having the highest associated risk. Areas with higher poverty levels, crowding, and lower education levels accounted for disproportionately higher proportions of hemodialysis-associated S. aureus bloodstream infections. Conclusions and implications for public health practice: Disparities exist in hemodialysis-associated S. aureus infections. Health care providers and public health professionals should prioritize prevention and optimized treatment of ESKD, identify and address barriers to lower-risk vascular access placement, and implement established best practices to prevent bloodstream infections.

Introduction More than 800, 000 persons in the United States live with ESKD, 70% of whom are treated with dialysis; 30% have a functioning kidney transplant. Black persons constitute 33% of all U. S. patients receiving dialysis, but only 12% of the U. S. population. Although it is well established that race, ethnicity, and social determinants of health affect the development of ESKD and treatment options. Overall, improved surveillance through closer linkage of existing relevant data sources and more granular surveillance data capture, especially through automated reporting, would provide additional insight to address health disparities through specific public health interventions without increasing reporting responsibilities for health care providers. Because disparities can affect ESKD development, access to treatment options, and risk of hemodialysis bloodstream infections, a comprehensive approach to preventive care that recognizes racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities is needed. This approach could include continued efforts to prevent and improve management of underlying conditions such as diabetes and hypertension, improved access to care for prevention and early recognition and treatment of chronic kidney disease, and increased availability of optimal treatments for ESKD, particularly in areas of lower SES.

### Non-traumatic vascular emergencies: management of occluded hemodialysis shunts and venous access [^ed325216]. European Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Shunt thrombosis is a relatively frequent complication of implant grafts but less common in native fistulas; both may undergo mechanical recanalization without thrombolysis. While in native fistulas, simple balloon angioplasty is a very useful tool for short-segment thrombosis, extensive thrombosis in native veins or grafts requires use of different mechanical devices or aspiration catheters. In venous access thrombosis, thrombolysis or fibrinous sheath stripping are percutaneous options.

### Is transcellular potassium shifting with insulin, albuterol, or sodium bicarbonate in emergency department patients with hyperkalemia associated with recurrent hyperkalemia after dialysis? [^f75b13ca]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Emergency department (ED) treatment of hyperkalemia often involves shifting potassium into the intracellular space. There is uncertainty whether transcellular shifting causes insufficient potassium removal during hemodialysis, resulting in a subsequent need for further medical therapy or multiple sessions of hemodialysis.

Objective

We sought to determine whether transcellular potassium shifting in ED patients with hyperkalemia who undergo hemodialysis is associated with recurrent hyperkalemia with or without repeat hemodialysis within 24 h.

Methods

This was a retrospective observational study of ED patients with a potassium value > 5.3 mmol/L and ≥ 1 hemodialysis run. Transcellular shifting medications were defined as albuterol, insulin, and sodium bicarbonate. Primary outcomes were recurrent hyperkalemia with and without repeat hemodialysis within 24 h of the initial dialysis run. Generalized estimating equation models were created for the outcomes using administration of a shifting medication as the primary predictor.

Results

Four hundred seventy-nine encounters were identified. In 238 (50%) encounters, a shifting medication was administered. There were 85 outcomes of recurrent hyperkalemia and 36 outcomes of recurrent hyperkalemia with repeat hemodialysis. After adjustment, administration of shifting medications was not associated with recurrent hyperkalemia (adjusted odds ratio 1.26, 95% confidence interval 0.71–2.23) or recurrent hyperkalemia with repeat dialysis (adjusted odds ratio 1.90, 95% confidence interval 0.80–4.48).

Conclusions

Administration of transcellular shifting medications for hyperkalemia in the ED was not associated with either recurrent hyperkalemia after hemodialysis or the need for a second dialysis session within 24 h. Our findings address the uncertainty regarding transcellular potassium shifting before emergent dialysis and support safe ED administration of medications that shift potassium to the intracellular space.

### The emergency department care for hemodialysis patient during the COVID-19 pandemic [^91ea9074]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic poses significant challenges to patients with end-stage kidney disease who receive treatment in outpatient dialysis centers. These patients represent a fragile population that is at higher risk for both infection and transmission. At the start of the pandemic, many suspected COVID-19 dialysis patients were diverted to the emergency department (ED) for testing/treatment, placing a tremendous burden on the ED and inpatient dialysis units. Several recommendations and guidelines have been established to optimize patient care while also decreasing the burden on the ED and inpatient dialysis units and maximizing the ability to perform outpatient hemodialysis. As the pandemic continues, dialysis facilities will have an increasing burden to provide safe and accessible dialysis, while also being able to direct patients to the ED for either emergent dialysis or COVID-19 treatment/testing. We reviewed opinions, recommendations and guidelines developed by professional organizations and dialysis facilities for the management of "patients under investigation" (PUIs) and COVID-19 positive patients that depend on whether the suspicion occurs while the patient is at home vs. at the dialysis center.

### Dialysis therapy: its past, present, and future? my personal recollection of dialysis therapy [^d6802577]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2019). Medium credibility.

In Dr Ohira's era, hemodialysis was done using an external arteriovenous shunt. External arteriovenous shunts surely made repeated hemodialysis possible, but they also brought about serious complications which necessarily produced the arteriovenous fistula. Arteriovenous fistula is definitely the most important contribution to long-term survival of the hemodialysis patient. Hemodialysis therapy soon became very common, so that various kinds of patients appeared for it. Then came the era of arteriovenous grafts, because many patients lost good vessels in order to create the arteriovenous fistula. More grafts are now becoming available, which are made from different materials and in different forms, thus creating greater expectations for the future. Unfortunately, at this time, the revolutionary vascular access surpassing the arteriovenous fistula has yet to appear and we must continue to make proper application of the arteriovenous fistula. Vascular access is surely one of the important factors to assure a smooth dialysis life for patients. So, we must recognize that we play an important role in the dialysis patients' life. It is interesting to note that in every country, medical care exceeds physical care. This means that the mental factor somewhat compensates for the physical factor. Dr Ohira was a vascular surgeon, but he was also interested in the activities of daily living and quality of life, which must be one of the most delicate fields in medicine.

### Evidence for the prevention and treatment of stroke in dialysis patients [^eaeee555]. Seminars in Dialysis (2014). Low credibility.

Vascular Access

Vascular access may increase stroke risk through multiple mechanisms. First, data from a period when antibacterial catheter locks were less widely used found about one in 10 strokes in dialysis patients were related to endocarditis. Secondly, a stroke at the time of a vascular access procedure should prompt investigation for a persistent patent foramen ovale. Lastly, vascular access may also affect cerebral hemodynamics: a Japanese hospital stroke registry examined 1168 new strokes including 151 among maintenance hemodialysis. Of the 86 ischemic strokes in hemodialysis patients, vertebrobasilar disease made up 43% of strokes, compared to 33% of those not on dialysis. The authors raised the hypothesis (that clearly needs further testing) that arteriovenous vascular access may account for this possible difference, perhaps by altering flow velocity of the vertebral artery as a result of low shunt resistance.

Implementation considerations — Primary goal of vascular access creation and planning is to create a functional vascular access that can provide reliable prescribed dialysis, with minimal interventions and complications. Outcomes of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and arteriovenous graft (AVG) may differ if interventions were required before use, and until further comparative study is available, caution should be made in generalizing outcomes reported without this consideration.

### Preparing a dialysis patient [^a5268fc5]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Preparing a dialysis patient for access placement is a process that should ideally begin well before the need for access use. Unfortunately, this is often not the case and patients are often seen well after dialysis has been initiated with a catheter. The process should include a detail-oriented history and a thorough vascular oriented physical examination. A complete history and physical exam will help tailor access options in individual patients. The KDOQI guideline structures the selection and timing of dialysis access, ensuring each patient's medical circumstances and preferences are taken into account. The preparation of a dialysis patient should also include discussion with the patient in regard to their values and expectations before coming to a life-long plan for the patient. This holistic approach aims to achieve reliable and functioning access while preserving future options and improving patient outcomes. This following review will cover the elements of both as well as adjunctive imaging modalities and their indications to allow for successful access placement.

### Dialysis access – guidelines for current practice [^b5b1903b]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Current guidelines promote the use of the native arteriovenous fistula (AVF) as the first choice for access over grafts and central venous catheters. However, the prevalence of AVF use shows enormous differences among national, regional and local practice surveys, even after adjusting for demographics. In this review, we will briefly discuss these differences and present actions potentially improving outcome of vascular access care.

KDOQI vascular access — the patient already on hemodialysis with a CVC (Figure 1.3): The algorithm asks "Is an AV access appropriate and possible? Central stenosis, potential access locations, medically & surgically feasible?" If "No", "Continue with CVC". If "Yes", assess "Is this patient a good AVF candidate?" If not, "Consider AVG", then ask "Is secondary AVF possible when AVG becomes problematic?" with "No" leading to "Continue with AVG" and "Yes" to "Consider AVF"; if a candidate, proceed to "Consider AVF". Footnotes note "Location needs to consider subsequent accesses placements" and "May use app for guidance".

### Novel therapies for hemodialysis vascular access dysfunction: myth or reality? [^a35d3c85]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Hemodialysis vascular access dysfunction is a major source of morbidity for patients with ESRD. Development of effective approaches to prevent and treat vascular access failure requires an understanding of the underlying mechanisms, suitable models for preclinical testing, systems for targeted delivery of interventions to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity, and rigorous clinical trials that use appropriate outcome measures. This article reviews the substantial progress and ongoing challenges in developing novel treatments for arteriovenous vascular access failure and focuses on localized rather than systemic interventions.

### Giant brachial artery aneurysm as a rare complication of a dialysis shunt [^572753de]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2020). Medium credibility.

Our patient exhibited a large tumor on his right upper arm where his former dialysis access site had been. X-ray, Doppler ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging scan could not fully reveal the nature of that tumor. Eventually, a surgical approach showed a giant aneurysm of the inflowing brachial artery to a partially obliterated arteriovenous fistula. This case highlights the importance of ongoing care for patients with arteriovenous shunts. Even arteriovenous fistulas, that are obliterated or no longer in use, can, especially when immunosuppressant therapy and other vascular risk factors are added to the overall cardiovascular risk, transform and endanger the health of our patients.

### Intradialytic techniques for automatic and everyday access monitoring [^06fad86e]. Seminars in Dialysis (2023). Medium credibility.

4.3 Repeated multivariable studies

The SHUNT‐STUDY used on‐line clearance‐based dose of dialysis (K eff t / V) together with thermodilution‐based recirculation (R BTM) to identify arterio‐venous fistulae at risk. The study is outstanding as 101 patients were prospectively studied every treatment session for the duration of 1 year using two criteria for fistula assessment. Data were collected by a commercial monitoring system. To exclude measuring errors, the criterion had to be met in one to more than five consecutive sessions. A drop in K eff t / V by more than 0.4 units for two or more sessions was highly specific for access failure, but no drop in K eff t / V or a drop in K eff t / V in up to five consecutive dialysis sessions had discriminative ability for pending access failure. Baseline R BTM > 15% conferred significantly reduced access survival. The absolute increase in recirculation by 5%, 10%, and 15% in the follow‐up period was highly specific for access failure, but again, a clear threshold could not be identified. The sensitivity of R BTM to detect accesses at risk was poor.

Overall, this looks like a negative study, but the focus on changes in R BTM rather than absolute thresholds may have blurred the sensitivity of the recirculation test: The same increase in recirculation (for example 5%) has different implications for a baseline recirculation far below or close to the critical threshold of 15%. It is not clear why the 15% threshold was abandoned in the follow‐up period. Also notice that variables such as V and t, both affecting K eff t / V, were not controlled. A dialysis practitioner may therefore have masked a fall in K eff t / V by increasing dialysis time, for example, and inadvertently reduced the sensitivity of the test for access failure.

### Beyond the technical: determining real indications for vascular access and hemodialysis initiation in end-stage renal disease [^98e08f24]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Determining valid indications for vascular access creation and hemodialysis initiation in end-stage renal disease requires utilization of verified prognostication tools and recognition of triggers to initiate serious conversations, and implementation of concurrent palliative care and/or hospice care is recommended. Establishment of a multi-disciplinary team that includes consideration of interventionalists in the pre-dialysis medical situation is important. A "catheter best" approach may be the most appropriate for some patients to meet goals of care.

A mature graft is defined as one that "can provide prescribed dialysis consistently with 2 needles for more than two thirds of dialysis sessions within 4 consecutive weeks".

Rationale

Rather than the technology of membranes, pumps and water purification, the history of dialysis is most closely associated with the development of vascular access. It was not until Belding Scribner's development of a continuously flowing arterio-venous shunt that long term dialysis became possible, and the exponential growth in dialysis numbers in the last quarter of the 20th century owes as much to two further access inventions, the fistula and the catheter, as it does to medical or political will. Many excellent histories are available but in summary, as the modern era of dialysis was beginning around 1980, shunts had almost disappeared in favour of fistulas, whereas by 1990 prevalent patients were divided between fistulas and catheters, with a smaller number of patients using grafts.

In America in particular, graft use was popular and supported by manufacturers, but their favourable short-term outcome was followed by an increased complication rate and the need for regular intervention. The original motivation behind the 'fistula first breakthrough initiative' was to reverse this trend and hence promote fistula access. An unintended consequence of diminished graft use was increased reliance on catheters, and as this became apparent towards the end of the 1990's, along with the first observational studies of access mortality associations, the mantra of 'fistula first, catheter last' was born.

This hierarchical concept of 'best access' (in which a fistula is better than a graft, which is better than catheter) became consolidated in literature, widely accepted, and incorporated into guidelines during the first decade of millennium, with financial incentives in a number of countries. The NHS adopted the concept in 2011 with the introduction of a best practice tariff for haemodialysis, which purchases dialysis sessions from institutions according to the access used, with catheter patients attracting 20% less income than those on a fistula or graft. In the most recent registry audit, just under 70% of prevalent haemodialysis patients were using a fistula or graft, with the latter contributing about 4%.

### Vascular access among patients initiating hemodialysis… [^3a6d474f]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

CVC use refers to patients with a CVC only and no AVF or AVG at the time of dialysis initiation. P <. 001 for trend in all access types except AVG. ESKD indicates end-stage kidney disease. CVC use refers to patients with a CVC only and no AVF or AVG at the time of dialysis initiation. Longer duration of predialysis nephrology care was associated with a higher likelihood of starting hemodialysis with an AVF and a lower likelihood of initiating hemodialysis with a CVC, but it was not associated with AVG use. However, regardless of duration of predialysis nephrology care, AVF use decreased and CVC use increased between 2015 and 2020. ESKD indicates end-stage kidney disease. © 2025 The 2006 clinical practice guidelines for vascular access recommend placing arteriovenous fistulas in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease prior to need for maintenance hemodialysis, to decrease central venous catheter dependence.

1.

Predialysis AVF placement decreased from 34% in 2015 to 25% in
2020. The proportion of patients with predialysis AVF placement who subsequently used their AVF at dialysis initiation increased from 51% in 2015 to 55% in 2020, indicating a higher AVF maturation rate. We hypothesize 3 explanations for the decrease in AVF use among patients initiating hemodialysis: less emphasis on predialysis vascular access management compared with its management among patients who have been undergoing dialysis, a greater focus on shared decision-making including whether to pursue dialysis 3 and whether. to pursue peritoneal dialysis 4 before referral for vascular access surgery, and more selective placement of AVFs in patients for whom an AVF is likely to succeed.

5 The decrease in AVF use may be the inadvertent outcome of the more nuanced, patient-centered 2019 vascular access guidelines, which emphasize selection of the access that is most suitable for each patient. 6 Our analysis is limited by use of administrative data.

KDOQI vascular access — pre-KRT patient being considered for hemodialysis (Figure 1.2): The algorithm begins with "What is the likelihood of long-term survival? (eg., > 1 year)". If survival is "Poor:… Watch, Wait and Re-assess Approach", and hemodialysis is needed ("HD needed [e.g., palliative HD?]"), options are "Consider AVG (patient preference)" or "Consider CVC (patient preference)". If survival is good, assess suitability and ask "Is this patient a good AVF candidate?" For a non-candidate, "Consider AVG", then evaluate "Is secondary AVF possible when AVG becomes problematic?" with "No" leading to "Continue with AVG" and "Yes" to "Consider AVF"; for a candidate, proceed to "Consider AVF".

### The risks of vascular access [^5c2b8b8f]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

Fatal vascular access hemorrhage is considered a rare complication of hemodialysis (HD). Ellingson et al. indicate otherwise, and their data suggest that it causes 0.4–1.6% of deaths in US HD patients. It is more common with grafts than fistulas, and many victims have had previous access hemorrhages. The widespread presumption that a fistula is the best, and a cuffed catheter the worst, access for HD patients needs reassessment, particularly in older, sicker patients.

### We send thrombosed AV accesses to the operating room [^3a25bfbc]. Seminars in Dialysis (2016). Low credibility.

A thrombosed dialysis access can be declotted either through an open surgical procedure or a percutaneous one. In choosing how the access should be managed, a nephrologist should balance the experience and outcomes of local providers to ensure the efficient and safe salvage of the vascular access. Percutaneous procedures often offer less disruption to the schedule of the patient and dialysis clinic, give more information about the central vasculature, are less invasive, and ultimately are preferred. Nephrologist should encourage local vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists to become proficient in these procedures to avoid unnecessary open cases.

### Radiological diagnosis of dialysis-associated complications [^c3e4c5e5]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Stenoses can be partially treated by appropriate puncture techniques. If a stenosis in the area of the fistula or the interponat is suspected, gaining dialysis access has absolute priority. The surgery should be done in such a way that at least a part of the access can be punctured immediately so the implantation of a temporary dialysis catheter can be avoided. Stenoses in the area of the arterial anastomosis, so-called type I stenoses, can be treated interventionally. In addition to percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), particularly for scarred stenoses, a "cutting balloon" technique can be applied to treat the stenosis and to improve the arterial inflow. Type II stenoses, which occur in the area of the fistula vein at the puncture site, should be treated interventionally. Thus, after PTA, the puncture area can be used again immediately for dialysis. Recurrent stenoses are an indication for surgical intervention by means of a (venous) patch or (prosthetic) interponate. Stenoses of the fistula veins at their confluence into the deep venous system, type III stenoses, occasionally appear in brachiocephalic fistulas and after basilica transposition. They can be treated using PTA but have a high risk of recurrence. Here, it is possible to perform a stent implantation in the same session to preserve the dialysis access (Fig. 24a, b, c).

Pediatric septic shock — vasoactive infusion initiation and vascular access: All vasoactive agents, including norepinephrine, may be initiated through peripheral venous or intraosseous access if central venous access is not readily available to avoid delays, and central venous access should be obtained as soon as reasonably practicable. In practice, 82% of panel members reported at least sometimes administering the initial vasoactive infusion peripherally when central venous or intraosseous access was not readily available, particularly in emergency department or other non-PICU settings. Most panelists preferred epinephrine or dopamine if a peripheral infusion was needed, and although epinephrine or norepinephrine is the preferred first-line medication, dopamine may be substituted as the first-line vasoactive infusion, administered either peripherally or centrally, if neither epinephrine nor norepinephrine is readily available.

### Risk factors associated with difficult venous access in adult ED patients [^d6f73c5d]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective was to determine risk factors associated with difficult venous access (DVA) in the emergency department (ED).

Methods

This was a prospective, observational study conducted in the ED of an urban tertiary care hospital. Adult patients undergoing intravenous (IV) placement were consecutively enrolled during periods of block enrollment. The primary outcome was DVA, defined as 3 or more IV attempts or use of a method of rescue vascular access to establish IV access. Univariate and multivariate analyses for factors predicting DVA were performed using logistic regression.

Results

A total of 743 patients were enrolled, of which 88 (11.8%) met the criteria for DVA. In the adjusted analysis, only 3 medical conditions were significantly associated with DVA: diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 1.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1–2.8), sickle cell disease (OR 3.8, 95% CI 1.5–9.5), and history of IV drug abuse (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.1–5.7). Notably, age, body mass index, and dialysis were not. Of patients who reported a history of requiring multiple IV attempts in the past for IV access, 14% met criteria for DVA on this visit (OR 7.7 95% CI 3–18). Of the patients who reported a history of IV insertion into the external jugular, ultrasound-guided IV placement, or a central venous catheter for IV access, 26% had DVA on this visit (OR 16.7, 95% CI 6.8–41).

Conclusions

Nearly 1 of every 9 to 10 adults in an urban ED had DVA. Diabetes, IV drug abuse, and sickle cell disease were found to be significantly associated with DVA.

### Emergency department use among adults receiving dialysis [^44dff9e8]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

The results of this cohort study show that important medical and sociodemographic factors, such as chronic pain and socioeconomic disadvantage, are associated with potentially preventable ED use among people receiving maintenance dialysis. While potentially preventable ED encounters reflected a small proportion of ED visits overall, our findings point to a need for holistic care approaches in this population that improve access to care for dialysis-related and other urgent health concerns and attend to patients' well-being and psychosocial concerns. Our study raises important questions about the aspects of health care use that are truly preventable and to what extent efforts to curb frequent ED use in this population should target the condition itself, its underlying contributors, or acute care processes.

### Interventional nephrology: when should you consider a graft? [^d85694c5]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

The patient's vascular access is critical in ensuring that hemodialysis is successful, effective, relatively uncomplicated, and consistently reproducible from one treatment to another. The choice of vascular access is dictated by a multitude of factors, some of which are generalizable to a larger system, and others of which are flavored by local experience and expertise; an important fraction is specific to the patient presenting to the clinician at a particular point in time. Some of these factors, such as patient age and sex, are not modifiable; others, like comorbidity, vessel size and urgency of presentation to the renal provider, are manageable and sometimes modifiable. The role of the autologous arteriovenous fistula as the ideal conduit for hemodialysis treatments is well established. The role of the prosthetic graft warrants discussion and investigation to most optimally apply to patients this important alternative within the armamentarium of vascular access.

The number of patients requiring dialysis is increasing, in particular those patients over the age of 75. The arteriovenous fistula is the preferred access for hemodialysis due to fewer complications and decreased mortality. Access complications are common and require early recognition and treatment. Postoperative access surveillance is important to ensure timely diagnosis and treatment of access-related complications. There is a continued need for high-quality data to assist in determining the best access for each patient.

### New biological solutions for hemodialysis access [^c29374a6]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2011). Low credibility.

Since Scribner described the first prosthetic chronic dialysis shunt in 1961, the surgical techniques and strategies to maintain vascular access have improved dramatically. Today, hundreds of thousands of patients worldwide are treated with some combination of native vein fistula, synthetic vascular graft, or synthetic semipermanent catheter. Despite significantly lower efficacy compared with autologous fistulae, the basic materials used for synthetic shunts and catheters have evolved surprisingly slowly. The disparity between efficacy rates and concomitant maintenance costs has driven a strong campaign to decrease the use of synthetic grafts and catheters in favor of native fistulae. Whether arguing the benefits of Fistula First or "Catheter Last", the fact that clinicians are in need of an alternative to expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) is irrefutable. The poor performance of synthetic materials has a significant economic impact as well. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) accounts for approximately 6% of Medicare's overall budget, despite a prevalence of about 0.17%. Of that, 15%-25% is spent on access maintenance, making hemodialysis access a critical priority for Medicare. This clinical and economic situation has spawned an aggressive effort to improve clinical care strategies to reduce overall cost and complications. While the bulk of this effort has historically focused on developing new synthetic biomaterials, more recently, investigators have developed a variety of cell-based strategies to create tissue-engineered vascular grafts. In this article, we review the evolution of the field of cardiovascular tissue engineering. We also present an update on the Lifeline™ vascular graft, an autologous, biological, and tissue-engineered vascular graft, which was the first tissue-engineered graft to be used clinically in dialysis patients.

### Treatment of life-threatening hyperkalemia with peritoneal dialysis in the ED [^e2fb678d]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Severe hyperkalemia (serum potassium N 7.0 mmol/L) is an uncommon electrolyte abnormality in patients undergoing maintenance peritoneal dialysis (PD). Hemodialysis (HD) has been suggested as the definitive therapy for severe hyperkalemia in this population, although there is limited data regarding renal replacement options. We report a case of life-threatening hyperkalemia with electrocardiogram changes in a nonadherent PD patient who was successfully treated with standard medical therapy and manual exchanges initiated by emergency department (ED) personnel. The patient did not require HD. This case demonstrates the potential utility of PD as a treatment option for severe hyperkalemia in established dialysis patients when EDs are prepared to deliver exchanges. This report maybe particularly relevant due to the increasing prevalence rate of PD and for centers with limited HD access.

### Vascular access in haemodialysis: strengthening the achilles' heel [^2707a509]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2013). Medium credibility.

Despite all the progress achieved since Scribner first introduced the arteriovenous (AV) shunt in 1960 and Cimino and Brescia introduced the native AV fistula in 1962, we have continued to face a conundrum in vascular access for dialysis, in that dialysis vascular access is at the same time both the 'lifeline' and the 'Achilles' heel' of haemodialysis. Indeed, findings from a multitude of published articles in this area, unfortunately mainly observational studies, reflect both our frustration and our limited knowledge in this area. Despite improved understanding of the pathophysiology of stenosis and thrombosis of the vascular access, we have unfortunately not been very successful in translating these advances into either improved therapies or a superior process of care. As a result, we continue to face an epidemic of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) maturation failure, a proliferation of relatively ineffective interventions such as angioplasty and stent placement, an extremely high incidence of catheter use, and more doubts rather than guidance with regard to the role (or lack thereof) of surveillance. An important reason for these problems is the lack of focused translational research and robust randomized prospective studies in this area. In this Review, we will address some of these critical issues, with a special emphasis on identifying the best process of care pathways that could reduce morbidity and mortality. We also discuss the potential use of novel therapies to reduce dialysis vascular access dysfunction.

### Guidelines for laparoscopic peritoneal dialysis access surgery [^a209d497]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Patient selection — Guideline recommendations for laparoscopic peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter insertion state that contraindications include active abdominal infection and uncorrectable mechanical defects of the abdominal wall, with a "Strong recommendation". History of prior abdominal surgery, regardless of how many, is not a contraindication to laparoscopic PD catheter insertion, and it is appropriate for surgeons with experience in advanced laparoscopy to attempt lysis of adhesions and catheter placement in these patients, with a "Strong recommendation". Patients with abdominal wall hernias should be diagnosed and repaired before or at the same time as PD catheter insertion, and a repair should be chosen that minimizes peritoneal dissection and does not place mesh intraperitoneally, with a "Weak recommendation". PD may be initiated in patients with intraabdominal foreign bodies such as after open abdominal aortic aneurysm graft repair, but a four month waiting period is recommended, and data are very limited regarding PD in the presence of an adjustable gastric band, with a "Weak recommendation". PD may be safely initiated in patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts, with a "Weak recommendation". Gastrostomy tubes can be used in pediatric patients on PD, though placement by blind percutaneous endoscopic technique (PEG) appears to be associated with higher infection rates compared to open insertion, with a "Weak recommendation". Laparoscopic PD catheter insertion with carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum requires general anesthesia; patients who are high risk to undergo general anesthesia should be considered for techniques using local anesthesia and sedation (such as open insertion or fluoroscopically guided percutaneous insertion), and laparoscopic insertion using nitrous oxide pneumoperitoneum and local anesthesia is also an option where available, with a "Weak recommendation".

### The management of dialysis access thrombosis during the COVID-19 pandemic [^192f55d7]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Maintaining patent access is essential for haemodialysis dependent end stage renal failure patients. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected surgical and interventional radiology services worldwide. We aimed to review the impact COVID-19 has caused to the management of acute dialysis access thrombosis.

Methods

We conducted a single centre retrospective review of outcomes of patients with arteriovenous fistula and arteriovenous graft thrombosis between March and May 2020, which coincided with the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in London, and a similar period in the previous year, March-May 2019. Outcomes in both cohorts of patients were compared, including attempts at salvage, salvage success, 1-month patency rates after salvage and subsequent surgery on the same access. We also analysed the use of tunnelled haemodialysis lines (THL), either due to failed salvage attempts or when salvage was not attempted.

Results

There was a similar incidence of access thrombosis in both periods (26 cases in 2019, 38 in 2020). There were 601 patients dialysing via an arteriovenous fistula or graft in 2019, and 568 patients in 2020. Access salvage, when attempted, had similar success rates and 1-month patency (salvage success 74% vs 80%, p = 0.39; 1-month patency 55% vs 62%, p = 0.69). The proportion of patients where access salvage was not attempted and a THL inserted was significantly higher in 2020 compared to 2019 (32% vs 4%, p = 0.007). There were more patients who subsequently had surgery to salvage or revise the same access in 2019 compared to 2020 (62% vs 13%, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, there were fewer attempts at access salvage. This was a conscious decision due to increased pressure on the healthcare system, access to emergency interventional radiology or operative theatres and the perceived risk/benefit ratio of access salvage. The long-term effects of this change in practice remain unknown.

### Risk assessment of failure during transitioning from in-centre to home haemodialysis [^7805511b]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Failure modes and risk priority numbers

After reviewing various main areas, transitioning to HHD was found to have the highest risk of failure (Fig. 1). The FMEA on the transitioning to HHD process was independently completed by the two teams, but the final score was determined after joint deliberation. The three main processes in transitioning to HHD area are setting up the HHD system at home, completing tests before starting HHD, and performing HHD.

There was a total of 5 main steps with 13 failure modes in setting up the HHD system at home and 2 main steps with 2 failure modes in completion of the tests before starting HHD. We identified that performing HHD treatment has a total of 7 sub-processes; including (1) preparation to start HHD treatment, (2) general patient and dialysis equipment evaluation before starting dialysis, (3) managing vascular access during dialysis treatment, (4) dealing with treatment interruption and troubleshooting machine alarms, (5) administering medication during dialysis, (6) others, and (7) ending dialysis, with a total of 27 steps and 44 failure modes (Table 2). Among the sub-processes, managing vascular access during treatment has the highest failure modes (Additional file 1: Appendix 1).

Vascular access management had a total 9 steps with 9 failure modes. Failure mode effect analysis revealed scores ranging from 9 to 256 with a mean of 135 and median of 144 respectively. The highest RPNs were failure to monitor vascular access, a defective technique in cannulation access, and troubleshooting vascular access alarm with scores of 252, 256, and 180 respectively. As vascular access management and troubleshooting access alarms are overlapping and have higher RPN scores, we explored the failure modes, effect, consequences, and identified risk mitigation strategies in all 9 areas of access-related medical emergencies. In particular we emphasized 3 main areas with high RPN scores, highlighted in grey in Table 3.

During a 3-year period (2012–2014), 26 patients (14 women, 12 men) on chronic hemodialysis were treated for access conduit bleeding (n = 18) or life-threatening hemorrhage (n = 8), located in the upper extremity (n = 23) or thigh (n = 3). All patients had developed bleeding from a skin eschar/ulcer over a bovine (n = 9) or polytetrafluoroethylene (n = 9) bridge graft, or aneurysmal autogenous fistula (n = 8). A retrospective review of outcome relative to clinical signs, etiology of conduit bleeding (infection, wall erosion), and the type of rescue procedure(s) was performed. Duplex ultrasound testing was used to guide therapy based on the presence of aneurysmal degeneration, perigraft fluid, or access flow pattern indicative of venous outflow obstruction.

Results

One-half of the patients were taken emergently to the operating room for hemorrhage control or impending rupture of an infected false aneurysm, the remaining repaired on an urgent basis. In 18 patients, emergency room personnel attempted control of access site bleeding by suturing (n = 14) or tourniquet (n = 4). Dialysis access salvage was achieved in 22 (85%) of 26 patients by in situ conduit replacement using a rifampin-soaked polytetrafluoroethylene conduit (n = 19) or primary repair (n = 3). Two patients with sepsis and ruptured, infected false aneurysm were treated by ligation, and 2 patients with nonsalvable access had conversion to an autogenous fistula. One-third of rescued accesses (n = 7) had staged endovascular treatment of central vein stenosis. One patient died within 30 days. All dialysis access revisions remained patent and used for immediate dialysis (n = 5), within 4–5 weeks (n = 19), or after vein maturation (n = 2). One replaced graft was revised for infection. Positive blood or bleeding site cultures were obtained from 9 (45%) of 20 patients tested.

Conclusions

Salvage of a functional dialysis access is possible in the majority of patients presenting with conduit hemorrhage. Loss of wall integrity, infection, and venous hypertension were etiologic factors. Application of in situ graft replacement strategies known to be effective in the treatment of graft infection should be considered in the management of this surgical emergency.

Compared to fistulas, grafts are less favourable in terms of complications, patient experience, and durability in particular. One year primary and secondary graft patency varies between 40–50% and 70–90% respectively in a range of studies. In a review of over 200 studies, 2-year primary and secondary patency rates for fistulas were 55% (95%CI 52–58%) and 63% (95%CI 59–67%). Graft outcomes were inferior with primary patency 40% (95%CI 35–44%) and secondary (procedurally supported) patency 60% (95%CI 55–65%) highlighting the increased treatment burden. Infection rates over the 2 year period were also higher at 13% with grafts (95%CI 10–17%) verses only 2% with fistulas (95%CI 1–4%). However, the superiority of fistulas over grafts is only relevant in those patients who have adequate vessels for fistulas formation. In the absence of suitable vessels, graft placement maybe preferable to a high risk fistula which is likely to fail despite multiple interventions.

In addition to simpler anatomic requirements, primary failure is uncommon, and grafts do not need to mature. A short period of incorporation into the tissues is needed, but grafts can usually be needled from around 2 to 4 weeks - this early reliability allows a delayed access decision, close to the time of starting dialysis. Multilaminar grafts which incorporate into the tissue more quickly have also been developed, allowing earlier needling, usually within 24 hours of placement. These 'early cannulation' grafts can be used as emergency access for unplanned kidney failure or for fistula salvage, and they may also be useful when delayed maturation is anticipated and a bridging catheter might otherwise be required: in a meta-analysis of 19 studies 66% of fistula formations (95%CI 57–75%) were accompanied by a bridging catheter. Outcomes with early cannulation grafts are similar to other graft types, with 1-year secondary patency ranging from 41% (N = 37) to 84% (N = 141), with no apparent increase in infection rates (6% over one year).

Although the evidence quality is low, one can draw some conclusions from these data to assist in decision making with patients. Bacteraemia, in the absence of severe sepsis (requiring pressors or persisting beyond 48 hours of treatment), may be managed with antibiotics (delivered systemically and via catheter lock) with or without catheter replacement (by either exchange or removal with interval replacement), with replacement being less convenient but more often curative. External catheter appearance, microbiology, and of course patient priorities may contribute to this decision, with replacement usually favoured for StA infections (and by some clinicians for Pseudomonas also). All patients, but particularly those not replacing their catheter, should be aware of the risk of deterioration or recurrence, for which a catheter non-replacement strategy should not be attempted repeatedly. Metastatic infections are not rare complications, particularly with StA infections, and both treatment duration and monitoring are modified, therefore echocardiography should usually be performed, and other metastatic infections may also be sought depending on clinical suspicion.

### Guideline recommendations on minimal blood vessel diameters and arteriovenous fistula outcomes [^593b1622]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Non-maturation of newly created arteriovenous fistulas is an important clinical problem leading to additional interventions and prolonged central venous catheter dependence in patients starting hemodialysis treatment. Therefore, the preoperative assessment of these patients is focused on finding a combination of good quality arteries and veins that has a high likelihood of developing into a functional vascular access. Historically, the diameter of these blood vessels has been regarded as one of the primary indicators of the suitability for a native arteriovenous fistula. Ultrasound allows precise measurement of blood vessel diameters before fistula creation and this has been shown to improve vascular access outcomes as compared to preoperative physical examination alone. However, the minimal blood vessel diameters that are considered acceptable for creation of these fistulas vary between dialysis units. Even international clinical practice guidelines on vascular access provide different recommendations: the European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) advises minimal arterial and venous diameters of 2 mm in the forearm and 3 mm in the upper arm, whereas the KDOQI 2019 Update provides a weak recommendation to use blood vessels smaller than 2 mm only after critical assessment of their quality.

Just before the ESVS Clinical Practice Guidelines on vascular access were published, we performed the prospective multicenter Shunt Simulation Study, resulting in a representative cohort of patients with end-stage renal disease receiving their first arteriovenous fistula with detailed information on preoperative blood vessel characteristics and vascular access function. We noticed that many patients received arteriovenous fistulas using arteries and veins smaller than recommended by the ESVS Clinical Practice Guidelines published in June 2018. Since all patients enrolled in the study were operated on before this time, there could be no bias resulting from deliberate deviation from published guidelines by our vascular surgeons. The Shunt Simulation Study cohort therefore provides an excellent opportunity to investigate the validity of these recommendations by analyzing its arteriovenous fistula outcomes according to concordance with the guidelines.

### Social determinants of health associated with hemodialysis non-adherence and emergency department utilization: a pilot observational study [^5f5ae9d6]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite growing ED utilization by dialysis patients and its attendant cost and morbidity, prospective studies to identify risk factors for ED utilization by dialysis patients who have missed dialysis treatments remain limited. Patients on scheduled maintenance dialysis miss treatments and present to the ED despite established weekly points of contact with the outpatient healthcare system. Access to ambulatory care does not fully explain the risk of ED visits in ambulatory care sensitive conditions; elements such as income, ethnicity, cultural background, and trust with the healthcare system impact ED utilization. Similarly, community-level determinants may play a role in dialysis non-adherence and ED utilization. The World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and the Healthy People 2020 and 2030 initiatives have all placed an increased focus upon social determinants of health (SDOH), i.e. the conditions in the places where people live, learn, work, and play. SDOH impact patients' behavioral choices and are associated with clinical outcomes in ESRD patients. Unmet SDOH in the ESRD patient may predict non-adherence to dialysis treatment and the incidence of preventable ED visits or hospitalizations. However, SDOH have not received sufficient attention in ESRD patients, and there is very limited prospective data on SDOH and their impact on dialysis non-adherence and ED utilization. The urban ED, which serves as a "window into the community" and a social safety net, is poised to address the aforementioned research gaps. Therefore, this pilot study seeks to identify the specific medical factors and SDOH associated with missing hemodialysis (HD) and subsequent ED utilization, and to describe the resultant resource use upon presenting to the ED.

### A case of brachiocephalic fistula steal and the emergency physician's approach to hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula complications [^32bb4505]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease is common in the United States, with many patients maintained on hemodialysis (HD). The process of HD requires vascular access through an arteriovenous (AV) fistula, AV graft, or central venous catheter. Today, as a result of the National Kidney Foundation's "Fistula First" initiative, nearly 55% of HD patients utilize an AV fistula. As there is significant morbidity and mortality associated with fistula placement and recurrent fistula cannulation, emergency physicians must be equipped to recognize and treat fistula complications.

Objective

To detail a case study of vascular insufficiency (vascular steal) presenting to an emergency department (ED) and provide an evidence-based approach to the emergency assessment and management of HD AV fistula complications.

Discussion

A 66-year-old man presented to the ED with left upper extremity pain, paresthesias, and loss of grip strength of 1-week duration 15 days after placement of left upper extremity brachiocephalic fistula. He was diagnosed with dialysis access-associated steal syndrome and taken to the operating room for revision. Patients with HD fistulas may experience several complications, including vascular insufficiency, hemorrhage, infection, stenosis, thrombosis, aneurysms, or pseudoaneurysms. Emergency physicians must be able to identify these complications and deliver timely treatment.

Conclusions

A comprehensive understanding of the appropriate management of AV fistula complications is paramount for the emergency physician. Early recognition and treatment of vascular insufficiency resulting from fistula creation, fistula hemorrhage, fistula infection, stenosis, thrombosis, and aneurysms or pseudoaneurysms is vital to reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with HD.

The vascular lab (VL) provides vital information for dialysis access to guide management. This article discusses the indication, protocol, and diagnostic criteria for the evaluation of arteriovenous fistulas and grafts. An arteriovenous (AV) dialysis access is made by creating a connection between an artery and vein (AV fistula [AVF]) or by interposing a conduit between an artery and a vein (AV graft [AVG]) to provide high flow circuit for hemodialysis. A normal mature AV dialysis access has a thrill or vibration from turbulent flow in the graft or vein. The nomenclatures at our institution for an AVF and AVG are in the Figure 1 A and B diagrams.

### Catheter access for hemodialysis: an overview [^46866dd2]. Seminars in Dialysis (2002). Low credibility.

The provision of hemodialysis requires repeated, reliable access to the central circulatory system. Long-term hemodialysis has best been provided by arteriovenous fistulae and arteriovenous grafts. In recent years, more and more patients have been chronically dialyzed with tunneled dialysis catheters. These catheters, which were originally developed as a short-term bridge to permanent vascular access, have made up an increasing percentage of maintenance vascular access. While these catheters have the advantage of ease of placement and are immediately ready for use, they substantially increase the risk of bacteremia, stenosis of central veins, and even mortality.

### Creation of a transrenal arteriovenous dialysis shunt: feasibility study in a swine model [^da291e27]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the feasibility of percutaneous renal artery and vein access for the creation of a transrenal arteriovenous hemodialysis graft.

Materials and Methods

Renal-artery-to-ipsilateral-renal-vein conduits were constructed with use of entirely percutaneous techniques in seven swine. Renal artery and vein access was performed in six animals with use of a retrograde (inside-out) technique and in one animal with use of an antegrade (outside-in) technique. Modified 8-F sheaths were used in the first three animals and Wallgrafts were used in the final four animals to form the arterial and venous limbs of each shunt. The arterial and venous limbs were joined together by a subcutaneous segment of 6-mm reinforced polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) in five animals and by external conduits in two animals. Wallgrafts were deployed from the renal artery and vein into the segments of PTFE. The free ends of each conduit were tunneled and joined together to close the arteriovenous circuit. Post-shunt angiography was used in all animals to document successful shunt creation and demonstrate rapid arteriovenous shunting as a determinant of technical feasibility. Two of the seven animals received additional anticoagulation therapy and/or antiplatelet therapy to prevent shunt thrombosis during the follow-up period. The three initial animals were killed within 2 hours of shunt creation, and two of the remaining four animals returned for angiographic follow-up, one on day 2 and one on day 9. All animals underwent a complete necropsy to assess for potential complications including hemorrhage and vascular or bowel injury.

Results

Retrograde renal arterial and venous access was successful in all six animals in which it was attempted. Five of six arterial accesses and four of six venous accesses traversed the peritoneum with two arterial accesses and one venous access penetrating a loop of large bowel. Antegrade access was performed and successfully accomplished in the final animal. Brisk arteriovenous shunting was demonstrated on completion angiography in all animals. Graft occlusion was present in the two animals that returned for follow-up and two animals died before follow-up as a result of graft leakage and subsequent hemorrhage. Minimal perinephric and intrarenal hemorrhage was demonstrated at necropsy after shunt insertion in the remaining five animals. Renal infarction was present in all kidneys used for transrenal access.

Conclusion

The transrenal approach for the creation of a percutaneous arteriovenous shunt is feasible after renal artery and vein access by either the retrograde or antegrade technique. Additional technical refinements of the procedure and the devices used will be necessary before follow-up studies are conducted.

KDOQI Guideline 17. AV access aneurysms — Recognition, diagnosis, and management emphasize surveillance, imaging, and surgical preference. KDOQI considers it reasonable to check arteriovenous (AV) access for aneurysm/pseudoaneurysm at each dialysis session by knowledgeable care providers and to proactively educate patients on emergency procedures for aneurysm rupture, seeking proactive surgical assessment when clinical findings suggest risk; emergent surgical assessment and treatment are considered reasonable for complications such as erosion or hemorrhage. Duplex ultrasound is considered reasonable to corroborate physical examination and to obtain information on size, stenosis/thrombus, and impact on access including flow rate and inflow/outflow status. Presence of an asymptomatic aneurysm/pseudoaneurysm alone is considered not an indication for definitive treatment. Cannulation of the involved segment should be avoided when alternative sites exist; if none, KDOQI considers it reasonable that the sides (base) of the lesion be cannulated, avoiding the top. Imaging of arterial inflow and venous outflow is considered reasonable prior to or during definitive treatment of symptomatic lesions. Surgical management is considered the preferred treatment for symptomatic, large, or rapidly expanding lesions, and KDOQI considers it reasonable that open surgical treatment should be deemed the definitive treatment with approach based on local expertise; staged repair to avoid bridging central venous catheters may be included. Covered intraluminal stents (stent grafts) are considered reasonable only in special circumstances due to infection risk, and if used, cannulation over the stent segment should be avoided when possible; use of stent grafts for aneurysm/pseudoaneurysm management is noted as not an FDA‑approved indication. Appropriate cannulation techniques are considered reasonable to reduce occurrence of AV access aneurysms/pseudoaneurysms.

### Guidelines for laparoscopic peritoneal dialysis access surgery [^190e6002]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for laparoscopic peritoneal dialysis (PD) access surgery — patient selection emphasizes that contraindications for laparoscopic PD catheter placement include active abdominal infection and uncorrectable mechanical defects of the abdominal wall (+++ Evidence, Strong recommendation). History of prior abdominal surgery, regardless of how many, is not a contraindication to laparoscopic PD catheter insertion, and it is appropriate for surgeons with experience in advanced laparoscopy to attempt lysis of adhesions and catheter placement in these patients (++ Evidence, Strong recommendation). Patients with abdominal wall hernias should be diagnosed and repaired before or at the same time as PD catheter insertion, and a repair should be chosen that minimizes peritoneal dissection and does not place mesh intraperitoneally (++ Evidence, Weak recommendation). Peritoneal dialysis may be initiated in patients with intraabdominal foreign bodies such as after open abdominal aortic aneurysm graft repair, but a four month waiting period is recommended, and very limited data exists regarding peritoneal dialysis in the presence of an adjustable gastric band (++ Evidence, Weak recommendation). Peritoneal dialysis may be safely initiated in patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts (++ Evidence, Weak recommendation). Gastrostomy tubes can be used in pediatric patients on peritoneal dialysis, though placement by blind percutaneous endoscopic technique (PEG) appears to be associated with higher infection rates compared to open insertion (++ Evidence, Weak recommendation). Laparoscopic PD catheter insertion with carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum requires general anesthesia; patients who are high risk to undergo general anesthesia should be considered for a technique that only requires local anesthesia and sedation, such as open insertion or fluoroscopically guided percutaneous insertion, and laparoscopic insertion using nitrous oxide pneumoperitoneum and local anesthesia is also an option where available (++ Evidence, Weak recommendation).

### Evaluating the emergency management of arteriovenous fistula and graft bleeds [^eedb6499]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Arteriovenous (AV) access bleeding requires prompt management, but little is known about short- and long-term outcomes after these event. Our goal was to evaluate emergency management of AV access bleeds and their outcomes METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of emergency department (ED) visits for AV access bleeding at a tertiary care center between 2014–2022. Presentation, severity, management, and outcomes were evaluated.

Results

There were 66 patients that met inclusion criteria (mean age was 65.4 years, 51.5% were male, 66.7% were Black, and 18.2% were Hispanic). Access types included brachiocephalic (34.8%), brachiobasilic (28.8%), radiocephalic (9.1%) fistulas, upper extremity AV grafts (16.7%), and lower extremity access (16.7%). The majority (78.8%) were post-cannulation bleeds with 18.2% being primary ulcers. Triage emergency severity index classified ED presentation as life-threatening (6.1%), high-risk (31.8%), urgent (60.6%), and semi-urgent (1.5%). ED interventions included manual pressure (37.9%), suture placement (25.8%), topical hemostatic agents (15.2%), a clamp device (13.6%), and tourniquet placement (1.5%). Vascular surgery was consulted in approximately half (48.5%) of cases. 59% patients were discharged from the ED and 41% were admitted to the hospital for further management. Tunneled dialysis catheters were placed in 15.2% of all hospitalized patients. 45.5% of patients required an intervention on their access (45.5% open and 54.6% endovascular). 60% and 40% of open operations were access revisions and ligations, respectively. The majority (83.3%) of patients undergoing fistulograms required an intervention. At 90-days, 59% re-presented to the ED, with 23% of all readmissions being for related causes. At 1-year, 22.7% of patients required new AV access creation. Six-month follow-up with an access surgeon was low at only 45.5%. Having an access surgeon evaluate patients in the ED resulted in fewer related-readmissions (25% vs 2.9%, P = 0.02), and 1-year interventions (43.8% vs 17.7%, P = 0.02), but there was no difference in the need for new AV access creations (12.5% vs 2.9%, P = 0.19), and the 6-month follow up in both groups was low (34.4% vs 55.9%, P = 0.08).

Conclusion

Over one-third of AV access bleeds presenting to the ED were of life-threatening or high-risk severity. Many such patients required a new AV access within one year. Improved interdepartmental communication and close patient follow-up remain opportunities for improved outcomes.

OVERDOSAGE

Acute emergencies from local anesthetics are generally related to high plasma levels encountered during therapeutic use of local anesthetics or to unintended subarachnoid injection of local anesthetic solution (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS).

Management of Local Anesthetic Emergencies

The first consideration is prevention, best accomplished by careful and constant monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory vital signs and the patient's state of consciousness after each local anesthetic injection. At the first sign of change, oxygen should be administered.

The first step in the management of convulsions, as well as underventilation or apnea due to unintended subarachnoid injection of drug solution, consists of immediate attention to the maintenance of a patent airway and assisted or controlled ventilation with oxygen and a delivery system capable of permitting immediate positive airway pressure by mask. Immediately after the institution of these ventilatory measures, the adequacy of the circulation should be evaluated, keeping in mind that drugs used to treat convulsions sometimes depress the circulation when administered intravenously. Should convulsions persist despite adequate respiratory support, and if the status of the circulation permits, small increments of an ultra-short acting barbiturate (such as thiopental or thiamylal) or a benzodiazepine (such as diazepam) may be administered intravenously. The clinician should be familiar, prior to the use of local anesthetics, with these anticonvulsant drugs. Supportive treatment of circulatory depression may require administration of intravenous fluids and, when appropriate, a vasopressor as directed by the clinical situation (e.g., ephedrine).

If not treated immediately, both convulsions and cardiovascular depression can result in hypoxia, acidosis, bradycardia, arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. Underventilation or apnea due to unintentional subarachnoid injection of local anesthetic solution may produce these same signs and also lead to cardiac arrest if ventilatory support is not instituted. If cardiac arrest should occur, standard cardiopulmonary resuscitative measures should be instituted.

Endotracheal intubation, employing drugs and techniques familiar to the clinician, may be indicated, after initial administration of oxygen by mask, if difficulty is encountered in the maintenance of a patent airway or if prolonged ventilatory support (assisted or controlled) is indicated.

Dialysis is of negligible value in the treatment of acute overdosage with lidocaine hydrochloride.

The oral LD50of lidocaine hydrochloride in non-fasted female rats is 459 (346 to 773) mg/kg (as the salt) and 214 (159 to 324) mg/kg (as the salt) in fasted female rats.

Functional cumulative patency is the duration from a mature fistula or graft to AV access abandonment defined from the first date the AV access can provide prescribed dialysis consistently with 2 needles for more than two thirds of dialysis sessions within 4 consecutive weeks to the date of AV access abandonment. Functional primary patency is the duration from a mature fistula or graft to thrombosis or any intervention to facilitate, maintain, or re-establish patency (eg, angioplasty), defined from the first date the AV access can provide prescribed dialysis consistently with 2 needles for more than two thirds of the dialysis sessions within 4 consecutive weeks to the date of the first such event.

### Insurance status and emergency department visits associated with hemodialysis in Texas [^53c51b6c]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) require regular hemodialysis (HD) treatment, which is nearly universally covered by Medicare in the United States. However, Medicare coverage is not available for individuals who are not US citizens or permanent residents. For many uninsured individuals with ESRD, intermittent dialysis through the emergency department (ED) is the sole treatment option. The system of accessing HD in the ED presents several major system-level challenges, including adding patient volume to overcrowded EDs, taxing hospital dialysis resources, and incurring substantial health care costs. Prior studies, characterizing the health burden of ED visits for HD treatment by patients with ESRD were limited to a single region. We sought to characterize ED visits for HD by insured and uninsured patients in Texas.

### A patient centered decision making dialysis access algorithm [^af915b03]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2007). Low credibility.

Much controversy surrounds the establishment of proper planning, placement and management (the best practice pattern) of dialysis access. These include the dialysis type and modality selection, timing of access placement and who places the access. The lack of and the difficulty of performing randomized studies with multiple confounding factors, in an extremely heterogeneous and rapidly changing ESRD population demographics, only partly explains the dialysis access conundrum. Add to this the rapidly developing and competing technologies, the wide spectrum of the professional experience, bias and socio-economic forces to make the ESRD problems as multivariate and complex as life itself. This overview describes a dialysis access algorithm approach to the patient needing renal replacement therapy, considering long-term improved patient outcome as the ultimate objective.
