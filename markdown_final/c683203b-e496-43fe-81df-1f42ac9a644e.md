## Question

What is the cost of an at this ulcer in the buccal ￼mucosa after unprotected sex?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the cost of an ulcer in the buccal mucosa after unprotected sex. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "cost" means — does it refer to financial cost, morbidity, or transmission risk. Then, I should verify the most likely infectious etiologies of a new buccal ulcer after sexual exposure and their diagnostic and treatment pathways. Next, I will estimate financial costs for evaluation and therapy, consider morbidity and complications, and finally assess transmission and public health implications, including HIV risk and partner management [^112LytF8] [^112XFLft].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and terminology. A buccal mucosa ulcer is a break in the lining of the inner cheek; after unprotected sex, infectious etiologies such as HSV, primary syphilis, and less commonly chancroid or LGV should be prioritized, while noninfectious causes like aphthae remain in the differential if STI testing is negative or risk is low [^112LytF8] [^111iPghf].

> I need to check the most likely infectious causes and their oral manifestations. HSV-1 or HSV-2 can present with painful grouped vesicles that ulcerate and may recur; PCR from the lesion is preferred for diagnosis because clinical exam alone is unreliable, and untreated episodes typically last 5–10 days with multiple recurrences per year in many patients [^111KDthH] [^1162YyeP]. Primary syphilis classically causes a painless, indurated chancre at the inoculation site, including the mouth, with serology guiding diagnosis; however, early serology can be negative, so treponemal PCR from lesion material can expedite diagnosis in the right context [^112XFLft] [^115ZGtwd]. Chancroid is uncommon in the U.S. but causes painful ulcers with suppurative nodes; diagnosis is challenging due to limited culture availability, and syndromic diagnosis relies on clinical criteria when tests are unavailable [^114wH37N] [^115XWdwN].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should verify the diagnostic approach and its cost implications. A standard STI evaluation for a new oral ulcer after sexual exposure should include syphilis serology with treponemal and nontreponemal tests, HSV PCR from the lesion, and HIV testing, with consideration of extragenital NAATs for gonorrhea and chlamydia based on exposure history; biopsy is reserved for atypical, nonhealing, or treatment-refractory lesions [^117XjXaP] [^112LytF8]. In many U.S. clinics, uninsured cash costs for these tests can approximate $150–$300 for serologies and PCR, with biopsy adding roughly $200–$500 if indicated; costs vary widely by setting and payer, and public health clinics often provide reduced or no-cost testing [^notfound].

> Next, I should review treatment costs and options. For HSV, episodic oral acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir for 5–10 days is effective; typical retail cash costs for a short course are about $20–$60 depending on the agent and dose, with generics on the lower end; suppressive therapy increases annual cost but reduces recurrences and transmission risk in selected patients [^112irAfY]. For primary syphilis, benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM once is first-line and inexpensive, often under $50 at many clinics; doxycycline is an alternative for penicillin-allergic patients, though penicillin is preferred when feasible [^112XFLft] [^113eLpPb]. For chancroid, single-dose azithromycin 1 g or ceftriaxone 250 mg IM are recommended regimens, generally low cost and practical [^114wH37N].

> I will now examine the morbidity "cost" beyond dollars. HSV causes painful ulcers, can impair eating and speaking, and carries psychosocial burden; recurrences are common, and in immunocompromised hosts lesions may be severe, persistent, or atypical, requiring IV therapy and longer courses [^111KDthH] [^112irAfY]. Syphilis, if untreated, progresses through secondary manifestations and can cause neurologic, ocular, and cardiovascular complications; early recognition and treatment prevent these sequelae and reduce transmission [^112XFLft] [^111dxTSU]. Nonhealing or atypical ulcers warrant biopsy to exclude malignancy or other systemic diseases, which adds procedural risk and cost but is essential for safety [^111CSgkm].

> But wait, what about transmission and public health costs. Active oral or genital ulcers increase HIV acquisition risk by disrupting mucosal barriers; treating ulcerative STIs may reduce HIV risk, though high-quality evidence is limited and guidelines still emphasize comprehensive STI/HIV screening and prevention services for those with ulcers [^116GAR9H] [^112LytF8]. Partner notification and treatment are critical to interrupt transmission chains; for syphilis, this is legally mandated in many jurisdictions, and for HSV, counseling on asymptomatic shedding and safer sex practices reduces spread even though HSV is not curable [^113NsJez] [^115GtDpx].

> Let me consider special scenarios that could raise costs or complexity. Immunocompromised patients may require IV acyclovir for severe HSV, longer treatment durations, and closer follow-up; diagnostic delays in early syphilis can necessitate additional serologic testing and partner tracing; and co-infections are not rare, requiring broader initial testing and sequential therapies, all of which increase total care costs [^113vor6Z] [^112XFLft] [^112LytF8]. If mpox is suspected based on exposure and lesion morphology, additional testing and isolation precautions may be needed, further impacting cost and care logistics [^114upBcE].

> I should double-check that I've addressed the user's question directly. The "cost" of a buccal ulcer after unprotected sex is best framed as a composite of financial, morbidity, and transmission costs: financial costs commonly total roughly $200–$800 for evaluation and first-line treatment in uninsured settings, with wide variability; morbidity costs include pain, functional impairment, recurrence, and risk of complications if untreated; and transmission costs include ongoing STI spread and increased HIV risk, which carry both personal and public health consequences [^117XjXaP] [^112irAfY] [^112XFLft] [^116GAR9H].

> Finally, I need to ensure the management advice is actionable. Prompt STI evaluation with appropriate testing, timely treatment, and partner services minimize total cost by shortening illness duration, preventing complications, and reducing transmission; in resource-limited settings, prioritize syphilis serology, HSV PCR, and HIV testing, and treat empirically when suspicion is high and follow-up is assured, aligning with CDC STI guidance and HIV prevention principles [^112LytF8] [^113NsJez].

---

A buccal mucosa ulcer after unprotected sex most often reflects **HSV or syphilis** [^112LytF8] [^112XFLft], with gonorrhea, chlamydia, chancroid, and mpox as differentials [^115XWdwN] [^114upBcE]. Diagnosis requires **targeted testing** (HSV PCR, syphilis serology, NAATs for gonorrhea/chlamydia, and mpox PCR if suspected) [^117XjXaP] [^115ZGtwd] [^114upBcE] and HIV screening [^117XjXaP]. Management is **etiology-specific**: acyclovir for HSV [^112irAfY], benzathine penicillin G for syphilis [^113eLpPb], and antibiotics for bacterial infections [^114wH37N]; mpox is supportive [^notfound]. Prompt treatment prevents complications and transmission, and **partner notification is essential** [^113BcK7s].

## Infectious etiologies of buccal mucosa ulcers

Several **sexually transmitted infections (STIs)** can cause buccal mucosa ulcers, including:

| **Pathogen** | **Clinical presentation** | **Diagnosis** | **Treatment** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Herpes simplex virus (HSV-1, HSV-2) | - Painful vesicles <br/> - Ulcers <br/> - Systemic symptoms | PCR for HSV-1/2 [^1162YyeP] | Acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir [^112irAfY] |
| Treponema pallidum (syphilis) | - Painless indurated ulcer (chancre) <br/> - Regional lymphadenopathy | - Syphilis serology [^112XFLft] <br/> - Darkfield microscopy [^117XjXaP] | Benzathine penicillin G [^112XFLft] |
| Neisseria gonorrhoeae | - Ulceration <br/> - Pharyngitis <br/> - Tonsillitis | NAAT for gonorrhea [^115jk9fP] | Ceftriaxone [^notfound] |
| Chlamydia trachomatis (LGV) | - Ulceration <br/> - Lymphadenopathy | NAAT for chlamydia [^117XjXaP] | Doxycycline [^112Apn7G] |
| Haemophilus ducreyi (chancroid) | - Painful ulcer <br/> - Suppurative lymphadenopathy | - Culture <br/> - NAAT [^114wH37N] | Azithromycin or ceftriaxone [^114wH37N] |
| Monkeypox virus | - Multiple ulcers <br/> - Systemic symptoms | PCR for monkeypox [^notfound] | Supportive care [^notfound] |

---

## Diagnostic approach

A thorough diagnostic approach includes:

- **Detailed sexual history**: Recent unprotected oral sex, partner symptoms, and travel history [^112Zciiu].

- **Physical examination**: Characterize the ulcer (painful vs. painless, indurated, multiple vs. solitary) and assess for lymphadenopathy [^111dxTSU].

- **Laboratory testing**: HSV PCR, syphilis serology (treponemal and nontreponemal tests) [^112XFLft], NAATs for gonorrhea and chlamydia [^1141qp9v], and monkeypox PCR if suspected [^114upBcE].

- **HIV screening**: Recommended for all patients with STI-related ulcers [^117XjXaP].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **identified pathogen**:

- **HSV**: Acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir for 7–10 days [^112irAfY]; suppressive therapy for frequent recurrences.

- **Syphilis**: Benzathine penicillin G intramuscularly; doxycycline for penicillin-allergic patients [^113eLpPb].

- **Gonorrhea**: Ceftriaxone intramuscularly [^notfound].

- **Chlamydia (LGV)**: Doxycycline for 21 days [^112Apn7G].

- **Chancroid**: Azithromycin or ceftriaxone [^114wH37N].

- **Monkeypox**: Supportive care, pain management, and infection control measures [^114upBcE].

---

## Potential complications

Untreated buccal mucosa ulcers from STIs can lead to **significant complications**, including:

- **Increased HIV risk**: Ulcers facilitate HIV transmission [^112LytF8].

- **Systemic infection**: Dissemination of pathogens (e.g. syphilis, HSV) [^112XFLft].

- **Chronic infection**: Persistent or recurrent ulcers [^111KDthH].

- **Transmission**: Ongoing spread to sexual partners [^114wH37N].

---

## Prevention and patient education

Prevention focuses on **consistent condom use** during oral, vaginal, and anal sex; reducing the number of partners; and undergoing regular STI screening. Patients should be educated to recognize symptoms early and seek prompt care, and to notify partners to prevent further transmission [^113NsJez].

---

A buccal mucosa ulcer after unprotected sex is most often due to HSV or syphilis, with other STIs as differentials. Accurate diagnosis and **pathogen-specific treatment** are essential to prevent complications and transmission, and prevention relies on safe sex practices and regular screening.

Nonodontogenic bacterial infections of the oral cavity are not a common finding in the United States. Nevertheless, there has been an increase in prevalence of certain bacterial sexually transmitted diseases, such as syphilis and gonorrhea, and conditions such as tuberculosis still pose a serious threat to certain segments of the population. Finally, given the uncommon nature and pathophysiology of these diseases, diagnosis is often delayed, resulting in more clinically significant disease and potential contamination of individuals. Thus, it is prudent that clinicians be familiar with these uncommon but potentially serious infectious diseases, so treatment can be instituted promptly.

The myriad presentations of ulcerative sexually transmitted infections, other than genital herpes and syphilis, challenge even the most astute clinician given the considerable overlap in clinical presentation and lack of widely available diagnostic resources, such as nucleic acid testing, to confirm the diagnosis. Even so, case prevalence is relatively low, and incidence of chancroid and granuloma inguinale are declining. These diseases still cause substantial morbidity and increased chance for HIV acquisition, and with the recent advent of mpox as a cause, it remains imperative to identify and treat accurately.

### Genital ulcer disease treatment for reducing sexual acquisition of HIV [^116GAR9H]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Genital ulcer disease by virtue of disruption of the mucosal surfaces may enhance HIV acquisition. Genital ulcer disease treatment with resolution of the ulcers may therefore contribute in reducing the sexual acquisition of HIV.

Objectives

To determine the effects of treatment of genital ulcer disease on sexual acquisition of HIV.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, EMBASE, LILACS, NLM Gateway, Web of Science, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, and reference lists of relevant publications for eligible studies published between 1980 and August 2011.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials of any treatment intervention aimed at curing genital ulcer disease compared with an alternative treatment, placebo, or no treatment. We included only trials whose unit of randomization was the individual with confirmed genital ulcer.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently selected studies and extracted data in duplicate; resolving discrepancies by discussion, consensus, and arbitration by third review author. We expressed study results as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

There were three randomized controlled trials that met our inclusion criteria recruited HIV-negative participants with chancroid (two trials with 143 participants) and primary syphilis (one trial with 30 participants). The syphilis study, carried out in the US between 1995 and 1997, randomized participants to receive a single 2.0 g oral dose of azithromycin (11 participants); two 2.0 g oral doses of azithromycin administered six to eight days apart (eight participants); or benzathine penicillin G administered as either 2.4 million units intramuscular injection once or twice seven days apart (11 participants). No participant in the trial seroconverted during 12 months of follow-up. The chancroid trials, conducted in Kenya by 1990, found no significant differences in HIV seroconversion rates during four to 12 weeks of follow-up between 400 and 200 mg single oral doses of fleroxacin (one trial, 45 participants; RR 3.00; 95% CI 0.29 to 30.69), or between 400 mg fleroxacin and 800 mg sulfamethoxazole plus 160 mg trimethoprim (one trial, 98 participants; RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.04 to 3.09). Adverse events reported were mild to moderate in severity, and included Jarisch-Herxheimer reactions and gastrointestinal symptoms. The differences between the treatment arms in the incidence of adverse events were not significant. The quality of this evidence on the effectiveness of genital ulcer disease treatment in reducing sexual acquisition of HIV, according to GRADE methodology, is of very low quality.

Authors' Conclusions

At present, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether curative treatment of genital ulcer disease would reduce the risk of HIV acquisition. The very low quality of the evidence implies that the true effect of genital ulcer disease treatment on sexual acquisition of HIV may be substantially different from the effect estimated from currently available data. However, genital ulcer diseases are public health problems in their own right and patients with these conditions should be treated appropriately; whether the treatment reduces the risk of HIV infection or not.

### Oral ulcers as a presentation of secondary syphilis [^114FKaM1]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

The incidence of syphilis is increasing, and it typically presents in patients with known risk factors, often to genitourinary physicians. Patients presenting to a dermatologist or ophthalmologist will more likely have secondary syphilis, with the potential for having the associated complications. Early recognition is therefore vital to limit both the disease and risk of further contact spread. In this review, we include two case histories demonstrating the value of recognizing oral signs. Additionally, we review the currently accepted diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations.

Warts/Condyloma diagnosis — Diagnosis of genital and oral warts is made by visual inspection and can be confirmed by biopsy. However, biopsy is needed only if the diagnosis is uncertain, the lesions do not respond to standard therapy, or the warts are pigmented, indurated, fixed, bleeding, or ulcerated. No data support the use of HPV testing for screening, diagnosis, or management of visible genital/oral warts or oral HPV disease in people with HIV.

Latent Syphilis

Latent syphilis is defined as syphilis characterized by seroreactivity without other evidence of primary, secondary, or tertiary disease. Persons who have latent syphilis and who acquired syphilis during the preceding year are classified as having early latent syphilis (early nonprimary, nonsecondary). Persons can receive a diagnosis of early latent syphilis if, during the year preceding the diagnosis, they had a documented seroconversion or a sustained (> 2 weeks) fourfold or greater increase in nontreponemal test titers in a previously treated person; unequivocal symptoms of primary or secondary syphilis; or a sex partner documented to have primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis. In addition, for persons with reactive nontreponemal and treponemal tests whose only possible exposure occurred during the previous 12 months, early latent syphilis can be assumed.

In the absence of these conditions associated with latent syphilis, an asymptomatic person should be considered to have latent syphilis of unknown duration or late latent syphilis (> 1 year's duration). Nontreponemal serologic titers usually are higher early in the course of syphilis infection. However, early latent syphilis cannot be reliably diagnosed solely on the basis of nontreponemal titers. All persons with latent syphilis should have careful examination of all accessible mucosal surfaces to evaluate for mucosal lesions (primary or secondary syphilis) before making a latent syphilis diagnosis. Physical examination should include the oral cavity, perianal area, perineum, rectum, and genitals (vagina and cervix for women; scrotum, penis, and underneath the foreskin for uncircumcised men).

### Acute oral ulcers [^116BNiLi]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

In general, a detailed history and examination of the patient provides sufficient information for diagnosis. The pattern, frequency, and natural history of ulcer episodes are helpful. The presence or absence of associated features and the site of oral involvement guides most physicians accurately in the diagnosis. Additional investigations, including blood tests, and occasionally the use of oral cultures or biopsy, are needed to make a definitive diagnosis. A multispecialty approach is often necessary to evaluate patients with other systemic features. Most acute oral ulcers heal spontaneously without specific therapy being necessary, but an understanding of the cause of the ulcer is reassuring to the patient and guides the clinician in management to prevent recurrent episodes of oral ulceration, or chronicity of ulcers.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^111KDthH]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) clinical manifestations — Orolabial herpes is the most common manifestation of HSV-1 infection, with oral lesions evolving from papule to vesicle, ulcer, and crust; in untreated persons, the course of illness is 5 to 10 days and lesions recur 1 to 12 times per year. The majority of individuals with HSV-2 seropositivity have clinically silent infection, and genital herpes is typically caused by HSV-2, though HSV-2 can also cause orolabial herpes; genital HSV-1 is clinically indistinguishable from HSV-2 but recurrences and viral shedding occur less often. Typical genital mucosal or skin lesions evolve through papule, vesicle, ulcer, and crust, and viral shedding on mucosal surfaces occurs frequently and can result in transmission. HSV shedding occurs more frequently in people with HIV with CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell counts < 200 cells/mm3 than in those without HIV or with higher CD4 counts.

Best of five questions

Question 1

A 23-year-old man presented with an 8-week history of bloody diarrhoea, severe anorectal pain and low-grade pyrexia. On further questioning he also complained of malaise, myalgia and arthralgia. He admitted to unprotected receptive anal sexual intercourse with two male partners in the preceding 6 months. Perianal and rectal examination revealed two fluctuant, tender areas of induration adjacent to the anal verge suggestive of abscesses. An urgent flexible sigmoidoscopy revealed inflamed, friable rectal mucosa with several large ulcers and spontaneous bleeding. Rectal swabs sent for NAAT and genotyping revealed the presence of C trachomatis genotype L1.

Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment regimen:
A — Doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 7 days
B — Erythromycin 250 mg four times a day for 21 days
C — Olfloxacin 400 mg a day for 7 days
D — Erythromycin 500 mg twice a day for 7 days
E — Doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 21 days

Question 2

### Pragmatic and profound benefits of acyclovir buccal adhesive tablets [^111CLvR1]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

The clinician has many options, both systemic and topical, for the management of oro-labial herpes simplex infections due to HSV-1. A recent addition to this armamentarium is Acyclovir 50 mg Buccal Adhesive Tablets (ABT 50mg). While this agent demonstrates the typical modest reduction in time to healing of any given episode of recurrent oro-labial HSV 1, it also was found in pivotal studies to alter the course of this troublesome viral disease. Several case reports are presented which dramatically illustrate that ABT 50mg can reduce the overall number of overt outbreaks and increase the time interval between outbreaks in patients with historical evidence of frequent episodes. This therapeutic intervention is thus: simple, safe, efficacious and cost-effective, even in patients who experience numerous (and therefore disconcerting) oro-labial outbreaks. <br/> <br/> J Drugs Dermatol. 2016;15(6):775–777.

### Acute oral ulcers [^115fGk19]. Clinics in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Accurate diagnosis of acute oral ulcers can be challenging. Important historic details include the pattern of recurrence, anatomic areas of involvement within the mouth and elsewhere on the mucocutaneous surface, associated medical symptoms or comorbidities, and symptomology. Careful mucocutaneous examination is essential. When necessary, biopsy at an active site without ulceration is generally optimal. Depending on the clinical scenario, supplemental studies that may be useful include cultures; perilesional biopsy for direct immunofluorescence testing; and evaluation for infectious diseases, gluten sensitivity, inflammatory bowel disease, human immunodeficiency virus infection, connective tissue diseases, or hematinic deficiencies. Clinicians should maintain a broad differential diagnosis when evaluating patients with acute oral ulcers.

### Endoscopic urethrotomy versus open urethroplasty for men with bulbar urethral stricture: the OPEN randomised trial cost-effectiveness analysis [^114ZXvGY]. BMC Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bulbar urethral stricture is a common cause for urinary symptoms (typically difficulty in passing urine) in men. Initial treatment is usually by endoscopic urethrotomy, a procedure that produces widening of the narrowed urethral segment by incising the stricture internally under vision. In about 50% of the cases the stricture will recur requiring re-treatment. This can be via a repeat endoscopic urethrotomy, graduated dilatation or formally repaired by urethroplasty with either excision of the stricture and anastomosis, or augmentation using a graft such as buccal mucosa.

Urethrotomy is most commonly performed for recurrent bulbar stricture because it is minimally invasive, does not require specialist surgical expertise, and has a short period of urethral catheterisation and recovery. However, further recurrence is likely. Open urethroplasty is more invasive, requires specialist expertise, a longer period of catheterisation and a more protracted return to normal activities. Nevertheless, urethroplasty may offer the prospect of long-term cure without the need for further interventions. When men are choosing between these two options, they have to make a trade-off between the invasiveness and effectiveness of each operation. Current decision-making is therefore determined by the availability of local expertise, clinician guidance, patient co-morbidity, and patient preferences.

The guidelines from the American Urological Association (AUA) and Société Internationale d'Urologie (SIU) recommend treatment with endoscopic techniques for first time bulbar strictures. For recurrent strictures the guideline recommendations differ, with the AUA recommending urethroplasty and the SIU recommending endoscopic approaches or urethroplasty if symptomatic recurrence is after more than 3 months. The reviews underpinning published guidelines, sponsored jointly by the SIU, the International Consultation on Urologic Disease and by the AUA, included non-randomised studies, predominantly of retrospective cohort design. Consequently the formulation of the guideline recommendation subsequent to these reviews was predominantly based on expert opinion and panel consensus rather than any robust evidence of the relative effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of these two treatment options.

To address this evidence gap, a randomised controlled trial (RCT) was conducted to compare the clinical and cost-effectiveness of urethroplasty versus endoscopic urethrotomy for the alleviation of urinary symptoms in men with recurrent bulbar stricture over 24 months (the OPEN (open urethroplasty versus endoscopic urethrotomy) Trial). Clinical results of the OPEN trial are presented elsewhere. This paper presents the cost-effectiveness analysis results.

### EAU guidelines on urological infections [^117W8KUa]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for genital herpes, more specifically with respect to initial assessment, EAU 2025 guidelines recommend to elicit a comprehensive medical history, including a history of previous sexual contacts, from all patients presenting with genital ulcers potentially related to HSV.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^117XjXaP]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

A diagnosis based only on medical history and physical examination frequently can be inaccurate. Therefore, all persons who have genital, anal, or perianal ulcers should be evaluated. Specific evaluation of genital, anal, or perianal ulcers includes syphilis serology tests and darkfield examination from lesion exudate or tissue, or NAAT if available; NAAT or culture for genital herpes type 1 or 2; and serologic testing for type-specific HSV antibody. In settings where chancroid is prevalent, a NAAT or culture for Haemophilus ducreyi should be performed.

No FDA-cleared NAAT for diagnosing syphilis is available in the United States; however, multiple FDA-cleared NAATs are available for diagnosing HSV-1 and HSV-2 in genital specimens. Certain clinical laboratories have developed their own syphilis and HSV NAATs and have conducted Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) verification studies with genital specimens. Type-specific serology for HSV-2 might aid in identifying persons with genital herpes (see Genital Herpes). In addition, biopsy of ulcers with immunohistochemistry can help identify the cause of ulcers that are unusual or that do not respond to initial therapy. HIV testing should be performed on all persons not known to have HIV infection who present with genital, anal, or perianal ulcers (see Diagnostic Considerations in disease-specific sections). NAAT testing at extragenital sites should be considered for cases in which GUDs are suspected (e.g. oral manifestations of syphilis, herpes, or LGV). Commercially available NAATs have not been cleared by FDA for these indications; however, they can be used by laboratories that have met regulatory requirements for an off-label procedure.

Diagnosis is usually based on serology, using a combination of treponemal and non-treponemal tests. Syphilis remains sensitive to benzathine penicillin G
Staging syphilis is important because it is the basis of management (treatment, expected treatment response, follow-up periods, and partner follow-up)
Patients with syphilis should be screened for HIV, gonorrhoea, and chlamydia

Caused by the bacteria Treponema pallidum, syphilis is transmitted through direct (usually sexual) contact with infected mucosal lesions. Other bodily fluids are also infectious when patients are bacteraemic. With infectivity up to 10–30% per sexual contact or 60% per relationship, syphilis rates have risen 300% since 2000 in many Western countries. While most infections involve men who have sex with men, infections among people with opposite sex partners also occur. In addition to increasing rates, syphilis can cause early complications such as irreversible loss of vision, so awareness of the infection is important for primary care clinicians.

The child has experienced penetration or has evidence of recent or healed penetrative injury to the genitals, anus, or oropharynx.
The child has been abused by a stranger.
The child has been abused by an assailant known to be infected with an STI or at high risk for STIs (e.g. injecting drug user, MSM, person with multiple sex partners, or person with a history of STIs).
The child has a sibling, other relative, or another person in the household with an STI.
The child lives in an area with a high rate of STIs in the community.
The child has signs or symptoms of STIs (e.g. vaginal discharge or pain, genital itching or odor, urinary symptoms, or genital lesions or ulcers).
The child or parent requests STI testing.
The child is unable to verbalize details of the assault.

If a child has symptoms, signs, or evidence of an infection that might be sexually transmitted, the child should be tested for common STIs before initiation of any treatment that might interfere with diagnosing other STIs. Because of the legal and psychosocial consequences of a false-positive diagnosis, only tests with high specificities should be used. The potential benefit to the child of a reliable STI diagnosis justifies deferring presumptive treatment until specimens for highly specific tests are obtained by providers with experience in evaluating sexually abused and assaulted children.

Evaluations should be performed on a case-by-case basis, according to history of assault or abuse and in a manner that minimizes the possibility for psychological trauma and social stigma. If the initial exposure was recent, the infectious organisms acquired through the exposure might not have produced sufficient concentrations to result in positive test results or examination findings. Alternatively, positive test results after a recent exposure might represent the assailant's secretions (but would nonetheless be an indication for treatment of the child). A second visit approximately 2–6 weeks after the most recent sexual exposure should be scheduled to include a repeat physical examination and collection of additional specimens to identify any infection that might not have been detected at the time of initial evaluation. A single evaluation might be sufficient if the child was abused for an extended period and if a substantial amount of time elapsed between the last suspected episode of abuse and the medical evaluation. Compliance with follow-up appointments might be improved when law enforcement personnel or child protective services are involved.

Candidiasis (mucocutaneous) — clinical manifestations: Oropharyngeal candidiasis (oral thrush) is characterized by painless, creamy white, plaque-like lesions that can occur on the buccal surface, hard or soft palate, gums, oropharynx, or tongue surface, and lesions can often be scraped off with a tongue depressor or other instrument. A proportion of people with HIV who have oropharyngeal candidiasis also manifest esophageal involvement; clinicians should ascertain whether there are symptoms suggestive of esophageal disease in people with oropharyngeal candidiasis. Esophageal candidiasis generally presents with retrosternal burning pain or discomfort along with odynophagia; it can be asymptomatic, endoscopy reveals whitish plaques similar to oropharyngeal disease, and plaques may progress to superficial ulcerations of the esophageal mucosa with central or peripheral whitish exudates. In people with HIV, Candida vulvovaginitis usually presents with white adherent vaginal discharge associated with mucosal burning and itching of mild-to-moderate severity with sporadic recurrences, is less common in people with HIV, and when it occurs is uncommonly refractory to azole therapy unless caused by non-C. albicans species; in those with advanced immunosuppression, episodes may be more severe and recur more frequently.

Candidiasis (mucocutaneous) clinical manifestations include oropharyngeal candidiasis characterized by painless, creamy white, plaque-like lesions on the buccal surface, hard or soft palate, oropharyngeal mucosa, or tongue surface that can be easily scraped off; less commonly, erythematous patches without white plaques occur and angular cheilosis can be caused by Candida. Because a proportion of patients with oropharyngeal candidiasis also manifest esophageal involvement, clinicians should ascertain whether there are symptoms suggestive of esophageal disease in patients with oropharyngeal candidiasis. Esophageal candidiasis generally presents with retrosternal burning pain or discomfort along with odynophagia; occasionally esophageal candidiasis can be asymptomatic, and endoscopic examination reveals whitish plaques that on occasion may progress to superficial ulcerations with central or peripheral whitish exudates. In women with HIV infection, Candida vulvovaginitis usually presents with white adherent vaginal discharge associated with mucosal burning and itching of mild-to-moderate severity and sporadic recurrences; in women with advanced immunosuppression, episodes may be more severe and recur more frequently; and vulvovaginal candidiasis is less common than oropharyngeal candidiasis and when it occurs, it is uncommonly refractory to azole therapy unless caused by non-C. albicans species.

### PCR testing for diagnosis of mucocutaneous ulcers suspicious for syphilis [^115ZGtwd]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary syphilis is characterised by the appearance of an ulcerated lesion (chancre) on the anogenital or oral mucosa from which Treponema pallidum DNA may be detectable by PCR. Serological tests for syphilis may be non-reactive in early infection, even after the appearance of a chancre. We reviewed the use of a multiplex-PCR (M-PCR) test to determine the added value of T. pallidum DNA detection in the management of individuals presenting with mucocutaneous ulceration at a sexual health service in central London.

Methods

We performed a cross-sectional analysis of all individuals with detectable T. pallidum DNA from September 2019 to April 2020. Electronic patient records were reviewed and concomitant results for treponemal serology and/or rapid plasma reagin (RPR) extracted, along with demographic data, history of syphilis and indices of sexual behaviour including number of sexual partners contacted. Any subsequent treponemal serology and RPR results were also reviewed.

Results

M-PCR swab specimens were performed in 450 individuals, of whom 63 (14%) had detectable T. pallidum DNA; 60 of 63 (95%) were gay or bisexual men and 11 of 63 (17%) were living with HIV. A history of treated syphilis was present in 17 of 63 (27%). Same-day treponemal serology/RPR testing was performed in 58 of 63 (92%) patients. Of the 58 who had same-day syphilis serology/RPR, 9 (16%) had their syphilis infection confirmed by treponemal DNA PCR alone. A total of 165 partners were traced as contacts of infection, of whom 25 (15%) were contacts of individuals diagnosed by M-PCR testing alone.

Conclusion

In individuals with T. pallidum PCR-positive lesions, around one in six in our cohort were negative on standard diagnostic serological tests for syphilis. Treponemal DNA testing is an important addition to serological assays in individuals with mucocutaneous ulceration who are at risk of recent syphilis infection and facilitates early diagnosis and contact tracing.

Since May 2022, more than 6,900 cases of monkeypox virus infection have been reported in 52 countries. The World Health Organization is planning to rename the virus and its clades to reduce stigma. As of July 5, 2022, 556 cases have been reported in 33 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. The initial cases were travel-associated; however, person-to-person transmission is now occurring domestically. Close, sustained skin-to-skin contact, including during sexual activity, appears to be the primary mode of transmission. The risk of widespread community transmission remains low; however, rapid identification of monkeypox virus infection and isolation of affected individuals is critical to prevent further transmission. Most but not all cases have occurred in males; some infections have started with anogenital lesions and can be mistaken for common sexually transmitted infections. To facilitate rapid, accurate diagnosis of monkeypox virus infection, obstetrician-gynecologists (ob-gyns) in the United States should ask about recent travel history and new ulcers or lesions and perform a thorough visual inspection of skin and mucosal sites (oral, genital, perianal area) in patients presenting with new rash. Obstetrician-gynecologists should become familiar with the appearance of monkeypox lesions and know whom to call to report a suspected case, how and when to test for monkeypox virus, and how to counsel patients. In the event of a suspected case, ob-gyns should follow infection-control guidelines to prevent transmission and make recommendations to prevent further community spread. This article outlines the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of monkeypox virus infection, monkeypox virus infection during pregnancy, and implications for practicing ob-gyns in the United States.

HIV-associated HSV — considerations for starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) — Orolabial and genital HSV should not influence the decision on when to start ART in persons with HIV. Transient increases in HSV-2–associated genital ulcers have been observed during the first 6 months after initiation of ART in HIV/HSV-2 coinfected persons; in such cases, suppressive anti-HSV therapy can be considered. The frequency and severity of clinical episodes of genital herpes is often reduced in individuals after immune reconstitution on ART; however, immune reconstitution does not reduce the frequency of genital HSV shedding.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) disease clinical manifestations — oral HSV-1 illness in untreated patients lasts 5 days to 10 days and lesions recur 1 to 12 times per year, and genital HSV shedding occurs more frequently in persons with CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell counts < 200 cells/mm3 than in those with higher counts, while in profoundly immunocompromised patients extensive, deep, nonhealing ulcerations have been reported most often in those with CD4 counts < 100 cells/mm3. Increasingly, first-episode genital herpes is caused by HSV-1 and is indistinguishable from HSV-2 infection, but recurrences and viral shedding occur less often with genital HSV-1 infection.

Other Management Considerations

To minimize transmission and reinfection, patients treated for acute proctitis should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their partners have been treated (i.e. until completion of a 7-day regimen and symptoms have resolved). Studies have reported that behaviors that facilitate enteric pathogen transmission might be associated with acquisition of other STIs, including HIV infection. All persons with acute proctitis and concern for sexually transmitted proctocolitis or enteritis should be tested for HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia (at other exposed sites). PEP should be considered for exposures that present a risk for HIV acquisition. For ongoing risk for HIV acquisition, PrEP should be considered.

Evidence-based interventions for preventing acquisition of sexually transmitted enteric pathogens are not available. However, extrapolating from general infection control practices for communicable diseases and established STI prevention practices, recommendations include avoiding contact with feces during sex, using barriers, and washing hands after handing materials that have been in contact with the anal area (i.e. barriers and sex toys) and after touching the anus or rectal area.

Follow-Up

Follow-up should be based on specific etiology and severity of clinical symptoms. For proctitis associated with gonorrhea or chlamydia, retesting for the respective pathogen should be performed 3 months after treatment.

Management of Sex Partners

Partners who have had sexual contact with persons treated for gonorrhea or chlamydia < 60 days before the onset of the persons symptoms should be evaluated, tested, and presumptively treated for the respective infection. Partners of persons with proctitis should be evaluated for any diseases diagnosed in the index partner. Sex partners should abstain from sexual contact until they and their partners are treated. No specific recommendations are available for screening or treating sex partners of persons with diagnosed sexually transmitted enteric pathogens; however, partners should seek care if symptomatic.

Special Considerations

Drug Allergy, Intolerance, and Adverse Reactions

Allergic reactions with third-generation cephalosporins (e.g. ceftriaxone) are uncommon among persons with a history of penicillin allergy.

HIV Infection

Persons with HIV infection and acute proctitis might present with bloody discharge, painful perianal ulcers, or mucosal ulcers and LGV and herpes proctitis are more prevalent among this population. Presumptive treatment in such cases should include a regimen for genital herpes and LGV.

### Herpes simplex virus keratitis: a treatment guideline-2014 [^115f5YQi]. AAO (2014). Medium credibility.

Natural history — Initial infection describes transmission and asymptomatic shedding of herpes simplex virus (HSV). HSV is typically spread by direct contact, most often from virus shed into saliva or genital secretions, and can be acquired by contact with virus-laden saliva of asymptomatic individuals, who may be a common source of transmission. After initial acquisition of HSV-1, active replication in mucosa or skin spreads through neurons to dorsal root ganglia or, in the face, the trigeminal ganglia. Some patients have symptoms during the initial acute infection but most do not, and nearly two-thirds of primary HSV infections are either unrecognized or asymptomatic.

### Genital ulcers: differential diagnosis and management [^111dQMhd]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Genital ulcers may be located on the vagina, penis, and anorectal or perineal areas and may be infectious or noninfectious. Herpes simplex virus is the most common cause of genital ulcers in the United States. A diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus infection is made through physical examination and observation of genital lesions. The 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sexually transmitted disease guidelines provide strategies for the management of patients with genital ulcer disease. Specific testing includes a polymerase chain reaction test for herpes simplex virus; syphilis serology and darkfield microscopy or a direct fluorescent antibody test for Treponema pallidum; and/or culture for Haemophilus ducreyi in settings where chancroid is highly prevalent. Rarely, cases of Epstein-Barr virus may present with genital ulcers. Syphilis and chancroid cause genital ulcers and are mandatory reportable diseases to the local health department. In some cases, no pathogen is identified. It is important to consider noninfectious etiologies such as sexual trauma, psoriasis, Behçet syndrome, and fixed drug eruptions. Genital ulcers are symptomatic by definition, and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for syphilis infection for those at risk, early screening for syphilis infection in all pregnant women, and against routine serologic screening for genital herpes simplex virus infection in asymptomatic adolescents and adults, including those who are pregnant.

### Painful facial, oral, and genital ulcers [^1118kGyS]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

A 32-year-old otherwise healthy male presented to the dermatology clinic in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with a 2-day history of multiple painful, non-pruritic ulcers in the genital and facial regions, fever, odynophagia, headache, and fatigue. Physical examination revealed pustules and vesicles with central umbilication at the same stage of development and targetoid crusted ulcers on the right inguinal area (Fig 1), base of the penis, right gluteal region, and left cheek along with bilateral painful inguinal adenopathy. The oropharynx showed erythematous patches and erosions with white exudate.

Question 1: Based on the clinical presentation, what is the most likely etiology of the patient's ulcers?
A. Treponema pallidum
B. Monkeypox virus
C. Herpes simplex virus (HSV)
D. Candida albicans
E. Non-infectious inflammation

Answers:

A. Treponema pallidum – Incorrect. Primary syphilis infection is classically characterized by a painless genital ulcer, often associated with non-tender inguinal lymphadenopathy. Serologies for syphilis were negative in this case.
B. Monkeypox virus – Correct. Upon further questioning, the patient reported frequent unprotected sexual intercourse with alternating male partners and recent contact with symptomatic partners. After 7 days, the patient developed additional lesions on the bilateral thighs, face, right anterior neck, and buttocks. Lesions evolved to erosions with overlying crusts, with spontaneous resolution of all lesions after 3 weeks. Monkeypox is a zoonotic Orthopoxvirus. Beginning in May of 2022, a rapid increase in the number of monkeypox cases emerged. Historically, lesions began on the face and spread across the trunk and extremities. In the current outbreak, it has been observed that lesions begin primarily in the genital region in men who have sex with men.
C. HSV – Incorrect. Genital herpes presents as painful grouped vesicles or ulcers. Disseminated HSV could present as facial and genital ulcers in an immunocompromised patient. Serologies for HIV were negative.
D. Candida albicans – Incorrect. Cutaneous candidiasis presents as bright red erythema surrounded by satellite pustules and papules in moist areas. Deep fungal infections can cause genital ulcers but C. albicans is not the typical pathogen.
E. Non-infectious inflammation – Incorrect. Behcet syndrome is characterized by recurrent oral apthae associated with genital ulcers. The precise etiology is unknown, but an autoimmune etiology has been proposed. The classic triad includes uveitis as well.

### Infectious proctitis: what every gastroenterologist needs to know [^113eLpPb]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

T. pallidum

Syphilis is a chronic bacterial infection caused by a spirochete, T. pallidum, whose incidence has risen steadily in recent years in Western Europe and the Americas, mainly in the MSM population. Patients may be completely asymptomatic, and diagnosis is made as a result of incidental screening. When patients are symptomatic, the signs or symptoms may vary according to the stage of the disease.

In primary syphilis that appears within 3 months (average 2–3 weeks) after direct contact with another person's infectious skin lesions, an anogenital lesion is typically solitary, painless, ulcerative and indurated, with a clean base and discharge of serous fluid (chancre). Regional lymphadenopathy may also be present in the genitalia, mouth or rectum.

If not identified and properly treated, infection may progress to the secondary stage, typically in 6–12 weeks. In fact, secondary syphilis is the most common recognized clinical syndrome of syphilis, particularly among women or MSM. In this stage, a multisystem disease is described and can include several manifestations, such as maculopapular rash (typically palmoplantar), oral ulceration, proctitis and condylomata lata (wart-like papules commonly located in the perianal or genital area). Tertiary infection, which may occur several years after primary or secondary disease, can have major neurological or cardiovascular sequelae.

Syphilitic proctitis is rarely reported, but is being recognized more frequently because of the increasing incidence of syphilis among MSM. The signs and symptoms of proctitis are nonspecific, such as rectal bleeding, rectal pain, mucus and rectal fullness. The endoscopic appearance of the rectum may include edema, erythema, multiple friable erosions or ulcerations.

The presumptive diagnosis of syphilis is made using serologic tests that should include nontreponemal and treponemal tests (Table 2). For those without prior syphilis, either test can be used as the initial screening test. Confirmatory testing is necessary given the potential for false-positive screening test results (dark field microscopy/direct fluorescent antibody testing) or PCR of ulcer exudate, condylomata exudate or rectal biopsies.

First-line treatment of primary and secondary syphilis is penicillin G benzathine, 2.4 million units i.m. q.d. Second-line therapy with doxycycline or ceftriaxone can be considered (Table 2).

The Study

In February 2019, a 25-year-old man with a history of having sex with men with advanced HIV infection sought care at the Wayne State University Physician Group Infectious Diseases Clinic in Detroit, Michigan, USA, for 2 large ulcers over his lower lip. He had noticed the ulcers 2 weeks earlier, associated with pain and purulent discharge, along with a rapidly enlarging, painful swelling over his upper left neck. He reported no history of fever or chills. He also reported having had unprotected insertive and receptive oral and anal sex with > 30 male partners during the previous year. He reported that he found anonymous sexual contacts by using "sex apps" and did not trade sex for drugs or money. In 2007, the patient had received a diagnosis of HIV infection and was taking antiretroviral drugs intermittently. His medical history included syphilis, gonorrhea, and genital chlamydia infections.

Physical examination revealed that the patient was afebrile with stable vital signs. His lower lip was markedly swollen and tender, with 2 large, purulent ulcers: 1 deep ulcer on the central lower lip and 1 over the left side near the angle of his mouth. Also, left-sided submandibular adenopathy was present as a large (≈10 cm diameter), tender, nonfluctuant swelling, which was neither warm nor erythematous. His oropharynx, buccal mucosa, and tongue appeared normal. Results of the rest of the examination, including the external genitalia, groin, and perianal region, were unremarkable.

Diagnostic testing of the lip ulcer included nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) for herpes simplex viruses (HSVs) 1 and 2 and Chlamydia (Roche LightCycler real-time PCR for HSVs 1 and 2; BD Viper XTR technology for GC/CT NAAT). We performed NAAT on pharyngeal samples to test for C. trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Additional diagnostics included rapid plasma reagin testing, serologic testing for treponema, HIV viral load measurement, and CD4+ lymphocyte count. Valacyclovir was empirically prescribed; however, the patient did not fill this prescription.

Because approximately all HSV-2 infections are sexually acquired, presence of type-specific HSV-2 antibody implies anogenital infection. In this instance, education and counseling for persons with genital HSV infections should be provided. The presence of HSV-1 antibody alone is more difficult to interpret. HSV-1 serologic testing does not distinguish between oral and genital infection and typically should not be performed for diagnosing genital HSV-1 infection. Persons with HSV-1 antibodies often have oral HSV infection acquired during childhood, which might be asymptomatic. Lack of symptoms in a person who is HSV-1 seropositive does not distinguish anogenital from orolabial or cutaneous infection, and, regardless of site of infection, these persons remain at risk for acquiring HSV-2. In addition, HSV-1 serologic testing has low sensitivity for detection of HSV-1 antibody. However, acquisition of HSV-1 genital herpes is increasing, and HSV-1 genital herpes also can be asymptomatic. Diagnosis of HSV-1 infection is confirmed by virologic tests from genital lesions.

Type-specific HSV-2 serologic assays for diagnosing HSV-2 are useful in the following scenarios: recurrent or atypical genital symptoms or lesions with a negative HSV PCR or culture result, clinical diagnosis of genital herpes without laboratory confirmation, and a patient's partner has genital herpes. HSV-2 serologic screening among the general population is not recommended. Patients who are at higher risk for infection (e.g. those presenting for an STI evaluation, especially for persons with ≥ 10 lifetime sex partners, and persons with HIV infection) might need to be assessed for a history of genital herpes symptoms, followed by type-specific HSV serologic assays to diagnose genital herpes for those with genital symptoms.

### Unusual causes of cutaneous ulceration [^113WVoSC]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Skin ulceration is a major source of morbidity and is often difficult to manage. Ulcers caused by an inflammatory cause or microvascular occlusion are particularly challenging in terms of diagnosis and treatment. The management of such ulcers requires careful assessment of associated systemic conditions and a thorough analysis of the ulcer's clinical and histologic findings. In this article, the authors discuss several examples of inflammatory ulcers and the approach to the diagnosis and treatment of these ulcers.

### Syphilis [^111dxTSU]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

What symptoms should alert me to this diagnosis?

While syphilis causes protean symptoms (box 1), the diagnosis should be considered in any sexually active patient with genital lesions or with rashes.

Box 1
Symptoms of syphilis by stage of infection (see fig 1)

Primary syphilis — Patients with primary syphilis (fig 1) have a chancre at the site of inoculation — classically a solitary, painless, indurated, non-exudative ulcer (fig 2). While often on the glans, corona, labia, fourchette, or perineum, it may occur in the mouth (fig 3), rectum, or vagina. Chancres can be inconspicuous (fig 4) and resolve in 3–10 weeks, possibly explaining why 60% of patients do not recall this lesion. Chancres may be multiple, painful, or atypical due to coinfection with other bacteria or herpesvirus. Depending on inoculum size, chancres appear 10–90 days after exposure (mean 21 days). Localised painless adenopathy may occur.

Secondary syphilis — Secondary syphilis is a manifestation of bacterial dissemination and classically presents as a diffuse, symmetric, copper, maculopapular, possibly pruritic rash of any morphology except vesicular (fig 5). A rash on the palms or soles is common (11–70%, fig 6). Mucus lesions (fig 7), patchy alopecia, fever, headaches, and generalised painless adenopathy may also occur. Early neurosyphilis develops in 25–60% of people (box 1). Secondary symptoms appear 2–24 weeks after infection, concurrently with or up to eight weeks after chancres, and disappear spontaneously after several weeks with or without marking.

### Acute hepatitis C and HIV coinfection [^116nvdi2]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2009). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis C is a common infection worldwide, but acute infection is often asymptomatic and difficult to diagnose. People coinfected with HIV and hepatitis C might progress to chronic liver disease more quickly. We present a case of a man infected with HIV with sexually acquired acute hepatitis C and discuss the immunology, natural history, and epidemiology of acute hepatitis C and coinfection with HIV. Several recent reports have documented acute hepatitis C among men who have sex with men who engage in high risk sexual practices and often have concomitant genital ulcer disease. We review treatment options for the medical management of acute hepatitis C and coinfection with HIV.

### Sexually transmitted infections manifesting as proctitis [^112CNjiL]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus

Caused by either herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 or type 2, primary herpes simplex infection may be asymptomatic, but 40% of men and 70% of women will develop systemic features that include malaise, headaches and muscle pains. HSV ascends peripheral sensory nerves then lies dormant in sensory or autonomic ganglia where it can later reactivate. Recurrent HSV occurs in approximately 60% of those infected with type 1 HSV and 90% in type 2 HSV. Proctitis is usually associated with anal intercourse and diagnostic suspicion should be raised in the presence of perianal vesicles or painful oral/anogenital ulceration.

PCR on rectal biopsy, or exudate from a lesion is the current ideal diagnostic modality for rectal HSV. Recommended treatment for acute infection is 5 days of either aciclovir 200 mg five times a day, aciclovir 400 mg three times a day, valaciclovir 500 mg twice a day, or famciclovir 125 mg twice a day. For recurrent HSV, aciclovir may be given four times a day for up to 1 year; however, only 20% of patients will see a subsequent reduction in disease recurrence.

It should be appreciated that anogenital ulcers associated with both HSV and syphilis lead to a 1.5 to sevenfold increase in HIV transmission due to the associated mucosal barrier breach, and so HIV testing should be undertaken.

### Management strategies for HIV-associated aphthous stomatitis [^1129wN2A]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is the most common oral mucosal disorder found in men and women of all ages, races, and geographic regions. There are three forms of the lesions (minor, major, and herpetiform), with major aphthous ulcers causing significant pain and potential for scarring. In HIV-infected individuals, these ulcers occur more frequently, last longer, and produce more painful symptoms than in immunocompetent persons. In addition, they may be associated with similar ulcerations involving the esophagus, rectum, anus, and genitals. The diagnosis of HIV-induced RAS requires a careful history of the condition, and a thorough extra- and intra-oral examination. Oral mucosal biopsies are required for non-healing ulcers in order to exclude the possibility of deep fungal infections, viral infections, and neoplasms. The cause of the ulcers in HIV-positive persons has not been elucidated — local diseases, genetic, immunologic, and infectious factors all probably play a role. The goals of current treatments are to promote ulcer healing, to reduce ulcer duration and pain while maintaining nutritional intake, and to prevent or diminish the frequency of recurrence. Initial therapy for infrequent RAS recurrences includes over-the-counter topical protective and analgesic products. Initial therapy for frequent RAS outbreaks requires topical anesthetics, binding agents, and corticosteroids. Major RAS and non-healing minor or herpetiform RAS may require intralesional corticosteroids and systemic prednisone. Second-line immunomodulators for frequent and non-healing ulcers includes thalidomide and other immunomodulators.

### Exuberant oral lesions in an immunocompromised patient [^113MCTro]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 3: Which of the statements below is not considered a risk factor for the disease in this case report?
A. Sexually active life
B. Immunosuppression
C. Complete HPV vaccine schedule
D. Self-inoculation
E. Unprotected sexual intercourse

Answers:

A. Sexually active life — Incorrect. Transmission occurs mainly through social contact, self-inoculation, and infected fomites as in this present case.
B. Immunosuppression — Incorrect. The risk factors for HPV infection include smoking, immunosuppression, and sexual behavior. As observed in the clinical picture, the patient had immunosuppression secondary to the HIV diagnosis.
C. Complete HPV vaccine schedule — Correct. Considering the oncogenic nature of HPV, patients should be instructed on the use of preventive methods and a HPV vaccine schedule.
D. Self-inoculation — Incorrect. It is transmitted through direct horizontal contact, such as anogenital intercourse with genital and/or oral contact with the mucous membranes of an infected area, or indirect contact, such as contaminated utensils. As reported, the patient had oral lesions consistent with this form of transmission.
E. Unprotected sexual intercourse — Incorrect. The main transmission form is self-innoculation or direct contact through unprotected sexual intercourse. Patients should be made aware of the use of preventive methods.

### Conjunctivitis, mucosal erosions, and moist cutaneous plaques [^116MBNLb]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A 25-year-old man with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy presented to the emergency department with a fever and 2-month history of recurrent painful mouth sores. A review of systems obtained from his mother was notable for weight loss, eye irritation, and an uncharacteristically wide-based gait. The physical examination found conjunctival injection, erosions on the labial and buccal mucosa, and moist malodorous exophytic periumbilical (Fig 1, A) and inguinal (Fig 2) plaques. Comprehensive metabolic panel and complete blood count were unremarkable; HIV screen was negative. The results of histopathologic examination of the periumbilical plaque are shown in Fig 1, B and C.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Secondary syphilis
B. Pyoderma gangrenosum
C. Pyodermatitis-pyostomatitis vegetans
D. Pemphigus vegetans
E. Herpes simplex virus infection
Answers:
A. Secondary syphilis – Incorrect. Secondary syphilis is caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum. It typically presents 1 to 3 months after the appearance of the primary chancre and is characterized by a generalized papulosquamous rash. Condyloma lata, moist exophytic plaques containing spirochetes, may develop in the oral and anogenital regions.
B. Pyoderma gangrenosum – Incorrect. Pyoderma gangrenosum is a neutrophilic dermatosis associated with a variety of systemic disorders including inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis, and blood dyscrasias. The classic lesion starts as a painful papule, pustule, or nodule that ulcerates with a violaceous undermined border. A rare superficial vegetative form of pyoderma gangrenosum has been described.
C. Pyodermatitis-pyostomatitis vegetans – Incorrect. Pyodermatitis-pyostomatitis vegetans, associated with inflammatory bowel disease, is characterized by sterile pustules on edematous mucosa that rupture to form "snail track" erosions. Pustules and brown annular vegetating plaques may develop on the skin, particularly overlying intertriginous areas.
D. Pemphigus vegetans – Correct. Pemphigus vegetans is the rarest variant of pemphigus vulgaris, an autoimmune bullous disease of the mucous membranes and skin characterized by IgG autoantibodies against the keratinocyte adhesion protein desmoglein (DSG) 3. It is clinically divided into the Neumann type, with extensive often intertriginous vegetations overlying blisters and erosions as observed in this case, and the relatively benign Hallopeau type, with grouped or annular pustules progressing to verrucous cobblestoned plaques.
E. Herpes simplex virus infection – Incorrect. Herpes simplex virus infection may be primary or recurrent. The classic presentation is umbilicated vesicles in the orolabial or anogenital regions that rupture to form painful ulcerations. The exophytic lesions of herpes simplex vegetans, a variant associated with immunodeficient states, can mimic verrucous carcinoma.

### The global and regional burden of genital ulcer disease due to herpes simplex virus: a natural history modelling study [^1179eUbN]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Second, the GUD estimates build on published WHO estimates of HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection, meaning the issues and assumptions affecting the infection estimates, including data availability, generalisability and quality, are carried forward to the GUD estimates. Furthermore, HSV-1 infection estimates were not produced separately by sex for all regions, meaning GUD estimates for HSV-1 may not fully capture differences by sex. However, the infection estimates were informed by systematic reviews to August 2018 and represent the best attempt to quantify HSV-2 and genital HSV-1 prevalence and incidence globally by age and sex. In some countries, such as the United States, an 'epidemiological transition' has already occurred whereby rates of oral HSV-1 infection during childhood have declined, and rates of genital HSV-1 infection have increased, due to decreased immunity to HSV-1 on entering adulthood possibly combined with increasing rates of oral sex. In the most recent prospective evaluation of GUD among women with new HSV infection, in North America, 62% of HSV GUD first episodes were caused by HSV-1. Our estimate for the Americas was similar, with 55% of first episodes due to HSV-1. Such trends may be occurring elsewhere in the world. Although the potential for genital HSV-1 infection postchildhood is uncertain, our analyses suggest that genital HSV-1 only makes a small contribution to all GUD globally, given the vastly greater number of HSV-2 recurrences.

Similarly, a third limitation concerns the availability, quality and representativeness of natural history data. Studies differed on a number of characteristics, including population group (women or men or both, or men who have sex with men), study location, method of identifying lesions (eg, clinician vs self-report) and length of follow-up. Pooling data from these disparate studies may have introduced bias in our pooled parameter estimates; however, if we excluded more studies, we would have further reduced the availability of data, particularly for settings outside of the United States. The vast majority of the data on first GUD episodes and recurrences, which informed our natural history parameters, came from studies in the United States, which may not reflect the natural history of HSV infection elsewhere. To help mitigate some of these issues, we applied specific inclusion and exclusion criteria for data extraction, pooled data from similar populations as far as possible (ie, those with diagnosed vs unrecognised infection), and standardised data prior to pooling (ie, converting medians to means, and calculating annualised recurrence frequencies).

Diseases Characterized by Genital, Anal, or Perianal Ulcers

In the United States, the majority of young, sexually active patients who have genital, anal, or perianal ulcers have either genital herpes or syphilis. The frequency of each condition differs by geographic area and population; however, genital herpes is the most prevalent of these diseases. More than one etiologic agent (e.g. herpes and syphilis) can be present in any genital, anal, or perianal ulcer. Less common infectious causes of genital, anal, or perianal ulcers include chancroid, LGV, and granuloma inguinale (donovanosis). GUDs (e.g. syphilis, herpes, and LGV) might also present as oral ulcers. Genital herpes, syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and chancroid have been associated with an increased risk for HIV acquisition and transmission. Genital, anal, or perianal lesions can also be associated with infectious and noninfectious conditions that are not sexually transmitted (e.g. yeast, trauma, carcinoma, aphthae or Behcet's disease, fixed drug eruption, or psoriasis).

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

HIV-associated herpes simplex virus (HSV) management — treating disease — Patients with HSV infections can be treated with episodic antiviral therapy when symptomatic lesions occur or with daily suppressive therapy to prevent recurrences, and acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir are effective for suppressive and episodic therapy; valacyclovir is the prodrug of acyclovir, and has improved oral bioavailability, with decreased dosing frequency, compared to acyclovir. Patients with orolabial HSV lesions can be treated with oral acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir for 5 days to 10 days (AIII). First episodes of genital HSV should be treated with oral acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir for 7 days to 10 days; recurrences can be treated for 5 to 10 days (AI). Severe mucocutaneous HSV lesions respond best to initial treatment with intravenous (IV) acyclovir (AIII); once the lesions begin to regress, patients can be switched to oral antiviral therapy and therapy should be continued until the lesions have completely healed. When deciding on suppressive therapy for genital HSV-2 infection in persons with HIV and HSV-2 coinfection, factors to consider include the frequency and severity of HSV recurrences and risk for genital ulcer disease (GUD) when initiating ART, and episodic treatment for individual recurrences of GUD does not influence the natural history of genital HSV-2 infection.

Acute and recent HIV infection — clinical suspicion and differential diagnosis: Health care providers should consider the possibility of acute HIV infection in symptomatic people and in asymptomatic people with a possible acute (within 2–6 weeks) exposure to HIV. Signs, symptoms, or laboratory findings may include fever, lymphadenopathy, skin rash, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, diarrhea, pharyngitis, oral ulcers, thrombocytopenia, and transaminase elevation. High-risk exposures include sexual contact with someone who has HIV or is at risk of HIV infection, sharing needles, syringes, or equipment for drug preparation or injection, or contact of mucous membranes or broken skin with bodily fluids that may carry HIV. The differential diagnosis may include COVID-19, EBV and non-EBV (e.g. CMV) infectious mononucleosis syndromes, influenza, viral hepatitis, streptococcal infection, or syphilis, and diagnosis of any STI should prompt HIV testing and consideration of acute HIV infection.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) disease — additional considerations note that HIV-infected patients may have larger or more numerous warts and may not respond as well to therapy compared with HIV-uninfected individuals; topical cidofovir has activity against genital warts, but the product is not commercially available (CIII); intralesional interferon-alpha is usually not recommended because of high cost, difficult administration, and potential for systemic side effects (CIII); the rate of recurrence of genital warts is high despite treatment in HIV-infected individuals; and for oral warts there is no consensus, many anogenital treatments can be applied to oral mucosa, and surgery is the most common treatment for oral warts that interfere with function or for aesthetic reasons.

### Comprehensive management of major aphthous ulcer [^113gqHCN]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Recurrent aphthous ulcers are the most prevalent oral mucosal disease, but the subset major aphthous ulcer is a less frequent type. These ulcers are refractory, may persist for several weeks to months, and interfere with the normal state of health. The aetiology is multifactorial and so is the treatment. We present a case of an adolescent male patient reported with multiple oral ulcers. He developed three ulcers simultaneously and suffered for 10 months despite using topical medications prescribed by different dental practitioners. We executed a multidisciplinary treatment approach that resulted in a long-term disease-free state. The treatment methods followed in our case could be a successful model to implement by medical practitioners and oral physicians when the situation demands.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis — genital, anal, oral and skin warts are usually diagnosed by visual inspection; a speculum examination may be required for cervical and vaginal lesions and anoscopy for intra-anal lesions, with biopsy considered if lesions do not respond to standard therapy or are pigmented, indurated, fixed, or ulcerated, and patients in whom cancer or JORRP is suspected should be referred to an expert for diagnosis and management. For intraepithelial and squamous cell cancers, the same cytology and colposcopic techniques used in HIV-uninfected patients should be used in HIV-infected patients; cytology is a screening test for cervical cancer, but histology remains the gold standard for confirming CIN and invasive cancers; in sexually active individuals, the entire genitalia and anal canal should be carefully inspected, vaginal, vulvar, and anal cancers often can be palpated by digital examination, and diagnosis is by histology with recognition through visual inspection including colposcopy and high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) and biopsy to confirm diagnosis.

- delayed healing, defined as a lack of progress toward the closure of the wound and no decrease in wound size

- discoloration of granulation tissue (edematous granulation tissue or pale, dusky in color) as opposed to the red beefy color of healthy granulation tissue

- friable granulation tissue bleeding spontaneously or bleeding with little provocation

- pocketing at the base of the wound or recessed areas with an absence of granulation tissue

- foul odor (typically caused by Gram-negative organisms and usually associated with anaerobic organisms)

- wound breakdown characterized by increased size, loss of epithelium, bony exposure, and nonadherent granulation tissue (results from abnormal collagen formation caused by high bioburden)

- increased level of pain even in the absence of any discernible signs of inflammation (suggestive of wound infection).

### Low effectiveness of syndromic treatment services for curable sexually transmitted infections in rural South Africa [^117K4eX6]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

Syndromic sexually transmitted infection (STI) treatment remains a cost-saving HIV prevention intervention in many countries in Africa. We estimate the effectiveness of syndromic treatment for curable STIs in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, and the trend in STI prevalences before and after the introduction of syndromic treatment in 1995.

Methods

Data were available from various clinical studies, surveys of public and private health providers, the general population and women attending antenatal, family planning and child immunisation clinics in rural northern KwaZulu-Natal between 1987 and 2004. Overall effectiveness was defined as the estimated proportion of the annual number of symptomatic curable STI episodes cured by syndromic treatment based on separate estimates for six curable STI aetiologies by gender.

Results

Median overall effectiveness was 13.1% (95% CI 8.9 to 17.8%) of symptomatic curable STI episodes cured. Effectiveness increased to 25.0% (95% CI 17.3 to 33.8%), 47.6% (95% CI 44.5 to 50.8%) or 14.3% (95% CI 9.9 to 19.4%) if 100% treatment seeking, 100% correct treatment provision or 100% cure were assumed, respectively. Time-trends were difficult to assess formally but there was little evidence of decreasing STI prevalences. Including incurable but treatable herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 ulcers in the effectiveness calculation would halve the proportion of ulcers cured or correctly treated, but this reduction could be entirely countered by including episodic antiviral treatment in the national guidelines.

Conclusion

Overall effectiveness of syndromic treatment for curable STIs in rural KwaZulu-Natal remains low and there is little evidence of reduced curable STI prevalences. As syndromic treatment is likely to be a cost-saving HIV prevention intervention in South Africa, innovative strategies are urgently needed to increase rates of treatment seeking and correct treatment provision.

### Management of oral and genital herpes in the emergency department [^112PaVAG]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

The epidemiology of oral and genital herpes has dramatically changed over the past decade. Herpes simplex virus-1, traditionally associated with oral herpes, is now implicated in an increasing percentage of genital herpes cases. The possibility of "autoinoculation" (or self-infection) of anatomic sites other than that of the primary infection has been recognized. New methods of suppression therapy are being examined. These changes have led to a revision in the recommendations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This review discusses herpes infections of the oral and genital mucosa and the suggested approach to the infected patient who presents in the emergency department. Specific attention is given to the CDC's 2006 guidelines for the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases.

We analysed a cohort of heterosexual HIV- serodiscordant couples with the aim of evaluating the risk of transmission ascribed to unprotected orogenital intercourse. A total of 135 seronegative individuals (110 women and 25 men), whose only risk exposure to HIV was unprotected orogenital sex with their infected partner, registered 210 person-years of follow-up. After an estimated total of over 19,000 unprotected orogenital exposures with the infected partner not a single HIV seroconversion occurred.

Sexually transmitted disease (STD) preventive services for persons with HIV — background states that sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), also known as sexually transmitted infections (STIs), are infections transmitted through penile, vaginal, oral, or anal sexual contact, regardless of the presence of symptoms or signs, and defines STD preventive services for persons with HIV as assessment of behavioral and biological factors that may increase the risk of transmitting HIV or STD; sexual risk-reduction interventions; screening asymptomatic persons for STD pathogens; clinical evaluation (including physical examination and diagnostic testing of persons with STD signs or symptoms); treatment; and partner services; it further notes that STD preventive services are an essential component of HIV prevention because 1) the diagnosis of an STD is an objective biologic marker of unprotected sexual activity that may result in HIV transmission; 2) certain STDs may increase plasma HIV viral load and genital HIV shedding, which may increase the risk of sexual and perinatal HIV transmission; and 3) STD treatment may reduce STD-related morbidity and lower the risk of HIV transmission.

Monitoring of adverse events (including IRIS) for genital warts and intraepithelial disease states that monitoring for toxicity and recurrences is required during and after treatment; cryotherapy's major toxicity is local pain; surgical treatment toxicities include local pain, bleeding, and secondary infection; acid cauterization can cause local pain and irritation or ulceration of adjacent normal skin; infrared coagulation may lead to bleeding and abscess formation; scarring can occur with any modality; secondary infections are not uncommon if ulcerations occur and close post-treatment monitoring is warranted; treatment of CIN can cause pain, intraoperative and postoperative hemorrhage, infection, and cervical stenosis, and treatment of AIN can cause ulcerations, abscesses, fissures, and fistulas; an immune reconstitution-like syndrome with oral warts has been observed with decreased HIV RNA on cART, and some studies but not others report increased oral warts following cART initiation.

### Aphthous ulcers: a difficult clinical entity [^115ZbKvT]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2000). Low credibility.

Recurrent aphthous ulcers (RAU) are the most common oral ulcerative disease, affecting 10% to 20% of the population. There are 3 clinical subtypes-minor, major, and herpetiform. Minor aphthous ulcers are the most common subtype, representing 80% to 90% of all recurrent aphthous ulcers. Clinically, RAU present as extremely painful, shallow ulcerations with an erythematous halo on unattached oral mucosa. The primary differential diagnosis is oral herpes simplex. The etiology of RAU is unknown. Topical corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy.

Risk screening and risk-reduction interventions — evidence supporting the recommendations summarizes sources and the role of screening. Evidence included studies on male circumcision and risk of HIV acquisition published between 2000 and 2012 and a cost-effectiveness analysis with per-client cost estimates and intervention effects based on 5 effective interventions from the CDC compendium; the writing group also conducted a narrative PubMed review between 2010 and March 2014. Accurate information on behavioral and biologic risks is needed to identify the most appropriate risk-reduction interventions, but estimation is difficult because risk varies by sexual and drug-injection behaviors, antiretroviral therapy (ART) use and adherence, HIV viral load, concurrent sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), pregnancy, partners' HIV status, and other factors, and the results of risk screening may be inaccurate due to factors including poor recall, misunderstanding about risks, previous negative experiences with disclosing risk behaviors, fear of negative judgments or stigmatization, desire for social approval, concerns about legal consequences, doubts about confidentiality protections, and poor rapport with providers. Studies show that some persons diagnosed with an acute bacterial STD deny having unprotected sex, and conducting risk screening using a nonjudgmental approach that stresses confidentiality may encourage trust and elicit more honest responses.

Diagnostic Considerations

A definitive diagnosis of chancroid requires identifying H. ducreyi on special culture media that is not widely available from commercial sources; even when these media are used, sensitivity is < 80%. No FDA-cleared NAAT for H. ducreyi is available in the United States; however, such testing can be performed by clinical laboratories that have developed their own NAAT and have conducted CLIA verification studies on genital specimens.

The combination of one or more deep and painful genital ulcers and tender suppurative inguinal adenopathy indicates the chancroid diagnosis; inguinal lymphadenitis typically occurs in < 50% of cases. For both clinical and surveillance purposes, a probable diagnosis of chancroid can be made if all of the following four criteria are met: 1) the patient has one or more painful genital ulcers; 2) the clinical presentation, appearance of genital ulcers and, if present, regional lymphadenopathy are typical for chancroid; 3) the patient has no evidence of T. pallidum infection by darkfield examination or NAAT (i.e. ulcer exudate or serous fluid) or by serologic tests for syphilis performed at least 7–14 days after onset of ulcers; and 4) HSV-1 or HSV-2 NAAT or HSV culture performed on the ulcer exudate or fluid are negative.

Treatment

Successful antimicrobial treatment for chancroid cures the infection, resolves the clinical symptoms, and prevents transmission to others. In advanced cases, genital scarring and rectal or urogenital fistulas from suppurative buboes can result despite successful therapy.

Recommended Regimens for Chancroid
Azithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose
or
Ceftriaxone 250 mg IM in a single dose
or
Ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 3 days
or
Erythromycin base 500 mg orally 3 times/day for 7 days

Azithromycin and ceftriaxone offer the advantage of single-dose therapy. Worldwide, several isolates with intermediate resistance to either ciprofloxacin or erythromycin have been reported. However, because cultures are not routinely performed, and chancroid is uncommon, data are limited regarding prevalence of H. ducreyi antimicrobial resistance.

SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED PHARYNGEAL INFECTIONS

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), especially Neisseria gonorrhoeae, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of individuals presenting with pharyngitis and a history of orogenital sex or sexual abuse. Men who have sex with men (MSM) are at greatest risk for N. gonorrhoeae pharyngeal infections. In the US, MSM at CDC surveillance sites were estimated to have experienced a 375% increase in gonorrhea incidence from 2010 to 2018. Oropharyngeal N. gonorrhoeae infections less commonly cause symptoms or lead to significant morbidity, but the oropharynx is thought to play a major role in the development of N. gonorrhoeae antimicrobial resistance. Clinical signs and symptoms of pharyngeal gonorrhea include sore throat with an erythematous pharynx, bilateral tonsillar enlargement, a grayish-yellow exudate, and occasionally cervical lymphadenopathy, gingivitis, and glossitis. Diagnosis can be facilitated by culture on modified Thayer-Martin medium in conjunction with biochemical and/or mass spectrometry identification methods, or (as of the time of manuscript preparation) either of only 3 US Food and Drug Administration-approved nucleic acid amplification tests (Cepheid GeneXpert CT/NG, Roche Cobas CT/NG 6800/8800, or Hologic Aptima Combo 2). For individuals ≤ 14 years of age with a positive test result for N. gonorrhoeae and/or Chlamydia trachomatis, confirmatory testing should be performed using more than one identification modality to ensure test result accuracy. Such situations may signify recent and/or ongoing sexual assault or abuse of a minor and the need to enlist child protective services and local law enforcement.

Chlamydia trachomatis and Treponema pallidum should also be considered as potential sexually transmitted pharyngeal infections. In a recent study quantifying the incidence and duration of pharyngeal chlamydia among MSM, 1.4% were positive at the time of enrollment with a median duration of 6 weeks. Despite the low incidence and duration of pharyngeal chlamydia relative to other sexually transmitted infections, its contribution is still relatively underreported and warrants further consideration in MSM. T. pallidum, the agent of syphilis, can invade any organ in the body and it also facilitates the transmission of other STIs. Nongenital syphilitic manifestations have become more frequent due to an overall surge in sexually transmitted infections, and T. pallidum has been shown to cause oropharyngeal lesions. Clinicians should consider the sexual history of their patients and be aware of clinical symptoms of sexually transmitted oropharyngeal infections.

Candidiasis (mucocutaneous) — diagnosis: Oropharyngeal candidiasis is usually diagnosed clinically based on the characteristic appearance of lesions, and unlike oral hairy leukoplakia the white plaques can be scraped off the mucosa. If laboratory confirmation is required, scrapings can be examined microscopically for characteristic yeast or hyphal forms using a potassium hydroxide preparation, and cultures of clinical exudative material yield the species of Candida present.

### Human herpes simplex virus infections: epidemiology, pathogenesis, symptomatology, diagnosis, and management [^112TtTFx]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Eight of the more than 80 known herpesviruses are human pathogens. Human herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a contagious infection with a large reservoir in the general population. It has a potential for significant complications in the immunocompromised host. In addition, psychological distress caused by the negative stigma associated with genital herpes and visible facial lesions in those experiencing frequent outbreaks renders it a challenging clinical dilemma. This article reviews the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and diagnostic features of HSV infections, providing the clinician with an up-to-date understanding of the available management strategies for mucocutaneous HSV-induced disease.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Clinical manifestations of herpes simplex virus (HSV) in children — including those with HIV — are outlined: Up to one third of immunocompetent children may develop primary orolabial gingivostomatitis, and HSV viremia occurs in approximately one-third of patients with primary herpetic gingivostomatitis. HSV is a common cause of severe posterior pharyngitis in older children and adolescents. Children with advanced HIV infection may have primary infection with multiple lesions that are atypical in appearance and delayed in healing, and very rarely disseminated HSV with visceral involvement and generalized skin lesions occurs in individuals with HIV. Recurrent perioral or perinasal vesicles can occur intermittently in healthy children and children with HIV, but those with AIDS are at risk of frequent recurrences with severe ulcerative disease and symptoms similar to primary infection; children with HIV also may have prolonged HSV shedding after both primary and reactivation infection, and HSV esophagitis can occur in severely immunocompromised children.

### Corporoplasty using buccal mucosa graft in peyronie disease: is it a first choice? [^112zKZmD]. Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To assesses the surgical and functional efficacy of corporoplasty with buccal mucosa graft, patients and partner's satisfaction, and the low cost of this operation. Biocompatible tissues are frequently used during corporoplasty, but they are expensive and often do not match the thickness and elasticity of the tunica albuginea, leading to fibrosis and scar retraction. Buccal mucosa graft is not usually emphasized in many review articles and clinical studies are limited.

Methods

Thirty-two patients with stable disease and normal erections were included in this retrospective study. All patients underwent corporoplasty with plaque incision and buccal mucosa graft. Preoperative International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire and penile duplex ultrasonographies with measurement of curvature were conducted. At 6 and 12 months postoperatively, patients answered the IIEF and the Patient Global Impression of Improvement questionnaires. Patient and partner satisfaction were recorded at all subsequent visits.

Results

Thirty-two patients underwent corporoplasty between 2006 and 2013, and no major complications developed in any patient. After 1 year, curvature relapse was present in 1 patient (3.5%), and 1 patient had slight erectile dysfunction. IIEF values had significantly improved 1 year after surgery (P = 0.031). Patient satisfaction was 85% on the Patient Global Impression of Improvement questionnaire. Twenty-five of 28 partners were satisfied (90%). Data analysis confirmed the stability of the IIEF score in 16 patients after 2 years (mean IIEF score, 21.3).

Conclusion

Corporoplasty with buccal mucosa graft is easy to perform and represents a good treatment choice for most forms of Peyronie disease with curvature preventing penetration and sexual intercourse.
