---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a 64-year-old man with a left below-knee amputation who has right distal Achilles calcification on X-ray and leg pain, and how to evaluate and manage this as possible insertional Achilles tendinopathy versus other causes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical significance of calcification at the Achilles insertion and whether it explains pain. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis for posterior heel and leg pain in an older adult with altered biomechanics. Next, I will review the focused history and examination elements that distinguish insertional from midportion disease and screen for red flags. After that, I need to check the imaging strategy and when ultrasound or MRI adds value. Finally, I will outline a staged, evidence-based management plan, including load management, footwear, and escalation pathways, and I will consider special considerations due to the contralateral amputation and prosthetic gait.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity suggested by "calcified tendinosis of the right distal Achilles tendon". Calcification at the Achilles insertion is characteristic of insertional Achilles tendinopathy or enthesopathy, often with intratendinous calcification and sometimes spurring at the calcaneal insertion, and it is frequently associated with chronic posterior heel pain aggravated by shoes and relieved by open-back footwear, which fits the classic presentation described in foot and ankle guidelines and imaging reviews of insertional pathology [^113zxCdZ] [^1152DBPH].

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiology before I anchor on "tendinitis". The modern framework treats Achilles tendinopathy as a failed healing response rather than primary inflammation; pain mechanisms include neovascularization and neurovascular ingrowth, and calcification reflects degenerative enthesopathic change rather than acute inflammation, so I should avoid calling this "tendinitis" unless there is clear inflammatory evidence, and instead use "insertional Achilles tendinopathy" or "enthesopathy" to align with current terminology and pathophysiology [^115FTzjR] [^111oha4x] [^117B2L4K].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions that the calcification alone explains the pain; I need to check the differential for posterior heel and leg pain in this patient. Insertional Achilles tendinopathy, retrocalcaneal or subcutaneous bursitis, Haglund deformity, partial or complete rupture, sural nerve entrapment, os trigonum syndrome, plantaris tendinopathy, and referred pain from the lumbopelvic region are all plausible, and in older adults with altered gait mechanics, paratenon irritation and bursal inflammation are common pain generators even when calcification is present, so I should confirm localization and associated structures on exam rather than assume the calcification is the pain source [^115PETnR] [^113zxCdZ] [^115tseki].

> I will now examine the history elements that sharpen localization and mechanism. I need to ask about insidious versus acute onset, shoe-related aggravation, morning stiffness, swelling or a palpable bump at the insertion, and whether pain improves with barefoot or open-back shoes; I should also screen for systemic features such as psoriasis, inflammatory back pain, or fluoroquinolone exposure, and I must ask about vascular risk, neuropathy, and prosthetic fit changes that could alter load transfer and contribute to symptoms [^113zxCdZ] [^111mhS29] [^113cqN8w].

> Next, I should review the focused physical examination. Let me first confirm the exact pain location by palpation at the calcaneal insertion versus 2–6 cm proximal for midportion disease, look for a positive arc sign and perform the Royal London Hospital test to localize maximal tenderness, and assess for a Haglund prominence; I should also test plantarflexion strength and endurance, measure ankle dorsiflexion and subtalar range, and inspect footwear and prosthetic alignment for potential contributors to eccentric overload of the Achilles [^111V1mmS] [^115EjuLF] [^116xgBbS].

> But wait, what if the pain is not from the Achilles at all; I need to ensure I screen for mimics. Sural nerve irritation produces lateral ankle pain and paresthesias, posterior impingement or os trigonum pain is typically posterior and worse in forced plantarflexion, and plantaris-related pain can be medial-sided with normal-appearing Achilles on imaging; given the left BKA, altered sagittal plane mechanics and asymmetrical calf loading may predispose to eccentric overload and paratenon irritation on the right, so I should double-check gait and prosthetic alignment as part of the biomechanical assessment [^115PETnR] [^115tseki] [^113fTFAW].

> I should confirm the imaging strategy next. Radiographs are appropriate first-line for chronic ankle pain and can identify insertional spurring or calcification, but ultrasound is the preferred next step when tendon abnormality is suspected and radiographs are normal or when I need to distinguish bursitis, assess neovascularity, or evaluate plantaris involvement; MRI is reserved for diagnostic uncertainty, unexpected clinical evolution, or surgical planning, and calcification alone on X-ray does not establish pain causality, so I need to correlate imaging with clinical findings before deciding on invasive treatments [^115nSuLN] [^1114MaBh] [^1153LVnx].

> Let me think about staging and prognosis to guide expectations. Insertional Achilles tendinopathy tends to be more recalcitrant than midportion disease, and calcification signals advanced degenerative enthesopathic change; however, many patients improve with conservative care over 3–6 months, and surgery is typically reserved for refractory cases after a structured program, so I should set realistic timelines and monitor for plateau or deterioration before escalating [^113zxCdZ] [^111PxWkS].

> Now, I should outline first-line management while I verify that we are truly dealing with insertional disease. Load modification with heel lifts of about 8–12 mm, open-back or soft heel-counter footwear, activity reduction to pain-provocation thresholds, and cryotherapy can offload the insertion; a structured calf-strengthening and eccentric loading program remains foundational, but for insertional disease I need to avoid end-range dorsiflexion that compresses the insertion and instead emphasize isometrics and heavy, slow concentric-eccentric loading with protection of the insertion, ideally supervised by physical therapy [^113zxCdZ] [^115EjuLF] [^115B6XS4].

> Hold on, I should verify adjuncts and what to avoid. NSAIDs can be used short term for pain, but I need to avoid corticosteroid injections at the Achilles insertion due to rupture risk; iontophoresis may help in acute flares, and orthoses can be considered to correct malalignment or offload pressure points, but I should prioritize exercise-based loading as the core intervention and reassess at 6–12 weeks [^113zxCdZ] [^114L4RTu] [^117BVc84].

> If symptoms persist beyond 3–6 months despite optimized conservative care, I need to check for persistent mechanical drivers and reconsider the diagnosis. At that point, MRI can delineate the extent of insertional degeneration, bursal disease, or Haglund impingement to guide surgical planning; surgical options include debridement of diseased tendon, resection of Haglund prominence and enthesophytes, and repair with suture anchors, with some patients benefiting from targeted bursal excision even when bone pathology is present, so I should coordinate with foot and ankle surgery for individualized planning [^1114MaBh] [^1152DBPH] [^114W2W1e].

> I should double-check special considerations from the contralateral BKA. Prosthetic alignment, socket fit, and heel height differential can create asymmetrical ground reaction forces and altered Achilles loading on the intact limb; a prosthetics review to optimize alignment and footwear balance may reduce eccentric overload on the right Achilles, and calf strengthening on the intact side should be paired with core and proximal hip stability to mitigate compensatory patterns that perpetuate symptoms [^113fTFAW].

> Let me reconsider the key decision points to ensure nothing is missed. First, confirm the pain source at the insertion with palpation and provocative tests rather than attributing pain to calcification alone; second, use ultrasound selectively to clarify bursal disease, neovascularity, or plantaris involvement when management stalls; third, adhere to a 3–6 month conservative program focused on load management and protected eccentric loading before considering surgery; and fourth, address prosthetic and biomechanical contributors to prevent recurrence once symptoms improve [^111V1mmS] [^1153LVnx] [^113zxCdZ] [^116AKdQ9].

> In summary, the most likely diagnosis is insertional Achilles tendinopathy with calcific enthesopathic change, but I need to ensure the clinical picture matches that diagnosis and exclude mimics; management should be staged and conservative-first, with imaging escalation only if the course is atypical or surgery is contemplated, and with attention to prosthetic factors that may be driving abnormal loading on the right Achilles tendon [^113zxCdZ] [^1153LVnx] [^113fTFAW].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **insertional Achilles tendinopathy with calcification** [^113zxCdZ], given the patient's age, unilateral symptoms, and radiographic calcification at the Achilles insertion [^1152DBPH]. This condition is common in older adults and typically presents with **posterior heel pain** and stiffness, especially with activity or shoes. Management is **conservative** [^115EjuLF], with eccentric loading exercises, heel lifts, NSAIDs, and footwear modification [^113zxCdZ]; surgery is reserved for refractory cases [^114Nxov4]. Imaging with ultrasound or MRI is indicated if symptoms persist or if rupture is suspected [^1153LVnx] [^114ytQaf].

---

## Clinical significance of calcified tendinosis of the distal Achilles tendon

Calcified tendinosis at the Achilles insertion reflects **degenerative change with calcium deposition** [^111yEbK6], often from chronic overuse, microtrauma, or metabolic factors [^113cqN8w]. It is a hallmark of **insertional Achilles tendinopathy** [^113zxCdZ] and correlates with pain, stiffness, and impaired function, particularly in older adults [^114gnCaj].

---

## Clinical presentation and symptoms

Typical features of **insertional Achilles tendinopathy with calcification** include:

- **Posterior heel pain**: Localized at or just above the calcaneal insertion, worsened by activity and shoes [^1155xXt4].
- **Morning stiffness**: Common after inactivity [^113bCSb8].
- **Swelling**: Localized thickening or swelling at the insertion [^1155xXt4].
- **Tenderness**: Palpable tenderness and sometimes a bony prominence at the insertion [^113zxCdZ].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Imaging studies

- **Plain radiographs**: Identify calcification at the Achilles insertion; initial imaging for chronic ankle/heel pain [^115nSuLN].
- **Ultrasound**: Assesses tendon structure, calcifications, bursitis, and neovascularity; preferred first-line advanced imaging for tendinopathy [^1153LVnx].
- **MRI**: Reserved for persistent symptoms, surgical planning, or suspected partial/full-thickness tears [^1153LVnx] [^114M81Tk].

---

### Clinical examination

On examination, **palpation** reveals tenderness at the Achilles insertion [^115EjuLF], and the **arc sign** may show a thickened, nodular segment 2–6 cm proximal to the insertion [^115EjuLF]. The **Royal London Hospital test** pinches the tendon at rest to identify the symptomatic focus [^115EjuLF].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Other causes of posterior heel pain to consider include:

- **Retrocalcaneal bursitis**: Inflammation of the bursa between the Achilles and calcaneus [^1155xXt4].
- **Haglund's deformity**: Prominent calcaneal tuberosity irritating the Achilles [^1155xXt4].
- **Partial Achilles tear**: Acute or chronic partial rupture [^111r7g7H].
- **Sural nerve entrapment**: Lateral heel pain with paresthesia [^115PETnR].
- **Systemic inflammatory diseases**: e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis [^113cqN8w].

---

## Management strategies

### Conservative management (first-line)

- **Eccentric loading exercises**: Heavy, slow eccentric calf strengthening [^notfound] at least 3 times/week [^116wQrDt].
- **Heel lifts**: 8–12 mm to reduce tendon load at the insertion [^113zxCdZ].
- **NSAIDs**: Short course for pain and inflammation [^113zxCdZ].
- **Footwear modification**: Avoid tight heel counters; consider open-back shoes [^113zxCdZ].
- **Physical therapy**: Stretching, manual therapy, and biomechanical correction [^117BVc84].

---

### Surgical management (reserved for refractory cases)

Surgical options include **debridement of calcifications and degenerated tendon**, excision of Haglund's deformity when present, and reattachment of the Achilles tendon with suture anchors as needed [^1152DBPH]. Indications include failure of at least 3–6 months of conservative care and persistent, function-limiting pain [^111PxWkS].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Conservative care leads to **good outcomes** in most patients, though recovery may take 6–12 months [^notfound]. Recurrence is common without ongoing load management and eccentric training; structured rehabilitation reduces recurrence risk [^116AKdQ9].

---

## Impact of prosthetic limb use on Achilles tendon health

The left BKA likely alters gait, increasing mechanical load on the right Achilles and predisposing to tendinopathy [^notfound]. Prosthetic adjustments, gait training, and targeted strengthening can mitigate overload and symptoms [^116wQrDt].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

The patient's leg pain most likely reflects **insertional Achilles tendinopathy with calcification**. Management should be **conservative**, with eccentric loading, heel lifts, NSAIDs, and footwear changes; ultrasound or MRI is indicated if symptoms persist or rupture is suspected. Given the right-sided load from the left BKA, prosthetic and gait optimization are important to reduce recurrence.

### Achilles tendon ossification: pathology, imaging and aetiology [^113xjnBV]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2008). Low credibility.

Background

We report a patient with ossification of the Achilles tendon, presenting plain radiographs, ultrasound, power doppler, computed tomography and magnetic resonance findings. The majority of the tendon was ossified, and there was adjacent soft tissue oedema. The appearance of peritendinous oedema associated with ossification has not, to our knowledge, been reported in the literature, and could account for hindfoot pain in cases of tendon ossification.

Method

A review of 44 articles on aetiology, histology and imaging was performed.

Results

Trauma, either accidental or from surgery, rather than tendinopathy is the likely aetiological factor.

Conclusion

The Achilles tendon usually responds to an insult with the development of mature bone, not dystrophic calcification, with no evidence of inflammatory or degenerative changes.

### Calcific tendonitis of the tibialis posterior tendon at the navicular attachment [^114gnCaj]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Calcific tendinosis (tendonosis/tendonitis) is a condition which results from the deposition of calcium hydroxyapatite crystals in any tendon of the body. Calcific tendonitis usually presents with pain, which can be exacerbated by prolonged use of the affected tendon. We report a case of calcific tendinosis in the posterior tibialis tendon at the navicular insertion. The pathology is rare in the foot, and extremely rare in the tibialis posterior tendon, indeed there are only 2 reported in the published literature. This case report highlights the need to consider calcific tendinosis in the foot despite its rarity. If this diagnosis is considered early, appropriate investigations can then be requested and unnecessary biopsies, use of antibiotics and surgery can be avoided. We also discuss possible causes of calcific tendinosis in the tibialis posterior tendon, the role of imaging modalities and review treatment methods.

SYNOPSIS: Clinical practice guidelines for Achilles tendinopathy do not recommend imaging to inform diagnosis. However, there is considerable variation in how imaging is used, particularly in research and sports. Early imaging risks that people who see the images presume that what they "see" as pathology is the primary cause of pain; patients might end up receiving invasive treatments on the basis of the image when rehabilitation may suffice. On the other hand, imaging can help rule out Achilles tendinopathy and identify differential diagnoses. As more rehabilitation clinicians are direct access practitioners and take on expanded roles as primary health practitioners, ultrasound imaging might serve as a valuable point-of-care tool for diagnosis, identifying conditions that warrant referral and managing conditions like Achilles tendinopathy. We argue that the value of ultrasound imaging to diagnose tendinopathy outweighs the potential limitations. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2024;54(1):1–4.

The patient was a 35-year-old man who worked as a pipe fitter. He was referred to a physical therapist by an orthopaedic surgeon for a chief complaint of progressively worsening pain in the medial aspect of the right distal Achilles tendon and heel that began insidiously 12 months earlier, which was consistent with a diagnosis of insertional Achilles tendonitis. Prior radiographs revealed mild calcification at the insertion of the Achilles tendon. Despite physical therapist intervention for 8 weeks, the patient did not improve. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging revealed a large multiloculated ganglion cyst in the tarsal tunnel.

### Physiopathology of intratendinous calcific deposition [^111yEbK6]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The aetiopathogenesis of CT is still controversial, but it seems to be the results of an active cell-mediated process. We advocate use of the terms 'calcific tendinopathy' and 'insertional calcific tendinopathy' to differentiate conditions that seem to be caused by two different pathogenetic mechanisms. Better understanding of the pathogenesis is essential for development of effective treatment modalities and for the improvement of clinical outcomes.

### The diagnosis and treatment of heel pain: a clinical practice guideline-revision 2010 [^113zxCdZ]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2010). Medium credibility.

Posterior heel pain — Insertional Achilles tendonopathy/enthesopathy pathway identifies history, exam, imaging, and staged management as follows: Significant history includes chronic posterior heel pain with insidious onset, symptoms aggravated by shoes, and symptoms relieved with barefoot or backless shoe. Significant findings include tenderness at Achilles insertion with ± central subcutaneous bony prominence and ± local inflammation. Radiographs show erosion or proliferative spurring at Achilles insertion and intratendinous calcification adjacent to insertion. Initial treatment options list patient-directed treatment options (heel lifts, open-back shoes, cryotherapy/topical analgesics, limit activities) plus oral antiinflammatories, orthoses, physical therapy, and weight loss. If improvement is unsatisfactory, immobilization with cast or CAM walker and continuation of initial treatment options are directed; persistent unsatisfactory improvement proceeds to surgery with resection of insertional spurring and tendon debridement. Satisfactory improvement at any step directs to continue therapy until symptoms resolve, and clinicians are prompted to consider alternative etiologies (Pathway 4).

### Achilles pain, stiffness, and muscle power deficits: achilles tendinitis [^115FTzjR]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2010). Medium credibility.

Achilles tendinopathy — terminology and anatomical focus — states that the terms "tendinitis" or "tendinosis" may be misleading and "should be replaced with 'tendinopathy', unless histological evidence has proven otherwise", and that terminology "should be tissue specific". Achilles tendinopathy is "frequently described at 2 anatomical locations: (1) midportion (2–6 cm proximal to the insertion) of the tendon and (2) calcaneal insertion", with midportion cases "the most common", and therefore "disorders of the midportion of the tendon described as 'Achilles tendinopathy' will be the focus of this clinical guideline unless otherwise stated".

### A treatment algorithm for managing achilles tendinopathy: new treatment options [^114Nxov4]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Achilles tendinopathy affects athletes, recreational exercisers and even inactive people. The pathology is not inflammatory; it is a failed healing response. The source of pain in tendinopathy could be related to the neurovascular ingrowth seen in the tendon's response to injury. The treatment of Achilles tendinopathy is primarily conservative with an array of effective treatment options now available to the primary care practitioner. If conservative treatment is not successful, then surgery relieves pain in the majority of cases. Directing a patient through the algorithm presented here will maximise positive treatment outcomes.

Achilles tendinopathy is prevalent and potentially incapacitating in athletes involved in running sports. It is a degenerative, not an inflammatory, condition. Most patients respond to conservative measures if the condition is recognised early. Surgery usually involves removal of adhesions and degenerated areas and decompression of the tendon by tenotomy or measures that influence the local circulation.

### Common conditions of the achilles tendon [^1178ewpf]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

The Achilles tendon, the largest tendon in the body, is vulnerable to injury because of its limited blood supply and the combination of forces to which it is subjected. Aging and increased activity (particularly velocity sports) increase the chance of injury to the Achilles tendon. Although conditions of the Achilles tendon are occurring with increasing frequency because the aging U.S. population is remaining active, the diagnosis is missed in about one fourth of cases. Injury onset can be gradual or sudden, and the course of healing is often lengthy. A thorough history and specific physical examination are essential to make the appropriate diagnosis and facilitate a specific treatment plan. The mainstay of treatment for tendonitis, peritendonitis, tendinosis, and retrocalcaneobursitis is ice, rest, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, but physical therapy, orthoties, and surgery may be necessary in recalcitrant cases. In patients with tendon rupture, casting or surgery is required. Appropriate treatment often leads to full recovery.

Achilles tendinopathy imaging — imaging is not required to diagnose Achilles tendinopathy but is recommended when the diagnosis is uncertain, there is a delayed response to care, or when invasive treatments are being considered; increased tendon thickness is common (present in 73% of individuals with Achilles tendinopathy) yet not specific because up to a quarter of asymptomatic adults have increased Achilles tendon thickness. Ultrasound, including B-mode, Doppler, and elastography, is the recommended imaging method by the Dutch multidisciplinary guideline, while for ankle pain in general radiographs are the first-line imaging method according to the American College of Radiology; if radiographs are normal and tendon abnormality is suspected, American College of Radiology guidelines recommend ultrasound or MRI without IV contrast, and MRI is commonly reserved for specific situations such as surgical planning. The 2024 summary states that imaging, in the form of ultrasound and radiographs, or MRI, is recommended when there is uncertainty in the diagnosis, if there is a delayed recovery, if there is negative change in symptoms over the course of care, or if a procedure is being considered.

### Not all tendons are created equal: implications for differing treatment approaches [^116Hbv9V]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

The majority of muscles have distinct tendinous attachments to bones; however, only a few tendons develop painful conditions. That simple observation prompts us to ask a few questions. Are there commonalities in morphology and pathology among the painful tendons? What contributes to the propensity for pathology in some, but not all, tendons? And, consequently, should all tendinopathies be managed equally? Two common tendinopathies are those affecting the Achilles and supraspinatus, which are presented in this special issue and serve as excellent models to discuss similarities and contrasts.

### The diagnosis and treatment of heel pain: a clinical practice guideline-revision 2010 [^1155xXt4]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2010). Medium credibility.

Posterior heel pain (Pathway 3) — etiology, presentation, and imaging highlight Achilles insertional pathology and retrocalcaneal bursitis. The posterior heel is the second most common location of mechanically induced heel pain, and pathology in this area is categorized as (1) Achilles insertional tendinopathy or enthesopathy, and (2) Haglund's deformity with or without retrocalcaneal bursitis. Achilles enthesopathy most commonly presents with an insidious onset and frequently leads to chronic posterior heel pain and swelling. Pain is aggravated by increased activity (eg, walking, running) and increased pressure caused by the shoe's heel counter. A palpable prominence may be appreciated both medially and laterally to the insertion of the Achilles tendon. Other proximal pathologies of the Achilles tendon must be ruled out. Achilles-related tendinopathy and rupture have also been related to fluoroquinolone use. Radiographic findings commonly show insertional proliferative spurring and/or erosion or intra-tendinous calcifications.

### Achilles tendon disorders in athletes [^113dKrpe]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Achilles tendon disorders are among the more common maladies seen by sports medicine physicians. Understanding the anatomy and biomechanics of the Achilles tendon and contiguous structures is essential to the diagnosis and treatment of Achilles tendon overuse injuries. Posterior heel pain is multifactorial and includes paratenonitis, tendinosis, tendinosis with partial rupture, insertional tendinitis, retrocalcaneal bursitis, and subcutaneous tendo-Achilles bursitis. Each of these entities is distinct, but they often occur in combination. Although most cases of this disorder are successfully treated nonoperatively, a small subgroup of recalcitrant cases may benefit from surgical intervention. Complete ruptures in active, athletic persons should be treated operatively in most cases and result in predictably good outcomes. There may be some cases that escape early recognition and require a reconstructive procedure to salvage a potentially severe functional deficit.

Achilles tendon pathology is common and affects athletes and nonathletes alike. The cause is multifactorial and controversial, involving biological, anatomical, and mechanical factors. A variety of conditions characterized by Achilles tendon inflammation and/or degeneration can be clinically and histologically differentiated. These include insertional Achilles tendinopathy, retrocalcaneal bursitis, Achilles paratenonitis, Achilles tendinosis, and Achilles paratenonitis with tendinosis. The mainstay of treatment for all of these diagnoses is nonoperative. There is a large body of evidence addressing treatment of acute and chronic Achilles tendon ruptures; however, controversy remains.

We present a case report with 1-year follow-up data of a 57-year-old male soccer referee who had sustained an acute triple Achilles tendon rupture injury during a game. His triple Achilles tendon rupture consisted of a rupture of the proximal watershed region, a rupture of the main body (mid-watershed area), and an avulsion-type rupture of insertional calcific tendinosis. The patient was treated surgically with primary repair of the tendon, including tenodesis with anchors. Postoperative treatment included non-weightbearing for 4 weeks and protected weightbearing until 10 weeks postoperative, followed by formal physical therapy, which incorporated an "antigravity" treadmill. The patient was able to return to full activity after 26 weeks, including running and refereeing, without limitations.

An Asian man presented to the Foot and Ankle Clinic with a 5-month history of right ankle pain of gradual onset. He had a non-fluctuant swelling around the Achilles tendon insertion with a tender palpable lump. Radiograph demonstrated Haglund's deformity and also possible calcification at the attachment of the Achilles tendon for which he had an injection of a local anaesthetic and a steroid to treat the insertional Achilles tendinitis. A few months later, he developed acute anorexia, abdominal distension secondary to ascites and groin lymphadenopathy. Histology of the lymph node biopsy revealed granulomatous lymphadenitis consistent with tuberculosis (TB) and started on quadruple agent anti-TB treatment. The sample was not cultured. He developed constant ooze from his groin lymph node biopsy site and also fluctuance around the Achilles tendon and heel. Pus from the heel stained positive for auramine indicating TB calcaneum with subsequent culture for acid fast bacilli (AFB) confirming diagnosis of TB calcaneum.

### Diagnosing achilles tendinopathy is like delicious spaghetti carbonara: it is all about key ingredients, but not all chefs use the same recipe [^112foMep]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Is a pathological tendon a vital ingredient to diagnose Achilles tendinopathy?

A recipe where the patient has localised Achilles tenderness and a normal imaging appearance is another challenging case. Is that Achilles tendinopathy? Cook and Purdam's proposed continuum model of pathology proposes a potential sequence of changes. Increased tendon cell proliferation and glycosaminoglycans with well-arranged tendon fibres are the features of early reactive tendinopathy. These findings cannot be detected using conventional ultrasound or MRI. While the presence of pathological changes in that situation cannot be confirmed with current method, that phenomenon (localised tenderness with 'normal' imaging) may be a subcategory of Achilles tendinopathy (early stage tendinopathy — preimaging). This opens the discussion whether we should consider tendinopathy as a clinical entity (like patellofemoral pain) or as a continuum with specific progressive pathology (like osteoarthritis, which uses the Kellgren and Lawrence Scale to classify the radiological severity of the disease). Should we distinguish different subclassifications of Achilles tendinopathy?

### Mid-portion achilles tendinopathy: why painful? An evidence-based philosophy [^114KQPK2]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Clinical presentation

Symptoms of a patient with mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy include painful swelling typically 2–7 cm proximal to the insertion and stiffness especially when getting up after a period of rest. Pain is the main symptom in Achilles tendinopathy that leads a patient to seek medical help. It is often most prominent 2–7 cm from the insertion onto the calcaneus on the medial side. Tendinopathy and paratendinopathy often coexist. Intratendinous changes most often remain asymptomatic. In these cases, a painless swelling at 2–7 cm proximal to the insertion is the only finding. In isolated paratendinopathy, there is local thickening of the paratenon. The area of swelling does not move with dorsiflexion and plantarflexion of the ankle, where it does in isolated tendinopathy. Paratendinopathy can be acute or chronic. Acute isolated paratendinopathy manifests itself as painful peritendinous crepitus as the tendon glides within the inflamed covering. Areas of increased erythema, local heat and asymptomatic palpable tendon nodules or defects may also be present at clinical examination. In chronic paratendinopathy, exercise-induced pain is the main symptom while crepitation and swelling diminish.

### Leg length discrepancy: the importance of a complete history and examination [^114XoDF3]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A 26-year-old woman with a 1-year history of right knee pain had failed to respond to analgesia and activity modification in the community. Her general practitioner referred her to the orthopaedic department for specialist review. A thorough history revealed that she had multiple orthopaedic interventions as a child. The patient had significant postoperative infection of the left knee following knee surgery at 7 years of age. Examination demonstrated the presence of a limp, scoliosis and suspected leg length discrepancy. Plain film radiography confirmed the presence of leg length discrepancy, with the right limb measuring 30 mm longer than the left. The leg length discrepancy was likely secondary to a growth arrest of the left knee following the postoperative infection in childhood. The patient was managed with physiotherapy and heel raises and received regular orthopaedic follow-up.

Achilles tendinopathy — prognosis and management indicates that the long-term prognosis for acute-to-subchronic cases is favorable with nonoperative treatment, with significant decreases in pain and improved function after 6 to 12 weeks of intervention, and long-term follow-up ranging between 2 and 8 years suggesting that between 71% to 100% of patients can return to prior activity levels with minimal or no complaints. Conservative therapy is initially recommended, and when conservative treatment fails, surgery is recommended to remove fibrotic adhesions and degenerative nodules to restore vascularity. In an 8-year follow-up study, 29% of those with acute to subacute Achilles tendinopathy required surgical intervention, and retrospective studies report surgical rates for those failing conservative treatment ranging from 24% to 49%. Those who responded to nonoperative therapy tended to be younger (average age, 33 years) than those requiring surgery (average age, 48 years), and Four to 6 months of conservative intervention is recommended for those with Achilles tendinopathy.

Certainty of evidence

We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) for NMAs to appraise the certainty of evidence. Evidence from each comparison was appraised for direct and indirect comparisons, and for the combined evidence, where applicable. Evidence could be of 'high certainty', 'moderate certainty', 'low certainty' or 'very low certainty'. All ratings started at the level of 'high certainty'. Two authors (ACV and MW) independently rated the evidence down on the basis of risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision and publication bias. Inconsistency in GRADE involves heterogeneity across trials and is not related to inconsistency in the network. We rated the overall body of evidence in the network to indicate the strength of the NMA recommendations.

### Terminology for achilles tendon related disorders [^1144y66k]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Proposed terminology for Achilles tendon related disorders

Examining the evolution of the terminology over the years, the efforts and the struggle are obvious. Some terms represent a disease, some an anatomic location, a pathology, or a generic name. The reasoning behind a change in terminology is unclear; it appears to be largely susceptible to fashion. In the 19th century, the terminology was mainly based on anatomy; later, it was based on histopathology; others have proposed a 'history'-based terminology.

Five leading anatomy journals were contacted, and asked for information on which terminology they demanded from their authors. Based on the answers, it can be concluded that, concerning anatomy, there is no such thing as a "standard terminology". Some stated that the authors were expected to use "widely accepted terminology".

The definitions for Achilles tendon disorders should comprise anatomic location, symptoms, clinical findings, and histopathology. The term to represent the entity must be neutral yet descriptive, uniform and clear. The aforementioned lack of consistency should be avoided as much as possible. The following definitions are therefore proposed (Table 1).

Table 1
Terminology for Achilles tendon related disorders, including the anatomic location, symptoms, clinical findings histopathology

For radiographic findings see Table 2

Table 2
Radiologic findings in Achilles tendon disorders

Mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy

Achilles tendinopathy is a clinical syndrome characterized by a combination of pain, swelling and impaired performance. The swelling can be diffuse or localized. Typically, the nodular swelling is located at 2–7 cm from the insertion onto the calcaneus. This part of the tendon has also been described as the "main body of the Achilles tendon". This entity involves isolated pathology of the tendon proper, and includes, but is not limited to, the histopathological diagnosis of tendinosis.

Tendinosis implies histopathological diagnosis of tendon degeneration without clinical or histological signs of intratendinous inflammation, and is not necessarily symptomatic. However, it should be kept in mind that, although the histological term 'tendinosis' is also widely used, the essential lesion of tendinopathy is not, strictu sensu, of a degenerative nature: it has the features of a failed healing response, in which the tendon attempts to heal, but, for some reason, including, possibly, continuous inappropriate mechanical stimuli, the healing process appears non-finalised.

Module 1 risk factors and primary prevention of Achilles tendinopathy

Scoping question

Which individuals are at increased risk of developing Achilles tendinopathy and how can this be prevented?

This scoping question includes the following two subquestions

Which modifiable and non-modifiable factors increase the risk of Achilles tendinopathy?
Which primary prevention strategy is most effective for Achilles tendinopathy?

Introduction

Problem

The onset of Achilles tendinopathy is generally related to ageing and overuse. In addition, biomechanical factors, genetic factors, specific health problems, medication use and imaging abnormalities are thought to be associated with the onset of Achilles tendinopathy. There is currently insufficient knowledge about modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for the onset of Achilles tendinopathy. This is important because it can inform (preventive) interventions.

Primary prevention aims to prevent an initial disease episode, and this is an important topic especially in sports. By applying primary prevention in specific populations at high risk of Achilles tendinopathy, both the incidence and long-term symptoms may be reduced.

There is insufficient knowledge about the effectiveness of primary prevention strategies for Achilles tendinopathy. The literature search, selection, conclusions, considerations and summary with tables and/or figures are presented in online supplemental file module 1.

Recommendations

Midportion and insertional Achilles tendinopathy

Consider informing individuals with a history of lower limb tendinopathy who are going to become active or increase their training load about the increased risk of Achilles tendinopathy.

A gradual training build-up, taking into account the type, frequency, size and intensity of the training.
Targeted calf muscle strengthening exercises prior to the sports season, in which the exercise dosage should be tailored to the individual.
Wearing enough warm clothing during training in the winter.

In the context of the importance of preventing Achilles tendinopathy, consider advising individuals to avoid the use of fluoroquinolone antibiotics if alternative antibiotics are available and the clinical picture allows.

### Tendon injury and tendinopathy: healing and repair [^117B2L4K]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2005). Low credibility.

Tendon disorders are frequent and are responsible for substantial morbidity both in sports and in the workplace. Tendinopathy, as opposed to tendinitis or tendinosis, is the best generic descriptive term for the clinical conditions in and around tendons arising from overuse. Tendinopathy is a difficult problem requiring lengthy management, and patients often respond poorly to treatment. Preexisting degeneration has been implicated as a risk factor for acute tendon rupture. Several physical modalities have been developed to treat tendinopathy. There is limited and mixed high-level evidence to support the, albeit common, clinical use of these modalities.

### Ultrasound and surgical inspection of plantaris tendon involvement in chronic painful insertional achilles tendinopathy: a case series [^115tseki]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Insertional Achilles tendinopathy is known to be difficult to treat as multiple different tissues can be involved in the pathogenesis. The subcutaneous and retrocalcaneal bursae, the bone insertion and the distal Achilles tendon, can alone or in combination be responsible for pain. This can make the diagnosis challenging, likely affecting the outcome of treatment. There is paucity of evidence-based treatment for this condition which makes it difficult to support currently used treatment recommendations. Further studies on pain mechanisms and randomised studies comparing treatment approaches are warranted to develop effective pathology-based treatment methods.

Recently, coexisting plantaris tendinopathy has been demonstrated in a subgroup of patients suffering from chronic painful mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy not responding to conservative treatments. Anatomical observations have shown that between individuals, there is a large variation in the course and insertion site of the plantaris tendon. The position of the plantaris in relation to the Achilles is of importance and can during certain movements lead to interference with compression and shearing between the Achilles and plantaris tendons. Surgical removal of the plantaris tendon has shown good short-term and longer-term clinical results, and also improved Achilles tendon structure. Furthermore, there is evidence that in some cases, only the plantaris tendon is abnormal suggesting that the plantaris tendon itself can be a driver of medial Achilles tendon pain. Therefore, a proper diagnosis including evaluation of plantaris tendon involvement is essential for choosing the correct treatment. Studies comparing clinical, surgical and imaging findings in patients with mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy have shown that plantaris tendon involvement is mostly characterised by medial tenderness, localised high blood flow between the plantaris and Achilles, and tendinopathic structural changes in the medial side of the Achilles.

### Current concepts in imaging of tendinopathy [^1115zQm2]. Clinical Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

With the rising popularity of recreational sports, radiologists are being asked to image tendons with increasing frequency. Recognition of the critical link tendons provide between muscle and bone has also led to a better understanding of the processes leading to tendon damage. While plain radiography and CT have only a limited role to play in the diagnosis of tendon abnormality, the improvements in ultrasound and MRI technology mean that tendons can now be demonstrated in exquisite detail and previously undetectable abnormalities are readily demonstrated. This article reviews the structure and pathological processes affecting tendons and discusses the role of imaging in their assessment with an emphasis on ultrasound and MRI.

### Acute tear of the fascia cruris at the attachment to the achilles tendon: a new diagnosis [^116D6fKY]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The literature describing the fascia cruris is limited to its functional anatomy and its surgical release in the treatment of chronic paratenonitis. Injury to this structure has not been considered previously. Tears of the fascia cruris have been observed on ultrasound and are clinically relevant to diagnosing Achilles pain accurately. Whether it has implications for the development of other Achilles tendon pathology is as yet unknown but warrants further investigation, as are prospective studies to clarify the incidence and confirm the aetiology and the optimum treatment regime. Acute tears of the fascia cruris need to be considered as a cause of Achillodynia with a sudden onset of pain in the active individual. The condition provides a differential diagnosis to paratenonitis.

What are the new findings?

Tears of the fascia cruris can occur at the attachment to the Achilles tendon and the paratenon.
The history is usually of acute onset Achillodynia with pain, swelling and tenderness along the medial or lateral border of the tendon in the mid-portion.
Diagnosis is made using diagnostic ultrasound. Tilting the probe may be required to visualise the fascia cruris attachment to the paratenon.

How might it impact on clinical practice in the near future?

Recognition of a new pathological diagnosis in acute onset Achillodynia.
Differential diagnosis to paratenonitis but different mechanism and imaging appearances.

No additional imaging studies are needed if the presenting case fits all four diagnostic criteria.

Consider additional imaging examinations (X-ray of the calcaneus, ultrasound of the Achilles tendon or MRI of the ankle) if:

The symptoms do not fit with all four diagnostic criteria.
The symptoms match all four diagnostic criteria, but there is an unexpected course or change of symptoms during follow-up.
Surgery is being considered.

Consider a referral to a sports medicine physician or an orthopaedic surgeon if:

There is continued uncertainty about the diagnosis.
There is an unexpected course or change of symptoms during follow-up.

Consider a referral to a rheumatologist if:

There is insertional Achilles tendinopathy or an established diagnosis of spondylarthritis or a suspicion of this condition (chronic low back pain that started before the age of 45 or psoriasis).

Consider a referral to a general medical consultant if:

There is midportion Achilles tendinopathy and a demonstrated familial hypercholesterolaemia or suspicion of this condition (an untreated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol value higher than 5.0mmol/L or an untreated total cholesterol value higher than 8.0mmol/L, a first degree relative with cardiovascular disease before the age of 60, a first-degree relative with an untreated total cholesterol level higher than 8.0mmol/L (approximately equivalent to an LDL cholesterol level higher than 5.0 mmol/l mmol/L), presence of cardiovascular disease under the age of 60 and/or the presence of an arcus lipoides under the age of 45.

Module 6 preventing recurrence of Achilles tendinopathy

Scoping question

How can recurrent symptoms be prevented in patients who have recovered from Achilles tendinopathy?

The scoping question includes the following subquestion

Which prevention strategies are effective in patients who have recovered from Achilles tendinopathy?

Introduction

Problem

After recovery from Achilles tendinopathy it is important to prevent recurrence. As a previous lower limb tendinopathy is the risk factor with the strongest evidence for developing Achilles tendinopathy, there is a likelihood of recurring symptoms. There is insufficient knowledge about the effectiveness of prevention strategies aimed at recurrent Achilles tendinopathy. The literature search, selection, conclusions, considerations and summary with tables and/or figures are presented in online supplemental file module 6.

Recommendations

Midportion and insertional Achilles tendinopathy

Discuss that sufficient time should be spent on active treatment before starting with provocative (sports) loading.

As a rule, a return to full symptom-free (sports) loading is only possible after a few months of active treatment at a minimum. A return to sports within days is associated with a greater likelihood of recurrence. Discuss the speed of return to sports with the patient and take the above-mentioned data into account.

Ensure a gradual build-up of the (sports) loading after recovery from Achilles tendinopathy or after a longer period of relative inactivity.

Consider continuing exercise therapy of the calf muscles after symptomatic recovery from Achilles tendinopathy.

Achilles tendinopathy — dorsiflexion range of motion as an intrinsic risk factor: Abnormal dorsiflexion range of motion, either decreased or increased, has been associated with a higher incidence or risk of Achilles tendinopathy. In a 2-year prospective study, less than 11.5° of dorsiflexion (knee extended) increased the risk of developing Achilles tendinopathy by a factor of 3.5 versus those with 11.5° to 15° of dorsiflexion. In a group of 69 military recruits, increased dorsiflexion range of motion (> 9°) was identified as a heightened risk factor, though the level of increased risk was low and added little to a logistic regression analysis predicting occurrence.

### Current clinical concepts: conservative management of achilles tendinopathy [^115EjuLF]. Journal of Athletic Training (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for achilles tendinopathy, more specifically with respect to history and physical examination, AT-EG 2020 guidelines recommend to perform a physical examination to elicit the following:

- pain on palpation of the tendon and the subjective report of pain in the midportion (2–6 cm above the calcaneal insertion) for diagnosing midportion Achilles tendinopathy

- location of pain on palpation for distinguishing between an insertional or midportion injury and for the differential diagnosis; greater pain on palpation anterior to the tendon than in the tendon itself is suggestive of posterior ankle impingement or os trigonum syndrome; posterior ankle pain differential diagnosis also includes acute Achilles tendon rupture, accessory soleus muscle, sural nerve irritation, fat-pad irritation, and systemic inflammatory disease

- the arc sign - palpation of tendon identifying thickened nodules - for confirming midportion Achilles tendinopathy

- the Royal London Hospital test - pinching the tendon to identify the most symptomatic location with the foot at rest - for confirming midportion Achilles tendinopathy.

### Achilles tendon problems: not just an orthopaedic issue [^112Udtm2]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

To review the current concepts on Achilles tendon involvement in various pathological conditions.

Method

A literature search was conducted to trace relevant literature on Achilles tendon problems in general pathologies.

Results

The Achilles tendon can be involved in inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, genetically determined collagen abnormalities, infectious diseases, tumours, and neurological conditions which are not of a primary surgical nature.

Conclusions

Although Achilles tendon problems are classically considered frequent in active individuals from overuse or a single acute episode, problems in the Achilles tendon can be a consequence of several conditions.

### Point-of-care ultrasound diagnosis of acute achilles tendon rupture in the ED [^114ytQaf]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with acute Achilles tendon injuries from sport related activities are frequently seen in the emergency department (ED). Missed or delayed diagnosis of an Achilles tendon rupture can result in significant patient morbidity. However, the diagnosis of an Achilles tendon rupture is not always clear clinically. Physical examination maneuvers to assess for a tendon injury can be limited by pain and soft tissue swelling. Ultrasound has been shown to be very sensitive in detecting an Achilles tendon rupture. We report a case of a 39-year-old woman who presented to the ED with severe left ankle and leg pain. Her physical examination was limited by pain. However, a point-of-care ultrasound examination helped in making a prompt and accurate diagnosis of acute Achilles tendon rupture. This case demonstrates that point-of-care ultrasound can be a useful diagnostic tool in the assessment of patients with suspected Achilles tendon rupture, particularly when the physical examination is limited.

### Tendinopathies of the foot and ankle… [^117BVc84]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

PERONEAL TENDON Persistent lateral ankle swelling, popping, and retro-fibular pain often occur after this type of injury. A subjective feeling of ankle instability is common. A positive peroneal tunnel compression test is pain with active dorsiflexion and eversion of the foot against resistance along the posterior ridge of the fibula. If degeneration of the tendon has occurred, a thickened, nodular area will be palpable. Results of the Thompson test are normal in patients with tendinitis or tendinosis. 50 A complete rupture of the Achilles tendon should be suspected if there is a history of acute pain after a pop in the posterior aspect of the heel, and a gap can be palpated within the Achilles tendon with a positive result on the Thompson test. Differential diagnosis includes retrocalcaneal bursitis and inflammation of the superficial bursa of the Achilles tendon.

8, 14–16 Physical therapy modalities including ultrasound treatments, ionto- and phonophoresis, firm heel lift, and gastrocnemius-soleus complex-soleus stretching have been helpful. 14, 16 Steroid injections should be limited to the retrocalcaneal bursa; however, there is growing evidence that the use of steroids around the Achilles tendon increases the risk of rupture. 51, 52. 53, 54 Chronic tendinopathy of the FHL leads to chronic pain, early arthritis, and fibrosis with decreased range of motion.
53. Patients with FHL injury describe an insidious onset of pain along the posteromedial aspect of the ankle behind the malleolus or the medial aspect of the subtalar joint. When the foot is placed in plantar flexion and the patient is asked to flex the great toe against resistance, there is pain or crepitus along the FHL. A mass in the anterior leg may be seen or palpated by the physician, especially with dorsiflexion.

Patients usually report a transient twinge of pain in the anterior ankle with no swelling or discoloration. Ultimately, a painless, flat-footed, slapping gait may occur. Complete rupture of this tendon most commonly affects patients in their 50s and 60s and should be differentiated from lumbar radiculopathy, peroneal nerve palsy, and complications of diabetes or syphilis.
