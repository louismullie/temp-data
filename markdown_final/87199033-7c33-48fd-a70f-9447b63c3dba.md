## Question

Do hsv 1 IgG and hsv 2 IgG tests confirm a herpes diagnosis? Could you still have herpes if the results are non reactive?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking if type‑specific HSV‑1/2 IgG tests confirm a herpes diagnosis and whether someone could still have herpes if the results are non reactive. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what HSV IgG assays actually measure and the timing of seroconversion. Then, I should review assay performance and the impact of low‑positive index values on false positives. Next, I will determine when a positive IgG does and does not confirm genital herpes, including the role of confirmatory Western blot. After that, I should consider scenarios where IgG is negative despite true infection and outline appropriate follow‑up testing. Finally, I need to align this with current guidelines on when to order serology versus PCR and when to avoid screening altogether, especially in asymptomatic patients.

> Let me first confirm what these tests detect and what a positive result means. Type‑specific HSV serologies are IgG assays directed at glycoprotein G antigens (gG1 for HSV‑1, gG2 for HSV‑2), so they measure prior immune exposure rather than current viral replication; they are not PCR or antigen tests and cannot by themselves localize infection to the mouth versus genitals or determine activity status, and that distinction is crucial for counseling and management [^112jtTBc] [^112fMEv8]. I should double‑check the timing: in most immunocompetent adults, IgG appears several weeks after acquisition; broadly, seroconversion begins around 3–6 weeks and may continue to mature through about 9–10 weeks, so very early after exposure IgG can still be negative despite true infection [^111vZqFQ] [^111w41PD].

> Now I need to examine how reliable a positive IgG is, and in particular, I should verify how index values influence accuracy. Wait, let me verify the assay differences: large comparative studies show that for HSV‑2 IgG, the Roche Elecsys tends to have the best sensitivity and specificity, with Bio‑Rad close behind, while the DiaSorin assay underperforms on both measures and is especially prone to false positives at low‑positive index ranges; for HSV‑1 IgG, all platforms trade sensitivity and specificity, and none is optimal [^113Yxmpo] [^111vZqFQ]. Hold on, I should not jump to conclusions about any single low‑positive result: across platforms, positive index values below roughly 3.0 have a markedly higher false‑positive rate, and this is most pronounced with DiaSorin where the majority of low‑positive HSV‑1 results and a substantial fraction of low‑positive HSV‑2 results are false; this is why low‑positive results require caution and confirmation [^115fShAF] [^113Yxmpo].

> Let me consider when a positive IgG can confirm a genital herpes diagnosis. In a patient with typical genital lesions or a compatible history, a clearly positive HSV‑2 IgG — particularly with a higher index — strongly supports genital HSV‑2 infection because HSV‑2 is usually sexually acquired and genital in tropism; however, confirmation with lesion PCR remains the diagnostic standard during active episodes and is more definitive than serology for site attribution and timing of infection [^112fMEv8]. Hmm, wait a minute — I almost implied the same for HSV‑1 IgG; I should correct that: a positive HSV‑1 IgG often reflects remote oral infection from childhood and does not by itself prove genital disease; clinical correlation and lesion PCR are needed to ascribe a genital HSV‑1 diagnosis confidently [^112fMEv8]. I need to ensure I include the confirmatory pathway: for low‑positive or discordant results, guidelines favor confirmatory testing with a second, more specific method — ideally a Western blot that surveys antibodies to multiple HSV proteins and functions as the serologic gold standard in U.S. reference testing, especially when clinical stakes are high [^112jtTBc] [^1124YUrG].

> I should confirm what to do when the IgG is negative but suspicion remains high. A nonreactive IgG does not exclude infection in the window period; repeating serology in 4–6 weeks is reasonable, with longer intervals if immunocompromised, recognizing that assay sensitivity is not perfect and a small proportion of true infections may remain seronegative on a given platform even after seroconversion [^111vZqFQ] [^113Yxmpo]. But wait, let me verify the most sensitive diagnostic step during symptoms: direct viral detection by PCR from active lesions is the preferred test to establish an active genital infection and to type the virus; in CNS disease, IDSA recommends CSF HSV PCR with repeat testing if the early result is negative but clinical suspicion persists; in disseminated or severe disease, serum or whole‑blood PCR can assist, with serum performing well in comparative studies of sample types [^112fMEv8] [^114QcaQD] [^112M8X8g] [^117KzeoJ]. I need to also consider host factors: in advanced HIV or other immunosuppressed states, serology may be delayed or blunted, so reliance on molecular diagnostics becomes even more important when clinical suspicion is high [^111kt5Ks].

> Next, I should review the guideline perspective to avoid overtesting and mislabeling. The AAFP and CDC‑aligned guidance support type‑specific serology in targeted diagnostic scenarios — such as recurrent or atypical lesions, negative lesion testing with persistent suspicion, or in people with HIV — while discouraging routine serologic screening of asymptomatic adolescents and adults because false positives are common and the net clinical benefit is low; a two‑step algorithm with a screening assay followed by a more specific confirmatory test is recommended when serology is pursued [^116D33iw] [^112jtTBc]. Let me not forget pregnancy nuances: in selected pregnant patients without a personal history but with an at‑risk partner, type‑specific serology can help risk‑stratify and guide counseling, with repeat testing late in gestation when indicated, but universal screening remains unsupported [^112KeUzV].

> Bottom line, I should synthesize this clearly. Type‑specific HSV‑1/2 IgG tests confirm prior exposure to that HSV type once seroconversion has occurred; they do not identify the anatomic site or prove current activity, and a positive HSV‑1 IgG often reflects remote oral infection, not necessarily genital disease; during active lesions, lesion PCR is the preferred diagnostic test to confirm genital herpes and assign type [^112fMEv8]. I should double‑check the caveats: low‑positive index values have a substantial false‑positive rate and should be confirmed with a second, more specific assay, ideally a Western blot; high‑titer HSV‑2 IgG in a patient with a compatible genital syndrome supports a diagnosis of genital HSV‑2, whereas HSV‑1 IgG requires more clinical and virologic correlation for genital attribution [^115fShAF] [^113Yxmpo] [^112jtTBc] [^1124YUrG]. If IgG is negative early after exposure or in an immunocompromised host, I should repeat serology after the window period and prioritize direct PCR from lesions or relevant specimens when disease is suspected, aligning all testing decisions with guideline‑endorsed, targeted use of serology rather than routine screening in asymptomatic individuals [^111vZqFQ] [^111kt5Ks] [^116D33iw] [^112jtTBc].

---

No, HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG tests do not confirm **active herpes infection**; they only indicate **past exposure** [^112fMEv8] [^112jtTBc]. Yes, you can have herpes with **non-reactive IgG results** if testing occurs during the **seronegative window** [^111w41PD] [^116Eueyv], in **immunocompromised states**, or due to **assay limitations** [^113Yxmpo] [^115fShAF]. For active infection, use PCR [^116D33iw] or culture from lesions, and confirm low-positive or discordant serology with a second assay or Western blot [^112jtTBc].

---

## Interpretation of HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG results

HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG tests detect type-specific antibodies to glycoprotein G (gG-1 for HSV-1, gG-2 for HSV-2), indicating **prior exposure** but **not active infection** [^112jtTBc]. IgG typically develops within **2–12 weeks** after exposure and persists for life [^111w41PD] [^112fMEv8].

| **Result** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|
| Positive | Prior exposure to HSV-1 or HSV-2; does not confirm active infection |
| Negative | No detectable antibodies; possible no exposure, early infection, or immunosuppression |
| Equivocal | Indeterminate; repeat testing or confirmatory testing recommended |

---

## Limitations and accuracy of HSV IgG testing

HSV IgG assays have **limitations**, including false positives and negatives, cross-reactivity, and variable performance across platforms [^113Yxmpo] [^112fMEv8].

- **False positives**: Cross-reactivity or nonspecific binding, especially at low index values [^115fShAF] [^1121gRzg].
- **False negatives**: Early testing before seroconversion or immunosuppression [^111w41PD] [^116aS4LE].
- **Assay variability**: Performance differs by platform; Roche HSV-2 IgG shows high sensitivity/specificity, while DiaSorin has more false positives [^113Yxmpo] [^111vZqFQ].

---

## Clinical scenarios with non-reactive IgG but active infection

Active herpes can occur with **non-reactive IgG** due to:

- **Early infection**: Testing before seroconversion (2–12 weeks) [^111w41PD] [^116Eueyv].
- **Immunosuppression**: Blunted antibody responses (e.g. HIV, chemotherapy).
- **Assay limitations**: False negatives from assay variability or low antibody levels [^116aS4LE] [^113Yxmpo].

---

## Confirmatory testing and clinical correlation

PCR or culture of active lesions is preferred for diagnosing active infection; **PCR is more sensitive** [^116D33iw]. Western blot is the **gold standard** for serologic confirmation, particularly for discordant or low-positive results [^112jtTBc]. Results should be interpreted in the **clinical context**, including symptoms, exposure, and risk factors [^116D33iw].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **targeted testing** with **confirmatory strategies**:

- **CDC guidelines**: Use a two-step algorithm (screening assay followed by confirmatory test) [^112jtTBc].
- **USPSTF**: Recommends against routine serologic screening in asymptomatic adults due to false positives and limited benefit [^112jtTBc] [^113Yxmpo].
- **AAFP guidelines**: Use type-specific serology when clinical suspicion is high or PCR/culture is negative [^116D33iw].

---

HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG tests indicate prior exposure but **do not confirm active infection**. Non-reactive results can occur in early infection, immunosuppression, or due to assay limitations. Confirm active infection with **PCR or culture**, and use confirmatory serology when needed.

### Clinical correlates of index values in the focus HerpeSelect ELISA for antibodies to herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) [^111w41PD]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2006). Low credibility.

Clinical correlates of HerpeSelect ELISA index values are poorly understood. This study was designed to determine the effects of time of infection, test variability, and antibody avidity on index values. Sera (N = 313) from 81 patients with new HSV-2 infections and 236 sera from 32 patients with long-standing (median 11.3 years) HSV-2 were tested by HerpeSelect HSV-2 ELISA. High positive, low positive, and negative controls were run on 42 test plates to establish test variability.

Index values tended to rise after infection, peaking a median of 9–10 weeks post-infection (range 8–323 days). Of 32 patients with established HSV-2 infections, 7 (22%) had at least one low index value (> 1.1 to ≤ 3.5), and one had a transient seroreversion event. Test variability of index values was substantially lower than inter- or intra-patient variability. Median antibody avidity was higher in sera with high versus low index values in established infections, but unrelated to index value in patients with early infections.

Index values or index value changes are not absolute indicators of early versus established HSV-2 infection or solely a function of test variability. Low antibody avidity may contribute to low index values once infection is established.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^111vZqFQ]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

No single assay performed best for both HSV-1 and HSV-2 in the clinical remnant cohort. The DiaSorin HSV-1 IgG assay had the highest sensitivity (94.8%) but the lowest specificity (90.4%), while both the Roche and Bio-Rad assays had lower sensitivities (85.9% and 87.1%, respectively) but higher specificities (98.7% and 98.2%, respectively). For measuring HSV-2 IgG, the Roche assay had the highest sensitivity (96.1%) and specificity (99.7%). The Bio-Rad HSV-2 IgG assay had a sensitivity of 91.9% and specificity of 98.8%, whereas the DiaSorin HSV-2 IgG assay was both the least sensitive (85.4%) and least specific (94.5%).

On initial testing, 19 results (1.0%; 8 HSV-1 and 11 HSV-2) were equivocal on the Bio-Rad assay, and 24 results (1.2%; 16 HSV-1 and 8 HSV-2) were equivocal on the DiaSorin assay. For the Bio-Rad assay, the majority of equivocal results — 88% for HSV-1 and 64% for HSV-2 — were revised to a non-equivocal final result, of which 57% of the revised results were concordant with WB. Only 12.5% of the DiaSorin equivocal results had a non-equivocal final result, but all revised results were concordant with WB. Only two samples were equivocal on more than one assay. One sample was HSV-1 IgG positive only by WB and had initially equivocal results on the Bio-Rad HSV-1 IgG assay and the DiaSorin HSV-2 IgG assay.

### Effect of HSV-2 infection on subsequent HIV acquisition: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^114jaGa4]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Another potential threat to validity was misclassification bias of the exposure to HSV-2 infection. Misclassification bias can occur if HSV-2 exposure is defined solely according to HSV-2 antibody status at baseline and some unexposed individuals seroconvert to HSV-2 during the study. Although exposure status was defined solely on baseline HSV-2 infection status in half of the studies estimating the association between prevalent HSV-2 infection and HIV acquisition, we found only weak indication that the association between HSV-2 and HIV was lower in those studies. However, in our meta-regression analyses, estimates were significantly increased for unknown definition of the unexposed comparison group, which might be a proxy for poor study quality more generally.

To minimise the risk of reverse causation, we only included longitudinal studies and categorised estimates for effect of incident HSV-2 infection on HIV acquisition according to the timing of HSV-2 infection compared with HIV seroconversion. For our principal meta-analysis and meta-regression, we restricted inclusion of estimates for incident HSV-2 infection to when incident HSV-2 infection was known with greatest certainty to have occurred before HIV seroconversion (i.e. timing 1), excluding any estimates for which HSV-2 infection was known to or might have occurred after HIV infection. By erring on the side of caution, we might have inadvertently excluded estimates for when HSV-2 infection occurred before HIV in studies where testing was not done sufficiently frequently to disentangle the sequence of infection.

### Therapeutic vaccine for genital herpes simplex virus-2 infection: Findings from a randomized trial [^115vB2Gd]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). High credibility.

- **Methods**: We recruited healthy, HSV-2–seropositive adults aged 18–50 years with a history of recurrent genital herpes for at least one year, experiencing 3–9 recurrences per year without antiviral suppressive therapy. HSV-2 infection was confirmed via Western blot, HSV-2 HerpeSelect 2 immunoglobulin G (IgG)–specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; positive result indicated by an index value of > 3.5), HSV-2 IgG Liaison assay, or type-specific culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Findings were validated for all participants using the HSV-2 IgG Liaison assay during screening.

	- **Exclusion criteria**: Participants in an immunocompromised state, those with antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis C virus, those with a presence of hepatitis B virus surface antigen, pregnant or nursing individuals, those with a history of genital HSV-1 infection, ocular HSV infection, HSV-related erythema multiforme, HSV meningitis or encephalitis, or those who had previously received an HSV-2 vaccine were excluded. Effective contraception was required throughout the study.

- **Study vaccine**: GEN-003 is a purified protein subunit vaccine comprising a transmembrane deletion mutant of gD (gD2ΔTMR) and a large fragment of infected cell protein 4 (ICP4.2) from HSV-2 (strain G). GEN-003 also contained Matrix-M2 (Novavax, Gaithersburg, MD) at a concentration of 50 µg per dose. Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline was used as a diluent (or as a placebo) to achieve a volume of 0.5 mL for intramuscular administration. For participants assigned to receive antigen only, Matrix-M2 was not included with the antigens.

### Therapeutic vaccine for genital herpes simplex virus-2 infection: Findings from a randomized trial [^111CNvNE]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). High credibility.

Study procedures:

After obtaining informed consent but before randomization and dosing, participants collected genital swab samples twice daily for 28 days and maintained a diary of genital lesions (baseline). To be eligible for randomization, participants were required to provide a minimum of 44 baseline shedding swab specimens. The swabbing procedure was repeated immediately after the third dose of vaccine and from weeks 29 to 33 and weeks 53 to 57 (referred to as 6 and 12 months after the last dose of vaccine, respectively). The initial protocol specified only the first post-dosing shedding evaluation and was later amended to include 6- and 12-month collection periods.

Participants were randomized sequentially into 3 cohorts defined by antigen dose (10, 30, or 100 µg of each antigen). Within each dose cohort, participants were randomized at a 3:1:1 ratio to receive either complete GEN-003, HSV-2 antigens without the adjuvant (antigens only), or placebo. Participants were randomized in blocks of 10 by a computer-based system to ensure an assignment to GEN-003, antigens only, and placebo at a ratio of 3:1:1. The study product was administered intramuscularly in the deltoid approximately 21 days apart. The study vaccine was prepared and administered by unblinded staff not involved in subsequent study procedures. Investigators and other clinic personnel, as well as participants, were blinded to treatment assignment. Clinical laboratory evaluation was performed prior to treatment and at intervals thereafter. Blood specimens were collected for assessment of cellular immune responses.

### T-cell responses to HSV-1 in persons who have survived childhood herpes simplex encephalitis [^116ToU9F]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) after primary herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 infection can occur in children due to inborn errors of cell-intrinsic immunity in the central nervous system. Paradoxically, symptomatic mucocutaneous HSV-1 recurrences are rare among survivors of childhood HSE. T-cell-acquired immunity is thought to be involved in the control of recurrent mucocutaneous HSV infection; therefore, we tested HSV-1-specific immunity in HSE survivors.

- **Methods**: We obtained serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from participants a median of 13.5 years after HSE. HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG were detected by type-specific immunoblot. PBMCs from subjects passing quality control criteria were tested using enzyme-linked immunospot assay for CD4 interferon-γ responses with an HSV-1 lysate and for CD8 responses using pooled synthetic HSV-1 peptide CD8 T-cell epitopes. Healthy adult PBMCs were used to standardize assays and as comparators.

- **Results**: All participants were HSV-1 seropositive. Most (23/24) HSE survivors had human leukocyte antigen class I types matching the human leukocyte antigen restriction of the pooled peptides. We detected HSV-specific CD8 T-cell responses in 14 of 24 (58%) HSE survivors and in 9 of 9 healthy HSV-1 seropositive adults. HSV-specific CD4 T-cell responses were present in all 5 HSE subjects tested and in 8 of 9 healthy adults, with response magnitudes overlapping between subject groups.

- **Conclusions**: The defects in cell-intrinsic immunity leading to failure to control primary central nervous system HSV-1 infection do not preclude the acquisition of specific T-cell responses.

### The assessment of IgG avidity in the evaluation of perinatal herpes simplex virus infection [^111nnSAz]. Journal of Perinatology (2002). Low credibility.

Classical serologic assays are not useful for the diagnosis of perinatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection during the acute phase of the disease. We report two cases of neonatal HSV infection that highlight the diagnostic value of HSV-specific IgG avidity and its contribution to further characterization of neonatal HSV infection.

### Seropositivity to herpes simplex virus type 2, but not type 1, is associated with premature cardiovascular diseases: a population-based cross-sectional study [^1146zu54]. Atherosclerosis (2013). Low credibility.

Thirty-five years after herpesviruses were suggested to induce atherosclerosis, sero-epidemiological evidence on Herpes Simplex Viruses (HSV) remains sparse and controversial. We aimed to investigate the relationship between HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections and cardiovascular diseases (CVD).

A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 14,415 participants (mean age 34.3 years, range 20–49) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999–2010. Serum IgG antibodies to HSV were measured by enzymatic immunodot assay, and CVD were self-reported. CVD prevalence was 1.8%, with 51.3% of participants infected with HSV-1, 7.5% with HSV-2, and 15.2% with both. After adjusting for demographics, socioeconomic status, comorbidities, STD, and CVD risk factors, seropositivity to HSV-2 was positively associated with CVD (odds ratio [OR] 1.56, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09–2.21, P = 0.014), but not with HSV-1 (OR 1.13, 95% CI: 0.79–1.62).

HSV-2 may be associated with premature CVD, but not HSV-1.

### Herpes simplex virus type 1 in Europe: Systematic review, meta-analyses and meta-regressions [^111fvSej]. BMJ Global Health (2020). Low credibility.

**Quality assessment**: Online supplementary table s11 summarises the quality assessment of seroprevalence studies (n = 179). A total of 149 studies (83.2%) had high precision, 45 studies (25.1%) had low ROB in the sampling methodology domain, and 12 studies (6.7%) had low ROB in the response rate domain. Only five studies (2.8%) had low ROB in both quality domains. Despite this, the meta-regression analyses (table 3) did not demonstrate an association between these study quality variables and HSV-1 seroprevalence, suggesting a minimal impact on the findings of this study.

### Rapid diagnosis of herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 bloodstream infections utilizing a sample-to-answer platform [^113b3tBH]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

Results

- **Comparison of HSV detection and cycle threshold values in paired blood samples**: A total of 18 samples from patients with known PCR-confirmed HSV-positive results were tested for the presence of HSV-1 and HSV-2 DNA in blood or serum using the Simplexa Direct assay, and Ct values were compared in a subset of these 18 samples where paired whole blood, plasma, serum, or PBMC samples were available. HSV-1 or HSV-2 DNA was detected across different blood compartments, ranging from 18.8% (3/16 in PBMC) to 100% (14/14 in serum) of patients. Notably, both HSV-1 and HSV-2 DNA were detected in the serum of all six patients presenting HSV-positive lesions, with a detection rate of 100%. The detection rates for HSV DNA were comparable in whole blood and diluted PBS plasma, with a detection rate of 94.4%. Furthermore, the two HSV-1 samples, for which HSV-1 was not detectable in whole blood or plasma, exhibited positive detection in serum, each with a Ct value of 38.6. Poor detection was observed in undiluted plasma and PBMC, with a detection rate of 66.7% and 18.8%, respectively. Notably, among the undiluted plasma samples (4 out of 18), invalid results and internal control failures were observed, with internal control amplification occurring in only 77.8% (14 out of 18) of the samples tested. Four samples with initially invalid results were also invalid upon repeat, likely due to existing interfering instances in plasma, aligning with findings from an article by Kuypers, which reported a high invalid rate with plasma samples using the same method.

### First HSV-1 non-primary genital herpes in two patients [^1147A3dW]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2016). Low credibility.

The occurrence of first HSV-1 genital episodes in HSV-2 infected patients had not been demonstrated until the observation of the two cases under discussion. This rarity may indicate a lower prevalence of HSV-2 in Western populations; however, it also raises questions about the potential for cross-protection between these viral types.

### No. 208-guidelines for the management of herpes simplex virus in pregnancy [^112KeUzV]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2017). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for genital herpes, particularly in pregnant patients, the SOGC 2017 guidelines recommend performing type-specific serology testing. This is advised for pregnant patients without a history of HSV but with a previous partner with genital HSV, to determine her risk of acquiring genital HSV in pregnancy before or as early in pregnancy as possible. Repeat testing is recommended at 32–34 weeks of gestation.

### Recommendations for the selective use of herpes simplex virus type 2 serological tests [^11595pSj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type-specific serological tests are now widely available, but indications for their use have not been well defined. The California Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) Controllers Association convened a committee of clinicians and researchers to make recommendations for the use of type-specific HSV type 2 (HSV-2) serological tests.

- **Methods**: By means of a systematic review of the literature, evidence to support screening in selected high-risk groups was compiled. Screening recommendations were developed by applying standard screening criteria to each specific population.

- **Results**: The committee concluded that, in addition to serological testing for the diagnostic evaluation of patients with symptoms, screening of asymptomatic patients is likely to be beneficial among certain groups. These include individuals at high risk for STDs and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who are motivated to reduce their sexual risk behavior, HIV-infected patients, and patients with sex partners who have genital herpes. In contrast, universal screening for HSV-2 infection in pregnant women is unlikely to be beneficial.

- **Conclusions**: The targeted use of HSV-2 serological tests for specific diagnostic situations and selected populations should benefit patients, providers, and the community. Until more data become available, these recommendations provide justification for selective diagnostic and screening uses of HSV-2 serological tests.

### Genital herpes: Rapid evidence review [^116D33iw]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for genital herpes, specifically in the context of laboratory testing, the AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining type-specific serologic testing for HSV-2 when there is a higher clinical suspicion for HSV-2. This is particularly important in cases such as recurrent episodes, atypical lesions, lesions with negative PCR or culture results, or in patients with HIV infection.

### Performance of a commercial, type-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of herpes simplex virus type 2-specific antibodies in Ugandans [^113qudo9]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2004). Low credibility.

Two hundred forty-eight human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive and 496 HIV-negative subjects in Uganda were tested by HerpeSelect herpes simplex virus type 2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blotting to optimize the ELISA for use in this population. A higher index cutoff value was required for optimal sensitivity and specificity, and overall performance of the assay was not affected by HIV status.

### Incidence of serum antibody titers against herpes simplex virus in Japanese patients [^111tQrfX]. The Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) establishes latency in the sensory neuronal ganglia after primary infection and occasionally causes reinfection, mainly on the lips or genitalia. Previous reports revealed an age-related increase in HSV-immunoglobulin G seropositive subjects in a hospital-based study and the general population in Japan. In this report, we retrospectively analyzed the results of serological tests against HSV, in which subjects were diagnosed with or suspected as having HSV infection. A total of 1,216 subjects with at least one complement fixation (CF) result were included. Of these, 771 subjects (63.4%) were positive at the first visit.

- **Incidence by age**: When stratified by age, the incidence of positive patients linearly increased with age from teenagers (44.9%) to those in their 80s (88.9%).
- **Gender differences**: Positivity in women was higher than in men overall; a significantly higher incidence was observed in women aged in their 30s, 40s, and 60s.
- **Seroconversion analysis**: When observing changing HSV-CF titers over time in 81 initially negative patients, 18 (22%) seroconverted during the 2,121-day observation period.

In this study, we clearly show that the distribution of HSV-CF titers is similar to previous HSV-immunoglobulin G results. This correlation is probably caused by the continual subclinical proliferation of HSV, thus maintaining CF titers. Our observations provide data on the incidence of HSV, reconfirming that serological examination is unreliable in diagnosing herpes re-infections, and the majority of infected subjects are asymptomatic.

### Effect of HSV-2 infection on subsequent HIV acquisition: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^117UWQPD]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase between Jan 1, 2003, and May 25, 2017, to identify studies of the relative risk (RR) of HIV acquisition after exposure to HSV-2 infection either at baseline (i.e. prevalent infection) or during follow-up (i.e. incident infection), published since the review by Freeman and colleagues. For PubMed, we searched for articles and abstracts using the terms "HIV", "human immunodeficiency virus", "human immunedeficiency virus", "human immune deficiency virus", or "human immuno deficiency virus" and "HSV", "herpes simplex", "herpes virus type 2", "herpes virus 2", "herpesvirus 2", "genital herpes", or "herpes genitalis". Articles in PubMed were also searched with the Medical Subject Headings terms "herpes simplex" or "simplexvirus" and "human immunodeficiency virus", "HIV infection", "HIV antibodies", "HIV seronegativity", or "HIV seroprevalence". We included studies if they were a cohort study, controlled trial, or case-control study (including case-control studies nested within a cohort or controlled trial); were designed to assess the effect of preceding HSV-2 infection, compared with HSV-2 negativity, on HIV acquisition (i.e. excluding case-control studies based on samples from only one point in time and studies that only looked at the effect of pre-existing HIV infection on HSV-2 acquisition); and determined the HSV-2 infection status of study participants with an antibody-type-specific assay.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^115fShAF]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

Although each assay's primary result is positive, negative, or equivocal (for the Bio-Rad and DiaSorin assays) for HSV-1 or HSV-2 IgG, each automated assay also provides a semi-quantitative index value. Previous studies have found that "low-positive" index values of < 3.0 (Fig. 2, red line) are associated with more false-positive results and a decreased positive predictive value. Indeed, when samples are grouped by index value, samples with positive index values < 3.0 have the highest percentage of false-positive results for both HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG on all instruments. This is especially true for the DiaSorin instrument where 76.1% of low-positive index values are falsely positive for HSV-1 IgG, and 38.7% of low-positive results are falsely positive for HSV-2 IgG.

### A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase 1 study of a replication-defective herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2 vaccine, HSV529, in adults with or without HSV infection [^113Zo5mH]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV2) causes genital herpes in more than 400 million persons worldwide.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of a replication-defective HSV2 vaccine, HSV529. Twenty adults were enrolled in each of three serogroups: those negative for both HSV1 and HSV2 (HSV1-/HSV2-), those positive or negative for HSV1 and positive for HSV2 (HSV1 ± /HSV2+), and those positive for HSV1 and negative for HSV2 (HSV1+/HSV2-). Sixty participants received vaccine or placebo at 0, 1, and 6 months. The primary endpoint was the frequency of solicited local and systemic reactions to vaccination.

- **Results**: Eighty-nine percent of vaccinees experienced mild-to-moderate solicited injection site reactions, compared with 47% of placebo recipients [95% confidence interval (CI), 12.9%-67.6%; p = 0.006]. Sixty-four percent of vaccinees experienced systemic reactions, compared with 53% of placebo recipients (95% CI, -17.9% to 40.2%; p = 0.44). Seventy-eight percent of HSV1-/HSV2- vaccine recipients had a ≥ 4-fold increase in neutralizing antibody titer after three doses of vaccine, whereas none of the participants in the other serogroups had such responses. HSV2-specific CD4+ T-cell responses were detected in 36%, 46%, and 27% of HSV1-/HSV2-, HSV1 ± /HSV2+, and HSV1+/HSV2- participants, respectively, one month after the third dose of vaccine, and CD8+ T-cell responses were detected in 14%, 8%, and 18% of participants, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: HSV529 vaccine was safe and elicited neutralizing antibody and modest CD4+ T-cell responses in HSV-se.

### Herpes simplex virus type 1 and other pathogens are key causative factors in sporadic Alzheimer's disease [^112Lj5DM]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2015). Low credibility.

In a longitudinal nested case–control study, Lövheim et al. measured plasma HSV antibody samples taken on average 9.6 years before AD diagnosis. In the 360 patients who developed AD and who had a follow-up time of 6.6 years or more, past HSV infection (as indicated by the baseline presence of anti-HSV IgG antibodies) increased the risk of developing AD by a factor of 2.25.

Schretlen et al. evaluated cognitive performance in a group of patients who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, with an average cohort age of 39 years. Schizophrenia patients who were HSV-1 IgG antibody seropositive performed significantly worse on neuropsychological measures (including psychomotor speed, executive functioning, and explicit verbal memory) than the combined HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG antibody seronegative control group. Patients who tested seropositive for HSV-1 had decreased grey matter volume in the anterior cingulate and cerebellum, as seen on morphometric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, compared to the HSV-1 seronegative control group. Poor cognitive test performance correlated with decreased grey matter volume in some of the same brain regions that distinguished the patient subgroups defined by HSV-1 status. Several studies have confirmed significant cognitive impairment in HSV-1 IgG seropositive schizophrenia patients compared to HSV-1 IgG seronegative controls, with average cohort ages reported as 38 to 42 years old. A causal association between exposure to HSV-1 and increased risk for schizophrenia has not been proven; however, HSV-1 exposure in this group of neuropsychiatric research continues to be an area of interest.

### Herpes simplex virus-specific immune responses in subjects with frequent and infrequent orofacial recrudescences [^112yeXYC]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Following the primary infection of the orofacial region with herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1, the virus remains latent in the ganglia for the lifetime of the host but can reactivate at intervals and cause recrudescent lesions. The frequency of these episodes varies considerably from one individual to another.

- **Objectives**: To compare immune responses in two groups of subjects: those with frequent orofacial lesions, defined as 10 or more per year (n = 12), and those with infrequent lesions, defined as three or fewer per year (n = 20).

- **Methods**: Plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected from each individual for the series of immunological tests listed in the following results section.

- **Results**: Although IgG titres specific for HSV, measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), were not different between the two groups, there was a significantly higher HSV-specific IgE titre in the frequent group. The percentages of CD3-, CD4-, and CD8-positive cells in peripheral blood, assessed by flow cytometry, and the in vitro lymphoproliferative response to the non-specific mitogen concanavalin A, did not differ between the two groups. T-cell responses to HSV were assessed by in vitro lymphoproliferation with tritiated thymidine incorporation and subsequent calculation of the stimulation index; cytokine production [interferon (IFN)-gamma and interleukin (IL)-10] into the culture supernatant as a result of the stimulation was measured by ELISAs. The mean ± SEM stimulation index was 4.1 ± 0.2 in the subjects with frequent lesions and 11.8 ± 3.1.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^114QvUSg]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

All samples were tested using the Roche Elecsys HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG immunoassays according to the manufacturer's instructions. In this assay, serum samples are incubated with biotinylated recombinant HSV-1 gG1 or HSV-2 gG2 antigens, and the same antigens are labeled with a ruthenium complex to form a double-antigen sandwich complex. Streptavidin-coated magnetic microparticles are then added, and the sandwich complex binds to this solid phase through the interaction of biotin and streptavidin. The microparticles are then magnetically captured on the surface of an electrode, and all unbound substances are washed away. Applying a voltage to the electrode induces chemiluminescence of the ruthenium complex, which is measured by a photomultiplier. On-board software converts this electrochemiluminescent signal to a cutoff index (COI) based on the manufacturer-supplied calibrators. A COI < or ≥ 1 was considered positive, and reported values ranged from a COI of 0.026–234.8 for HSV-1 and 0.083–575.1 for HSV-2. Linearity was confirmed from 0.1 to 140 for HSV-1 and 0.2–350 for HSV-2. After testing using the Roche Elecsys assays, samples were frozen at −20°C for 2–3 weeks prior to running on the Bio-Rad BioPlex instrument.

### HSV IgG antibody inhibits virus detection in CSF [^116kEd7p]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2012). Low credibility.

Before PCR testing of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), laboratory diagnosis of herpes encephalitis (HSE) was based on virus isolation from brain biopsy. Viral isolation from CSF has limited clinical value due to low virus recovery; the cause for this has not been demonstrated.

- **Objective**: To investigate the role of anti-HSV antibodies on the recovery of HSV from CSF via cell culture.

- **Study design**: HSV-positive CSF samples were evaluated for their ability to neutralize HSV in cell culture. The presence of HSV-specific IgG and IgM antibodies was analyzed using HSV-infected cells. To identify whether HSV-specific IgG is the cause of viral inhibition, IgG was removed using anti-human IgG magnetic beads. Viral inhibition from CSF originating from asymptomatic patients was examined as a comparison.

- **Results**: CSF from 13 patients with acute HSV CNS disease was analyzed. All displayed high levels of viral neutralization to both HSV-1 and HSV-2 regardless of the infecting subtype. Interestingly, all the CSF samples stained strongly for anti-IgG antibody but none for anti-IgM antibody. Removal of IgG from CSF eliminated the viral inhibitory activity. Neutralizing IgG antibody was also found to be common in CSF of most patients, even in the absence of HSV disease.

- **Conclusions**: Viral specific IgG is the major determinant of viral inhibition in CSF and prevents virus recovery in cell culture. In CSF from HSE uninfected patients, viral inhibitory IgG originates from circulating serum antibody and is commonly present in CSF. However, this inhibitory IgG is not protective.

### Rapid diagnosis of herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 bloodstream infections utilizing a sample-to-answer platform [^117KzeoJ]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

Inter- and intra-assay reproducibility for serum: The inter-and intra-assay reproducibility study was conducted using a whole virus control of HSV-1 and HSV-2 diluted in pooled human negative serum at virus concentrations between 2 × 10⁴ copies/mL and 2 × 10² copies/mL for 3 to 5 days (n = 10 to 12 replicates). The means ± SD Ct values and CV are shown in the omitted Table 3. The CV for the inter-assay assessment ranged from 1.0% to 1.4% and 1.6% to 3.0% for HSV-1 and HSV-2, respectively. There was also a high degree of intra-assay precision. The intra-assay assessment ranged from 0.3% to 1.4% and 0.6% to 2.2% for HSV-1 and HSV-2.

Clinical performance comparison in serum specimens: A total of 247 serum specimens from patients with known HSV-positive lesions were tested to assess the clinical performance of the modified Simplexa assay. The total percent agreement was 95% (95% CI, 0.92 to 0.97) between the modified Simplexa assay and the LDTs, with a κ statistic of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.62 to 0.86), indicating moderate agreement between assays for both targets. Overall, a total of 26 positive specimens were detected for HSV-1 (N = 15) and HSV-2 (N = 11) on the modified Simplexa assay, which was also confirmed by the CRM. A negative percent agreement of 94.4% (95% CI, 0.91 to 0.97) was observed for the HSV-1 target, while HSV-2 showed a negative percent agreement of 99.1% (95% CI, 0.97 to 1.0). Both targets had a positive percent agreement of 100% when tested using the modified assay.

### Evaluating the performance of the Focus HerpeSelect® HSV-2 IgG in veterans with chronic hepatitis C infection [^111TNLF5]. Journal of Medical Virology (2015). Low credibility.

Epidemiologic links between chronic hepatitis C and herpes simplex type-2 infection have been suggested; however, type-specific tests for HSV-2 infection have not been validated in patients with chronic hepatitis C infection. The Focus HerpeSelect® HSV-2 IgG (Cypress, California) assay and the Biokit HSV-2 rapid assay (Biokit USA, Lexington, MA) were performed on serum samples obtained from 84 veterans with chronic hepatitis C who demonstrated a previously positive HSV-2 serologic test in their medical records.

- **Positive predictive value and specificity**: Using the Biokit HSV-2 as the comparator assay, the positive predictive value and specificity for the HerpeSelect® HSV-2 assay were 62.1% (95% CI: 49.3–73.8) and 41.9% (95% CI: 27.0–57.9), respectively. Increasing the HerpeSelect® HSV-2 index value defining a positive test result from > 1.1 to ≥ 2.89 increased the assay's specificity to 97.7% (95% CI: 87.7–99.6) and the positive predictive value to 94.1% (95% CI: 71.2–99.0).

In veterans with chronic hepatitis C infection, HerpeSelect® HSV-2 index values between 1.1 and 2.89 should be confirmed with an alternate test for HSV-2 infection.

### High seroprevalence of herpes simplex virus type 2 infection in French human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected outpatients [^114BYacH]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2005). Low credibility.

Using commercially available herpes simplex virus (HSV) type-specific serological diagnostic tests, HSV type 2 (HSV-2) antibody prevalence was assessed in two parallel prospective studies. These studies included 534 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected outpatients living in two areas of northern France. In the first cohort of 434 subjects, 223 (51%) individuals demonstrated a positive HSV-2 serological status, whereas 66 (66%) of 100 subjects in the second cohort were seropositive for HSV-2 (51% versus 66%; P = 0.08).

Among the 223 HSV-2-seropositive subjects identified in the first study cohort, only 22 (10%) had suffered from recurrent anogenital lesions during the past 12 months, while 154 (69%) had no clinical history of herpesvirus infection. Our findings demonstrate high proportions of subclinical and undiagnosed HSV-2 infection in HIV-1-infected individuals and suggest that HSV type-specific serological testing in the French HIV-1-infected subpopulation could be an efficient strategy to diagnose clinically asymptomatic HSV-2 infections.

### Evaluation of confirmatory strategies for detection of type-specific antibodies against herpes simplex virus type 2 [^113Dz3Ye]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2002). Low credibility.

In this study, the optimal combination of three commercial glycoprotein G-2 (gG-2)-based herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) type-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (Euroimmun anti-HSV-2 immunoglobulin G [IgG] ELISA [Eu2], Gull HSV-2-specific IgG ELISA [Gu2], and Radim HSV-2 IgG ELISA [Ra2]) and one gG-2-based HSV-2-specific immunoblot (Euroimmun anti-HSV-1/HSV-2 gG Western blot [EuW]) was determined with regard to diagnostic performance and cost efficiency. Two hundred fifty serum samples were included in this study, 194 of which were from female prostitutes.

- **Sensitivity and specificity**: When a formal primary "gold standard" was defined based on the majority agreement of the commercial tests, with EuW being decisive in stand-off situations, the sensitivity and specificity of the assays in the samples from prostitutes were as follows: Eu2, 100% and 89.22%; Gu2, 94.44% and 96.08%; Ra2, 61.18% and 95.10%; and EuW, 98.90% and 100%.

- **Cost-effective strategy**: The most cost-effective confirmatory strategy in the samples from prostitutes was screening with Eu2, retesting positive and equivocal samples with Gu2, and resolving the remaining discordant results with EuW (estimated additional costs per sample, 79.02%; sensitivity, 100%; positive predictive value, 96.81%).

Applying a self-developed gG-2-independent assay to the discordant and concordant negative samples in the samples from prostitutes suggested that the primary gold standard may have missed six HSV-2-positive samples. In conclusion, confirmatory strategies based on commercial gG-2-dependent seroassays result in an increase in the specificity of HSV-2-specific serology.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^113Yxmpo]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections are among the most common and stigmatized infections worldwide, affecting over 4 billion people globally and over 100 million Americans. Despite this prevalence, most individuals are unaware of their infection status, and antibody testing is not recommended, partly due to poor test performance.

This study compared the test performance of the Roche Elecsys HSV-1 IgG and HSV-2 IgG, DiaSorin LIAISON HSV-1/2 IgG, and Bio-Rad BioPlex 2200 HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG assays against the gold-standard HSV western blot in 1,994 individuals. This included 1,017 individuals with PCR or culture-confirmed HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 infection. Across all samples, the Bio-Rad and Roche assays demonstrated similar performance metrics. Both showed low sensitivity (97%) for detecting HSV-1 IgG and high sensitivity (> 97%) and high specificity (> 98%) for detecting HSV-2 IgG.

The DiaSorin assay exhibited a higher sensitivity (92.1%) but much lower specificity (88.7%) for detecting HSV-1 IgG and relatively poor sensitivity (94.5%) and specificity (94.2%) for detecting HSV-2 IgG. Additionally, the DiaSorin assay performed inadequately at low-positive index values, with 60.9% of DiaSorin HSV-1 results and 20.8% of DiaSorin HSV-2 results with positive index values < 3.0 yielding false positive results.

Based on an estimated HSV-2 seroprevalence of 12% in the United States, the positive predictive values for HSV-2 IgG were 96.1% for Roche, 87.4% for Bio-Rad, and 69.0% for DiaSorin. This means that nearly one in three positive DiaSorin HSV-2 IgG results would be falsely positive. Further development in HSV testing is necessary to improve diagnostic accuracy.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^1124YUrG]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

We reviewed the original WB blots for 25 of the samples that were discordant with the WB on two or three automated assays. These samples were selected to represent all four possible discordant situations (e.g. HSV-1 IgG positive by WB but negative by the automated assays), and 12 of these samples were originally adsorbed or repeated during clinical testing. For this review, independent readers were aware that there was a discordance but blinded to what assays were discordant.

On review, no readers would have changed the final interpretation of any blots, but there were three samples — two for HSV-2 and one for HSV-1 — that were positive on the WB and negative on all three automated assays where at least one reader would now recommend adsorbing the sample for further clarification. There were only three samples where all three automated instruments called the sample positive for HSV antibodies, and the WB was negative. All three samples were discordant for HSV-1 IgG, and the blot reviewers noted that the HSV-1 blot was more consistent with HSV-1 cross-reactivity than true HSV-1 IgG.

Overall, a review of the original WBs for a subset of samples where multiple automated assays were discordant with the WB found that 3 out of 25 samples would now be recommended for further testing (e.g. adsorption), but the expert readers agreed with the original clinical WB result in the vast majority of cases (88%). For this assay comparison study, the WB results were considered the ground truth even for samples where more than one assay was discordant with the WB.

### Performance of a novel test for IgM and IgG antibodies in subjects with culture-documented genital herpes simplex virus-1 or -2 infection [^111GaYeX]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2006). Low credibility.

Novel tests (BioPlex) for herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2 IgG were compared with HerpeSelect HSV-1 and HSV-2 ELISAs for type-specific IgG. The sensitivity and specificity of BioPlex HSV-1 IgG were 94% (84/89) and 96% (119/124), respectively, with unselected sera, while the sensitivity and specificity of BioPlex HSV-2 IgG were 92% (109/118) and 98% (95/97), respectively.

BioPlex IgM was compared with Diamedix IgM against sera from patients with culture-documented genital herpes. The test results were concordant in 81% of sera from HSV-1 patients and in 90% of sera from HSV-2 patients. Use of BioPlex IgM in addition to BioPlex IgG tests increased HSV-2 seroconversion detection from 47% of subjects to 70%. Use of Diamedix IgM in addition to Focus IgG ELISA increased HSV-2 detection from 40% of subjects to 70%. IgM was detected by BioPlex in 63% of sera from patients with early HSV-2 infection (< 30 days) and in 59% of sera by Diamedix.

IgM was also detected in a large proportion of sera from subjects with established HSV-2 infection: 33% by BioPlex and 29% by Diamedix. The addition of IgM testing substantially increased the ability to detect seroconversion early in infection. IgM is an indicator of recent infection only in subjects who lack detectable IgG.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^113jtARy]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

Estimates of test characteristics: We calculated the sensitivities and specificities from all 1,996 samples to estimate the overall performance of these assays. Using the 2015–2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) population prevalence in the United States for persons aged 14–49, we found HSV-1 prevalence to be 48% and HSV-2 prevalence to be 12%. Based on these sensitivities and specificities, which were derived from all samples tested, we calculated the positive and negative predictive values for each assay and modeled the effect of changes in prevalence on the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV).

- **Figure 5**: The positive and negative predictive values for each assay as a function of prevalence, based on the sensitivities and specificities calculated from all samples tested.
	- **A**: Modeling of the positive and negative predictive values by prevalence for each HSV-1 IgG assay. The gray line indicates a population prevalence for HSV-1 in the United States of 48%.
	- **B**: Modeling of the positive and negative predictive values by prevalence for each HSV-2 IgG assay. The gray line indicates the expected population prevalence for HSV-2 in the United States of 12%. For all plots, the shaded areas represent the percent uncertainty for the sensitivity and specificity, set to the 95% CI of either the sensitivity or specificity, whichever was larger.

### Twenty years of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) research in low-income and middle-income countries: Systematic evaluation of progress made in addressing who priorities for research in HSV-2 epidemiology and diagnostics [^111deMyX]. BMJ Global Health (2024). Low credibility.

Higher HSV-2 prevalence was found in women compared with men. This gender discrepancy appears constant over different geographical areas and could be due to a higher biological susceptibility to HSV-2 infection in women than in men. As would be expected for a virus that causes lifelong infection, most studies found that HSV-2 prevalence is strongly associated with age.

However, the review's findings also draw attention to the limited research that explores the reasons for the high HSV-2 prevalence in young adults (mean age = 25 years), particularly among women from sub-Saharan Africa. The findings also highlight the limited research that examines the contribution of HSV-2 to genital ulcer disease (GUD). Given that HSV-2 infection can lead to GUD, more studies are required.

We found no HSV-2 studies based in the Middle East, North Africa, and Eastern Europe during the studied period. However, because we excluded non-English language records and could not use separate search terms for each developing country, we likely missed several relevant studies specific to those regions.

All the research priorities for HSV-2 diagnostics were addressed, at least in part. Substantial progress was made in DNA detection methods and in exploring the performance of existing serological assays in different African sera. More accurate and rapid DNA detection techniques continue to be researched, and many African countries have ascertained the most accurate ELISA for their populations. However, establishing the optimal genital sampling technique was a research priority that was only partially addressed.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^112166oi]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

To further examine automated HSV serology assay performance, we utilized a unique cohort of 1,017 individuals with genital HSV infections confirmed by PCR or culture through genital herpes studies at the UW VRC from 1981 to 2019. For this study, we included samples from individuals with PCR- or culture-confirmed genital herpes who underwent serological testing using the WB at least 6 months (median 5.8 years, range 6 months to 50 years) after the initial episode of genital herpes. Given the focus on genital herpes, 886 (87%) of this cohort had PCR- or culture-confirmed HSV-2 infections, and 131 (13%) had PCR- or culture-confirmed genital HSV-1 infections. The WB results were 100% concordant with the PCR or culture results. Of the 886 individuals with confirmed HSV-2 genital infections, 320 (36%) also had HSV-1 antibodies detected on the WB, most likely from prior HSV-1 infection.

The VRC cohort included 669 women (65.8%) and 348 men (34.2%) who provided samples between 1981 and 2019 (median 1989). The majority were white (86.3%), and the overall median age was 34.3 years (range: 16–88 years, Table S2; Fig. S2).

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^112fMEv8]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

Herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) are important human pathogens that cause lifelong infections characterized by latent infection with cycles of viral mucosal replication. Classically, HSV infections present with episodes of recurrent, painful lesions of the oral or genital epithelium, but many infected persons remain asymptomatic. HSV is characterized by two types:

- **HSV-1**: Near-ubiquitous and infects an estimated 67% of the world's population and approximately 48% of adults in the United States of America. HSV-1 is associated with oral lesions but is an increasingly recognized cause of genital herpes.

- **HSV-2**: Classically associated with genital herpes and infects approximately 13% of adults worldwide and approximately 12% of adults in the United States of America.

HSV infections can be diagnosed by detecting the virus itself — typically through culture or PCR — or detecting antibodies against viral proteins. The HSV lifecycle, which includes cycles of lytic and latent infection, complicates diagnosis and limits accurate PCR testing to episodes of active mucosal infection. Not all episodes of active mucosal infection are symptomatic, and high rates of asymptomatic shedding mean symptoms alone cannot be used to guide testing to prevent transmission. High-throughput, sensitive, and specific serological diagnostics are required for both clinical care and for potential screening to diagnose the vast majority of HSV infections that currently go undetected.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^111mDKfC]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

Samples were thawed and briefly mixed prior to testing with the DiaSorin LIAISON HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG CLIA, following the manufacturer's instructions. In this assay, magnetic beads coated with recombinant antigens specific for either HSV-1 glycoprotein (gG1) or HSV-2 glycoprotein (gG2) are incubated with patient serum. After washing, the beads are incubated with an isoluminol-conjugated anti-human IgG mouse monoclonal antibody. A subsequent wash removes any unbound antibody before inducing a flash chemiluminescence reaction. The resulting light signal, measured as relative light units (RLUs), indicates the amount of isoluminol-antibody conjugate and, thus, HSV-1 or HSV-2 IgG present in the sample.

The RLUs are converted to an index value using on-board calculations based on manufacturer-provided calibrators. This index value categorizes samples as negative, with a range from 0.1 to 62.2 for the DiaSorin HSV-1 assay and from 0.03 to greater than 23.6 for the HSV-2 assay. Linearity was confirmed for index values between 0.1 and 47 for HSV-1 and between 0.15 and 21 for HSV-2.

Samples that were initially reported as equivocal were repeated at least twice, with the median measurement reported as the final result. For the VRC cohort, the 34 initially equivocal samples were repeated at the end of the study, following an additional freeze-thaw cycle.

### A case report of isolated primary herpes-simplex virus neuroretinitis in an immunocompetent adult [^116Cdxmb]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex viruses, specifically HSV-1 and HSV-2, are greatly prevalent. In 2016, 66.6% of the world's population aged 15–49 years were living with HSV type 1 infection, and 13.2% with HSV type 2. The spectrum of disease includes primary and reinfections that cause cutaneous or genital herpes, encephalitis, conjunctivitis, and keratitis, establishing a lifelong latent infection with reactivations. Other ocular disorders, such as acute retinal necrosis syndrome or neuroretinitis, are rare occurrences for these pathogens. Asymptomatic primary infection is the most frequent form observed in patients with herpes simplex virus (HSV).

We report the case of an isolated unilateral neuroretinitis as a manifestation of a primary HSV infection in an immunocompetent adult without encephalitis or other related clinical features.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^112jtTBc]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

Most high-throughput HSV serology assays detect type-specific IgG responses to the HSV-1 or HSV-2 glycoprotein G (gG 1 for HSV-1 and gG 2 for HSV-2), which share only ~40% amino acid identity. However, IgG to gG 1 and gG 2 may still be cross-reactive and insufficiently specific, leading the United States Preventive Services Task Force to recommend against screening for genital herpes infections among asymptomatic adolescents and adults. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) Treatment Guidelines recommend a two-step testing process, using a sensitive enzyme/chemiluminescence assay for screening followed by a second, more specific confirmatory assay.

The gold standard for confirmatory serological diagnosis of HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections is a western blot (WB) that detects serological responses to multiple proteins within a viral lysate. This assay is highly sensitive and specific, but it is laborious and thus costly, only being available in the United States at one reference lab. Here, we examined the sensitivity and specificity of three fully automated, high-throughput, type-specific HSV-1/2 IgG assays compared to the HSV western blot in two clinical cohorts comprising 1,994 individuals.

### Value of herpes simplex virus type-specific serology: a case report [^117DgG72]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2012). Low credibility.

Genital herpes, usually caused by herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases in humans. By contrast, intrauterine HSV-2 infections have been described rarely in the literature. Our report describes a case of a neonate who was delivered after 30+2 gestational weeks by cesarean section. He presented with respiratory distress syndrome resulting in bronchopulmonary dysplasia. At the age of 6 weeks, a chorioretinal scar was detected. During the 4th month of age, the infant developed recurrent HSV-2 infection with nasal lesions. The retrospective type-specific serologic diagnosis revealed a previous HSV-2 infection of the mother, resulting in prenatal HSV-2 infection of the infant. In conclusion, intrauterine HSV-2 infections may be underrepresented since they may not be associated with severe congenital malformations, and the diagnosis requires the use of HSV type-specific serologic methods not widely applied in microbiological laboratories.

### Characteristics of herpes simplex virus infection and pathogenesis suggest a strategy for vaccine development [^112LJQK7]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2019). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) belongs to the alpha subfamily of the human herpesvirus family and includes HSV1 and HSV2, which are responsible for pandemics of various herpes diseases. Both pathogens have similar structural characteristics and are of concern worldwide. This concern arises not only because the clinical outcome of oral or genital ulcerative lesions has long-lasting impacts on patient quality of life, but also because ocular herpes can lead to blindness, and neonatal herpes or encephalitis can result in higher death rates. Additionally, these viruses show higher infection rates in various age groups.

Although observations of epidemics in various areas have described different pandemics, infection rates of at least 30% to 60% for HSV1 and 10% to 25% for HSV2 have been recognized by most researchers, and approximately 23 million new cases of HSV2 infection are reported annually. It is not surprising that a viral disease with such severe clinical outcomes and such a strong spreading trend has been targeted for prophylactic vaccine development.

At the time of writing, more than 10 HSV prophylactic vaccines, primarily targeting HSV2, have been developed and evaluated in human clinical trials. These vaccines contain antigens that effectively stimulate immune responses and immune memory, as measured by the indicators of neutralizing antibody and specific cellular immune responses in animals or humans. These data suggest that the viral antigens selected and designed for vaccines are effective, and the host immune system is capable of recognizing HSV.

### Inaccuracy of certain commercial enzyme immunoassays in diagnosing genital infections with herpes simplex virus types 1 or 2 [^1121gRzg]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

Type-specific serologic results may be inaccurate if not based on glycoprotein G (gG). Commercial tests based on crude antigen from Zeus Scientific (Raritan, NJ), Wampole Laboratories (Cranbury, NJ), and DiaSorin (Stillwater, MN), and one using gG-1 and gG-2 from Focus Technologies (Cypress, CA), were compared with Western blot on serum samples from patients with culture-documented first symptomatic episodes of genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 (n = 17) or HSV-2 (n = 49) infection, or recurrent genital episodes (HSV-1, 30; HSV-2, 49).

- **Concordance**: With Western blot results, concordance was 56% for Zeus, 63% for Wampole, 52% to 54% for DiaSorin, and 83% for Focus.

- **Sensitivity and specificity**:
	- For HSV-1 they were 77% and 53% (Zeus), 91% and 35% (Wampole), 98% and 8% (DiaSorin), 94% and 70% (DiaSorin predominant antibody), and 83% and 90% (Focus).
	- For HSV-2, sensitivity and specificity were 88% and 81% (Zeus), 92% and 83% (Wampole), 96% and 54% (DiaSorin), 38% and 98% (DiaSorin predominant antibody), and 98% and 96% (Focus).

Type-specific serologic testing for HSV should be performed with gG-based tests for accurate diagnosis of symptomatic genital herpes.

### Performance of HerpeSelect and Kalon assays in detection of antibodies to herpes simplex virus type 2 [^116Eueyv]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2008). Low credibility.

The performances of commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) in detecting herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) antibodies have been inconsistent for African and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive populations. We compared the performances of the HerpeSelect and Kalon glycoprotein G2 ELISAs for patients with genital ulcer disease in Ghana and the Central African Republic. Sera from 434 women were tested with the HerpeSelect assay, and a subsample (n = 199) was tested by the Kalon assay.

Ulcer swabs and cervicovaginal lavage samples were tested for HSV-2 DNA by PCR. HSV-2-seronegative women with detectable genital HSV-2 DNA were retested for HSV-2 antibodies 14 and 28 days later by the two ELISAs. A total of 346 (80%) women were positive by HerpeSelect at baseline, and 225 (54%) had detectable genital (lesional or cervicovaginal) HSV-2 DNA. Sixty-six (19%) HerpeSelect-positive samples had low-positive index values (1.1 to 3.5), and 58% of these samples had detectable genital HSV-2 DNA.

Global agreement between the two serological assays was 86%. Concordance was high (99%) for sera that were negative by HerpeSelect or had high index values (> 3.5). Defining infection detected by HSV-2 DNA PCR and/or Kalon assay as true infection, 71% of sera with low-positive index values were associated with true HSV-2 infection. Twenty-five women were identified as having nonprimary first-episode genital HSV-2 infection. Rates of HSV-2 seroconversion at day 14 were 77% (10/13 patients) by HerpeSelect assay and 23% (3/13 patients) by Kalon assay, with four additional seroconversions observed.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^116aS4LE]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

The VRC cohort comprises samples positive for HSV-1 or HSV-2 antibodies based on both WB results and viral confirmation of genital infection. In this cohort, all automated instruments exhibited lower sensitivity and specificity for detecting HSV-1 IgG, with all instruments having sensitivity below 90%. Conversely, the automated assays were more sensitive for detecting HSV-2 antibodies than in a typical screening population. However, the specificity for HSV-2 IgG was lower in this cohort compared to a broader population.

When analyzing only samples with PCR- or culture-confirmed HSV-1 or HSV-2 genital infection, sensitivity for the HSV-1 IgG assays did not improve: 80.6% for Bio-Rad, 87.8% for DiaSorin, and 69.5% for Roche. For HSV-2, sensitivity remained largely unchanged and was within 0.6% of their values from the full cohort, while assay specificities for this subset also remained consistent compared to the full cohort.

- **Equivocal results**:
	- **Bio-Rad instrument**: 16 equivocal results (13 for HSV-1 IgG, 3 for HSV-2 IgG)
	- **DiaSorin instrument**: 34 equivocal results (18 for HSV-1 IgG, 16 for HSV-2 IgG)

In contrast to the clinical testing cohort, where most of the Bio-Rad results had non-equivocal outcomes, only 25% of the Bio-Rad equivocal results in the VRC cohort had a non-equivocal result upon retesting. All four revised results became permanent.

### Sero-epidemiological patterns of Epstein-Barr and herpes simplex (HSV-1 and HSV-2) viruses in England as well as Wales [^1178HwA1]. Journal of Medical Virology (2002). Low credibility.

The aim was to carry out a population-based seroprevalence survey of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) across a wide age range in England as well as Wales, and to identify any associations between EBV and herpes simplex virus types one and two (HSV-1 and 2). Sera from an age-stratified sample of 2,893 individuals, submitted for diagnostic purposes to 15 public health laboratories in England as well as Wales in 1994, were tested for immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody to EBV. The samples had been tested previously for IgG antibody to HSV-1 and HSV-2.

The serological profile of EBV was consistent with an endemic infection, with peaks in transmission in those less than 5 years old and in young adults. An age-adjusted analysis found a significant association between EBV and HSV-1 seropositivity that is most likely explained by similarities in their mode of transmission. The very low seroprevalence of HSV-2 in this sample complicated the comparisons of EBV and HSV-1 with HSV-2. Any associations were most likely explained by chance.

Given the association between EBV and HSV-1, it is likely that recently documented epidemiological changes in HSV-1 also apply to EBV. Continuing surveillance of these herpes viruses is necessary as the predicted changes could have a significant public health impact, especially in the young adult population.

### Common use of inaccurate antibody assays to identify infection status with herpes simplex virus type 2 [^111SeSPb]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

In recent proficiency testing of herpes simplex virus type-specific serologic evidence by the College of American Pathologists, commercially available herpes simplex virus antibody assays that were not glycoprotein-G based demonstrated high false-positive rates (14%-88%) for herpes simplex virus type-2 antibodies in sera that were positive for herpes simplex virus type-1 antibodies but negative for herpes simplex virus type-2 antibodies. Herpes simplex virus serologic testing should be performed with only glycoprotein-G-based tests.

### The management of encephalitis: Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114QcaQD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). High credibility.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) 2008 guidelines recommend obtaining herpes simplex PCR testing on all cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens in patients with encephalitis. In cases where patients with encephalitis have an initial negative test result but present with a compatible clinical syndrome or temporal lobe localization on neuroimaging, it is advised to repeat the herpes simplex PCR 3–7 days later.

### Emergence of herpes simplex type 1 as the main cause of recurrent genital ulcerative disease in women in Northern Ireland [^115m1XoG]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2003). Low credibility.

Genital herpes is a common infection affecting approximately 20% of sexually active individuals. Although herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2 can both establish genital latency, reactivation from the sacral ganglia typically favors HSV-2. Over the past decade, the incidence of type 1 genital infection in women has greatly increased.

- **Objectives**: To determine whether the increased prevalence of HSV-1 genital infection was benign or influencing the pattern of virus recovery in reinfection.

- **Study design**: A retrospective analysis of laboratory computer records was undertaken. Patients attending six genitourinary medicine (GUM) departments over an 80-month period were identified. Reinfection was confirmed where the virus was recovered from at least two separate episodes of genital ulceration that were separated by an interval of 12 or more weeks. Episodes were further analyzed for frequency, age, gender, and virus type.

- **Results**: Sixty-nine patients with genital herpetic reinfection were identified. HSV-1 and HSV-2 were predominantly recovered from genital infections in females (34 HSV-1 vs. ten HSV-2) and males (one HSV-1 vs. 24 HSV-2), respectively (P > 0.001). The mean age of females and males at the initial diagnosis was 26 and 39 years, respectively. There was no difference in the recurrence rate by type.

- **Conclusions**: HSV-1 has become the most common cause of genital ulceration in Northern Ireland, primarily due to its recent increased prevalence in women over the last decade. Women are experiencing genital herpetic infections at an earlier age than before.

### Herpes simplex virus type 2 and heterosexual spread of human immunodeficiency virus infection in developing countries: hypotheses and research priorities [^1163U7Rd]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2003). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection is almost always sexually transmitted and causes genital ulceration. Significant progress in our understanding of HSV infection has occurred over the last decade, partly due to the development of accurate and sensitive laboratory tests to study HSV-2. The application of PCR and type-specific serology to individual cases and in population-based studies has enabled the identification of a potentially important role for HSV-2 infection as a cofactor in the sexual transmission of HIV. This is a particular issue in developing countries. This review describes the epidemiology of HSV-2 infection in the HIV era, the hypotheses regarding HSV-HIV interactions, and research priorities for the developing world.

### Herpes simplex viral infection doubles the risk of dementia in a contemporary cohort of older adults: A prospective study [^1138dXBW]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). Low credibility.

Statistical analyses were conducted on subsamples of anti-HSV, anti–HSV-1, and anti-CMV IgG–seropositive subjects to examine the effects of anti-herpesvirus treatment, anti-HSV IgM, anti-HSV levels, and anti-CMV levels, respectively. The prevalences of educational level (≤ 9 years), sex, APOE ɛ4 carriership, antiviral treatment, AD or dementia, and anti-CMV IgG positivity were compared between participants included and not included in the subsamples using the χ² test. The time to event was defined as the number of days from inclusion to the diagnosis of dementia, if occurring before the 15-year follow-up, or censoring. Censoring occurred on the date of death or at the 15-year follow-up, whichever came first.

Kaplan–Meier survival plots were employed to visualize survival according to anti-HSV IgG carriership. Cox proportional-hazards regression models assessed the risks of incident dementia and AD, respectively, with anti-HSV or anti-CMV IgG as primary predictors in the full sample. In the HSV and HSV1 subsamples, primary predictors included anti-herpesvirus treatment, anti-HSV IgM, and anti-HSV levels. Anti-CMV IgG levels served as the primary predictor in the CMV subsample. Initially, basic models including sex and a primary predictor were constructed. Subsequently, these models were fully adjusted for education and APOE ɛ4 carriership. Interaction terms were then added to the fully adjusted models (primary predictor × APOE ɛ4 or anti-CMV IgG × anti-HSV IgG), when feasible within the covariate limit. This limit was determined by dividing the number of participants with or without the outcome, whichever was smaller, by…

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^114E4WRm]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

In this large-scale comparison of HSV serologic diagnostic methods, we found substantial differences between the performance of three commonly used, automated FDA-cleared immunoassays for detecting HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG manufactured by Bio-Rad, DiaSorin, and Roche. For HSV-1 IgG, there was a clear trade-off between sensitivity and specificity for all assays. The DiaSorin HSV-1 IgG assay had the highest sensitivity but the lowest specificity. On the other hand, the Bio-Rad and Roche HSV-1 IgG assays had lower sensitivities (97%).

For HSV-2, there was a clear best assay with the Roche HSV-2 IgG assay having both the highest sensitivity (97.9%) and highest specificity (99.5%). The Bio-Rad HSV-2 IgG assay was nearly as good as the Roche assay, but the DiaSorin HSV-2 assay performed worst for both sensitivity and specificity. Unfortunately for laboratories, there does not seem to be a one-size-fits-all approach to automated HSV serology assays. Indeed, while our study indicates that at least some automated HSV-2 IgG assays have promising performance metrics, none of the HSV-1 IgG assays tested are adequate.

### Trends in herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2 seroprevalence in the United States [^116PnpZy]. JAMA (2006). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 are common infections worldwide. Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is the cause of most genital herpes and is almost always sexually transmitted. In contrast, HSV-1 is usually transmitted during childhood via nonsexual contacts. Preexisting HSV-1 antibodies can alleviate clinical manifestations of subsequently acquired HSV-2. Furthermore, HSV-1 has become an important cause of genital herpes in some developed countries.

- **Objective**: To examine trends in HSV-1 and HSV-2 seroprevalence in the United States in 1999–2004 compared with 1988–1994.

- **Design, settings, and participants**: Cross-sectional, nationally representative surveys (US National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys [NHANES]) were used to compare national seroprevalence estimates from 1999–2004 with those from 1988–1994. Changes in HSV-1 and HSV-2 seroprevalence since 1976–1980 were reviewed. Persons aged 14 to 49 years were included in these analyses.

- **Main outcome measures**: Seroprevalence of HSV-1 and HSV-2 antibodies based on results from type-specific immunodot assays; diagnosis of genital herpes.

- **Results**: The overall age-adjusted HSV-2 seroprevalence was 17.0% (95% confidence interval, 15.8%-18.3%) in 1999–2004 and 21.0% (95% CI, 19.1%-23.1%) in 1988–1994, a relative decrease of 19.0% between the two surveys (95% CI, -28.6% to -9.5%; p < 0.001). Decreases in HSV-2 seroprevalence were especially concentrated in persons aged 14 to 19 years between 1988 and 2004. In adolescents aged 17 to 19 years and young adults, the decreases in HSV-2 seroprevalence were more pronounced.

### Genital herpes: Rapid evidence review [^115SCbDS]. American Family Physician (2024). Low credibility.

Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted infection caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 or 2. It affects at least 500 million people worldwide and is a lifelong condition involving initial infection and periodic reactivation with variable viral shedding. There are no vaccinations for the prevention of HSV, and routine serologic screening is not recommended in asymptomatic individuals. Practices that prevent or reduce transmission include the use of suppressive antiviral therapy in serodiscordant partners, avoiding sexual contact during outbreaks, and the use of condoms.

A clinically apparent herpes outbreak is characterized by painful vesicles on the genitals, rectum, or perineum and may be accompanied by a flu-like syndrome of fever, malaise, and lymphadenopathy. Diagnosis uses type-specific polymerase chain reaction, viral culture of active lesions, or type-specific serologic testing. Nucleoside analogue medications reduce viral shedding and are used to treat active outbreaks and prevent recurrences. Complications of genital herpes include encephalitis, meningitis, and urinary retention. During pregnancy, antiviral suppression is recommended starting at 36 weeks of gestation in patients with a known history of genital herpes. Elective cesarean delivery should be offered to patients with active lesions to reduce neonatal exposure to HSV.

### Serological testing for herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 and HSV-2 infection [^116izgFD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Serological tests for herpes simplex virus (HSV) that can accurately distinguish between HSV-1 and HSV-2 are now commercially available. These tests detect antibodies to HSV glycoproteins G-1 and G-2, which evoke a type-specific antibody response. Focus Technologies produces the HerpeSelect-1 and HerpeSelect-2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests and the HSV-1 and HSV-2 HerpeSelect1/2 Immunoblot. Diagnology has marketed POCkit-HSV-2, a point-of-care test for HSV-2 that allows blood from a finger stick to be tested in a clinic. These tests can be used to confirm a genital herpes diagnosis, establish diagnosis of HSV infection in patients with atypical complaints, identify asymptomatic carriers, and identify persons at risk for acquiring HSV. Potential settings for use of these tests include sexually transmitted disease clinics, prenatal clinics, and clinics that care for patients with human immunodeficiency virus. Patient interest in HSV serological tests appears high.

### Rapid diagnosis of herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 bloodstream infections utilizing a sample-to-answer platform [^112M8X8g]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

Bloodstream HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections can cause devastating outcomes with high morbidity and mortality, especially in neonates or immunocompromised individuals. Proper patient management for herpes simplex virus (HSV) bloodstream infections is time-sensitive and requires a rapid, accurate, and definitive diagnosis. The absence of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved molecular assays for HSV detection in blood, coupled with a lack of consensus on the optimal sample type, underscores the unmet need for improved diagnostics.

We prospectively compared the cycle threshold values in paired samples, including whole blood (WB), plasma, serum, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with bloodstream HSV infections. This analysis employed a modified use of the FDA-cleared Simplexa HSV-1 & 2 Direct assay. The clinical performance in serum was assessed by comparing the results of 247 remnant specimens on this sample-to-answer platform to established laboratory-developed tests in a blinded fashion. Serum samples exhibited significantly lower cycle thresholds than whole blood samples [2.6 cycle threshold (Ct) bias, P < 0.001].

The modified Simplexa assay demonstrated 100% positive percent agreement for the detection of HSV-1 and HSV-2 DNA in serum samples and yielded an overall agreement of 95% (95% CI, 0.92 to 0.97), with a κ statistic of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.62 to 0.86) compared to the composite reference method. Discordance rates were 5.20% for HSV-1 and 0.81% for HSV-2. This investigation demonstrates that serum is an optimal specimen type for HSV detection.

### Prior herpes simplex virus infection and the risk of herpes zoster [^115Gpkoq]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

The incidence of herpes zoster (HZ) has increased in the United States concurrent with a decrease in herpes simplex virus (HSV) prevalence. We hypothesized that the lack of HSV-elicited cross-reactive immunity to varicella-zoster virus (VZV) results in an increased risk of HZ. Using specimens from the placebo arm of the Shingles Prevention Study, we investigated whether individuals who develop HZ are less likely to have prior HSV infection than those who do not develop HZ, and whether HZ is less severe in individuals with HSV than in HSV seronegative individuals.

- **Methods**: We conducted a nested case-control (1:2) study comparing the seroprevalence of HSV-1 and HSV-2 in cases (individuals with polymerase chain reaction-confirmed HZ) to age-, sex-, and health-matched controls (individuals without HZ).

- **Results**: Sera from 639 study participants (213 cases and 426 controls) yielded definitive HSV antibody results and were analyzed. Overall, the HSV seropositivity rate was 75%. HSV seronegativity was significantly higher in HZ cases than controls (30.5% vs. 22.3%; p = 0.024), with a 55% higher risk of HZ in HSV seronegative compared to HSV seropositive participants. HSV seropositivity was associated with more severe HZ (P = 0.021).

- **Conclusions**: Our study demonstrated that prior infection with HSV partly protects against HZ.

### Risk factors for herpes simplex virus-1/2 viremia and clinical outcomes following unmanipulated haploidentical haematopoietic stem cell transplantation [^112cacjr]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1/2 can still be reactivated after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) even when prophylactic acyclovir is used. However, the risk factors for HSV-1/2 viremia and the clinical outcomes following unmanipulated haploidentical HSCT remain unknown.

- **Objectives and study design**: Nineteen patients with HSV-1/2 viremia and fifty-seven patients without HSV-1/2 viremia, selected using the case-pair method after undergoing haploidentical HSCT, were enrolled. We analyzed the risk factors for HSV-1/2 viremia and compared the clinical outcomes between the two groups.

- **Results**: The risk factors for HSV-1/2 viremia included HLA disparity ≥ 2 loci (p = 0.049) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation (p = 0.028). The incidences of platelet engraftment, oral mucositis, and severe haemorrhagic cystitis (HC) in patients with and without HSV-1/2 viremia were 77% and 94% (p = 0.003), 78% and 13% (p = 0.000), and 25% and 6% (p = 0.04), respectively. Moreover, the median time to platelet engraftment in patients with and without HSV-1/2 viremia was +25 days (range, +11-+80) and +17 days (range, +8-+67) (p = 0.004), respectively. According to the multivariate analyses, HSV-1/2 viremia was associated with delayed platelet engraftment (p = 0.038), a higher incidence of oral mucositis (p = 0.000), and severe HC (p = 0.038). However, HSV-1/2 viremia was not associated with non-relapse mortality (34.0% vs. 31.5%, p = 0.26), leukaemia-free survival (60.9% vs. 57.9%, p = 0.46), and overall survival (61.2% vs. 60.7%, p = 0.37).

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^115FgtVo]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

The *PCR- or culture-confirmed cohort* included serum specimens from individuals with genital lesions that were PCR- or culture-positive for HSV-1 or HSV-2. This cohort was followed by the UW Virology Research Clinic, with participants providing written informed consent approved by the UW Institutional Review Board (IRB). One serum specimen was selected from 1,074 HIV-negative individuals who tested positive for HSV-1 or HSV-2 by PCR and/or culture and were confirmed seropositive for the corresponding HSV type by western blot (WB). Samples were taken at least six months after the initial episode of genital herpes. Some individuals with HSV-2 positive genital lesions tested positive for antibodies against both HSV-2 and HSV-1 with WB. As a result, 131 samples were positive for HSV-1 only with both viral and WB testing, 566 were positive for HSV-2 only, and 320 were positive for HSV-2 with viral testing and antibodies for both HSV-1 and HSV-2 on WB. Virological data on shedding rates in genital herpes infections — measured as the percent of swabs positive for HSV-1 or HSV-2 by non-type-specific PCR over the total number of swabs — were available from 315 of 1,017 individuals in the Virology Research Clinic cohort, with detailed data available in the supplemental data file.

- **Assay comparison**: Various assays were compared, including the DiaSorin Liaison HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG chemiluminescent immunoassays (CLIAs; K081685 and K081687) from DiaSorin, Stillwater, Minnesota, USA, the Roche cobas Elecsys HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG sandwich electrochemiluminescence immunoassays (K120625 and K121895) from Roche, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA, and the Bio-Rad BioPlex HSV-1/2 I.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^114j2Esg]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

Patterns of discordant results for the VRC cohort were similar to those for the clinical testing cohort (Fig. 4). Overall, the DiaSorin instrument alone accounted for at least half of the total false positives for either HSV-1 IgG (78%) or HSV-2 IgG (50%). There was a trend for the VRC cohort to have a larger proportion of samples test falsely positive (13.3% for HSV-1 IgG and 10.7% for HSV-2 IgG) compared to the clinical testing cohort (10.2% for HSV-1 IgG and 6.5% for HSV-2 IgG), likely reflecting the lack of double negative samples in this cohort. There were significantly more HSV-1 IgG false negative results in the VRC cohort than in the clinical testing sample remnant cohort (25.9% vs 16.7%, P-value = 0.002). Conversely, there were significantly fewer HSV-2 false negative results in the VRC cohort than in the clinical testing cohort (3.1% vs 16.4%, P-value < 0.001).

- **Euler plots**: Fig. 4 displays Euler plots showing the number of samples from the VRC cohort that disagree with the WB results for each automated instrument, colored by which instruments were discordant with the WB results. Data are presented in Fig. 1. (A) Number of samples that were negative for HSV-1 IgG by WB but falsely positive on the automated instruments. (B) Number of samples that were positive for HSV-1 IgG by WB but falsely negative on the automated instruments.
