## Question

contraindications of nsaid according to level of gfr

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the contraindications of NSAIDs according to different levels of GFR. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core mechanism of NSAID nephrotoxicity and how it varies with kidney function. Then, I should verify the highest-quality guideline thresholds that define absolute and relative contraindications. Next, I will stratify recommendations by GFR categories, reconcile conflicting evidence, and incorporate drug-specific labeling. After that, I need to integrate risk modifiers and monitoring strategies. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, patient-centered approach and state the bottom line clearly with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic foundation, because the risk gradient by GFR hinges on it. NSAIDs impair renal hemodynamics by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis; in reduced GFR states, prostaglandins compensate to maintain perfusion, so NSAID blockade can precipitate hemodynamic AKI, sodium retention, edema, and hyperkalemia, with risk amplified by concomitant RAAS blockade, diuretics, heart failure, cirrhosis, and older age, and the injury is typically reversible with cessation [^111NimAT] [^113c8s8k] [^114JLXPP] [^113mghML].

> I need to check the highest-credibility thresholds next. Multiple authoritative guidelines converge on a hard threshold: avoid NSAIDs when eGFR is less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m², and exercise strong caution or avoid prolonged therapy when eGFR is below 60 mL/min/1.73 m², with some rheumatology and primary care guidance extending avoidance to eGFR 30 or below and discouraging routine use in CKD altogether [^1158BK29] [^111rWUiu] [^116sjyWs] [^111X1Brb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify drug-specific labeling that sometimes refines these thresholds. Ketoprofen labeling advises a maximum daily dose of 150 mg if GFR is mildly impaired and no more than 100 mg/day if GFR is less than 25 mL/min/1.73 m², which operationalizes a stricter functional threshold for one agent, while celecoxib and other coxibs carry explicit warnings against use in severe renal insufficiency without providing a numeric GFR, reinforcing the qualitative "advanced renal disease" prohibition seen across the class [^111NCVxD] [^113c8s8k] [^116ayrHH] [^116bsvQq].

> Let me stratify by GFR to make this actionable, but I should double-check each tier against guidelines. For eGFR ≥ 60, NSAIDs can be considered short term at the lowest effective dose with attention to volume status and interacting drugs. For eGFR 30–59, use is generally discouraged and, if absolutely necessary, should be short course with close monitoring. For eGFR < 30, NSAIDs should be avoided as a rule, with any exception requiring a compelling indication and specialist oversight, which aligns with KDOQI, VA/DoD OA guidance, and primary care advisories [^1158BK29] [^111rWUiu] [^112sSccL].

> Wait, let me verify the apparent contradiction from observational data suggesting no progression signal at regular doses in moderate-to-severe CKD. A systematic review found no increased risk of accelerated CKD progression with regular-dose NSAIDs but a modest increase with high-dose regimens; however, this does not negate AKI risk or the hemodynamic vulnerability at low GFR, so guideline conservatism remains appropriate, especially given heterogeneity and confounding in observational designs [^114o9Sv7].

> I should confirm that COX-2 selectivity does not confer renal safety. Renal physiology and clinical data indicate COX-2 inhibitors produce sodium retention, blood pressure effects, and GFR reductions comparable to nonselective NSAIDs, so the same GFR-based precautions apply; if an NSAID must be used in higher GI risk patients, pairing with a PPI is reasonable, but this does not mitigate renal risk [^111wT3bX] [^112VpcxK] [^113c8s8k] [^111rWUiu].

> Next, I should review key risk modifiers that shift the threshold toward avoidance even above eGFR 30. Heart failure, cirrhosis, diuretic or RAAS inhibitor therapy, older age, volume depletion, and concomitant nephrotoxins increase NSAID-associated AKI risk, and VA/DoD guidance advises that concomitant RAAS blockade, SGLT2 inhibitors, finerenone, and diuretics compound hemodynamic risk, warranting more frequent eGFR monitoring if NSAIDs are used [^113c8s8k] [^11366CiG] [^112FzdNJ].

> I will now examine practical mitigation and monitoring steps, and I need to ensure they are aligned with evidence. Before prescribing, check baseline creatinine/eGFR, electrolytes, and volume status; use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration; avoid or interrupt NSAIDs during acute illness that threatens renal perfusion; and in patients with eGFR < 60, consider earlier reassessment of renal function after initiation, with some guidance suggesting checks within 1–2 weeks in higher-risk profiles, alongside patient education on OTC NSAID avoidance and hydration [^115P6YDs] [^11366CiG] [^112sSccL].

> Let me consider alternatives and context-specific exceptions, but I should verify each against guidelines. Acetaminophen remains first-line for many pain syndromes in CKD, though hypertension risk at high cumulative doses should be recognized; topical NSAIDs may reduce but do not eliminate AKI risk and can be considered for localized OA pain when oral NSAIDs are undesirable; for gout flares in CKD, prefer low-dose colchicine or glucocorticoids rather than NSAIDs; in austere or postpartum settings, short-term NSAIDs may be acceptable if no contraindications and renal function is preserved, but caution is warranted in pregnancy and in those with eGFR < 30 [^111XtF2K] [^116mPu3s] [^11663mZo] [^114PZgQd] [^111MdUsT] [^114vHRvk].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and edge cases. In older adults with CKD, both prescription NSAIDs and opioids are commonly used. While NSAIDs carry AKI and electrolyte risks, opioids associate with higher risks of hospitalization and mortality, so shared decision-making to define functional goals and minimize exposure to either class is essential. In patients on ARNI therapy, concomitant NSAIDs can worsen renal function, reinforcing the need to avoid or monitor closely if unavoidable [^114NQ9u6] [^1138PpkB] [^112Zq4Cy].

> But wait, what if a patient presents with acute pain and unknown renal function? Point-of-care creatinine with eGFR can change NSAID decisions in a meaningful fraction of patients, supporting a rapid screen-before-script approach in the ED or urgent care to prevent inadvertent nephrotoxic prescribing in unsuspected CKD [^112jjdEo].

> Bottom line, I should confirm the synthesized recommendation clearly. Avoid NSAIDs when eGFR is less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m². Use strong caution and limit to short courses when eGFR is 30–59, with explicit justification and monitoring. Above 60, use judiciously with attention to comorbid risks, lowest dose, shortest duration, and baseline and early follow-up labs, recognizing that the absolute risk of AKI rises as GFR falls and that drug-specific labeling may impose tighter dose ceilings in renal impairment [^1158BK29] [^111rWUiu] [^111NCVxD] [^113c8s8k].

NSAIDs are **contraindicated in patients with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²** because of the high risk of acute kidney injury, electrolyte disturbances, and progression of CKD [^1158BK29] [^111rWUiu]. In patients with eGFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m², NSAIDs should be **avoided if possible**; if use is essential, employ the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration with close monitoring of renal function and electrolytes [^11366CiG]. NSAIDs are generally safe at normal renal function, but **risk increases with lower eGFR**, older age, heart failure, liver disease, and concurrent diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or ARBs [^111NimAT] [^111X1Brb]. For pain control in CKD, prefer acetaminophen or topical NSAIDs, and use opioids only when necessary with careful monitoring [^113AJFLS] [^114SKRP3].

## NSAID contraindications based on GFR levels

| **eGFR level (mL/min/1.73 m²)** | **NSAID use recommendations** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| ≥ 60 (normal to mild impairment) | Generally safe with caution; monitor renal function if risk factors present | Minimal risk of AKI or CKD progression |
| 30–59 (moderate impairment) | Avoid if possible; if essential, use lowest effective dose, shortest duration, and monitor renal function and electrolytes closely | Increased risk of AKI, electrolyte disturbances, and CKD progression |
| < 30 (severe impairment) | Contraindicated | High risk of AKI, electrolyte disturbances, and CKD progression |

## Risks associated with NSAID use in CKD

NSAIDs **impair renal function** in CKD through several mechanisms:

- **Hemodynamic effects**: NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, reducing renal blood flow and GFR, especially in patients with pre-existing renal impairment [^113c8s8k].

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: NSAIDs can cause sodium retention, hyperkalemia, and edema, exacerbating hypertension and heart failure [^113mghML].

- **Acute kidney injury (AKI)**: NSAIDs increase the risk of AKI, particularly in patients with reduced GFR, dehydration, or concurrent use of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or diuretics [^112iWAFa].

- **Progression of CKD**: Long-term NSAID use is associated with accelerated CKD progression, especially at high doses [^114o9Sv7].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Several **clinical guidelines** provide clear recommendations on NSAID use in CKD:

- **KDOQI guidelines**: Avoid NSAIDs in patients with GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m². Prolonged NSAID therapy is not recommended in patients with GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² [^1158BK29].

- **VA/DoD guidelines**: NSAIDs should generally be avoided in patients with CKD, especially those with eGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^116sjyWs].

- **KDIGO guidelines**: Recommend preferring low-dose colchicine or corticosteroids over NSAIDs for symptomatic management of acute gout in patients with CKD [^114PZgQd].

---

## Alternative analgesic options

Given the risks associated with NSAIDs in CKD, **alternative analgesic options** should be considered:

- **Acetaminophen**: Preferred first-line analgesic for mild to moderate pain in CKD. It is generally safe at recommended doses but should be used cautiously in patients with hepatic impairment [^115NtE77].

- **Topical NSAIDs**: Lower systemic absorption and reduced risk of renal adverse effects. Suitable for localized pain management [^11663mZo].

- **Opioids**: Reserved for severe pain unresponsive to other therapies. Require careful monitoring due to risks of respiratory depression, sedation, and dependence [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and precautions

When NSAIDs are deemed necessary in patients with reduced GFR, **the following precautions should be taken**:

- **Baseline assessment**: Evaluate renal function, electrolytes, and volume status before initiating NSAID therapy [^111XtF2K].

- **Dose adjustment**: Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible [^113Lisx3].

- **Regular monitoring**: Monitor renal function and electrolytes closely during therapy, especially in patients with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² [^115P6YDs].

- **Patient education**: Educate patients about the risks of NSAID use and encourage reporting of symptoms such as edema, decreased urine output, or fatigue [^112iWAFa].

---

NSAIDs are **contraindicated in patients with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²** because of the high risk of AKI, electrolyte disturbances, and CKD progression. In patients with eGFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m², NSAIDs should be avoided if possible; if necessary, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration with close monitoring. Alternative analgesics such as acetaminophen and topical NSAIDs should be considered to minimize renal risks.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Avoid concomitant use with aliskiren in patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 60. (7.1)
Potassium-sparing diuretics: May lead to increased serum potassium. (7.2)
Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs): May lead to increased risk of renal impairment. (7.3)
Lithium: Increased risk of lithium toxicity. (7.4)

7.1 Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System

Concomitant use of ENTRESTO with an ACE inhibitor is contraindicated because of the increased risk of angioedema [see Contraindications (4)].

Avoid use of ENTRESTO with an ARB, because ENTRESTO contains the angiotensin II receptor blocker valsartan.

The concomitant use of ENTRESTO with aliskiren is contraindicated in patients with diabetes [see Contraindications (4)]. Avoid use with aliskiren in patients with renal impairment (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2).

7.2 Potassium-Sparing Diuretics

As with other drugs that block angiotensin II or its effects, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride), potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increases in serum potassium [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

7.3 Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors)

In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, concomitant use of NSAIDs, including COX-2 inhibitors, with ENTRESTO may result in worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically.

7.4 Lithium

Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin II receptor antagonists. Monitor serum lithium levels during concomitant use with ENTRESTO.

### Consensus about managing gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs? [^112aprUe]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Thus, clinicians and their patients face some dilemmas about how to balance the GI and CV risks, especially in patients known to be at increased risk for both, as occurs in many elderly patients. Cryer, in a submission on behalf of consumers to a 2014 FDA hearing that was contemplating a labeling change based solely on CV risk, emphasized the need for a comprehensive risk assessment: ' In the process of addressing cardiovascular health in the setting of NSAID use, which we applaud, we would not want you to inadvertently increase the risk of other untoward outcomes associated with NSAIDs, such as GI and renal toxicities '.

It is timely to review the area; thus, in a recent article published in BMC Medicine, Scarpignato et al. report on a recent consensus meeting that has updated earlier guidelines using more recent information.

### Clinical practice guideline on pregnancy and renal disease [^111MdUsT]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Guideline 4.10.1

We recommend that non-steroidal anti-inflammatories should not be given (1C).

Rationale

Given that the risk of renal side effects from short-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in patients without pre-existing risk factors is considered to be rare, NSAIDs are currently recommended in the postpartum period for perineal pain when paracetamol provides insufficient relief of symptoms. Although the risk profile of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is considered to be different in CKD, evidence supporting this is mixed. Historical case-control studies show an increased rate of kidney injury and progression to end stage renal disease in patients taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In contrast, data from older-age cohorts taking high-dose NSAIDS are conflicting, Questionnaire data from a female cohort showed no measurable association between NSAID use and renal function decline over 11 years, although the mean eGFR at study commencement was 88 ml/min/1.73m 2. There are no data examining non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use in women of reproductive age with risk factors for renal disease progression, in the context of peripartum haemodynamic change. The guideline committee therefore endorses existing recommendations that NSAIDs should be contraindicated in women with a (pre-pregnancy) eGFR < 30mls/min/1.73m 2 (estimated to be equivalent to serum creatinine > 150 μmol/L in pregnancy), and should be avoided where possible in all those with renal impairment due to the possibility of sodium and water retention and a deterioration in renal function.

### Prime time for chronic kidney disease [^115E3eFa]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Risks and challenges with diagnosis

Although screening for CKD has not yet been advocated by The Unites States Preventative Services Task Force, screening is recommended for patients with increased risk by several kidney organizations, including the National Kidney Foundation in the United States. Appropriate groups for screening include age over 60 years and older, presence of diabetes and hypertension, family history of diabetes, hypertension or kidney disease, and previous history of acute kidney injury and certain ethnic and racial minorities. There are numerous other causes of CKD including tubulointerstitial diseases, post-obstructive uropathies, cystic/genetic glomerular diseases, use of nephrotoxic medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), obesity, and social determinants of health that impact access to care. Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines recommend screening for proteinuria in all patients with CKD. Current trends in proteinuria screening in CKD have improved but continue to vary widely, noted to be between 10 and 45% in one large health care system in the US. Using serum creatinine levels, a raceless calculation of estimated GFR based on the CKD-EPI Creatinine Eq. (2021) is recommended by the National Kidney Foundation. The National Kidney Foundation and The American Society of Nephrology recently lead a task force to look at the formula to estimate GFR and have identified race as a social construct and not appropriate to be part of the estimated GFR equation. This can lead to overestimation of GFR in Blacks and result in delayed referral for kidney transplant evaluation or for referral to nephrology. Again, the joint task force recommends use of the 2021 CKD Epidemiology Collaboration creatinine equation without race. The task force also recommends using cystatin C when appropriate or needed to accurately determine the estimated GFR. Universal use of cystatin C was not recommended due to lack of availability in all healthcare settings and the prohibitive cost for large scale screenings. Measuring albuminuria via the ACR is appropriate to help classify the stages of CKD.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy in patients with hypertension, cardiovascular, renal or gastrointestinal comorbidities: joint APAGE / APLAR / APSDE / APSH / APSN / PoA recommendations [^111X1Brb]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are one of the most commonly prescribed medications, but they are associated with a number of serious adverse effects, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, kidney injury and GI complications.

Objective

To develop a set of multidisciplinary recommendations for the safe prescription of NSAIDs.

Methods

Randomised control trials and observational studies published before January 2018 were reviewed, with 329 papers included for the synthesis of evidence-based recommendations.

Results

Whenever possible, a NSAID should be avoided in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension, high risk of cardiovascular disease and severe chronic kidney disease (CKD). Before treatment with a NSAID is started, blood pressure should be measured, unrecognised CKD should be screened in high risk cases, and unexplained iron-deficiency anaemia should be investigated. For patients with high cardiovascular risk, and if NSAID treatment cannot be avoided, naproxen or celecoxib are preferred. For patients with a moderate risk of peptic ulcer disease, monotherapy with a non-selective NSAID plus a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), or a selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor should be used; for those with a high risk of peptic ulcer disease, a selective COX-2 inhibitor plus PPI are needed. For patients with pre-existing hypertension receiving renin-angiotensin system blockers, empirical addition (or increase in the dose) of an antihypertensive agent of a different class should be considered. Blood pressure and renal function should be monitored in most cases.

Conclusion

NSAIDs are a valuable armamentarium in clinical medicine, but appropriate recognition of high-risk cases, selection of a specific agent, choice of ulcer prophylaxis and monitoring after therapy are necessary to minimise the risk of adverse events.

### Abstract… [^112sSccL]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

6 Some medications, such as beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, may increase NSAID-related renal complications. 2, 5 When possible, NSAIDs should be avoided in persons with preexisting renal disease, congestive heart failure, or cirrhosis to prevent acute renal failure. 6, 23. Care should be used when prescribing NSAIDs in persons with an increased risk of renal complications. Some physician groups have proposed monitoring of renal function after initiation of NSAIDs in persons at risk of renal failure, including obtaining a baseline serum creatinine level when starting therapy. Also, some recommend that high-risk persons and persons taking other medications that might decrease renal function, such as ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, be monitored as often as once weekly for three weeks after initiation of therapy. 6 However, it is unclear whether such monitoring improves morbidity or mortality.

HEMATOLOGIC Because NSAIDs have antiplatelet effects, they should be avoided in persons with preexisting platelet defects or thrombocytopenia. The antiplatelet effects of NSAIDs should be considered in the perioperative setting. For high-risk persons who have had a recent myocardial infarction or recent placement of a cardiac stent, aspirin should be continued before and after surgery. 26 When NSAIDs are combined with anticoagulants there is a significantly increased risk of GI bleeding because of interactions, which can increase the International Normalized Ratio by up to 15 percent. This is in addition to the direct antiplatelet effects of NSAIDs. When it is necessary to start NSAID therapy in persons taking anticoagulants, an increase in INR should be anticipated. There should be appropriate INR monitoring and warfarin dosage adjustments, and GI prophylaxis should be initiated.

Potential maternal effects when NSAIDs are used close to term include prolonged gestation and labor from inhibition of pros-taglandin synthesis, increased peripartum blood loss, and increased anemia. Potential fetal effects close to term include increased cutaneous and intracranial bleeding, premature closure of ductus arteriosus, pulmonary hypertension, impaired renal function, reduced urine output, and reduced amniotic fluid volume. These effects have been demonstrated with indomethacin, naproxen, ketoprofen, and ibuprofen. The dose, duration, and period of gestation are all potential factors in these effects.

### Practice advisory on the appropriate use of NSAIDs in primary care [^111XtF2K]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

In patients with a history of renal impairment, congestive heart failure, elevated BP and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus, or the presence of unexplained anemia, consider a complete blood count and assessment of renal function prior to initiating an NSAID.

Patients at high risk of NSAID-associated adverse events may be stratified according to GI, CV and renal risk. Patients considered to be at high GI risk are those with age greater than 65 years, use of high-dose NSAIDs, history of peptic ulcer and related complications, and concurrent use of aspirin, anti-platelet therapy or anti-coagulant therapy (and especially patients receiving double anti-platelet therapy). Patients at high CV risk are those with a history of acute coronary syndrome or percutaneous/surgical coronary revascularization, stable angina and angiographic evidence of significant coronary artery stenosis, a history of stroke/transient ischemic attack, documented significant carotid artery stenosis, or congestive heart failure. Patients at high renal risk are those with age greater than 75 years, impaired renal function based on estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min, and concomitant administration of an antihypertensive from any of the diuretic, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) classes. Analgesics such as paracetamol, tramadol or codeine may be used in place of NSAIDs if the risks of NSAID treatment outweigh the potential benefits. However, the efficacy, availability and potential adverse effects of these alternatives also need to be considered in any decision-making regarding appropriate analgesia.

Choice of NSAIDs

All oral nonselective NSAIDs and COX-2 selective inhibitors have analgesic effects of a similar magnitude, but differences may exist among individual drugs in terms of potential GI, CV, renal or liver toxicities.

This statement was a point of contention among the group and represents a compromise from the original statement, which was formulated as: GI protective therapies are generally inadequate or inappropriate in NSAID users. Consensus was not formed for this statement, necessitating rephrasing of the statement to the above wording (Level of agreement: strongly agree, 21%; agree, 43%; consensus, 64% [not reached]). In line with the revision, the group agreed that GI protective therapies (eg, PPIs) benefit patients who require an NSAID and who have a moderate to high risk for upper GI complications. There is little or no evidence to support any protection against lower GI side effects.

### Estimated GFR reporting is associated with decreased nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug prescribing and increased renal function [^111UC1v7]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

The main strength of this study is its population-based cohort design, with complete regional biochemistry data, which is unique. However, the study has some limitations. First, the study was confined to a single National Health Service (NHS) region, and it is possible that the association between NSAID prescribing and CKD reporting may be different in other regions. A further study such as a questionnaire survey of physician behavior would strengthen the study finding. Second, the study period was historical. We do not know whether the prescribing behaviors in recent years were sustained or accelerated or lapsed. A follow-up study would be able to answer this question. Third, the estimated eGFR did not correct for ethnicity because we did not have this information. However, 97% of Tayside population are Caucasians, and therefore this is unlikely to have been a major confounder. This is unlikely to be a major source of misclassification. Fourth, unmeasured risk factors and confounders may have biased the use of NSAIDs. However, we have previously shown little impact of unmeasured risk factors and confounders in the same population. Finally, we did not use a reference method for assessing glomerular function.

In conclusion, introduction of eGFR reporting may result in safer prescribing of NSAIDs in primary care.

### Paget's disease of bone: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113RTDfv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Medium credibility.

Paget's disease of bone — zoledronate safety, renal thresholds, and vitamin D precautions include frequent acute-phase symptoms and specific contraindications. Zoledronate has a satisfactory safety profile with a flu-like illness in about 25% of patients, and the frequency and severity of these reactions is reduced by about one-half with acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs used prophylactically. Uveitis and other inflammatory eye changes occur in approximately 1% of patients receiving zoledronate, require prompt ophthalmologic attention, and resolve rapidly and completely with topical steroids. Zoledronate is potentially nephrotoxic and should not be administered if the glomerular filtration rate is < 35 mL/min; although some physicians use lower doses and longer infusion times in marginal renal function, this has not been approved by regulatory agencies. Potent bisphosphonates can produce symptomatic hypocalcemia in marked vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D < 25 nmol/L), so supplementation before treatment is advisable, and a single, large, oral dose of calciferol, 100 000 U, appears to be satisfactory.

### Kidney function monitoring to prevent 5-aminosalicylic acid nephrotoxicity: what the gastroenterologist should know [^114MJeGR]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The kidney function monitoring is recommended in routine practice to detect 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) related nephrotoxicity, although is not standardized. The optimal monitoring is unknown, especially the best timing and which tests to perform. We summarized why, how, and when to perform the monitoring for patients treated with 5-ASA and provided an overview of the current guidelines on this topic.

Method

Relevant studies on this topic were searched in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases from July to August 2020.

Results

Serum creatinine, the estimated glomerular filtration rate, and 24-h proteinuria are the 3 main tests used for the monitoring in daily practice. Regarding the timing, several monitoring strategies have been proposed and guidelines are available too, but they provide conflicting information. To date, there is no medical evidence-based that one strategy is better than another. Comorbidities, chronic renal disease, use of nephrotoxic drugs or concomitant steroid therapy also impact the nephrotoxicity risk. Based on the literature review we proposed a kidney function monitoring strategy to guide physicians in clinical practice.

Conclusion

A baseline assessment should be performed in all patients treated with 5-ASA. The monitoring should be carried out according to the other nephrotoxic factors. A tight monitoring may reduce morbidity and mortality of drug nephrotoxicity.

### Celecoxib (ELYXYB-celecoxib) [^1133M63i]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Elderly patients, compared to younger patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions. If the anticipated benefit for the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks, treat for the fewest number of days per month, as needed, and monitor patients for adverse effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.6, 5.15)].

In the controlled clinical trials for migraine, approximately 70 patients were ≥ 65 years of age. Of the total number of patients who received celecoxib (for indications other than migraine) in pre-approval clinical trials, more than 3,300 were 65–74 years of age, while approximately 1,300 additional patients were 75 years and over. No substantial differences in effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. In clinical studies comparing renal function as measured by the GFR, BUN and creatinine, and platelet function as measured by bleeding time and platelet aggregation, the results were not different between elderly and young volunteers.

However, as with other NSAIDs, including those that selectively inhibit COX-2, there have been more spontaneous postmarketing reports of fatal GI events and acute renal failure in the elderly than in younger patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.6)].

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

No dosage adjustment is needed for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A). Reduce the dose of ELYXYB in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The use of ELYXYB in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) is not recommended.

8.7 Renal Impairment

No dosage adjustment is needed for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. ELYXYB is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.8 Poor Metabolizers of CYP2C9 Substrates

In patients who are known or suspected to be poor CYP2C9 metabolizers (i.e. CYP2C9✱3/✱3), based on genotype or previous history/experience with other CYP2C9 substrates (e.g., warfarin, phenytoin) reduce the dose of ELYXYB [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].

### Specific cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors: what have we learned since they came into widespread clinical use? [^115DDHmb]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Specific inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2 were introduced into widespread clinical use in 1999. Since that time, celecoxib and rofecoxib have become two of the most commonly prescribed medications in the United States. Clinical trials using these medications for arthritis and pain have uniformly demonstrated efficacy superior to that of placebo and similar to that of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. However, controversy surrounding the proper place of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors in the hierarchy of treatment for arthritis continues, based primarily on their higher cost compared with that of acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. A decreased risk of gastrointestinal toxicity remains the primary justification for using the more expensive cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors in preference to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The renal and cardiovascular effects of rofecoxib and celecoxib have been investigated in relation to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and to one another. The data with respect to alteration in renal function, lower extremity edema, and hypertension indicates that cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors affect the kidney in a manner similar to that of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The data comparing the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors is difficult to interpret because it is not clear that comparable doses have been used in clinical trials. The potential thrombogenic risk of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors remains controversial, and conflicting data exist. It remains important to increase our understanding of the place of these agents in clinical practice from the perspective of efficacy, toxicity, and cost.

### Ketorolac tromethamine (Acunivive 15) [^1164eUrM]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Impaired Renal Function

Ketorolac tromethamine is contraindicated in patients with serum creatinine concentrations indicating advanced renal impairment (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Ketorolac tromethamine should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function or a history of kidney disease because it is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis. Because patients with underlying renal insufficiency are at increased risk of developing acute renal decompensation or failure, the risks and benefits should be assessed prior to giving ketorolac tromethamine to these patients.

Anaphylactoid Reactions

As with other NSAIDs, anaphylactoid reactions may occur in patients without known prior exposure to ketorolac tromethamine. Ketorolac tromethamine should not be given to patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically occurs in asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS, Pre-existing Asthma). Emergency help should be sought in cases where an anaphylactoid reaction occurs.

Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events

Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.

There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as ketorolac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events (see WARNINGS).

KDIGO 2024 CKD — hyperuricemia recommendations and practice points state that "We recommend people with CKD and symptomatic hyperuricemia should be offered uric acid–lowering intervention (1C)". Practice Point 3.14.1 advises to "Consider initiating urate acid-lowering therapy for people with CKD after their first episode of gout… serum uric acid concentration is > 9 mg/dl [535 μmol/l])". Practice Point 3.14.2 directs to "Prefer xanthine oxidase inhibitors in preference to uricosuric agents in people with CKD and symptomatic hyperuricemia". Practice Point 3.14.3 notes that "low-dose colchicine or intra-articular/oral glucocorticoids are preferable to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)", and Practice Point 3.14.4 adds that "Nonpharmacological interventions… include limiting alcohol, meats, and high-fructose corn syrup intake". Additionally, "We suggest not using agents to lower serum uric acid in people with CKD and asymptomatic hyperuricemia to delay CKD progression (2D)".

### Renal effects of cyclooxygyenase-2-selective inhibitors [^111wT3bX]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2002). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used. These agents are associated with adverse renal effects caused by the reduction in synthesis of renal prostaglandins through inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX). Both isoforms of COX, COX-1 and COX-2, are expressed in the kidney in constitutive and inducible forms. It is assumed therefore that the COX-2-selective inhibitors, rofecoxib and celecoxib, would have an effect on renal function similar to that of nonselective NSAIDs. Several studies have evaluated this issue, although they have different study models and some have design flaws that limit their interpretation. Therefore, conclusions should be based on the pattern of observed effects rather than on individual data. These studies suggest that both celecoxib and rofecoxib can cause sodium retention and decrease glomerular filtration rate (GFR) to a similar extent as nonselective NSAIDs in patients at risk for adverse renal effects. Consequently, the same precautions regarding renal risk that are followed for nonselective NSAIDs should be used when selective COX-2 inhibitors are administered.

### Celecoxib (Vyscoxa) [^115diMsY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Elderly patients, compared to younger patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions. If the anticipated benefit for the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks, start dosing at the low end of the dosing range, and monitor patients for adverse effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.6, 5.14)].

Of the total number of patients who received celecoxib in pre-approval clinical trials, more than 3,300 were 65–74 years of age, while approximately 1,300 additional patients were 75 years and over. No substantial differences in effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. In clinical studies comparing renal function as measured by the GFR, BUN and creatinine, and platelet function as measured by bleeding time and platelet aggregation, the results were not different between elderly and young volunteers. However, as with other NSAIDs, including those that selectively inhibit COX-2, there have been more spontaneous post-marketing reports of fatal GI events and acute renal failure in the elderly than in younger patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.6)].

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

The daily recommended dose of VYSCOXA oral suspension in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) should be reduced by 50%. The use of VYSCOXA in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 Renal Impairment

VYSCOXA is not recommended in patients with severe renal insufficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.8 Poor Metabolizers of CYP2C9 Substrates

In patients who are known or suspected to be poor CYP2C9 metabolizers (i.e. CYP2C9✱3/✱3), based on genotype or previous history/experience with other CYP2C9 substrates (such as warfarin, phenytoin) administer VYSCOXA starting with half the lowest recommended dose. Alternative management should be considered in JRA patients identified to be CYP2C9 poor metabolizers [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].

### Folinic acid prophylaxis and dose adjustments enable safe treatment with pemetrexed in patients with renal impairment [^116mWBvF]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study population

All patients with an indication for pemetrexed‐containing therapy, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or creatinine clearance < 45 mL/min, and willing to provide written informed consent were eligible for inclusion. Concomitant use of non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was not permitted during treatment with pemetrexed as per local protocols.

Study design

The presented IMPROVE‐I was a sub‐study from the IMPROVE‐study (ZonMW grant number 848016010) that aimed at optimizing pemetrexed treatment. Whereas the IMPROVE‐I was a study for patients with renal impairment, the IMPROVE‐II was a randomized study that investigated the feasibility of individualized versus standard dosing in patients with normal renal function (NCT03655821).

We performed a renal impairment study compliant with EMA and FDA guidance for clinical studies in renal impairment, to obtain a practice‐changing level of evidence. The main endpoints for this study were safety and pharmacokinetics, as these guidelines state that a dosing recommendation for impaired renal function should aim at the majority of patients being in the target range based on the therapeutic dose in the pivotal trial population (thus patients with normal renal function). We used a 3 + 3 intraindividual dose escalation design, commonly used for oncology trials to safely escalate the dose of cytotoxic drugs. The toxicity was graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5. A DLT was defined as a grade IV or higher hematological toxicity or any grade III or higher non‐hematological toxicity. The study was performed in Radboudumc Nijmegen, Catharina Hospital Eindhoven, and the Jeroen Bosch Hospital in Den Bosch, the Netherlands (identifier is NCT03656549) and was performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee Oost‐Nederland in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, under registration number NL65481.091.18.

### Estimated GFR reporting is associated with decreased nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug prescribing and increased renal function [^112bSHZ2]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used; however, they are also nephrotoxic with both acute and chronic effects on kidney function. Here we determined NSAID prescribing before and after estimated GFR (eGFR) reporting and evaluate renal function in patients who used NSAIDs but stopped these after their first eGFR report. A population-based longitudinal analysis using a record-linkage database was conducted with the GFR estimated using the four-variable equation from the MDRD study and analyzed by trend test, paired t-test, and logistic regression modeling. Prescriptions for NSAIDs significantly decreased from 39,459 to 35,415 after implementation of eGFR reporting from the second quarter of 2005 compared with the first quarter of 2007. Reporting eGFR was associated with reduced NSAID prescriptions (adjusted odds ratio, 0.78). NSAID prescription rates in the 6 months before April 2006 were 18.8, 15.4, and 7.0% in patients with CKD stages 3, 4, and 5 and 15.5, 10.7, and 6.3%, respectively, after eGFR reporting commenced. In patients who stopped NSAID treatment, eGFR significantly increased from 45.9 to 46.9, 23.9 to 27.1, and 12.4 to 26.4ml/min per 1.73m(2) in 1340 stage 3 patients, 162 stage 4 patients, and 9 stage 5 patients, respectively. Thus, NSAID prescribing decreased after the implementation of eGFR reporting, and there were significant improvements in estimated renal function in patients who stopped taking NSAIDs. Hence, eGFR reporting may result in safer prescribing.

NSAIDs — use as first-line therapy, dosing strategy, and contraindications in austere environments — Recommendation: We recommend NSAIDs as an effective class of analgesic agents that should be employed as a first-line treatment for mild to severe pain in the austere environment in the absence of contraindications. Recommendation: We recommend that treatment strategies with NSAIDs should employ the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration to minimize adverse effects. Recommendation: We recommend that NSAIDs should not be used with known renal dysfunction, pregnancy, history of bariatric surgery, and/or history of GI bleeding. Topical NSAIDs, though proven to be effective analgesics, have a limited role in the treatment of significant injury in austere environments, given the increased weight, bulk, and limited stability of these preparations.

Of the total number of patients who received celecoxib in pre-approval clinical trials, more than 3,300 were 65 to 74 years of age, while approximately 1,300 additional patients were 75 years and over. No substantial differences in effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects.

8.6 Hepatic Insufficiency

The daily recommended dose of celecoxib capsules in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) should be reduced by 50%. The use of celecoxib in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 Renal Insufficiency

Celecoxib is not recommended in patients with severe renal insufficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.8 Poor Metabolizers of CYP2C9 Substrates

Patients who are known or suspected to be poor CYP2C9 metabolizers based on genotype or previous history/experience with other CYP2C9 substrates (such as warfarin, phenytoin) should be administered celecoxib with caution. Consider starting treatment at half the lowest recommended dose in poor metabolizers (i.e. CYP2C9✱3/✱3). Alternative management should be considered in JRA patients identified to be CYP2C9 poor metabolizers [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the non-surgical management of hip&knee osteoarthritis [^1163C3kU]. DoD/VA (2020). High credibility.

Non-surgical management of hip & knee osteoarthritis — clinical summary and recommendation state that the evidence supports a clinically significant reduction in pain with NSAIDs and a lesser overall effect of reducing pain with acetaminophen in patients with OA of the hip or knee; the superiority of NSAIDs over acetaminophen was more apparent in patients with moderate-to-severe baseline pain, while differences were negligible in milder disease or symptoms. Therefore, providers should carefully consider the medical history of patients being considered for such therapy, and providers should avoid offering this treatment to patients with comorbidities that increase their risk for adverse events (e.g. CKD [chronic kidney disease], especially severe CKD, at risk for or known CVD, at risk for NSAID-related upper GI events). Adverse events associated with the use of acetaminophen appear to be dose-related, the Work Group's confidence in the quality of evidence was low, and avoidance of NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors is suggested in patients with certain comorbidities, leading to a "Weak for" recommendation.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^112iWAFa]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

NSAID-induced kidney injury risk in CKD and general populations — observational and meta-analytic data: Observational studies demonstrate that nephrotoxic risks of NSAIDs are modest, somewhat predictable, and may be less than risks associated with alternative medications. Patients at higher risk for acute kidney injury (AKI) include those with heart failure, cirrhosis, CKD, or dehydration, and those on RAASi, diuretics, or calcineurin inhibitors. In non-CKD populations, studies are conflicting, with some finding no association with incident CKD and others showing increased relative risk with risk generally increasing based on intensity or duration of NSAID exposure; although larger recent studies show a consistent trend toward increased incident CKD, the absolute risks are small when reported. One report demonstrated an excess of 17 CKD events per 100,000 exposed Active-Duty U.S. service members. In patients with pre-existing CKD, a meta-analysis supported increased risk of NSAID-associated AKI with HR of 1.7 and an absolute risk of 4% in NSAID exposed versus non-exposed individuals; however, individual trial estimates varied by an order of magnitude (e.g. OR: 1.05 to 5.25), so pooled averages should be interpreted with skepticism.

### Sacubitril and valsartan [^115QeFvZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

- Avoid concomitant use with aliskiren in patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 60. (7.1)

- **Potassium-sparing diuretics**: May lead to increased serum potassium. (7.2)

- **Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)**: May lead to increased risk of renal impairment. (7.3)

- **Lithium**: Increased risk of lithium toxicity. (7.4)

7.1 Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System

Concomitant use of sacubitril and valsartan with an ACE inhibitor is contraindicated because of the increased risk of angioedema [see Contraindications (4)]. Avoid use of sacubitril and valsartan with an ARB, because sacubitril and valsartan contains the angiotensin II receptor blocker valsartan.

The concomitant use of sacubitril and valsartan with aliskiren is contraindicated in patients with diabetes [see Contraindications (4)]. Avoid use with aliskiren in patients with renal impairment (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2).

7.2 Potassium-Sparing Diuretics

As with other drugs that block angiotensin II or its effects, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride), potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increases in serum potassium [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

7.3 Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors)

In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, concomitant use of NSAIDs, including COX-2 inhibitors, with sacubitril and valsartan may result in worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically.

7.4 Lithium

Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin II receptor antagonists. Monitor serum lithium levels during concomitant use with sacubitril and valsartan.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: management of osteoarthritis of the knee (nonarthroplasty), third edition [^115NtE77]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

AAOS knee osteoarthritis — oral acetaminophen is recommended to improve pain and function in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis when not contraindicated (Strength of Recommendation: Strong). Evidence cited indicates oral acetaminophen consistently improved pain and function compared to controls, with meta-analysis showing a meaningful reduction in pain and improved function with no evidence of confounding heterogeneity, and overall it is considered a safe medication with no evidence of significantly increased adverse events among the included studies; however, the United States FDA has a black-box warning for acetaminophen secondary to concern of overdose leading to hepatotoxicity or death. When oral acetaminophen was compared to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), the use of oral NSAIDs provided a significant reduction in pain and improved function, and as a result, providers may consider using oral NSAIDs instead of acetaminophen when a contraindication to oral NSAIDs does not exist in the patient. Implementation guidance notes that although oral acetaminophen is widely used, providers must recognize the specific risks associated with each medication and that specific patient contraindications need to be assessed on an individual basis (example: renal failure). Outcome considerations include that the most important consideration will be removal of oral narcotics from medications prescribed for osteoarthritis of the knee, which becomes particularly significant due to the rise of the opioid epidemic in the United States. Cost-effectiveness remains undetermined to date, acetaminophen is commonly utilized so there should be no issues implementing this recommendation, and this recommendation may be implemented immediately having a potential positive impact in clinical practice.

### Practice advisory on the appropriate use of NSAIDs in primary care [^111NimAT]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Renal Risks

In addition to the GI and CV effects of NSAIDs, epidemiological and pathologic data also associate NSAID use with the potential for both acute and chronic kidney disease (CKD).–Renal side effects which include sodium and water retention with edema, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acute kidney injury may precipitate renal failure resulting in acute dialysis. Risk factors include older age, renal impairment, heart failure, liver disease, diabetes mellitus (DM), and concurrent prescription with antihypertensive drugs (eg, diuretics, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors). Again, mechanisms of NSAID-induced kidney damage relate to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis and are dose- and duration-dependent. Low levels of COX-2 are constitutively expressed in the macula densa, with COX-2 inhibition leading to a reduction in renal blood flow and resulting functional impairment. NSAIDs may also accumulate in renal tubular cells during secretion. While NSAID-induced sodium retention is COX-2-mediated, NSAID-induced reductions in glomerular filtration rate are mediated via COX-1.

Consistent with the dual COX-1/COX-2-dependent mechanisms, which predict the possibility of differences in renal toxicity for different NSAIDs, there are limited data to suggest clinically relevant differences. In the MEDAL program, etoricoxib had a greater risk of renovascular adverse events than diclofenac. In PRECISION, the risk of renal events was significantly lower with celecoxib compared with ibuprofen, and was similar for celecoxib compared with naproxen. In a meta-analysis, NSAIDs with high COX-2 selectivity had a lower association with acute kidney injury (AKI) compared to NSAIDs with low COX-2 selectivity. Overall, NSAIDs have a low but tangible risk in causing AKI, electrolyte imbalances and increased BP, but their role in progressive kidney disease is associated only with long-term use in high cumulative doses. In patients with CKD, withdrawal of NSAID use is recommended by nephrology consensus groups, but initiation of alternatives such as opioids conveys different and no less important drug-related concerns. In a study conducted in China that included age- and sex-matched controls of NSAID users, long-term (≥ 48 months) use of NSAIDs was independently associated with reduced renal function. It is recommended that patients with risk factors for renal impairment have preventative strategies in place that include using the lowest effective NSAID dose for the shortest possible time, as well as monitoring renal function, fluid retention and electrolyte abnormalities. The concomitant use of NSAIDs and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should be avoided.

### Effects of peri-operative nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on post-operative kidney function for adults with normal kidney function [^11592NKf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) provide effective analgesia during the post-operative period but can cause acute kidney injury (AKI) when used peri-operatively (at or around the time of surgery). This is an update of a Cochrane review published in 2007.

Objectives

This review looked at the effect of NSAIDs used in the peri-operative period on post-operative kidney function in patients with normal kidney function.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register to 4 January 2018 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Specialised Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (RCTs in which allocation to treatment was obtained by alternation, use of alternate medical records, date of birth or other predictable methods) looking at the use of NSAIDs versus placebo for the treatment of post-operative pain in patients with normal kidney function were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data extraction was carried out independently by two authors as was assessment of risk of bias. Disagreements were resolved by a third author. Dichotomous outcomes are reported as relative risk (RR) and continuous outcomes as mean difference (MD) together with their 95% confidence intervals (CI). Meta-analyses were used to assess the outcomes of AKI, change in serum creatinine (SCr), urine output, renal replacement therapy (RRT), death (all causes) and length of hospital stay.

Main Results

We identified 26 studies (8835 participants). Risk of bias was high in 17, unclear in 6and low in three studies. There was high risk of attrition bias in six studies. Only two studies measured AKI. The use of NSAIDs had uncertain effects on the incidence of AKI compared to placebo (7066 participants: RR 1.79, 95% CI 0.40 to 7.96; I² = 59%; very low certainty evidence). One study was stopped early by the data monitoring committee due to increased rates of AKI in the NSAID group. Moreover, both of these studies were examining NSAIDs for indications other than analgesia and therefore utilised relatively low doses. Compared to placebo, NSAIDs may slightly increase serum SCr (15 studies, 794 participants: MD 3.23 μmol/L, 95% CI -0.80 to 7.26; I² = 63%; low certainty evidence). Studies displayed moderate to high heterogeneity and had multiple exclusion criteria including age and so were not representative of patients undergoing surgery. Three of these studies excluded patients if their creatinine rose post-operatively.NSAIDs may make little or no difference to post-operative urine output compared to placebo (6 studies, 149 participants: SMD -0.02, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.27). No reliable conclusions could be drawn from these studies due to the differing units of measurements and measurement time points. It is uncertain whether NSAIDs leads to the need for RRT because the certainty of this evidence is very low (2 studies, 7056 participants: RR 1.57, 95% CI 0.49 to 5.07; I² = 26%); there were few events and the results were inconsistent. It is uncertain whether NSAIDs lead to more deaths (2 studies, 312 participants: RR 1.44, 95% CI 0.19 to 11.12; I² = 38%) or increased the length of hospital stay (3 studies, 410 participants: MD 0.12 days, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.72; I² = 24%).

Authors' Conclusions

Overall NSAIDs had uncertain effects on the risk of post-operative AKI, may slightly increase post-operative SCr, and it is uncertain whether NSAIDs lead to the need for RRT, death or increases the length of hospital stay. The available data therefore does not confirm the safety of NSAIDs in patients undergoing surgery. Further larger studies using the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes definition for AKI including patients with co-morbidities are required to confirm these findings.

### Ibuprofen [^112QjFzU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulcerations and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high-risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.

Renal Effects

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

Advanced Renal Disease

No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of ibuprofen tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. Therefore, treatment with ibuprofen tablets is not recommended in these patients with advanced renal disease. If ibuprofen tablet therapy must be initiated, close monitoring of the patients renal function is advisable.

DISCUSSION

We observed a decrease in NSAID prescribing in Tayside after eGFR reporting was introduced on 1 April 2006. eGFR reporting was not associated with decline in the use of other cardiovascular drugs, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor-blocking drugs. Our study provides evidence that eGFR reporting was associated with improved estimates of renal function in patients who stopped NSAID treatment. By providing additional information, in addition to serum creatinine, eGFR reporting may provide additional renal benefit and reduced prescribing of NSAIDs in primary care.

CKD and NSAID use in elderly people are major challenges to health-care systems with aging populations. CKD is a risk factor for multiple adverse outcomes such as kidney failure, cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment, and death. However, despite the importance of recognizing CKD, it may be missed when serum creatinine alone is used as a marker of renal function, because of confounders, including muscle mass, age, sex, and ethnicity; eGFR reporting was introduced mainly in recognition of this. NSAIDS are known to affect renal function most likely by inhibiting renal prostaglandin production, an effect that is modified by factors such as sodium status. NSAIDs, except aspirin, should generally be avoided in CKD patients if possible. However, in practice, patients with CKD are likely to be older and to have multiple comorbid conditions or symptoms that lead to increased use of NSAIDs. NSAIDs have been associated with acute kidney injury and disease progression in those with CKD, leading to sodium retention, edema, hypertension, and hyperkalemia. Therefore, it is important to monitor renal function in patients taking NSAIDs. Previous studies have shown that early recognition, intervention, and management of patients with CKD by physicians lead to slow progression of the disease and disease complications. However, a recent American survey showed that among patients with CKD stage ⩾3, NSAIDs were prescribed in 5% of patients, and that awareness of the association between NSAIDs and kidney disease was not associated with reduced NSAID use (3.8% aware vs. 3.9% unaware; P = 0.979). Our data suggest that awareness of CKD in patients prescribed NSAIDs increased after the introduction of eGFR reporting, and that the reduction in NSAID prescribing was associated with improvement in renal function in patients with CKD after they stopped taking NSAIDs. We observed a substantial improvement in eGFR in stage 5 patients. To clarify the clinical status of patients at the time of the estimates of GFR and to make sure the results were not affected by dialysis patients, we further reviewed the medical notes of stage 5 patients after the main analysis. The results of eGFR change in stage 5 patients after excluding the dialysis patients (n = 11) remained the same. This suggested that our findings were valid. Furthermore, within stage 5 patients, we observed decreased eGFRs between the eGFR before the date of the last NSAID prescription (within 2 months) and the eGFR after the date of last NSAID prescription (within 2 months), with a mean change of −4 ml/min per 1.73 m 2. This supports the evidence that NSAIDs are associated with a decreased renal function. Although only 9 patients were included in this group, similar results were also observed in a further sensitivity analysis that included 1380 patients in this group when using the closest eGFR after the last NSAID. eGFR reporting did not affect the community prescribing of diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers. This might be explained by the perceived antihypertensive and nephroprotective benefits of these drugs, resulting in clinicians being reluctant to discontinue them.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^11663mZo]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) route and duration — risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) and hyperkalemia in older adults and patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD): Observational analyses examining the first 30 days after a newly prescribed topical, short course (< 14 days), or longer course NSAID found in older adults that both topical (OR: 1.48) and short-course oral NSAIDs (OR: 1.59) were associated with increased risk at 30 days; a similar analysis reported adjusted odds for AKI or hyperkalemia at 30 days of 1.29 for topical NSAIDs, 1.43 for systemic NSAIDs of < 15 days, and 1.84 for systemic NSAIDs of ≥ 15 days, with incrementally higher odds with oral and prolonged administration. Among patients with CKD, topical and oral NSAIDs (compared with no NSAID prescription) were associated with AKI (OR: 1.38 and 1.77 respectively), and moderate and severe AKI were increased with oral NSAIDs but not topical NSAIDs. While each analysis attempted to control for confounders, it is unclear how much residual confounding by indication remains, and the literature suggests that the risk of adverse kidney outcomes is decreased (but likely not eliminated) by use of topical rather than oral NSAIDs.

### NSAIDs in CKD: are they safe? [^1137WjKP]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The management of pain in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is challenging for many reasons. These patients have increased susceptibility to adverse drug effects due to altered drug metabolism and excretion, and there are limited safety data for use in this population despite a high pain burden. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have long been regarded as dangerous for use in patients with CKD because of their risk for nephrotoxicity and thus alternative classes of analgesics, including opioids, have become more commonly used for pain control in this population. Given the well-established risks that opioids and other analgesics pose, further characterization of the risk posed by NSAIDs in patients with CKD is warranted. NSAID use has been associated with acute kidney injury, progressive loss of glomerular filtration rate in CKD, electrolyte derangements, and hypervolemia with worsening of heart failure and hypertension. The risk for these nephrotoxicity syndromes is modified by many comorbid conditions, risk factors, and characteristics of use, and in patients with CKD, the risk differs between levels of glomerular filtration rate. In this review, we offer recommendations for the cautious use of NSAIDs in the CKD population after careful consideration of these risk factors on an individualized basis.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug induced acute kidney injury in the community dwelling general population and people with chronic kidney disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112LvcVB]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

AKI is an increasingly common global problem causing significant morbidity and mortality and with large resource implications. Exposure to NSAIDS and other nephrotoxic drugs is an important cause of AKI, but the risk of these exposures is modified by susceptibilities such as increasing age and the presence of CKD. This study found that the odds of developing AKI increased by over 50% in people who were exposed to NSAIDs in the general population and in people with CKD, and in older people the odds of developing AKI doubled. However, the absolute risk of developing AKI also depends on the baseline risk of AKI in the population exposed, which none of the included studies reported. Future studies should use internationally agreed definitions of AKI and estimate the absolute risk of AKI in different populations including older people and people with CKD to better inform clinical decision making. There is evidence that feedback and more complex interventions to reduce NSAID prescribing in people at high risk of renal adverse effects are effective, and clinicians should seek to minimise NSAID exposure in people particularly susceptible to AKI due to age, CKD or because of the co-prescription of other nephrotoxic drugs.

### Determinants of impaired renal function with use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: the importance of half-life and other medications [^113ZT2Tc]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may interfere with renal function, but little is known about the effects of the half-life of these agents, or the use of other medications, on renal function.

Subjects and Methods

Medication use was assessed during a standardized interview in a cross-sectional study of 802 patients undergoing total joint replacement because of osteoarthritis. Preoperative blood samples were used to estimate creatinine clearance using a standard formula that takes age, sex, and weight into account. Impaired renal function was defined as an estimated creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/min (fifteenth percentile). Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between NSAID use (alone or in combination with diuretics or angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors) and impaired renal function.

Results

NSAID use per se was only marginally associated with impaired renal function (OR = 1.4; 95% CI, 0.9 to 2.2). This association was almost exclusively the result of the use of NSAIDs with a half-life of 4 or more hours (OR = 2.6; 95% CI: 1.2 to 5.7). Patients who used diuretics with NSAIDs (OR = 3.7; 95% CI: 1.7 to 8.3) or without NSAIDs (OR = 3.5; 95% CI: 1.6 to 7.6) had a higher risk of impaired renal function than did patients using NSAIDs alone (OR = 1.6) or none of these drugs (reference). A similar but less pronounced pattern was observed for ACE inhibitors.

Conclusion

NSAID-associated impaired renal function seems to be mainly the result of compounds with intermediate-long half-life. We found no evidence that the adverse effects of diuretics and ACE inhibitors on renal function were greater in those who also used NSAIDs.

### Estimated GFR reporting is associated with decreased nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug prescribing and increased renal function [^1141rhZs]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide public health problem with an increasing incidence and prevalence, particularly in elderly populations. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used in elderly populations. They are also nephrotoxic agents with both acute and chronic effects on kidney function. Previous studies have shown that NSAIDs are associated with a decrease in kidney function. Data from Scotland have shown a decrease in the use of NSAIDs over the period 2004–2008. In April 2006, the Scottish Renal Registry and the National Service Framework (NSF) recommended that reporting of creatinine measurements should be accompanied by an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The aims of this study were to determine NSAID prescribing before and after the implementation of eGFR reporting and to evaluate renal function in patients who used NSAIDs but stopped these after eGFR reporting was implemented.

Strategies listed are to "Assess personal and family history for bleeding diathesis", "Stop anticoagulants before the scheduled procedure" including "Stop aspirin at least 1 wk before procedure", "Stop nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents several days before (to ensure 4–5 half-lives have elapsed)", "Stop warfarin and consider switch to heparin in advance of procedure", and "Stop heparin before procedure". Pre-biopsy labs are specified: "Check complete blood count and coagulation parameters before biopsy" with "Bleeding time? — controversial". Kidney function checks are included: "Use equation to estimate GFR". For abnormal bleeding time and/or low GFR, "Consider administration of ddAVP", with dosing "0.3 μg/kg given in 50 mL of saline over 15–30 min immediately before procedure". Blood pressure control is addressed: "Control blood pressure on day of procedure" and "May give oral agents before procedure to decrease blood pressure".

### Celecoxib (celecoxib 50 mg) [^114oV9TQ]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the total number of patients who received celecoxib in pre-approval clinical trials, more than 3,300 were 65 to 74 years of age, while approximately 1,300 additional patients were 75 years and over. No substantial differences in effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. In clinical studies comparing renal function as measured by the GFR, BUN and creatinine, and platelet function as measured by bleeding time and platelet aggregation, the results were not different between elderly and young volunteers. However, as with other NSAIDs, including those that selectively inhibit COX-2, there have been more spontaneous post-marketing reports of fatal GI events and acute renal failure in the elderly than in younger patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.6)].

8.6 Hepatic Insufficiency

The daily recommended dose of celecoxib capsules in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) should be reduced by 50%. The use of celecoxib in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 Renal Insufficiency

Celecoxib is not recommended in patients with severe renal insufficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.8 Poor Metabolizers of CYP2C9 Substrates

Patients who are known or suspected to be poor CYP2C9 metabolizers based on genotype or previous history/experience with other CYP2C9 substrates (such as warfarin, phenytoin) should be administered celecoxib with caution. Consider starting treatment at half the lowest recommended dose in poor metabolizers (i.e. CYP2C9✱3/✱3). Alternative management should be considered in JRA patients identified to be CYP2C9 poor metabolizers [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].

### Effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on postoperative renal function in adults with normal renal function [^1143Fc86]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can play a major role in the management of acute pain in the peri-operative period. However, there are conflicting views on whether NSAIDs are associated with adverse renal effects.

Objectives

The primary objective of this review was to determine the effects of NSAIDs on postoperative renal function in adults with normal preoperative renal function.

Search Strategy

Electronic searches for relevant randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials in Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE and EMBASE were performed. Attempts were also made to identify trials from citation lists of relevant trials, review articles and clinical practice guidelines. Handsearching of conference abstracts published in major anaesthetic journals was also performed. Date of most recent search: May 2006

Selection Criteria

The inclusion criteria were randomised or quasi-randomised comparisons of individual NSAIDs with either each other or placebo for treatment of postoperative pain, with relevant postoperative renal outcome measures, in adult surgical patients with normal renal function.

Data Collection and Analysis

The data were extracted independently by two authors. The primary outcome measure was creatinine clearance within the first two days after surgery. Secondary outcome measures included serum creatinine, urine volume, urinary sodium level, urinary potassium level, fractional excretion of sodium, fractional excretion of potassium and need for dialysis. Weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes and relative risk (RR) and risk difference (RD) for dichotomous outcomes were estimated with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Twenty-three trials (1459 patients) fulfilled the selection criteria for this review. NSAIDs reduced creatinine clearance by 16 mL/min (95%CI 5 to 28) and potassium output by 38 mmol/day (95%CI 19 to 56) on the first day after surgery compared to placebo. There was no significant difference in serum creatinine on the first day (0 umol/L, 95%CI -3 to 4) compared to placebo. No significant reduction in urine volume during the early postoperative period was found. There was no significant difference in serum creatinine in the early postoperative period between patients receiving diclofenac, ketorolac, indomethacin, ketoprofen or etodolac. No cases of postoperative renal failure requiring dialysis were described. The trials were not heterogeneous for the primary outcome.

Authors' Conclusions

NSAIDs caused a clinically unimportant transient reduction in renal function in the early postoperative period in patients with normal preoperative renal function. NSAIDs should not be withheld from adults with normal preoperative renal function because of concerns about postoperative renal impairment.

### Estimated GFR reporting is associated with decreased nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug prescribing and increased renal function [^115ap9AD]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

Data were summarized as mean (s.d.)/median (interquartile range) for continuous variables and number of subjects (percent) for categorical variables. The χ 2, paired t -test, and analysis of variance tests were performed to determine significant differences. Rates of NSAID prescribing in CKD patients were compared between the users who did not get an eGFR report and who had an eGFR report (that is, before the implementation of eGFR reporting vs. after the implementation of eGFR reporting). Potential confounding by indication for eGFR reporting such as age, gender, socioeconomic status, comorbidity of diabetes, and use of diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers was adjusted for in a logistic regression model. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and chronic kidney disease progression: a systematic review [^114o9Sv7]. Family Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely regarded as one risk factor, which influences chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression. However, previous literature reviews have not quantified the risk in moderate to severe CKD patients.

Objective

To estimate the strength of association between chronic NSAID use and CKD progression.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational general practice or population studies featuring patients aged 45 years and over. The electronic databases searched were MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, AMED, BNI and CINAHL until September 2011 without date or language restrictions. Searches included the reference lists of relevant identified studies, WEB of KNOWLEDGE, openSIGLE, specific journals, the British Library and expert networks. For relevant studies, random effects meta-analysis was used to estimate the association between NSAID use and accelerated CKD progression (estimated glomerular filtration rate decline ≥ 15 ml/min/1.73 m2).

Results

From a possible 768 articles, after screening and selection, seven studies were identified (5 cohort, 1 case-control and 1 cross-sectional) and three were included in the meta-analysis. Regular-dose NSAID use did not significantly affect the risk of accelerated CKD progression; pooled odds ratio (OR) = 0.96 (95%CI: 0.86–1.07), but high-dose NSAID use significantly increased the risk of accelerated CKD progression; pooled OR = 1.26 (95%CI: 1.06–1.50).

Conclusions

The avoidance of NSAIDs in the medium term is unnecessary in patients with moderate to severe CKD, if not otherwise contraindicated. As the definition of high-dose of NSAID use remains unclear, the lowest effective dose of NSAIDs should be prescribed where indicated.

### Improving NSAIDs prescription in emergency services unit by a point-of-care-based renal function evaluation [^112jjdEo]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients evaluated in our emergency department (ED) often receive nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) without any determination of their renal function, despite the known nephrotoxicity of NSAIDs. Guidelines recommend NSAID avoidance in patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, and long-lasting therapy is not recommended in people with chronic kidney disease.

Objective

We aimed to highlight the influence of a rapid measurement of the eGFR on NSAID prescriptions in patients at risk of impaired renal function using a point-of-care (POC) device. Our goal was to prevent the potential nephrotoxicity of NSAIDs by allowing the physicians to modify their treatments after eGFR determination, while avoiding a standard blood test for patients that would extend the duration of stay in the ED.

Methods

We included 192 patients evaluated in the ED for minor trauma or injury, with an indication of treatment with NSAIDs and no known contraindication to NSAIDs. Emergency physicians were asked to register their intention to actually prescribe NSAIDs based on their clinical gestalt with specific regard to kidney function. Immediately after, the creatinine level was measured in capillary blood and eGFR was calculated using the POC device (StatSensor Creatinine; Nova Biomedical, Waltham, MA). Our physicians avoided NSAID prescriptions when eGFR was < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, and prescribed a shorter NSAID regimen therapy in patient with eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2, with a reminder to assure hydration. The decision based on eGFR was compared with original clinician intention.

Results

The clinicians intended to treat 164 patients with NSAIDs (group 1) and defer NSAIDs in 28 patients (group 2). In the first group, eGFR results supported no change in intended NSAID use in 144 patients, highlighted the need for a short regimen in 17 patients, and indicated contraindication to NSAIDs in 3 patients. In group 2, eGFR determination allowed prescription of NSAIDs in 21 patients, allowed utilization of NSAIDs with a short course in 5 patients, and supported the clinician decision to avoid NSAIDs in 2 patients.

Conclusions

POC measurement of creatinine with eGFR estimation changed the prescription of NSAIDs in almost 25% of patients with previously unknown renal function.

### An evidence-based approach to prescribing nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. third Canadian consensus conference [^111Segs8]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To revisit our previous evidence-based recommendations on the appropriate prescription of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) with particular emphasis on cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors (coxibs).

Methods

Needs assessments were conducted among Canadian physicians to determine their educational needs surrounding NSAID/coxibs. A survey of patients with arthritis was also conducted. Consensus participants reviewed articles relating to NSAID/coxibs in peer-reviewed journals between January 2000 and December 2004. At the consensus meeting, held January 21–23, 2005, participants discussed selected topics, after which recommendations were formulated and debated. Results. At the time of the meeting, it was agreed that emerging cardiovascular data were not clear enough to decide whether unanticipated cardiovascular events associated with coxibs represent a class effect or an effect of an individual drug. However, publications that appeared shortly after the meeting, as well as data presented at both the Joint Meeting of the Arthritis Advisory Committee and the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee of the US Food and Drug Administration, February 16–18, 2005, and Health Canada's Expert Advisory Panel on the Safety of Cox-2 Selective NSAID, June 9–10, 2005, clarified that all available coxibs do carry some degree of cardiovascular risk, denoting a class effect. Our consensus group made the following specific recommendations: (1) Patients should be fully informed about treatment options, including the need to balance between cardiovascular risks and gastrointestinal (GI) benefits of NSAID/coxibs. (2) Coxibs are as effective as nonselective NSAID and superior to acetaminophen for the symptoms of arthritis. Topical NSAID may also be beneficial. (3) Coxibs are associated with fewer severe GI complications than nonselective NSAID. A proton pump inhibitor (PPI) should be prescribed if an NSAID must be used in a patient at increased GI risk. (4) The renal/blood pressure (BP) impact of coxibs is similar to that of NSAID. (5) In individuals at risk, creatinine clearance and BP should be determined at baseline and shortly after treatment begins. (6) In the geriatric population, use of nonpharmacological therapies should be maximized, and special caution is required before prescribing oral NSAID/coxibs. (7) Patients taking rofecoxib have been shown to have an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Current data suggest that this increased cardiovascular risk may be an effect of the NSAID/coxib class. (8) Although the data are limited, coxibs may be more cost-effective for patients at high GI risk than nonselective NSAID plus proprietary PPI.

Conclusion

Coxibs continue to be an option in the treatment armamentarium. Given the evolving cardiovascular information, physicians and patients should weigh the benefits and risks of NSAID/coxib treatment. This concern emphasizes the need to routinely reassess patients' risks. These recommendations, which were formulated according to the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation, are intended to be used as guidelines to supplement, but not replace, the physician's judgment in clinical decision-making.

### Practice advisory on the appropriate use of NSAIDs in primary care [^114CqqYy]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Inflammation is common in many chronic pain conditions where the burden of disease is high. NSAIDs are an effective therapy for such conditions, but appropriate risk evaluation is important when selecting an NSAID in order to balance efficacy and risk. This practice advisory serves to update previously published guidelines, and in particular offers PCPs a simplified approach to choosing an appropriate NSAID for pain management based on recent evidence and according to the risk profile of individual patients. In this regard, all NSAIDs have a safety profile that requires consideration of GI, CV and renal risk. Whereas GI and CV risk were previously acknowledged according to COX-1 and COX-2 selectivity, respectively, it is apparent that this is too simplistic and appropriate risk management requires consideration of the individual (ie, non-class) effects of each NSAID. Having chosen an appropriate NSAID, there is an ongoing need for patient monitoring and risk assessment.

### Patterns of NSAIDs use and their association with other analgesic use in CKD [^1169V2NX]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Avoiding nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is important for safe CKD care. This study examined nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use patterns and their association with other analgesic use in CKD.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

The Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study is an observational cohort study that enrolled 3939 adults ages 21–74 years old with CKD between 2003 and 2008 using age-based eGFR inclusion criteria. Annual visits between June of 2003 and December of 2011 were organized into 15,917 visit-pairs (with an antecedent and subsequent visit) for 3872 participants with medication information. Demographics, kidney function, and clinical factors were ascertained along with report of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug or other analgesic use in the prior 30 days.

Results

In our study, 24% of participants reported nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use at baseline or at least one follow-up study visit. Having a 10 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 higher eGFR level at an antecedent visit was associated with higher odds of starting nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs at a subsequent visit (odds ratio, 1.44; 95% confidence interval, 1.34 to 1.56). Seeing a nephrologist at the antecedent visit was associated with lower odds of starting or staying on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs at a subsequent visit (odds ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.56 to 0.87 and odds ratio, 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.46 to 0.81, respectively). Starting and stopping nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were both associated with higher odds of increasing the number of other analgesics (odds ratio, 1.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.25 to 1.85 and odds ratio, 1.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.39 to 2.28, respectively) and higher odds of increasing the number of opioid analgesics specifically (odds ratio, 1.92; 95% confidence interval, 1.48 to 2.48 and odds ratio, 1.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.04 to 2.03, respectively).

Conclusions

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use is common among patients with CKD but less so among those with worse kidney function or those who see a nephrologist. Initiation or discontinuation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is often associated with supplementation with or replacement by, respectively, other analgesics, including opioids, which introduces possible drug-related problems when taking these alternative analgesics.

### Estimated GFR reporting is associated with decreased nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug prescribing and increased renal function [^115kwvQr]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

A sensitivity analysis was performed by using the closest eGFR after the last NSAID was prescribed. In this case, more patients were included in the study (n = 15,212). There were 10,669 patients in stage 3, 3163 patients in stage 4, and 1380 patients in stage 5. The absolute changes in eGFR were −0.3, 4.2, and 7.4 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 for stages 3, 4, and 5, respectively.

Implementation of eGFR reporting was associated with reduced NSAID prescribing in patients who had creatinine and eGFR measurements (n = 62,716) during the study period (adjusted odds ratio, 0.78 95% confidence interval 0.75–0.82).

### Assessment of prescription analgesic use in older adults with and without chronic kidney disease and outcomes [^114NQ9u6]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is prescription analgesic use higher among Medicare patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) compared with the general population?

Findings

In this cohort study of more than 6 million Medicare Part D beneficiaries, use of both opioids and prescription nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) increased substantially among patients with CKD aged 65 years or older from 2006 to 2015. Patients with CKD used significantly more opioids but less NSAIDs compared with the non-CKD population.

Meaning

Results of this study suggest that optimization of pain management in CKD is warranted.

### Diagnosis and management of non-dialysis chronic kidney disease in ambulatory care: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines [^115d6yhE]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Stakeholder and patient involvement

Several guidelines incompletely described the target user group. Guideline development groups were not always defined and often did not include methodologists, primary care physicians and health care workers other than physicians.

Rigor of development

Systematic evidence search and selection were incompletely described in several guidelines. Strengths and limitations of the evidence were not rigorously discussed by several guidelines. Health benefits and side effects were inconsistently considered in formulating recommendations. Only NICE described a structured strategy for formulating recommendations. External reviews were incompletely reported by most guidelines. Several guidelines incompletely described an updating procedure.

Clarity of presentation

Wording of recommendations was mostly unambiguous, but treatment alternatives where inconsistently addressed. The option abstaining form therapy was only mentioned by NICE.

Applicability

Facilitators and barriers and implementation strategies were incompletely addressed in most guidelines. No guideline described formal tools for barrier analysis. Only NICE consistently considered resource implications of recommendations and auditing and monitoring criteria. KDIGO provided no recommendations for implementation since it is intended to be a template for national adaptations.

Editorial Independence

Independence of the funding body was incompletely reported in several guidelines and two guidelines did not report conflicts of interest (Additional file 1).

Recommendations

Definition

The definition of CKD in the included guidelines was congruent with the KDIGO definition of CKD as abnormalities of kidney structure or function with albuminuria or GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m 2 for > 3 months.

CEBAM and USPSTF restricted the definition to decreased kidney function persisting for more than 3 months. None of the guidelines provided a description of relevant structural kidney abnormalities.

Prevention

General lifestyle recommendations like weight management and sodium restriction for CKD prevention were mentioned only by KHA-CARI with medium grades of recommendation and low levels of evidence (Table 4). Other guidelines' lifestyle recommendations were aimed solely at persons with established CKD.

### Etodolac [^115Ehcv1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of etodolac and other treatment options before deciding to use etodolac. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS).

After observing the response to the initial therapy with etodolac, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs.

Dosage adjustment of etodolac is generally not required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Etodolac should be used with caution in such patients, because, as with other NSAIDs, it may further decrease renal function in some patients with impaired renal function (see WARNINGS, Renal Effects).

Analgesia

The recommended total daily dose of etodolac for acute pain is up to 1,000 mg, given as 200 to 400 mg every 6 to 8 hours. Doses of etodolac greater than 1,000 mg/day have not been adequately evaluated in well-controlled clinical trials.

Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis

The recommended starting dose of etodolac for the management of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis is: 300 mg b.i.d., t.i.d., or 400 mg b.i.d., or 500 mg b.i.d. A lower dose of 600 mg/day may suffice for long-term administration. Physicians should be aware that doses above 1,000 mg/day have not been adequately evaluated in well-controlled clinical trials.

In chronic conditions, a therapeutic response to therapy with etodolac is sometimes seen within one week of therapy, but most often is observed by two weeks. After a satisfactory response has been achieved, the patient's dose should be reviewed and adjusted as required.

### Joint AAD-NPF guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with awareness and attention to comorbidities [^114Mfnxb]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Joint AAD–NPF psoriasis guidelines — renal disease comorbidity and medication considerations report that in a large Chinese cohort severe psoriasis was an independent risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease, with 4633 psoriatic patients and 922,534 controls and adjusted risks CKD aHR 1.90 (95% CI 1.33–2.70) and end-stage renal disease aHR 2.97 (95% CI 1.72–5.11), while no association was noted for mild psoriasis. In a prospective study of 4344 psoriasis patients and 13,003 controls followed up to 5 years, psoriasis was associated with increased CKD risk (aHR 1.28, 95% CI 1.14–1.44) and with glomerulonephritis (HR 1.50, 95% CI 1.24–1.81); CKD risk was higher with psoriatic arthritis (HR 1.62 vs 1.26), and NSAID use had the strongest association with CKD (aOR 1.69, 95% CI 1.14–2.49). Registry data including 39,074 psoriasis patients and 154,775 matched controls showed strongest associations for death were kidney disease (HR 2.20, P < .01) and liver disease (HR 4.26, P < .001); another database study comparing 205,815 psoriasis patients with 1,019,140 unaffected patients found increased risks for IgA nephropathy (aHR 4.75) and glomerular disease (aHR 2.05) in moderate-to-severe psoriasis. NSAIDs should be used cautiously; cyclosporine is associated with nephrotoxicity and the presence of pre-existing kidney disease is a contraindication to cyclosporine use, with the best predictor of cyclosporine-induced nephropathy being the percentage increase in serum creatinine above baseline and early morning blood pressure reading more accurate than serum creatinine; methotrexate is eliminated by renal excretion; and for apremilast, renal impairment reduces clearance and the Food and Drug Administration recommends a maintenance dose reduction for severe renal disease.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline summary management of osteoarthritis of the hip [^117Ljd9e]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2024). High credibility.

Pharmacological management: NSAIDs — "When not contraindicated, oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) should be used to reduce pain and improve function in the treatment of symptomatic hip osteoarthritis", with "Quality of Evidence: High" and "Strength of Recommendation: Strong". The guideline rationale states "Five studies (three moderate quality and two high quality) compared oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) with placebo for treatment of symptomatic osteoarthritis of the hip and showed improvement in pain and function scores", that "Compared to placebo, all five studies reported on pain and uniformly reported improvement in pain with the use of oral NSAIDs", and that "The Western Ontario McMaster Arthritis Index (WOMAC) score was reported in all studies, all of which reported improvement in WOMAC function with NSAIDs compared to placebo". Head-to-head articles reported "lumiracoxib showed similar efficacy to celecoxib", "celecoxib 200mg/day and 400mg/day showed similar efficacy to naproxen", and "similar efficacy between valdecoxib 10mg and naproxen". Under benefits/harm, "Contraindications that should be considered include, but are not limited to, patients with chronic kidney disease or patients with significant cardiac conditions that may be at an elevated risk of myocardial infarction". Outcome importance notes "The use of non-opioid medications such as NSAIDs for nonoperative treatment of symptomatic osteoarthritis of the hip is extremely important to minimize the use of opioids". Cost/resource statements note NSAIDs are "widely available and an extremely cost-effective treatment" but "there is limited comparative data on the cost-effectiveness of oral NSAIDs compared to other nonoperative treatments of osteoarthritis of the hip". For implementation, "This recommendation should be readily implemented as it does not influence a major change in clinical practice" and "Oral NSAIDs are widely available. Thus, this recommendation should be easily implemented with no apparent barriers to adoption".

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^11366CiG]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

NSAID safety in chronic kidney disease (CKD) emphasizes that concomitant use of multiple agents that affect kidney hemodynamics (e.g. RAASi, diuretics, SGLT2i, finerenone) as well as volume depletion may further increase the risk of NSAID-induced AKI; consider increasing frequency of eGFR monitoring with NSAID use, especially if prolonged or high-dose. Risks of NSAIDs are likely to outweigh benefits where there is evidence of little to no benefit (e.g., chronic primary musculoskeletal or wide-spread pain syndromes); determine meaningful functional targets for the patient, using SDM, prior to a trial of NSAID therapy, and proactively educate the patients on risks of NSAIDs, both OTC and prescribed, noting that patients may use OTC NSAIDs without discussion with a provider.

### Comparative risks of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on CKD [^112eLuEQ]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

There have been doubts about the association between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and worsening kidney function, and whether there is a difference between risks of individual nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is presently unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the association between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug exposure and the risk of incident eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 and compare the risks between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug subtypes in the Chinese population.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

From 2008 to 2017, a total of 1,982,488 subjects aged 18 years or older with baseline eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression adjusted for each patient's baseline characteristics was adopted to examine the association between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and incident eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 or eGFR decline ≥ 30% with reference to baseline.

Results

After a median follow-up duration of 6.3 (interquartile range, 3.3–9.4) years, 271,848 cases (14%) of incident eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 and 388,386 (21%) events of eGFR decline ≥ 30% were recorded. After adjusting for each patient's baseline characteristics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug treatment was shown to be associated with a significantly higher risk of incident eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (hazard ratio, 1.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.67 to 1.75) and eGFR decline ≥ 30% (hazard ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.89 to 1.96) when compared with no nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, with etoricoxib exhibiting the highest risk of eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (hazard ratio, 3.12; 95% confidence interval, 2.69 to 3.62) and eGFR decline ≥ 30% (hazard ratio, 3.11; 95% confidence interval, 2.78 to 3.48) and ibuprofen displaying the lowest risk of eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (hazard ratio, 1.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.23) and eGFR decline ≥ 30% (hazard ratio, 1.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.23 to 1.41).

Conclusions

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug exposure was associated with higher risks of incident eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 and eGFR decline ≥ 30%. Highest risk was observed in etoricoxib users, and lowest risk was with ibuprofen.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug induced acute kidney injury in the community dwelling general population and people with chronic kidney disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115NcDw5]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Study selection

The search strategy and data extraction were defined in a PICOS format (participants, intervention, comparison, outcome and study design). Studies published in English were eligible for inclusion when they used observational methods to study adults in the community exposed to NSAIDs and reported AKI as an outcome. Given the historical lack of consensus on AKI definition, studies using a variety of definitions of AKI were included, with AKI defined by International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 9 or 10 codes, or change in eGFR or creatinine clearance (CrCl) or serum creatinine (SCr). Similarly, varying definitions of CKD were allowed including estimated GFR < 60 ml/min (with or without standardization to body surface area), or based on ICD codes, or SCr > 122 μmol/L, or structured patient interview. Traditional NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors were included with the exception of low dose aspirin (< 300 mg per dose). Studies were excluded if they were published in abstract only, included children (age < 18 years old), only included post-operative patients or others receiving only one or two doses of NSAID as treatment (e.g. for renal colic or post-lithotripsy), or had end-stage renal disease defined as being on dialysis or having received a renal transplant. Finally, meta-analyses, studies with < 100 subjects, and studies without a contemporaneous control group drawn from the same population were excluded.

### Celecoxib (generic drug) [^116ayrHH]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Elderly patients, compared to younger patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions. If the anticipated benefit for the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks, start dosing at the low end of the dosing range, and monitor patients for adverse effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.6, 5.13)].

Of the total number of patients who received celecoxib in pre-approval clinical trials, more than 3,300 were 65–74 years of age, while approximately 1,300 additional patients were 75 years and over. No substantial differences in effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. In clinical studies comparing renal function as measured by the GFR, BUN and creatinine, and platelet function as measured by bleeding time and platelet aggregation, the results were not different between elderly and young volunteers.

However, as with other NSAIDs, including those that selectively inhibit COX-2, there have been more spontaneous post-marketing reports of fatal GI events and acute renal failure in the elderly than in younger patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.6)].

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

The daily recommended dose of celecoxib capsules in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) should be reduced by 50%. The use of celecoxib in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 Renal Impairment

Celecoxib is not recommended in patients with severe renal insufficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.8 Poor Metabolizers of CYP2C9 Substrates

In patients who are known or suspected to be poor CYP2C9 metabolizers (i.e. CYP2C9✱3/✱3), based on genotype or previous history/experience with other CYP2C9 substrates (such as warfarin, phenytoin) administer celecoxib starting with half the lowest recommended dose. Alternative management should be considered in JRA patients identified to be CYP2C9 poor metabolizers [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].

### Ketoprofen [^111NCVxD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of ketoprofen capsules and other treatment options before deciding to use ketoprofen capsules. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS).

After observing the response to initial therapy with ketoprofen capsules, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs.

Concomitant use of ketoprofen capsules and ketoprofen extended-release capsules is not recommended.

If minor side effects appear, they may disappear at a lower dose which may still have an adequate therapeutic effect. If well tolerated but not optimally effective, the dosage may be increased. Individual patients may show a better response to 300 mg of ketoprofen capsules daily as compared to 200 mg, although in well-controlled clinical trials patients on 300 mg did not show greater mean effectiveness. They did, however, show an increased frequency of upper- and lower-GI distress and headaches. It is of interest that women also had an increased frequency of these adverse effects compared to men. When treating patients with 300 mg/day, the physician should observe sufficient increased clinical benefit to offset potential increased risk.

In patients with mildly impaired renal function, the maximum recommended total daily dose of ketoprofen capsules is 150 mg. In patients with a more severe renal impairment (GFR less than 25 mL/min/1.73 m2 or end-stage renal impairment), the maximum total daily dose of ketoprofen capsules should not exceed 100 mg.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the non-surgical management of hip&knee osteoarthritis [^111GTg8P]. DoD/VA (2020). High credibility.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and risk of renal disease: Use of non‑selective or COX‑2 selective NSAIDs can result in renal papillary necrosis, acute tubular necrosis, acute interstitial nephritis with or without nephrotic syndrome, renal insufficiency, fluid and electrolyte disturbances, acute renal failure, or other renal‑related injuries in an estimated 1–5% of patients, and all available agents approved for use in the U.S. include a warning for such events in their prescribing information. The risk for renal adverse events increases in patients who are dependent upon a compensatory increase in renal prostaglandins to maintain renal perfusion, and patients at higher risk include those with preexisting renal disease, volume depletion (e.g., diuretics, vomiting), congestive heart failure, liver dysfunction, cirrhosis with ascites, use of angiotensin‑converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and older patients. In healthy patients, renal prostaglandins do not play a significant role in maintaining renal perfusion; however, in reduced volume, hypotension, and reduced renal perfusion, NSAID administration reduces compensatory vasodilatory renal prostaglandins, which can result in reduced renal perfusion and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and can lead to renal damage. Although other mechanisms exist, hemodynamically mediated acute renal insufficiency is the most common cause and is most frequently reversible once the offending agent is discontinued. In the PRECISION study, renal events were prospectively monitored in more than 20,000 RA or OA patients receiving celecoxib, ibuprofen, or naproxen for a mean follow‑up of 20 months, and eligible patients had baseline serum creatinine values within normal limits.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^115P6YDs]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) medication management — Where precision is required for dosing or estimates may be unreliable, we recommend methods based upon cystatin C or direct measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (1C). We recommend temporary discontinuation of potentially nephrotoxic and renally excreted drugs in people with a GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m² (GFR categories G3a-G5) who have serious intercurrent illness that increases the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI), including renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers (including ACE-Is, ARBs, aldosterone inhibitors, direct renin inhibitors), diuretics, NSAIDs, metformin, lithium, and digoxin (1C). We recommend that adults with CKD seek medical or pharmacist advice before using over-the-counter medicines or nutritional protein supplements (1B), and we recommend not using herbal remedies in people with CKD (1D). For metformin, we recommend that it be continued in people with GFR ≥ 45 ml/min/1.73 m² (GFR categories G1-G3a); its use should be reviewed in those with GFR 30–44 ml/min/1.73 m² (GFR category G3b); and it should be discontinued in people with GFR < 30 ml/min/ 1.73 m² (GFR categories G4-G5) (1C). We recommend that all people taking potentially nephrotoxic agents such as lithium, aminoglycosides, and calcineurin inhibitors should have their GFR, electrolytes and drug levels regularly monitored (1A). The US Food and Drug Administration black-box warning for metformin states it is contraindicated in patients with serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL in men and ≥ 1.4 mg/dL in women, and it is now recognized that the risk for lactic acidosis in patients on metformin is extremely low.

### Lifetime nonnarcotic analgesic use and decline in renal function in women… [^112WBLrj]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

Acetaminophen use was associated with an increased risk of a GFR decline of at least 30 mL/min per 1. 73 m2 and a GFR decline of 30% or greater, but aspirin and NSAID use were not. Compared with women consuming less than 100 g of acetaminophen, multivariate-adjusted odds ratio for a decline in GFR of at least 30 mL/min per 1. 73 m2 for women consuming more than 3000 g was 2.
04. There were 168 women for whom the estimated GFR decreased by at least 30 mL/min per 1. 73 m2 during the 11-year study, and the multivariate ORs are given in Table
3. Acetaminophen use was significantly associated with increased risk, but aspirin and NSAID use were not. There were 177 women for whom the estimated GFR decreased by at least 30% in 11 years, and the multivariate ORs are given in Table 4. Acetaminophen use was significantly associated with risk of GFR decline, but aspirin and NSAID use were not associated with risk. The unadjusted proportion of women who had consumed less than 100 g of acetaminophen and had a 30% or greater decline in estimated GFR was 8% compared with 15% of women who had consumed 3000 g or more. The odds of at least a 30% decline in GFR increased with increasing lifetime intake. Finally, because participants were selected from a general population, the results apply to most analgesic users who do not already have known established renal dysfunction. Published results of the association between NSAID use and risk of renal dysfunction have been inconsistent. These drugs have well-documented acute effects on the kidney, including decreased GFR; diminished ability to excrete sodium, potassium, and water; and interstitial nephritis with glomerular changes.

3 Although some case-control studies13, 15 found an increased risk, our findings are consistent with the recent studies4, 7 that found that NSAID use is not associated with risk of chronic renal dysfunction.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^115UFoXf]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

VA/DoD low back pain — NSAID selection and safety — Most comparative trials between NSAIDs showed no significant differences in pain relief, and an SR comparing cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) NSAIDs with traditional NSAIDs reported no statistically significant difference for pain relief for acute low back pain in four studies and no differences for chronic LBP in a fifth. A large noninferiority trial randomized 24,081 patients to celecoxib, naproxen, or ibuprofen and found the cardiovascular (CV) risk associated with celecoxib was noninferior to the non-selective NSAIDs; limitations included drug discontinuation 68.8%, study dropout 27.4%, most patients 90% had OA, and a dose of celecoxib limited to 200 mg/day with dose escalation allowed for ibuprofen and naproxen. All NSAIDs have a black box warning for increased risk of CV and gastrointestinal (GI) events; if an NSAID is required in a patient with CV risk, naproxen may be a viable option; the use of relatively selective COX-2 inhibitors reduces the risk for GI events, but this benefit is negated if the patient is using aspirin; NSAIDs can also exacerbate heart failure and worsen hypertension and renal function and must be used cautiously or avoided in patients with renal impairment or in elderly patients.

### Assessment of prescription analgesic use in older adults with and without chronic kidney disease and outcomes [^115heYoE]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

Our study suggests that there has been substantial use of opioids and prescription NSAIDs among older patients with CKD in the US with a clear increasing trend until recently, with early suggestion of decreasing use, perhaps due to the recent heightened awareness of the opioid epidemic in the US. Clinicians must continue evaluating benefits and risks of using opioids and NSAIDs in this and other patient populations. Specifically, clear clinical guidelines for chronic pain management among patients aged 65 years and older with CKD may be warranted to address potentially suboptimal pain management in this patient population.

5.6 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia

Renal Toxicity

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.

Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics, ACE inhibitors or the ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of celecoxib in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of celecoxib may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with preexisting renal disease.

Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating celecoxib. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of celecoxib [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Avoid the use of celecoxib in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If celecoxib is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.

Hyperkalemia

Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.

5.7 Anaphylactic Reactions

Celecoxib has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to celecoxib and in patients with aspirin sensitive asthma. Celecoxib is a sulfonamide and both NSAIDs and sulfonamides may cause allergic type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

Seek emergency help if any anaphylactic reaction occurs.

### Prescription of high-risk medications among patients with chronic kidney disease: a cross-sectional study from the Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho region practice and research network [^112rRwqD]. Family Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at high risk for adverse drug events related to medication dosing errors and prescriptions for relatively contraindicated medications, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Objectives

To examine the scope of and variation in prescribing relatively contraindicated medications and medications above the recommended dose levels among patients with stage III/IV CKD in primary care practice.

Methods

This is a cross-sectional descriptive study that used structured electronic health record data. The study participants were patients aged 18 years and older from three primary care clinics in a practice-based research network. Number/proportion of adult patients with stage III/IV CKD; proportion of these patients with at least one NSAID or other relatively contraindicated medication prescribed over 2 years.

Results

Of the 7586 eligible adult patients, 4.9% had stage III/IV CKD; 46.6% of these 373 patients with stage III/IV CKD were prescribed at least one relatively contraindicated drug (acarbose, chlorpropamide, glyburide, nitrofurantoin or any NSAID) during the 2-year study period; and 34.0% of patients with stage III/IV CKD were prescribed NSAIDs.

Conclusions

Primary care patients with stage III/IV CKD were frequently prescribed or had documented use of relatively contraindicated drugs and thus were at risk of adverse drug events. Given the significant number of individuals with CKD in the USA, research that examines rates of adverse events related to these prescriptions and that tests primary care-based interventions to decrease inappropriate prescribing of relatively contraindicated medications to these patients is needed.

### COX-2 inhibitors and the kidney [^117JAGGv]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective inhibitors are now extensively used for their anti-inflammatory and analgesic efficacy. Several large controlled trials provide evidence to support the proposition that they cause fewer major gastro-intestinal side effects and less toxicity than routine nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In view of the documented different localizations of the cyclooxygenase-1 and COX-2 enzymes in the kidney, it was initially hoped that COX-2 inhibitors would be associated with fewer renal side effects than other NSAIDs. This has not been borne out by subsequent studies. Like other NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors can cause salt and water retention, leading to edema and worsening hypertension. They can also cause acute declines in renal function and glomerular filtration rate. These events are, however, uncommon in large rheumatology populations and infrequently lead to discontinuation of the medications. Judicious use of COX-2 inhibitors in high-risk patients (such as those with chronic renal insufficiency, diabetes or congestive heart failure) will lead to a decreased incidence of adverse renal events.

### Literature review: are NSAIDs harmful and is acetaminophen well tolerated? [^116mPu3s]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

On the basis of previous literature, NSAID use is typically avoided in patients at risk for kidney disease, while acetaminophen has generally been considered well tolerated. However, the extent of NSAID effect on the kidneys is not clear, especially in chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the concerns about the safety of acetaminophen have been rising. In this review, we will discuss the latest evidence of the effects of NSAIDs and acetaminophen in the context of nephrology and hypertension.

Recent Findings

The risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) by NSAIDs is higher with longer courses and in the presence of several factors such as older age, diabetes mellitus, lower eGFR, diuretic use and cardiovascular disease. The timing of NSAID use in relation to the onset of AKI may affect its progression. Regular NSAID use could be associated with an increased incidence of CKD, but the relation between NSAID use and CKD progression is less clear. Regular acetaminophen use was associated with increased SBP, while its use could have a renoprotective effect in certain situations.

Summary

In patients at risk of kidney disease, NSAIDs may be used cautiously after discussing possible adverse effects. Regular acetaminophen use should be reassessed in patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug induced acute kidney injury in the community dwelling general population and people with chronic kidney disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^116up4JP]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

There is little evidence about the risk of AKI associated with NSAID use in people with CKD available from randomised trials of NSAIDs because such trials routinely exclude people with CKD and rarely report renal outcomes. Under these circumstances, observational evidence provides the best guide to practice that exists. The aim of this study is to systematically review published high-quality population-based observational studies to quantify the risk of AKI due to NSAIDs in the general population and in people with pre-existing CKD.

### Practice advisory on the appropriate use of NSAIDs in primary care [^113JXtQF]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Based on data from PRECISION, a toxicity risk score that predicts the one-year risk of major toxicity has been validated among NSAID users. Major toxicity included MACE, AKI, significant GI events and mortality. In the derivation cohort from PRECISION, significant variables that predicted increased risk of a major toxicity were age, male sex, history of CV disease, hypertension, DM, tobacco use, statin use, elevated serum creatinine, hematocrit level, and type of arthritis. Based on an individual patient's calculated risk score, the patient can be classified into one of three categories, including low risk (< 1%), moderate risk (1–4%) and high risk (≥ 4%).

An updated treatment algorithm is provided, which supports recommended NSAID prescribing practices based on GI, CV and renal risk factors (Figure 1).

### Renal effects of COX-2-selective inhibitors [^112VpcxK]. American Journal of Nephrology (2001). Low credibility.

Although nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) effectively treat a variety of inflammatory diseases, these agents may cause deleterious effects on kidney function, especially with respect to solute homeostasis and maintenance of renal perfusion and glomerular filtration. NSAIDs act by reducing prostaglandin biosynthesis through inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) which exists as two isoforms (COX-1 and COX-2). NSAID-induced gastrointestinal toxicity is generally believed to occur through blockade of COX-1 activity, whereas the anti-inflammatory effects of NSAIDs are thought to occur primarily through inhibition of the inducible isoform, COX-2. However, the situation in the kidney may be somewhat different. Recent studies have demonstrated that COX-2 is constitutively expressed in renal tissues of all species; this isoform may, therefore, be intimately involved in prostaglandin-dependent renal homeostatic processes. Drugs that selectively inhibit COX-2 might, therefore, be expected to produce effects on renal function similar to nonselective NSAIDs which inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2. This assertion is borne out by recent clinical studies showing that the COX-2 inhibitors rofecoxib and celecoxib procedure qualitative changes in urinary prostaglandin excretion, glomerular filtration rate, sodium retention, and their consequences similar to nonselective NSAIDs. It, therefore, seems unlikely that these COX-2 inhibitors (and perhaps their successors) will offer renal safety benefits over nonselective NSAID therapies, and, at this juncture, it is reasonable to assume that all NSAIDs, including COX-2-selective inhibitors, share a similar risk for adverse renal effects.

### The assessment of renal function in relation to the use of drugs in elderly in nursing homes; a cohort study [^116AnSHi]. BMC Geriatrics (2011). Low credibility.

In this study population, the investigated renal risk drugs were rather rarely prescribed, especially metformin (4 patients) and NSAID (4 patients). This may indicate awareness among the prescribers of renal impairment in the elderly population and the accompanied risk when prescribing medications. The awareness of this risk of metformin appears higher than previously reported. In an out-patient clinic in Palestine 60% of the patients treated with metformin had at least one contraindication and a Thai study showed that over 80% of patients with type 2 diabetes with contraindication for metformin were using this medication.

The exception in our study is ACE-inhibitors/ARB, which were prescribed to 40 patients. These medications however, are also renoprotective and should thus be considered for this group of patients. Many of the subjects using ACE-inhibitors/ARB had reduced GFR (65% when cystatin C-estimated). This may represent an intentional use for these patients as renoprotection. However, one has to be observant and the potassium levels should be strictly monitored. The use of diuretics was frequent, 100 patients, and this may of course also affect potassium levels.

Almost half of the subjects taking digoxin had reduced GFR (< 60 ml/min). This may be risky, due to the narrow therapeutic index of digoxin. There is an obvious risk that GFR is gradually decreasing even more, with the subsequent accumulation and adverse reactions. Sweileh et al found that digoxin was one of the most commonly prescribed inappropriate medications in patients with renal insufficiency. Accordingly, digoxin is one of the medications frequently seen in patients admitted to hospital due to adverse reactions. Probably the prescribers of the patients in our study had only observed s-creatinine before initiating the digoxin therapy, since almost half of the subjects with renal impairment had normal levels of s-creatinine. It is however not surprising that 19 patients were prescribed digoxin, since as many as 40 patients had chronic atrial fibrillation.

### The case for cautious consumption: NSAIDs in chronic kidney disease [^113gVCqZ]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Strong epidemiological and pathologic evidence associates NSAIDs with kidney disease, both acute and chronic. Hence, the usage of NSAIDs has decreased in patients with, or at risk for, chronic kidney disease (CKD). Coupled with this has been a rise in use of opioids and other non-NSAID alternatives, which do come with significant, and underrecognized, risk of nonrenal adverse events. We review the literature to understand if this shift is appropriate or deleterious.

Recent Findings

NSAIDs do have a low but tangible risk in causing acute kidney injury, electrolyte imbalances, and increasing blood pressure. However, their role in causing progressive kidney disease is due to long-term usage in high cumulative dosages, and the use of NSAIDs in combination with other agents. Alternatives such as opioids, tramadol, gabapentin and baclofen have weak evidence to support their use and strong evidence to show their harm in patients with CKD.

Summary

Tradeoffs are inherent in using active pharmaceuticals, and NSAIDs are no exception. Balancing potential benefits with possible adverse effects around pain management should be a part of every conversation for patients with kidney disease.

### Preventing contrast medium-induced acute kidney injury: side-by-side comparison of Swedish-ESUR guidelines [^113UqJB6]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

A side-by-side comparison of updated guidelines regarding contrast medium-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) from the Swedish Society of Uroradiology (SSUR) and the European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) is presented. The major discrepancies include a higher glomerular filtration rate (GFR) threshold as a risk factor for CI-AKI and for discontinuation of metformin by SSUR, i.e., < 45 ml/min versus < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 by ESUR, when intravenous or intra-arterial contrast media (CM) with second-pass renal exposure is administered. SSUR also continues to recommend consideration of traditional non-renal risk factors such as diabetes and congestive heart failure, while ESUR considers these factors as non-specific for CI-AKI and does not recommend any consideration. Contrary to ESUR, SSUR also recommends discontinuation of NSAID and nephrotoxic medication if possible. Insufficient evidence at the present time motivates the more cautionary attitude taken by SSUR. Furthermore, SSUR expresses GFR thresholds in absolute values in ml/min as recommended by the National Kidney Foundation for drugs excreted by glomerular filtration, while ESUR uses the relative GFR normalised to body surface area in ml/min/1.73 m 2. CM dose/GFR ratio thresholds established for coronary angiography/interventions are also applied as recommendations for CM-enhanced CT by SSUR, since SSUR regards coronary procedures as a second-pass renal exposure of CM with no obvious difference in the incidence of AKI compared with IV CM administration. Finally, SSUR recommends reducing the gram-iodine dose/GFR ratio from < 1.0 in patients not at risk to < 0.5 in patients at risk of CI-AKI, while ESUR has no such recommendation. KEY POINTS:
- The more cautionary attitude taken by SSUR compared with that of ESUR is motivated by insufficient evidence regarding risk for contrast medium-induced acute kidney injuries (CI-AKI).
- SSUR recommends that absolute and not relative GFR should be used when dosing drugs eliminated by the kidneys such as contrast media.
- According to SSUR the gram-iodine dose/GFR ratio should be < 0.5 in patients at risk of CI-AKI, while ESUR has no such recommendation.

5.6 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia

Renal Toxicity

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.

Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of TIVORBEX in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of TIVORBEX may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with preexisting renal disease.

Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating TIVORBEX. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of TIVORBEX [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Avoid the use of TIVORBEX in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If TIVORBEX is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.

It has been reported that the addition of the potassium-sparing diuretic, triamterene, to a maintenance schedule of indomethacin resulted in reversible acute renal failure in two of four healthy volunteers. Indomethacin and triamterene should not be administered together.

Hyperkalemia

Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.

Both indomethacin and potassium-sparing diuretics may be associated with increased serum potassium levels. The potential effects of indomethacin and potassium-sparing diuretics on potassium levels and renal function should be considered when these agents are administered concurrently.

5.7 Anaphylact ic Reactions

Indomethacin has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to indomethacin and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs.

### Need for a judicious use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to avoid community-acquired acute kidney injury [^112FzdNJ]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Millions of Americans use over-the-counter analgesics on a daily basis, and nearly 100 million nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) prescriptions are filled per year. In high-risk patients, these medications can disrupt kidney hemodynamics and precipitate community-acquired acute kidney injury (CA-AKI). The risk of NSAID-associated CA-AKI increases 3- to 5-fold in patients taking renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and diuretics concurrently. CA-AKI increases the risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD) or accelerating progression of pre-existing CKD. Importantly, many cases of NSAID-induced CA-AKI may be avoided by identifying high-risk patients and providing patient and provider education on when to avoid these medications and minimize risk.

Examining the changes in renal function in patients who used NSAIDs

A total of 1522 patients had two reported eGFRs with a time interval of > 180 days and had NSAID prescriptions recorded before eGFR reporting but stopped after the first reported eGFR measurement. They were all in stages 3, 4, and 5 (1340, 162, and 20 patients in stages 3, 4, and 5, respectively). Table 1 shows the characteristics of patients by CKD stage. Patients in stage 5 were significantly younger than patients in stages 3 and 4. There were no differences in gender, socioeconomic status, type of NSAIDs used, and diabetes history between the patients in the different CKD stages. Medical notes were reviewed for patients in the stage 5 group. Of the 20 patients studied, 11 were on dialysis and their results were excluded from the analysis in Figure 3a. The average eGFR in each stage (Figure 3a) was improved significantly in all three groups, with the largest improvement in stage 5 patients. eGFR increased from 45.9 to 46.9 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (n = 1340, P < 0.01), 23.9 to 27.1 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (n = 162, P < 0.01), and 12.4 to 26.4 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (n = 9, P < 0.01), respectively. The absolute differences were 1.0, 3.2, and 13.9 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 for stages 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Figure 3b shows the results in patients with a 3-month follow-up time (1700, 181, and 24 patients for stages 3, 4, and 5, respectively). The absolute difference of eGFR was similar in stage 3 patients, and bigger in patients with stages 4 and 5 (3.7 vs. 3.2 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, and 16.8 vs. 14.3 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, respectively).

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the non-surgical management of hip&knee osteoarthritis [^116sjyWs]. DoD/VA (2020). High credibility.

VA/DoD hip and knee osteoarthritis — renal safety with NSAIDs and CKD precautions: There were no differences in renal events between celecoxib and naproxen, but a lower rate of renal events occurred in the celecoxib group versus the ibuprofen group (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.44–0.85). The use of NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors should generally be avoided in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially in patients with an eGFR of ≤ 30 ml/min. However, in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) whose pain is not controlled with other non-NSAID treatments, potential risks and benefits of NSAIDs should be considered on a case-by-case basis.

### Mitigating the cardiovascular and renal effects of NSAIDs [^114rB8fW]. Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are principal pharmacologic agents for symptom relief in patients with arthritis and other inflammatory conditions. Cardiovascular risk is associated with all NSAIDs, excluding aspirin. Selective inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX)-2 could produce a relative reduction in endothelial production of prostacyclin, while leaving the platelet production of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) intact. It has been speculated that this imbalance of homeostatic prostanoids might increase the risk for thrombotic events. The goal of this review is to provide physicians guidelines to mitigate cardiovascular and nephrotoxicity of NSAIDs.

Methods

We conducted a systematic literature review to determine what information is available to guide treatment decisions in this patient population.

Results

Selective inhibition of COX-2 could produce a relative reduction in endothelial production of prostacyclin, while leaving the platelet production of TXA2 intact. Increasing degrees of selectivity for COX-2 are associated with augmented cardiovascular risk, whereas increasing degrees of selectivity for cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-1) are associated with augmented gastrointestinal risk. Some NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen) can interfere with the cardioprotective effects of aspirin by competitively binding to COX-1 enzyme, resulting in increased TXA2 production Naproxen may differ from other NSAIDs in sustaining functionally important degrees of inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase-1 activity throughout the dosing interval.

Conclusion

It is of paramount importance to consider individual health factors when choosing therapy with NSAIDs.

### Summary of revisions for the 2009 clinical practice recommendations [^111DXbTp]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Prevention and Management of Diabetes Complications:

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) cut points for use of thiazide or loop diuretics have been revised.
Pharmacologic therapy for patients with diabetes and hypertension should be with a regimen that includes either an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. If one class is not tolerated, the other should be substituted. If needed to achieve blood pressure targets, a thiazide diuretic should be added to those with an estimated GFR (see below) ≥ 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 and a loop diuretic for those with an estimated GFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2. (C)
Several dyslipidemia recommendations have been revised. If drug-treated patients do not reach the above targets on maximal tolerated statin therapy, a reduction in LDL cholesterol of ∼30–40% from baseline is an alternative therapeutic goal. (A) If targets are not reached on maximally tolerated doses of statins, combination therapy using statins and other lipid-lowering agents may be considered to achieve lipid targets but have not been evaluated in outcome studies for either CVD outcomes or safety. (E)
Several antiplatelet agent recommendations have been revised and/or the level of evidence has been changed. Use aspirin therapy (75–162 mg/day) as a primary prevention strategy in those with type 1 or type 2 diabetes at increased cardiovascular risk, including those who are > 40 years of age or who have additional risk factors (family history of CVD, hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia, or albuminuria). (C) For patients with CVD and documented ASA (acetylsalicylic acid, aspirin) allergy, clopidogrel (75 mg/day) should be used. (B) Combination therapy with aspirin (75–162 mg/day) and clopidogrel (75 mg/day) is reasonable for up to a year after an acute coronary syndrome. (B)
Coronary heart disease treatment recommendations have been revised and/or the level of evidence has been changed. In patients with known CVD, ACE inhibitor (C), aspirin (A), and statin therapy (A) (if not contraindicated) should be used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. In patients > 40 years of age with another cardiovascular risk factor (hypertension, family history, dyslipidemia, microalbuminuria, cardiac autonomic neuropathy, or smoking), aspirin and statin therapy (if not contraindicated) should be used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. (B) In patients with coronary heart failure (CHF), thiazolidinedione use is contraindicated. (C) Metformin may be used in patients with stable CHF if renal function is normal. It should be avoided in unstable or hospitalized patients with CHF. (C)
The recommendation in the "Retinopathy screening and treatment" section has been revised. Adults and children aged 10 years or older with type 1 diabetes should have an initial dilated and comprehensive eye examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist within 5 years after the onset of diabetes. (B)
One recommendation in the "Neuropathy screening and treatment" section has been moved to the "Foot care" section, and one has been revised. Screening for signs and symptoms of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy should be instituted at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and 5 years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Special testing is rarely needed and may not affect management or outcomes. (E)
The "Foot care" section has been extensively revised, including the recommendations. For all patients with diabetes, perform an annual comprehensive foot examination to identify risk factors predictive of ulcers and amputations. The foot examination should include inspection, assessment of foot pulses, and testing for loss of protective sensation (10-g monofilament plus testing any one of: vibration using 128-Hz tuning fork, pinprick sensation, ankle reflexes, or vibration perception threshold).

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^1138PpkB]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Opioids versus NSAIDs in chronic kidney disease (CKD) not requiring dialysis — associations with outcomes and utilization: In a prospective cohort followed for a median of 6.8 years, baseline full-agonist opioid and NSAID use were 9.9% and 15.5% respectively; baseline opioid use was associated with increased risk for a kidney disease composite outcome, kidney failure requiring KRT, hospitalization, and death, whereas baseline NSAID use was associated with increased risk for the kidney disease composite outcome and hospitalization, with outcomes not consistent among subgroups, and overall opioid use had a stronger association with adverse effects than NSAIDs. Given benefits and risks, some reviews now recommend considering cautious time-limited use of NSAIDs with consideration of individual risk factors, SDM, and careful monitoring.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug induced acute kidney injury in the community dwelling general population and people with chronic kidney disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111x2dPV]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Data sources and search strategy

MEDLINE and EMBASE were systematically searched from inception to June 21th 2016 using OVID from the Knowledge Network using a predetermined list of keywords including NSAIDs, renal diseases and renal function measurements modified from the search strategies used by two related Cochrane reviews (see Additional file 1 for search strategy). Search results were restricted to cross-sectional, cohort and case-control studies in the English language. The reference lists from all identified primary studies, review articles, Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines for CKD and AKI and OpenSIGLE (unpublished literature database) were manually checked to screen for additional relevant papers.

Citations were independently screened for eligibility by two reviewers based on title and abstract (XZ and SB or XZ and BG). If one or more authors deemed the study potentially relevant, or if there was any uncertainty about eligibility based on title and abstract alone, then the full text paper was retrieved for review. Authors of original studies were not contacted. Study selection and quality assessment from full-text papers retrieved were performed independently by two reviewers (XZ and BG).

### Estimated GFR reporting is associated with decreased nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug prescribing and increased renal function [^116qBb2p]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

RESULTS

NSAID prescribing rates during the two time intervals

Prescriptions of NSAIDs decreased after the implementation of eGFR reporting (39,459 in the second quarter of 2005 vs. 35,415 in the first quarter of 2007, P < 0.01; Figure 1). NSAID prescribing rates in patients with CKD stages 3, 4, and 5 were 24.5% (7746/31,600), 18.3% (257/1406), and 7.7% (20/259) in the year before April 2006 and 18.3% (5052/27,474), 12.1% (196/1625), and 7.4% (26/352) in the year after eGFR reporting commenced (Figure 2). The corresponding figures for NSAID prescribing 6 months on either side of 1 April 2006 were 18.8, 15.4, and 7.0% (before eGFR reporting) and 15.5, 10.7, and 6.3% (after eGFR reporting), respectively.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug induced acute kidney injury in the community dwelling general population and people with chronic kidney disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111o6Ck2]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

The study strengths include careful study selection and the use of a structured quality assessment tool to ensure that only high quality studies were included. The observed associations were consistent across subgroups, but the study has several limitations. As with all systematic reviews, the findings depend on the quality of the included studies. We chose to review and meta-analyse observational studies because an initial literature search identified that trials of NSAIDs rarely report renal outcomes (the focus of this study) and exclude people with CKD (a key topic of interest) and other comorbidities as well as older people and minority groups. However, observational studies are vulnerable to residual confounding by measured and unmeasured variables. An example is confounding by indication, which in this context is likely to occur if prescribers avoid NSAIDs in people they perceive to be at higher risk of NSAID toxicity including AKI, which would lead to an underestimation of AKI risk if present. There were also large differences between studies in the population examined and the way in which AKI was measured, both of which likely contributed to the observed moderate to large heterogeneity between studies. It is also important to recognise that the estimate of the risk of NSAIDs in the general population is adjusted for potential confounders, but the estimate in people with CKD is not because only one study reported an adjusted estimate. Other limitations include that we only included studies published in English, that there were a relatively small number of studies suitable for inclusion which made meta-regression to explore heterogeneity unfeasible, and that the rate of concomitant use of OTC NSAID use could not be assessed in the populations studied. Seven of the included studies addressed that OCT NSAID use may have caused exposure misclassification. But all of the studies believed that due to reasons such as financial incentives, the proportion of OCT NSAID users is expected to be small and nondifferential with respect to the NSAID categories the populations studied. Consequently, it would bias the results toward the null. As most of the studies confirmed eligible cases then selected controls according to a certain proportion, non-response rate was not given in the majority of the included studies. Since cases and controls of these studies were derived from the same databases, were examined for the same exposure and followed up in the same way, then non-response rate is not considered to be a problem and therefore it is unlikely there would be missing data bias. We were unable to access publication bias because of the extensive statistical heterogeneity. For many of the methodological qualities assessed there was an unclear risk of bias as studies did not provide explicit detail to make an informed judgement.

### Celecoxib (celecoxib 100 mg) [^111dKjnj]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the total number of patients who received celecoxib in pre-approval clinical trials, more than 3,300 were 65 to 74 years of age, while approximately 1,300 additional patients were 75 years and over. No substantial differences in effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. In clinical studies comparing renal function as measured by the GFR, BUN and creatinine, and platelet function as measured by bleeding time and platelet aggregation, the results were not different between elderly and young volunteers. However, as

with other NSAIDs, including those that selectively inhibit COX-2, there have been more spontaneous post-marketing reports of fatal GI events and acute renal failure in the elderly than in younger patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.6)].

8.6 Hepatic Insufficiency

The daily recommended dose of celecoxib capsules in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) should be reduced by 50%. The use of celecoxib in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 Renal Insufficiency

Celecoxib is not recommended in patients with severe renal insufficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.8 Poor Metabolizers of CYP2C9 Substrates

Patients who are known or suspected to be poor CYP2C9 metabolizers based on genotype or previous history/experience with other CYP2C9 substrates (such as warfarin, phenytoin) should be administered celecoxib with caution. Consider starting treatment at half the lowest

recommended dose in poor metabolizers (i.e. CYP2C9✱3/✱3). Alternative management should be considered in JRA patients identified to be CYP2C9 poor metabolizers [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].

### Influence of creatinine versus glomerular filtration rate on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug prescriptions in chronic kidney disease [^112NHusj]. American Journal of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, are generally contraindicated in chronic kidney disease (CKD). This investigation sought to identify the frequency of NSAID/COX-2 prescription and to determine the influence of serum creatinine (Cr) versus estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) on this practice pattern.

Methods

An established Veterans Health Administration CKD safety cohort (n = 70,154) was examined to determine the frequency of NSAID/COX-2 in fiscal year 2005 (FY05) for up to 30 days preceding the index hospitalization and as many as 365 days during that year. Binomial regression was used to determine adjusted prevalence ratios for prescription of NSAID/COX-2 with respect to continuous eGFR measurement and serum Cr categories. CKD was defined as eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2).

Results

15.4% of the subjects had an NSAID/COX-2 prescription during the observation period. The proportion of these prescribed agents decreased with declining renal function, but remained significant at any stage of CKD given the renal harm related to these medications. At specific GFR estimates, serum Cr remained a significant predictor of NSAID/COX-2 prescription. At GFR set at 42 ml/min/1.73 m(2), the predicted proportion of prescribed NSAID/COX-2 was 0.29 (95% CI 0.24, 0.36), 0.23 (95% CI 0.22, 0.26), 0.20 (95% CI 0.19, 0.22), and 0.12 (95% CI 0.10, 0.14) for Cr strata of ≤ 1.3, 1.4–1.6, 1.7–2.1, and ≥ 2.2 mg/dl, respectively (all p < 0.05).

Conclusion

A significant proportion of individuals with CKD continue to be prescribed NSAID/COX-2 and serum Cr remains an influential guide to NSAID/COX-2 prescription, even in GFR ranges where these agents are ill advised.

Other subjects

Some guidelines issued recommendations on CKD-mineral bone disorder, patient education, and various issues pertaining to early or advanced CKD (Table 10). ACP and UMHS issued the general recommendation to avoid nephrotoxic medication, whereas NICE recommended using NSAID with caution. Further subjects were treatment objectives for diabetes and congestive heart failure, low protein diet, statin use, hyperuricemia, oral bicarbonate and antiplatelets and anticoagulants.

NSAIDs in chronic kidney disease — adverse effects and reversibility: NSAIDs may cause gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and kidney adverse events and, by blunting prostaglandin-associated regulation of renal hemodynamics, can induce renal ischemia. NSAIDs can also increase blood pressure, cause edema and sodium retention (mostly mild), induce hyperkalemia, and contribute to heart failure, and NSAID-induced kidney injury is typically reversible with prompt discontinuation.
