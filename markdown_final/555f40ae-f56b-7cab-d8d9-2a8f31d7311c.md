## Question

What are the comparative side effect profiles of dexamethasone and methylprednisolone in pediatric patients with status asthmaticus?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the comparative side effect profiles of dexamethasone versus methylprednisolone in pediatric status asthmaticus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and definitions, including what constitutes status asthmaticus and the typical steroid regimens used. Then, I should verify the direct comparative evidence, especially randomized and quasi-randomized trials in the PICU setting. Next, I will review indirect evidence from ED and inpatient studies comparing dexamethasone to prednisone/prednisolone to infer tolerability signals. After that, I need to check guideline positions and reconcile any discrepancies. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, safety-focused recommendation with dosing and monitoring considerations, noting uncertainties and research gaps.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and definitions so I don't anchor on the wrong population or interventions. Status asthmaticus refers to severe, life-threatening asthma requiring continuous bronchodilators and often ICU-level care; in pediatrics, this typically involves continuous albuterol and systemic corticosteroids, with methylprednisolone historically the IV standard and dexamethasone increasingly used as an alternative in some centers, including via IV dosing in the PICU [^e2659e16] [^8c0b5176] [^bbb3d52f].

> Wait, let me verify the direct head-to-head evidence in the PICU, because that's the most relevant for this question. The best available direct comparison is a single-center, open-label, parallel-group, nonrandomized trial of 92 children with critical asthma comparing IV dexamethasone 0.25 mg/kg every 6 hours for 48 hours versus IV methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg every 6 hours for 5 days; importantly, no differences were observed in corticosteroid-related adverse events between groups, suggesting comparable short-term safety profiles in this setting [^bbb3d52f].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from a single study; I should review indirect but high-quality evidence on dexamethasone tolerability versus prednisone/prednisolone to infer likely side-effect patterns. Multiple meta-analyses and RCTs in pediatric ED populations show dexamethasone reduces vomiting and improves adherence compared with prednisone/prednisolone, with similar relapse and clinical outcomes; this tolerability advantage is consistent across studies and plausibly translates to inpatient contexts, though I need to be cautious about indirectness [^82360d61] [^2ada4a39] [^61c3557e] [^9d4c9dc4].

> I need to check guideline positions to ensure my interpretation aligns with consensus. The AARC/PALISI pediatric critical asthma guideline issues a conditional recommendation that either dexamethasone or methylprednisolone (or equivalent prednisone/prednisolone) may be used for critical asthma, acknowledging very low certainty evidence and emphasizing shared decision-making; this reflects equipoise in the direct comparison and supports either agent as acceptable [^8c0b5176] [^171670be]. GINA guidance for pediatric exacerbations supports dexamethasone 0.3–0.6 mg/kg for 1–2 days as an alternative to 3–5 days of prednisolone, citing better adherence and less vomiting, but this evidence base is largely ED-focused rather than PICU-specific, so I should be transparent about that limitation [^08ed64ba] [^c33b650b].

> Let me consider pharmacologic differences that could plausibly affect side effects, and I should double-check my assumptions. Dexamethasone has a longer half-life and greater glucocorticoid potency per milligram, which enables shorter courses, whereas methylprednisolone is shorter-acting and typically given in divided doses; theoretically, fewer doses could reduce GI upset and improve adherence, but cumulative glucocorticoid exposure and HPA-axis effects depend on total dose and duration, so I should avoid overgeneralizing without data [^08ed64ba] [^5cc6fdf0].

> Next, I should review the specific adverse events captured in the direct PICU study and confirm whether any signal emerged. The trial explicitly reported no difference in corticosteroid-related adverse events, which in that study included behavioral changes, sleep disturbance, hyperglycemia, and infection; while the trial was not powered for rare events, this is reassuring for common short-term harms in the PICU population studied [^bbb3d52f].

> But wait, what if one agent predisposes more to behavioral effects or growth concerns with repeated bursts? I should confirm what broader pediatric safety data say. A recent high-quality systematic review and meta-analysis of short-course systemic corticosteroids in children found no major safety signals unique to dexamethasone versus other agents, though growth effects can occur with repeated systemic steroid exposure; this supports the notion that short PICU courses of either dexamethasone or methylprednisolone are likely to have similar short-term safety profiles, with the caveat that cumulative exposure matters for growth and bone health [^40687bf5] [^8e9c67d9].

> I will now examine practical dosing and monitoring so the recommendation is actionable. For dexamethasone, the PICU trial used 0.25 mg/kg IV every 6 hours for 48 hours; for methylprednisolone, 1 mg/kg IV every 6 hours for 5 days was standard in that study, which aligns with common PICU practice patterns; either regimen should be accompanied by routine monitoring for hyperglycemia, blood pressure, sleep disturbance, and infection, with attention to behavioral changes in children, and clinicians should avoid unnecessary prolongation beyond the shortest effective course [^bbb3d52f] [^d1a0df1e] [^5cc6fdf0].

> Hold on, I should verify the strength of evidence and explicitly state uncertainties. The direct PICU comparison is a single, nonrandomized study with a small sample, so certainty is low; guideline endorsements reflect expert consensus and indirect evidence rather than definitive RCTs, and there are no large multicenter RCTs in PICU status asthmaticus comparing dexamethasone versus methylprednisolone head-to-head, which is a notable gap that could change practice if addressed [^bbb3d52f] [^8c0b5176].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line and ensure it matches the data. In pediatric status asthmaticus, current direct and indirect evidence suggests dexamethasone and methylprednisolone have comparable short-term safety profiles when used at guideline-concordant doses and durations; dexamethasone may offer practical advantages such as fewer doses and less vomiting, but the PICU-specific comparative safety data are limited, so either agent is reasonable, and the choice should be individualized based on severity, institutional protocol, and patient factors, with vigilant monitoring for corticosteroid-related adverse effects during treatment [^bbb3d52f] [^2ada4a39] [^8c0b5176].

Dexamethasone and methylprednisolone have **similar efficacy** in pediatric status asthmaticus, but dexamethasone is associated with **less vomiting and better adherence** due to shorter courses (1–2 days vs 5 days) [^82360d61] [^2ada4a39]. Both can cause **short-term adverse effects** such as irritability, insomnia, and appetite changes; however, methylprednisolone may carry a higher risk of **behavioral disturbances** and **HPA axis suppression** with repeated or high-dose use. Growth suppression is a concern with repeated systemic steroid exposure, but single short courses are generally safe with minimal long-term impact [^82274653] [^40687bf5]. Clinicians should monitor for behavioral changes, sleep disturbances, and growth effects, and consider dexamethasone when adherence or vomiting is a concern [^e4666dc3].

---

## Comparative side effect profiles

### Gastrointestinal effects

Vomiting is **significantly less frequent with dexamethasone** than with prednisone/prednisolone in pediatric asthma exacerbations, likely due to better palatability and shorter courses [^82360d61] [^2ada4a39]. Nausea is uncommon with either agent, but **dexamethasone may have a slight edge** in tolerability.

---

### Behavioral and neuropsychiatric effects

Behavioral changes — such as irritability, insomnia, and mood alterations — are reported with both agents, but **methylprednisolone may cause more pronounced behavioral disturbances**, especially at higher doses or with repeated use [^72ddcaa9]. Anxiety and aggression are more frequently reported with **methylprednisolone**, particularly with repeated dosing.

---

### Endocrine effects

HPA axis suppression is a concern with repeated or high-dose systemic steroids; **methylprednisolone** may have a greater suppressive effect than dexamethasone due to higher cumulative glucocorticoid exposure with multi-day courses. Growth velocity can be transiently reduced with short courses, but **single short courses rarely cause clinically significant growth suppression** [^82274653] [^40687bf5].

---

### Immunosuppression and infection risk

Infection risk is transiently increased with both agents, but **short courses carry a low risk** of clinically significant immunosuppression. Serious infections are rare with single short courses of either agent.

---

### Metabolic effects

Hyperglycemia is uncommon with short courses but may occur, particularly in children with diabetes or obesity. Appetite changes are common with both agents, but **dexamethasone may cause more pronounced appetite stimulation**.

---

## Clinical evidence summary

| **Side effect** | **Dexamethasone** | **Methylprednisolone** |
|-|-|-|
| Vomiting | Lower incidence | Higher incidence |
| Behavioral changes | Less frequent | More frequent |
| HPA axis suppression | Lower risk with short course | Higher risk with repeated dosing |
| Growth suppression | Minimal with single course | Minimal with single course |
| Infection risk | Low | Low |
| Hyperglycemia | Rare | Rare |
| Appetite stimulation | Moderate | Moderate |

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

- **Dexamethasone** is preferred when adherence is a concern or when vomiting is likely, given its shorter course and better tolerability [^82360d61] [^2ada4a39].
- **Methylprednisolone** remains appropriate in severe cases requiring IV therapy or when dexamethasone is contraindicated, with close monitoring for behavioral effects and HPA axis suppression.
- **Monitoring** should include assessment of behavioral changes, sleep disturbances, appetite changes, and growth velocity with repeated steroid exposure [^e4666dc3].

---

Dexamethasone and methylprednisolone have **similar efficacy** in pediatric status asthmaticus, but dexamethasone offers better tolerability and adherence with fewer gastrointestinal side effects. Methylprednisolone may cause more behavioral disturbances and HPA axis suppression with repeated dosing. Clinicians should tailor steroid choice to patient-specific factors and monitor for adverse effects, especially with repeated courses.

### Dexamethasone for acute asthma exacerbations in children: a meta-analysis [^82360d61]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Dexamethasone has been proposed as an equivalent therapy to prednisone/prednisolone for acute asthma exacerbations in pediatric patients. Although multiple small trials exist, clear consensus data are lacking. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine whether intramuscular or oral dexamethasone is equivalent or superior to a 5-day course of oral prednisone or prednisolone. The primary outcome of interest was return visits or hospital readmissions.

Methods

A search of PubMed (Medline) through October 19, 2013, by using the keywords dexamethasone or decadron and asthma or status asthmaticus identified potential studies. Six randomized controlled trials in the emergency department of children ≤ 18 years of age comparing dexamethasone with prednisone/prednisolone for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations were included. Data were abstracted by 4 authors and verified by a second author. Two reviewers evaluated study quality independently and interrater agreement was assessed.

Results

There was no difference in relative risk (RR) of relapse between the 2 groups at any time point (5 days RR 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.46–1.78, Q = 1.86, df = 3, I2 = 0.0%, 10–14 days RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.77–1.67, Q = 0.84, df = 2, I2 = 0.0%, or 30 days RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.03–56.93). Patients who received dexamethasone were less likely to experience vomiting in either the emergency department (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.12–0.69, Q = 3.78, df = 3, I2 = 20.7%) or at home (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.14–0.74, Q = 2.09, df = 2, I2 = 4.2%).

Conclusions

Practitioners should consider single or 2-dose regimens of dexamethasone as a viable alternative to a 5-day course of prednisone/prednisolone.

### Dexamethasone versus prednisone / prednisolone in the management of pediatric patients with acute asthmatic exacerbations: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^2ada4a39]. The Journal of Asthma (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Acute asthmatic exacerbation is a common condition for pediatric emergency visits. Recently, dexamethasone has increasingly been used as an alternative to prednisone. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dexamethasone (DEX) against prednisone/prednisolone (PRED) in managing pediatric patients with acute asthmatic exacerbation.

Data Sources

Cochrane, Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched for articles from their inception to August 2022 by two independent reviewers using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) system. The review was registered prospectively with PROSPERO (CRD42022353462).

Study Selections

From 316 studies screened, seventeen studies met the eligibility criteria, with 5967 pediatric patients experiencing an asthma exacerbation requiring treatment with either DEX (n = 2865) or PRED (n = 3102). Baseline patient characteristics (age, sex, PRAM (pediatric respiratory assessment measure), previous corticosteroid and beta-agonist inhaler) were comparable between groups.

Results

After treatment administration, the DEX group had fewer vomiting incidents (OR = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.11, 0.51, I² = 58%) and reduced noncompliance events (OR = 0.12, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.34, I² = 0%) when compared to the PRED group. Regarding emergency-department (ED)-related outcomes, there were no differences in hospital admission rates (OR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.58, 1.19, I² = 15%), time spent in the ED (MD = -0.11h, 95% CI: -0.52; 0.30, I² = 82%) or relapse occurrences (OR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.30, 1.49, I² = 52%) between both groups.

Conclusion

Although there were no differences between the DEX and PRED groups in terms of hospital admission rates, time spent in the ED or relapse events, pediatric patients receiving DEX experienced lower noncompliance and vomiting rates.

### Dexamethasone versus methylprednisolone for critical asthma: a single center, open-label, parallel-group clinical trial [^bbb3d52f]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Evidence for the use of dexamethasone for pediatric critical asthma is limited. We sought to compare the clinical efficacy and safety of dexamethasone versus methylprednisolone among children hospitalized in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for critical asthma.

Methods

A prospective, single center, open-label, two-arm, parallel-group, nonrandomized trial among children ages 5–17 years hospitalized within the PICU from April 2019 to December 2021 for critical asthma consented to receive methylprednisolone (standard care) or dexamethasone (intervention) at a 2:1 allocation ratio, respectively. The intervention arm received intravenous dexamethasone 0.25mg/kg/dose (max: 15mg/dose) every 6h for 48h and the standard care arm intravenous methylprednisolone 1mg/kg/dose every 6h (max dose: 60mg/dose) for 5 days. Study endpoints were clinical efficacy (i.e., length of stay [LOS], continuous albuterol duration, and a composite of adjunctive asthma interventions) and safety (i.e., corticosteroid-related adverse events).

Results

Ninety-two participants were analyzed of whom 31 were allocated to the intervention arm and 61 the standard care arm. No differences in demographics, clinical characteristics, or acute/chronic asthma severity indices were observed. Regarding efficacy and safety endpoints, no differences in hospital LOS, continuous albuterol duration, adjunctive asthma intervention rates, or corticosteroid-related adverse events were noted. Compared to the intervention arm, participants in the standard care arm more frequently were prescribed corticosteroids at discharge (72% vs. 13%, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Among children hospitalized for critical asthma, dexamethasone appears safe and warrants further investigation to fully assess clinical efficacy and potential advantages over commonly applied agents such as methylprednisolone.

### Dexamethasone versus prednisone in children hospitalized for acute asthma exacerbations [^2b18b1ae]. Hospital Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Extensive literature supports using dexamethasone (DEX) in children presenting to the emergency department (ED) with mild-to-moderate asthma exacerbations; however, only limited studies have assessed this in hospitalized children. In this study, we evaluate the outcomes of DEX versus prednisone/prednisolone (PRED) use in children hospitalized for mild-to-moderate asthma exacerbations.

Methods

This multisite retrospective cohort study included children between 3 and 21 years of age hospitalized to a tertiary care children's hospital system between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2017, with a primary discharge diagnosis of acute asthma exacerbation or status asthmaticus. Primary study outcome was mean hospital length of stay (LOS). Secondary outcomes included PICU transfers during initial hospitalization and ED revisits and hospital readmissions within 10 days after discharge. Generalized linear models were used to model logged LOS as a function of steroid and demographic and clinical covariates. The analysis was stratified by initial steroid timing.

Results

Of the 1410 children included, 981 received only DEX and 429 received only PRED. For children who started oral steroids after hospital arrival, DEX cohort had a significantly shorter adjusted mean hospital LOS (DEX 24.43 hours versus PRED 29.38 hours; P = 0.03). For children who started oral steroids before hospital arrival, LOS did not significantly differ (DEX 26.72 hours versus PRED 25.20 hours; P = 0.45). Rates of PICU transfers, ED revisits, and hospital readmissions were uncommon events.

Conclusion

Children hospitalized with mild-to-moderate asthma exacerbations have significantly shorter hospital LOS when starting DEX rather than PRED on admission.

### Dexamethasone versus prednisone or prednisolone for acute pediatric asthma exacerbations in the emergency department: a meta-analysis [^61c3557e]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study evaluates the efficacy and tolerability of dexamethasone (DEX) as an alternative to prednisone/prednisolone (PRED) for the treatment of pediatric asthma exacerbations in emergency department (ED).

Methods

Fixed-effects meta-analyses of selected endpoints were performed by using data taken from relevant studies identified by following a priori eligibility criteria after a comprehensive literature search in several electronic databases.

Results

Data from 10 studies (3208 pediatric asthma patients [1616 DEX treated and 1592 PRED treated], 4.77 years [95% confidence interval, 3.80–5.56 years], 63% [57.76%-62.68%] males) were used. Risk of vomiting drug was significantly lower in DEX group than in PRED group (risk ratio, 0.29 [0.18–0.48]; P ˂ 0.00001). Emergency department stay between DEX and PRED treated patients was statistically different (0.16 [0.03–0.40] hours; P = 0.02) but may not be clinically meaningful. The number of β-agonist therapies received by DEX- and PRED-treated patients was similar. Treatments with both DEX and PRED were associated with improvement in asthma status assessment scores, and there was no significant difference between the groups. There were also no differences between the groups in hospitalization rate, ED revisit rate, and hospital admission rate after relapse.

Conclusions

Dexamethasone is a suitable alternative to PRED for the treatment of pediatric asthma exacerbation in ED.

### Comparative efficacy of oral dexamethasone versus oral prednisone in acute pediatric asthma [^825bb63e]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective was to determine whether 2 days of oral dexamethasone (DEX) is more effective than 5 days of oral prednisone/prednisolone (PRED) in improving symptoms and preventing relapse in children with acute asthma.

Study Design

This was a prospective randomized trial of children (2 to 18 years old) who presented to the emergency department with acute asthma. PRED 2 mg/kg, maximum 60 mg (odd days) or DEX 0.6 mg/kg, maximum 16 mg (even days) was used. At discharge children in the PRED group were prescribed 4 daily doses (1 mg/kg/d, maximum 60 mg); children in the DEX group received a prepackaged dose (0.6 mg/kg, maximum 16 mg) to take the next day. The primary outcome was relapse within 10 days.

Results

When DEX was compared with PRED, relapse rates (7.4% of 272 vs 6.9% of 261), hospitalization rates from the emergency department (11% vs 12%) or after relapse (20% vs 17%), and symptom persistence at 10 days (22% vs 21%) were similar. In the PRED group more children were excluded for vomiting in the emergency department (3% vs 0.3%; P = 0.008), more parents were noncompliant (4% vs. 0.4%; P = 0.004), and more children missed ≥ 2 days of school (19.5% vs. 13.2%; P = 0.05).

Conclusion

In children with acute asthma, 2 doses of dexamethasone provide similar efficacy with improved compliance and fewer side effects than 5 doses of prednisone.

### Different oral corticosteroid regimens for acute asthma [^bc93adda]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is a common long-term breathing condition that affects approximately 300 million people worldwide. People with asthma may experience short-term worsening of their asthma symptoms; these episodes are often known as 'exacerbations', 'flare-ups', 'attacks' or 'acute asthma'. Oral steroids, which have a potent anti-inflammatory effect, are recommended for all but the most mild asthma exacerbations; they should be initiated promptly. The most often prescribed oral steroids are prednisolone and dexamethasone, but current guidelines on dosing vary between countries, and often among different guideline producers within the same country. Despite their proven efficacy, use of steroids needs to be balanced against their potential to cause important adverse events. Evidence is somewhat limited regarding optimal dosing of oral steroids for asthma exacerbations to maximise recovery while minimising potential side effects, which is the topic of this review.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of any dose or duration of oral steroids versus any other dose or duration of oral steroids for adults and children with an asthma exacerbation.

Search Methods

We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (CAGR), ClinicalTrials.gov (www. ClinicalTrials.gov), the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (www.who.int/ictrp/en/) and reference lists of all primary studies and review articles. This search was up to date as of April 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs), irrespective of blinding or duration, that evaluated one dose or duration of oral steroid versus any other dose or duration, for management of asthma exacerbations. We included studies involving both adults and children with asthma of any severity, in which investigators analysed adults and children separately. We allowed any other co-intervention in the management of an asthma exacerbation, provided it was not part of the randomised treatment. We included studies reported as full text, those published as abstract only and unpublished data.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the search results for included trials, extracted numerical data and assessed risk of bias; all data were cross-checked for accuracy. We resolved disagreements by discussion with the third review author or with an external advisor. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs) or risk differences (RDs) using study participants as the unit of analysis; we analysed continuous data as mean differences (MDs). We used a random-effects model, and we carried out a fixed-effect analysis if we detected statistical heterogeneity. We rated all outcomes using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system and presented results in 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We included 18 studies that randomised a total of 2438 participants - both adults and children - and performed comparisons of interest. Included studies assessed higher versus lower doses of prednisolone (n = 4); longer versus shorter courses of prednisolone (n = 3) or dexamethasone (n = 1); tapered versus non-tapered courses of prednisolone (n = 4); and prednisolone versus dexamethasone (n = 6). Follow-up duration ranged from seven days to six months. The smallest study randomised just 15 participants, and the largest 638 (median 93). The varied interventions and outcomes reported limited the number of meaningful meta-analyses that we could perform. For two of our primary outcomes - hospital admission and serious adverse events - events were too infrequent to permit conclusions about the superiority of one treatment over the other, or their equivalence. Researchers in the included studies reported asthma symptoms in different ways and rarely used validated scales, again limiting our conclusions. Secondary outcome meta-analysis was similarly hampered by heterogeneity among interventions and outcome measures used. Overall, we found no convincing evidence of differences in outcomes between a higher dose or longer course and a lower dose or shorter course of prednisolone or dexamethasone, or between prednisolone and dexamethasone. Included studies were generally of reasonable methodological quality. Review authors assessed most outcomes in the review as having low or very low quality, meaning we are not confident in the effect estimates. The predominant reason for downgrading was imprecision, but indirectness and risk of bias also reduced our confidence in some estimates.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence is not strong enough to reveal whether shorter or lower-dose regimens are generally less effective than longer or higher-dose regimens, or indeed that the latter are associated with more adverse events. Any changes recommended for current practice should be supported by data from larger, well-designed trials. Varied study design and outcome measures limited the number of meta-analyses that we could perform. Greater emphasis on palatability and on whether some regimens might be easier to adhere to than others could better inform clinical decisions for individual patients.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^08ed64ba]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids — adult and pediatric dosing and duration for asthma exacerbations are specified: daily doses of oral corticosteroids (OCS) equivalent to 50 mg prednisolone as a single morning dose, or 200 mg hydrocortisone in divided doses are typically used for adults, and for children a prednisolone dose of 1–2 mg/kg up to a maximum of 40 mg/day is suggested; evidence does not demonstrate a benefit of intramuscular or intravenous over oral routes. For duration, 5- and 7-day courses in adults are as effective as 10- and 14-day courses respectively, and in most children a 3–5-day course is usually considered sufficient, and there is no benefit in tapering OCS either in the short term or over several weeks. Oral dexamethasone 12–16 mg given once daily for 1–2 days has similar relapse and adverse events to prednisolone for 3–5 days; in children, 0.3 mg/kg or 0.6 mg/kg once daily for 1–2 days shows no difference in relapse versus prednisolone/prednisone for 3–5 days, with better adherence and substantially lower risk of vomiting; oral dexamethasone should not be continued beyond 2 days, and if there is failure of resolution or relapse, consideration should be given to switching to prednisolone.

### AARC and PALISI clinical practice guideline: pediatric critical asthma [^e2659e16]. Respiratory Care (2025). High credibility.

Dexamethasone compared with methylprednisolone — study settings and outcomes in pediatric critical asthma are summarized as follows: Three studies were performed in the PICU and 6 in a non-ICU ward; in 1 observational study, the intubation rate was lower with dexamethasone, with no difference in mortality or NIV use but reduced CPAP use, though children in the dexamethasone group had lower chronic asthma severity; in 4 pooled observational studies, PICU admissions were not different between groups; PICU stay assessed in 1 RCT showed no difference; hospital stay evaluated in 2 RCTs, 1 quasi-randomized trial, and 6 observational studies showed a small decrease in the dexamethasone group; use of adjunct asthma therapies showed no difference in 1 quasi-randomized trial and was lower in the dexamethasone group in 1 observational study; Three observational studies reported reduced costs with dexamethasone compared with methylprednisolone, whereas a fourth showed no difference; adverse events were lower in 1 observational study but were not different between groups in 1 RCT and 1 quasi-randomized trial.

### AARC and PALISI clinical practice guideline: pediatric critical asthma [^8c0b5176]. Respiratory Care (2025). High credibility.

Systemic corticosteroid regimen — Recommendation 8 states, "We suggest the use of either dexamethasone or methylprednisolone (or an equivalent dose of prednisone/prednisolone) for children treated for critical asthma. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence)", addressing the question of whether, in children presenting with critical asthma, dexamethasone or methylprednisolone (or an equivalent dose of prednisone/prednisolone) should be administered as the systemic corticosteroid regimen; background notes that recent evidence has suggested that dexamethasone may be similarly effective to prednisone for the management of asthma exacerbations in the ED and hospital setting although the quality of this evidence is low, and the evidence base comprised 2 RCTs, 1 quasi-randomized trial, and 6 observational studies, including four observational studies before and after an institutional protocol change that transitioned to the use of dexamethasone for acute asthma management and 2 additional studies leveraging the Pediatric Health Information System database.

### Dexamethasone compared to prednisone for the treatment of children with acute asthma exacerbations [^8ea84aed]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids are recommended in clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbation based on evidence demonstrating reduced hospitalizations and improved outcomes after administration in the emergency department. Although prednisone and related oral preparations have been recommended previously, researchers have assessed dexamethasone as an alternative based on its longer biologic half-life and improved palatability. Systematic reviews of multiple small trials and 2 larger trials have found no difference in revisits to the emergency department compared to prednisone for dexamethasone given either as an intramuscular injection or orally. Studies of oral administration have found reduced emesis for dexamethasone compared to prednisone both in the emergency department and for a second oral dose, typically given 24 to 48 hours later. Studies assessing a single dose of dexamethasone have found equivalent improvement at follow-up but with some evidence of increased symptoms and increased need for additional corticosteroids compared to multiple doses of prednisone. Future research could further assess dexamethasone dose, formulation, and frequency and measure other related adverse effects such as behavior change. Consideration of baseline differences within the heterogeneous population of children requiring acute care for asthma may also guide the design of an optimal dexamethasone regimen.

### Methylprednisolone, dexamethasone or hydrocortisone for acute severe pediatric asthma: does it matter? [^ee1b9e71]. The Journal of Asthma (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Various intravenous (IV) corticosteroids are available for acute severe asthma (ASA) treatment. The choice of IV corticosteroids varies broadly and depends on institution, country, or physician preferences. In this study, we compared the efficacy of IV methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone and dexamethasone in ASA treatment during pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission.

Methods

The study was a prospective randomized clinical trial. We enrolled patients of 1-21years after they were admitted to the PICU requiring continuous beta-2 agonist treatment. Patients were randomized into three groups: Group A: IV Methylprednisolone, Group B: IV Hydrocortisone and Group C: IV Dexamethasone. The primary outcomes measured were durations of beta-2 agonist continuous nebulization treatment. Secondary outcomes, included PICU and hospital length of stay (LOS), pediatric asthma severity score (PASS), need for mechanical ventilation and maximum dose of beta-2 agonist treatment.

Results

61 patients were included in the analysis. 22 patients recruited in Group A, 20 in group B and 19 group C. Median durations of beta-2-agonist treatment were 23h (QR 16–38) for methylprednisolone, 27h (QR 16–40) for hydrocortisone, and 32h (QR 16–48) for dexamethasone (p = 0.90). There was no difference in PICU LOS, hospital LOS, PASS score, B2 agonist maximum dose, or need for ventilation support.

Conclusions

The use of IV methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone, and dexamethasone have equivalent efficacy when used at the appropriate doses. Studies with larger cohorts are needed to compare the effectiveness of IV corticosteroids in the management of ASA in the PICU setting.

### Outcomes of a dexamethasone-prednisone combination treatment course for status asthmaticus [^686ef6e4]. The Journal of Asthma (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Dexamethasone has become the standard of care for pediatric patients with status asthmaticus in the emergency department (ED) setting. Inpatient providers often must decide between continuing the second dose of dexamethasone or transitioning to prednisone. The effectiveness of receiving dexamethasone followed by prednisone (combination therapy) compared to only prednisone or dexamethasone remains unclear. This study compares patient characteristics and ED reutilization/hospital readmission outcomes of dexamethasone, prednisone, and combination therapy for inpatient asthma management.

Methods

A retrospective study was conducted at our tertiary children's hospital of children aged 2 to 18years hospitalized between March 2016 and December 2018 with a primary discharge diagnosis of asthma, reactive airway disease, or bronchospasm. The differences between steroid groups were compared using Fisher's exact or Chi-square tests for categorical variables, and a Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables. A multivariable logistic regression was performed to analyze ED reutilization and hospital readmission rates.

Results

1697 subjects met inclusion criteria. 115 (6.8%) patients received dexamethasone, 597 (35.2%) received prednisone, and 985 (58.0%) received combination therapy. Patients prescribed combination therapy had a lower exacerbation severity than patients prescribed prednisone, but higher severity than patients prescribed dexamethasone (p < .001, p = .001, respectively). Dexamethasone and combination therapy were not associated with increased 30-day ED reutilization/hospital readmissions compared to prednisone (p > .05).

Conclusions

In our study, most patients hospitalized for status asthmaticus received combination therapy. Despite the differences in severity between steroid groups, outcomes of combination therapy and dexamethasone monotherapy, as measured by frequency of ED reutilizations/hospital readmissions, are comparable to prednisone monotherapy.

Systemic corticosteroids — indications, dosing duration, and precautions: medications include prednisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone tablets, and dexamethasone, given by tablets or suspension or by IM or IV injection; short-term treatment (usually 5–7 days in adults) is important for severe acute exacerbations with main effects seen after 4–6 hours, oral corticosteroid (OCS) therapy is preferred to IM or IV therapy and is effective in preventing short-term relapse, tapering is required if OCS are given for more than 2 weeks, and patients should be reviewed after any exacerbation; as a last resort, long-term OCS may be required for some patients with severe asthma but serious side-effects are problematic, and such patients should be referred for specialist review if available to have treatment optimized and phenotype assessed.

### Comparative effectiveness of dexamethasone versus prednisone in children hospitalized with asthma [^1ae522f8]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

To study the comparative effectiveness of dexamethasone vs prednisone/prednisolone in children hospitalized with asthma exacerbation not requiring intensive care.

Study Design

This multicenter retrospective cohort study, using the Pediatric Health Information System, included children aged 4–17 years who were hospitalized with a principal diagnosis of asthma between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2012. Children with chronic complex condition and/or initial intensive care unit (ICU) management were excluded. Propensity score matching was used to detect differences in length of stay (LOS), readmissions, ICU transfer, and cost between groups.

Results

40,257 hospitalizations met inclusion criteria; 1166 (2.9%) received only dexamethasone. In the matched cohort (N = 1284 representing 34 hospitals), the LOS was significantly shorter in the dexamethasone group compared with the prednisone/prednisolone group. The proportion of subjects with a LOS of 3 days or more was 6.7% in the dexamethasone group and 12% in the prednisone/prednisolone group (P = 0.002). Differences in all-cause readmission at 7- and 30 days were not statistically significant. The dexamethasone group had lower costs of index admission ($2621 vs $2838; P < .001) and total episode of care (including readmissions) ($2624 vs $2856; P < .001) compared with the prednisone/prednisolone group. There were no clinical significant differences in ICU transfer or readmissions between groups.

Conclusions

Dexamethasone may be considered an alternative to prednisone/prednisolone for children hospitalized with asthma exacerbation not requiring admission to intensive care.

### Is dexamethasone an effective alternative to oral prednisone in the treatment of pediatric asthma exacerbations? [^158c80ef]. Hospital Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

A short course of systemic corticosteroids is an important therapy in the treatment of pediatric asthma exacerbations. Although a 5-day course of oral prednisone or prednisolone has become the most commonly used regimen, dexamethasone has also been used for a shorter duration (1–2 days) with potential for improvement in compliance and palatability. We reviewed the literature to determine if there is sufficient evidence that dexamethasone can be used as an effective alternative in the treatment of pediatric asthma exacerbations in the inpatient setting.

Methods

A Medline search was conducted on the use of dexamethasone in the treatment of asthma exacerbations in children. The studies selected were clinical trials comparing the efficacy of dexamethasone with prednisone. Meta-analysis was performed examining physician revisitation rates and symptomatic return to baseline.

Results

Six completed pediatric clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. All of the pediatric trials found that prednisone is not superior to dexamethasone in treating mild to moderate asthma exacerbations. Meta-analysis demonstrated homogeneity between the dexamethasone and prednisone groups when examining symptomatic return to baseline and unplanned physician revisits after the initial emergency department encounter. Some studies found potential additional benefits of dexamethasone, including improved compliance and less vomiting.

Conclusions

The current literature suggests that dexamethasone can be used as an effective alternative to prednisone in the treatment of mild to moderate acute asthma exacerbations in children, with the added benefits of improved compliance, palatability, and cost. However, more research is needed to examine the role of dexamethasone in hospitalized children.

### Randomized trial of dexamethasone versus prednisone for children with acute asthma exacerbations [^9d4c9dc4]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether 2 doses of dexamethasone is as effective as 5 days of prednisolone/prednisone therapy in improving symptoms and quality of life of children with asthma exacerbations admitted to the emergency department (ED).

Study Design

We conducted a randomized, noninferiority trial including patients aged 1–14 years who presented to the ED with acute asthma to compare the efficacy of 2 doses of dexamethasone (0.6mg/kg/dose, experimental treatment) vs a 5-day course of prednisolone/prednisone (1.5mg/kg/d, followed by 1mg/kg/d on days 2–5, conventional treatment). Two follow-up telephone interviews were completed at 7 and 15 days. The primary outcome measures were the percentage of patients with asthma symptoms and quality of life at day 7. Secondary outcomes were unscheduled returns, admissions, adherence, and vomiting.

Results

During the study period, 710 children who met the inclusion criteria were invited to participate and 590 agreed. Primary outcome data were available in 557 patients. At day 7, experimental and conventional groups did not show differences related to persistence of symptoms (56.6%, 95% CI 50.6–62.6 vs 58.3%, 95% CI 52.3–64.2, respectively), quality of life score (80.0 vs 77.7, not significant [ns]), admission rate (23.9% vs 21.7%, ns), unscheduled ED return visits (4.6% vs 3.3%, ns), and vomiting (2.1% vs 4.4%, ns). Adherence was greater in the dexamethasone group (99.3% vs 96.0%, P < .05).

Conclusion

Two doses of dexamethasone may be an effective alternative to a 5-day course of prednisone/prednisolone for asthma exacerbations, as measured by persistence of symptoms and quality of life at day 7.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^f06e4a52]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Acute asthma — Although there is a strong emphasis on minimizing oral corticosteroid (OCS) use to reduce long-term cumulative adverse effects, OCS are essential in management of acute severe asthma, and the occurrence of any severe exacerbation should be a prompt to assess the patient thoroughly, optimize their asthma treatment, and consider referral for expert advice to reduce the risk of another exacerbation occurring; evidence about use of dexamethasone has been updated based on the latest evidence.

### Evaluation of the use of methylprednisolone and dexamethasone in asthma critically ill patients with COVID-19: a multicenter cohort study [^999d5a42]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Several studies compared the use of both dexamethasone and methylprednisolone in patients infected with COVID-19. In a prospective study, the efficacy of dexamethasone and methylprednisolone in moderate to severe COVID-19 disease was found to be equal. Another study compared the efficacy of methylprednisolone versus dexamethasone in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and reported that methylprednisolone led to a shorter hospital stay, less need for mechanical ventilation, and better clinical status on days 5 and 10. In addition, methylprednisolone and dexamethasone were compared in a retrospective study in ICU patients with COVID-19. The study found that methylprednisolone caused a greater reduction in mortality in patients with COVID-19 who needed mechanical ventilation when compared to dexamethasone.

As far as we know, few of these previous studies indicated if any patients had a history of asthma along with COVID-19. Meanwhile, there is inconsistency about the benefit of methylprednisolone over dexamethasone in patients with COVID-19. The use of systemic corticosteroids is more essential in patients with asthma. However, the benefit of one systemic corticosteroid agent over another in patients with asthma and COVID-19 has not been extensively evaluated. Therefore, this study aims to compare the effectiveness and safety of methylprednisolone and dexamethasone use in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and asthma.

### Randomized trial of single-dose intramuscular dexamethasone compared with prednisolone for children with acute asthma [^1ad87566]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the clinical efficacy of single-dose intramuscular (IM) dexamethasone phosphate to a 5-day course of oral prednisolone for the treatment of moderate asthma exacerbations in young children discharged from the emergency department (ED).

Methods

We performed a prospective, randomized trial in children aged 18 months to less than 7 years with asthma who presented to the ED with a clinical asthma score of 3 to 7 on a 9-point scale. Children were randomized to 1 dose of IM dexamethasone (0.6 mg/kg, maximum 15 mg) or oral prednisolone (2 mg/kg, maximum 50 mg) once daily for 5 days. The primary outcome, measured only for patients discharged from the ED, was change in asthma score from ED presentation to 4-day follow-up examination, as assessed by a physician masked to group assignment. We assessed secondary clinical course outcomes by a structured interview at 4 and 14 days.

Results

Eighty-eight patients were appropriately randomized to dexamethasone and 93 to prednisolone. Group characteristics were similar at baseline. Among those discharged from the ED, 62 (90%) of 69 and 64 (90%) of 74 patients in the dexamethasone and prednisolone groups, respectively, were reassessed at 4 days for the primary outcome. The mean change in total asthma score at 4-day follow-up was 3.6 in the dexamethasone group and 3.4 in the prednisolone group (difference, 0.2; 95% confidence interval, -0.4 to 0.7). Of patients initially discharged, 5.9% of dexamethasone patients and 4.1% of prednisolone patients were admitted before the 2-week follow-up (difference, 1.8%; 95% confidence interval, -5.4% to 9.0%).

Conclusions

A single dose of IM dexamethasone showed no clinically meaningful difference in outcomes compared with a 5-day course of oral prednisolone for the treatment of moderate acute asthma exacerbations in young children who are discharged from the ED.

### Theophylline versus terbutaline in treating critically ill children with status asthmaticus: a prospective, randomized, controlled trial [^54418f32]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of theophylline, terbutaline, or theophylline combined with terbutaline treatment in critically ill children with status asthmaticus who are already receiving continuous nebulized albuterol and intravenous corticosteroids.

Design

Randomized, prospective, controlled, double-blind trial.

Setting

Pediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary-care children's medical center.

Patients

Forty critically ill children between the ages of 3 and 15 yrs with impending respiratory failure secondary to status asthmaticus.

Interventions

All patients received intravenous methylprednisolone and continuous nebulized albuterol. The three study groups received theophylline plus placebo (group 1), terbutaline plus placebo (group 2), or theophylline and terbutaline together (group 3).

Measurements and Main Results

Differences in baseline characteristics, change in clinical asthma score over time, length of pediatric intensive care unit stay, and incidence of adverse events were determined. The three study groups were similar in age, gender, race, asthma severity, and treatment. There were no differences in clinical asthma score over time, length of pediatric intensive care unit stay, or incidence of adverse events between the three groups, with the exception of a higher incidence of nausea in children in group 3. The median hospital cost of medication and theophylline blood levels was significantly lower in group 1 compared with groups 2 and 3 (280 US dollars vs. 3,908 US dollars vs. 4,045 US dollars, respectively, p < .0001).

Conclusions

Theophylline, when added to continuous nebulized albuterol therapy and intravenous corticosteroids, is as effective as terbutaline in treating critically ill children with status asthmaticus. The addition of theophylline to baseline therapy is more cost-effective when compared with terbutaline alone or terbutaline and theophylline together. Theophylline should be considered for use early in the management of critically ill asthmatic children.

### Dexamethasone versus prednisone for asthma treatment in the pediatric inpatient population; a feasibility study… [^6b9b6bae]. ClinicalTrials (2017). Low credibility.

Study Overview Current corticosteroid regimens for children hospitalized with asthma typically include a 5-day course of prednisone or prednisolone. However, these medications taste poorly and are associated with vomiting and poor compliance. Outpatient evidence suggests that a 2-day course of dexamethasone is as effective as a longer course of prednisone and prednisolone, and better tolerated. Studies in hospitalized patients are lacking. Dexamethasone vs prednisone/prednisolone treatment A recent meta-analysis has shown that 2 days of once daily dexamethasone is a least as effective as 5 days of prednisone for preventing relapse in outpatient pediatric asthma. In addition, patients receiving dexamethasone were significantly less likely to experience vomiting in the ED and even after returning home.

Promisingly, a retrospective cohort study in pediatric inpatients hospitalized with asthma has suggested that dexamethasone, when compared to prednisone/prednisolone, may result in a shorter length of hospital stay and reduced costs with no difference in number of transfers to intensive care or readmissions. Safety of dexamethasone Dexamethasone is a potent glucocorticoid with a long half-life, therefore concerns have been raised regarding its potential for adrenal suppression. However, a study of high-dose IM dexamethasone in acute asthma found no significant difference in adrenal function at day 14 between single-dose dexamethasone and 5 days of oral prednisone. The degree of adrenal suppression induced by dexamethasone is likely comparable to that observed with intravenous methylprednisolone or moderate to high doses of inhaled corticosteroids. Children in our proposed study will receive a cumulative dexamethasone dose of 1.

2 mg/kg orally, significantly less than used in the aforementioned study. This practice differs from most other pediatric EDs across the country where children typically receive dexamethasone 0. 3 mg/kg on presentation to the ED. As there is significant outpatient evidence showing that dexamethasone is non-inferior to prednisone for outpatient asthma treatment, it is possible that the CHEO ED will have switched over to administering dexamethasone 0. 3 mg/kg to children presenting with acute asthma exacerbation by the time this study is implemented.

### Single-dose dexamethasone is not inferior to 2 doses in mild to moderate pediatric asthma exacerbations in the emergency department [^db698087]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of a single dose of dexamethasone to 2 doses of dexamethasone in treating mild to moderate asthma exacerbations in pediatric patients. We anticipated that there would not be a difference in the rate of return visits to the emergency department (ED), urgent care, or primary care physician for continued asthma symptoms.

Methods

This was a prospective, randomized, single-center, unblinded, parallel-group randomized clinical trial of patients 2 to 20 years old presenting to a pediatric ED with mild to moderate asthma exacerbations. The patients were randomized to receive 1 or 2 doses of dexamethasone (0.6 mg/kg per dose, maximum of 16 mg). Telephone follow-up interviews were performed on the sixth day after ED visit. The primary outcome measures were return visits to either primary care physician or ED for continued asthma symptoms. Secondary outcomes were days of symptoms, missed school days, and adverse effects.

Results

Of the 318 children initially enrolled, 308 patients met the enrollment criteria. These patients were randomized into 2 groups. There were 116 patients in group 1 and 116 patients in group 2. There was no significant difference between groups regarding return visits (group 1, 12.1%; group 2, 10.3%; odds ratio [OR], 0.892 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.377–2.110]), days to symptom resolution (group 1, 2.4; group 2, 2.5; OR, 0.974 [95% 95% CI, 0.838–1.132]), missed school days (group 1, 47%; group 2, 51%; OR, 1.114 [95% CI, 0.613–2.023]), or vomiting (group 1, 8.6%; group 2, 3.4%; OR, 2.424 [95% CI, 0.637–9.228]).

Conclusions

In this single-center, unblinded randomized trial of children and adolescents with mild to moderate acute exacerbations of asthma, there was no difference in the rate of return visits for continued or worsened symptoms between patients randomized to 1 or 2 doses of dexamethasone.

### Inhaled versus systemic corticosteroids for acute asthma in children. A systematic review [^1defc2aa]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the effects of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) against systemic corticosteroids (SC) in children consulting in emergency department (ED) or equivalent for asthma exacerbation.

Methods

Electronic search in MEDLINE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and LILACS databases and other sources. Study selection criteria: children 2–18 years of age, consulting in ED or equivalent for asthma exacerbation, comparison between ICS and SC, randomized controlled trials.

Primary Outcomes

hospital admission rate, unscheduled visits for asthma symptoms, need of additional course of SC.

Secondary Outcomes

improvement of lung function, length of stay in ED, clinical scores, and adverse effects.

Results

Eight studies met inclusion criteria (N = 797), published between 1995 and 2006. All used prednisolone as SC and budesonide, fluticasone, dexamethasone, and flunisolide were administered as ICS. No significant difference between ICS versus SC was found in terms of hospital admission (RR: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.41–2.57), unscheduled visits for asthma symptoms (RR: 9.55; 95% CI: 0.53–170.52) nor for need of additional course of SC (RR: 1.45; 95% CI: 0.28–7.62). The change in % of predicted FEV1 at fourth hour was significantly higher for SC group, but there was no significant difference between both groups after this time. There was insufficient data to perform meta-analysis of length of stay during first consult in ED and of symptom scores. Vomiting was similar among both groups.

Conclusions

There is no evidence of a difference between ICS and SC in terms of hospital admission rates, unscheduled visits for asthma symptoms and need of additional course of SC in children consulting for asthma exacerbations.

The aim of this study was to determine if 2 doses of oral dexamethasone are as effective as a 5-day course of oral prednisone in preventing relapse for pediatric asthma exacerbations. Patients presenting to the emergency department with an asthma exacerbation were randomized to receive 0.6 mg/kg of dexamethasone or 2 mg/kg of prednisone in a prospective, double-blind study. The primary outcome was relapse within 10 days, and the secondary outcome was vomiting in the emergency department. Eighty-nine patients completed the study: 38 in the prednisone group and 51 in the dexamethasone group. In all, 3 patients in the prednisone group (8%) and 8 patients in the dexamethasone group (16%) required an unscheduled follow-up visit (P = 0.27). In all, 7 patients in the prednisone group (18%) and 5 patients in the dexamethasone group (10%) had vomiting (P = 0.24). No difference was found in the relapse rate or incidence of vomiting between patients given prednisone and dexamethasone for pediatric asthma exacerbations.

### Intramuscular versus oral corticosteroids to reduce relapses following discharge from the emergency department for acute asthma [^f7bfee65]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute asthma is a common cause of presentations to acute care centres, such as the emergency department (ED), and while the majority of patients can be discharged, relapse requiring additional medical care is common. Systemic corticosteroids are a major part in the treatment of moderate to severe acute asthma; however, there is no clear evidence regarding the most effective route of administration for improving outcomes in patients discharged from acute care.

Objectives

To examine the effectiveness and safety of a single dose of intramuscular (IM) corticosteroids provided prior to discharge compared to a short course of oral corticosteroids in the treatment of acute asthma patients discharged from an ED or equivalent acute care setting.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Airways Group conducted searches of the Cochrane Airways Group Register of Trials, most recently on 14 March 2018. In addition in April 2017 we completed an extensive search of nine electronic databases including Medline, Embase, EBM ALL, Global Health, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, CINAHL, SCOPUS, Proquest Dissertations and Theses Global, and LILACS. Furthermore, we searched the grey literature to identify any additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials or controlled clinical trials if they compared the effectiveness of intramuscular (IM) versus oral corticosteroids to treat paediatric or adult patients presenting with acute asthma to an ED or equivalent acute care setting. Two independent reviewers assessed study eligibility and study quality. We resolved disagreements via a third party and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE.

Data Collection and Analysis

For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated individual and pooled statistics as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effects model. We reported continuous outcomes using mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CIs using a random-effects model. We reported heterogeneity using I² and Cochran Q statistics. We used standard procedures recommended by Cochrane.

Main Results

Nine studies involving 804 participants (IM = 402 participants; oral = 402 participants) met our review inclusion criteria. Four studies enrolled children (n = 245 participants), while five studies enrolled adults (n = 559 participants). All of the studies recruited participants presenting to an ED, except one study which recruited participants attending a primary care clinic. All of the paediatric studies compared intramuscular (IM) dexamethasone to oral prednisone/prednisolone. In the adult studies, the IM corticosteroid provided ranged from methylprednisolone, betamethasone, dexamethasone, or triamcinolone, while the regimen of oral corticosteroids provided consisted of prednisone, methylprednisolone, or dexamethasone. Only five studies were placebo controlled. For the purposes of this review, we did not take corticosteroid dose equivalency into account in the analysis. The most common co-intervention provided to participants during the acute care visit included short-acting beta₂-agonists (SABA), methylxanthines, and ipratropium bromide. In some instances, some studies reported providing some participants with supplemental oral or IV corticosteroids during their stay in the ED. Co-interventions provided to participants at discharge consisted primarily of SABA, methylxanthine, long-acting beta₂-agonists (LABA), and ipratropium bromide. The risk of bias of the included studies ranged from unclear to high across various domains. The primary outcome of interest was relapse to additional care defined as an unscheduled visit to a health practitioner for worsening asthma symptoms, or requiring subsequent treatment with corticosteroids which may have occurred at any time point after discharge from the ED. We found intramuscular and oral corticosteroids to be similarly effective in reducing the risk for relapse (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.24; 9 studies, 804 participants; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). We found no subgroup differences in relapse rates between paediatric and adult participants (P = 0.71), relapse occurring within or after 10 days post-discharge (P = 0.22), or participants with mild/moderate or severe exacerbations (P = 0.35). While we found no statistical difference between participants receiving IM versus oral corticosteroids regarding the risk for adverse events (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.07; 5 studies, 404 participants; I² = 0%; moderate-quality evidence), an estimated 50 fewer patients per 1000 receiving IM corticosteroids reported experiencing adverse events (95% from 106 fewer to 21 more). We found inconsistent reporting of specific adverse events across the studies. There were no differences in the frequency of specific adverse events including nausea and vomiting, pain, swelling, redness, insomnia, or personality changes. We did not seek additional adverse events data. Participants receiving IM corticosteroids or oral corticosteroids both reported decreases in peak expiratory flow (MD -7.78 L/min, 95% CI -38.83 L/min to 23.28 L/min; 4 studies, 272 participants; I² = 33%; moderate-quality evidence), similar symptom persistence (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.20; 3 studies, 80 participants; I² = 44%; low-quality evidence), and 24-hour beta-agonist use (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.37; 2 studies, 48 participants; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to identify whether IM corticosteroids are more effective in reducing relapse compared to oral corticosteroids among children or adults discharged from an ED or equivalent acute care setting for acute asthma. While we found no statistical differences, patients receiving IM corticosteroids reported fewer adverse events. Additional studies comparing the effectiveness of IM versus oral corticosteroids could provide further evidence clarity. Furthermore, there is a need for studies comparing different IM corticosteroids (e.g. IM dexamethasone versus IM methylprednisone) and different oral corticosteroids (e.g. oral dexamethasone versus oral prednisone), with consideration for dosing and pharmacokinetic properties, to better identify the optimal IM or oral corticosteroid regimens to improve patient outcomes. Other factors, such as patient preference and potential issues with adherence, may dictate practitioner prescribing.

### Systematic literature review of systemic corticosteroid use for asthma management [^77326efe]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Search Strategy and Selection Criteria

A literature search was conducted in MEDLINE and Embase databases via Ovid to identify English-language articles published between January 1, 2007, and December 4, 2017, using the following search terms: asthma AND ([corticosteroid OR corticosteroids OR glucocorticoid OR glucocorticoids OR prednisone OR prednisolone OR dexamethasone OR methylprednisolone OR hydrocortisone] AND [oral OR orally OR systemic OR parenteral OR intravenous OR intramuscular]) OR [SCS OR OCS]). Filters were applied to exclude reviews, letters, and information presented at scientific conferences. Full search details are provided in Table E1 in the online supplement. Searches were initially restricted to English-language articles published since 2007. However, because of the large number of relevant articles identified, and to ensure that the most up-to-date data relevant to current clinical practices were evaluated, the search was subsequently limited to articles published since January 1, 2010.

Abstracts and full-text articles were screened to determine their eligibility for inclusion according to prespecified patient-, intervention-, comparison-, outcome-, and study-design–related selection criteria (Table 1). To summarize, the systematic literature review included observational studies that reported information on frequency of SCS use and treatment patterns, as well as clinical complications and the economic burden associated with SCS use for children (> 5 yr old), adolescents (12–17 yr old), and adults with asthma of any degree of severity. Studies that included < 100 patients with asthma were excluded, as this sample size was considered too small to provide results likely to be representative of the overall asthma population.

Data Analysis

Data from the included articles were extracted into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. At extraction, studies were separated into the following categories of use: oral (OCS), parenteral, and systemic (both oral and parenteral; SCS). The evidence identified was summarized qualitatively, and studies were separated according to whether they reported long- or short-term use.

The efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in the pediatric population are based on the well-established course of effect of corticosteroids, which is similar in pediatric and adult populations. Published studies provide evidence of efficacy and safety in pediatric patients for the treatment of nephrotic syndrome (patients > 2 years of age), and aggressive lymphomas and leukemias (patients > 1 month of age). Other indications for pediatric use of corticosteroids, e.g., severe asthma and wheezing, are based on adequate and well-controlled trials conducted in adults, on the premises that the course of the diseases and their pathophysiology are considered to be substantially similar in both populations.

The adverse effects of corticosteroids in pediatric patients are similar to those in adults (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Like adults, pediatric patients should be carefully observed with frequent measurements of blood pressure, weight, height, intraocular pressure, and clinical evaluation for the presence of infection, psychosocial disturbances, thromboembolism, peptic ulcers, cataracts, and osteoporosis. Pediatric patients who are treated with corticosteroids by any route, including systemically administered corticosteroids, may experience a decrease in their growth velocity. This negative impact of corticosteroids on growth has been observed at low systemic doses and in the absence of laboratory evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression (i.e., cosyntropin stimulation and basal cortisol plasma levels). Growth velocity may therefore be a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in pediatric patients than some commonly used tests of HPA axis function. The linear growth of pediatric patients treated with corticosteroids should be monitored, and the potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against clinical benefits obtained and the availability of treatment alternatives. In order to minimize the potential growth effects of corticosteroids, pediatric patients should be titrated to the lowest effective dose.

Geriatric Use

Clinical studies did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. In particular, the increased risk of diabetes mellitus, fluid retention and hypertension in elderly patients treated with corticosteroids should be considered.

### Steroid variability in pediatric inpatient asthmatics: survey on provider preferences of dexamethasone versus prednisone [^038f273b]. The Journal of Asthma (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective: Our hospital's pediatric Emergency Department (ED) began using dexamethasone for treating asthma exacerbations after ED studies showed non-inferiority of dexamethasone compared to prednisone. However, providers have not reached consensus on optimal inpatient steroid regimen. This study evaluates provider preference for inpatient steroid treatment. Methods: A survey was distributed to providers who care for inpatient pediatric asthmatics. Respondents answered questions about steroid choice and timing. Data were summarized as percentages; bivariate comparisons were analyzed with Pearson's chi-squared test. Results: Ninety-two providers completed the survey (60% response rate). When patients received dexamethasone in the ED, subsequent inpatient management was variable: 44% continued dexamethasone, 14% switched to prednisone, 2% said no additional steroids, and 40% said it depended on the scenario. Hospitalists were more likely to continue dexamethasone than pulmonologists (61% and 15%, respectively; p < .001). Factors that influenced providers to switch to prednisone in the inpatient setting included severity of exacerbation (73%) and asthma history (47%). Fifty-one percent felt uncomfortable using dexamethasone because of "minimal data to support [its] use inpatient". In case-based questions, 28% selected dexamethasone dosing intervals outside the recommended range. Thirteen percent reported experiencing errors in clinical practice. Conclusions: Use of dexamethasone in the ED for asthma exacerbations has led to uncertainty in inpatient steroid prescribing practices. Providers often revert to prednisone, especially in severe asthma exacerbations, possibly due to experience with prednisone and limited research on dexamethasone in the inpatient setting. Further research comparing the effectiveness of dexamethasone to prednisone in inpatient asthmatic children with various severities of illness is needed.

### Adverse events following short-course systemic corticosteroids among children and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^8e9c67d9]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Corticosteroids are immunosuppressant anti-inflammatory drugs that, over the decades, have been widely used to treat a variety of children's illnesses including asthma, croup, and urticaria. From 2012 to 2017, corticosteroid prescriptions in Canada for children between 3 and 19 years totaled 55 000, with a prevalence of 0.9%. Systematic reviews have investigated the harms of short-term use of corticosteroids in children; one studysynthesized safety outcomes of corticosteroids but restricted to specific medical conditions, such as acute respiratory conditions, while another studyrestricted to only oral routes of corticosteroids.

In adults, the treatment of corticosteroid-associated adverse events (AEs) represents a substantial financial burden to patients and health care systems. This burden is expected to be comparable in pediatric populations. To our knowledge, there is no systematic review and meta-analysis available examining the harms of short-course systemic corticosteroids in a pediatric population across different illnesses. AEs are frequently misreported and underrepresented in systematic reviews when compared with effective outcomes. Observational studies are limited by uncertainty of whether apparent AEs are actually symptoms arising from the illness or are related to the drug themselves.

A major limitation of prior individual studies, and even systematic reviews of studies of individual clinical conditions, is relatively small numbers of patients, resulting in imprecision of estimates and low certainty evidence. While effectiveness of corticosteroids is likely to differ across clinical conditions, adverse effects are likely to be very similar. Therefore, we undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to investigate the harms of short-term use of systemic corticosteroids in patients between 1 and younger than 18 years that can be generalized across a variety of pediatric clinical conditions. We limited our population to those older than 1 year because of the rapid physiological and behavioral changes that occur before 1 year but not after that age.

### Corticosteroid choice and clinical outcomes for asthma exacerbations in the primary care setting [^25cdd539]. The Journal of Asthma (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate clinical outcomes in young children with acute asthma exacerbations treated with prednisone/prednisolone versus dexamethasone in the primary care setting.

Methods

Retrospective cohort study of children ages 3-9years with a primary care clinic visit for asthma and an associated oral corticosteroid (OCS) prescription fill in the Colorado All Payers Claim Database between 2/2013–3/2019. This was a secondary analysis of a dataset extracted to analyze risk of future development of asthma in younger children. The primary outcome was subsequent ED visit or hospital admission for asthma within 2-14days after the index clinic visit. Demographics and asthma health services characteristics were assessed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the association between type of OCS prescription filled within 1day of the index clinic visit and the primary outcome.

Results

There were 3236 index clinic visits for asthma for 1918 children during the study period. Sixty-two percent were male and 66% were 3-4years old. Prednisone/prednisolone accounted for 84% of OCS prescriptions fills within 1day of the index clinic visit. One percent visited the ED and 1% required hospital admission within 2-14days. In multivariate analysis, there was no statistical association between type of OCS prescribed and the primary outcome (OR 0.82; 95% CI: 0.37–1.8).

Conclusions

There are no differences in clinical outcomes by type of OCS prescribed for acute asthma exacerbations in the primary care setting. Due to better adherence and side effect profile, primary care providers may consider to use dexamethasone as the preferred OCS.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^34f7b8a8]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Oral corticosteroids in children with severe exacerbations — A dose of oral corticosteroids (OCS) equivalent to prednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day, with a maximum of 20 mg/day for children under 2 years of age and 30 mg/day for children aged 2–5 years, is currently recommended (Evidence A). Several studies have failed to show any benefits when OCS are given earlier during periods of worsening wheeze managed in an outpatient setting, whereas a meta-analysis demonstrated a reduced risk of hospitalization when OCS were administered in the emergency department, but no clear benefit when given in the outpatient setting. A course of 3–5 days is sufficient in most children of this age and can be stopped without tapering, but the child must be reviewed after discharge to confirm recovery. In children discharged from the emergency department, an intramuscular corticosteroid may be an alternative to a course of OCS for preventing relapse, but the risk of long-term adverse effects must be considered and there is insufficient evidence to recommend intramuscular over oral corticosteroids.

### Adverse events following short-course systemic corticosteroids among children and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^40687bf5]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Methods

This systematic review and meta-analysis adhered to the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses reporting guidelineand PRISMA harms checklist. We registered this systematic review in PROSPERO.

Literature Search

With the help of a health science librarian, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases from inception to February 2025 using a combination of keywords and medical subject headings terms related to systemic corticosteroids and AEs (eMethods in Supplement 1). We also searched for additional eligible studies from the reference lists of eligible articles and related systematic reviews. We did not use any language restrictions.

Eligibility Criteria

We included published RCTs evaluating the harms of short-course systemic (oral, sublingual, rectal, intravenous, intramuscular, and subcutaneous) corticosteroids in any condition. Eligible RCTs included noncritically ill children aged 1 to younger than 18 years and reported on AEs during short-course use of systemic corticosteroids — dexamethasone, prednisolone, prednisone, and methylprednisolone plus prednisone and hydrocortisone at any dose — vs placebo or nonsteroidal standard of care. We defined AEs as any unfavorable and unintended signs, symptoms, or syndromes that occur during the period of using an investigational product, regardless of their perceived relationship to the productand short-course as the use of the drug for no more than 14 days at least once daily. Given the inconsistency in the terminology used to refer to AEs in RCTs, we considered all studies that reported on adverse events, adverse drug reactions, side effects, harms, safety, or toxicity of corticosteroids. Serious AEs (SAEs) were defined as events resulting in death, life-threatening conditions, hospitalization, or substantial disability, while AEs leading to discontinuation were events that caused cessation of corticosteroid treatment due to their severity or persistence. We included studies with a population of at least 80% of children within the age criteria. We excluded trials involving inhaled interventions, perioperative corticosteroids for surgical patients, immunosuppressed patients, and patients with HIV or AIDS and cancer.

Study Selection

Using Covidence systematic review software (Veritas Health Innovation), pairs of reviewers (S.R.C. W.T. C.Z. X.C. J.M.S. H.K. and M.R.C.) worked independently and in duplicate to screen titles and abstracts and, subsequently, full texts of the potentially eligible trials. Reviewers resolved disagreements by consensus or, if necessary, by consultation with a third reviewer (J.P.L.).

### Prednisolone versus dexamethasone for croup: a randomized controlled trial [^34417ab0]. Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The use of either prednisolone or low-dose dexamethasone in the treatment of childhood croup lacks a rigorous evidence base despite widespread use. In this study, we compare dexamethasone at 0.6 mg/kg with both low-dose dexamethasone at 0.15 mg/kg and prednisolone at 1 mg/kg.

Methods

Prospective, double-blind, noninferiority randomized controlled trial based in 1 tertiary pediatric emergency department and 1 urban district emergency department in Perth, Western Australia. Inclusions were age > 6 months, maximum weight 20 kg, contactable by telephone, and English-speaking caregivers. Exclusion criteria were known prednisolone or dexamethasone allergy, immunosuppressive disease or treatment, steroid therapy or enrollment in the study within the previous 14 days, and a high clinical suspicion of an alternative diagnosis. A total of 1252 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive dexamethasone (0.6 mg/kg; n = 410), low-dose dexamethasone (0.15 mg/kg; n = 410), or prednisolone (1 mg/kg; n = 411). Primary outcome measures included Westley Croup Score 1-hour after treatment and unscheduled medical re-attendance during the 7 days after treatment.

Results

Mean Westley Croup Score at baseline was 1.4 for dexamethasone, 1.5 for low-dose dexamethasone, and 1.5 for prednisolone. Adjusted difference in scores at 1 hour, compared with dexamethasone, was 0.03 (95% confidence interval -0.09 to 0.15) for low-dose dexamethasone and 0.05 (95% confidence interval -0.07 to 0.17) for prednisolone. Re-attendance rates were 17.8% for dexamethasone, 19.5% for low-dose dexamethasone, and 21.7% for prednisolone (not significant [P = 0.59 and .19]).

Conclusions

Noninferiority was demonstrated for both low-dose dexamethasone and prednisolone. The type of oral steroid seems to have no clinically significant impact on efficacy, both acutely and during the week after treatment.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^a0d096a0]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Box 9–5 — discharge medications after acute care for asthma advises to initiate inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-containing treatment if not already being taken; for adults/adolescents, maintenance-and-reliever therapy with ICS–formoterol (MART) is preferred and, for adults/adolescents, start MART at Step 4 on discharge; if prescribing an ICS regimen with short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) reliever, step the maintenance dose up for 2–4 weeks and emphasize adherence and inhaler technique. To reduce relapse risk, prescribe at least a 5–7 day course of oral corticosteroids (OCS) for adults (prednisolone or equivalent 40–50 mg/day) and 3–5 days for children (1–2 mg/kg/day to a maximum of 40 mg/day) (Evidence A); review progress before ceasing OCS, and if the OCS is dexamethasone, treatment is only for total 1–2 days, with switching to prednisolone considered if there is failure of resolution or relapse of symptoms.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^f3c59447]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

We explored and were able to dismiss subgroup effects, with one exception: the reduction in mean time to complete resolution of pain was greater with intramuscular than with oral corticosteroids. The subgroup effect and its direction was specified a priori, the difference between subgroups was relatively large (about 21 hours), and chance seems an unlikely explanation (P < 0.001). Credibility of the effect, however, is underminedas the effect modification is suggested by comparison between rather than within studies, and we found no similar difference in any other outcome. In addition, the only randomised controlled trial that compared oral and intramuscular treatment with dexamethasone reported no significant difference in any outcome.

The few serious adverse effects in the included trials occurred with similar frequency in the intervention and control groups, although some minor adverse effects reported by patients might not always have been noted. Potential adverse effects that appear later are more likely to occur after repeated use or are rare would not have been captured in the trials. Recent observational studies have raised the possibility of extremely rare but serious adverse effects after short courses of corticosteroids. The quality of this evidence is, for several reasons, low with respect to the current question. The studies used observational designs from large databases with suboptimal verification of diagnoses; serious confounding by indication raises the possibility that the association is a result of the underlying disease process (such as acute inflammation or exacerbation) rather than the corticosteroids themselves; and indirectness in that the doses used in the trials were lower and the duration of treatment was considerably shorter than the duration in the observational studies. Among children, a recent overview of reviews looked at evidence from 44 randomised controlled trials on conditions that required a short course of steroids (such as asthma, bronchiolitis, croup, wheeze, and pharyngitis/tonsillitis) and reported no major adverse events.

### Dexamethasone or prednisolone for asthma exacerbations in children: a cost-effectiveness analysis [^f0ca576a]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Although a short course (ie, 3 to 5 days) of orally administered prednisolone is a common and widely accepted practice among clinicians for administering systemic corticosteroids in pediatric acute asthma, oral dexamethasone for 1 to 2 days is an attractive alternative to prednisolone due to its better palatability and compliance. However, a cost-effectiveness analysis regarding the use of dexamethasone compared to prednisolone is not sufficient, especially in lower- and middle-income countries. The objective of this study was to analyze the cost-effectiveness of prednisolone vs oral dexamethasone for treating pediatric asthma exacerbations.

Methods

Using a decision-analysis model, we analyzed the cost-effectiveness of prednisolone vs oral dexamethasone for treating acute pediatric asthma. Effectiveness parameters were derived from a systematic review of the published literature. Data for costs were acquired from hospital accounts and from an official national database, the national manual of drug prices in Colombia. The study was carried out from a Colombian third-party payer perspective. The principal outcome of the model was the avoidance of hospitalization.

Results

The base-case analysis showed that compared to dexamethasone, administering prednisolone was associated with lower overall treatment costs (US$93.97 vs US$104.91 mean cost per patient) without a significant difference in the probability of hospitalization avoided (.9108 vs .9108).

Conclusions

The present study shows that in Colombia, a middle-income country, compared with oral dexamethasone, the use of prednisolone for treating acute pediatric asthma is cost-effective, yielding a similar probability of hospitalization at lesser overall costs.

### Pharmacokinetics of prednisolone in children: an open-label, randomised, two-treatment cross-over trial investigating the bioequivalence of different prednisolone formulations in children with airway disease [^0ca9ff27]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

One in three Danish children under 3 years of age experience asthma-like symptoms, and one-third will later be diagnosed with asthma. Therapeutic management of acute asthma-like symptoms in infants and children has been repeatedly discussed. Oral glucocorticoids are frequently added to inhaled beta-2-agonist if the patient does not respond to the initial treatment. However, no therapeutic interval exists for glucocorticoids, and no clinical biomarker has been deveopled to asses efficacy.

Furthermore, in Denmark, only intravenous formulations and prednisolone or hydrocortisone tablets are licenced for patients < 18 years of age. Infants and children who are unable or unwilling to swallow a tablet or where dosing is based on body weight are urged to use either an extemporaneous oral liquid formulation, crushed or split tablets. Splitting tablets may lead to dose inaccuracy, and in one study, crushing hydrocortisone tablets lead to therapeutic failure. Extemporaneous formulations are not subject to randomised controlled trials as licenced formulations and bioequivalence (BE) are not determined between different formulations with the same active ingredience. Moreover, the paediatric population is a heterogeneous group of patients ranging from premature neonates to adolescents. The wide physical and developmental differences influence both pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic parameters. These issues are generally poorly studied.

BE studies compare both the rate (the time to Cmax = Tmax) and extent of absorption (area under the concentration time curve (AUC) of various drug formulations. Regulatory guidelines on BE state that two treatments are not different from one another if the 90% CI of the ratio of a log-transformed exposure measure (AUC and/or Cmax) falls within the range of 80%–125%.

To date, one BE study with prednisolone have been performed in healthy adults. Francisco et al examined AUC, Tmax and Cmax of five commercially oral prednisone tablets compared with one reference solution in 18 healthy adults. No statistically significant differences were found between the tablets. Non-significant variations were seen between the solution and tablets except for Tmax, which was 0.53 and 1.2–1.7 hours, respectively. A bioavailability study from Georgitis et al compared liquid prednisone, prednisone tablet and intravenous prednisoloneand found that the AUC for liquid and tablet were significantly different. No studies have been performed in a target patient population, taking into consideration factors such as comorbidities, comedication and physiological factors including first pass metabolism, gastric pH and bacterial flora, which are highly relevant in infants and children.

### Parental preference for short-versus long-course corticosteroid therapy in children with asthma presenting to the pediatric emergency department [^a2cf8c1b]. Clinical Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Asthma is the most common chronic condition affecting children and a prominent chief complaint in pediatric emergency departments (ED). We aimed to determine parental preference between short- and long-term courses of oral corticosteroids for use in children with mild to moderate asthma presenting to our pediatric ED with acute asthma exacerbations. We surveyed parents of asthmatic children who presented to our pediatric ED from August 2011 to April 2012. Questions characterized each patient's asthma severity, assessed parental preference among systemic steroid and inhaled medication delivery options for acute asthma management, and inquired about compliance, medication costs, and intention to follow up. The majority of our parents prefer the use of 1 to 2 days of steroids to 5 days for acute asthma exacerbations in the ED. Thus, dexamethasone is an attractive alternative to prednisone/prednisolone and should be considered in the management of acute asthma exacerbations in the ED.

### Glucocorticoids for croup in children [^5185034e]. JAMA Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Clinical Question

For children with croup, do glucocorticoids reduce clinical symptoms, minimize return visits and/or (re)admissions to the hospital, shorten lengths of stay, or reduce the need for additional treatments?

Bottom Line

Glucocorticoids reduce symptoms of croup at 2 hours and for at least 24 hours, reduce return visits to care, and shorten hospital stays by about 15 hours. Serious adverse events are infrequent.

Oral corticosteroids (OCS) — As a last resort, add-on low-dose OCS (≤ 7.5 mg/day prednisone equivalent) may be considered for some adults with severe asthma (Evidence D), but maintenance OCS is often associated with substantial cumulative side effects (Evidence A). It should only be considered for adults with poor symptom control and/or frequent exacerbations despite good inhaler technique and adherence with Step 5 treatment, and after exclusion of other contributory factors and trial of other add-on treatments including biologics where available and affordable. Patients should be counseled about potential side-effects, and they should be assessed and monitored for risk of adrenal suppression and corticosteroid-induced side effects.

IDSA COVID-19 guidelines — corticosteroids in hospitalized patients and pediatric considerations: Dexamethasone and other corticosteroids are recommended in certain hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (recommendations 7–9), but the studies informing these recommendations either did not include children or did not separately report outcomes for participants under 18 years. Corticosteroid use is nevertheless common in hospitalized children with COVID-19, and there is reason to believe that the risk benefit ratio would be similar in children and adults.

### Efficacy of IV theophylline in children with severe status asthmaticus [^caa861b4]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To determine whether adding IV theophylline to an aggressive regimen of inhaled and IV beta-agonists, inhaled ipratropium, and IV methylprednisolone would enhance the recovery of children with severe status asthmaticus admitted to the pediatric ICU (PICU).

Design

A prospective, randomized, controlled trial. Asthma scoring was performed by investigators not involved in treatment decisions and blinded to group assignment.

Setting

The PICU of an urban, university-affiliated, tertiary-care children's hospital.

Patients

Children with a diagnosis of status asthmaticus who were admitted to the PICU for ≤ 2 h and who were in severe distress, as indicated by a modified Wood-Downes clinical asthma score (CAS) of ≥ 5.

Interventions

All subjects initially received continuous albuterol nebulizations; intermittent, inhaled ipratropium; and IV methylprednisolone. The theophylline group was also administered infusions of IV theophylline to achieve serum concentrations of 12 to 17 microg/mL. A CAS was tabulated twice daily.

Measurements and Results

Forty-seven children (median age, 8.3 years; range, 13 months to 17 years) completed the study. Twenty-three children received theophylline. The baseline CASs of both groups were similar and included three subjects receiving mechanical ventilation in each group. All subjects receiving mechanical ventilation and theophylline were intubated before drug infusion. Among the 41 subjects who were not receiving mechanical ventilation, those receiving theophylline achieved a CAS of ≤ 3 sooner than control subjects (18.6 ± 2.7 h vs 31.1 ± 4.5 h; p < 0.05). Theophylline had no effect on the length of PICU stay or the total incidence of side effects. Subjects receiving theophylline had more emesis (p < 0.05), and control patients had more tremor (p < 0.05).

Conclusions

Theophylline safely hastened the recovery of children in severe status asthmaticus who were also receiving albuterol, ipratropium, and methylprednisolone. The role of theophylline in the management of asthmatic children in impending respiratory failure should be reexamined.

### Evaluating the effectiveness of systemic corticosteroids to mitigate relapse in children assessed and treated for acute asthma: a network meta-analysis [^f008233c]. The Journal of Asthma (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this systematic review was to explore the effectiveness of various systemic corticosteroid (SCS) regimens to mitigate relapse in children with asthma discharged from an acute care setting.

Data Sources

Medline, EMBASE, Global Health, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, EMB ALL, CINAHL, SCOPUS, Proquest Dissertations and Theses Global, and LILACS were searched using controlled vocabulary and key words. Additional citations were searched via clinical trial registries, Google Scholar, bibliographies, a SCOPUS forward search of a sentinel paper, and hand searching conference abstracts.

Study Selection

No limitations based on language, publication status, or year of publication were applied. Two independent reviewers searched to identify randomized controlled trials comparing the effectiveness of SCS regimens to prevent relapse in children following treatment for acute asthma.

Results

Fifteen studies were included. In 3 studies comparing SCS to placebo, asthma relapse was significantly reduced (RR = 0.10; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.77; I² = 0%). A network analysis identified a significant reduction in relapse in children treated with intramuscular corticosteroids (OR = 0.038; 95% CrI: 0.001, 0.397), short-course oral prednisone (OR = 0.054; 95% CrI: 0.002, 0.451), and oral dexamethasone (OR = 0.071; 95% CrI: 0.002, 0.733) compared to placebo.

Conclusion

This review found evidence that SCS reduces relapse in children following treatment for acute asthma, albeit based on a limited number of studies. Additional studies are required to assess the differential effect of SCS doses and treatment duration to prevent relapse in children following discharge for acute asthma.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^39a46c13]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, emergency department setting, systemic corticosteroids, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to continue systemic (oral) corticosteroids for 5–7 days in adult patients (prednisolone or equivalent 40–50 mg/day) and for 3–5 days in pediatric patients (1–2 mg/kg/day to a maximum of 40 mg/day) to reduce the risk of relapse.

### Methylprednisolone sodium succinate (Solu-medrol) [^530865bf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in the pediatric population are based on the well-established course of effect of corticosteroids which is similar in pediatric and adult populations. Published studies provide evidence of efficacy and safety in pediatric patients for the treatment of nephrotic syndrome (> 2 years of age), and aggressive lymphomas and leukemias (> 1 month of age). Other indications for pediatric use of corticosteroids, e.g., severe asthma and wheezing, are based on adequate and well-controlled trials conducted in adults, on the premises that the course of the diseases and their pathophysiology are considered to be substantially similar in both populations.

The adverse effects of corticosteroids in pediatric patients are similar to those in adults (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Like adults, pediatric patients should be carefully observed with frequent measurements of blood pressure, weight, height, intraocular pressure, and clinical evaluation for the presence of infection, psychosocial disturbances, thromboembolism, peptic ulcers, cataracts, and osteoporosis. Pediatric patients who are treated with corticosteroids by any route, including systemically administered corticosteroids, may experience a decrease in their growth velocity. This negative impact of corticosteroids on growth has been observed at low systemic doses and in the absence of laboratory evidence of HPA axis suppression (i.e., cosyntropin stimulation and basal cortisol plasma levels). Growth velocity may therefore be a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in pediatric patients than some commonly used tests of HPA axis function. The linear growth of pediatric patients treated with corticosteroids should be monitored, and the potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against clinical benefits obtained and the availability of treatment alternatives. In order to minimize the potential growth effects of corticosteroids, pediatric patients should be titrated to the lowest effective dose.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may develop after administration of methylprednisolone to prematurely born infants, therefore appropriate diagnostic evaluation and monitoring of cardiac function and structure should be performed.

Geriatric Use

Clinical studies did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

### Adoption of dexamethasone for asthma exacerbations [^7e3d64c4]. Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Previous work has demonstrated that dexamethasone has similar efficacy to prednisolone/prednisone for the management of asthma exacerbations. We sought to evaluate trends in the use of dexamethasone for asthma among children discharged from the emergency department (ED) and to evaluate the association of corticosteroid choice with return visits and hospitalizations.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of 28 hospitals between 2010 and 2024, including children (< 18 years) discharged from the ED with an acute asthma exacerbation who received either dexamethasone or prednisolone/prednisone. We identified trends in corticosteroid selection using breakpoint analysis and evaluated the association of corticosteroid selection with any ED return visit and return visits leading to hospitalization within 7 days.

Results

We included 491576 encounters (median age of 6.2 years [IQR 4.0–9.8]; 62.4% for boys). Of these, 216874 (44.1%) received prednisolone/prednisone and 274702 (55.9%) received dexamethasone. There was an increase in use of dexamethasone (91.1% given prednisolone/prednisone in 2010; 95.3% given dexamethasone by 2024). We identified breakpoints in September 2013 and December 2015. During the 27-month period between these points, adoption of dexamethasone increased by 0.7% per month, (95% CI 0.6–0.9%). Dexamethasone was associated with a higher adjusted odds of return visit (1.07, 95% CI 1.03–1.11) and a lower adjusted odds of hospitalization within 7 days relative to prednisolone/prednisone (0.90, 95% CI 0.84–0.97).

Conclusion

We identified a transition toward dexamethasone use for children with asthma discharged from pediatric EDs. This was particularly pronounced between 2013 and 2015, approximately 15 years after the first dexamethasone trials were published.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^adc1a28e]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma exacerbations in primary or acute care for children 5 years and younger — assess severity while starting SABA and oxygen: "SABA (2–6 puffs every 20 minutes for first hour) and oxygen (to maintain saturation 94–98%)". Recommend escalation and transfer criteria: "Recommend immediate transfer to hospital if there is no response to inhaled SABA within 1–2 hours;… respiratory rate > 40/minute… or if oxygen saturation is < 92% on room air". Systemic corticosteroid options and dosing include: "Consider oral prednisolone/prednisone 1–2 mg/kg/day… up to a maximum of 20 mg/day for children aged 0–2 years, and 30 mg/day for children aged 3–5 years, for up to 5 days; or dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg/day for 2 days". If relapse or non‑resolution occurs with dexamethasone, "consideration should be given to switching to prednisolone". Note measurement caution: "oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry may be overestimated in people with dark skin color".

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^182ae626]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids for acute asthma — timing and doses: OCS should be given promptly, especially if the patient is deteriorating, or had already increased their reliever and maintenance ICS-containing medications before presenting (Evidence B). The recommended dose of prednisolone for adults is 1 mg/kg/day or equivalent up to a maximum of 50 mg/day, and 1–2 mg/kg/day for children 6–11 years.

### Corticosteroid therapy in critically ill pediatric asthmatic patients [^d1a0df1e]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

IV corticosteroids are routinely prescribed to treat critically ill children with asthma. However, no specific dosing recommendations have been made for children admitted to the PICU. We aim to determine current asthma corticosteroid dosing preferences in PICUs within North America.

Design

Cross-sectional, self-administered survey.

Setting

North American PICUs.

Subjects

Pediatric intensivists working in the United States and Canada.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

A total of 104 intensivists completed the survey. Of these, 70% worked in the United States, 67% attended in PICUs with at most 20 beds, and 79% had more than 10 years of PICU experience. The majority of asthmatics were admitted to PICUs based on clinical asthma examination/score or because the patient was receiving continuous albuterol. IV methylprednisolone is prescribed by a large majority of intensivists (96%). Of those who prescribe methylprednisolone, 66% use a starting dose of 4 mg/kg/d, whereas 31% use a starting dose of 2 mg/kg/d, and only 3% use 1 mg/kg/d. The large majority of respondents (85%) use "clinical experience" as their rationale for their preferred dosage. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, only knowledge of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute guidelines was an independent predictor of prescribing an initial corticosteroid dose of 4 mg/kg/d (odds ratio, 3.69 [95% CI, 1.26–10.80]; p = 0.017). Country of practice, years of experience, and PICU size were not associated with corticosteroid dosing preference.

Conclusions

Most intensivists administer methylprednisolone to critically ill asthmatics at doses 2 to 4 times higher than recommended by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute guidelines for hospitalized asthmatic children. The rationale for these decisions is likely multifactorial, but in the absence of evidence-based data, most of them cite clinical experience as their deciding factor. Future research is needed to determine the most appropriate corticosteroid dosage in this critically ill patient population.

### Glucocorticoids for croup in children [^6a5361c0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Glucocorticoids are commonly used for croup in children. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 1999 and previously updated in 2004 and 2011.

Objectives

To examine the effects of glucocorticoids for the treatment of croup in children aged 0 to 18 years.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2018), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, Ovid MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations and Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to 3 April 2018), and Embase (Ovid) (1996 to 3 April 2018, week 14), and the trials registers ClinicalTrials.gov (3 April 2018) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP, 3 April 2018). We scanned the reference lists of relevant systematic reviews and of the included studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated children aged 0 to 18 years with croup and measured the effects of glucocorticoids, alone or in combination, compared to placebo or another pharmacologic treatment. The studies needed to report at least one of our primary or secondary outcomes: change in croup score; return visits, (re)admissions or both; length of stay; patient improvement; use of additional treatments; and adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

One author extracted data from each study and another verified the extraction. We entered the data into Review Manager 5 for meta-analysis. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias for each study using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool and the certainty of the body of evidence for the primary outcomes using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We added five new RCTs with 330 children. This review now includes 43 RCTs with a total of 4565 children. We assessed most (98%) studies as at high or unclear risk of bias. Compared to placebo, glucocorticoids improved symptoms of croup at two hours (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.13 to -0.18; 7 RCTs; 426 children; moderate-certainty evidence), and the effect lasted for at least 24 hours (SMD -0.86, 95% CI -1.40 to -0.31; 8 RCTs; 351 children; low-certainty evidence). Compared to placebo, glucocorticoids reduced the rate of return visits or (re)admissions or both (risk ratio 0.52, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.75; 10 RCTs; 1679 children; moderate-certainty evidence). Glucocorticoid treatment reduced the length of stay in hospital by about 15 hours (mean difference -14.90, 95% CI -23.58 to -6.22; 8 RCTs; 476 children). Serious adverse events were infrequent. Publication bias was not evident. Uncertainty remains with regard to the optimal type, dose, and mode of administration of glucocorticoids for reducing croup symptoms in children.

Authors' Conclusions

Glucocorticoids reduced symptoms of croup at two hours, shortened hospital stays, and reduced the rate of return visits to care. Our conclusions have changed, as the previous version of this review reported that glucocorticoids reduced symptoms of croup within six hours.

### Patient-and parent-initiated oral steroids for asthma exacerbations [^466462f7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways affecting an estimated 334 million people worldwide. During severe exacerbations, patients may need to attend a medical centre or hospital emergency department for treatment with systemic corticosteroids, which can be administered intravenously or orally. Some people with asthma are prescribed oral corticosteroids (OCS) for self-administration (i.e. patient-initiated) or to administer to their child with asthma (i.e. parent-initiated), in the event of an exacerbation. This approach to treatment is becoming increasingly common.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of patient- or parent-initiated oral steroids for adults and children with asthma exacerbations.

Search Methods

We identified trials from Cochrane Airways' Specialised Register (CASR) and also conducted a search of the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (apps.who.int/trialsearch). We searched CASR from its inception to 18 May 2016 and trial registries from their inception to 24 August 2016; we imposed no restriction on language of publication.

Selection Criteria

We looked for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), reported as full-text, those published as abstract only, and unpublished data; we excluded cross-over trials. We looked for studies where adults (aged 18 years or older) or children of school age (aged 5 years or older) with asthma were randomised to receive: (a) any patient-/parent-initiated OCS or (b) placebo, normal care, alternative active treatment, or an identical personalised asthma action plan without the patient- or parent-initiated OCS component.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the search results to identify any studies that met the prespecified inclusion criteria. The prespecified primary outcomes were hospital admissions for asthma, asthma symptoms at follow-up and serious adverse events.

Main Results

Despite comprehensive searches of electronic databases and clinical trial registries, we did not identify any studies meeting the inclusion criteria for this review. Five potentially relevant studies were excluded for two reasons: the intervention did not meet the inclusion criteria for this review (three studies) and studies had a cross-over design (two studies). Two of the excluded studies asked the relevant clinical question. However, these studies were excluded due to their cross-over design, as per the protocol. We contacted the authors of the cross-over trials who were unable to provide data for the first treatment period (i.e. prior to cross-over).

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently no evidence from randomised trials (non-cross-over design) to inform the use of patient- or parent-initiated oral corticosteroids in people with asthma.

### Oral dexamethasone to control wheezing in children at an outpatient clinic [^b3c13278]. Clinical Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Asthma, a chronic childhood disease, has resulted in increased emergency department (ED) visits with high costs. Many asthma ED visits are nonemergent and could be treated in outpatient clinics. Literature has concluded that a 2-day course of oral dexamethasone has comparable outcomes to a 5-day course of prednisone in the ED and hospital setting. A retrospective chart review was performed on children requiring in-house treatment with a corticosteroid (dexamethasone n = 23, prednisone n = 40) for acute asthma exacerbations at an ambulatory medical home. The rates of hospital admissions, ED visits, and symptom follow-up were similar between the 2 groups (P > .05). The cost for a course of dexamethasone was US$1.28 versus US$16.20 for prednisolone. The average cost for an asthma exacerbation office visit was US$79.89 compared with US$3113.28 for an ED visit. A 2-day course of oral dexamethasone appears to be a promising clinical and cost-effective treatment for acute asthma exacerbations at the primary care level.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^24680d4f]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, self-management, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider adding a short course of oral corticosteroids (40–50 mg/day for 5–7 days for adults/adolescents; 0.5 mg/kg/day, maximum 40 mg/day, for 3–5 days for children) for severe exacerbations, such as peak expiratory flow or FEV1 < 60% personal best or predicted, or if not responding to above treatment over 2–3 days. Prefer morning dosing after first dose to minimize insomnia. Advise patients about potential adverse effects. Do not offer tapering if oral corticosteroids are taken for < 2 weeks.

### Novel insights into glucocorticoid replacement therapy for pediatric and adult adrenal insufficiency [^a5cde17f]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, despite being a lifesaving therapy, conventional GRT remains subjected to numerous limitations. Focus should be on side-effect acknowledgment in order to raise awareness among clinicians. An attainment of guidelines for worldwide uniformity is a high priority. In addition, reliable treatment biomarkers are crucial for developing individualized treatment regimens and thus improving compliance. Chronotherapy is a promising field and may be able to mimick physiological cortisol production in the future. Finally, achieving better pharmacokinetic profiles is important for minimizing adverse outcomes of chronic corticoid therapy.

Managing Exacerbations in Children 5 Years and Younger

Early symptoms of exacerbations in young children may include increased symptoms, increased coughing (especially at night), lethargy or reduced exercise tolerance, impaired daily activities including feeding, and a poor response to reliever medication.

Managing Exacerbations at Home

Give a written asthma action plan to parents/caregivers of young children with asthma so they can recognize an impending exacerbation, start treatment, and identify when urgent hospital treatment is required. Initial treatment at home is with inhaled SABA, with review after 1 hour or earlier. If inhaled SABA is needed more often than every 3 hours or for > 24 hours, treatment by a health provider is needed on the same day. Parents/caregivers should seek urgent medical care if the child is acutely distressed, lethargic, fails to respond to initial bronchodilator therapy, or is worsening, especially in children younger than 1 year.

Rationale

Most children with wheezing due to asthma respond to SABA. There is insufficient evidence for parent-initiated OCS in this age group. Preemptive, episodic, parent-initiated high-dose nebulized ICS may reduce exacerbations in children with intermittent virally triggered wheezing, but there are no long-term studies, and there is a high risk of side effects; it should only be considered if the clinician is confident that it will be used appropriately and that the child will be monitored closely for side effects.

Managing Exacerbations in Primary Care or Acute Care Facility

Assess the severity of the exacerbation while initiating treatment with SABA (2–6 puffs every 20 min for first hour) and controlled oxygen to maintain a saturation of 94–98%. Arrange immediate transfer to a hospital if the child shows no response to inhaled SABA within 1–2 hours, is unable to speak or drink, has a respiratory rate > 40/min or is cyanosed, has oxygen saturation < 92% on room air, or cannot be safely cared for at home.

For children attending an ED or admitted to hospital with asthma, consider systemic corticosteroids: oral prednisone/prednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/d for up to 5 days (maximum of 20 mg/d for children 0–2 years and 30 mg/d for children 3–5 yr) or dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg/d for 2 days.

### Methylprednisolone dosing for pediatric critical asthma: a single-center cohort study [^be2fe175]. The Journal of Asthma (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

We aimed to characterize intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone (MP) dosing regimens and clinical outcomes for children hospitalized for critical asthma (CA).

Methods

A single-center, retrospective review was performed of children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for CA between September 2015 and October 2019. Patients 5-to 17-year-olds, initiated on continuous nebulized albuterol, and prescribed at least one dose of IV MP were included. The primary outcome was to characterize PICU MP dosing. Cohorts were then compared by MP dosing: conservative-dose methylprednisolone (CDMP, ≤ 0.5mg/kg/dose every 6h) and standard-dose methylprednisolone (SDMP, > 0.5mg/kg/dose every 6h). Clinical efficacy endpoints were the duration of continuous nebulized albuterol and PICU length of stay (LOS). Safety endpoints included corticosteroid-related adverse events.

Results

Of 168 children studied, 50 (29.8%) were prescribed CDMP and 118 (70.2%) SDMP. The overall mean MP dose was 31.3 ± 19.6mg (weight-adjusted: 0.77 ± 0.32mg/kg/dose). Compared to those prescribed SDMP, those prescribed CDMP had a shorter median duration of continuous nebulized albuterol (12.8 [IQR: 10.5–20] versus 17.3 [IQR: 11.3–29.7] hours, p = 0.019) and median PICU LOS (0.9 [IQR: 0.7–1.4] versus 1.2 [IQR: 0.9–1.8] days, p = 0.012). No corticosteroid-related adverse events were observed. In adjusted models, weight-adjusted IV MP dose was not associated with PICU LOS or duration of continuous nebulized albuterol.

Conclusions

Intravenous MP dosing for pediatric CA varied widely in our study sample. Prospective, controlled trials are required to validate our observations including clinical efficacy and safety endpoints.

### Double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot randomized trial of methylprednisolone infusion in pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome [^a07d389a]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Low-dose methylprednisolone therapy in adults with early acute respiratory distress syndrome reduces systemic inflammation, duration of mechanical ventilation, and ICU length of stay. We report a pilot randomized trial of glucocorticoid treatment in early pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Design

Double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial.

Setting

Le Bonheur Children's Hospital, Memphis, TN.

Patients

Children (0–18 yr) with acute respiratory distress syndrome undergoing mechanical ventilation.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to steroid or placebo groups within 72 hours of intubation. IV methylprednisolone administered as loading dose (2 mg/kg) and continuous infusions (1 mg/kg/d) on days 1–7 and then tapered over days 8–14. Both groups were ventilated according to the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network protocol modified for children. Daily surveillance was performed for adverse effects.

Measurements and Main Results

Thirty-five patients were randomized to the steroid (n = 17, no death) and placebo groups (n = 18, two deaths). No differences occurred in length of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay, hospital stay, or mortality between the two groups. At baseline, higher plateau pressures (p = 0.006) and lower Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction scores (p = 0.04) occurred in the steroid group; other characteristics were similar. Despite higher plateau pressures on days 1 (p = 0.006) and 2 (p = 0.025) due to poorer lung compliance in the steroid group, they had lower PaCO2 values on days 2 (p = 0.009) and 3 (p = 0.014), higher pH values on day 2 (p = 0.018), and higher PaO2/FIO2 ratios on days 8 (p = 0.047) and 9 (p = 0.002) compared with the placebo group. Fewer patients in the steroid group required treatment for postextubation stridor (p = 0.04) or supplemental oxygen at ICU transfer (p = 0.012). Steroid therapy was not associated with detectable adverse effects.

Conclusion

This study demonstrates the feasibility of administering low-dose glucocorticoid therapy and measuring clinically relevant outcomes in pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome. Changes in oxygenation and/or ventilation are consistent with early acute respiratory distress syndrome pathophysiology and results of similar clinical trials in adults. We propose and design a larger randomized trial to define the role of glucocorticoid therapy in pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome.

### Pharmacokinetics of prednisolone in children: an open-label, randomised, two-treatment cross-over trial investigating the bioequivalence of different prednisolone formulations in children with airway disease [^07b4c933]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

One in three Danish children under 3 years of age experience asthma-like symptoms, and one-third will later be diagnosed with asthma. Oral prednisolone is used in various formulations to treat acute asthma. However, the potential differences in bioequivalence between these formulations have never been examined in children despite interchangeable use in clinical practice.

Methods and analysis

An open-label, randomised, two-treatment cross-over trial investigating the bioequivalence of different prednisolone formulations in children with airway disease.

The included patients (6 months–11 years of age) are admitted to the Department of Paediatric and Adolescent Medicine Nordsjællands University Hospital, Hillerød, with asthma or asthma-like symptoms.

The primary objective is to assess the bioequivalence between different prednisolone formulations herein area under the concentration time curve, Cmax and Tmax using saliva samples. The secondary objectives are to evaluate tolerability (five-point face scale), adverse events and severity of the disease. If the patient has an intravenous access for other purposes, the saliva samples will be validated with plasma samples.

A total of 66 evaluable patients are needed according to European Medicines Agency Guideline on bioequivalence.

Ethics and dissemination

Traditional pharmacokinetic trials are burdensome due to the extent of blood samples necessary to capture the time-dependant drug profile. Saliva sampling is far more acceptable for paediatric patients. In addition, this trial adheres to standard dosing strategies. No additional venepunctures are performed, and no additional prednisolone doses are administered.

Guidelines for paediatric bioequivalence trials are warranted.

Trial registration number

The Danish Medicines Agency EudraCT: 2017-003590-33, The Ethics Committee case no: H-17027252, and the Danish Data Protection Agency: BFH-2017–103, I-Suite no.: 05935.

### Inhaled corticosteroids use before hospitalization may Be protective in children with direct lung injury [^42038bec]. CHEST Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

This study has several limitations. First, it was a retrospective, single-center study. Despite biological plausibility, no prior clinical pediatric studies have been published; we wished to determine the potential clinical relevance and to approximate effect sizes of ICS exposure on progression to respiratory failure. Our study was limited to a single-center cohort because we required reliable medication records from before hospitalization and included patients seeking treatment early in the illness trajectory who were not necessarily hospitalized. Hospital admission and ICU databases may be biased toward patients later in the disease course, whereas we specifically hypothesized that ICS exposure would protect against this progression. Although we included only patients with reliable outpatient medication reconciliation, our study remains limited by adherence and not knowing whether patients were taking ICSs at the time of presentation to the ED. Furthermore, in comparing patients with and without ICS exposure before hospitalization, numerous confounders were present. We addressed this by creating a DAG and adjusting for confounders with a multivariable logistic regression model; however, certain confounders, such as medical complexity, were difficult to quantify. We used the number of outpatient medications prescribed as a proxy for medical complexity. Our study also is limited by immortal time bias, although the mortality rate in the cohort was low (< 0.1%) and the subgroup analysis looking at admitted patient encounters was consistent with the results from the entire cohort. Additionally, with a large number of patients demonstrating status asthmaticus and many receiving systemic corticosteroids, we likely have not disentangled fully the associations among ICS exposure before hospitalization, acute use of systemic corticosteroid therapy, and progression to respiratory failure. Excluding patients with status asthmaticus would have decreased our sample size dramatically, rendering the study underpowered to assess any meaningful relationship. Instead, we addressed this by stratifying based on history of asthma and by performing a sensitivity analysis adjusting for receipt of systemic corticosteroids. These analyses provide additional nuance to our findings, but the possibility of residual confounding remains. Furthermore, with the point estimates favoring protection against intubation and NRS in patients both with and without a history of asthma, as well as the relative paucity of side effects of ICSs, our findings support further work investigating the use of ICSs in pediatric DLI.

### Dexamethasone versus prednisone in children hospitalized for acute asthma exacerbations… [^22d9a79e]. publications.aap.org (2021). Medium credibility.

Secondary outcomes included PICU transfers during initial hospitalization and ED revisits and hospital readmissions within 10 days after discharge. Generalized linear models were used to model logged LOS as a function of steroid and demographic and clinical covariates. The analysis was stratified by initial steroid timing. Of the 1410 children included, 981 received only DEX and 429 received only PRED. For children who started oral steroids after hospital arrival, DEX cohort had a significantly shorter adjusted mean hospital LOS (DEX 24. 43 hours versus PRED
29. 38 hours;. 11–18 Several meta-analyses report similar rates of asthma acuity score improvement, hospitalizations, and relapses between the 2 steroid groups after the initial ED visit. 19–22 Studies also reveal better palatability and improved adherence in children receiving DEX compared with PRED. 12, 16–18.

The objective of this study was to compare outcomes between the use of DEX versus PRED in hospitalized children starting oral steroids before versus after hospital arrival for acute asthma exacerbations. Primary outcome measure was mean hospital LOS. Secondary outcome measures were frequency of PICU transfers during the initial hospitalization and frequency of ED revisits and hospital readmissions within 10 days after discharge. Discussion To our knowledge, this is the largest retrospective cohort study to date comparing clinical outcomes between the use of DEX and PRED in children hospitalized with mild-to-moderate acute asthma exacerbations. We found similar mean hospital LOS in children who started DEX or PRED before hospital arrival. However, children who started oral steroids after hospital arrival had significantly shorter mean hospital LOS when given DEX compared with PRED.

For children who started oral steroids before hospital arrival, baseline asthma severity was more severe in the PRED cohort. Baseline asthma severity was similar between the 2 cohorts when oral steroids were initiated after hospital arrival. Acute asthma severity on presentation, as deemed by the initial ED CRS score, was similar for both cohorts irrespective of when oral steroids were initiated. Despite similar baseline and acute asthma severity in children starting oral steroids after hospital arrival, the DEX cohort more frequently required magnesium and ipratropium treatments during hospitalization, whereas the PRED cohort more often required higher supplemental oxygen. Although it is difficult to determine which cohort required more supplemental therapies during hospitalization, the DEX cohort had a significantly shorter hospital LOS even after controlling for these possible confounding variables.

Randomized controlled trials are needed to better differentiate clinical outcomes between the 2 cohorts.

### Adverse events following short-course systemic corticosteroids among children and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^72ac6b30]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Of all trials, 17 (including 2421 participants) investigated dexamethasone, 13 trials (964 participants) investigated methylprednisolone, 12 trials (2313 participants) investigated prednisolone, 2 trials (727 participants) examined prednisone, and 1 study (45 participants) investigated hydrocortisone, dexamethasone, or betamethasone. The median [IQR] duration of corticosteroid treatment was 3 [1–5] days. In 27 trials, (60%), corticosteroid administration was intravenous or intramuscular, and in 18 trials, (40%) corticosteroids were administered orally. While 32 trials, (71%) were conducted in an inpatient setting, 11 studies, (24%) were outpatient only, and 2 studies, (4%) included a mixed population. Table 1 presents the characteristics of all included studies.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^5aac584b]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Global Strategy for Asthma Management — oral corticosteroids (OCS) action plan dosing and triggers: For most patients, the written asthma action plan should provide instructions for when and how to commence OCS, with a short course used for adults at 40–50 mg/day usually for 5–7 days for patients who fail to respond to an increase in reliever and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-containing maintenance medication for 2–3 days, deteriorate rapidly or have a peak expiratory flow (PEF) or forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) < 60% of their personal best or predicted value, or have worsening asthma and a history of sudden severe exacerbations; for children 6–11 years, the recommended dose of prednisone is 1–2 mg/kg/day to a maximum of 40 mg/day, usually for 3–5 days, and patients should be advised about common side-effects and should contact their doctor if they start taking OCS.

### Pharmacokinetics of prednisolone in children: an open-label, randomised, two-treatment cross-over trial investigating the bioequivalence of different prednisolone formulations in children with airway disease [^420e570b]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

One in three Danish children under 3years of age experience asthma-like symptoms, and one-third will later be diagnosed with asthma. Oral prednisolone is used in various formulations to treat acute asthma. However, the potential differences in bioequivalence between these formulations have never been examined in children despite interchangeable use in clinical practice.

Methods and Analysis

An open-label, randomised, two-treatment cross-over trial investigating the bioequivalence of different prednisolone formulations in children with airway disease. The included patients (6 months-11 years of age) are admitted to the Department of Paediatric and Adolescent Medicine Nordsjællands University Hospital, Hillerød, with asthma or asthma-like symptoms. The primary objective is to assess the bioequivalence between different prednisolone formulations herein area under the concentration time curve, Cmax and Tmax using saliva samples. The secondary objectives are to evaluate tolerability (five-point face scale), adverse events and severity of the disease. If the patient has an intravenous access for other purposes, the saliva samples will be validated with plasma samples. A total of 66 evaluable patients are needed according to European Medicines Agency Guideline on bioequivalence.

Ethics and Dissemination

Traditional pharmacokinetic trials are burdensome due to the extent of blood samples necessary to capture the time-dependant drug profile. Saliva sampling is far more acceptable for paediatric patients. In addition, this trial adheres to standard dosing strategies. No additional venepunctures are performed, and no additional prednisolone doses are administered. Guidelines for paediatric bioequivalence trials are warranted.

Trial Registration Number

The Danish Medicines Agency EudraCT: 2017-003590-33, The Ethics Committee case no: H-17027252, and the Danish Data Protection Agency: BFH-2017-103, I-Suite no.: 05935.

Table 1 — Population, Intervention, Control, and Outcomes questions — corticosteroid use in sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is framed by five PICO questions: "Should corticosteroids be administered to hospitalized patients with sepsis?", "If patients with sepsis are administered corticosteroids, should high dose/short duration or low dose/long duration be used?", "Should corticosteroids compared with no corticosteroids be used in patients with ARDS?", "Should methylprednisolone be used over other corticosteroids in patients with ARDS?", and "Should corticosteroids be administered to hospitalized patients with CAP?". Populations are specified as "All adult and pediatric patients with sepsis", "All adult and pediatric patients with ARDS", and "All adult and pediatric patients with CAP", with interventions and comparators including "Corticosteroids", "Placebo or no corticosteroids", and for methylprednisolone the comparators "Dexamethasone, hydrocortisone", with outcomes referenced in supplemental material.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^9c664514]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, primary care setting (oral corticosteroids), GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to administer oral corticosteroids (prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day or equivalent up to a maximum of 50 mg/day, usually for 5–7 days in adult patients, and 1–2 mg/kg/day up to a maximum of 40 mg/day, usually for 3–5 days in pediatric patients aged 6–11 years) for moderate or severe exacerbations, especially if the patient is deteriorating or has not responded to increased reliever and/or maintenance ICS-containing medications before presenting.

### Dupilumab plus medium-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) improves outcomes compared with placebo plus continued high-dose ICS in children with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe type 2 asthma [^4a2b093f]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

ICS remains the mainstay of asthma treatment in pediatric populations, as these medications broadly suppress inflammation through multiple mechanisms. However, when high‐dose ICS is prescribed for > 6 months, some professional societies recommend screening for adrenal suppression as a potential side effect. Whereas recommendations for ICS dosing in children with asthma vary among different guidelines, they generally emphasize the importance of using the lowest effective dose to achieve and maintain control of asthma symptoms and utilizing a stepwise approach with increasing asthma severity.

Nonetheless, there remains ongoing discussion on whether increasing ICS dosage is more effective than using additional treatments in managing uncontrolled asthma. Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of increasing ICS dose in improving respiratory outcomes; however, these improvements may not provide a clinically relevant therapeutic advantage in many children with persistent asthma or may be accompanied by an increased risk of AEs. Although a systematic review and meta‐analysis of 14 studies (n = 5768) showed a small but statistically significant improvement in FEV 1 with moderate‐ versus low‐dose ICS in children with mild‐to‐moderate asthma, there were no significant differences in other efficacy outcomes, and no evidence of a dose–response relationship at low‐to‐moderate doses compared with low doses. Another meta‐analysis (8 studies, n = 3866) found that increasing ICS dose significantly reduced treatment failure but increased the incidence of nonserious AEs.

### Adverse behavioral effects of treatment for acute exacerbation of asthma in children: a comparison of two doses of oral steroids [^72ddcaa9]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the relative adverse symptomatic effects and benefits of therapy with oral corticosteroids at doses of 2 mg/kg vs 1 mg/kg daily in children with acute exacerbations of asthma.

Methods

Using a questionnaire that addressed symptoms, we conducted a prospective study of the adverse effects and benefits of therapy with prednisone or prednisolone at two dose levels in 86 children who were 2 to 16 years of age with mild persistent asthma during an acute exacerbation and were unresponsive to therapy with inhaled steroids and beta-adrenergic agents. Parents and physicians were blinded to the dose level. Children were assigned to either of the two doses by random allocation. Behavioral side effects were assessed via a questionnaire administered by a physician. Benefits were measured by the resolution of asthma symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, and wheeze) at the completion of the treatment with oral steroids.

Results

Behavioral side effects, particularly anxiety (p < 0.02) and aggressive behavior (p < 0.002), were twice as common in patients receiving a dose of 2 mg/kg/d. Benefits were comparable in the two groups. The number needed to harm (ie, the number of patients receiving experimental treatment that would lead to one additional person being harmed vs patients receiving standard treatment) was 6.1 for anxiety, 8.6 for hyperactivity, and 4.8 for aggressive behavior.

Conclusions

Because the adverse side effects were greater at the higher dose but the benefits were comparable, we recommend using an oral corticosteroid dose of 1 mg/kg daily for children with mild persistent asthma who present with an acute exacerbation of asthma.

### Increased versus stable doses of inhaled corticosteroids for exacerbations of chronic asthma in adults and children [^ba7dc490]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

People with asthma may experience exacerbations, or 'attacks', during which their symptoms worsen and additional treatment is required. Written action plans sometimes advocate a short-term increase in the dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) at the first sign of an exacerbation to reduce the severity of the attack and to prevent the need for oral steroids or hospital admission.

Objectives

To compare the clinical effectiveness and safety of increased versus stable doses of ICS as part of a patient-initiated action plan for the home management of exacerbations in children and adults with persistent asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, which is derived from searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and handsearched abstracts to 20 December 2021. We also searched major trial registries for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel and cross-over randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that allocated people with persistent asthma to take a blinded inhaler in the event of an exacerbation which either increased their daily dose of ICS or kept it stable (placebo).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed quality, and extracted data. We reassessed risk of bias for all studies at the result level using the revised risk of bias tool for RCTs (Risk of Bias 2), and employed the GRADE approach to assess our confidence in the synthesised effect estimates. The primary outcome was treatment failure, defined as the need for rescue oral steroids in the randomised population. Secondary outcomes were treatment failure in the subset who initiated the study inhaler (treated population), unscheduled physician visits, unscheduled acute care, emergency department or hospital visits, serious and non-serious adverse events, and duration of exacerbation.

Main Results

This review update added a new study that increased the number of people in the primary analysis from 1520 to 1774, and incorporates the most up-to-date methods to assess the likely impact of bias within the meta-analyses. The updated review now includes nine RCTs (1923 participants; seven parallel and two cross-over) conducted in Europe, North America, and Australasia and published between 1998 and 2018. Five studies evaluated adult populations (n = 1247; ≥ 15 years), and four studies evaluated child or adolescent populations (n = 676; < 15 years). All study participants had mild to moderate asthma. Studies varied in the dose of maintenance ICS, age, fold increase of ICS in the event of an exacerbation, criteria for initiating the study inhaler, and allowed medications. Approximately 50% of randomised participants initiated the study inhaler (range 23% to 100%), and the included studies reported treatment failure in a variety of ways, meaning assumptions were required to permit the combining of data. Participants randomised to increase their ICS dose at the first signs of an exacerbation had similar odds of needing rescue oral corticosteroids to those randomised to a placebo inhaler (odds ratio (OR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.25; 8 studies; 1774 participants; I² = 0%; moderate quality evidence). We could draw no firm conclusions from subgroup analyses conducted to investigate the impact of age, time to treatment initiation, baseline dose, smoking history, and fold increase of ICS on the primary outcome. Results for the same outcome in the subset of participants who initiated the study inhaler were unchanged from the previous version, which provides a different point estimate with very low confidence due to heterogeneity, imprecision, and risk of bias (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.30; 7 studies; 766 participants; I² = 42%; random-effects model). Confidence was reduced due to risk of bias and assumptions that had to be made to include study data in the intention-to-treat and treated-population analyses. Sensitivity analyses that tested the impact of assumptions made for synthesis and to exclude cross-over studies, studies at overall high risk of bias, and those with commercial funding did not change our conclusions. Pooled effects for unscheduled physician visits, unscheduled acute care, emergency department or hospital visits, and duration of exacerbation made it very difficult to determine where the true effect may lie, and confidence was reduced by risk of bias. Point estimates for both serious and non-serious adverse events favoured keeping ICS stable, but imprecision and risk of bias due to missing data and outcome measurement and reporting reduced our confidence in the effects (serious adverse events: OR 1.69, 95% CI 0.77 to 3.71; 2 studies; 394 participants; I² = 0%; non-serious adverse events: OR 2.15, 95% CI 0.68 to 6.73; 2 studies; 142 participants; I² = 0%).

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence from double-blind trials of adults and children with mild to moderate asthma suggests there is unlikely to be an important reduction in the need for oral steroids from increasing a patient's ICS dose at the first sign of an exacerbation. Other clinically important benefits and potential harms of increased doses of ICS compared with keeping the dose stable cannot be ruled out due to wide confidence intervals, risk of bias in the trials, and assumptions that had to be made for synthesis. Included studies conducted between 1998 and 2018 reflect evolving clinical practice and study methods, and the data do not support thorough investigation of effect modifiers such as baseline dose, fold increase, asthma severity and timing. The review does not include recent evidence from pragmatic, unblinded studies showing benefits of larger dose increases in those with poorly controlled asthma. A systematic review is warranted to examine the differences between the blinded and unblinded trials using robust methods for assessing risk of bias to present the most complete view of the evidence for decision makers.

### Dexamethasone versus prednisone for asthma treatment… [^7a6de4e9]. ClinicalTrials (2017). Low credibility.

Study Overview Current corticosteroid regimens for children hospitalized with asthma typically include a 5-day course of prednisone or prednisolone. However, these medications taste poorly and are associated with vomiting and poor compliance. Outpatient evidence suggests that a 2-day course of dexamethasone is as effective as a longer course of prednisone and prednisolone, and better tolerated. Studies in hospitalized patients are lacking. However, prednisone and prednisolone are associated with poor taste and significant vomiting, as well as poor compliance with the treatment course. The lifetime prevalence of asthma in Canadian children has been estimated at 11% to 16% and asthma exacerbations are the leading cause of hospitalization in children. At the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, 215 children were admitted to the inpatient units for asthma in 2015, representing 5. 4% of the yearly medical admissions.

Dexamethasone vs prednisone/prednisolone treatment A recent meta-analysis has shown that 2 days of once daily dexamethasone is a least as effective as 5 days of prednisone for preventing relapse in outpatient pediatric asthma. In addition, patients receiving dexamethasone were significantly less likely to experience vomiting in the ED and even after returning home. Promisingly, a retrospective cohort study in pediatric inpatients hospitalized with asthma has suggested that dexamethasone, when compared to prednisone/prednisolone, may result in a shorter length of hospital stay and reduced costs with no difference in number of transfers to intensive care or readmissions. The degree of adrenal suppression induced by dexamethasone is likely comparable to that observed with intravenous methylprednisolone or moderate to high doses of inhaled corticosteroids. Children in our proposed study will receive a cumulative dexamethasone dose of 1.

2 mg/kg orally, significantly less than used in the aforementioned study. This practice differs from most other pediatric EDs across the country where children typically receive dexamethasone 0. 3 mg/kg on presentation to the ED. As there is significant outpatient evidence showing that dexamethasone is non-inferior to prednisone for outpatient asthma treatment, it is possible that the CHEO ED will have switched over to administering dexamethasone 0. 3 mg/kg to children presenting with acute asthma exacerbation by the time this study is implemented.

### Increased versus stable doses of inhaled corticosteroids for exacerbations of chronic asthma in adults and children [^c2f14e38]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

People with asthma may experience exacerbations or "attacks" during which their symptoms worsen and additional treatment is required. Written action plans may advocate doubling the dose of inhaled steroids in the early stages of an asthma exacerbation to reduce the severity of the attack and to prevent the need for oral steroids or hospital admission.

Objectives

To compare the clinical effectiveness and safety of increased versus stable doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as part of a patient-initiated action plan for home management of exacerbations in children and adults with persistent asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, which is derived from searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) to March 2016. We handsearched respiratory journals and meeting abstracts.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared increased versus stable doses of ICS for home management of asthma exacerbations. We included studies of children or adults with persistent asthma who were receiving daily maintenance ICS.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed quality and extracted data. We contacted authors of RCTs for additional information.

Main Results

This review update added three new studies including 419 participants to the review. In total, we identified eight RCTs, most of which were at low risk of bias, involving 1669 participants with mild to moderate asthma. We included three paediatric (n = 422) and five adult (n = 1247) studies; six were parallel-group trials and two had a cross-over design. All but one study followed participants for six months to one year. Allowed maintenance doses of ICS varied in adult and paediatric studies, as did use of concomitant medications and doses of ICS initiated during exacerbations. Investigators gave participants a study inhaler containing additional ICS or placebo to be started as part of an action plan for treatment of exacerbations. The odds of treatment failure, defined as the need for oral corticosteroids, were not significantly reduced among those randomised to increased ICS compared with those taking their usual stable maintenance dose (odds ratio (OR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 1.18; participants = 1520; studies = 7). When we analysed only people who actually took their study inhaler for an exacerbation, we found much variation between study results but the evidence did not show a significant benefit of increasing ICS dose (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.30; participants = 766; studies = 7). The odds of having an unscheduled physician visit (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.41; participants = 931; studies = 3) or acute visit (Peto OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.98; participants = 450; studies = 3) were not significantly reduced by an increased versus stable dose of ICS, and evidence was insufficient to permit assessment of impact on the duration of exacerbation; our ability to draw conclusions from these outcomes was limited by the number of studies reporting these events and by the number of events included in the analyses. The odds of serious events (OR 1.69, 95% CI 0.77 to 3.71; participants = 394; studies = 2) and non-serious events, such as oral irritation, headaches and changes in appetite (OR 2.15, 95% CI 0.68 to 6.73; participants = 142; studies = 2), were neither increased nor decreased significantly by increased versus stable doses of ICS during an exacerbation. Too few studies are available to allow firm conclusions on the basis of subgroup analyses conducted to investigate the impact of age, time to treatment initiation, doses used, smoking history and the fold increase of ICS on the magnitude of effect; yet, effect size appears similar in children and adults.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence does not support increasing the dose of ICS as part of a self initiated action plan to treat exacerbations in adults and children with mild to moderate asthma. Increased ICS dose is not associated with a statistically significant reduction in the odds of requiring rescue oral corticosteroids for the exacerbation, or of having adverse events, compared with a stable ICS dose. Wide confidence intervals for several outcomes mean we cannot rule out possible benefits of this approach.

### Weighing the risks of treatment versus nontreatment in pediatric asthma [^eb249058]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

During the past dozen years, great strides have been made in the understanding of asthma. In addition, an excellent choice of effective and safe medications has become available for use in both the acute and chronic manifestations of this disease. Unfortunately, asthma continues to affect society adversely in terms of cost and morbidity. Following the NHLBI guidelines for the management of persistent asthma could substantially reduce the health care expenditures associated with asthma and, more importantly could significantly reduce asthma exacerbations, emergent care visits, hospitalizations, and even asthma deaths. All who care for children with asthma must continue to relay the message that asthma is a chronic condition that is best treated with controller agents. Inhaled glucocorticoids are considered first-line agents for all patients with persistent asthma. They have been shown to improve asthma control, improve lung function, and reduce morbidity and mortality. Whether the leukotriene-modifying agents will be shown to reduce morbidity and mortality significantly remains an important and unanswered question at present. Another important question is whether combination therapy and which combination (inhaled glucocorticoid plus LABA or inhaled glucocorticoid plus leukotriene-modifying agent) will provide even further improvement in asthma control and further reductions in hospitalizations and mortality than seen with the use of inhaled glucocorticoids alone.

### Intermittent versus daily inhaled corticosteroids for persistent asthma in children and adults [^258e08ce]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Daily inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the recommended mainstay of treatment in children and adults with persistent asthma. However, often, ICS are used intermittently by patients or recommended by physicians to be used only at the onset of exacerbations.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to compare the efficacy and safety of intermittent versus daily ICS in the management of children and adults with persistent asthma and preschool-aged children suspected of persistent asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials (CAGR) and the ClinicalTrials.gov web site up to October 2012.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared intermittent ICS versus daily ICS in children and adults with persistent asthma. No co-interventions were permitted other than rescue relievers and oral corticosteroids used during exacerbations.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, methodological quality and extracted data. The primary efficacy outcome was the number of patients with one or more exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids and the primary safety outcome was the number of patients with serious adverse health events. Secondary outcomes included exacerbations, lung function tests, asthma control, adverse effects, withdrawal rates and inflammatory markers. Equivalence was assumed if the risk ratio (RR) estimate and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were between 0.9 and 1.1. Quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE.

Main Results

Six trials (including one trial testing two relevant protocols) met the inclusion criteria for a total of seven group comparisons. The four paediatric trials (two involving preschool children and two school-aged children) and two adult parallel-group trials, lasting 12 to 52 weeks, were of high methodological quality. A total of 1211 patients with confirmed, or suspected, persistent asthma contributed to the meta-analyses. There was no statistically significant group difference in the risk of patients experiencing one or more exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids (1204 patients; RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.32; the large confidence interval translates into a risk of exacerbations in the intermittent ICS group varying between 17% and 25%, assuming a 19% risk with daily ICS). Age, severity of airway obstruction, step-up protocol used during exacerbations and trial duration did not significantly influence the primary efficacy outcome. No group difference was observed in the risk of patients with serious adverse health events (1055 patients; RR 0.82; 95% CI 0.33 to 2.03). Compared to the daily ICS group, the intermittent ICS group displayed a smaller improvement in change from baseline peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) by 2.56% (95% CI -4.49% to -0.63%), fewer symptom-free days (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.15 (95% CI -0.28 to -0.03), fewer asthma control days -9% (95% CI -14% to -4%), more use of rescue β2-agonists by 0.12 puffs/day (95% CI 0 to 0.23) and a greater increase from baseline in exhaled nitric oxide of 16.80 parts per billion (95% CI 11.95 to 21.64). There was no significant group difference in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), quality of life, airway hyper-reactivity, adverse effects, hospitalisations, emergency department visits or withdrawals. In paediatric trials, intermittent ICS (budesonide and beclomethasone) were associated with greater growth by 0.41 cm change from baseline (532 children; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.69) compared to daily treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

In children and adults with persistent asthma and in preschool children suspected of persistent asthma, there was low quality evidence that intermittent and daily ICS strategies were similarly effective in the use of rescue oral corticosteroids and the rate of severe adverse health events. The strength of the evidence means that we cannot currently assume equivalence between the two options. Daily ICS was superior to intermittent ICS in several indicators of lung function, airway inflammation, asthma control and reliever use. Both treatments appeared safe, but a modest growth suppression was associated with daily, compared to intermittent, inhaled budesonide and beclomethasone. Clinicians should carefully weigh the potential benefits and harm of each treatment option, taking into account the unknown long-term (> one year) impact of intermittent therapy on lung growth and lung function decline.

The patients' age, severity of airway obstruction, step-up protocol used during exacerbations and trial duration did not significantly influence the primary efficacy outcome. No group difference was observed in the risk of patients with serious adverse health events (1055 patients; RR 0.82; 95% CI 0.33 to 2.03). Compared to the daily ICS group, the intermittent ICS group displayed a smaller improvement in change from baseline peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) by 2.56% (95% CI -4.49% to -0.63%), fewer symptom-free days (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.15 (95% CI -0.28 to -0.03), fewer asthma control days -9% (95% CI -14% to -4%), more use of rescue β(2)-agonists by 0.12 puffs/day (95% CI 0 to 0.23) and a greater increase from baseline in exhaled nitric oxide of 16.80 parts per billion (95% CI 11.95 to 21.64). There was no significant group difference in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)), quality of life, airway hyper-reactivity, adverse effects, hospitalisations, emergency department visits or withdrawals. In paediatric trials, intermittent ICS (budesonide and beclomethasone) were associated with greater growth by 0.41 cm change from baseline (532 children; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.69) compared to daily treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

In children and adults with persistent asthma and in preschool children suspected of persistent asthma, intermittent and daily ICS strategies did not significantly differ in the use of rescue oral corticosteroids and the rate of severe adverse health events, neither did they reach equivalence. Daily ICS was superior to intermittent ICS in several indicators of lung function, airway inflammation, asthma control and reliever use. Both treatments appeared safe, but a modest growth suppression was associated with daily, compared to intermittent, inhaled budesonide and beclomethasone. The clinician should carefully weigh the potential benefits and harm of each treatment option, taking into account the unknown long-term (> one year) impact of intermittent therapy on lung growth and lung function decline.

### Comparison of two continuous nebulized albuterol doses in critically ill children with status asthmaticus [^49841ec7]. The Journal of Asthma (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives: Continuous nebulized albuterol is frequently used to treat children with status asthmaticus in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) but can have cardiovascular side effects. Limited data exist comparing different dosages. The purpose of this study was to compare hemodynamic side effects of two continuous albuterol doses (10 vs. 25mg/h). Our hypothesis was that lower dose albuterol would be associated with lower toxicity without increased need for adjunctive therapies. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all children over 2years old receiving continuous nebulized albuterol for status asthmaticus in our PICU from 2011 to 2013. Standard initial therapy was intravenous steroids and continuous nebulized albuterol. Patients receiving 10mg/h albuterol were compared to those receiving 25mg/h. Clinical outcomes, including the need for additional asthma therapies as well as hypotension requiring fluid resuscitation, were evaluated. Results: About 632 patients were studied (342 received 10mg/h, 290 received 25mg/h). Children in the lower-dose group received less fluid resuscitation without increased adjunctive therapies when adjusted for confounders. Those in the 25mg/h group receiving 17% higher bolus volume. Those receiving lower-dose albuterol had shorter adjusted PICU and hospital lengths of stay. Conclusions: In our PICU cohort of children with status asthmaticus, use of 10mg/h continuous albuterol was associated with lower fluid bolus resuscitation without more adjunctive therapies. These findings support the safety of lower doses in this population. Prospective studies evaluating the efficacy and toxicity of specific continuous albuterol dosages in critically ill children with status asthmaticus are warranted.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The efficacy and safety of prednisolone in the pediatric population are based on the well-established course of effect of corticosteroids, which is similar in pediatric and adult populations. Published studies provide evidence of efficacy and safety in pediatric patients for the treatment of nephrotic syndrome (> 2 years of age), and aggressive lymphomas and leukemias (> 1 month of age). However, some of these conclusions and other indications for pediatric use of corticosteroid, e.g., severe asthma and wheezing, are based on adequate and well-controlled trials conducted in adults, on the premises that the course of the diseases and their pathophysiology are considered to be substantially similar in both populations.

The adverse effects of prednisolone in pediatric patients are similar to those in adults [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Like adults, pediatric patients should be carefully observed with frequent measurements of blood pressure, weight, height, intraocular pressure, and clinical evaluation for the presence of infection, psychosocial disturbances, thromboembolism, peptic ulcers, cataracts, and osteoporosis. Children, who are treated with corticosteroids by any route, including systemically administered corticosteroids, may experience a decrease in their growth velocity. This negative impact of corticosteroids on growth has been observed at low systemic doses and in the absence of laboratory evidence of HPA axis suppression (i.e., cosyntropin stimulation and basal cortisol plasma levels).

Growth velocity may therefore be a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in children than some commonly used tests of HPA axis function. The linear growth of children treated with corticosteroids by any route should be monitored, and the potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against clinical benefits obtained and the availability of other treatment alternatives. In order to minimize the potential growth effects of corticosteroids, children should be titrated to the lowest effective dose.

Health resource use and study medication substitution

*Local doctor review, emergency department review, and hospital admission are not reported as mutually exclusive outcomes.

†Health resource use comprises local doctor, paediatrician, or emergency department review.

Episodes treated with parent initiated prednisolone were less likely than those treated with placebo to result in substitution of the study medication with an oral corticosteroid following a medical review (odds ratio 0.44, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.73; P = 0.002). With regard to episode severity (and thus the appropriateness of the parent's decision to initiate therapy), only 11 (7%) of the 153 placebo treated episodes resolved within three days, whereas 69 (45%) required health resource use (local doctor, paediatrician, or emergency department review). In 54 (78%) of these 69 cases, the study medication was substituted for a known oral corticosteroid. There was no difference in the rate of behavioural adverse effects between treatment groups.

The difference between treatment groups appeared to be unrelated to the number of episodes contributed by participants. Among participants who contributed two or fewer episodes, treatment with prednisolone was associated with an 18% reduction in the daytime symptom score (ratio of geometric means 0.82, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.09) and an odds ratio for health resource use of 0.53 (95% CI 0.25 to 1.10). In participants who contributed more than two episodes, treatment with prednisolone was associated with a 15% reduction in the daytime symptom score (ratio of geometric means 0.85, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.99) and an odds ratio for health resource use of 0.55 (95% CI 0.31 to 1.00).

Introduction

Acute asthma is one of the leading causes of emergency department presentation and hospital admission worldwide. Strategies to reduce the burden of symptoms related to acute asthma and cut health resource use are clearly needed. There is high level evidence that oral corticosteroids are effective in the treatment of acute asthma in children of school age when administered after the child has been assessed by a doctor.

Many of the benefits of oral corticosteroids have been shown to begin within three hours of administration, and delayed dosing is less effective at resolving acute asthma. Incorporating parent initiation of oral corticosteroids into the education and action plans for acute asthma that doctors provide families may be an effective way to ensure oral corticosteroid therapy is initiated promptly when a child suffers an episode of acute asthma. However, a strategy of parent initiated oral corticosteroids is likely to result in higher levels of administration of corticosteroids to children with asthma. This issue is of concern because in addition to their immediate effects on behaviourand adrenal function, oral corticosteroids are linked with reduced adult height in children with asthma. For example, as few as five short courses of oral corticosteroids over a seven year period during childhood has been associated with diminished bone mineral accrual. Therefore, the potential benefits of parent initiated oral corticosteroids require careful evaluation.

Parent initiated treatment with oral corticosteroids seems to be ineffective among preschool children with so called "viral induced wheeze", and the European Respiratory Society recently advised against parent initiated oral corticosteroids in children of preschool age with recurrent wheeze. Existing evidence regarding parent initiated oral corticosteroids in school age children with asthma is inadequate, and the role of parent initiation of oral corticosteroids is not clarified in international asthma management guidelines. None the less, parent initiated oral corticosteroids are widely used in clinical practice.

We undertook a double blind, randomised, crossover trial to determine the effectiveness of parent initiated oral prednisolone compared with placebo in children of primary school age who experience recurrent episodes of acute asthma.

### Dangers of under-treatment and over-treatment with inhaled corticosteroids in children with asthma [^27211cc0]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

We have known for many years that continuous treatment with oral prednisolone produces multiple severe systemic side effects, including growth and adrenal suppression, secondary to high systemic bioavailability in children with asthma. However, most oral corticosteroids are administered intermittently, with 3 to 5‐day bursts, rather than continuously for years. From a systemic bioavailability perspective, it might appear to be better to treat asthma with intermittent 3 to 5‐day bursts of mg quantities of oral prednisolone rather than continuous daily µg quantities of ICS. However, studies have shown that as few as five bursts of prednisone can slow bone mineral accretion in children and such bursts can also affect adults. ICS used in low FDA‐approved doses generally only have enough systemic bioavailability to suppress growth, but not the adrenal gland. In contrast, medium and high doses that the FDA does not approve have sufficient systemic bioavailability to suppress growth and the adrenal axis in children. One study showed that adrenal insufficiency is common and associated with both high‐dose ICS therapy and intermittent treatment courses of oral corticosteroids in patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma.

Patients with mild asthma (as well as people with no asthma at all, like in Case 2) may get a higher degree of lung deposition from ICS, and thus systemic bioavailability and side effects, than those with more severe disease by having very patent lower airways that enable deeper penetration into the lungs. This would predispose children with mild asthma to have more ICS‐induced systemic side effects than those with more severe asthma. Such was the case in a study of nebulized budesonide, in which growth suppression was detected in those with mild disease but not in those with moderate to severe disease. Likewise, in another study, there was a statistically significant correlation between FEV1 just before the inhalation of FP at 8:00and the fall in cortisol production the following morning, suggesting that the degree of airway obstruction affects systemic bioavailability and that FP is likely to induce a more severe decrease in nocturnal cortisol secretion in less obstructed patients.

Recognizing the symptoms and signs of glucocorticoid excess in children and implementing appropriate preventative strategies early in the course of treatment with ICS in children is critical in preventing potentially serious adverse outcomes such as adrenal crisis (Table 4). It is imperative to regularly monitor children for systemic side effects of ICS, including growth by stadiometry and changes in physical appearance at all doses, and 8plasma cortisol level when high ICS doses are used and glucocorticoid excess is suspected.

A third option is the use of a short course of the leukotriene receptor antagonist montelukast. There is evidence that parent initiated montelukast in children of preschool age with intermittent asthma is associated with a reduction in asthma symptoms and health resource use. The magnitude of benefit is similar to that seen with parent initiated oral corticosteroids in this study. The evidence regarding short course montelukast in the treatment of acute asthma in school age children is inadequate, however, and there are no head to head trials comparing short course montelukast with oral corticosteroids for acute asthma in any age group.

What, then, is the role of parent initiated oral corticosteroids in the management of childhood asthma? From a health resource viewpoint, the use of parent initiated oral corticosteroids is cheap and seems to be associated with an important reduction in health resource use, which is costly. From the patient's viewpoint, however, the symptom benefit is modest, and a relatively large number of episodes will have to be treated to prevent the need for a medical review or hospital admission. In addition, the detrimental effects of recurrent short courses of oral corticosteroids may be significant. It seems sensible that if a child of school age has experienced repeated episodes of acute asthma that resulted in health resource use, the parent should be advised to keep oral corticosteroids available to be used in the event of a relatively severe episode. The clinician should, however, regularly review the frequency and appropriateness of parent initiated oral corticosteroids and health resource use to minimise the risk of adverse events related to the oral corticosteroids.

In summary, we found that in children of school age with a history of recurrent acute asthma, a short course of parent initiated oral prednisolone commenced early in the course of an episode of acute asthma is associated with a modest reduction in asthma related symptoms, health resource use, and school absenteeism. Parent initiated prednisolone may be an appropriate strategy for the management of more severe episodes of acute asthma in children of school age. However, the modest benefits of this strategy must be balanced against potential side effects of repeated courses of an oral corticosteroid.

### Ciclesonide versus other inhaled steroids for chronic asthma in children and adults [^9168222d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are an integral part of asthma management, and act as an anti-inflammatory agent in the airways of the lung. These agents confer both significant benefit in terms of symptom management and improvement in lung function, but may also cause harm in terms of local and systemic side-effects. Ciclesonide is a novel steroid that is metabolised to its active component in the lung, making it a potentially useful for reducing local side effects.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and adverse effects of ciclesonide relative to those of other inhaled corticosteroids in the management of chronic asthma.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group register of trials with pre-defined terms. Additional searches of PubMed and Clinicalstudyresults.org were undertaken. The literature searches for this review are current up to June 2007.

Selection Criteria

Randomised parallel or crossover studies were eligible for the review. We included studies comparing ciclesonide with other steroids both at nominally equivalent dose or lower doses of ciclesonide.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information. Adverse effects information was collected from the trials.

Main Results

Twenty one trials involving 7243 participants were included. Equal daily doses of ciclesonide and beclomethasone (BDP) or budesonide (BUD) gave similar results for peak expiratory flow rates (PEF), although forced vital capacity (FVC) was higher with ciclesonide. Data on forced expired volume in one second (FEV1) were inconsistent. Withdrawal data and symptoms were similar between treatments. Compared with the same dose of fluticasone (FP), data on lung function parameters (FEV1, FVC and PEF) did not differ significantly. Paediatric quality of life score favoured ciclesonide. Candidiasis was less frequent with ciclesonide, although other side-effect outcomes did not give significant differences in favour of either treatment. When lower doses of ciclesonide were compared to BDP or BUD, the difference in FEV1 did not reach significance but we cannot exclude a significant effect in favour of BDP/BUD. Other lung function outcomes did not give significant differences between treatments. Paediatric quality of life scores did not differ between treatments. Adverse events occurred with similar frequency between ciclesonide and BDP/BUD. Comparison with FP at half the nominal dose was undertaken in three studies, which indicated that FEV1 was not significantly different, but was not equivalent between the treatments (per protocol: -0.05 L 95% confidence intervals -0.11 to 0.01).

Authors' Conclusions

The results of this review give some support to ciclesonide as an equivalent therapy to other ICS at similar nominal doses. The studies assessed low doses of steroids, in patients whose asthma required treatment with low doses of steroids. At half the dose of FP and BDP/BUD, the effects of ciclesonide were more inconsistent The effect on candidiasis may be of importance to people who find this to be problematic. The role of ciclesonide in the management of asthma requires further study, especially in paediatric patients. Further assessment against FP at a dose ratio of 1:2 is a priority.

New approaches to using approved medications for treatment of mild pediatric asthma — several inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-based strategies are endorsed by the NAEPP guideline and GINA statement, and low-dose ICS is effective in controlling symptoms in children; in the 5- to 44-year age group, ICS reduced hospitalization risk by 31% in those who used at least one canister of ICS during each of the four quarters of the year, there was a progressive decline in mortality risk with increasing ICS use with a decrease of more than 50% with the use of more than six ICS canisters annually, low-dose ICS reduced the risk of a serious exacerbation (admission, emergency treatment, or death) by 41%, and severe exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids were reduced by 0.48 in children and adults with 0 or 1 symptom day per week alongside higher prebronchodilator lung function and more symptom-free days.
