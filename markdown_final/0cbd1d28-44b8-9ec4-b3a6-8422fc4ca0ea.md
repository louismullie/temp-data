## Question

A regional health authority is considering implementing a universal newborn screening program for Turner syndrome. As part of the advisory panel, you are asked to review the proposal. The panel notes that Turner syndrome can present with a wide range of phenotypes, from classic features to very mild or even unnoticeable signs in infancy. The proposed screening test is a chromosomal microarray performed on all newborns. The panel is aware that early diagnosis can be beneficial, but there are concerns about the implications of identifying individuals with mild or uncertain phenotypes, the availability of genetic counseling, and the potential psychological and ethical impacts on families.

Based on current guideline recommendations, what key considerations should you raise regarding the adoption of a universal newborn screening program for Turner syndrome?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the key considerations for adopting a universal newborn screening program for Turner syndrome using chromosomal microarray, including evidence appraisal, test performance, benefits, harms, feasibility, and a practical recommendation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the public health screening framework and whether Turner syndrome meets accepted criteria. Then, I should verify what current guidelines say about newborn screening for Turner syndrome. Next, I will examine the proposed test's technical performance and limitations. After that, I need to weigh potential benefits against harms, including overdiagnosis and counseling burdens. Finally, I should assess feasibility and outline a cautious, evidence-based recommendation with next steps.

> Let me first confirm the screening framework. Universal newborn screening programs are typically justified by Wilson-Jungner principles and modern adaptations that require a significant net benefit, a suitable test with acceptable accuracy, available treatment or prevention, and feasible program implementation; importantly, many national policies still lack rigorous systematic reviews when adding rare conditions, which should temper enthusiasm for expansion without evidence [^068275cb] [^c066057c] [^26bcb1f6].

> Wait, let me verify the current guideline stance on newborn screening for Turner syndrome. The 2017 Pediatric Endocrine Society/American Academy of Pediatrics guideline explicitly states that before considering TS newborn screening, additional studies are needed to evaluate benefits, and optimal molecular diagnostic techniques must be established; it also advises that ethical issues, phenotypic variability, methodological limitations, and the feasibility of appropriate genetic counseling be considered prior to adopting screening platforms that identify TS [^52f6c2f3] [^544a5cba]. The 2024 ESE/PES guideline reiterates the same caution, emphasizing ethical issues, phenotypic variability, methodological limitations, and counseling feasibility before adopting newborn screening programs to identify TS [^a13a0add].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review the proposed test's performance. Chromosomal microarray is a powerful tool, but for Turner syndrome it has limitations in detecting low-level 45, X mosaicism, with most studies showing reliable detection down to about 10% and some down to 5%, meaning a meaningful fraction of mosaic cases could be missed or called equivocal, which complicates screening performance and positive predictive value in a low-prevalence population [^4864b172]. I should double-check confirmatory pathways: guidelines still position karyotyping as the gold standard and recommend that when a rapid result is needed, molecular methods can be first-line with karyotype confirmation second-line, underscoring that microarray alone is insufficient for definitive newborn diagnosis in a screening context [^669cfe39] [^ce10c065].

> Next, I should review potential benefits of early detection. Early identification of TS can enable timely surveillance and treatment for comorbidities such as congenital heart disease, renal anomalies, hearing loss, and growth failure, and it may reduce the diagnostic odyssey; guidelines endorse early echocardiography, renal ultrasound, and hearing screening in diagnosed infants, which supports the clinical value of earlier recognition when it is accurate and actionable [^b3977651] [^6da5ac62] [^15bad31c]. But wait, what if the phenotype is mild or uncertain? The same guidelines emphasize that many individuals with TS have subtle or variable presentations, so early labeling may not clearly change neonatal management in all cases and could expose families to uncertainty without proven benefit [^a13a0add].

> I need to ensure I weigh harms adequately. Overdiagnosis of mild or even asymptomatic 45, X mosaicism is a major concern, with potential psychosocial burdens, insurance implications, and the risk of "vulnerable child" effects; these harms are amplified when screening tests have imperfect positive predictive value in low-prevalence settings, as is expected for TS in newborns [^a13a0add] [^60dfe8fe]. Let me consider counseling capacity: both guidelines stress that appropriate genetic counseling must be feasible before any screening is adopted, and given the complexity of interpreting sex chromosome aneuploidy results, this represents a substantial workforce and systems challenge that most programs are not prepared to meet at scale [^544a5cba] [^a13a0add].

> I should confirm feasibility next. Implementation would require new infrastructure for molecular testing, confirmatory karyotyping, result reporting, and longitudinal follow-up with multidisciplinary care; current newborn screening frameworks vary by state and are already resource constrained, and adding a condition with variable expressivity and uncertain neonatal benefit would strain systems without proven net benefit [^1ef224a4] [^0405a338]. Hold on, I should verify cost and workforce implications: genomic newborn screening pilots consistently highlight that testing is only a small piece; counseling, diagnostics, and longitudinal care drive costs and complexity, and cost-effectiveness has not been demonstrated for TS screening, which is a critical gap for public health adoption [^7950c112].

> Let me reconsider the balance of evidence. The benefits of early TS detection are real but largely extrapolated from diagnosed cohorts rather than demonstrated in a randomized or quasi-experimental screening context; meanwhile, the risks of false positives, overdiagnosis, and counseling burden are nontrivial, and the proposed microarray test has imperfect sensitivity for low-level mosaicism, all of which argue against universal newborn screening at this time [^a13a0add] [^4864b172]. I should double-check that no major guideline endorses universal newborn screening for TS; indeed, both the 2017 and 2024 guidelines frame this as investigational and contingent on stronger evidence and systems readiness [^52f6c2f3] [^a13a0add].

> But wait, what if the region is motivated by prenatal detection rates and wants to extend that logic postnatally? NIPT for sex chromosome aneuploidy, including 45, X, has high analytical performance but low positive predictive value in the general population, and professional societies emphasize non-directive counseling and confirmatory diagnostic testing; translating that experience suggests that newborn screening would face similar PPV limitations and counseling demands without proven neonatal benefit, reinforcing caution [^5fd2ae54] [^4a5d4c6e].

> I will now examine a practical, evidence-aligned path forward. The panel should recommend against universal newborn screening for TS at this time, and instead prioritize three actions: first, invest in prospective studies to quantify net benefit, including health outcomes, psychosocial impacts, and cost-effectiveness; second, strengthen diagnostic and counseling capacity for identified cases, including clear confirmatory algorithms and multidisciplinary care pathways; and third, consider targeted approaches such as enhanced surveillance for infants with suggestive features or known risk factors, while ensuring equitable access to care and counseling resources [^52f6c2f3] [^a13a0add] [^c20e8dc1]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with screening best practices; yes, this mirrors calls for rigorous evidence review and staged implementation before adding rare, variable conditions to universal panels [^068275cb] [^7950c112].

> In summary, I need to ensure the recommendation is precise: universal newborn screening for Turner syndrome using chromosomal microarray should not be adopted now because benefits are unproven at a population level, the test has limitations for detecting low-level mosaicism, and the potential harms from overdiagnosis and counseling burden outweigh uncertain gains; instead, pursue evidence generation, build systems capacity, and use targeted clinical detection strategies until a compelling, feasible, and equitable screening model is demonstrated [^52f6c2f3] [^a13a0add] [^4864b172].

Universal newborn screening for Turner syndrome is **not currently recommended** by major guidelines due to insufficient evidence of net benefit, high false positives, and ethical concerns [^52f6c2f3] [^a13a0add]. Early detection can enable timely management of cardiac, renal, and growth issues, but **no study demonstrates improved long-term outcomes** from newborn screening [^b3977651] [^6da5ac62]. Chromosomal microarray is sensitive but not specific for low-level mosaicism, risking overdiagnosis and parental anxiety without proven benefit [^4864b172]. Programs would require robust counseling, confirmatory testing, and longitudinal care systems that are not yet in place [^544a5cba]. The panel should prioritize research, pilot studies, and stakeholder engagement before any implementation [^52f6c2f3] [^16b59447].

## Clinical rationale for newborn screening

Turner syndrome is characterized by **complete or partial absence of an X chromosome**, leading to a range of clinical manifestations, including:

- **Cardiovascular anomalies**: Congenital heart defects, such as bicuspid aortic valve, coarctation of the aorta, and aortic dilation, are common and may be life-threatening [^a1b75d01].

- **Renal anomalies**: Horseshoe kidney, renal agenesis, and other structural abnormalities are frequent and may predispose to hypertension and urinary tract infections [^6da5ac62].

- **Growth failure**: Short stature is a hallmark feature, often requiring growth hormone therapy [^b430bd2f].

- **Ovarian insufficiency**: Most individuals with TS experience primary ovarian failure, necessitating hormone replacement therapy and fertility counseling [^b430bd2f].

- **Neurocognitive and psychosocial issues**: Learning difficulties, social anxiety, and executive function deficits are common and require early intervention [^a4442ad4].

Early identification through newborn screening could facilitate **timely interventions**, such as cardiac surgery or surveillance, renal monitoring, growth hormone therapy, and genetic counseling. However, the **clinical utility of newborn screening for TS remains unproven**, as no studies have demonstrated improved long-term outcomes from early detection [^notfound].

---

## Accuracy and reliability of chromosomal microarray

Chromosomal microarray (CMA) is a **high-resolution genomic test** capable of detecting copy number variations, including monosomy X. However, its application in newborn screening for TS presents several challenges:

- **Sensitivity and specificity**: While CMA can detect 45, X mosaicism, its sensitivity decreases with low-level mosaicism, potentially leading to false negatives or inconclusive results [^4864b172].

- **False positives**: CMA may detect maternal mosaicism or confined placental mosaicism, leading to false-positive results and unnecessary parental anxiety [^4a5d4c6e].

- **Variants of uncertain significance (VUS)**: CMA may identify chromosomal variants with unclear clinical significance, complicating counseling and management decisions [^notfound].

Given these limitations, **confirmatory testing** (e.g. karyotype analysis) is essential to verify positive results, adding complexity and cost to the screening process [^669cfe39].

---

## Ethical, psychological, and social implications

Universal newborn screening for TS raises **significant ethical, psychological, and social concerns**:

- **Informed consent**: Parents must be adequately informed about the potential benefits, limitations, and harms of screening, including the possibility of false positives, VUS, and incidental findings [^16b59447].

- **Psychological impact**: Early identification of TS may lead to parental anxiety, guilt, and altered parent-child bonding, particularly when the phenotype is mild or uncertain [^60dfe8fe].

- **Stigmatization**: Individuals identified with TS may face social stigma, discrimination, and challenges related to disclosure of genetic information [^notfound].

- **Equity and access**: Ensuring equitable access to genetic counseling, confirmatory testing, and longitudinal care is essential to avoid disparities in care delivery [^26bcb1f6].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

Major professional organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the European Society for Endocrinology (ESE), **do not currently recommend universal newborn screening** for TS. The AAP emphasizes the need for further research to evaluate the benefits, harms, and feasibility of screening, highlighting the following concerns:

- **Insufficient evidence**: Lack of evidence demonstrating improved long-term outcomes from early detection [^notfound].

- **Ethical considerations**: Need to address phenotypic variability, false positives, and counseling requirements [^544a5cba].

- **Feasibility**: Current infrastructure and resources are inadequate to support widespread implementation [^52f6c2f3].

Similarly, the ESE recommends considering ethical issues, phenotypic variability, methodological limitations, and the feasibility of appropriate genetic counseling before adopting newborn screening programs for TS [^a13a0add].

---

## Feasibility and infrastructure requirements

Implementing universal newborn screening for TS would require **significant infrastructure development**, including:

- **Laboratory capacity**: Establishing CMA testing capabilities and quality assurance protocols [^b91ea8e2].

- **Genetic counseling**: Training and deploying genetic counselors to provide pre- and post-test counseling [^notfound].

- **Confirmatory testing**: Developing pathways for karyotype confirmation and follow-up care [^669cfe39].

- **Longitudinal care**: Establishing multidisciplinary clinics for ongoing management and surveillance [^c20e8dc1].

- **Public education**: Conducting public awareness campaigns to educate parents and healthcare providers about TS and screening implications [^notfound].

---

## Potential benefits and harms

| **Potential benefits** | **Potential harms** |
|-|-|
| Early detection of cardiac and renal anomalies enabling timely intervention [^b3977651] [^6da5ac62] | False positives causing parental anxiety and unnecessary testing [^4a5d4c6e] |
| Early initiation of growth hormone therapy improving height outcomes [^notfound] | Overdiagnosis of mild or uncertain phenotypes leading to unnecessary interventions [^abbb282b] |
| Early genetic counseling and family planning [^4f7feb1a] | Psychological distress and stigmatization [^60dfe8fe] |
| Reduced diagnostic odyssey for families [^4f7feb1a] | Increased healthcare costs and resource utilization [^7950c112] |

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Universal newborn screening for Turner syndrome using chromosomal microarray is **not currently recommended** due to insufficient evidence of net benefit, significant ethical and psychological concerns, and lack of adequate infrastructure. The advisory panel should consider the following recommendations:

- **Prioritize research**: Conduct longitudinal studies to evaluate the clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of newborn screening for TS [^52f6c2f3].

- **Develop infrastructure**: Invest in genetic counseling, confirmatory testing, and longitudinal care systems [^7950c112].

- **Engage stakeholders**: Involve parents, healthcare providers, and advocacy groups in decision-making processes [^16b59447].

- **Consider pilot programs**: Implement limited pilot studies to assess feasibility, acceptability, and outcomes [^7950c112].

- **Maintain ethical oversight**: Ensure informed consent, equity, and protection of vulnerable populations [^26bcb1f6].

In summary, while early detection of Turner syndrome may offer theoretical benefits, **current evidence does not support universal newborn screening** at this time. The advisory panel should prioritize research, infrastructure development, and stakeholder engagement before considering implementation.

Turner syndrome — postnatal diagnostic testing approach: At least a 30-metaphase karyotype is specified as the first-line test, and when chromosome analysis is normal but mosaicism is suspected, additional metaphases should be analyzed. Karyotyping is usually performed on peripheral blood, but if the blood karyotype reveals 46, XX and clinical suspicion remains, karyotyping or FISH of a second tissue (eg, skin, buccal epithelium, urine) is indicated; if a rapid postnatal result is needed (eg, newborn), microarray, FISH, or PCR can be used first-line with chromosome analysis as second-line confirmation. In 10%-12% of individuals with TS, a normal or structurally abnormal Y chromosome can be detected, PCR is more sensitive than FISH and should therefore be performed in TS individuals with a 45, X karyotype and signs of virilization, while searching for Y chromosome material in all 45, X individuals is not endorsed.

### Current best practice in the management of Turner syndrome [^b430bd2f]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Turner syndrome (TS) is characterized by partial or complete loss of the second X-chromosome in phenotypic females resulting in a constellation of clinical findings that may include lymphedema, cardiac anomalies, short stature, primary ovarian failure and neurocognitive difficulties. Optimizing health care delivery is important to enable these individuals achieve their full potential. We review the current best practice management recommendations for individuals with TS focusing on the latest consensus opinion in regard to genetic diagnosis, treatment of short stature, estrogen supplementation, addressing psychosocial issues, as well screening for other comorbidities. A multidisciplinary approach and a well-planned transition to adult follow-up care will improve health care delivery significantly for this population.

### Noninvasive prenatal screening (NIPS) for fetal chromosome abnormalities in a general-risk population: an evidence-based clinical guideline of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^5fd2ae54]. Genetics in Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Noninvasive prenatal screening (NIPS) for sex chromosome aneuploidy (SCA) in singleton gestations — ACMG RECOMMENDS THAT NIPS BE OFFERED TO PATIENTS WITH A SINGLETON GESTATION TO SCREEN FOR FETAL SCA (STRONG RECOMMENDATION, BASED ON HIGH CERTAINTY OF EVIDENCE). Screening performance is high with overall detection rate 99.6% (95% CI = 94.8%-100%) and specificity 99.8% (95% CI = 99.76%-99.9%), and positive predictive values (PPVs) of 29.5% (95% CI = 22.7%-37.4%) for 45, X, 54% (95% CI = 40.6%-66.8%) for XXX, 74% (95% CI = 59.5%-84.7%) for XXY, and 74.5% (95% CI = 58.4%-85.8%) for XYY. Counseling notes that the source of information should be based on prospective follow-up of children born following a prenatal diagnosis, that NIPS can identify SCA in the pregnant individual with age-related 45, X mosaicism in 46, XX not associated with Turner syndrome, that this should not be assumed to explain a positive 45, X screen and diagnostic fetal evaluation should be offered, and that suspicion for pre-existing maternal mosaic Turner syndrome should lead to evaluation by a medical geneticist including maternal karyotyping; individuals with confirmed mosaic maternal Turner syndrome should be referred to a maternal-fetal medicine specialist and a cardiologist. Clinical experience indicates laboratories generally provide an opt-out option, and SCA screening is limited or unavailable in twins depending on technology and chorionicity.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 778 — Newborn screening and obstetric care — states that newborn screening is a mandatory state-based public health program that provides all newborns in the United States with testing and necessary follow-up health care for a variety of medical conditions and is the largest genetic screening program in the United States, with approximately 4 million infants screened annually. All states and the District of Columbia have newborn screening programs with varying screening panels, policies, statutes, and regulations, and most programs have adopted the guidelines suggested by the Discretionary Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children. Obstetrician–gynecologists and other obstetric care providers should make resources about newborn screening available to patients during pregnancy, and information can be disseminated through informational brochures and electronic sources and through review or discussion at some time during prenatal care. However, parents or guardians can opt-out of the program for religious reasons following state guidelines. Newborn screening does not replace the potential value of carrier screening nor does carrier screening replace newborn screening, and the document includes updated information on the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP) and recommendations for incorporating newborn screening into obstetric practice.

### Decision-making process for conditions nominated to the recommended uniform screening panel: statement of the US department of health and human services secretary's advisory committee on heritable disorders in newborns and children [^78c5409c]. Genetics in Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

The US Secretary of Health and Human Services provides guidance to state newborn screening programs about which conditions should be included in screening (i.e., the "Recommended Uniform Screening Panel"). This guidance is informed by evidence-based recommendations from the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children. This report describes the Advisory Committee's revised decision-making process for considering conditions nominated to the panel.

Methods

An expert panel meeting was held in April 2012 to revise the decision matrix, which helps to guide the recommendation process. In January 2013, the Advisory Committee voted to adopt the revised decision matrix.

Results

The revised decision matrix clarifies the approach to rating magnitude and certainty of the net benefit of screening to the population of screened newborns for nominated conditions, and now includes the consideration of the capability of state newborn screening programs for population-wide implementation by evaluating the feasibility and readiness of states to adopt screening for nominated conditions.

Conclusion

The revised decision matrix will bring increased quality, transparency, and consistency to the process of modifying the recommended uniform screening panel and will now allow formal evaluation of the challenges that state newborn screening programs face in adopting screening for new conditions.

### Cell-free DNA screening positive for monosomy X: clinical evaluation and management of suspected maternal or fetal Turner syndrome [^4a5d4c6e]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Initially provided as an alternative to evaluation of serum analytes and nuchal translucency for the assessment of pregnancies at high risk of trisomy 21, cell-free DNA screening for fetal aneuploidy, also referred to as noninvasive prenatal screening, can now also screen for fetal sex chromosome anomalies such as monosomy X as early as 9 to 10 weeks of gestation. Early identification of Turner syndrome, a sex chromosome anomaly resulting from the complete or partial absence of the second X chromosome, allows medical interventions such as optimizing obstetrical outcomes, hormone replacement therapy, fertility preservation and support, and improved neurocognitive outcomes. However, cell-free DNA screening for sex chromosome anomalies and monosomy X in particular is associated with high false-positive rates and low positive predictive value. A cell-free DNA result positive for monosomy X may represent fetal Turner syndrome, maternal Turner syndrome, or confined placental mosaicism. A positive screen for monosomy X with discordant results of diagnostic fetal karyotype presents unique interpretation and management challenges because of potential implications for previously unrecognized maternal Turner syndrome. The current international consensus clinical practice guidelines for the care of individuals with Turner syndrome throughout the lifespan do not specifically address management of individuals with a cell-free DNA screen positive for monosomy X. This study aimed to provide context and expert-driven recommendations for maternal and/or fetal evaluation and management when cell-free DNA screening is positive for monosomy X. We highlight unique challenges of cell-free DNA screening that is incidentally positive for monosomy X, present recommendations for determining if the result is a true-positive, and discuss when diagnosis of Turner syndrome is applicable to the fetus vs the mother. Whereas we defer the subsequent management of confirmed Turner syndrome to the clinical practice guidelines, we highlight unique considerations for individuals initially identified through cell-free DNA screening.

Newborn screening programs have enormous public health benefits and have been effective in identifying newborns who can benefit from early treatment. Because of advances in genetics and technology, newborn screening programs are capable of testing for more than 30 disorders, including infections, genetic diseases, and inherited and metabolic disorders. Many important issues surround the debate on universal screening, including financial resources, level of screening, continuity of care, and informed consent. To date, policy on newborn screening has been fragmented; however, efforts are underway to ensure uniformity and equity for all newborns. Obstetrician-gynecologists can continue to work to improve the health of their patients by informing expectant families of the newborn screening process.

Newborn screening is the largest genetic screening program in the United States, with approximately 4 million infants screened annually. Newborn screening is a mandatory state-based public health program that provides all newborns in the United States with testing and necessary follow-up health care for a variety of medical conditions. The goal of this public health program is to decrease morbidity and mortality by screening for disorders in which early intervention will improve neonatal and long-term health outcomes. The program's functions include the initial screening of all newborns, identifying screen-positive newborns, diagnosing conditions, communicating with families, ensuring that affected children are referred to treatment centers, following up with long-term outcomes, and educating physicians and the public according to individual state or jurisdictional guidelines. All states and the District of Columbia have newborn screening programs with varying screening panels, policies, statutes, and regulations. Most programs have adopted the guidelines suggested by the Discretionary Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children. Obstetrician-gynecologists and other obstetric care providers should make resources about newborn screening available to patients during pregnancy. Providing newborn screening information during prenatal care visits can be accomplished in several ways and should be adapted to individual practice style. Integrating education about newborn screening into prenatal care allows parents to be prepared for having their child undergo screening as well as for receiving newborn screening test results.

### Laboratory guideline for Turner syndrome [^c2a917a1]. Genetics in Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Turner syndrome is a disorder that has distinct clinical features and has karyotypic aberrations with loss of critical regions of the X chromosome. Several clinical guidelines on the diagnosis and management of patients with Turner syndrome have been published, but there is relatively little on the laboratory aspects associated with this disorder. This disease-specific laboratory guideline provides laboratory guidance for the diagnosis/study of patients with Turner syndrome and its variants. Because the diagnosis of Turner syndrome involves both a clinical and laboratory component, both sets of guidelines are required for the provision of optimal care for patients with Turner syndrome.

### Implementing genomic newborn screening as an effective public health intervention: sidestepping the hype and criticism [^7950c112]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Use of standard public health disease screening criteria would sidestep most concerns about genomic newborn screening

Most of the concerns that have been raised can be avoided by implementing genomic newborn screening in a manner that meets standard public health guidelines for disease screening. This can be done by (1) limiting the program to a panel of genes for high-penetrance genetic diseases that have been shown to be effectively preventable or treatable in early life, (2) not storing any genomic data beyond the standard newborn screening report in the infant's electronic health record, and (3) assuring the universality of screening, follow-up disease confirmation, and treatment (if indicated) for all "screen positive" infants.

Even if this were done, implementing genome sequencing in every newborn infant would still raise some important health policy issues. One is that a screening test, no matter what it is, is only a small part of a newborn screening program. Once "screen positive" infants are found, the family (or in some programs, the responsible healthcare professional) must be notified and the child recalled for further evaluation, which may require additional testing and specialist assessments that differ for each disease. The infant must then be treated if necessary and followed clinically to determine disease onset or progression, observe for complications and beneficial or adverse effects of treatment, and provide other necessary services such as genetic counseling for the family. It is important to note that the testing, follow-up, and treatment needed for genomic newborn screening would largely be in addition to services that are currently in place for other forms of newborn screening, so universal genome sequencing would constitute a substantial increase in the overall cost of a jurisdiction's newborn screening program, even if the genomic testing itself were inexpensive.

Cost-effectiveness, which is an important consideration for all public health interventions, has not yet been demonstrated for genomic newborn screening for any disease. Implementation of genomic newborn screening before it has been shown to be cost-effective and to meet other standard public health criteria risks damaging the current widespread public and political support for conventional newborn screening, thus harming the babies who benefit from existing universal screening programs. Several large-scale pilot studies of genomic newborn screening are currently underway, and it is important that the results of these studies be obtained and analyzed in a manner that permits accurate assessment of the sensitivity and specificity of genomic newborn screening for serious genetic diseases, the clinical utility of pre-symptomatic diagnosis and intervention, cost-effectiveness, and the overall net benefit to children.

### A framework to start the debate on neonatal screening policies in the EU: an expert opinion document [^26bcb1f6]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2014). Low credibility.

Criteria to evaluate whether a screening program should be performed

There is a clear need to develop and publish agreed case definitions for all disorders screened. There should be an attempt made to achieve agreement on these case definitions within the EU to facilitate assessment and international outcome studies.
The decision whether a screening program should be performed can be based on a framework of screening criteria updated from the traditional Wilson and Jungner criteria (W&J), relating to disease, treatment, test and cost.
The interest of the child should be central in the assessment of pros and cons.
The European NBS body (or the national NBS bodies) should further elaborate the specifications and the operative application of the screening criteria through discussion and agreement with the EU national authorities.
HTA to evaluate the evidence on the effectiveness of early detection through neonatal screening and treatment should be achievable in practice. For rare conditions, best level evidence should be used. Methods need to be developed to both optimize health benefit and careful evaluation.
Universal screening is generally preferable to ethnical targeted screening. If there are sound reasons (eg, health gain) for targeted screening, it is important to avoid stigmatization.
The health system should ensure treatment to all confirmed cases diagnosed by screening. In case of suboptimal availability of treatment, it should plan to make treatment available for all confirmed cases (based on common values and principles in EU Health Systems (universality and access to good quality care)).
Systems should be developed in order to support universal screening in countries where it would be beneficial, but not affordable, for economic and/or social reasons.
Systems should be put in place by the EU for helping the countries, where treatment is not available yet for all confirmed cases. The target of treatment for all confirmed cases should be achieved without reducing the quality of treatment.
The European NBS body (or the national NBS bodies) should consider other potential advantages, especially (a) avoiding a diagnostic odyssey and (b) informed reproductive choice for the next pregnancy(ies) of the parents, and later for the child, and the provision of genetic counseling to the family.
Screening methodology should aim to avoid unintended findings, such as cases with mild forms of the disorder screened for and information on carrier status, as much as possible.
If unintended results are found (such as carrier status), member states need to consider carefully how results are communicated. Parents need to be informed adequately in a way that is consistent with the individual data protection rights and the right to privacy, as well as patient rights. (Pretest information is discussed in Chapter 5 of the Expert Opinion document)(.)
Economic evaluations of NBS programs are needed. Balancing the right to care of all patients' needs to take rare disorders into account.
Even if a program may be cost effective in the long run, the initial costs may represent a barrier to start. Raising specific initial funding should be considered.
Systems should be in place at EU level in order to support the countries, which for reasons of economic development might have difficulties in covering those initial costs.

### Newborn screening programs: should 22q11 deletion syndrome be added? [^60dfe8fe]. Genetics in Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The highly variable 22q11 deletion syndrome has been proposed for addition to newborn screening panels. A literature review investigated the incidence and prevalence, clinical features, and prognosis of 22q11 deletion syndrome and other issues related to newborn screening. Severe complications that could potentially be helped by screening include cardiac defects in 80% (with 20% having no outward signs to aid detection), hypocalcemia that can lead to seizures in 20% (though hypocalcemia is routinely investigated in sick newborns), and severe immune deficiency in < 1% (which would be identified by some states' severe combined immunodeficiency screens). Other benefits that do not fit traditional goals of newborn screening include treatment for complications such as failure to thrive and developmental delay or preventing a "diagnostic odyssey". Although universal screening may prove the incidence to be > 1:5000, undetected life-threatening effects occur in a minority of 22q11 deletion syndrome patients. Concerns include an untested screening technique, difficulty obtaining results in time for cardiac intervention, the chance of "vulnerable child syndrome" in mild cases, and possibly detecting congenital heart disease more efficiently by other means. Because addition of tests for highly variable conditions such as 22q11 deletion syndrome is likely to set a precedent for other syndromes, reevaluation of newborn screening criteria should be considered.

Table 2
Scoring system for assessment of evidence for test accuracy, benefit of early treatment, and overdiagnosis

Test accuracy determines how many people are detected early with true positive test results and how many are potentially harmed by false positive results. The scoring system refers to whether there is an accurate test, which can include any test accuracy metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and positive or negative predictive value. Consideration of the existence of a test is a necessary prerequisite but does not form part of the scoring system. The benefit of early detection leading to early treatment is the primary mechanism through which screening provides benefit. The scoring system refers specifically to the benefit of early treatment, not whether there is an effective treatment, which is also a prerequisite. Overdiagnosis in this context is defined as detection of disease at screening that would never have produced symptoms within someone's lifetime. We were inclusive in the language used to describe overdiagnosis, including asymptomatic phenotypes, penetrance, and any description of people remaining symptom-free to adulthood.

Offer genetic counseling and invasive testing for diagnosis, followed by advanced genetic testing and ultrasound follow-up.

### Committee report: method for evaluating conditions nominated for population-based screening of newborns and children [^c066057c]. Genetics in Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The Secretary's Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children is charged with evaluating conditions nominated for addition to the uniform screening panel and consequently making recommendations to the secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services. This report describes the framework by which the committee approaches its task. Key decision nodes include initial review of every nomination to determine whether conditions are amenable for systematic evidence review, review of systematic evidence reviews conducted by the committee's external review group, and deliberation and formal recommendation for addition or exclusion to the uniform panel. Data analyzed include the accuracy and specificity of screening and diagnostic tests for nominated disorders, the extent of predicted health benefits, harms impact on disease course, and cost from early diagnosis and treatment. The committee process is guided by approaches used by similar entities, but more flexible criteria are sometimes needed to accommodate data limitations stemming from the rarity of many of these conditions. Possible outcomes of committee review range from recommendation to add a nominated condition to the uniform panel; provide feedback on specific gaps in evidence that must be addressed before making a decision; or rejection of a nomination (e.g., because of identified harms). The committee's structured evidence-based assessment of nominated conditions supports a consistently rigorous, iterative and transparent approach to its making recommendations regarding broad population-based screening programs for rare conditions in infants and children.

### Ethical issues associated with prenatal screening using non-invasive prenatal testing for sex chromosome aneuploidy [^b8d161f7]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2023). Medium credibility.

Prenatal screening for sex chromosome aneuploidies (SCAs) is increasingly available through expanded non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT). NIPT for SCAs raises complex ethical issues for clinical providers, prospective parents and future children. This paper discusses the ethical issues that arise around NIPT for SCAs and current guidelines and protocols for management. The first section outlines current practice and the limitations of NIPT for SCAs. It then outlines key guidelines before discussing the ethical issues raised by this use of NIPT. We conclude that while screening for SCAs should be made available for people seeking to use NIPT, its implementation requires careful consideration of what, when and how information is provided to users.

### Changing trends in carrier screening for genetic disease in the United States [^7dc4e7f9]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Screening for genetic disease has been a long established part of preconception and prenatal care. One model for carrier screening has been the community wide screening programs for Tay–Sachs disease (TSD) established in the 1970s. 2 These programs focused on a single severe disease that had an increased carrier frequency in a recognized ethnic group, Eastern European Ashkenazi Jews. Wide implementation of these programs has significantly reduced the incidence of TSD in this ethnic group, with the majority of affected infants currently being from other ethnic groups.

Another disorder that has been widely screened for is cystic fibrosis (CF). It has been over a decade since the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) initiated guidelines for prenatal and preconception carrier screening of cystic fibrosis. Initial guidelines recommended screening Caucasian individuals or those with a family history of cystic fibrosis. In April 2011, the ACOG Committee on Genetics updated their CF screening guidelines, stating that it has become increasingly difficult to classify individuals with CF into distinct ethnic categories. 3 The Committee agreed that it is reasonable to offer CF to all couples planning a pregnancy because it allows them to consider all reproductive options, including pre‐implantation genetic diagnosis, prenatal diagnosis, gamete donation, or adoption.

Given the long history of carrier screening, there are still relatively few guidelines available to providers, resulting in inconsistent practices. In addition, there are conflicting recommendations among organizations (ACOG, ACMG) that have published guidelines. Both organizations recommend screening for cystic fibrosis, Ashkenazi Jewish disorders, and Tay–Sachs disease but ACMG list more disorders on its 'Jewish' panel. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ACOG also recommends ethnicity‐based screening for hemoglobinopathies. 8 Only ACMG recommends screening for spinal muscular atrophy. 9 Neither organization recommends screening for fragile X syndrome, unless the family history suggests it or the patient specifically requests it. 10, 11

Outside of the United States guidelines are more limited. Australia supports universal screening for cystic fibrosis carriers in pregnancy, while guidelines in Canada and United Kingdom do not support this approach. 12, 13, 14 These guidelines are in part driven by cost considerations, and the current availability of cost‐effective gene panels suggests the need to revisit the way screening is offered to patients.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the care of girls and women with Turner syndrome [^829a76bd]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Turner syndrome, more specifically with respect to cardiac imaging, ESE/PES 2024 guidelines recommend to counsel patients with TS, especially with aortic dilation or bicuspid aortic valve, to seek prompt evaluation if they experience acute symptoms consistent with aortic dissection, such as chest, neck, shoulder, back, or flank discomfort, particularly if it is sudden in onset and severe.

### Applying public health screening criteria: how does universal newborn screening compare to universal tumor screening for Lynch syndrome in adults with colorectal cancer? [^c858ea22]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2015). Low credibility.

Institutions have increasingly begun to adopt universal tumor screening (UTS) programs whereby tumors from all newly diagnosed patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) are screened to identify who should be offered germline testing for Lynch syndrome (the most common cause of hereditary CRC). Given limited information about the impact of universal screening programs to detect hereditary disease in adults, we apply criteria used to evaluate public health screening programs and compare and contrast UTS with universal newborn screening (NBS) for the purpose of examining ethical implications and anticipating potential outcomes of UTS. Both UTS and a core set of NBS conditions clearly meet most of the Wilson and Jungner screening criteria. However, many state NBS panels include additional conditions that do not meet several of these criteria, and there is currently insufficient data to confirm that UTS meets some of these criteria. Comparing UTS and NBS with regard to newer screening criteria raises additional issues that require attention for both UTS and NBS. Comparisons also highlight the importance of evaluating the implementation of genomic tests to ensure or improve their effectiveness at reducing morbidity and mortality while minimizing potential harms.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the care of girls and women with Turner syndrome [^c8dc9f29]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Turner syndrome shared decision-making (SDM) — core elements, use contexts, and patient decision aids. Shared decision-making (SDM), considered a core feature of patient-centered care, is a process that recognizes parity between clinicians and patients (or caregivers) as active participants in the decision-making process, and is characterized by three fundamental elements: first, providers acknowledge, and patients (or caregivers) recognize, the need for a decision; second, all parties involved gain an understanding of the best evidence related to the advantages and disadvantages of reasonable treatment options, including those not preferred by the clinician; and third, the values and preferences of patients (and for minors, those of the child's parents) are integrated into the decision-making process. SDM holds particular importance in situations where evidence does not decisively favor one option or when a decision requires careful consideration of individual values, yet evidence that SDM is routinely implemented in pediatric and adult healthcare is difficult to find. Patient decision aids (PtDAs) have been introduced as tools or resources to increase the likelihood of adherence to the principles of SDM, and have been demonstrated to enhance knowledge, accuracy in understanding of risk, reduced decision-related uncertainty, and better alignment of personal values with the chosen course of action.

### A framework to start the debate on neonatal screening policies in the EU: an expert opinion document [^e3531520]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2014). Low credibility.

The European Union (EU) Council Recommendation on rare diseases urged the member states to implement national and EU collaborative actions to improve the health care of rare disease patients. Following this recommendation, the European Commission launched a tender on newborn screening (NBS) to report on current practices of laboratory testing, form a network of experts and provide guidance on how to further implement NBS screening in a responsible way, the latter of which was provided in an Expert Opinion document. After consultation of experts from EU member states, (potential) candidate member states and European Free Trade Association countries, in a consensus meeting in June 2011, 70 expert opinions were finalized. They included the need to develop case definitions for all disorders screened for to facilitate assessment and international outcome studies. Decision whether a screening program should be performed can be based on screening criteria updated from the traditional Wilson and Jungner (1968) criteria, relating to disease, treatment, test and cost. The interest of the child should be central in the assessment of pros and cons. A European NBS body should assess evidence on (new) screening candidate disorders. For rare conditions, best level evidence should be used. The health system should ensure treatment to cases diagnosed by screening, controlled and revised by follow-up outcome studies. Screening methodology should aim to avoid unintended findings, such as mild forms and carrier status information, as much as possible. Activities to improve NBS in Europe, such as training and scientific evaluation, could benefit from collaboration at EU level and beyond.

### Whole-genome sequencing in newborn screening? A statement on the continued importance of targeted approaches in newborn screening programmes [^653ad51e]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

The advent and refinement of sequencing technologies has resulted in a decrease in both the cost and time needed to generate data on the entire sequence of the human genome. This has increased the accessibility of using whole-genome sequencing and whole-exome sequencing approaches for analysis in both the research and clinical contexts. The expectation is that more services based on these and other high-throughput technologies will become available to patients and the wider population. Some authors predict that sequencing will be performed once in a lifetime, namely, shortly after birth. The Public and Professional Policy Committee of the European Society of Human Genetics, the Human Genome Organisation Committee on Ethics, Law and Society, the PHG Foundation and the P3G International Paediatric Platform address herein the important issues and challenges surrounding the potential use of sequencing technologies in publicly funded newborn screening (NBS) programmes. This statement presents the relevant issues and culminates in a set of recommendations to help inform and guide scientists and clinicians, as well as policy makers regarding the necessary considerations for the use of genome sequencing technologies and approaches in NBS programmes. The primary objective of NBS should be the targeted analysis and identification of gene variants conferring a high risk of preventable or treatable conditions, for which treatment has to start in the newborn period or in early childhood.

Recommendations

NGS technologies are powerful tools that allow for novel approaches for studying the genome, including generating the entire nucleotide sequence of an individual. With respect to this capacity to study DNA variants in relation to disease, it can be used at different stages of life, including at birth. The following recommendations are not meant as an encouragement to use new sequencing tools or genome sequencing approaches in NBS programmes, but rather they offer a list of areas that must be carefully addressed should stakeholders consider using said technologies and approaches in NBS programmes. Furthermore, before such tools and approaches are introduced into NBS programmes, the goals and values of these programmes should be explicitly articulated. The responsible use of genome sequencing within a public health programme such as NBS should not be technology driven, but rather be adopted on the basis of its public health potential. The primary justification for performing genome sequencing within the context of NBS should be the health interests of the child. We recommend that the following issues be addressed when considering whether genome sequencing be incorporated into NBS programmes.

Purpose

The primary objective of genome sequencing in NBS should be the identification of gene variants conferring a high risk of preventable or treatable conditions, for which treatment has to start in the newborn period or in early childhood. This includes the selection of variants that clearly cause disease, are known to have high penetrance, and for which effective and accepted preventive therapeutic interventions are available. At this time, we recommend a targeted sequencing or targeted analysis approach.

Evidence

A robust evidence base is a prerequisite for responsible and effective NBS. This evidence base requires the understanding of the presence of variants in certain populations, the sensitivity and specificity of tests, the identification of treatment pathways or preventive action, the calculation of immediate and downstream costs, the assessment of lives saved, quality of life gained and the potential impact on families, and, finally, the determination of public acceptability.

Costs

The infrastructure and human resource costs to ensure monitoring, appropriate education, counseling, interventions and storage must be assessed. Appropriate studies should be undertaken to obtain a realistic picture of all costs involved as part of NBS in a public health programme, including subsequent diagnostic costs as well as the costs of not implementing genome sequencing.

### Association between use of systematic reviews and national policy recommendations on screening newborn babies for rare diseases: systematic review and meta-analysis [^fd943634]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Inclusion criteria

Two reviewers independently assessed each item against the inclusion criteria, with disagreements resolved by consensus. The inclusion criteria were:

Source of documents — only information from national policy making organisations was included. We excluded recommendations by state or regional organisations unless endorsed by a national policy making organisation, and recommendations by clinical societies or other groups unless they were explicitly used to underpin national policy decisions.

Type of document — we included all journal articles, papers, legal documents, presentations, conference abstracts, or reports from the website of the organisation and all those obtained through personal communication with policy makers, officials, and researchers in all included countries. We did not include patient information.

Language — there were no restrictions on language. For documents not in English we used automated translation software, with formal translation by native speakers if further clarity was needed.

Subject of documents — we included material on whether to start or stop screening or material that evaluated the effectiveness of current or proposed screening programmes for any condition using the newborn blood spot test. If we also found reviews of conditions for that country, we included documents describing standards for national evidence review processes for screening.

Method of reaching recommendation — we included recommendations produced using all methods, including evidence from systematic reviews, expert panels, or any approach that resulted in a recommendation or decision or described why or how a decision was made.

Data extraction

Two reviewers independently extracted data, with disagreements resolved by consensus and involvement of a third reviewer if necessary (see appendix 3 for data extraction sheet). Data extraction was carried out in two steps. Firstly, we recorded whether any of the review documentation included a systematic review. The criteria for defining a systematic review were inclusive; we required either two parts of the search strategy (for example, search terms, databases, dates) to be described or any details of systematic evidence selection after a search (for example, inclusion criteria, PRISMA flow chart) to be described (table 1). We were also inclusive about the question posed by the systematic review, which could address any aspect of the evidence relating to whether or not to screen for a condition, including benefits of early detection through screening, disease prevalence, test accuracy, effects of false positive test results, overdiagnosis or any other harm, and clinical course of the condition.

### Diagnostic guidelines for newborns who screen positive in newborn screening [^eae34749]. Genetics in Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Recent expansion of the newborn screening panels has presented an interesting challenge to specialty care centers, especially the clinical genetics community. Some of the conditions in the core and secondary newborn screening panels have extremely variable clinical presentations; others are so rare that only a handful of newborns have been diagnosed with them to date (Region 4 Collaborative MS/MS project-http://region4genetics.org/msms_data_project/data_project_home.aspx). Definition of some disorders is problematic-does continued abnormality of the screening analyte constitute diagnosis or is further testing necessary?

Methods

A work group of the New York Mid-Atlantic Consortium for Genetic and Newborn Screening Services (region 2), one of seven regional collaboratives funded by the Federal Health Resources and Services Administration and administered by the Maternal and Child Health Bureau (U22MC03956), has developed guidelines for the confirmation of diagnosis of the conditions in the newborn screening panels for use by the specialty care centers.

Discussion

The diagnostic guidelines are a work in progress and are being reviewed and revised regularly as our understanding of the newborn screened disorders improves. The aim is to make it a relevant guide for specialty care physicians and other healthcare professionals in the diagnostic workup of these patients.

### Expanded carrier screening for reproductive risk assessment: an evidence-based practice guideline from the National Society of Genetic Counselors [^4f7feb1a]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2023). High credibility.

Expanded carrier screening (ECS) implementation — providers offering ECS should consider what elements of patient satisfaction are most important within their practice to aid in determining which ECS laboratory or product offers an optimal patient care experience; a collaborative approach to ECS, incorporating the unique contributions of both clinicians and laboratory personnel, may minimize potential barriers to ECS including provider time constraints, access to genetic counselors, logistics of sample collection and shipping, issues surrounding partner testing, and costs; an efficient process for offering, ordering, and reporting ECS results must be employed in order to create an achievable and sustainable workflow; providers and/or clinics with financial ties to commercial laboratories and/or ECS products should disclose these relationships to patients; and ECS can shorten or avoid costly diagnostic odysseys for rare heritable disorders and offers patients the opportunity to autonomously contemplate the financial considerations of having offspring with such conditions, while stakeholder input from rare disease and disability communities is essential when considering novel public health initiatives.

### Good laboratory practices for biochemical genetic testing and newborn screening for inherited metabolic disorders [^feb2a536]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Workgroup charge and process for biochemical genetic testing and newborn screening are described: The workgroup was charged with providing input to CLIAC for developing recommendations for good laboratory practices for biochemical genetic testing, with specific tasks including suggesting the scope of CLIAC considerations, recognizing and identifying issues needing quality assurance guidance, identifying additional data sources, reviewing relevant practice guidelines and standards, suggesting strategies where standards are lacking or inconsistent, and formulating workgroup input for CLIAC consideration, and issues without consensus were to be reported to CLIAC; through meetings and teleconferences in 2009 the workgroup considered the scope of recommendations and suggested that recommendations apply to biochemical genetic testing as well as to newborn screening for inborn errors of metabolism; the workgroup reviewed compendium documents of laboratory standards and guidelines and information on HHS-approved and other certification boards; the workgroup report was presented to CLIAC at the February 2010 CLIAC meeting, and CLIAC recommendations were formed by reviewing the report and making modifications and additional recommendations.

### Association between use of systematic reviews and national policy recommendations on screening newborn babies for rare diseases: systematic review and meta-analysis [^068275cb]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Policy implications

This study showed that many national policy decisions about whether to screen for conditions using the newborn blood spot test are being made without systematically reviewing the evidence. One reason for this absence is likely to lay in the absence of evidence from randomised controlled trials, which is unavailable for most conditions included in the newborn blood spot owing to their rarity. Indeed, although many countries have developed robust systems for reviewing new screening programmes, we found that they are often not applied when assessing whether to screen for additional rare diseases using the newborn blood spot test. Yet it remains essential to make evidence based policy decisions because once screening programmes are started they are difficult to stop. When trial evidence is not available, a review of whether to screen for each condition should consider the evidence for each pathway to patient benefit and harm resulting from introducing a screening test, in particular: the test's ability to discern true disease, any resulting potential for patient harm from overdiagnosis, and the benefits of early detection. Although many reviews considered whether subsequent diagnostic tests and treatments were available to manage screened patients, most did not consider evidence for the screening test's accuracy, nor whether earlier detection and treatment after screening were beneficial to patients compared with later detection of symptoms and treatment. These three elements are not an exhaustive list of benefits and harms (for example, we did not examine the effect of screening results to other family members); however, there is broad agreement that they are key indicators of effectiveness. We recommend that whenever possible a systematic review of the literature should be undertaken as part of policy decisions on whether to commence screening. Full systematic reviews that assess each key element of a screening programme can be expensive and time consuming — particularly in the absence of trial evidence, and we propose more international collaboration to undertake such reviews. Although the health systems, prevalence, culture, and willingness to pay thresholds might differ by country, the evidence about test accuracy, benefits of early detection, and overdiagnosis are international bodies of evidence, and collating them will be the same regardless of country. Only concerns about applicability will differ.

Conclusions

Further research is required to understand why policy makers do not employ systematic review methods in their evaluations of evidence. Possible reasons include costs, time, and knowledge and beliefs about systematic reviews. Undertaking international reviews for conditions across several countries would reduce overall costs. These reviews could be adapted to local populations and prevalence and improve rigour while reducing discrepancies in screening internationally.

### Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine (SMFM) clinical guideline # 7: nonimmune hydrops fetalis [^dcdcf132]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Medium credibility.

SMFM clinical guideline — chromosomal etiologies of nonimmune hydrops fetalis (NIHF) and diagnostic testing: Chromosomal abnormalities, particularly Turner syndrome (45, X) and Down syndrome (trisomy 21) are also common causes of NIHF, accounting for 13% in a large systematic review. Turner syndrome is associated with 50–80% of cases of cystic hygromas. Some such cases occur due to a transient abnormal myelopoiesis, a leukemic condition that occurs in about 10% of infants with Down syndrome. For these reasons, we recommend that NIHF is an indication for prenatal diagnosis with karyotype, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and/or chromosomal microarray analysis, even when severe anemia is present. Screening with noninvasive prenatal testing may detect some chromosomal causes but provides more limited information about possible genetic etiologies, and therefore we recommend diagnostic testing.

4 DISCUSSION

The SCAN study is the first sex‐specific newborn screening implemented in a real‐life setting. Here, we present the results of this 1‐year pilot carried out in four Dutch provinces. The recommendation made by the Health Council of the Netherlands to only screen males for ALD and not identify other conditions associated with elevated C26:0‐LPC concentrations posed a challenge. Prior to the start of the pilot, we developed and validated the X‐counter. The X‐counter enables the selection of dried bloodspots derived from male newborns, but also from newborns with Turner syndrome (45, X), for further analysis of C26:0‐LPC by HPLC–MS/MS. Importantly, the identification of a girl with both Turner syndrome and ALD is warranted, because of the same risk of developing adrenal insufficiency and/or cerebral ALD as a boy with ALD. On the other hand, the X‐counter will prevent screening for ALD of a boy with Klinefelter syndrome (47XXY), who will have the same very low risk of developing adrenal insufficiency and/or cerebral ALD as a girl with ALD. Therefore, ALD screening based on the number of X‐chromosomes is in line with the recommendation of the Dutch Health Council to only identify newborns at risk of developing adrenal insufficiency and/or cerebral ALD.

To ensure a high enough number of dried blood spots to test the screening algorithm, parents of boys and girls were asked to participate in the SCAN study. Of the 72 379 newborns that were eligible for ALD screening, parents of 1171 (1.62%) children declined participation. Parents of a girl declined participation twice as often (2.19%) as parents of a boy (1.08%). A likely explanation could be that screening for ALD is sex‐specific and therefore parents of a girl may have decided that there is no advantage in participating in the SCAN study. Overall, participation in the SCAN study was 98.4% for all eligible newborns and 98.9% for boys, which is very close to the overall newborn screening participation rate (99.3% in 2020) in the Netherlands.

### Cystic fibrosis newborn screening: a systematic review-driven consensus guideline from the United States Cystic Fibrosis Foundation [^6d9917a4]. International Journal of Neonatal Screening (2025). High credibility.

Cystic fibrosis newborn screening — Newborn screening for cystic fibrosis (CF) has been universal in the US since 2010, and systematic reviews were used to develop seven recommendations to improve timeliness, sensitivity, and equity in diagnosing infants with CF. The CF Foundation recommends the use of a floating immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) cutoff over a fixed IRT cutoff. The CF Foundation recommends using a very high IRT referral strategy in CF newborn screening programs whose variant panel does not include all CF-causing variants in CFTR2 or does not have a variant panel that achieves at least 95% sensitivity in all ancestral groups within the state. The CF Foundation recommends that CF newborn screening algorithms should not limit CFTR variant detection to the 508del variant or variants included in the American College of Medical Genetics-23 panel. The CF Foundation recommends that CF newborn screening programs screen for all CF-causing CFTR variants in CFTR2.

### Good laboratory practices for biochemical genetic testing and newborn screening for inherited metabolic disorders [^b91ea8e2]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Initial information review and assessment (2008–2009) — conduct and scope: An initial information review and assessment was conducted by CDC scientists from the Division of Laboratory Science and Standards in collaboration with the CDC Newborn Screening Quality Assurance Program to identify laboratory practice issues, define issues for consideration by a CLIAC workgroup and needed expertise, assess information needed to facilitate the workgroup's evaluation of current standards, guidelines, and practices, and gauge the usefulness and impact of the CDC recommendations on laboratory testing quality and public health. The information review and assessment consisted of a literature review, gathering data from existing databases and resources, and a review of regulatory and voluntary standards applicable to biochemical genetic testing and newborn screening, including regulatory and professional standards such as the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) Standards and Guidelines for Clinical Genetic Laboratories, Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines, CLIA regulations, FDA guidance documents, state requirements, accreditation checklists, national practice guidelines, and international standards and guidelines. A search of biochemical literature published since 2006 was conducted using the Medline and the PubMed databases, and CDC scientists included these standards in comprehensive comparison documents for each laboratory practice area in which quality assurance concerns or the need for specific quality assurance guidance were identified.
