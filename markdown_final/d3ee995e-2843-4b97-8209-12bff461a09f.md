## Question

can you band external hemorrhoids

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether external hemorrhoids can be treated with rubber band ligation and, if not, what the appropriate alternatives are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the anatomic distinction between internal and external hemorrhoids and why that matters for innervation and pain. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about indications for rubber band ligation and whether they include external disease. Next, I will examine the pathophysiologic rationale that makes banding feasible for internal but not external hemorrhoids. After that, I should review the recommended treatments for external hemorrhoids, including thrombosed cases, and confirm timing. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically actionable answer with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the anatomic foundation because everything hinges on it. Internal hemorrhoids originate above the dentate line and are covered by insensate transitional columnar mucosa, whereas external hemorrhoids arise below the dentate line and are covered by somatically innervated anoderm, which is pain-sensitive; this innervation difference is the key reason banding is appropriate for internal but not external disease [^112nkkP9] [^112MKBGH] [^114Mgb8g].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline stance before drawing conclusions. The ASCRS 2024 guideline explicitly recommends rubber band ligation as the most effective office-based treatment for symptomatic grade I–II internal hemorrhoids and selected grade III internal hemorrhoids, and it does not extend banding indications to external hemorrhoids. Instead, it advises excisional hemorrhoidectomy for symptomatic external hemorrhoids or combined internal–external disease, underscoring that banding is not a treatment for isolated external hemorrhoids [^115gsWnS] [^113TGPCi] [^114sJ4Wd]. I should also confirm that ACG guidance aligns with this, and indeed ACG positions banding as a first-line office procedure for internal hemorrhoids after failed medical therapy, again not for external disease [^112Utnpi] [^114NSXhP].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check the pathophysiologic rationale to ensure this isn't just tradition. Rubber band ligation works by placing the band above the dentate line on the internal hemorrhoid pedicle, inducing ischemia, necrosis, and fibrosis that fix the cushion and correct prolapse; this mechanism requires targeting tissue above the dentate line in a relatively pain-insensitive zone, which external hemorrhoids do not provide, and banding external tissue would cause severe somatic pain and poor tolerance [^114Mgb8g] [^117RPTR4]. I should double-check that expert endoscopic guidance also warns against bands near or below the dentate line due to pain, which it does, reinforcing the anatomical constraint [^115wUsDW].

> Next, I should review what to do for external hemorrhoids, especially if thrombosed. For acutely thrombosed external hemorrhoids within about 72 hours of onset, early surgical excision or evacuation of the thrombus provides rapid pain relief and reduces recurrence risk; after 72 hours, conservative management is reasonable as the thrombus organizes and pain often improves, though excision can still be considered for persistent symptoms or patient preference [^112MKBGH] [^116N2x7f] [^112A2DgF]. Let me verify that guidelines also caution against simple incision and drainage without excision of the hemorrhoid, which WSES-AAST notes due to higher recurrence and incomplete treatment, supporting complete excision when intervention is pursued early [^116rKskB] [^116UkJZh].

> I will now examine non-thrombosed external hemorrhoids to ensure I'm not missing a role for banding. For chronic external hemorrhoidal symptoms such as hygiene difficulties, irritation, or skin tags, excisional hemorrhoidectomy is the appropriate procedural therapy when conservative measures fail; banding is not indicated because it cannot address the somatically innervated external tissue and would be expected to cause unacceptable pain without therapeutic benefit [^114sJ4Wd] [^114Mgb8g]. But wait, what if there is mixed disease with both internal and external components? In that scenario, guidelines support addressing the internal component with banding if indicated, while the external component generally requires excision for definitive management, reinforcing that banding does not substitute for external hemorrhoid treatment [^114sJ4Wd] [^115gsWnS].

> Let me reconsider whether any exceptions or edge cases allow banding of external tissue. Some retrospective series describe multiple or even "external" banding in special populations, but these are nonstandard practices, often reflect misclassification, and are not endorsed by contemporary guidelines; importantly, they carry higher pain and complication risks and should not be generalized to routine care [^1164cdkR] [^115gsWnS]. I should confirm that authoritative reviews explicitly state banding cannot be performed on external hemorrhoids due to somatic innervation, which they do, closing the loop on exceptions [^114Mgb8g].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise. No, external hemorrhoids cannot be treated with rubber band ligation because they lie below the dentate line in a somatically innervated, pain-sensitive zone and lack the anatomic substrate that makes banding effective and tolerable; instead, manage with conservative measures and, when indicated, excisional hemorrhoidectomy, with early excision for thrombosed external hemorrhoids within 72 hours to optimize pain control and outcomes [^114Mgb8g] [^114sJ4Wd] [^112MKBGH] [^112A2DgF].

---

Rubber band ligation is **not appropriate for external hemorrhoids** because they are below the dentate line and have somatic innervation, making banding extremely painful and ineffective [^114Mgb8g]. The standard of care for external hemorrhoids is **conservative management** (fiber, fluids, sitz baths, topical agents) and, if thrombosed, **early excision within 72 hours** for best pain relief and outcomes [^111wfR2E] [^116N2x7f]. Banding is reserved for internal hemorrhoids and should not be used for external disease.

---

## Anatomical and physiological considerations

External hemorrhoids are located **below the dentate line**, where somatic sensory nerves provide pain sensation; by contrast, internal hemorrhoids are above the dentate line and are innervated by visceral afferents, which are less sensitive to pain [^112MKBGH]. Banding external tissue would cause **significant pain and discomfort** because of this somatic innervation [^115wUsDW].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines from the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS) and the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) **do not recommend rubber band ligation for external hemorrhoids**. RBL is indicated for internal hemorrhoids (grades I–III) and is not appropriate for external hemorrhoids because of their location and innervation [^113As8NL] [^114NSXhP] [^114sJ4Wd] [^114Mgb8g].

---

## Potential risks and complications

Attempting rubber band ligation on external hemorrhoids can lead to **significant complications**, including:

- **Severe pain**: Due to somatic innervation below the dentate line [^115wUsDW].
- **Infection**: Risk of localized infection and abscess formation.
- **Tissue necrosis**: Inappropriate banding can cause tissue damage and necrosis.
- **Delayed healing**: External hemorrhoids lack the mucosal environment conducive to rapid healing after banding.

---

## Alternative treatments for external hemorrhoids

The **recommended treatments** for external hemorrhoids include:

| **Treatment** | **Indication** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|
| Conservative management | Mild symptoms | - Fiber supplements <br/> - Fluids <br/> - Sitz baths <br/> - Topical agents [^114MqQ26] |
| Excisional hemorrhoidectomy | Thrombosed external hemorrhoids | Surgical removal of the thrombosed hemorrhoid, particularly within 72 hours of symptom onset [^112A2DgF] [^112MKBGH] |
| Doppler-guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation (HAL) | Selected cases | Less invasive surgical option with moderate recurrence rates [^11197ZER] |

---

## Clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction

Patients with external hemorrhoids managed conservatively or with surgical excision report **high satisfaction rates** due to effective symptom control and pain relief. In contrast, attempted rubber band ligation of external hemorrhoids results in significant pain and dissatisfaction, with no meaningful clinical benefit.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Rubber band ligation is **not appropriate for external hemorrhoids** because of their location below the dentate line and somatic innervation. Clinicians should adhere to established guidelines and use conservative management or surgical excision for external hemorrhoids, reserving RBL for internal hemorrhoids only [^115gsWnS] [^113As8NL].

### Comparison of rubber band ligation and hemorrhoidectomy in patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids grade III: a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled noninferiority trial [^115xWbsd]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). Medium credibility.

Hemorrhoidal disease is a common anorectal condition characterized by symptoms such as bleeding, pain, itching, soiling, and prolapse, which can significantly affect quality of life (QoL). In the Netherlands, its prevalence is 13.4 per 1000 patients. The Goligher classification system categorizes hemorrhoids by the degree of hemorrhoidal prolapse and guides treatment strategies.

Grade III hemorrhoids represent a particularly complex management scenario due to inconclusive guidelines regarding optimal treatment strategy. Although hemorrhoidectomy is traditionally considered the criterion standard, rubber band ligation (RBL) offers a simpler, less invasive outpatient alternative with fewer complications and lower patient burden. However, RBL has a recurrence rate of up to 50%, potentially requiring repeat procedures. Although hemorrhoidectomy generally has lower recurrence rates, it is associated with more postoperative discomfort and a longer recovery period.

A consensus on the best treatment strategy for grade III hemorrhoids is lacking, leading to variability in clinical practice. – In 2016, 2 large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) compared stapled hemorrhoidopexy with hemorrhoidectomy and hemorrhoidal artery ligation with RBL. However, a direct comparison of RBL with hemorrhoidectomy is still missing. The present study aimed to address this gap by evaluating the clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of RBL versus hemorrhoidectomy in grade III hemorrhoids, focusing on health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) and recurrence rates, and incorporating patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs) to determine patient preferences.

### Endoscopic hemorrhoidal ligation of symptomatic internal hemorrhoids [^114ULshJ]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Background

This study assessed the efficacy of endoscopic hemorrhoidal ligation for treatment of patients with symptoms caused by internal hemorrhoids.

Methods

A total of 576 consecutive patients with symptoms caused by internal hemorrhoids were enrolled in the study. Symptoms were rectal bleeding (239 patients) and prolapse (337 patients). The severity of the hemorrhoids was classified by using the grading system of Goligher.

Results

All patients were treated by the same operator. Mean follow-up was 17.5 months (range 8 to 24 months). The mean number of band ligations per session was 2.86. The mean number of treatment sessions was 1.24. At least one grade reduction in the severity of the hemorrhoids was achieved in most patients (93.58%). Moreover, rectal bleeding was controlled in 228 patients (95.4%), and rectal prolapse was reduced in 310 patients (91.99%). After treatment, 85 patients experienced anal pain, 37 had mild bleeding, 4 developed external hemorrhoidal thrombosis, and one had a peri-anal abscess. The latter 5 patients were treated surgically and recovered uneventfully.

Conclusions

Endoscopic hemorrhoidal ligation is a simple, safe, and effective treatment for patients with symptoms caused by internal hemorrhoids.

### Cost-effectiveness of rubber band ligation versus hemorrhoidectomy for the treatment of grade III hemorrhoids: analysis using evidence from the HOLLAND randomized controlled trial [^115TDRiV]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). Medium credibility.

Coughlin et alreported repeated RBL as cost-effective, with success rates rising from 57% after 1 session to 91% after 4 sessions, although 6% required surgery. They estimated RBL costs at $723 per patient (range, $382–$4430), with a mean QALY of 0.997, concluding sequential banding remained dominant even after multiple sessions. In comparison, hemorrhoidectomy was reported to be 2.75 times more expensive and associated with 9.45 times lower QALYs. However, these findings contrast with our study, which showed greater QALY gains for hemorrhoidectomy at 2-year follow-up.

Methodological differences likely explain these contrasting results. The retrospective design of their study, reliance on historical banding data, and hypothetical cost estimates may have introduced bias. In addition, their inclusion of heterogeneous patient cohorts across all Goligher grades reduced applicability to grade III hemorrhoids. Although repeated RBL demonstrated lower upfront costs, patients requiring surgery after failed RBL faced higher cumulative costs and reduced quality of life, underscoring the importance of individualized treatment planning and comprehensive cost assessments.

Our study demonstrated that hemorrhoidectomy resulted in fewer recurrences, assessed through additional treatments and self-reported recurrences, rather than prolapse severity alone. However, the severity of hemorrhoids in patients reporting recurrence on questionnaires and its implications for treatment remains unclear, as these patients did not seek further treatment yet.

Study Limitations

Several limitations must be acknowledged. First, the intended sample size was not reached, limiting statistical power and precluding broader budget impact analyses. It may also have limited the detection of rare but costly complications, particularly in the hemorrhoidectomy group. This limited sample size was primarily due to high rates of nonparticipation, with many eligible patients declining randomization because of a strong preference for RBL over surgery. Second, reliance on patient-reported outcomes introduces potential recall bias. Third, procedural costs were estimated using average hospital prices rather than detailed bottom-up calculations. Although this approach is reasonable, the lack of pricing transparency and variability in agreements with insurers complicates accurate cost determination in the Dutch health care system. Finally, the number of hemorrhoid piles treated was only systematically recorded in the hemorrhoidectomy group, potentially influencing recurrence comparisons.

Despite these limitations, the use of patient-reported questionnaires to capture health care resource use and societal costs enhances internal validity. The high response rate further minimizes selection bias, strengthening the reliability and generalizability of our findings.

### Retroflexed endoscopic band ligation of bleeding internal hemorrhoids [^11228XMi]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Elastic band ligation is a well-established nonoperative method for treatment of bleeding internal hemorrhoids, stages II-III. Usually, one or two bands are placed at a single session by using rigid instruments. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility, tolerability, safety, and efficacy of multiple band ligation of internal hemorrhoids performed in one session by using a flexible endoscope with an attached band ligation device in the retroflexed position.

Methods

Eighty-three patients with chronically bleeding and/or prolapsing internal hemorrhoids were treated by retroflexed endoscopic band ligation. From 1 to 6 bands were placed in a single session. Bands were targeted at the apex and proximal body of the internal hemorrhoid so that final band placement was entirely proximal to the dentate line. Malpositioned bands were removed by using a novel method. Patients were followed prospectively to assess tolerance, complications, and efficacy. Retreatment was offered if the desired result was not achieved.

Results

A mean of 3.0 (SD 1.2) bands (range 1–6) were placed in a single session. Five percent of bands were malpositioned and removed. Patients were followed for 26 (17) months (range 1–52 months). An excellent result was achieved in 80% of patients with stage II hemorrhoids. Patients with stage II hemorrhoids were more likely to have an excellent result compared with patients with stage III hemorrhoids (80% vs. 54%, p < 0.01). Retroflexed endoscopic band ligation was well tolerated overall. The rate of major, nonfatal complications was 4%.

Conclusions

Retroflexed endoscopic band ligation is a feasible, well-tolerated, effective, and safe for treatment of bleeding stage II internal hemorrhoids. A novel method of endoscopic band removal is described.

Discussion

Recurrence 12 months after HAL was significantly lower than after RBL. Haemorrhoidal disease is a benign condition with treatment primarily aimed at addressing symptoms. In the absence of a validated symptom scoring system, we felt the most important determinant of treatment success was patient-reported outcome of improvement and the need to avoid additional procedures. Where patients had undergone further intervention for haemorrhoids, they were considered to have recurred. Based on this premise, HAL appears superior. This apparent superiority should be put in practical context. 18% of the participants in the RBL group underwent repeat banding. This is common practice and patients might find this re-banding a more palatable option than having an operation if it has the same potential for improvement. Indeed some clinicians deem RBL as a course of treatment. Including these patients as a success (if they reported improvement at 12 months) resulted in a reduction in recurrence and no statistical difference between the groups.

The choice of patient-defined recurrence as our primary outcome was supported by a robust patient and public involvement exercise carried out during trial design. Clinical experience indicates that the physical appearance of the anal cushions post-treatment correlates poorly with patients' symptoms, meaning anorectal visualisation is not a reliable surrogate of success. We therefore asked participants a question, 12 months after intervention, based on a simple, dichotomised definition of recurrence as described by Shanmugam and colleagues. This definition is not universal — indeed no standardised definition of recurrence exists. This is the most obvious explanation for our recurrence rates following HAL, higher than those reported in systematic reviews (11–17.5%). Some previous studies have relied on clinical examination and patient-reported symptoms, others solely on symptomatology. When considering symptoms only, some investigators consider a patient recurrence-free if they have no perianal symptoms at all; others simply an improvement. An example of variation dependent on this definition is provided by one study reporting a recurrence rate of 60%, 30 months after a HAL procedure, yet 86% of patients simultaneously described a significant improvement in symptoms. Other factors that influence recurrence include duration of follow-up. We chose to assess recurrence at 12 months because published data suggest most recurrences occur in less than 1 year. However, our data indicate that persistent symptoms were lower for both groups at 6 weeks (HAL 9% vs RBL 29%) with major deterioration over the year and it is not clear if or when this deterioration plateaus.

### Hemorrhoids [^111DKR4P]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Most patients with hemorrhoids experience only mild symptoms that can be treated with nonprescription topical preparations. Patients usually seek treatment when symptoms increase. Internal hemorrhoids typically present with prolapse or painless rectal bleeding. External hemorrhoids also bleed and can cause acute pain if thrombosed. Medical therapy should be initiated with stool softeners plus local therapy to relieve swelling and symptoms. If medical therapy is inadequate, surgical intervention is warranted. Rubber band ligation is the treatment of choice for grades 1 and 2 hemorrhoids. Rubber band ligation, excisional hemorrhoidectomy, or stapled hemorrhoidopexy can be performed in patients with grade 3 hemorrhoids. Rubber band ligation causes less postoperative pain and fewer complications than excisional hemorrhoidectomy and stapled hemorrhoidopexy, but has a higher recurrence rate. Excisional hemorrhoidectomy or stapled hemorrhoidopexy is recommended for treatment of grade 4 hemorrhoids. Stapled hemorrhoidopexy has a faster postoperative recovery, but a higher recurrence rate. Postoperative pain from excisional hemorrhoidectomy can be treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, narcotics, fiber supplements, and topical antispasmodics. Thrombosed external hemorrhoids can be treated conservatively or excised.

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics 28 (IBM, Armonk, NY). Descriptive methods assessed data quality and homogeneity. Continuous data were presented as mean or median values and categorical data were presented as percentage proportions. A 2-sided p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Primary analyses were conducted in both the intention-to-treat and as-treated populations. The intention-to-treat population included all randomly assigned patients who underwent the intervention and were followed for at least 12 months, excluding those who did not receive any treatment or were lost to follow-up. The as-treated population comprised patients analyzed on the basis of the actual treatment received, including those who crossed over from RBL to hemorrhoidectomy or vice versa. Missing HR-QoL data from the 8 questionnaires over the 2-year period were imputed using predictive mean matching.

For the primary end points, analyses were conducted with a 1-sided alpha value of 0.025. Noninferiority of RBL compared to hemorrhoidectomy was assessed on the basis of QALY difference and recurrence rate. Linear regression with the center as a fixed effect was used to determine noninferiority for HR-QoL, defined as the lower bound of the 95% CI beginning above the –0.05 QALY difference in both the intention-to-treat and as-treated analysis. For recurrence rate, the noninferiority at 12 months postprocedure was assessed against a predefined boundary of a 10% increase of recurrence in the RBL group. Additional comparisons included specific recurrence metrics: further treatments within 12 months and self-reported recurrence up to 24 months.

Secondary outcomes were analyzed using 2-sided t tests or Mann-Whitney U tests for continuous data and relative risk ratios with 95% CIs for binary data, applying a 2-sided alpha value of 0.05. A random intercept linear regression model analyzed repeated measures from various questionnaires, including received treatment and center as fixed effects. For secondary outcomes, no additional imputation techniques were applied, so only the available data are presented.

Evaluation — history and examination: "A disease-specific history and physical examination should be performed, emphasizing the degree and duration of symptoms and risk factors. Strength of recommendation: strong based on low-quality evidence". The diagnosis of hemorrhoids is typically clinical, with "The cardinal sign of internal hemorrhoids is painless bleeding with bowel movements; patients may also complain of intermittent tissue protrusion", while "External hemorrhoids may be difficult to clean, resulting in prolonged contact of fecal material with the perianal skin and local irritation", and "Thrombosed external hemorrhoids present as painful, nonreducible lumps at the anal verge".

Rubber band ligation (RBL) for hemorrhoids — In a 2005 Cochrane review of 3 RCTs (n = 202), surgical hemorrhoidectomy was associated with increased pain (RR 1.94; 95% CI, 1.62–2.33) and complications (RR 6.32; 95% CI, 1.15–34.89) compared with RBL. A meta-analysis found RBL significantly better than sclerotherapy for treatment response and no different in complication rates (p = 0.35); patients treated with sclerotherapy (p = 0.031) or infrared coagulation (IRC; p = 0.0014) were more likely to require further therapy than those treated with RBL, although pain was greater after RBL (p = 0.03 vs sclerotherapy; p < 0.0001 vs IRC). In a single-center retrospective study of 2635 patients, 86.7% were asymptomatic at their 8- week follow-up visit; 22.5% had complications (16.1% pain; 2.8% mild to significant bleeding), and at 2-year follow-up 15.5% reported symptomatic recurrence with repeat RBL in 66.9% or surgical hemorrhoidectomy in 33.1%. Severe bleeding is noted as a rare (~1%) major complication. For patients on antithrombotic therapy, a 2017 systematic review suggested increased risk of massive bleeding, whereas a retrospective case-control cohort of 82 patients undergoing 153 bandings on clopidogrel found no significant difference in bleeding events (3.7% vs 2.7%; p = 0.73). The risk of bleeding should be weighed against thrombotic risk, and clinicians should consider, when possible, pausing antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy; in selected patients on anticoagulant, alternative treatment such as injection sclerotherapy can be considered.

### Pathophysiology of internal hemorrhoids [^1144fP6M]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hemorrhoidal disease is a fairly common and debilitating clinical entity. Despite centuries' of attempts to shed light on its pathophysiology, to cure those affected and to improve sufferers' quality of life, many aspects of the disease remain elusive. Individual beliefs and historical legends, accompanied by undocumented theories, have established and perpetuated the confusion regarding the mechanisms leading to the development of the disease and the rules governing its treatment. Hemorrhoids are classified as internal or external and are viewed as a disease when they become symptomatic. Returning to basic medical sciences, this mini-review focuses on internal hemorrhoids and aims to define the histology and anatomy of the normal and abnormal internal hemorrhoidal plexus and to encourage clinicians to comprehend the pathophysiology of the disease. If doctors can understand the pathophysiology of hemorrhoidal disease, they will be able to clarify the nature of the associated symptoms and complications and to make the correct therapeutic decision.

The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve for willingness to pay up to €50,000 per recurrence avoided shows that the probability of hemorrhoidectomy being cost-effective increases from 98.3% at €20,000 to 99.8% at €50,000, as shown in Figure 4.

Sensitivity Analyses

The differences in mean hospital costs were smaller than those in mean societal costs, resulting in steeper cost-effectiveness acceptability curves and higher probabilities of hemorrhoidectomy being cost-effective from a health care perspective. Specifically, the ICUR for health care costs per QALY was €16,530 (95% BCa CI, 7661–61,400), with probabilities of 65.8% at a €20,000 threshold and 95.8% at €50,000, as shown in Figure 2. For health care costs per recurrence avoided, the ICUR was €4069 (95% BCa CI, 2126–10,731), with probabilities of 99.6% at €20,000 and 99.8% at €50,000, as shown in Figure 4.

Scenario analyses based on increased treatment costs (a 20% increase) and high-cost estimates derived from hospital tariffs consistently showed lower health care costs for RBL compared to hemorrhoidectomy. In all scenarios, the ICERs and ICURs were in favor of hemorrhoidectomy due to its higher effectiveness (see Supplemental Table 2 at).

In the broader sensitivity analyses, total societal costs varied by ± 20%, separately for health care costs and productivity losses (see Supplemental Table 3 at). In all scenarios, RBL was associated with lower mean costs compared to hemorrhoidectomy. The ICERs ranged from €21,040 to €27,044 per QALY when varying health care costs and from €22,236 to €25,848 per QALY when varying productivity losses.

### Comparison of stapled haemorrhoidopexy with traditional excisional surgery for haemorrhoidal disease (eTHoS): a pragmatic, multicentre, randomised controlled trial [^116SgvDp]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Haemorrhoids are swellings of the sub mucosal veins at the top of the anal canal. Symptoms from haemorrhoids include bleeding, pain, prolapse and peri-anal itch with prevalence rates of up to 44% within the general population. A substantial proportion of the population will have symptoms of haemorrhoids within their lifetime and the presence of per-rectal bleeding, and its association with colorectal cancer, can cause anxiety.

The initial management of haemorrhoids is community based, where no concern exists about the presence of colorectal cancer or inflammatory bowel disease. Dietary manipulation, bulk forming laxatives, and advice should be offered first. Persistent symptoms merit referral for investigation and treatment. Outpatient treatment principally involves rubber band ligation for lower grade haemorrhoids, whereas surgical interventions are used for higher grade haemorrhoids where banding has been unsuccessful. Rubber band ligation is a clinic-based procedure where a small band is placed at the top of a haemorrhoid to reduce its size by interfering with tissue blood supply. The widely adopted Goligher systemfor grading haemorrhoids was used in this trial.

Pain and Use of Analgesics

Postoperative pain scores were similar on day 1 (median VAS 4 vs 6, p = 0.071) but higher in the hemorrhoidectomy group by week 1 (median VAS 1 vs 4, p = 0.002), consistent with their worst pain experience (median VAS 3 vs 8, p < 0.001; Table 5). More hemorrhoidectomy participants used analgesics at day 1 (97% vs 73%) and week 1 (100% vs 48%), although most used paracetamol or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, with 33% still using opioids. Analgesic use lasted shorter in the RBL group (median 3 vs 7 days, p < 0.001). By week 6, pain scores and analgesic use were similar between the groups (Table 6).

Patient-Reported Outcome Measures

Over 24 months, PROMs showed significant improvements favoring the hemorrhoidectomy group in HSS, PROM-HISS, and EQ-5D-5L scores, whereas no differences were found in ProctoPROM or Vaizey scores (Table 8). Both groups showed overall improvement in all PROM scores compared to preprocedure levels (see Supplemental Tables 5–10 at).

Quality of Life and Recurrence Rate

Quality of life, expressed in QALYs, was 1.90 (95% CI, 1.84–1.95) in the hemorrhoidectomy group and 1.82 (95% CI, 1.77–1.87) in the RBL group, with a difference of 0.08 QALYs (95% CI, 0.06–0.16; p = 0.034). The recurrence rate in the RBL group was 45.7% (95% CI, 31.2%–60.8%), compared to 12.1% (95% CI, 4.0–29.1%) in the hemorrhoidectomy group. This corresponds to an absolute risk difference of 33.5% (95% CI, 15.3–51.7%; p = 0.002) in favor of the hemorrhoidectomy group. Further details on self-reported recurrence rates and additional treatments after the index procedure are presented in Table 4.

Incremental Cost-Utility and Cost-Effectiveness Analyses

From a societal perspective, over the 24-month time horizon of the trial, the hemorrhoidectomy strategy resulted in an increase of €1984 in costs, 0.08 more QALYs, and a 33.5% lower recurrence rate compared to the RBL strategy.

The point-estimated ICUR, representing the cost per QALY gained, was €24,042 (95% BCa CI, 2453–160,603) in the base-case scenario. Figure 1 presents the cost-effectiveness plane, showing the mean societal costs against the mean differences in QALYs based on 1000 bootstrap simulations. The vast majority (97.2%) of these bootstraps fell within the upper-right quadrant, indicating that the hemorrhoidectomy strategy is more effective but also more expensive than RBL.

### Rubber band ligation of hemorrhoids: is the procedure effective for the immunocompromised, hemophiliacs and pregnant women? [^116hafLX]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hemorrhoidal disease, one of the most common conditions of the perianal region, is defined as the symptomatic enlargement and/or distal displacement of the normal functional structures called anal cushions, at which point they begin to prolapse, bleed or become strangulated. It is characterized by remarkably dilated, thin-walled vessels within the submucosal arteriovenous plexus, with absent or nearly-flat sphincter-like constriction of the vessels. In 1980, Goligher classified internal hemorrhoids according to the severity of examination findings: grade I – bleeding only, without prolapse; grade II – prolapse that reduces spontaneously with or without bleeding; grade III – prolapse requiring manual reduction, with or without bleeding; and grade IV – irreducible prolapse of hemorrhoidal tissue.

Treatment choices include conservative, non-surgical and surgical options. Conservative management consists of diet and lifestyle modifications such as a high-fiber diet, increased water intake, avoidance of prolonged straining, and medical options with oral flavonoids and topical ointments. Office-based options include rubber band ligation (RBL), cryosurgery and infrared coagulation, among others. Surgical treatment is reserved mainly for patients in whom the conservative therapeutic approach has failed, or for patients with advanced disease (grade IV).

RBL is considered the most effective, painless, office-based option for grade I-III hemorrhoids, easily performed on an outpatient basis. It consists of positioning elastic bands above the dentate line to strangulate the hemorrhoidal nodules, thus leaving an area where inflammation fixates the mucosa to the submucosa, preventing recurrence. The Guidelines for hemorrhoidal disease from 2020 European Society of Coloproctology suggest it as a first-line treatment, since it is less invasive, has fewer and/or less serious reported complications, and is quicker and cheaper than other options. However, it is of interest to focus on the authors' reference to "special situations", including inflammatory bowel disease, irradiation, immunodeficiency, pregnancy and coagulation disorders. In this specific section, the lack of satisfactory literature on the risks and effectiveness of RBL vs. surgery in such patients is emphasized.

### Hemorrhoidal disease: a review [^112MKBGH]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hemorrhoidal disease, pathology of the tissue lining of the anal canal, affects approximately 10 million individuals in the US. Hemorrhoidal disease may impair quality of life due to bleeding, pain, anal irritation, and tissue prolapse.

Observations

Hemorrhoids are classified as internal, external, or mixed (concurrent internal and external hemorrhoidal disease). Internal hemorrhoids originate above the dentate line, the boundary between the upper and lower anal canal, and may cause rectal bleeding, discomfort, and tissue prolapse from the anal canal. Internal hemorrhoid prolapse is classified as grade I (into anal canal), grade II (beyond the anus with spontaneous reduction), grade III (requiring manual reduction), and grade IV (irreducible). External hemorrhoids, arising below the dentate line, cause rectal pain when engorged or thrombosed. Initial treatment of all hemorrhoidal disease involves increasing intake of dietary fiber and water and avoiding straining during defecation. Phlebotonics (eg, flavonoids [thought to improve venous tone]) reduce bleeding, rectal pain, and swelling, although symptom recurrence reaches 80% within 3 to 6 months after treatment cessation. If dietary modification and phlebotonics are ineffective, grade I to grade III internal hemorrhoidal disease can be treated with office-based interventions. Rubber band ligation-placing a band around the base of hemorrhoid tissue during anoscopy to restrict blood flow-resolves symptoms in 89% of patients, but repeated banding is needed in up to 20%. Sclerotherapy, which induces fibrosis with a sclerosant injection, is efficacious in the short term (weeks to months) among 70% to 85% of patients, but long-term remission occurs in only one-third of patients. Infrared coagulation uses heat to coagulate hemorrhoidal tissue, yielding 70% to 80% success in reducing bleeding and prolapse. Excisional hemorrhoidectomy, for disease unresponsive to office-based therapy or for mixed hemorrhoidal disease, achieves low recurrence (2%-10%), although with longer recovery (9–14 days). External hemorrhoidal disease rarely requires surgery unless acutely thrombosed. Outpatient clot evacuation within 72 hours of onset of a thrombosed external hemorrhoid is associated with decreased pain and reduced risk of repeat thrombosis. Patients presenting more than 72 hours after external hemorrhoid acute thrombosis should receive medical treatment (eg, stool softeners, oral and topical analgesics such as 5% lidocaine).

Conclusions and Relevance

Hemorrhoidal disease affects 10 million people in the US. First-line treatment is increased fiber intake, avoidance of straining during defecation, and phlebotonics. In-office rubber band ligation for grade I to III internal hemorrhoid disease is first-line procedural treatment for persistent symptoms despite conservative therapies. Excisional hemorrhoidectomy is recommended for grade III to IV prolapse, thrombosis, or mixed hemorrhoidal disease that does not improve with less invasive approaches.

### The role of endoscopy in patients with anorectal disorders [^1151Rb8z]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2010). Medium credibility.

Internal hemorrhoids — nonsurgical management and comparative outcomes include fiber therapy, sclerotherapy, rubber band ligation (RBL), infrared photocoagulation, electrocoagulation, cryotherapy, and low-voltage direct current. RBL is described as effective and feasible with flexible or rigid endoscopes. Suction band ligators were not superior to forceps ligation in a randomized study of 100 patients. In 45 patients with chronic rectal bleeding due to second- and third-degree internal hemorrhoids randomized to RBL or bipolar coagulation therapy, success was higher with RBL (92% vs 62%, P < .05) with a similar safety profile.

Concluding remarks

Overall, hemorrhoidal disease is a quite common and annoying disease, by definition symptomatic. It is imperative for clinicians who manage patients with internal hemorrhoids (gastroenterologists, surgeons, general practitioners) to be familiar with the normal and abnormal anatomy of hemorrhoids and to be capable of correlating their clinical findings with the subsequent pathophysiology. The pathophysiological explanation of clinical and/or endoscopic signs is an indispensable component of the roadmap to successful treatment of the hemorrhoidal patient.

Purpose Of Review

To review the literature within the last 5 years on the current status and future perspectives of the endoscopic management of internal hemorrhoids.

Recent Findings

Despite the large burden of hemorrhoidal diseases, research in this area, particularly on endoscopic approaches for treatment, has been slow. Within the last 5 years, data has been published on the novel cap-assisted endoscopic sclerotherapy (CAES), which will continue to gain attention in the future. Rubber band ligation has been adopted by the endoscopist as endoscopic rubber band ligation (ERBL), demonstrating satisfactory results in treating symptomatic hemorrhoids, although mild postprocedure complications are common. Data is needed on head-to-head comparisons between ERBL, endoscopic sclerotherapy, and CAES. Other methods, such as coagulation, are understudied and should be explored further in the endoscopic setting. Meaningful comparisons between treatment methods for internal hemorrhoids have been difficult because of variations in interventional techniques and methods, differences in the grading of hemorrhoids, and lack of standardization of clinical trials. The Goligher classification alone is inadequate for determining the management of symptomatic hemorrhoids and this warrants revision.

Summary

Gastroenterologists are poised to assume a greater role in the management of internal hemorrhoids with flexible endoscopy. Current endoscopic treatment options require further study.

Treatment parameters of the study groups

Regarding major complications, only 3 were observed in our study groups: (i) one hemophiliac patient presented with rectal bleeding 7 days after the first banding. On proctoscopy the bleeding site was identified at the site of the previous banding; another rubber band was then applied, ensuring complete hemostasis and the patient was discharged 2 h later; no transfusion was required; (ii) One HIV-positive patient presented with severe anal pain 24 h after banding. Physical examination revealed the presence of a thrombosed external hemorrhoid, managed with incision and drainage under local anesthesia, with complete resolution of symptoms. Although this event was not directly related to any of the ligation sites, we include this complication in our data; and (iii) one young lady from the pregnancy control group experienced severe rectal pain a few hours after banding. Although on proctoscopy the band was well placed above the dentate line, she required opioids and eventually removal of the band for symptom control. Twelve more patients experienced pain that resolved with oral paracetamol: 4 and 2 in the hemophilia and control groups, respectively, and 3 and 3 in the HIV-positive and control groups.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of hemorrhoids [^112PayLv]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2024). High credibility.

Stapled hemorrhoidopexy (SH) is not routinely recommended as a first-line surgical treatment for internal hemorrhoids given its marginal efficacy and significant risk profile. Strength of recommendation: conditional based on moderate-quality evidence. SH uses a circular stapling device to create a mucosa-to-mucosa anastomosis by excising the submucosa proximal to the dentate resulting in cephalad fixation of the anal cushions and interruption of the feeding arteries, and although effective for prolapsing internal hemorrhoids, it does not address external hemorrhoids. In a randomized trial of 777 patients, SH produced less pain and better quality of life within 6 weeks (p = 0.02), but the EH group had fewer recurrent symptoms (OR 2.96; 95% CI, 2.02–4.32), lower tenesmus/incontinence rates (p = 0.01), and higher 24‑month quality of life. A Cochrane review showed SH patients were more likely to have recurrent hemorrhoids than those with excisional hemorrhoidectomy (12 trials, 955 patients; OR 3.22; 95% CI, 1.59–6.51), and more symptomatic prolapse at all time points (13 studies, 1191 patients; OR 2.65; 95% CI, 1.45–4.85).

Hemorrhoids — surgical referral criteria and options — gastroenterologists and other providers should refer for surgical operations (hemorrhoidectomy, stapled hemorrhoidopexy, and Doppler-assisted hemorrhoidal artery ligation) those patients who are refractory to or cannot tolerate office procedures, who have large, symptomatic external tags along with their hemorrhoids, who have large third-degree hemorrhoids, or who have fourth-degree hemorrhoids (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). Traditional hemorrhoidectomy remains very effective, stapled hemorrhoidopexy shows slightly lower complication rates but higher long-term recurrence rates compared with standard hemorrhoidectomy and is an established alternative in most cases, and for Doppler-assisted hemorrhoidal artery ligation success rates are comparable to hemorrhoidectomy and stapled hemorrhoidopexy although comparative studies are lacking.

### Comparison of rubber band ligation and hemorrhoidectomy in patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids grade III: a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled noninferiority trial [^113Ns9UZ]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). Medium credibility.

Interventions

Before randomization, all patients received conservative treatments, including dietary counseling, stool hygiene, toilet habits, fiber supplementation, and local therapies such as vasoconstrictors, prescribed at the surgeon's discretion per the pragmatic study design.

Rubber band ligation

The details of the RBL procedure are outlined in the study protocol. In brief, up to 2 RBL sessions were permitted if symptoms persisted after the initial procedure, allowing flexibility in addressing ongoing symptoms, consistent with standard clinical practice. Given that RBL treatment often entails repeated sessions for grade III hemorrhoids, this study hypothesized that repeated RBL (up to 2 sessions) would be noninferior to hemorrhoidectomy regarding HR-QoL and recurrence rates while being more cost-effective.

Hemorrhoidectomy

Hemorrhoidectomy was performed using either the open techniqueor the closed technique, both of which are aimed at excising hemorrhoidal cushions using electrocautery. A more detailed description of both techniques can be found in the published study protocol.

Data Collection

Clinical data were collected at baseline, intervention, and 6-week follow-up, with some assessments conducted by phone due to COVID-19. Data included demographics, medical history, Rome IV criteria for chronic constipation, pelvic floor physiotherapy, symptom duration, and previous treatments. Procedural data covered intervention details and complications. The postoperative period covered the first 90 days after treatment, recording complications such as bleeding requiring hospitalization or transfusion, urinary retention, wound discharge, anal fissure, anal fistula, emergency surgery, anal stenosis, fecal incontinence, or death. Data on discharge, readmissions, and further treatments were also collected.

Subsequent data collection through questionnaires occurred at baseline, 1 day, 1 week, 6 weeks, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months posttreatment. Assessments included the European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) score, self-reported recurrence, pain (visual analog scale [VAS]), analgesic use, return to work, and various PROMs: PROM–hemorrhoidal impact and satisfaction score (PROM-HISS), Hemorrhoid Severity Score (HSS), Vaizey incontinence score, and proctoPROM. These PROMs provided comprehensive evaluations of patient outcomes and treatment effectiveness.

### Twenty years of a veterans' spinal cord injury colorectal clinic: flexible sigmoidoscopy and multiple hemorrhoid ligation [^1164cdkR]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Colorectal and anal problems arise in chronic spinal cord injury care. We review 20 years of experience in a colorectal clinic at a veterans medical center treating mostly male veterans who have spinal cord injury.

Objective

We aim to show the results of colorectal interventions in a population with chronic spinal cord injury.

Design

This study is a retrospective records review.

Settings

This study was conducted at a Department of Veterans Affairs regional spinal cord injury center.

Patients

Six hundred forty-one individuals (625 males) made 1208 visits. Mean age was 56 ± 13 years; ages ranged from 21 to 90 years.

Interventions

Flexible sigmoidoscopy was done for diagnosis and screening, and hemorrhoid ligation was performed for symptomatic hemorrhoids.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcomes measured were the frequency, timing, and results of procedures.

Results

Five hundred forty-eight people had 781 flexible sigmoidoscopies. At first examination, mean age was 65 ± 12 and the duration of injury was 19 ± 15 years. Sixty examinations (7.7%) displayed poor preparation. The interval between adequate-prepared examinations was 5.7 ± 2.0 years. The adenoma detection rate was 4.7%. Two hundred fifteen people had 406 hemorrhoid ligations. At first banding, the mean age was 52 ± 13 and the duration of injury was 20 ± 15 years. Mean number of ligations per procedure was 4.9 ± 2.0; a range of 1 to 20. Nine hemorrhoid operations were done in this period. Regarding the futility of procedures, 250 people died, with a mean age at death of 69 ± 11. The median time between any procedure and death was 4.4 years. Seventeen procedures were done within 6 months of death; these deaths were either unexpected or because of conditions identified at or after the procedure.

Limitations

This was a retrospective review of a single institution, it involved a mostly male population, and it used a subjective assessment of bowel preparation.

Conclusions

In a spinal cord injury colorectal clinic, sigmoidoscopy can keep screening current, with an acceptable level of poor preparation. The adenoma detection rate may or may not be adequate. Hemorrhoid ligation can be expanded beyond its limits in the non-spinal cord-injured population, including multiple and external banding, taking the place of an operation in most cases. These procedures are well tolerated and rarely futile.

Understanding of hemorrhoidal pathology and treatment has come a long way. The theory of a sliding anal canal lining and the knowledge that hemorrhoidal cushions are a normal part of the anal anatomy should encourage symptom control rather than radical removal of tissue. Techniques that fix the cushions back in position can be performed in outpatients with reasonable success rates. When required, surgery should be aimed at symptomatic hemorrhoids. It is hoped that new developments such as circular stapling and better pain management will promote increased day surgery, better pain control, and less time off work for patients.

### Comparison of efficacy and safety between surgical and conservative treatments for hemorrhoids: a meta-analysis [^116sGqgG]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hemorrhoids is one of the most prevalent anorectal conditions globally, significantly affecting the quality of life of millions of patients due to symptoms such as pain, bleeding, and prolapse. the prevalence of hemorrhoids varies significantly, with factors such as obesity, abdominal obesity, depression, and prior pregnancy identified as significant risk factors These physical symptoms can lead to discomfort during daily activities and reduced quality of life, emphasizing the importance of effective management strategies.

Management strategies for hemorrhoidal disease primarily include surgical and conservative treatments. Surgical interventions, such as hemorrhoidectomy, are highly effective for alleviating severe symptoms in the short term. Hemorrhoidectomy remains the gold standard for advanced disease due to its definitive symptom relief; however, it is associated with considerable postoperative pain, urinary retention, and complications such as anal stenosis. On the other hand, conservative management encompasses pharmacological interventions, dietary modifications, and completely non-invasive therapies, offering a less invasive alternative for mild to moderate cases. Dietary and lifestyle modifications, including increased fiber intake, are often the first therapeutic steps for improving symptoms such as bleeding and prolapse. Although some reviews and meta-analyses have classified office-based procedures like rubber band ligation, sclerotherapy, and infrared coagulation as part of conservative management, the 2024 guidelines from the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons exclude these modalities from the definition of conservative treatment. Consequently, our study did not included the office-based procedures to ensure a clearer evaluation of conservative management options.

Despite the widespread use of these surgical and conservative interventions, there remains a lack of comprehensive, comparative evidence synthesizing their relative efficacy and safety. This study aims to address these gaps by conducting a rigorous meta-analysis to evaluate and compare the outcomes of surgical versus conservative treatments for hemorrhoids. By systematically analyzing data on key outcomes such as symptom relief, recurrence rates, and complication occurence, this research would provide evidence-based insights to guide clinical decision-making and optimize individualized treatment strategies.

Infrared coagulation (IRC) outcomes and comparisons — In 4 RCTs (n = 339), bleeding resolution with IRC was reported as 78% for grade I, 52% for grade II, and 22% for grade III hemorrhoids; postprocedure pain ranged 16% to 100% and postprocedure bleeding 15% to 44%. In an RCT of 133 patients, long-term (> 1 year) satisfaction was 80% with IRC versus 82% with rubber band ligation (RBL) (p = 0.39), while pain after treatment was more common and more severe after RBL (VAS 5.5 ± 3.7) than IRC (VAS 3.3 ± 3.3; p = 0.018). A meta-analysis of 9 RCTs found no significant difference between IRC and RBL for efficacy, postoperative prolapse, recurrence, or postoperative urine retention, but patients undergoing RBL had worse postoperative pain and less postoperative bleeding than patients undergoing IRC.

### Comparison of efficacy and safety between surgical and conservative treatments for hemorrhoids: a meta-analysis [^113hV3Ws]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Hemorrhoids, a common anorectal condition, can be managed through surgical or conservative treatments. The aim of this meta-analysis is to compare the efficacy and safety of surgical and conservative treatments for hemorrhoids.

Methods

A systematic search was conducted from of PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science from their inception to September 25, 2024. Eligible studies compared surgical treatments with non-invasive conservative treatments in hemorrhoids. Statistical analyses included pooled odds ratios (ORs) and mean differences (MDs)/standard mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results

Seven studies, including 760 patients, were analyzed. Surgery achieved higher rates of complete symptom resolution than conservative therapy (OR = 2.96, 95% CI: 1.66–5.28, p < 0.001). Overall pain scores favored surgery (SMD = -0.93, 95% CI: 1.73 to -0.13, p = 0.02). Subgroup analysis showed clear superiority within four days (SMD = -1.26, 95% CI -1.84 to -0.68) but parity beyond ten days (SMD = 0.00, 95% CI -0.44 to 0.44; p = 0.99). Comparable patterns were observed in pregnant women with thrombosed external hemorrhoids. Rates of postoperative bleeding (OR: 1.09; 95% CI: 0.42 to 2.82, p = 0.86; I2 = 41%, p = 0.15) and urinary retention (OR: 1.75; 95% CI: 0.30 to 10.31, p = 0.54; I2 = 45%, p = 0.18) did not differ significantly between groups. Surgical-specific adverse events were infrequent (incontinence 3%, persistent pain 5%, watery discharge 6%). Surgery shortened recovery in pregnant thrombosed cases by approximately seven days (MD: -6.80; 95% CI: -7.64 to -5.96, p < 0.001; I2 = 55%, p = 0.14) and reduced overall recurrence (95% CI: 0.10 to 0.37, p < 0.001; I2 = 0%, p = 0.97).

Conclusion

Surgical treatments provide superior symptom relief, faster recovery, and lower recurrence but with some specific post-treatment complications, while conservative treatments are safer and less invasive but with provides slower symptom relief and higher recurrence rates. Individualized treatment should consider symptom severity, patient preferences, and risk tolerance.

### Hemorrhoids: diagnosis and treatment options [^114MqQ26]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Many Americans between 45 and 65 years of age experience hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoidal size, thrombosis, and location (i.e., proximal or distal to the dentate line) determine the extent of pain or discomfort. The history and physical examination must assess for risk factors and clinical signs indicating more concerning disease processes. Internal hemorrhoids are traditionally graded from I to IV based on the extent of prolapse. Other factors such as degree of discomfort, bleeding, comorbidities, and patient preference should help determine the order in which treatments are pursued. Medical management (e.g., stool softeners, topical over-the-counter preparations, topical nitroglycerine), dietary modifications (e.g., increased fiber and water intake), and behavioral therapies (sitz baths) are the mainstays of initial therapy. If these are unsuccessful, office-based treatment of grades I to III internal hemorrhoids with rubber band ligation is the preferred next step because it has a lower failure rate than infrared photocoagulation. Open or closed (conventional) excisional hemorrhoidectomy leads to greater surgical success rates but also incurs more pain and a prolonged recovery than office-based procedures; therefore, hemorrhoidectomy should be reserved for recurrent or higher-grade disease. Closed hemorrhoidectomy with diathermic or ultrasonic cutting devices may decrease bleeding and pain. Stapled hemorrhoidopexy elevates grade III or IV hemorrhoids to their normal anatomic position by removing a band of proximal mucosal tissue; however, this procedure has several potential postoperative complications. Hemorrhoidal artery ligation may be useful in grade II or III hemorrhoids because patients may experience less pain and recover more quickly. Excision of thrombosed external hemorrhoids can greatly reduce pain if performed within the first two to three days of symptoms.

Doppler-guided hemorrhoid artery ligation may be used for patients with internal hemorrhoids. Compared with excisional hemorrhoidectomy, this approach may result in decreased pain but increased recurrence rates. Strength of recommendation: conditional based on moderate-quality evidence. In a systematic review, recurrence ranged between 3% and 60% (pooled recurrence rate 17.5%), with postoperative bleeding 5%, reintervention 6.4%, and operative time 19 to 35 minutes. A single-institution series of 1000 HAL cases reported overall complications 6.8% (tenesmus 3.1%, urinary retention 2.3%, bleeding 1.4%); after 36 months, recurrence was 9.5% and 7% required subsequent surgery. Versus rubber band ligation (RBL), 1-year recurrence was 49% with RBL vs 30% with HAL (OR 2.23; 95% CI, 1.42–3.51), and more RBL patients needed additional procedures (32% vs 14%; p < 0.001). Compared with stapled hemorrhoidopexy (SH), HAL showed lower pain scores (2.0 vs 3.3; p = 0.002) but higher recurrence (13.2% vs 6.9%; OR 1.93; 95% CI, 1.07–3.51). In an RCT of 393 grade II–III hemorrhoid patients, HAL had lower week-2 pain (1.3 vs 1.9; p = 0.01), no difference in analgesic use (37% vs 44%; p = 0.17), and higher 6‑month recurrence (25.1% vs 13.8%; p = 0.049) vs SH. Compared with excisional hemorrhoidectomy (EH), an 80‑patient multicenter RCT showed more ongoing NSAID use after week 2 with EH (87.8% vs 53.8%; p = 0.002), while a 98‑patient RCT found higher 1‑year recurrent prolapse with HAL (59% vs 31%; p = 0.008).

### Pathophysiology of internal hemorrhoids [^112nkkP9]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Normal anatomy and histology of hemorrhoids

Hemorrhoids are normal structures of the human body. Internal hemorrhoids arise from the internal hemorrhoidal plexus, while external hemorrhoids arise from the external plexus. The anatomical boundary that divides the internal from the external hemorrhoidal plexus is the dentate line. The normal internal hemorrhoidal plexus consists of 3 soft engorgements, referred to as anal cushions or "hemorrhoids". Consequently, the term "internal hemorrhoids" does not signify a state of disease if viewed in its strict literal definition. However, in clinical practice the term "internal hemorrhoids" is used to describe solely the disease resulting from the abnormal enlargement of anal cushions, i.e. their transformation to anal nodules. More precisely, this definition is limited to symptomatic hemorrhoidal disease: i.e. anal cushions are named "hemorrhoids" when they bleed and/or prolapse.

The internal hemorrhoidal plexus is placed submucosally above the dentate line and below the anorectal ring. It extends from the upper border of the anatomical anal canal to the upper border of the surgical anal canal. It is located, therefore, outside the anatomical anal canal. It is covered by transitional columnar epithelium and originates embryologically by the cloacal part of the anal canal, which contains both ectodermal and endodermal elements.

Thrombosed external hemorrhoid — urgent management — most patients who present urgently (within ~3 days of onset) with a thrombosed external hemorrhoid benefit from excision (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence), and most excisions can be safely performed in the office or emergency room, with an injection of a local anesthetic.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^114oZaux]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

No recommendation can be made regarding the role of office-based procedures (i.e. rubber band ligation, sclerotherapy, infrared coagulation) in complicated hemorrhoids, based on the available literature.

The literature regarding the utilization of office-based procedures (i.e. rubber band ligation, injection sclerotherapy, infrared coagulation, cryotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, laser therapy, etcetera) is significant but generally heterogeneous and of low quality: the number of published studies is enormous and the definition of bleeding or symptomatic hemorrhoids is always unclear. Regarding sclerotherapy, there are anecdotal reports of its application in patients with acutely bleeding hemorrhoids.

For these reasons, there is not enough quality data to make any recommendation regarding the application of office-based procedures to manage complicated hemorrhoids.
3.F - in patients with complicated hemorrhoids, what are the indications for surgical treatment and what is the appropriate timing for surgery?

In patients with thrombosed hemorrhoids, we suggest to base the decision between non-operative management and early surgical excision on local expertise and patient's preference (weak recommendation based on low quality evidence, 2C).

In patients with thrombosed hemorrhoids, we suggest against the use of incision and drainage of the thrombus (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

No recommendation can be made regarding the role of surgery in patients with bleeding hemorrhoids, based on the available literature.

Despite the high incidence of complicated hemorrhoids among the general population, there are only few studies on the surgical treatment of thrombosed hemorrhoids and none on bleeding hemorrhoids. Furthermore, the definitions of "thrombosed hemorrhoids", "hemorrhoidal crisis", "prolapsed hemorrhoids", and "bleeding hemorrhoids" are multiple and confusing, and most of the currently available studies focus on chronic complaints and elective procedures. The evidence is thus scarce and of low quality, making it extremely difficult to provide evidence-based recommendations.

### Comparison of rubber band ligation and hemorrhoidectomy in patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids grade III: a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled noninferiority trial [^117QFtBC]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). Medium credibility.

Current Dutch guidelines for grade III hemorrhoids include shared decision-making, presenting hemorrhoidectomy or initial RBL as options, and recommending surgery if symptoms persist after 4 RBL sessions. In our study, only 1 patient exceeded this threshold, opting out of surgery.

In the hemorrhoidectomy group, 1 patient required a second Ligasure procedure, which successfully resolved symptoms. No differences in outcomes were observed between open and closed excisional techniques. Self-reported recurrence rates in this study were lower than those reported in the eTHoS trial (0% vs 14% at 12 months and 6.7% vs 25% at 24 months), likely due to our focus on grade III hemorrhoids. Conversely, recurrence rates were higher than those reported in our previous meta-analysis (31% for RBL vs 6% for hemorrhoidectomy). However, the studies included in the meta-analysis were of poor quality, particularly in their definitions of recurrence and follow-up periods.

The skewed treatment allocation (47 vs 40) resulted from stratification by the center with permuted blocks of random sizes, but baseline characteristics remained comparable. Notably, 42% of patients met the Rome IV criteria for functional constipation, emphasizing the importance of addressing underlying bowel issues when planning hemorrhoid treatment. The shorter waiting time of the RBL for intervention may provide an advantage in quickly managing severe symptoms. However, the median waiting time for surgery in our study (50 days; IQR, 27–88) was still shorter than reported in other studies.

Both groups experienced minimal complications, indicating that RBL and hemorrhoidectomy are safe treatment options for grade III hemorrhoids. Our findings align with those of previous trials, showing a slight reduction in mean Vaizey scores after both interventions, probably attributed to prolapse correction.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of hemorrhoids [^114sJ4Wd]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2024). High credibility.

Excisional hemorrhoidectomy (EH) indications, comparative effectiveness, and complications — 7. Excisional hemorrhoidectomy should typically be offered to select patients with external hemorrhoids or patients with symptomatic combined internal and external hemorrhoids (grades III–IV). Strength of recommendation: strong based on high-quality evidence. Surgical excision is an effective approach for patients who fail, cannot tolerate, or are not candidates for office-based procedures or who have concomitant external hemorrhoidal disease. In a meta-analysis of 11 RCTs (n = 1326), the closed approach versus open had decreased postoperative pain, faster wound healing, and decreased risk of postoperative bleeding, with similar postoperative complications, hemorrhoid recurrence, and infectious complications. Energy devices show mixed advantages: a meta-analysis of 5 studies (n = 318) found bipolar energy devices faster, with less postoperative pain and comparable complication rates to closed hemorrhoidectomy using electrocautery; a meta-analysis of 8 studies (n = 468) found ultrasonic shears associated with earlier return to work, decreased postoperative pain, and fewer postoperative complications, but an RCT of 60 patients found similar postoperative pain scores and no differences in clinical outcomes versus electrocautery. Serious complications are rare; postprocedural hemorrhage occurs in 1%–2% in most large series, and acute urinary retention occurs in 1% to 15% and is the most common reason for delayed discharge; risk may be mitigated by decreasing intraoperative intravenous fluids to < 750 mL and using adequate analgesia. Long-term complications can include anal stricture and incontinence.

RESULTS

Baseline

During a 37-month period (September 2019–November 2022), concluding with the final questionnaire on November 1, 2024, a total of 79 patients (33 hemorrhoidectomy vs 46 rubber band ligation) were recruited in the trial's study population. The flowchart detailing the study population and group distribution was previously published alongside the clinical results and is provided as Supplemental Figure 1 at. Baseline characteristics of the study population are summarized in Table 2. The overall response rate for all questionnaires was 88%, with specific response rates for the long-term follow-up questionnaires of 90%, 87%, and 84% at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively.

TABLE 2.
Baseline characteristics

Resource Use and Costs

The mean resource use volumes and associated costs for each treatment strategy are presented in Table 3, with total hospital and societal costs for both the base- and high-case procedural cost scenarios summarized at the bottom.

TABLE 3.
Mean costs per treatment category

In the base-case scenario, the mean total hospital costs were €2683 (95% CI, 2325–3041) for the hemorrhoidectomy strategy and €1318 (95% CI, 1014–1622) for the RBL strategy, resulting in a statistically significant mean difference of €1364 (95% CI, 895–1834; p < 0.001) in favor of RBL. Under the high-case scenario for study procedures, this difference increased to €1752 (95% CI, 1206–2298; p < 0.001).

Conversely, mean total societal costs were €6259 (95% CI, 4648–7869) for the hemorrhoidectomy group and €4274 (95% CI, 2905–5644) for the RBL group, yielding a mean difference of €1984 (95% CI, –132 to 4101; p = 0.066) in favor of RBL, although not statistically significant. In the high-case scenario, mean societal costs were €6,851 (95% CI, 5219–8483) for the hemorrhoidectomy group versus €4479 (95% CI, 3092–5867) for the RBL group, with an increased mean difference of €2372 (95% CI, 227–4516; p = 0.031), which was statistically significant.

### Cost-effectiveness of rubber band ligation versus hemorrhoidectomy for the treatment of grade III hemorrhoids: analysis using evidence from the HOLLAND randomized controlled trial [^112qrneH]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND:

Hemorrhoids significantly impact quality of life and health care costs. Although rubber band ligation and hemorrhoidectomy are common treatments for grade III hemorrhoids, comparative cost-effectiveness data are limited.

OBJECTIVE:

To assess the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of rubber band ligation compared to hemorrhoidectomy from a societal perspective within the context of the HOLLAND trial.

DESIGN:

Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses using data from a multicenter, randomized controlled trial.

SETTINGS:

Ten Dutch hospitals participating in the HOLLAND trial.

PATIENTS:

Adults with symptomatic grade III hemorrhoids randomly assigned to receive rubber band ligation or hemorrhoidectomy treatment.

INTERVENTIONS:

Rubber band ligation (up to 2 sessions) or excisional hemorrhoidectomy.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:

Cost per quality-adjusted life year gained and cost per recurrence avoided over 24 months from a societal perspective.

RESULTS:

Seventy-nine patients were analyzed (33 for hemorrhoidectomy and 46 for rubber band ligation). Hemorrhoidectomy resulted in better clinical outcomes with a quality-adjusted life year difference of 0.08 (95% CI, 0.04–0.13) and a recurrence difference of 33.5% (95% CI, 15.3%–51.7%). Hospital costs were higher for hemorrhoidectomy (€1364; 95% CI, 895–1834; p < 0.001), as were societal costs (€1984; 95% CI, –132 to 4101; p = 0.066). The incremental cost-utility ratio for hemorrhoidectomy was €24,042 per quality-adjusted life year gained, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was €5918 per recurrence avoided. The probability of hemorrhoidectomy being cost-effective was 45.5% at €20,000 per quality-adjusted life year and 83.9% at €50,000 per quality-adjusted life year. For recurrence avoidance, probabilities were 98.3% and 99.8%, respectively.

LIMITATIONS:

The small sample size may limit generalizability and the ability to detect rare but costly complications. Procedural costs were based on average hospital prices, which is a pragmatic approach but is less detailed than bottom-up costing.

CONCLUSIONS:

In patients with grade III hemorrhoids, hemorrhoidectomy provides better long-term clinical outcomes, including higher quality of life and lower recurrence rates compared to rubber band ligation. However, its cost-effectiveness varies depending on societal willingness-to-pay thresholds. Caution is warranted before discarding it as a first-line treatment solely based on health care costs or limited operating room availability. See Video Abstract.

COSTO-EFECTIVIDAD DE LA LIGADURA CON BANDA ELÁSTICA VERSUS HEMORROIDECTOMÍA PARA EL TRATAMIENTO DE HEMORROIDES DE GRADO III: ANÁLISIS UTILIZANDO EVIDENCIA DEL ENSAYO HOLLAND CONTROLADO ALEATORIZADO

ANTECEDENTES:

Las hemorroides afectan significativamente la calidad de vida y los costos de atención médica. Si bien la ligadura con banda elástica y la hemorroidectomía son tratamientos comunes para las hemorroides de grado III, los datos comparativos de costo-efectividad son limitados.

OBJETIVO:

Evaluar el costo-efectividad y el costo-utilidad de la ligadura con banda elástica en comparación con la hemorroidectomía desde una perspectiva social en el contexto del ensayo HOLLAND.

DISEÑO:

Análisis de costo-efectividad y costo-utilidad utilizando datos de un ensayo controlado aleatorizado multicéntrico.

ESTABLECIMIENTO:

Diez hospitales holandeses participantes en el ensayo HOLLAND.

PACIENTES:

Adultos con hemorroides sintomáticas de grado III aleatorizados a ligadura con banda elástica o hemorroidectomía.

INTERVENCIONES:

Ligadura con banda elástica (hasta dos sesiones) o hemorroidectomía escisional.

PRINCIPALES MEDIDAS DE VALORACIÓN:

Costo por año de vida ajustado a calidad (AVAC) ganado y costo por recurrencia evitada durante 24 meses desde una perspectiva social.

RESULTADOS:

Se analizaron setenta y nueve pacientes (33 hemorroidectomía, 46 ligadura con banda elástica). La hemorroidectomía presentó mejores resultados clínicos, con una diferencia de AVAC de 0,08 (IC del 95%, 0,04–0,13) y una diferencia de recurrencia del 33,5% (IC del 95%, 15,3%-51,7%). Los costes hospitalarios fueron mayores para la hemorroidectomía (1364 €; IC del 95%, 895–1834; p < 0,001), al igual que los costes sociales (1984 €; IC del 95%, -132–4101; p = 0,066). La razón costo-utilidad incremental para la hemorroidectomía fue de 24.042 € por AVAC ganado, y la razón costo-efectividad incremental fue de 5.918 € por recurrencia evitada. La probabilidad de que la hemorroidectomía sea costo-efectiva fue del 45,5% con 20.000 €/AVAC y del 83,9% con 50.000 €/AVAC. Para la prevención de la recurrencia, las probabilidades fueron del 98,3% y del 99,8%, respectivamente.

LIMITACIONES:

El pequeño tamaño de la muestra puede limitar la generalización y la capacidad de detectar complicaciones poco frecuentes pero costosas. Los costos del procedimiento se basaron en los precios hospitalarios promedio, lo cual constituye un enfoque pragmático, aunque menos detallado que el cálculo de costos ascendente.

CONCLUSIONES:

En pacientes con hemorroides de grado III, la hemorroidectomía ofrece mejores resultados clínicos a largo plazo, incluyendo una mayor calidad de vida y menores tasas de recurrencia en comparación con la ligadura con banda elástica. Sin embargo, su costo-efectividad varía en función de los umbrales de disposición a pagar de la sociedad. Se recomienda precaución antes de descartarla como tratamiento de primera línea basándose únicamente en los costos sanitarios o la disponibilidad limitada de quirófanos. (Traducción — Ingrid Melo)

### Comparison of rubber band ligation and hemorrhoidectomy in patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids grade III: a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled noninferiority trial [^1112eiQG]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

Primary outcomes

The primary outcomes included 12-month HR-QoL and recurrence rate:

HR-QoL: the study evaluated the difference in quality-adjusted life years between the randomized groups, derived from the HR-QoL scores measured during a 12-month posttreatment period. HR-QoL was assessed using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, utilizing Dutch wording and population norms (range, –0.446 to 1.0, with 1.0 indicating optimal health). The primary analysis period was adjusted to 12 months due to early termination.
Recurrence rate: recurrence was determined by self-reported symptoms and subsequent procedures within 12 months, excluding repeat RBL sessions. Self-reported symptoms were assessed using a dichotomous question following established methods.

Secondary outcomes

Secondary outcomes included symptom severity (PROM-HISS score 0–5; HSS score 0–15; proctoPROM score 0–50, with 0 being optimum); pain intensity (VAS score 0–10); analgesic use; time to resume work; complications; incontinence (Vaizey score 0–24, with 0 being optimum), persistent symptoms at 6 weeks; need for further treatment; and health-state utility score (EQ-5D-5L). The timing of various assessments is outlined in Supplemental Table 2 at.

Sample Size

The sample size calculation was based on the noninferiority design for HR-QoL. It was hypothesized that both treatment groups would exhibit equal quality-adjusted life years. With a 1-sided alpha value of 0.025, power of 80%, SD of 0.15, and noninferiority limit of 0.05, a total of 142 patients were required per group. To accommodate for stratification by center, this number was increased to 162 patients per group. The surgical procedure was standardized; therefore, a low variability between centers was expected and an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.01 was estimated. The total sample size was 360 patients to adjust for a 10% loss to follow-up. However, 87 patients (24%) were enrolled because of early trial termination.

Baseline Data

Baseline characteristics, including symptoms and scores, were comparable between the groups (Table 1). Procedural data by treatment group are shown in Table 2. In the RBL group, 9 patients (20%) received same-day treatment postrandomization, compared to none in the hemorrhoidectomy group. The median time from randomization to intervention was 11 days (interquartile range [IQR], 5–30) for RBL and 50 days (IQR, 27–88) for hemorrhoidectomy (p < 0.001). Treatments were primarily performed by surgeons. Hemorrhoidectomy was performed under general anesthesia in 94% of cases. In the RBL group, the median number of rubber bands placed was 3 (IQR, 3–4). Additional 1 to 2 cushion hemorrhoidopexy was performed in 15% of cases in the hemorrhoidectomy group.

TABLE 1.
Baseline characteristics of study participants by treatment group

TABLE 2.
Procedural clinical data by treatment group

At 6 weeks, physical clinical assessments were completed for 76% of RBL and 79% of hemorrhoidectomy participants. Telephone assessments were conducted for 15% of RBL and 13% of hemorrhoidectomy participants due to COVID-19 or other reasons. Clinical assessments were not conducted for 6 participants, as detailed in Figure 1.

### Retroflexed endoscopic multiple band ligation of symptomatic internal hemorrhoids [^112jSzN1]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Elastic band ligation is a well-established nonoperative method for treatment of internal hemorrhoids that give rise to symptoms. This study assessed the efficacy and safety of retroflexed endoscopic multiple band ligation, a procedure that involves extensive ligation of internal hemorrhoids, and the immediately proximal normal rectal mucosa, by means of a retroflexed endoscope.

Methods

Eighty-two patients with symptoms caused by internal hemorrhoids (15, stage I; 19, stage II; 47, stage III; 1, stage IV) were treated by retroflexed endoscopic multiple band ligation. Symptoms (prolapse, bleeding, pain with defecation) were graded from 0 to 3. Range and form of the internal hemorrhoids were evaluated endoscopically. Retroflexed endoscopic multiple band ligation was performed by using a flexible endoscope with an attached band ligation device in the retroflexed position.

Results

A mean of 8 bands (range 4–14) were placed per treatment session. Seventy-six patients were treated in a single session, 5 in two sessions, and one in 3 sessions. Symptom and endoscopic scores improved at 4 weeks after the retroflexed endoscopic multiple band ligation: bleeding, from 1.26 to 0.53 (p < 0.01); prolapse, from 1.94 to 0.5 (p < 0.01); pain, from 1.03 to 0.93 (p = 0.67); Goligher classification, from 2.41 to 1.09 (p < 0.01); range, from 3.25 to 0.56 (p < 0.01); and form, from 2.81 to 0.56 (p < 0.01). Long-term response (mean follow-up 12 months, range 3–40 months) was excellent for 89% of the patients, good for 9%, and poor for 2%. No major complication was noted.

Conclusions

Retroflexed endoscopic multiple band ligation is a safe and effective method for treatment for patients with symptoms caused by internal hemorrhoids.

### Comparison of rubber band ligation and hemorrhoidectomy in patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids grade III: a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled noninferiority trial [^116wBVUc]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND:

The optimal management strategy for grade III hemorrhoids remains a subject of ongoing debate. Hemorrhoidectomy is the criterion standard, but rubber band ligation offers a less invasive outpatient alternative. Treatment variability persists due to a lack of consensus on the preferred strategy.

OBJECTIVE:

To directly compare the effectiveness of rubber band ligation and hemorrhoidectomy in the treatment of grade III hemorrhoids.

DESIGN:

Open-label, parallel-group, randomized controlled noninferiority trial.

SETTINGS:

Multicenter study across 10 Dutch hospitals from October 2019 to September 2022.

PATIENTS:

Patients (aged 18 years or older) with symptomatic grade III (Goligher) hemorrhoids were included in this study. Exclusion criteria included prior rectal/anal surgery, more than 1 rubber band ligation/injection within the preceding 3 years, rectal radiation, preexisting sphincter injury, IBD, medical unfitness for surgery (ASA higher than 3), pregnancy, or hypercoagulability disorders.

INTERVENTIONS:

Randomized 1:1 to rubber band ligation or hemorrhoidectomy, with up to 2 banding sessions allowed.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:

Primary outcomes included 12-month health-related quality of life and recurrence rate. Secondary outcomes included complications, pain, work resumption, and patient-reported outcome measures.

RESULTS:

Eighty-seven patients were randomly assigned (47 rubber band ligation vs 40 hemorrhoidectomy). Rubber band ligation was not noninferior to hemorrhoidectomy in quality-adjusted life years (–0.045; 95% CI, –0.087 to –0.004). Recurrence rate was worse in the rubber band ligation group (47.5% vs 6.1%), with an absolute risk difference of 41% (95% CI, 24%–59%). Complication rates were comparable. Pain scores after hemorrhoidectomy were higher during the first week (visual analogue scale 4 vs 1; p = 0.002). Rubber band ligation group returned to work sooner (1 vs 9 days; p = 0.021). Patient-reported hemorrhoidal symptom scores favored hemorrhoidectomy.

LIMITATIONS:

The primary limitation of the study was its early termination due to funding constraints, resulting in a relatively small sample size and limited statistical power. Patient recruitment was hindered by significant treatment preferences and the COVID-19 pandemic.

CONCLUSIONS:

Hemorrhoidectomy may benefit patients with grade III hemorrhoids in terms of quality of life, recurrence risk, and symptom burden, whereas rubber band ligation allows faster recovery with less pain. These findings can guide clinical decision-making. See Video Abstract.

COMPARACIÓN DE LA LIGADURA CON BANDA ELÁSTICA Y LA HEMORROIDECTOMÍA EN PACIENTES CON HEMORROIDES SINTOMÁTICAS GRADO III: ENSAYO MULTICÉNTRICO, ABIERTO, ALEATORIZADO, CONTROLADO Y DE NO INFERIORIDAD

ANTECEDENTES:

La estrategia óptima de tratamiento para las hemorroides grado III sigue siendo un tema de debate continuo. La hemorroidectomía es el estándar de oro, pero la ligadura con banda elástica ofrece una alternativa ambulatoria menos invasiva. La variabilidad del tratamiento persiste debido a la falta de consenso sobre la estrategia preferida.

OBJETIVO:

Comparar directamente la eficacia de la ligadura con banda elástica y la hemorroidectomía en el tratamiento de las hemorroides grado III.

DISEÑO:

Ensayo de no inferioridad, controlado, aleatorizado, de grupos paralelos y abierto.

ENTORNO CLINICO:

Estudio multicéntrico en 10 hospitales holandeses desde octubre de 2019 hasta septiembre de 2022.

PACIENTES:

Pacientes (≥ 18 años) con hemorroides sintomáticas grado III (Goligher). Exclusiones: cirugía rectal/anal previa, > 1 ligadura con banda elástica/inyección en los tres años anteriores, radiación rectal, lesión preexistente del esfínter, enfermedad inflamatoria intestinal, incapacidad médica para la cirugía (ASA > 3), embarazo o trastornos de hipercoagulabilidad.

INTERVENCIONES:

Aleatorización 1:1 para ligadura con banda elástica o hemorroidectomía, con hasta dos sesiones de ligadura permitidas.

PRINCIPALES MEDIDAS DE RESULTADOS:

Primarias: calidad de vida relacionada con la salud a los 12 meses y tasa de recurrencia. Secundarias: complicaciones, dolor, reanudación del trabajo y medidas de resultados informadas por el paciente.

RESULTADOS:

Se aleatorizaron ochenta y siete pacientes (47 ligadura con banda elástica frente a 40 hemorroidectomía). La ligadura con banda elástica no fue no inferior a la hemorroidectomía en años de vida ajustados por calidad (-0,045, intervalo de confianza del 95%: -0,087 a -0,004). La tasa de recurrencia fue peor en el grupo de ligadura con banda elástica (47,5% frente a 6,1%), con una diferencia de riesgo absoluto del 41% (intervalo de confianza del 95%: 24%–59%). Las tasas de complicaciones fueron comparables. Las puntuaciones de dolor posthemorroidectomía fueron más altas durante la primera semana (escala analógica visual 4 frente a 1; p = 0,002). El grupo de ligadura con banda elástica volvió al trabajo antes (1 frente a 9 días; p = 0,021). Las puntuaciones de síntomas hemorroidales notificadas por los pacientes favorecieron a la hemorroidectomía.

LIMITACIONES:

La principal limitación del estudio fue su finalización temprana debido a las limitaciones de financiación, lo que dio lugar a un tamaño de muestra relativamente pequeño y a un poder estadístico limitado. El reclutamiento de pacientes se vio obstaculizado por las preferencias significativas de tratamiento y la pandemia de COVID-19.

CONCLUSIONES:

La hemorroidectomía puede beneficiar a los pacientes con hemorroides de grado III en términos de calidad de vida, riesgo de recurrencia y carga de síntomas, mientras que la ligadura con banda elástica permite una recuperación más rápida con menos dolor. Estos hallazgos pueden orientar la toma de decisiones clínicas. (Traducción — Dr. Francisco M. Abarca-Rendon)

DISCUSSION

The HollAND trial was the first RCT to compare RBL and hemorrhoidectomy for grade III hemorrhoids, assessing both effectiveness and patient perspectives. Results showed that the RBL group did not meet the noninferiority criteria for HR-QoL compared to the hemorrhoidectomy group after 12 months. This may be attributed to the sample size not being reached, potentially limiting analysis power. Although hemorrhoidectomy had higher mean QALY scores, the design limits any conclusion of its superiority over RBL. Nevertheless, the QALY differences suggest hemorrhoidectomy may offer better symptom control and improve QoL more effectively.

At baseline, both groups had similar HR-QoL scores. Although the RBL group reported higher scores shortly after treatment, likely due to greater impact of hemorrhoidectomy on daily life and postoperative pain, hemorrhoidectomy showed greater improvement from 6 weeks onward. By 24 months, both treatments had a positive effect on patients, with no significant difference in long-term HR-QoL.

Discussion

A conservative approach is typically used at the initial stage of hemorrhoids, which includes toilet training, high-fiber nutrition, and topical and pharmacological treatments (e.g. laxatives, venotropics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and non-opioid analgesics). When conservative treatment fails, interventional treatment methods are used. Grade III and IV hemorrhoids are a more serious anal and rectal disease in the later stage of hemorrhoid development, accompanied mainly by external hemorrhoids (skin tags) forming mixed hemorrhoids, which have a significant impact on the patient's life and work. When conservative treatment is ineffective, they generally require surgical treatment.

Currently, there are numerous surgical procedures for hemorrhoids, including hemorrhoidectomy, stapled hemorrhoidectomy, and Doppler-guided hemorrhoid art alignment (DG-HAL)/transanal hemorrhoid dearterialization (THD). Among them, hemorrhoidectomy is the most widely used and recommended surgical technique for grade III and IV hemorrhoids by the guidelines from multiple countries. The aim of hemorrhoidectomy is to ligate the vascular pedicles and excise the enlarged hemorrhoidal tissue both above and below the dentate line. Depending on the surgical wound treatment techniques, the most famous representative surgical methods are open hemorrhoidectomy (Milligan–Morgan procedure) and closed hemorrhoidectomy (Ferguson procedure). MMH is a surgical procedure based on the theory of "varicose veins" with definite efficacy, especially for high-grade hemorrhoids (grade III/IV), which has been confirmed by numerous randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews. Although DG-HAL/THD is minimally invasive and can reduce postoperative pain, bleeding, and complications, the long-term recurrence rate may be very high. Altomare DF et al. evaluated the changes in the treatment of 32,458 hemorrhoid patients in Italy over the last 17 years and found that the proportion of MMH has remained between 65 and 70% and that MMH remains the most frequently performed procedure for grade III hemorrhoids. However, hemorrhoidectomy has some disadvantages, which may be related to early and late complications, such as postoperative pain, urinary retention, long recovery period, delayed bleeding, anal stenosis, and fecal incontinence. Banding and sclerotherapy are commonly used clinical procedures for the treatment of grade I–II and selective grade III hemorrhoids. RBL has the advantages of being quick, relatively painless, and generally well tolerated due to its application in an area lacking somatic sensitivity (at the base of the hemorrhoids above the dentate line). However, RBL has shown variable success rates and a considerable risk of recurrence, which may require further intervention. The common complications of RBL technology include pain, bleeding, and thrombosis. Still, there are some rare but serious complications, such as liver abscess, massive secondary rectal hemorrhage, perineal septicemia, and death. Polidocanol, a detergent-type sclerosant and local anesthetic, is one of the emerging sclerosant agents for the treatment of hemorrhoids. The apparent advantage of polidocanol foam is that it increases the proportion of active drugs on endothelial cells, resulting in uniform distribution of drug microbubbles, higher adhesion to the endothelium, and greater hardening ability. Moser KH et al. evaluated the efficacy and safety of polidocanol foam compared with liquid polidocanol for the treatment of hemorrhoids, and the results showed that polidocanol foam was more effective than liquid polidocanol and that patients had higher satisfaction with equivalent safety. Polidocanol is well tolerated locally and has a low incidence of systemic reactions, but clinicians should know about the possibility of uncommon but life-threatening adverse reactions, such as severe anaphylactic reactions and cardiac arrest. Currently, the concentration of polidocanol used for treating hemorrhoids in clinical practice is not standardized, with commonly used concentrations ranging from 1 to 3%. In our study, a low concentration of 1% polidocanol was injected into each ligated nodule to avoid potential side effects and ensure patient safety.

### Rubber band ligation of hemorrhoids: is the procedure effective for the immunocompromised, hemophiliacs and pregnant women? [^1112MPeU]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

The number of bands used varies in the literature from 2 or 3 to 6 bands per session, while Fukuda et al proposed, in a case series, a mean of 8 bands (range 4–14] placed per treatment session by retroflexed endoscopic vision, in order to reduce the number of sessions required. As we always placed a maximum of 4 bands/session, to avoid strictures, repeated sessions were required, particularly in hemophiliac patients (up to 6 vs. 4 in controls). The success rate of RBL ranged between 79% and 91.8%, while repeated banding sessions showed an efficacy of up to 94%. In our series, all patients experienced successful eradication and remained asymptomatic for at least the 1-year follow up.

Several limitations could be attributed to our study. First and foremost, despite meticulous data collection and all attempts to eliminate bias, it remains a retrospective study. Second, we may have missed cases of asymptomatic recurrence that was not causing the patient any discomfort, as a significant part of the follow up was conducted over the phone, so no physical examination took place. Third, there may have been patients who developed later recurrences (after the 1-year follow-up period) and who, for whatever reason, chose either to manage their condition conservatively or to be further treated elsewhere.

In conclusion, the present retrospective analysis of 3 distinct patient categories, hemophiliacs, HIV-positive patients and pregnant women, revealed that RBL is a safe and effective procedure with low complication rates for grade I-III hemorrhoids for these patients. It is thus highly recommended as a management plan in high-risk patients not suitable or unwilling to undergo surgical intervention.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Rubber band ligation (RBL) is considered the most effective, painless, non-surgical option for the treatment of grade I-III hemorrhoids, easily performed on an outpatient basis

### Cost-effectiveness of rubber band ligation versus hemorrhoidectomy for the treatment of grade III hemorrhoids: analysis using evidence from the HOLLAND randomized controlled trial [^112hgRt1]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 1.
Cost-effectiveness plane showing the societal cost differences between RBL and hemorrhoidectomy vs the difference in cost per QALYs. Of note, 97.2% of the dots from the bootstrap samples are situated in the upper right quadrant. QALY = quality-adjusted life year; RBL = rubber band ligation.

Figure 2 presents the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve, illustrating the probability that hemorrhoidectomy is more cost-effective than 2× RBL at varying willingness-to-pay thresholds per QALY gained. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of €20,000 per QALY, the probability of cost-effectiveness for hemorrhoidectomy was 45.5%, whereas at a threshold of €50,000 per QALY, this probability increased to 83.9%. The more society is willing to pay per extra QALY, the more acceptable hemorrhoidectomy becomes as the more expensive strategy.

FIGURE 2.
Cost-effectiveness acceptability curve showing the probability that hemorrhoidectomy is cost-effective vs willingness to pay per cost per QALY. The blue line corresponds to the societal perspective, and the red line corresponds to to the health care perspective. QALY = quality-adjusted life year.

The point-estimated ICER was €5918 (95% BCa CI, 719–22,566) per recurrence avoided from a societal perspective in the base-case scenario. Figure 3 illustrates the cost-effectiveness plane, showing the mean societal costs against the number of prevented recurrences in the RBL group compared to the hemorrhoidectomy group, based on 1000 bootstrap simulations. The majority (97.6%) of the bootstraps fell within the upper-right quadrant, indicating that hemorrhoidectomy is more expensive but again more effective than RBL.

### Pathophysiology of internal hemorrhoids [^114PFx4W]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hemorrhoidal disease is a fairly common and debilitating clinical entity. Despite centuries' of attempts to shed light on its pathophysiology, to cure those affected and to improve sufferers' quality of life, many aspects of the disease remain elusive. Individual beliefs and historical legends, accompanied by undocumented theories, have established and perpetuated the confusion regarding the mechanisms leading to the development of the disease and the rules governing its treatment. Hemorrhoids are classified as internal or external and are viewed as a disease when they become symptomatic. Returning to basic medical sciences, this mini-review focuses on internal hemorrhoids and aims to define the histology and anatomy of the normal and abnormal internal hemorrhoidal plexus and to encourage clinicians to comprehend the pathophysiology of the disease. If doctors can understand the pathophysiology of hemorrhoidal disease, they will be able to clarify the nature of the associated symptoms and complications and to make the correct therapeutic decision.

### Hemorrhoidectomy for thrombosed external hemorrhoids [^114oBmgs]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

External hemorrhoids represent distended vascular tissue in the anal canal distal to the dentate line. Persons with thrombosed external hemorrhoids usually present with pain on standing, sitting or defecating. Acutely tender, thrombosed external hemorrhoids can be surgically removed if encountered within the first 72 hours after onset. Hemorrhoidectomy is performed through an elliptic incision over the site of thrombosis with removal of the entire diseased hemorrhoidal plexus in one piece. Caution must be exercised to avoid cutting into the muscle sphincter below the hemorrhoidal vessels. Infection after suture closure is rare secondary to the rich vascular network in the anal area. Stool softeners must be prescribed postoperatively to help prevent tearing at the suture line. Training and experience in general and skin surgery are necessary before the physician attempts this procedure unsupervised.

### Comparison of rubber band ligation and hemorrhoidectomy in patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids grade III: a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled noninferiority trial [^115ndFjG]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). Medium credibility.

Recurrence rates at 12 months were notably higher after RBL than after hemorrhoidectomy (48.8% vs 6.1%), with the RBL group showing worse outcomes in self-reported recurrence rates (24% vs 0%) and the need for further treatment (24% vs 3%). Consequently, hemorrhoidectomy appears more effective clinically. However, within our study design constraints, we can only assert that RBL is not noninferior.

We used the dichotomous self-reporting method developed by Shanmugam et al. – Because posttreatment physical examinations often fail to fully capture patient symptoms, self-reported outcomes add to a more comprehensive measure of treatment success. In the present study, 54% of RBL patients required further treatment, with 28% undergoing a second banding as permitted by protocol, reflecting the common practice of repeated RBL for grade III hemorrhoids. Among these patients, 42% reported recurrence at 12 months, highlighting that solely tracking reoperations is not sufficient. This is consistent with the Hubble trial, which reported a 49% recurrence rate for grade II–III hemorrhoids after 1 year. In addition, although self-reported recurrence might be influenced by the lack of blinding because patients who are aware of their less invasive treatment might be more inclined to report symptoms, our findings highlight the importance of including self-reported data alongside reoperations for a comprehensive long-time follow-up. The post hoc analysis in the Hubble trial further demonstrated that reclassification of repeated banding in the RBL group significantly reduced recurrence rates from 49% to 37.5%, underscoring the need to compare repeated RBL with hemorrhoidectomy.

### Long-term outcome of rubber band ligation for symptomatic primary and recurrent internal hemorrhoids [^11134Jwd]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

Rubber band ligation therapy for symptomatic hemorrhoidal disease has been used for many years and is a well-accepted treatment modality, but information on long-term outcome is limited. Our goals were to determine safety and long-term efficacy of this treatment.

Methods

A retrospective chart review of patients undergoing rubber band ligatures for symptomatic internal hemorrhoids in a single practice was conducted. Information on presenting symptoms, number of bands applied, response to therapy, complications encountered, length of follow-up, interval to recurrent symptoms when applicable, and subsequent therapy were documented. Supplemental information was obtained from telephone follow-up. Outcome was categorized as success or failure, in which success was defined as: permanent relief of symptoms for follow-up period; marked improvement in symptomatology with rare manifestation of bleeding (≤ 1/month); symptom relief for a limited period of time (≥ 100 days), and failure was defined as: modest improvement (decreased but not relief of symptoms); or no improvement in symptoms.

Results

A total of 805 patients underwent 2,114 rubber band ligatures. Most common presenting symptoms were bleeding in 731 patients (90.8 percent) and prolapsing in 382 patients (47.5 percent). The median number of bands placed was two (range, 1–17). The median time between bandings was 4.7 (range, 1.1–35.6) weeks. Median follow-up time was 1,204 (range, 14–9,571) days. Excluding 104 patients lost to follow-up (never returned after initial treatment), success was obtained in 70.5 percent (494/701) and failure in 29.5 percent (207/701) of patients. Success rates were similar for all degrees of hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoidal disease requiring the placement of four or more bands was associated with a trend in higher failure rates and greater need for subsequent hemorrhoidectomy. Complications per treatment series included bleeding (2.8 percent), thrombosed external hemorrhoids (1.5 percent), and bacteremia (0.09 percent). Higher bleeding rates were encountered with the use of acetylsalicylic acid/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and warfarin. Time to recurrence was less with subsequent treatment courses. Treatment of recurrent symptoms with rubber band ligation resulted in success rates of 73.6, 61.4, and 65 percent for first, second, and third recurrences respectively. This resulted in a cumulative success rate of 80.2 percent for this method of treatment.

Conclusions

Rubber band ligatures are safe and effective therapy for symptomatic internal hemorrhoids. It can be used to treat all degrees of hemorrhoids with similar effectiveness. The likelihood of success is lower if more than four bands are needed to eliminate symptoms. The use of acetylsalicylic acid/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and warfarin is associated with higher bleeding rates. Rubber band ligatures for recurrence of symptoms is effective; however, time to recurrence is less with subsequent treatments.

### Cost-effectiveness of rubber band ligation versus hemorrhoidectomy for the treatment of grade III hemorrhoids: analysis using evidence from the HOLLAND randomized controlled trial [^1164AUxP]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hemorrhoids significantly impact quality of life and healthcare costs. While rubber band ligation and hemorrhoidectomy are common treatments for grade III hemorrhoids, comparative cost-effectiveness data are limited.

Objective

To assess the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of rubber band ligation compared to hemorrhoidectomy from a societal perspective within the context of the HOLLAND trial.

Design

Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses using data from a multicenter, randomized controlled trial.

Settings

Ten Dutch hospitals participating in the HOLLAND trial.

Patients

Adults with symptomatic grade III hemorrhoids randomized to rubber band ligation or hemorrhoidectomy.

Interventions

Rubber band ligation (up to two sessions) or excisional hemorrhoidectomy.

Main Outcome Measures

Cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained and cost per recurrence avoided over 24 months from a societal perspective.

Results

Seventy-nine patients were analyzed (33 hemorrhoidectomy, 46 rubber band ligation). Hemorrhoidectomy resulted in better clinical outcomes with a QALY difference of 0.08 (95% CI, 0.04–0.13) and a recurrence difference of 33.5% (95% CI, 15.3%-51.7%). Hospital costs were higher for hemorrhoidectomy (€1,364; 95% CI, 895–1,834; p < 0.001), as were societal costs (€1,984; 95% CI, -132–4,101; p = 0.066). The incremental cost-utility ratio for hemorrhoidectomy was €24,042 per QALY gained, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was €5,918 per recurrence avoided. The probability of hemorrhoidectomy being cost-effective was 45.5% at €20,000/QALY and 83.9% at €50,000/QALY. For recurrence avoidance, probabilities were 98.3% and 99.8%, respectively.

Limitations

The small sample size may limit generalizability and the ability to detect rare but costly complications. Procedural costs were based on average hospital prices, which is a pragmatic approach, though less detailed than bottom-up costing.

Conclusions

In patients with grade III hemorrhoids, hemorrhoidectomy provides better long-term clinical outcomes, including higher quality of life and lower recurrence rates compared to rubber band ligation. However, its cost-effectiveness varies depending on societal willingness-to-pay thresholds. Caution is warranted before discarding it as a first-line treatment based solely on healthcare costs or limited operating room availability. See Video Abstract. Clinical Trial Registration Number: NCT04621695.

### Rubber band ligation of hemorrhoids: is the procedure effective for the immunocompromised, hemophiliacs and pregnant women? [^116LqZmQ]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Rubber band ligation (RBL) is an effective, well-established, non-surgical option for symptomatic grade II-III hemorrhoid treatment. However, few reports exist about the benefit and risks of RBL in high-risk patients. We herein evaluated the effectiveness and safety of RBL in hemophiliac, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive and pregnant patients vs. other patients.

Methods

We retrospectively evaluated the effectiveness of RBL, during the period 2001–2021, in 3 distinct patient categories deemed high-risk and thus not suitable for anesthesia and/or surgical management of their hemorrhoids: hemophiliacs, HIV-positive patients, and pregnant women. These were compared to matched controls, selected from our outpatient pool, who had no major comorbidities and who had opted for RBL as the primary method of treatment.

Results

There were 3 study groups (44 with hemophilia, 29 HIV-positive patients, and 45 pregnant women) and controls respectively matched for grade, sex and age (2 for each one in the study groups). Hemophilia patients needed up to 6 RBL sessions for relief of symptoms (3.22 sessions/patient) compared to controls, who needed up to 4 sessions (1.88 sessions/patient, P < 0.001); in the other 2 groups there was no difference. There were 3 minor complications: one minor bleeding in a hemophilia patient, a thrombosis in an HIV-positive patient, and severe rectal pain in a control patient. Patients were followed-up for at least 1 year.

Conclusion

RBL is a safe and effective procedure in hemophiliacs, HIV-positive patients and pregnant women, with low complication rates for grade I-III hemorrhoids, similar to those in healthy matched controls.

### Treatment of uncomplicated hemorrhoids with a hemor-rite® cryotherapy device: a randomized, prospective, comparative study [^115Lmb9Y]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

To promote better understanding of hemorrhoidal disease, the Coloproctology Unit of the Gastroenterology Department, Hospital General de México, classifies hemorrhoids as internal or external. Patients usually have a combination of both types; only a minority of patients has only one type. Internal hemorrhoids are considered arbitrarily as small, medium, or large, and are covered by skin. They are located at the lower end of the rectum, are covered by mucosa, and are clinically graded. Grade I hemorrhoids are those that bleed. Grade II hemorrhoids are those that bleed and extend throughout the anal canal, but do not project outside the canal, and spontaneously retract. Grade III are hemorrhoids that bleed and prolapse outside the anus during defecation and retract spontaneously or require manual retraction. Finally, grade IV hemorrhoids are those that bleed and are permanently prolapsed.

Current treatment for hemorrhoidal disease should be tailored individually for each case; possible treatments are medical, nonsurgical alternative, and surgical treatment. Medical treatment should be used on all patients with hemorrhoidal symptoms, but especially in patients with Grade I or II hemorrhoidal disease, treatment is based on regularizing bowel habits. To do this, the patient should be instructed on the type of diet to follow, primarily a diet rich in fiber, free of irritants, and with an adequate amount of fluids. In a small number of cases, hydrophilic agents such as seeds of psyllium plantago, among other seeds, may be added.–Whereas ointments or suppositories to treat hemorrhoidal disease are somewhat useful, most provide only symptomatic treatment but not a long-term solution. The classic treatment for this disease has been surgical, but postoperative pain, hospital cost, time away from work, and patient reluctance have led to the creation of procedures that avoid these drawbacks. Nonsurgical alternatives for hemorrhoidal disease include elastic band hemorrhoid ligation, sclerotherapy, cryotherapy, bipolar coagulation (BICAP; Circon-Acmi, Stamford, CT, USA), galvanic current (Ultroid®, Vascular Technologies, Inc, Tampa, FL, USA), and photocoagulation with infrared radiation.–

### Rectal artery embolization for hemorrhoidal disease: anatomy, evaluation, and treatment techniques [^114YDg6B]. Radiographics (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic hemorrhoidal disease is a common anorectal condition that leads to hemorrhoidal hyperplasia, which affects millions of people worldwide and is a significant medical and socioeconomic issue. Rectal bleeding is one of the main chronic symptoms. Recurrent rectal bleeding can alter an individual's quality of life and, more rarely, cause anemia. Pain is less common, occurring only in the event of complications such as congestive exacerbation, external hemorrhoidal thrombosis, or fissures. The most standard treatment involves dietary and hygiene measures, use of phlebotonic drugs, and nonsurgical treatment such as infrared photocoagulation or elastic band ligation. Excisional treatments such as hemorrhoidectomy and hemorrhoidopexy are the reference standards for treatment of hemorrhoidal disease. Embolization of the rectal arteries (ie, emborrhoid) has recently emerged as an effective treatment option, with few reported adverse effects, minimal blood loss, and a same-day hospital procedure. Hemorrhoid embolization is performed by using femoral or radial access. The inferior mesenteric artery and then the superior rectal arteries are catheterized with a microcatheter. Embolization can be performed by using different agents. Studies have shown improvement in symptoms and high technical success rates after treatment. The basic principles of hemorrhoid embolization that must be understood to achieve effective treatment, including those related to patient evaluation, the arterial anatomy, basic embolization, and published results, are reviewed.

Rubber band ligation

Rubber band ligation is the most commonly performed office procedure for bleeding grade II and III hemorrhoids. During this procedure, a rubber band is placed around a hemorrhoidal column, causing tissue necrosis and fixation to the mucosa. Necrosis usually occurs in 3–5 days, followed by ulceration and healing in several weeks. Rubber band ligation cannot be performed on external hemorrhoids because of their somatic innervation. Other contraindications include patients on anticoagulation or with a coagulopathy, as there is a risk of significant bleeding. The procedure is done in office, with the patient in a jackknife prone position and without anesthesia. An anoscope is used to visualize the hemorrhoids, and rubber bands are deployed at least half a centimeter above the dentate line. It is important to confirm that there is no pain before and after placement. Common complications include pain, urinary retention, delayed bleeding, and perineal sepsis. A retrospective review of 805 patients and 2114 rubber band ligations found an overall success rate of 80%, with complications such as bleeding (2.8%), thrombosis of external hemorrhoid (1.5%) and bacteremia (0.09%).

Sclerotherapy

Sclerotherapy is another office-based procedure for treating internal grade I and II hemorrhoids. This is an especially good treatment for those on anticoagulation or with coagulopathy. Similarly to rubber band ligation, the procedure is performed with an anoscope and without anesthesia to visualize the hemorrhoids and inject them with a sclerosant, such as 5% phenol in vegetable oil, ethanolamine, quinine or hypertonic saline. This causes fibrosis and fixation of the tissue to the anal canal, effectively obliterating the redundant hemorrhoidal tissue.

Infrared coagulation is a variation of sclerotherapy where hemorrhoids are sclerosed using an infrared coagulator. The procedure is performed similarly, but instead of sclerosant, an infrared coagulator is applied to the base of the hemorrhoids for 2 sec, 3–5 times, until white blanched mucosa is seen, eventually causing scaring and retraction of the prolapsed mucosa.

A meta-analysis of 18 trials comparing rubber band ligation and sclerotherapy showed that rubber band ligation had a better cure rates for grade I-III hemorrhoids, with no difference in complication rates. Rubber band ligation tended to cause more pain initially, but was less likely to be followed by recurrence of symptoms. Infrared coagulation and sclerotherapy were more likely to require additional procedures compared to rubber band ligation.

ASCRS hemorrhoids guideline — statement of the problem describes hemorrhoids as vascular structures that arise from a channel of arteriovenous connective tissues and drain into the superior and inferior hemorrhoidal veins; they are categorized as external or internal based on their relationship with the dentate line, communicate with one another, and often coexist. Symptoms related to hemorrhoids are very common in the Western hemisphere and other industrialized societies, and hemorrhoidal disease represents one of the most common medical and surgical disease processes encountered in the United States, resulting in more than 2.2 million outpatient evaluations per year. Many diverse symptoms may be, correctly or incorrectly, attributed to hemorrhoids by both patients and referring physicians.

### Efficacy of two endoscopic rubber band ligation methods for symptomatic hemorrhoids: a randomized controlled trial [^114XDzQS]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Endoscopic rubber band ligation (ERBL) is considered an effective nonsurgical treatment for symptomatic grade I to III hemorrhoids; however, it is unclear whether ligation of hemorrhoids or simultaneous ligation of hemorrhoids and proximal normal mucosa (combined ligation) is safer and more effective. This controlled, open-label, and prospective study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of both methods for symptomatic grade I to III hemorrhoids.

Methods

Seventy patients with symptomatic grade I to III hemorrhoids were randomly assigned to the hemorrhoid and combined ligation groups (35 in each group). Patients were followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months to assess symptom improvement, complications, and recurrence. The primary outcome was overall therapeutic success rate (complete resolution and partial resolution rates). The secondary outcomes included recurrence rate and efficacy for each symptom. Complications and patient satisfaction were also assessed.

Results

Sixty-two patients (31 in each group) completed the 12-month follow-up; 42 (67.8%) experienced complete resolution, 17 (27.4%) experienced partial resolution, and 3 (4.8%) experienced no change in overall efficacy. The rates of complete resolution, partial resolution, and no change in the hemorrhoid ligation and combined ligation groups were 71.0 and 64.5%, 22.6 and 32.3%, and 6.5 and 3.2%, respectively. No significant differences in overall efficacy, recurrence rate, or efficacy for each symptom (including bleeding, prolapse, pain, anal swelling, itching, soiling, and constipation) were observed between groups. No life-threatening events requiring surgical intervention occurred. The incidence of postoperative pain was higher in the combined ligation group (74.2% vs. 45.2%, P = 0.02). No significant differences between groups in terms of incidences of other complications or patient satisfaction were observed.

Conclusion

Both methods achieved satisfactory therapeutic effects. No significant differences in efficacy and safety of the two ligation methods were observed; however, combined ligation resulted in a higher incidence of postprocedural pain.

Recurrence Rate

At 12 months, recurrence was observed in 48.8% of RBL participants versus 6.1% in the hemorrhoidectomy group, with an absolute risk difference (ARD) of 43% (95% CI, 25%–60%; p < 0.001), exceeding the noninferiority limit of 10% (Table 4). Self-reported recurrence was higher in the RBL group (24%) compared to none in the hemorrhoidectomy group (ARD 24%; 95% CI, 10%–37%; p = 0.003). In addition, 26% of RBL participants required more than 1 additional treatment, compared to 3% in the hemorrhoidectomy group (ARD 23%; 95% CI, 9%–37%; p = 0.006). Specifically, 3 RBL participants (6.5%) underwent multiple RBL sessions (3×, 3×, and 6×), 3 participants (6.5%) underwent 1 extra RBL session followed by hemorrhoidectomy, and 6 participants (13%) underwent immediate hemorrhoidectomy after initial RBL failure. Thirteen RBL participants (28%) underwent 1 repeated RBL session, as was allowed by the study protocol (see Supplemental Table 3 at).

TABLE 4.
Recurrence rate at 12 mo

At 6 weeks, 26% of RBL participants and 4.5% of hemorrhoidectomy participants reported unchanged or worsened symptoms (ARD 22%; 95% CI, 2%–42%). At 6 months, these rates were 7.9% versus 3% (ARD 5%; 95% CI, –5% to +15%). At 24 months, self-reported recurrence was 29.7% in the RBL group versus 6.7% in the hemorrhoidectomy group (ARD 23%; 95% CI, 6%–40%; see Supplemental Table 4 at).

Complications

Postoperative complications were observed in 6% of patients in the RBL group and 12% of patients in the hemorrhoidectomy group (Table 2), with similar rates of serious adverse events. Incontinence scores improved by about 1 unit in both groups, with no significant differences during follow-up (see Supplemental Table 5 at).

### ACG clinical guidelines: management of benign anorectal disorders [^113Lu5Sw]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Hemorrhoids — diagnostic assessment and grading — gastroenterologists and other providers should diagnose hemorrhoids by history and physical examination, and if there is bleeding, the source often requires confirmation by endoscopic studies (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). Physical examination should include visual inspection of the anus, both at rest and while straining, and digital examination for other anal pathology, and internal hemorrhoids can be assigned a functional grade based on their history: first-degree hemorrhoids do not prolapse, second-degree hemorrhoids prolapse but self-reduce, third-degree hemorrhoids protrude and require manual reduction, and fourth-degree hemorrhoids protrude and cannot be reduced. Laboratory testing is almost never helpful, and the clinical diagnosis of hemorrhoids usually includes hemorrhoid-pattern bleeding that mandates at least sigmoidoscopy to rule out other sources of bleeding; in patients over the age of 50 years or with a suggestive family history, this may be the occasion for evaluation of the entire colon, usually by colonoscopy. Hemorrhoids without symptoms are not diagnosed by flexible endoscopy, and a thrombosed external hemorrhoid is easily recognized on physical examination as a usually tender blue lump at the anal verge, and no other workup or classification is needed.

### Cost-effectiveness of rubber band ligation versus hemorrhoidectomy for the treatment of grade III hemorrhoids: analysis using evidence from the HOLLAND randomized controlled trial [^116zzXbt]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). Medium credibility.

Hemorrhoidal disease is a common condition and significantly impacts quality of life and health care costs. – Treatment decisions are often guided by the Goligher classification, with surgical intervention typically recommended when conservative measures fail. – However, for grade III hemorrhoids, there is no consensus on the optimal treatment strategy, leading to variability in clinical practice.

Two common treatment options are rubber band ligation (RBL), a minimally invasive outpatient procedure with relatively low upfront costs, and hemorrhoidectomy, the current criterion standard, which is more invasive and costly but generally provides more durable symptom relief. Although RBL is frequently chosen as a first-line treatment, repeat procedures are often required, raising concerns about cumulative costs and the prolonged impact on quality of life. – These additional costs result not only from additional health care resources but also from indirect costs, such as productivity losses due to prolonged treatment durations and recovery periods.

This variability underscores the need to assess not only clinical outcomes but also economic implications. With rising health care expenses, cost-effectiveness has become a critical consideration in managing hemorrhoidal disease. Logically, recent studies have begun to investigate the cost-effectiveness of various surgical procedures. – However, despite these findings, direct health-economic comparisons of RBL and hemorrhoidectomy for grade III hemorrhoids are limited. One retrospective study favored repeated banding over hemorrhoidectomy, estimating an average cost of $723 per patient, but it included a heterogeneous cohort and excluded key societal costs.

The HOLLAND trial highlighted important differences between these treatment strategies, showing lower quality-of-life scores and higher recurrence rates for RBL compared to hemorrhoidectomy. Given the higher costs and longer recovery of hemorrhoidectomy, further economic evaluation is warranted. The present study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness (cost per recurrence avoided) and cost-utility (cost per quality-adjusted life year [QALY] gained) of RBL compared to hemorrhoidectomy for grade III hemorrhoids during a 2-year period from a societal perspective.

### Milligan-morgan hemorrhoidectomy combined with rubber band ligation and polidocanol foam sclerotherapy for the management of grade III / IV hemorrhoids: a retrospective study [^111jby8J]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

The most widely used classification of hemorrhoids is the Goligher classification, and treatment options include basic treatment, outpatient procedures, and surgical treatment, depending primarily on the severity of the hemorrhoids. Banding and sclerotherapy are commonly used clinic-based procedures and are primarily applicable to patients with grade I and II and selective patients with grade III internal hemorrhoidal disease who fail medical treatment. Rubber band ligation (RBL) is the most popular and effective treatment in clinic-based procedures, as it causes ischemia and necrosis of prolapsed mucosa after ligating hemorrhoid tissue and then forms scar fixation on the rectal wall. This technique is ligated above the dentate line, without somatic nerve branches, and causes less pain. Sclerotherapy leads to inflammation and fibrosis of the hemorrhoid tissue with scarring, followed by mucosal fixation in the submucosa. Polidocanol has recently started to be employed in the treatment of hemorrhoids in liquid or foam form and is associated with lower bleeding rates and post-procedural pain. These procedures are all relatively well tolerated, with high patient satisfaction and less pain and discomfort, but they all have a certain recurrence rate and may require repeated applications. Hemorrhoidectomy is the gold standard and first choice in surgical therapy for patients with grade III/IV hemorrhoids, and a Milligan–Morgan hemorrhoidectomy (MMH) is one of the most commonly used surgical techniques because of its evident efficacy and high success rate. However, it is often associated with complications, such as postoperative pain, delayed bleeding, and delayed wound healing. Therefore, none of the surgical methods currently used could be considered a completely painless and safe ideal surgical option. Pata F et al. reported sclerobanding (combining RBL with 3% polidocanol foam sclerotherapy) to treat second–and third–degree hemorrhoids, and indicating that sclerbanding was a safe technique with a low rate of postoperative complications. However, high-grade hemorrhoids (especially grade IV) are often accompanied by external hemorrhoids, this technique may not be applicable, and hemorrhoidectomy is recommended.

### The role of endoscopy in patients with anorectal disorders [^115wUsDW]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2010). Medium credibility.

Internal hemorrhoids — procedural cautions, banding limits, and indications are outlined. Experts caution against RBL of internal hemorrhoids in sedated patients because significant pain from errant bands near or below the dentate line can occur. Usually, no more than 3 hemorrhoidal groups are banded in 1 session, and some experts advocate placing only 1 band at a time. Hemorrhoidal disease requiring 4 or more bands was associated with higher failure and greater need for operative hemorrhoidectomy. Surgical treatments are the treatments of choice for fourth-degree, strangulated, or refractory hemorrhoids, whereas RBL is the treatment of choice for mild rectal mucosal prolapse and bleeding in first-, second-, and selected third-degree hemorrhoids when medical treatments fail; surgery should be reserved for very large third- and fourth-degree hemorrhoids or when RBL fails.

### Rubber band ligation of hemorrhoids: is the procedure effective for the immunocompromised, hemophiliacs and pregnant women? [^114ZkvKM]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

RBL as a treatment for internal hemorrhoids was first proposed by Bleisdell in 1958 and then adjusted to its current form by Barron in 1963, to gradually replace the painful injection sclerotherapy. Since then, it has been established as a minimally invasive, painless, easily performed in-office, as well as cost-effective treatment modality for grade I-III piles, aimed at achieving resection of hemorrhoidal tissue with simultaneous fixation of the mucosa and correction of the prolapse.

The present study was based on data from a cohort of patients suffering from hemorrhoidal disease, treated with RBL in our department. The aim was to retrospectively assess the effectiveness and the risks of the procedure by analyzing the number of banding sessions needed and the complications that arose in 3 distinct study groups, i.e. hemophiliacs, HIV-positive patients and pregnant women, in relation to matched comparison groups. The patients in the study groups were deemed high-risk to receive general anesthesia (such as pregnant women) and/or surgical management of their hemorrhoids, or they refused to undergo general anesthesia because of their underlying diseases. From the same cohort of outpatients, 2 control subjects who had opted for RBL as a primary method of treatment, and who had no major comorbidities, were matched to each study group member according to disease severity (grade), sex, and age.

Hemophiliac patients were found to need almost twice the number of sessions (up to 6 sessions, mean 3.22) compared to the matched comparison group (up to 4 sessions, mean 1.81) for complete resolution of symptoms; this being mainly attributable to bleeding tendency, as a consequence of the impaired hemostasis mechanism, but also to the risk of secondary bleeding when the hemorrhoidal mucosa sloughed off at 7–14 days post-banding, leaving an ulcer with a blood vessel at its base. To the best of our knowledge, there is no bibliography for such coagulation disorders, but only a small number of articles on patients receiving anticoagulants, for whom treatment cessation is generally recommended. In a retrospective review of 364 patients undergoing RBL while on antithrombotic therapy, the authors reported only 6 severe bleedings requiring transfusion of blood products; if clopidogrel was not included, the risk of bleeding would be less than 0.5%. In our series, we experienced only one case of minor bleeding, not requiring transfusion.

### Pathophysiology of internal hemorrhoids [^117RPTR4]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Surgically valuable correlations

The principle of the "rubber-band ligation" technique is to band the mucosa and the submucosa of the anal cushion. Banding generates inflammation, with ultimate ischemia and necrosis of the banded part. Apart from removing the nodule, the final sequela of the procedure is the fibrosis generated: it fixes the remaining tissue in the underlying tissue of the surgical anal canal and corrects the prolapse. It is considered the mainstay of therapy for hemorrhoids grade I and II and of selected patients with grade III. Several trials have proven that this minimally invasive therapeutic procedure is efficient, reliable and safe for hemorrhoidal patients.
The modified (Ferguson) excision hemorrhoidectomy is currently the commonest type of hemorrhoidectomy. In this operation, both the prolapsed sinusoidal tissue and the hypertrophied connective tissue are removed, whereas the anoderm is preserved, the internal sphincter is protected and the sliding process, the fundamental pathophysiologic feature of hemorrhoids, is totally inverted.
The rationale of stapled hemorrhoidopexy is the fact that both the loose mucosa and the enlarged hemorrhoidal nodules above the dentate line contribute to the prolapse of internal hemorrhoids. This operation is not a hemorrhoidectomy. Instead, a circular device excises a ring of redundant mucosa and fixes the hemorrhoidal plexus above the dentate line. During this operation, 3 critical nodes in the pathogenesis of hemorrhoids are targeted: first, prolapse is restored; second, the volume of the hemorrhoidal nodules is significantly reduced; and third, the vessels supplying the internal hemorrhoidal plexus are ligated, limiting the blood supply to the nodules.
Doppler-guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation offers a tailored, individualized therapy, since it locates the feeding terminal branch of the SRA that supplies each hemorrhoidal nodule, ultimately performing targeted suture ligation. Consequently, the increased blood supply to the anal cushion is diminished, its engorgement is prevented, its size is decreased and it is ultimately firmly fixed to the floor of the upper surgical anal canal. This alternative operational technique has been proven to relieve patients' symptoms, with only minor complications and rare relapses.

### Comparison of rubber band ligation and hemorrhoidectomy in patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids grade III: a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled noninferiority trial [^113YCwf3]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Participant Flow and Recruitment

A consolidated standards of reporting trials flow diagram illustrates the participant flow through the study (Fig. 1). Between October 8, 2019, and September 22, 2022, 388 patients were screened. Of these, 216 declined participation due to treatment preference (75% RBL:25% hemorrhoidectomy). Eighty-seven patients consented and were randomly assigned to RBL (n = 47) or hemorrhoidectomy (n = 40). Six withdrew pretreatment after symptom resolution with conservative measures, 1 patient was excluded because of pregnancy, and 1 patient was lost to follow-up. Thus, 79 patients (91%) received study treatment. Four patients switched groups: 1 from RBL to hemorrhoidectomy, and 3 from hemorrhoidectomy to RBL. Ultimately, 46 patients underwent RBL and 33 patients underwent hemorrhoidectomy (defined as the study population). Twelve-month follow-up was completed by 77 participants (97%), with self-reported recurrence available for 73 participants (92%). At 24 months, 67 participants (85%) completed the questionnaires. Given the consistency of findings between the intention-to-treat and as-treated populations, we report exclusively on the study population.

### Multiple hemorrhoidal ligation: a prospective, randomized trial evaluating a new technique [^114MN93t]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

A modified anoscope was developed, with lateral apertures at the left lateral, right anterior, and right posterior quadrants, to enable synchronous exposure and ligation of all three internal hemorrhoids. Results were compared with those for conventional multiple ligation.

Methods

Postligation pain, complications, and outcomes were compared between synchronous ligation with the new anoscope (synchronous group) and three-quadrant ligation with a conventional anoscope with similar overall dimensions (conventional group).

Results

Twenty-five patients were prospectively randomized to each group. Postligation pain and analgesic requirements were recorded up to 28 days, and postligation complications and outcomes were evaluated for a minimum of 6 months. Narcotic requirements were lower in the synchronous group, but this difference did not achieve statistical significance (P > 0.05, Student's t-test). Secondary hemorrhage occurred in 1 patient (4 percent) in the conventional group but resolved spontaneously. The synchronous group experienced significantly less pain during the ligation procedure and for 2 days afterward (P < 0.01, Wilcoxon's test). External hemorrhoidal thrombosis developed in 4 percent of the synchronous group and 12 percent of conventionally treated patients, all of whom responded to conservative treatment. Repeat ligation was required less often in the synchronous group (16 percent) than with conventional ligation (28 percent). Surgery (completion hemorrhoidectomy for external thrombosis) was necessary in one patient (4 percent) in each group. Anal stenosis developed in one patient in the synchronous group.

Conclusion

The new anoscope provides improved exposure of all three internal hemorrhoids and permits optimal placement of the rubber bands; this may account for the decreased postligation pain and lower repeat ligation rates. Synchronous hemorrhoidal ligation is a less painful method of multiple hemorrhoidal ligation and may improve outcomes compared with conventional multiple ligation.

### Evaluation and management of common anorectal conditions [^114LS5VF]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

The prevalence of benign anorectal conditions in the primary care setting is high, although evidence of effective therapy is often lacking. In addition to recognizing common benign anorectal disorders, physicians must maintain a high index of suspicion for inflammatory and malignant disorders. Patients with red flags such as increased age, family history, persistent anorectal bleeding despite treatment, weight loss, or iron deficiency anemia should undergo colonoscopy. Pruritus ani, or perianal itching, is managed by treating the underlying cause, ensuring proper hygiene, and providing symptomatic relief with oral antihistamines, topical steroids, or topical capsaicin. Effective treatments for anal fissures include onabotulinumtoxinA, topical nitroglycerin, and topical calcium channel blockers. Symptomatic external hemorrhoids are managed with dietary modifications, topical steroids, and analgesics. Thrombosed hemorrhoids are best treated with hemorrhoidectomy if symptoms are present for less than 72 hours. Grades I through III internal hemorrhoids can be managed with rubber band ligation. For the treatment of grade III internal hemorrhoids, surgical hemorrhoidectomy has higher remission rates but increased pain and complication rates compared with rubber band ligation. Anorectal condylomas, or anogenital warts, are treated based on size and location, with office treatment consisting of topical trichloroacetic acid or podophyllin, cryotherapy, or laser treatment. Simple anorectal fistulas can be treated conservatively with sitz baths and analgesics, whereas complex or nonhealing fistulas may require surgery. Fecal impaction may be treated with polyethylene glycol, enemas, or manual disimpaction. Fecal incontinence is generally treated with loperamide and biofeedback. Surgical intervention is reserved for anal sphincter injury.

### Rubber band ligation versus excisional haemorrhoidectomy for haemorrhoids [^116LJPkc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Traditional treatment methods for haemorrhoids fall into two broad groups: less invasive techniques including rubber band ligation (RBL), which tend to produce minimal pain, and the more radical techniques like excisional haemorrhoidectomy (EH), which are inherently more painful. For decades, innovations in the field of haemorrhoidal treatment have centred on modifying the traditional methods to achieve a minimally invasive, less painful procedure and yet with a more sustainable result. The availability of newer techniques has reopened debate on the roles of traditional treatment options for haemorrhoids.

Objectives

To review the efficacy and safety of the two most popular conventional methods of haemorrhoidal treatment, rubber band ligation and excisional haemorrhoidectomy.

Search Strategy

We searched all the major electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing rubber band ligation with excisional haemorrhoidectomy for symptomatic haemorrhoids in adult human patients were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data on to previously designed data extraction sheet. Dichtomous data were presented as relative risk and 95% confidence intervals, and continuous outcomes as weighted mean difference and 95% confidence intervals.

Main Results

Three trials (of poor methodological quality) met the inclusion criteria. Complete remission of haemorrhoidal symptom was better with EH (three studies, 202 patients, RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.83). There was significant heterogeneity between the studies (I2 = 90.5%; P = 0.0001). Similar analysis based on the grading of haemorrhoids revealed the superiority of EH over RBL for grade III haemorrhoids (prolapse that needs manual reduction) (two trials, 116 patients, RR 1.23, CI 1.04 to 1.45; P = 0.01). However, no significant difference was noticed in grade II haemorrhoids (prolapse that reduces spontaneously on cessation of straining) (one trial, 32 patients, RR 1.07, CI 0.94 to 1.21; P = 0.32) Fewer patients required re-treatment after EH (three trials, RR 0.20 CI 0.09 to 0.40; P < 0.00001). Patients undergoing EH were at significantly higher risk of postoperative pain (three trials, fixed effect; 212 patients, RR 1.94, 95% CI 1.62 to 2.33, P < 0.00001). The overall delayed complication rate showed significant difference (P = 0.03) (three trials, 204 patients, RR 6.32, CI 1.15 to 34.89) between the two interventions.

Authors' Conclusions

The present systematic review confirms the long-term efficacy of EH, at least for grade III haemorrhoids, compared to the less invasive technique of RBL but at the expense of increased pain, higher complications and more time off work. However, despite these disadvantages of EH, patient satisfaction and patient's acceptance of the treatment modalities seems to be similar following both the techniques implying patient's preference for complete long-term cure of symptoms and possibly less concern for minor complications. So, RBL can be adopted as the choice of treatment for grade II haemorrhoids with similar results but with out the side effects of EH while reserving EH for grade III haemorrhoids or recurrence after RBL. More robust study is required to make definitive conclusions.

### Hemorrhoids: what are the options in 2018? [^115TLNVQ]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Efforts continue to improve the treatment of patients with symptomatic hemorrhoidal disease by interventions designed to improve efficiency and effectiveness, including by reducing intraoperative and postoperative pain, decreasing operating times, minimizing blood loss and controlling symptoms and recurrence rates. Simultaneously, there are also renewed efforts to minimize the number of patients who will require procedural intervention by focusing on conservative measures that encourage better bowel regulation and habits. The purpose of this brief report is to review the current status of the diagnosis and treatment of patients with hemorrhoidal disease. Overall, new procedures or procedural refinements to existing techniques continue to be introduced with promising short-term outcomes - at least in some instances. In most instances, long-term follow-up or equivalency data are still being accumulated such that a definitive, unequivocal answer to what is truly the best alternative to traditional hemorrhoidectomy remains controversial. One of the challenges is heterogeneity as regards diagnosis, intervention and, especially, outcomes measures such that comparing therapies is too difficult. A recent initiative to standardize metrics has promise.

Recent Findings

Recent studies largely appear to suggest that conservative treatment approaches and managing patient expectations are critically important in which a primary objective should be to minimize the progression to symptomatic disease and complications in patients who are diagnosed with hemorrhoids. The pace of change as regards the development of new or improved surgical techniques appears may be accelerating.

Summary

Progress is being made and the knowledge base is being expanded as regards the treatment options for patients with hemorrhoids and expected outcomes. A key initiative to standardize the approaches to diagnosis and treatment about staging, procedural interventions and outcomes will facilitate comparative analytics, if successful.

Health-Related Quality of Life

Over 12 months, the mean QALY score was 0.898 (SD 0.10) for the RBL group and 0.942 (SD 0.07) for the hemorrhoidectomy group (Table 3). Linear regression showed a significant difference favoring hemorrhoidectomy (mean difference –0.045; 95% CI, –0.087 to –0.004; p = 0.016), with the lower bound of the 95% CI exceeding the noninferiority limit. Figure 2 illustrates HR-QoL trends from baseline to 2 years. Although baseline scores were comparable (p = 0.259), the RBL group initially exhibited higher scores up to week 1. From 6 weeks onward, hemorrhoidectomy group scores were higher, with both groups leveling off by 2 years.

Methods

Search strategy

This meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A comprehensive literature search was performed using PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases from their inception to September 25, 2024. The search strategy combined Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and free-text terms related to hemorrhoids, surgical interventions, and completely non-invasive conservative treatments. Keywords included "hemorrhoids", "surgery", "hemorrhoidectomy", "Doppler-guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation", "conservative treatment", "non-surgical", "medical therapy", "diet", and "fiber". The full search strategy for each database was presented in Table S1.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

The literature screening process was conducted independently by two authors (L.Q. and X.B.), any discrepancies resolved through consultation with a third author (F.C.). Studies were included if they met the following criteria: (1) Studies with patients with a confirmed diagnosis of hemorrhoids; (2) Studies with comparison between surgical treatments (e.g. hemorrhoidectomy, Doppler-guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation) and completely non-invasive conservative treatments (e.g. pharmacological interventions, dietary modifications); (3) Studies are randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or observational cohort studies; (4) Studies published in English. Exclusion criteria were: (1) duplicate publications; (2) non-clinical studies, including reviews, expert opinions, case reports, conference abstracts, and animal studies; (3) Studies without a control group or single-arm studies; (4) Studies with inaccessible full texts or incomplete/unextractable data; (5) Studies employing minimally invasive procedures such as rubber band ligation, sclerotherapy, or infrared coagulation.

Data extraction

Data was extracted independently by two reviewers (L.Q. and X.B.). The following information was collected: First author, publication year, study design, sample size, age, type of surgical procedure, specifics of conservative treatment, symptom resolution, pain reduction, types and rates of complication, recovery, and recurrence. Any discrepancies in data extraction were resolved through consensus. The methods and time points of measuring pain scores were presented in Table S2.

### Milligan-morgan hemorrhoidectomy combined with rubber band ligation and polidocanol foam sclerotherapy for the management of grade III / IV hemorrhoids: a retrospective study [^114cxuuH]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

With more minimally invasive surgical concepts being developed, the focus of various surgical procedures for treating hemorrhoids is to maximize the protection of the anal transitional epithelium and the anal cushion tissue. Therefore, we adopted a new combined procedure of MMH with RBL and polidocanol foam sclerotherapy to treat III/IV hemorrhoids to improve the effectiveness and reduce some typical complications of the three treatment methods.

According to our results, the median operation time in the MMH + RBL + PFS group was similar to that in the MMH group (p > 0.05), and the median number of incisions was less in the MMH + RBL + PFS group than in the MMH group (p < 0.05). These findings demonstrate that the MMH + RBL + PFS procedure could protect part of the anal cushion by ligating hemorrhoids and loose prolapsed mucosa, and the downward moving anal cushion can be moved upward, achieving the purpose of removing hemorrhoid tissue, fixing mucous membrane simultaneously, and correcting prolapse. Internal hemorrhoids can gradually necrotize or be moved upward, while external hemorrhoids may decrease or transform from an unbounded circular shape to a relatively clear boundary, reducing the difficulty of hemorrhoidectomy and decreasing the number and length of incisions. Therefore, there was no significant difference in operation time between the two groups. There was no significant difference in intraoperative bleeding between the two groups, which was related to the use of a fine needle-type electric knife, which effectively reduced intraoperative bleeding.

### Cost-effectiveness of rubber band ligation versus hemorrhoidectomy for the treatment of grade III hemorrhoids: analysis using evidence from the HOLLAND randomized controlled trial [^114BEnh1]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In the design of this trial, we initially hypothesized that "up to 2 RBL treatments are noninferior to hemorrhoidectomy in terms of quality of life and recurrence risk, whereas being more cost-effective". Our findings challenge this assumption, showing that while RBL offers lower upfront costs, hemorrhoidectomy provides better long-term clinical outcomes, including reduced recurrence and improved quality of life. For patients with grade III hemorrhoids, hemorrhoidectomy may be more cost-effective than RBL, and therefore, caution is needed before discarding it as a routine first-line treatment solely based on rising health care costs or limited operating room availability.

### Systematic review of randomized trials comparing rubber band ligation with excisional haemorrhoidectomy [^117Dkrb4]. The British Journal of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background and Method

This review compares the two most popular treatments for haemorrhoids, namely rubber band ligation (RBL) and excisional haemorrhoidectomy. Randomized trials were identified from the major electronic databases. Symptom control, retreatment, postoperative pain, complications, time off work and patient satisfaction were assessed. Relative risk (RR) and weighted mean difference with 95 per cent confidence interval (c.i.) were estimated using a random-effects model for dichotomous and continuous outcomes respectively.

Results

Three trials met the inclusion criteria and all were of poor methodological quality. Complete remission of haemorrhoidal symptoms was better after haemorrhoidectomy (RR 1.68 (95 per cent c.i 1.00 to 2.83)). There was significant heterogeneity between the studies (I(2) = 90.5 per cent; P < 0.001). Fewer patients required retreatment after haemorrhoidectomy (RR 0.20 (95 per cent c.i 0.09 to 0.40)), but anal stenosis, postoperative haemorrhage and incontinence to flatus were more common with this operation.

Conclusions

Haemorrhoidectomy produced better long-term symptom control in patients with grade III haemorrhoids, but was associated with more postoperative complications than RBL.

### Global treatment of haemorrhoids – A worldwide snapshot audit conducted by the international society of university colon and rectal surgeons [^115mzWzi]. Colorectal Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

There is no universally accepted treatment consensus for haemorrhoids, and thus, management has been individualized all over the world. This study was conducted to assess a global view of how surgeons manage haemorrhoids.

Methods

The research panel of the International Society of University Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ISUCRS) developed a voluntary, anonymous questionnaire evaluating surgeons' experience, volume and treatment approaches to haemorrhoids. The 44 multiple-choice questionnaire was available for onemonth via the ISUCRS email database and the social media platforms Viber and WhatsApp.

Results

The survey was completed by 1005 surgeons from 103 countries; 931 (92.6%) were in active practice, 819 (81.5%) were between 30 and 60years of age, and 822 (81.8%) were male. Detailed patient history (92.9%), perineal inspection (91.2%), and digital rectal examination (91.1%) were the most common assessment methods. For internal haemorrhoids, 924 (91.9%) of participants graded them I-IV, with the degree of haemorrhoids being the most important factor considered to determine the treatment approach (76.3%). The most common nonprocedural/conservative treatment consisted of increased daily fibre intake (86.9%), increased water intake (82.7%), and normalization of bowel habits/toilet training (74.4%). Conservative treatment was the first-line treatment for symptomatic first (92.5%), second (72.4%) and third (47.3%) degree haemorrhoids; however, surgery was the first-line treatment for symptomatic fourth degree haemorrhoids (77.6%). Rubber band ligation was the second-line treatment in first (50.7%) and second (47.2%) degree haemorrhoids, whereas surgery was the second-line treatment in third (82.9%) and fourth (16.7%) degree symptomatic haemorrhoids. Rubber band ligation was performed in the office by 645(64.2%) of the participants. The most common surgical procedure performed for haemorrhoids was an excisional haemorrhoidectomy for both internal (87.1%) and external (89.7%) haemorrhoids - with 716 (71.2%) of participants removing 1, 2 or 3 sectors as necessary.

Conclusion

Although there is no global haemorrhoidal treatment consensus, there are many practice similarities among the different cultures, resources, volume and experience of surgeons around the world. With additional studies, a consensus statement could potentially be developed.

### Novel endoscopic delivery modality of infrared coagulation therapy for internal hemorrhoids [^1172bSvo]. Surgical Endoscopy (2012). Low credibility.

Traditional surgical hemorrhoidectomy excises both the internal and external hemorrhoid cushions and therefore is associated with a great deal of pain during the postoperative recovery period. The significant pain associated with this operation has led to a variety of nonsurgical treatment options, which have been developed to treat patients with symptoms primarily related to internal hemorrhoid disease. These nonsurgical treatment options include rubber band ligation, infrared coagulation, bipolar diathermy, direct-current electrotherapy, sclerotherapy, and cryotherapy. All of these nonsurgical options cause fibrosis, scarring, shrinkage, and fixation of the internal hemorrhoid cushions and minimize symptoms of internal hemorrhoid disease.

Patients with hemorrhoid disease are frequently encouraged to undergo a colonoscopy before the initiation of treatment for hemorrhoid disease to eliminate potential neoplastic sources within the colon and rectum as a source of the patient's symptoms. Currently, the nonsurgical treatment options of internal hemorrhoid disease cannot be done without the use of an anal retractor (anoscope), dedicated lighting source, and specialized instruments necessary for the nonsurgical treatment. In addition, nonsurgical treatment options are frequently performed at a different time and location than the colonoscopy. This leads to inefficiency for both time and expense for the endoscopist, the endoscopy facility, and the patient.
