## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the R‑on‑T phenomenon, including its definition, electrophysiologic mechanism, clinical contexts, risk stratification, and management implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the precise definition and ECG timing. Then, I should verify the mechanistic basis linking repolarization dispersion to triggered activity. Next, I will review the clinical contexts where R‑on‑T is most consequential. After that, I need to assess risk modifiers and prognostic markers. Finally, I will synthesize practical management principles and highlight pitfalls and special scenarios, making sure I cross-check each claim against the cited sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition and timing so I don't misstate the phenomenon. R‑on‑T refers to a premature ventricular complex (PVC) that falls on the T wave of the preceding beat, i.e., during ventricular repolarization, which is mechanistically the window of electrical vulnerability; this timing is the key ECG signature that distinguishes it from other PVC morphologies and underlies its arrhythmic potential [^116txq5n].

> Now, I need to check the mechanistic basis. The T wave corresponds to phase 3 repolarization, and during this interval there is marked dispersion of repolarization across the ventricular wall; a PVC landing in this window can trigger phase 2 reentry or early afterdepolarizations, precipitating polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, which is why R‑on‑T is classically linked to malignant arrhythmias rather than benign ectopy [^1176NBJp] [^116txq5n].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about every PVC on a T wave being equally dangerous; I should review the clinical contexts where R‑on‑T carries the highest risk. Drug‑induced torsades de pointes (TdP) is a prime example, where a short‑long‑short R‑R sequence initiated by a short‑coupled PVC on the T wave is a characteristic prodrome, and the risk escalates with QT prolongation and T‑U distortion; this pattern is repeatedly described in hospital guidance for TdP prevention and aligns with the mechanistic vulnerability during repolarization [^111SvhXr] [^111L7C2T]. But wait, what if the substrate is ischemia rather than acquired long QT? Acute myocardial ischemia creates injury currents and repolarization heterogeneity that can potentiate R‑on‑T–triggered ventricular fibrillation, so ischemic settings remain high‑risk contexts for this phenomenon as well [^notfound].

> I should confirm other syndromic substrates. Early repolarization syndrome and Brugada phenotypes exhibit J‑waves and transmural repolarization gradients that can facilitate phase 2 reentry; in these J‑wave syndromes, adrenergic modulation can suppress or accentuate J‑waves and arrhythmic expression, underscoring a mechanistic kinship with R‑on‑T vulnerability even if the surface ECG does not always show a classic R‑on‑T pattern at baseline [^116txq5n] [^1158b2tE]. Let me also consider structural disease: arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy and ischemic cardiomyopathy with scar create dispersion of repolarization and conduction, providing a substrate where a well‑timed extrasystole can destabilize repolarization fronts and initiate ventricular arrhythmias, again converging on the same vulnerability window [^115MDiav] [^116WUN41].

> Next, I should review risk modifiers and prognostic markers so I don't overgeneralize. The degree of QT prolongation is pivotal; each 10 ms increase in QTc confers an approximately 5–7% exponential rise in TdP risk, and QTc values above 500 ms are associated with a 2–3 fold higher risk, which makes a short‑coupled PVC on a prolonged T wave particularly ominous in drug‑induced settings [^111L7C2T]. I need to ensure I also account for repolarization lability: T‑wave alternans, even microvolt, signals latent repolarization instability and predicts malignant arrhythmias; likewise, a prolonged Tpeak‑Tend interval and exaggerated T‑U distortion after pauses are strong premonitory markers of TdP and thus amplify the significance of an R‑on‑T PVC in that milieu [^115KXyoB] [^111L7C2T]. But wait, what if the substrate is ischemic rather than channelopathic? Regional dispersion of repolarization and restitution dynamics in ischemia can similarly magnify the arrhythmic potential of R‑on‑T ectopy, so clinical context remains essential when interpreting a single PVC morphology [^116WUN41].

> I will now examine management principles, and I should double‑check that I'm aligning with guideline‑based strategies. Immediate priorities include correcting modifiable triggers: withdraw QT‑prolonging agents, correct electrolytes (notably potassium and magnesium), treat acute ischemia, and stabilize hemodynamics; in drug‑induced TdP, the short‑long‑short sequence often heralds episodes, so anticipatory monitoring and magnesium prophylaxis are prudent when QTc is prolonged and R‑on‑T PVCs appear [^111SvhXr] [^111L7C2T]. For secondary prevention in high‑risk phenotypes, implantable cardioverter‑defibrillator (ICD) therapy is appropriate when sustained ventricular arrhythmias have occurred or when risk is high per disease‑specific criteria, and contemporary appropriate‑use documents support ICDs in contexts like Brugada pattern with sustained VT/VF or long QT not on beta‑blockers, which intersect with R‑on‑T risk scenarios [^112VTgBc]. Let me reconsider pharmacologic suppression: isoproterenol can suppress recurrent ventricular arrhythmias and reduce J‑waves in J‑wave syndromes, illustrating how adrenergic modulation can acutely modify repolarization dispersion and the arrhythmic substrate, though this is context‑specific and not a universal solution for R‑on‑T [^1158b2tE].

> But wait, I should verify a common pitfall: not every PVC that visually lands on a T wave is truly "R‑on‑T" in a mechanistically meaningful sense. Artifact, misplacement, and lead selection can distort timing, and in wide QRS rhythms or bundle branch block, secondary repolarization changes can mimic vulnerable windows; careful ECG acquisition, standardized lead selection for interval measurement, and attention to vector relationships help avoid overcalling R‑on‑T when the substrate for dispersion‑driven triggered activity is absent [^112ouMyP] [^114qJ5nj] [^111ZfAGp]. I should double‑check that I'm not conflating R‑on‑T with other high‑frequency ECG markers; fragmented QRS and other depolarization abnormalities reflect different substrates and should not be used as surrogates for R‑on‑T vulnerability without corroborating repolarization evidence [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize and make sure nothing critical is missing. R‑on‑T is fundamentally a timing‑dependent manifestation of repolarization vulnerability: a PVC during the T wave exploits transmural dispersion and can trigger phase 2 reentry or early afterdepolarizations, leading to polymorphic VT/VF in susceptible substrates such as drug‑induced long QT, acute ischemia, and J‑wave syndromes; risk is amplified by prolonged QTc, T‑wave alternans, and Tpeak‑Tend prolongation, and management hinges on correcting triggers, stabilizing repolarization, and deploying ICD therapy when indicated, with vigilance for artifact and secondary repolarization changes that can confound interpretation [^116txq5n] [^111SvhXr] [^111L7C2T] [^115KXyoB] [^112VTgBc] [^112ouMyP].

The R-on-T phenomenon is a **premature ventricular contraction (PVC) occurring on the T wave** of the preceding beat, coinciding with ventricular repolarization vulnerability [^116txq5n] and risking ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation [^116txq5n]. It is most dangerous in settings of **prolonged QT, ischemia, or electrolyte imbalance** [^notfound] and requires urgent evaluation and management to prevent sudden cardiac death [^notfound].

---

## Electrophysiological basis

During repolarization, **ventricular myocytes exhibit electrical heterogeneity** — epicardial cells repolarize earlier than endocardial cells — creating a vulnerable window for reentry and triggered activity [^116txq5n]. A PVC falling on the T wave can **initiate polymorphic VT or VF**, especially when repolarization is prolonged or heterogeneous [^116txq5n].

---

## Clinical significance and risk factors

R-on-T is clinically significant because it can precipitate **life-threatening arrhythmias** [^111SvhXr]. Risk increases with:

- **Prolonged QT interval**: Congenital or acquired long QT syndrome [^111L7C2T].
- **Myocardial ischemia**: Acute coronary syndromes [^notfound].
- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia [^notfound].
- **Drug-induced QT prolongation**: Antiarrhythmics, antidepressants, antipsychotics [^113d815D].

---

## Clinical scenarios and patient populations

R-on-T is observed in diverse settings, including:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Patient population** |
|-|-|
| Acute myocardial infarction | Coronary artery disease patients |
| Long QT syndrome | Congenital or acquired QT prolongation |
| Drug-induced QT prolongation | Patients on QT-prolonging medications |
| Electrolyte imbalances | Critically ill patients, diuretic users |
| Structural heart disease | Heart failure, cardiomyopathy patients |

---

## Diagnostic identification on ECG

On ECG, R-on-T is identified by a **PVC falling on the T wave** of the preceding beat [^116txq5n]. Key features include:

- **Early PVC**: Occurs during the T wave.
- **QT prolongation**: Often present.
- **Polymorphic VT**: May follow the R-on-T PVC.

---

## Management strategies

Management focuses on **correcting underlying causes** and preventing recurrence:

- **Correct electrolytes**: Potassium and magnesium normalization [^notfound].
- **Withdraw QT-prolonging drugs**: Stop offending agents [^notfound].
- **Treat ischemia**: Revascularization or medical therapy [^notfound].
- **Antiarrhythmic therapy**: Beta-blockers, amiodarone, lidocaine.
- **ICD implantation**: For high-risk patients with recurrent VT/VF [^112VTgBc].

---

## Prognostic implications

R-on-T is associated with **increased risk of sudden cardiac death**, particularly in patients with structural heart disease, prolonged QT, or ischemia [^notfound]. Early recognition and management are critical to improve outcomes [^notfound].

---

## Preventive measures

Preventive strategies include:

- **Risk assessment**: Identify patients at risk of QT prolongation or ischemia [^114iLfLy].
- **Monitor ECG**: Regular ECG in patients on QT-prolonging drugs [^113d815D].
- **Educate patients**: Recognize symptoms and seek prompt care.

---

The R-on-T phenomenon is a **PVC occurring on the T wave** during ventricular repolarization, creating a vulnerable window for malignant arrhythmias [^116txq5n]. It is most dangerous in prolonged QT, ischemia, or electrolyte imbalance and requires urgent correction of precipitating factors and targeted therapy to prevent sudden cardiac death [^notfound].

### Ventricular repolarization components on the electrocardiogram: cellular basis and clinical significance [^116txq5n]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Ventricular repolarization components on the surface electrocardiogram (ECG) include J (Osborn) waves, ST-segments, and T- and U-waves, which dynamically change in morphology under various pathophysiologic conditions and play an important role in the development of ventricular arrhythmias. Our primary objective in this review is to identify the ionic and cellular basis for ventricular repolarization components on the body surface ECG under normal and pathologic conditions, including a discussion of their clinical significance. A specific attempt to combine typical clinical ECG tracings with transmembrane electrical recordings is made to illustrate their logical linkage. A transmural voltage gradient during initial ventricular repolarization, which results from the presence of a prominent transient outward K(+) current (I(to))-mediated action potential (AP) notch in the epicardium, but not endocardium, manifests as a J-wave on the ECG. The J-wave is associated with the early repolarization syndrome and Brugada syndrome. ST-segment elevation, as seen in Brugada syndrome and acute myocardial ischemia, cannot be fully explained by using the classic concept of an "injury current" that flows from injured to uninjured myocardium. Rather, ST-segment elevation may be largely secondary to a loss of the AP dome in the epicardium, but not endocardium. The T-wave is a symbol of transmural dispersion of repolarization. The R-on-T phenomenon (an extrasystole originating on the T-wave of a preceding ventricular beat) is probably due to transmural propagation of phase 2 re-entry or phase 2 early after depolarization that could potentially initiate polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.

T-wave alternans — definition, measurement, and clinical significance: T-wave alternans signifies T-wave amplitude variations that alternate every second beat and is typically observed as microvolt-level variation; it indicates latent instability of repolarization predictive of malignant arrhythmias; it is generally not present at the resting state even in high-risk patients, and a stress test (exercise or pharmacological stress or pacing), requiring special equipment and analysis software, is needed to provoke it; although its clinical utility has not been fully defined, it holds substantial potential in identifying patients at high risk of serious arrhythmic events.

The U wave — morphology and lead distribution: The U wave is a mechanoelectric phenomenon that results in a low-amplitude, low-frequency deflection that occurs after the T wave, and it is frequently absent in the limb leads and is most evident in leads V2 and V3.

Circulation (2009). Medium credibility.

AHA/ACCF/HRS electrocardiogram (ECG) repolarization segments and waves — The ST segment corresponds to the plateau phase of the ventricular transmembrane action potential, with slow voltage change and only small voltage gradients; the absence of significant gradients during the ST and TP segments explains why they are normally nearly flat and at approximately the same level, that is, isoelectric. Electric diastole corresponds to the TP segment when ventricular myocardial cells are at their resting transmembrane potential of approximately −85 mV. The T wave corresponds to the phase of rapid ventricular repolarization (phase 3) of the ventricular action potential. Abnormalities in the ST segment, T wave, and duration of the QT interval reflect abnormalities in ventricular repolarization, and the U wave most likely represents an electromechanical phenomenon that occurs after repolarization is completed.

Circulation (2009). Medium credibility.

Primary and secondary repolarization abnormalities — coexistence and interpretation — may occur concurrently; ventricular hypertrophy is associated with changes in the shape and duration of the ventricular action potential of isolated ventricular cells, and these changes may contribute to ST- and T-wave changes independent of QRS-amplitude changes and prolongation of the QRS complex. A combination of primary and secondary repolarization abnormalities should also be considered when T-wave polarity does not change as anticipated by the changes in the QRS complex.

Circulation (2009). Medium credibility.

Secondary repolarization abnormalities — recognition and vector relationships — are characterized by directions opposite to depolarization vectors: In left bundle-branch block, the ST-segment and T-wave vectors are generally directed opposite to the mean QRS vector; in right bundle-branch block they are directed opposite to the slow terminal component of the QRS complex; and in ventricular preexcitation, ST-T changes are directed opposite to the delta wave of the QRS complex. When the direction of the QRS axis is normal, an abnormal direction of the T-wave axis is generally an indication of primary repolarization abnormalities. The practical utility of the ventricular gradient in differentiating primary from secondary repolarization abnormalities has not been demonstrated. With transiently altered ventricular conduction from ectopic ventricular complexes or transient bundle-branch blocks, secondary ST- and T-wave changes usually revert promptly to the prior pattern, whereas some secondary repolarization changes take longer (hours or days) to develop and to dissipate, such as those associated with prolonged ventricular pacing.

### Electrocardiographic electrode misplacement, misconnection, and artifact [^112ouMyP]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are performed by humans, and thus are subject to human error. An underappreciated source of electrocardiographic abnormality is electrode misconnection, both limb and precordial, and improper placement, which is principally an issue with the precordial electrodes due to anatomic variation. Patterns of abnormality exist; recognition allows the emergency physician to avoid mistaking the resulting electrocardiographic findings for true pathology.

Objectives

The purpose of this clinical review is to describe the patterns of electrocardiographic electrode reversal, misplacement, and artifact and thus make them recognizable to the Emergency Physician.

Discussion

Common limb electrode reversals feature distinctive patterns manifesting as unexpected morphologic and frontal plane axis changes in the QRS complexes in the limb and augmented leads. Precordial electrode misplacement (improper positioning of the electrodes on the chest) is common and may mimic a pseudoinfarction pattern, or ST-segment/T-wave changes, which must be recognized as the result of the misplacement rather than true cardiac ischemia. Precordial electrode reversal should be suspected when the normal R/S wave amplitude transition is violated. Electrocardiographic artifact must be distinguished from dysrhythmia to avoid a potentially hazardous progression to unnecessary diagnostics and therapeutics.

Conclusions

The hallmarks of electrode misconnection, misplacement, and electrocardiographic artifact can be easily mastered by the Emergency Physician; recognition of these findings can positively impact patient care by avoiding unnecessary intervention secondary to misattribution of findings on the 12-lead ECG to cardiac pathology.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Medium credibility.

AHA/ACCF/HRS electrocardiogram interpretation — acute ischemia/infarction — identifies the electrocardiogram (ECG) as the single most important initial clinical test for diagnosing myocardial ischemia and infarction, and notes that correct interpretation, particularly in the emergency department, is usually the basis for immediate therapeutic interventions and/or subsequent diagnostic tests. ECG changes that occur with acute ischemia and infarction include peaking of the T waves (hyperacute T‑wave changes), ST‑segment elevation and/or depression, changes in the QRS complex, and inverted T waves. ST‑segment changes are attributed to the flow of currents, referred to as "injury currents", generated by voltage gradients between ischemic and nonischemic myocardium during the resting and plateau phases of the ventricular action potential, which correspond to the TQ and ST segments of the ECG.

### A negative T-wave in electrocardiogram at 50 years predicted lifetime mortality in a random population-based cohort [^113DWx7r]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a powerful and easily available tool for detection of cardiac disorder in asymptomatic individuals, often preceding symptoms by considerable time. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Several studies have linked ECG abnormalities with CV events and prognosis in asymptomatic adults 6, 7, 8, 9 predominantly for major ECG aberrations. 10, 11, 12

Minor ECG abnormalities are common from middle age, 13, 14 and frequently seen in clinical practice in asymptomatic subjects. They are generally regarded as unspecific, not linked to specific myocardial disease. 13, 15, 16, 17, 18 The prognostic value of minor ECG abnormalities is not fully known, but has a potential for preventive considerations. Here, we present a longitudinal population‐based observational cohort study of 50‐year old men, investigating the correlation between a negative T‐wave in resting ECG and mortality during 48 years of follow‐up.

5 CONCLUSION

A negative T‐wave in ECG registered at 50 years of age in asymptomatic individuals from a randomized observational cohort carried an increased risk of all‐cause and CV death during lifetime follow‐up. The enhanced risk remained after adjustment for other ECG abnormalities and other CV risk factors. A major T‐wave inversion conveyed a higher risk than minor and a negative T‐wave carried enhanced risk also in the absence of other risk factors.

### Cardiac biomarkers of disordered eating: a case for decreased mean R wave amplitude [^116KfSFM]. Psychiatry Research (2019). Medium credibility.

The purpose of this study was to identify cardiac biomarkers of disordered eating. Mean R wave amplitude (mV), mean T wave amplitude (mV), QRS interval (sec), QTc interval (sec), and Tpeak-Tend interval (sec) were assessed via electrocardiography among women with clinical (n = 53) and subclinical (n = 56) eating disorder symptoms versus asymptomatic controls (n = 32). QRS and QTc intervals were significantly longer and mean T and R wave amplitudes significantly lower among women with clinical symptoms compared to asymptomatic controls. QTc interval length was significantly longer and mean R wave amplitude was significantly lower among women with subclinical symptoms versus asymptomatic controls. Decreased mean R wave amplitude yielded a comparable effect size as QTc when differentiating between asymptomatic and subclinical groups and a larger effect size than QTc when differentiating between asymptomatic and clinical groups, representing a promising clinical biomarker.

### Electrocardiographic manifestations: pulmonary embolism [^111YE2qy]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The electrocardiographic findings associated with pulmonary embolism have been well described in the medical literature for over 50 years. These abnormalities include changes in rhythm, QRS axis, and morphology, particularly in the QRS and T waves. Such findings may reflect hemodynamic changes, such as right heart strain, as well as myocardial ischemia associated with the disease. Although certain findings may correlate with the severity of pulmonary embolism, the overall utility of the electrocardiogram is limited due to the variable presence, frequency, and transient nature of most of the abnormalities associated with the disease.

### Prevention of torsade de pointes in hospital settings: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association and the American college of cardiology foundation [^111SvhXr]. Circulation (2010). Medium credibility.

Torsade de pointes (TdP) — electrocardiographic onset and behavior in drug‑induced cases usually begin with a short‑long‑short pattern of R‑R cycles initiated by a short‑coupled premature ventricular complex (PVC) followed by a compensatory pause and then another PVC near the peak of the T wave; episodes typically show a warm‑up phenomenon, the TdP rate ranges from 160 to 240 beats per minute, and spontaneous termination often shows slowing in the last 2 to 3 beats. The term is better confined to episodic polymorphic tachycardias with marked (> 500 ms) QT‑interval prolongation and QT‑U deformity, reflecting a distinct mechanistic and therapeutic entity.

### Prevention of torsade de pointes in hospital settings: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association and the American college of cardiology foundation [^111L7C2T]. Circulation (2010). Medium credibility.

Premonitory ECG signs of torsade de pointes (TdP) — risk increases with corrected QT interval (QTc), as each 10‑ms increase in QTc contributes approximately a 5% to 7% exponential increase in risk; a patient with a QTc of 500 ms has a 63% to 97% higher risk than a patient with a QTc of 440 ms, and data from congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) indicate that a QTc > 500 ms is associated with a 2‑ to 3‑fold higher risk, with similar increased risk in drug‑induced TdP when QTc > 500 ms is exceeded. There is no threshold of QT prolongation at which TdP is certain to occur; before onset, a short‑long‑short R‑R sequence is associated with marked QT prolongation and T‑U–wave distortion, TdP is especially likely when QT prolongation reflects an increase in Tpeak–Tend, and exaggerated QT‑interval prolongation with T‑U distortion after a pause should be considered a strong marker of risk for TdP.

A plea is made for not using in publications the terms J-wave syndromes and early repolarization until such terms are properly defined by appropriate task forces established by recognized authorities. The currently used electrographic terminology, including J-point elevation, meets our needs.

ECG interpretation is a core skill for any healthcare practitioner that looks after children. The article aims to educate the reader in basic interpretation of paediatric ECG in a succinct, interactive, organised manner in a way that it can be easily referenced and applied in everyday clinical practice. We include clinical examples as well as age and sex-related reference ranges for QT intervals, P-wave duration, Q-wave amplitude, QRS complex duration, R-wave and S-wave amplitude, R/S ratio and PR intervals.

### Prevention of torsade de pointes in hospital settings: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association and the American college of cardiology foundation [^114qJ5nj]. Circulation (2010). Medium credibility.

Manual measurement — recommended lead choice, special situations, and atrial fibrillation approach are outlined: the lead for manual QT measurement is one from the patient's 12‑lead electrocardiogram (ECG) with a T‑wave amplitude of at least 2 mm and a well‑defined T‑wave end; when conduction causes a wide QRS, one method is to measure a J‑T interval from the end of the QRS to the end of the T wave; in atrial fibrillation, one way is to identify the shortest and longest R‑R intervals, calculate the QTc for each, and average the 2 QTc values; alternatively, a long rhythm strip can be used to determine whether the interval from R wave to T‑wave peak (or nadir) is more than 50% of the R‑R interval, indicating that the QTc would be longer than the critical threshold of 500 ms if measured.

LIMITATIONS

A major limitation of this study is the heterogeneity of the input data because of differences in methodology, population, and ethnicity. Variabilities in the ascertainment of ECG markers and adjudication of the outcomes may affect the quality of the overall data.

Our systematic review considered the overall data of the published series. We didn't go into detail about specific issues regarding subgroups such as women and children, who have a very challenging risk profile. 53, 54, 55 In addition, many of the pathophysiological mechanisms proposed in these studies are hypothetical, that is, not based on experimental data. Therefore, further rigorous studies are needed to confirm these hypotheses.

### Early repolarisation: controversies and clinical implications [^114NZTKB]. Heart (2012). Low credibility.

Early repolarisation was previously considered a benign variant but in recent years has emerged as a marker of risk for sudden death. In part, this appears to reflect a change in the definition. ECG territory, degree of J-point elevation and ST-segment morphology are associated with different degrees of risk for subsequent ventricular arrhythmia. At present the dataset is insufficient to allow risk stratification in asymptomatic individuals and further epidemiological and mechanistic research is required.

### The role of the ratio of J-point elevation magnitude and R-wave amplitude on the same ECG lead in the risk stratification of subjects with early repolarization pattern [^115fkTEH]. Clinical Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Just as high-risk populations for cardiac arrest exist in patients with Brugada syndrome or long QT syndrome, high-risk and low-risk populations for cardiac arrest also exist in patients with early repolarization pattern (ERP).

Hypothesis

Electrocardiographic (ECG) characteristics can aid the risk stratification of patients with ERP.

Methods

Electrocardiographic parameters such as magnitude of J-point elevation and J/R ratio were measured. The magnitude of J-point elevation, leads with J points elevated, J/R ratio, morphology of the ST segment, and QT/QTc interval were used in comparative analysis in 2 groups: 57 patients with ERP and cardiac arrest (cardiac arrest group) and 100 patients with ERP but without cardiac arrest (control group).

Results

There was no statistical difference in clinical characteristics of the 2 groups. The J/R ratio in the cardiac arrest group was significantly higher than in the control group (26.8% ± 18.1% vs 16.3% ± 10.3%, respectively; P < 0.001) and the proportion of horizontal/descending ST segments (70.2%) was significantly higher than in the control group (29.0%), but the proportion of ascending/upsloping ST segments (29.8%) was significantly lower than in the control group (71.0%; P < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression revealed that higher J/R ratio and horizontal/descending ST segment were independently associated with increased risk of cardiac arrest in patients with ERP.

Conclusions

In patients with ERP and cardiac arrest, J/R ratios were relatively higher and mostly with horizontal/descending ST segments, suggesting that J/R ratio and ST-segment morphology may be used as indicators for risk stratification in patients with ERP.

Novel ECG Features of Ischemia

The novel features identified in this study as plausible markers of ACS that are potentially mechanistically linked to myocardial ischemia bring a valuable addition to clinical knowledge. Intriguingly, although the classical ST and T wave amplitude measures were among the predictive features, they ranked as the least important when compared with the contribution of other novel features (Figure 5). Some of the observed patterns and clusters of the most important features can be summarized in the following major categories:

Features of the nondipolar voltage, which quantifies the spatial electrical dispersion in the fourth to eighth eigenvalues. In the context of ST, T, and J components, the nondipolar voltage would indicate the magnitude of diffusion or widespread global changes, 24 a probable measure of circumferential ischemia in ACS.
Ventricular activation time, which quantifies the time from Q onset to R peak. Whereas depolarization of the whole ventricular myocytes is assessed through global QRS duration, localized regional depolarization can be assessed using individual leads facing that myocardial region. Thus, ventricular activation time measured from anterior and inferior leads would primarily indicate transmural conduction delays in the left ventricle and apex, 25 a probable consequence of localized ischemia in these regions.
QRS and T axes and corresponding angles, which characterize the propagation direction of depolarization and repolarization signals and, hence, global electrical dispersion. In the context of ACS, these features can reflect the altered electromechanical forces in the ventricular myocardium and probably the resulting global remodeling after myocardial injury. 26
Waveform eigenvalues and corresponding ratios, which quantifies the principal components of ECG signal in perpendicular space. The altered signal propagation speed and velocity between healthy and ischemic myocardium leads to spatial heterogeneity and significantly impacts these features. 9 Thus, in the context of ACS, these eigenvalues would resemble regional myocardial ischemia (or injury vectors). 8
Other T wave metrics that quantify duration (eg, T peak T end), amplitude (eg, relative R‐to‐T), area (eg, JT peak area), morphology (eg, T asymmetry), and loop characteristics (eg, loop dispersion). Some studies have demonstrated that such simple T wave metrics may better predict early ischemia as compared with ST segment, 27 a finding that is supported by our current results.
Residual high frequency noise in the signal. Although this might be a simple incidental finding reflective of acuity of illness at the time of ECG acquisition, we previously demonstrated that such noise highly correlates with beat‐to‐beat repolarization lability. 16 This lability can resemble the alternans of intracellular Ca +2 transient in adjacent cells during acute myocardial ischemia.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for pre-excitation syndrome, more specifically with respect to electrophysiology study, HRS/PACES 2012 guidelines recommend to consider performing invasive risk stratification (transesophageal or intracardiac) to assess the shortest pre-excited R-R interval in AF in pediatric patients, if the noninvasive testing does not demonstrate clear and abrupt loss of pre-excitation.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy — epsilon wave definition, leads, prevalence, and diagnostic limitations are provided. The epsilon wave is defined as a reproducible low-amplitude deflection located between the end of the QRS and the onset of the T wave in leads V1–V3. Epsilon waves reflect delayed conduction in the right ventricle, and their prevalence in European and American registries varies from 0.9% to 25%. Epsilon waves may reflect short-term arrhythmic risk but have limited diagnostic utility because they are variable, have low sensitivity and specificity, and are dependent on ECG filter setting and magnification.

Moderate‐Risk Test Cohort,

A period of 15‐second resting ECG was analyzed for 1886 patients from Finland with coronary artery disease (leads I and V4) from the ARTEMIS study. Fifty‐one subjects were excluded because of no ECG at rest or poor ECG quality, leading to 1835 individuals included in the analyses (Figure 2). All enrolled patients gave informed consent, and the institutional ethics committee approved the study. The study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki.

The primary end point was SCD or resuscitation from sudden cardiac arrest, whichever occurred first. The definition for SCD was a witnessed death within 1 hour of the onset of symptoms. For unwitnessed deaths, the definition was last being seen alive and stable 24 hours before discovery. The secondary end points were cardiac death (including SCD, aborted sudden cardiac arrest, and death from a cause other than SCD [non‐SCD], whichever occurred first), non‐SCD, and all‐cause mortality. Follow‐up was 5 years.

### Clinical aspects of inherited J-wave syndromes [^1172wjVy]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Presence of J-point elevation with rapidly ascending ST segment in the anterior leads of the 12-lead electrocardiogram has been generally considered a benign phenomenon. The concept of benign nature of J-waves has changed as data emerged on variants of J-waves that were associated with the increased risk of sudden cardiac death. Two specific inherited arrhythmia syndromes, such as Brugada syndrome and early repolarization syndrome, have been recognized that carry an increased risk for ventricular fibrillation. The current review is aimed at discussing the clinical aspects of these syndromes and the implications of incidental recognition of the J-waves in a randomly recorded electrocardiogram of asymptomatic subjects.

### A novel surface electrocardiogram-based marker of ventricular arrhythmia risk in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy [^116WUN41]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2012). Low credibility.

A high-resolution 12-lead ECG describes the summation of myocyte electrical activity along specific vectors. Cardiac depolarization flows in a complex 3-dimensional wave that is influenced by static factors, such as myocardial scar, and dynamic factors that exert their influence through APD and conduction velocity restitution. The diastolic interval, which itself has a spatial gradient, affects the excitability of individual myocytes, regional conduction velocity, and also repolarization. These effects alter the depolarization wavefront, the consequence of this being dependent on whether the resulting wavelets propagate or are extinguished. In turn these effects will create spatial dispersion of repolarization and potentially discordant alternans. The R2I2 attempts to use the 12-lead ECG to measure regional manifestations of this irreducibly complex cardiac choreography. Figure 8 shows an example of regional differences in repolarization developing as the S1–S2 coupling interval shortens in a Primary Study group patient who went on to develop VA; these changes cause substantial heterogeneity in the restitution gradient and a high R2I2 (1.63).

### The electrocardiogram as a prognostic tool for predicting major cardiac events [^116eQ8EB]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Among patients with cardiac disease, the identification of those who are at low risk and those who are at high risk for major cardiac events is crucial for a rational clinical management of individual patients. A correct noninvasive risk stratification of cardiac patients, in particular, has relevant clinical implications because it would avoid unnecessary exposure to potentially risky invasive diagnostic or interventional procedures in low-risk patients, whereas it would allow an appropriate aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic approach in high-risk patients. Furthermore, the appropriate identification of low- and high-risk patients would also have social and economic implications by favoring optimization of resource distribution and costs. A large number of studies in previous decades provided evidence that several methods and variables derived from the analysis of the electrocardiogram (ECG) are powerful predictors of major cardiac events in several clinical conditions. Despite that, there has been limited attention about how several of these findings can be used in clinical practice. Furthermore, in recent years, most studies about risk stratification of cardiac patients have mainly been focused on the use of a number of serum/plasma biomarkers with reduced attention to ECG variables. Surprisingly, however, there have been few attempts to establish whether the various proposed risk markers add any significant information to that obtainable from ECG methods. In this article, the evidence for the prognostic value of variables derived from the assessment of the ECG signal by several methods and techniques will be briefly reviewed. Because of the largeness of the topic, this review will be necessarily incomplete. Because most of the clinical research in this field concerned risk stratification of patients with coronary artery disease, the article will be largely focused on this population of patients. The role of ECG methods in specific cardiac diseases and, in particular, in the general population of asymptomatic subjects will be briefly discussed when believed appropriate and helpful. Furthermore, only major clinical events (ie, cardiac death, arrhythmic events, acute myocardial infarction) will be taken into account as end points in this article. Minor clinical events (eg, coronary revascularization procedures, coronary artery restenosis, recurrences of symptoms) are indeed less robust as end points because they are widely biased by subjective judgments.

Role of screening and diagnostic viral testing in restarting electrophysiology care: Testing for COVID-19 infection is a critical tool as we embark on safely restarting elective and semi-elective procedures, and patient screening and diagnostic testing are important tools to limit patient and staff exposure. Figure 1 illustrates a model for the evolution of detectable virus and virus-specific immunoglobulin during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, but lack of widespread access to timely and accurate viral testing has been a major limitation from the onset of the pandemic and there will likely be persistent variations in regional availability of testing, greatly affecting our ability to identify infected individuals, schedule cases, prevent disease transmission, and clarify policies that will minimize the risk of restarting elective procedures.

Electrocardiographic Analyses

The admission ECG for each patient was reviewed at a core laboratory, which included 4 researchers (J. A.B. A.P. J.G. A. and R.M.L.). The reviewers were blinded to patient sex or therapy. Reliability of electrocardiographic reading was tested in 100 randomly selected electrocardiographic tracings. Before starting electrocardiographic reading, intraobserver (1 reader [J. A.B.]) and interobserver (among the 4 readers of the core laboratory) variability was assessed in 100 randomly selected tracings for the following variables: abnormal Q waves, ST‐segment elevation ≥ 0.1 mV in ≥ 2 contiguous leads (≥ 0.15 mV for V2–V3), ST‐segment depression ≥ 0.05 mV in ≥ 2 contiguous leads, and negative T waves. Agreement between pairs of observations and the κ index was used as measures of variability. During the reading period, borderline and doubtful cases (ranging from selection of the index tracing when different tracings of the same patient were provided, to diagnosis of QRS fragmentation, hemiblocks, and abnormal Q waves) were discussed with 1 of the core laboratory members (J.B.) and an agreement was reached. Intraobserver agreement for 4 major electrocardiographic findings (abnormal Q waves, ST elevation, ST depression, and T‐wave inversion) ranged between 96% and 99% (κ index, 0.89–0.98), and mean interobserver agreement for the same variables ranged between 87% and 90% (mean κ index, 0.61–0.80). We measured the magnitude of ST‐segment elevation or depression in each lead to the nearest 0.5 mm from a scanned copy of the initial ECG. We defined Q waves as pathological when they had a duration of ≥ 30 ms in ≥ 2 contiguous leads or in the presence of an R wave of ≥ 40 ms in lead V1 and an R > S amplitude in lead V2. 14 The presence of possible confounding factors, such as bundle branch block, ventricular hypertrophy, or poor ECG quality, was noted. We analyzed the following initial electrocardiographic variables: cardiac rhythm, heart rate, PR, QRS, and corrected QT interval duration, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) by Sokolow‐Lyon criteria, pathological Q waves, number of leads with ST‐segment elevation or depression, total elevation of the ST segment, total depression of the ST segment (in both cases, the summation in millimeters in all the leads affected), and negative T waves. ST‐segment elevation was measured 0.02 seconds after the J point, and ST depression was measured 0.08 seconds after the J point, in the affected leads in comparison to the T‐P segment. The infarction was considered to be anterior (leads V1–V4), inferior (II, III, and aVF), or lateral (leads I, aVL, and/or V5 and V6). Negative T waves were defined as symmetric T waves of ≥ 0.25‐mV amplitude in ≥ 2 contiguous leads with a prominent R or with R > S amplitude. In cases in which the electrocardiographic findings were complex or ambiguous, the primary reader included any comments or questions in a spreadsheet that was reviewed by other core laboratory members to reach an agreement.

Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2020). High credibility.

Viral testing platforms and retesting considerations: The test platforms now available have different advantages and limitations, including differences in turnaround time and throughput, and fortunately, false positive rates are low for established viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. However, sensitivity of PCR-based viral testing varies among platforms, and significantly variable false negative rates from available test kits have been reported, which may be compounded by sampling limitations and variation in presence of virus at different sites during the course of the disease. These considerations may prompt repeat testing when there is evidence of exposure, typical symptoms, or clinical presentation (although atypical symptom presentations are well described).

### AVR sign as a risk factor for life-threatening arrhythmic events in patients with Brugada syndrome [^112FVN1E]. Heart Rhythm (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Risk stratification in Brugada syndrome (BS) is controversial, especially in asymptomatic individuals.

Objective

The aim of this study was to evaluate the significance of lead aVR in patients with BS.

Methods

Twenty-four patients with the electrocardiogram pattern of BS (24 male, mean age 32.1 ± 13.6 years) and 24 healthy age- and gender-matched controls were studied.

Results

Thirteen patients were symptomatic. The R-wave amplitude or R/q ratio in lead aVR was significantly greater in patients experiencing a recurrence compared with those who did not. The aVR sign was defined as R wave ≥ 0.3 mV or R/q ≥ 0.75 in lead aVR. Most of the recurrences (78%) were in patients with present aVR sign; 84% of BS patients with present aVR sign had events during follow-up. In contrast, only 27% of BS patients with absent aVR sign had events during follow-up.

Conclusion

Our study shows significant correlation between a prominent R wave in lead aVR (aVR sign) and risk for development of arrhythmic events in BS. In the presence of BS, prominent R wave in lead aVR may reflect more right ventricular conduction delay and subsequently more electrical heterogeneity, which in turn is responsible for a higher risk of arrhythmia.

### Standard ECG in Brugada syndrome as a marker of prognosis: from risk stratification to pathophysiological insights [^116uxLpX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

ER Pattern

An ER pattern, defined as a J‐point elevation of at least 1 mm above the baseline terminal QRS notching in at least 2 consecutive inferior or lateral leads, is a common electrocardiographic sign in the general population, with an estimated prevalence of 1% to 5% in healthy adults. 51 In the past, it was considered a benign electrocardiographic finding, but several reports have recently suggested an association between idiopathic VF and ER in the inferior and/or lateral leads of the ECG. 52

In 2009, Sarkozy et al 32 investigated the prevalence and characteristics of spontaneous or drug‐induced inferolateral repolarization abnormalities in a large unselected population of patients with BrS. Patients with inferolateral spontaneous ER more frequently had a spontaneous type 1 ECG pattern, had a more severe phenotype, and were less likely to be asymptomatic at first presentation.

Kawata et al 33 investigated the prevalence and prognostic significance of ER in the inferolateral leads in 49 patients with BrS with documented VF and ICD implanted for secondary prevention. ER was observed persistently or intermittently in nearly half of the patients (in at least 1 but not in all ECGs). During follow‐up, recurrence of VF occurred in all patients with a persistent ER pattern, in 75% of the patients with an intermittent ER pattern, and in 44% of those without ER. The presence of either persistent or intermittent ER in an inferolateral lead was an independent predictor of fatal arrhythmic events (persistent ER: HR, 4.88; 95% CI, 2.02–12.7 [P = 0.0004]; intermittent ER: HR, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.03–6.43 [P = 0.04]).

Table 1.8.1 — Syncope in patients without structural heart disease — provides Appropriate Use Scores (A/M/R, 1–9) across specific syncope scenarios. Unexplained syncope with a structurally normal heart plus a family history of sudden death is rated R (3), whereas with a normal electrocardiogram (ECG) and structurally normal heart with no known family history of sudden death is R (1). In idiopathic ventricular tachycardia (VT) with normal left ventricle (LV)/right ventricle (RV) function/anatomy, documented sustained monomorphic VT (left bundle branch block [LBBB]/inferior axis) at the time of syncope is R (3) when ablation has not yet been attempted and R (2) when ablation has been successful. For long QT syndrome, while on treatment with beta-blockers is A (7) and not being treated with beta-blockers is M (6). For a Brugada ECG pattern, no electrophysiological study (EPS) performed is A (7) and sustained VT/ventricular fibrillation (VF) induced is A (9). For catecholaminergic polymorphic VT, not being treated with beta-blockers or flecainide is M (5). It is also stated that appropriate exercise recommendations are assumed to be followed.

### Relationship between electrocardiographic findings and cardiac magnetic resonance phenotypes in arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy [^115MDiav]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) is an inherited heart disease characterized by fibrofatty myocardial replacement, which may act as a substrate for life‐threatening ventricular arrhythmias and cause progressive ventricular systolic dysfunction. 1, 2, 3 Previously referred to as arrhythmogenic right ventricular (RV) cardiomyopathy because of the predominant involvement of the RV in the originally reported phenotype, the recognition of biventricular and left‐dominant disease variants has led, in recent years, to use of the current designation of ACM, which better reflects the broader phenotypic spectrum of the disease. 2, 3, 4, 5

Conventionally, the diagnosis of ACM relies on clinical criteria that encompass electrocardiographic repolarization and depolarization abnormalities, arrhythmic events, morphofunctional ventricular alterations, histopathologic changes, and familial genetic background. 3 A 12‐lead ECG is an integral part of the evaluation of affected patients, and depolarization/repolarization abnormalities are commonly observed, with a reported prevalence of up to 85%. 6 The most striking electrocardiographic abnormalities in patients with ACM include T‐wave inversion in anterior or anterolateral leads; prolongation of right precordial QRS duration with a delayed S‐wave upstroke (terminal activation delay, > 55 ms); QRS fragmentation and postexcitation ε waves (ie, small‐amplitude potentials occurring at the end of the QRS complex/beginning of the ST segment); and low QRS voltages in limb leads. 3, 6 The underlying structural and functional ventricular abnormalities and the clinical and prognostic meaning of these electrocardiographic abnormalities remain to be defined.

### Impaired ventricular repolarization dynamics in patients with early repolarization syndrome [^11253CuY]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Almost all current investigations on early repolarization syndrome (ERS) have focused on the J-wave characteristics and ST-segment configuration; however, few have reported on ventricular repolarization indexes in ERS.

Methods and Results

A total of 145 subjects were enrolled: 10 ERS patients, 45 uneventful ER pattern (ERP) subjects, and 90 healthy controls without J waves or ST-segment elevation. Ambulatory ECG-derived parameters (QT, QTc(B), QTc(F), T peak-Tend(Tpe), and QT/RR slope) were measured and statistically compared. Among the groups, there was no significant difference in the average QT and QTc(B); however, ERS patients had the shortest QTc(F) and longest Tpe (QTc(F): 396.2 ± 19 vs 410.4 ± 20 vs 419.2 ± 19 milliseconds, P = 0.036, Tpe: 84.9 ± 12 vs 70.4 ± 11 vs 66.9 ± 15 milliseconds, P < 0.001, for the ERS, ERP, and control groups, respectively). Importantly, the 24-hour QT/RR slope was significantly smaller in the ERS than ERP and control groups (QT/RR: 0.105 ± 0.01 vs 0.154 ± 0.02 vs 0.161 ± 0.03, respectively; P < 0.001). When analyzing the diurnal and nocturnal QT/RR slopes, ERS patients had small diurnal and nocturnal QT/RR slopes while the ERP and control groups had large diurnal and small nocturnal QT/RR slopes (diurnal QT/RR: 0. 077 ± 0.01 vs 0.132 ± 0.03 vs 0.143 ± 0.03, P < 0.001; nocturnal QT/RR: 0.093 ± 0.02 vs 0.129 ± 0.03 vs 0.130 ± 0.04, P = 0.02 in the ERS, ERP, and control groups, respectively).

Conclusion

ERS patients had a continuously depressed diurnal and nocturnal adaptation of the QT interval to the heart rate. Such abnormal repolarization dynamics might provide a substrate for reentry and be an important element for developing ventricular fibrillation in the ERS cohort.

### ECG clues for diagnosing ventricular tachycardia mechanism [^115xCNcq]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2008). Low credibility.

Three mechanisms underlie the initiation and maintenance of ventricular tachycardia: automaticity, triggered activity, and reentry. As straightforward as these mechanisms are, assessing which mechanism is operative in a particular patient's ventricular tachycardia can be difficult. The optimal treatment strategy for ventricular tachycardia in a given patient can be influenced by the mechanism underlying the ventricular tachycardia. Appropriately counseling patients, choosing the optimal pharmacologic agent that maximizes efficacy while minimizing undesirable side effects, risks, and toxicities, as well as recommending and timing ablative therapy all hinge on identifying the probable mechanism of ventricular tachycardia. Much has been published regarding invasive electrophysiologic maneuvers that allow for correct diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia mechanism. The aim of this clinical review is to provide insight into VT mechanisms based on ECG clues of spontaneous arrhythmia events and the response to pharmacologic manipulation prior to invasive electrophysiologic evaluation.

### Fragmented QRS complex predicts contrast-induced nephropathy and in-hospital mortality after primary percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^116kjWLL]. Clinical Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is associated with increased mortality after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Recently, fragmented QRS complex (fQRS) on 12-lead electrocardiography has been introduced as a marker of cardiovascular disease and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality.

Hypothesis

fQRS on ECG is associated with CIN and in-hospital mortality after primary PCI in patients with STEMI.

Methods

Eight hundred ninety-five patients with first STEMI treated by primary PCI were enrolled in the study. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to the presence or absence of fQRS as shown by 12-lead electrocardiography in the first 24 hours. fQRS was defined by presence of an additional R wave (R″), or notching of the S wave, or > 1 R' in 2 contiguous leads. Patients were then reallocated to 2 groups according to presence or absence of postprocedural CIN, which was defined as a rise in serum creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL or a 25% increase from baseline value within 72 hours after the procedure.

Results

Patients with a fQRS were older and had significantly lower left ventricular ejection fraction. CIN occurred in 77 (8.6%) patients. The prevalence of CIN and in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in the fQRS(+) group. In multivariate analysis, fQRS was found to be an independent predictor of CIN (odds ratio: 3.125, P = 0.029) and in-hospital mortality (odds ratio: 9.062, P = 0.009).

Conclusions

The fQRS is an independent predictor of postprocedural CIN and in-hospital mortality in STEMI patients.

Criteria Used to Recognize STE‐ECGs

Since the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology STEMI thresholds slightly differ, ECGs were classified twice by applying 2 sets of thresholds on the J‐point amplitudes 2, 10:
Sex‐specific STEMI thresholds: 2013 American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association STEMI guidelines 1 (lead V2‐V3 ≥ 0.2 mV [men], ≥ 0.15 mV [women], other leads ≥ 0.1 mV).
Age‐ and sex‐specific STEMI thresholds: 2017 European Society of Cardiology STEMI guidelines 2 (lead V2‐V3 ≥ 0.25 mV [men < 40 years], ≥ 0.20 mV [men ≥ 40 years], ≥ 0.15 mV [women], other leads ≥ 0.1 mV).

Exclusion Criteria

Subjects were excluded when questionnaires were incomplete or no ECG of sufficient quality was recorded. To allow statistically meaningful analyses, only ethnicities with a sufficient number of subjects were included, resulting in subgroups of African Surinamese (South American with African roots), Dutch (Western Europe), Ghanaian (Western Africa), Moroccan (Northern Africa), South Asian Surinamese (South Asia), and Turkish (Middle East) ethnic origin (Figure S1). Figure 1 depicts the exclusion process for establishing an apparently healthy population based on clinical diagnoses, medication, and ECG characteristics.

Academic guideline recommendations on electrocardiographic screening

The use of electrocardiography to screen asymptomatic adults for cardiovascular disease is controversial. Although electrocardiographic screening is safe, it could "lead to higher downstream cardiac testing use, more specialist consultations, and potentially higher rates of adverse events, including excess radiation exposure and procedural complications of angiography". Therefore, the United States Preventive Services Task Force suggests not to use electrocardiographic screening in patients at low risk of cardiovascular disease (10 year event risk of less than 10%). In patients with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, the Task Force cited that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of electrocardiographic screening. However, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline considered electrocardiographic screening to be "reasonable" in asymptomatic people with hypertension or diabetes and that it "may be considered" in those without hypertension or diabetes. The 2019 European Society of Cardiology guidelines on diabetes, prediabetes, and cardiovascular diseases stated that "resting ECG is recommended in patients with diabetes mellitus with hypertension or suspected cardiovascular disease". However, both these guidelines acknowledged the lack of data to support this expert consensus (level of evidence C). Therefore, the robust evidence in the current study, which showed that UMI-ECG was associated with adverse outcomes, supports developing strategies for screening and preventing cardiovascular disease in high risk patients. However, limited data showed that electrocardiography can add additional predictive values for mortality and new myocardial infarction, and the results were inconsistent. These inconsistencies could arise from the fact that most of the studies included patients with a low risk of cardiovascular disease. In this context, further studies are needed to evaluate the impact of electrocardiography on incremental improvements in risk stratification in high risk patients.

A large scale registry study from Spain showed that although the positive predictive value of asymptomatic Q waves for diagnosing unrecognised myocardial infarction was 29.2% overall, it was much higher (75%) in participants with a 10 year coronary heart disease risk of at least 10% than in lower risk participants. Therefore, we agree with the proposal in the Canadian diabetes guideline that electrocardiographic screening should be performed in patients with a high risk of cardiovascular disease. This screening gives information on baseline cardiac ischaemia and can also provide information for comparison with future electrocardiographic data. A repeat resting electrocardiogram might detect changes that result from unrecognised myocardial infarction, leading to earlier detection of critical cardiovascular disease.

### Type-I paradox of Brugada syndrome [^112bYVV1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The study by Ueoka et al 6 provides limited insight into this intriguing second possibility. There were 105 patients with a nondiagnostic ECG at the time of the SCB test. Of the 85 patients with a positive SCB test, roughly half had documentation of a spontaneous type‐I ECG. All the arrhythmic events, including the arrhythmias provoked by the test and the few spontaneous arrhythmias taking place during follow‐up, occurred in this group. The numbers of arrhythmic events, however, are too small to reach any valid conclusions, and studies looking at the prognosis of patients with drug‐induced type‐I who never have a spontaneous type‐I ECG are urgently needed.

### QRS fragmentation does not predict mortality in survivors of acute myocardial infarction [^112dr3AF]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

2.3 ECG analysis

Resting 12‐lead ECGs were recorded during the index hospitalization at a standard printing speed of 50 mm/s and an amplitude of 10 mm/mV. The ECG analysis including the detection of fragmented QRS complexes was performed independently by two experienced physicians, who were blinded to all follow‐up data. The results of both interpreters were then compared. There was 99% concordance for the detection of fragmented QRS complexes between both readers. In case of disagreement, a third independent interpreter was consulted, and a mutual consent was found.

The fragmented QRS pattern in narrow QRS complexes (< 120 ms) comprises different morphologies including the presence of one or multiple additional R waves (R′) or notches in two contiguous leads corresponding to a major coronary artery territory (anterior, lateral, and inferior wall),(Figure 1).

2.4 Statistical analysis

The distribution of continuous variables is presented as medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs). Categorical variables are presented as absolute and relative frequencies. Hypothesis tests for group differences of continuous variables were performed by Mann–Whitney U tests. Hypothesis tests for group differences of categorical variables were performed by χ 2 tests. Median follow‐up was estimated by the reverse Kaplan–Meier method. Univariable Cox proportional hazard models were used for effect estimation by hazard ratios (HRs) and hypothesis testing by z tests for the association of variables and right‐censored outcome measures. Precision of estimates was described by 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). All hypothesis tests were two‐sided and performed at 5% significance levels. Survival curves were generated by the Kaplan–Meier method. Analyses were performed in IBM SPSS Statistics, version 28 (IBM Corp) and in R 3.6.1 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing).

### Ranolazine [^111oeKja]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

What should I avoid while taking r anolazine extended-release tablets?

Grapefruit and grapefruit juice. Limit products that have grapefruit in them. They can cause your blood levels of ranolazine extended-release tablets to increase.
Ranolazine extended-release tablets can cause dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting. If you have these symptoms, do not drive a car, use machinery, or do anything that needs you to be alert.

What are the possible side effects of r anolazine extended-release tablets?

Ranolazine extended-release tablets may cause serious side effects, including:

changes in the electrical activity of your heart called QT prolongation. Your doctor may check the electrical activity of your heart with an ECG. Tell your doctor right away if you feel faint, lightheaded, or feel your heart beating irregularly or fast while taking ranolazine extended-release tablets. These may be symptoms related to QT prolongation.
kidney failure in people who already have severe kidney problems. Your doctor may need to do tests to check how your kidneys are working.

The most common side effects of ranolazine extended-release tablets include:

dizziness
headache
constipation
nausea

Tell your doctor if you have any side effect that bothers you or does not go away. These are not all the possible side effects of ranolazine extended-release tablets. For more information, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

### Characterisation of patients who develop atrial fibrillation-induced cardiomyopathy [^116j9q8U]. Open Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Figure 6
Longitudinal strain analysis on apical views of the left ventricle during transthoracic echocardiography in a participant with atrial fibrillation-induced cardiomyopathy after the restoration of normal sinus rhythm and normalisation of left ventricular ejection fraction 6 months after catheter ablation. The strain values demonstrate impaired longitudinal systolic function with relative apical sparing. HR, heart rate.

Abnormal LV strain is associated with early chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy and forewarns subsequent LVEF reduction. Some patients with these features may be in an indolent phase of mild subclinical cardiomyopathy, which increases vulnerability to AF. This precedent cardiomyopathic process may help explain the chicken and egg debate when co-diagnosed together. Alternatively, this could be a more independent process that decompensates after an incident unrelated to AF has reduced the LVEF.

No significant demographic differences were seen in limited comparison with patients who retained a normal LVEF in persistent AF. A difference in the burden of short R-R intervals was seen despite apparent rate control and a similar mean HR. There may be inherent differences in rhythm-level characteristics between patients in AF. AF results in an intrinsically higher ventricular rate than sinus rhythm, and rate control medications are used to address any tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy phenomenon. Achieving rate control at baseline can mitigate any significant incremental rate control achieved by restoring sinus rhythm. There is no significant difference in reverse remodelling in permanent AF from lenient rate control (mean HR 80–110 bpm) versus strict rate control (mean HR < 80 bpm). The threshold for lenient rate control is recommended by contemporary guidelines and was used in our study at enrolment. However, the deleterious effect of tachycardia is more likely to be a spectrum than dichotomised around 110 bpm, and measuring the short R-R interval burden may improve the characterisation of the burden of tachycardia given the non-parametric R-R interval distribution during AF. AIC is likely a complex phenomenon and may result from a combination of rhythm and structural features. A double-hit hypothesis wherein the onset of AF with a high short R-R interval burden in a patient with vulnerable cardiomyopathic features can be speculated as the reason for AF-induced cardiac dysfunction in those patients who develop LVEF reduction during rate-controlled AF adjudicated by the mean HR.

### Specific pharmacological profile of AAdenosine receptor predicts reduced fractional flow reserve in patients with suspected coronary artery disease [^115LcGPQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The rapid and reliable exclusion of myocardial revascularization is a major unmet clinical need in patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) and non-contributive electrocardiography and troponin. Non-invasive tests have high rates of false positives and negatives, and there is no biomarker to assess myocardial ischemia. The presence of spare adenosine A 2A receptors (A 2 A R)-characterized by a high dissociation constant/half maximal effective concentration (K D /EC 50) ratio-expressed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) has been associated with ischemia during exercise stress testing in patients with CAD. In this work, we investigated the diagnostic accuracy of spare A 2 A R versus fractional flow reserve (FFR) in patients with suspected CAD.

Methods and Results

Sixty patients with suspected CAD, but non-contributive electrocardiography and troponin, were consecutively enrolled in this prospective study. The binding (K D), functional response (cyclic adenosine monophosphate [cAMP] production; EC 50) on PBMC A 2 A R were compared with FFR results. Patients were divided into 3 groups: 17 (group 1) with normal coronary angiography (n = 13) or stenosis < 20% (n = 4); 21 with CAD and non-significant FFR (group 2); and 22 with CAD and significant FFR (group 3). Median K D /EC 50 was 6-fold higher in group 3 (4.20; interquartile range: 2.81–5.00) than group 2 (0.66; interquartile range: 0.47–1.25) and 7-fold higher than group 1 (0.60; interquartile range: 0.30–0.66).

Conclusions

In patients with suspected CAD and non-contributive electrocardiography and troponin, the absence of spare A 2 A R on PBMC may help to rule out myocardial ischemia.

RM alerts practitioners to changes in lead or device function that would otherwise go undetected until the next scheduled IPE or RI, which can sometimes take place months after the change, and trends in lead impedances, mode switch events, ventricular arrhythmias, and R-wave and P-wave amplitudes can presage device and non-device problems before they manifest clinically.

### Incidence, determinants, and prognostic value of reverse left ventricular remodelling after primary percutaneous coronary intervention: results of the acute myocardial infarction contrast imaging (AMICI) multicenter study [^113qGZ9t]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Previous studies

Ventricular enlargement after myocardial infarction is an adaptive compensatory mechanism to maintain stroke volume after the loss of contractile function. Several studies show that the extent of subsequent LV volume enlargement reflects the magnitude of the primary microvascular damage. Conversely, little information is available on the incidence, determinants, and clinical significance of r-LVR after STEMI. Previous large multicentre trials showed that pharmaceutical agents, including ACE inhibitors and β-blockers, attenuate rather than reverse LVR, with a few notable exceptions. – The GISSI 3 study showed for the first time a significant LV volume reduction after myocardial infarction. However, determinants and clinical significance of this phenomenon were not described. The SAVE studyand most recently the VALIANT and the CAPRICORN studies, demonstrated the linkage between attenuation of LV enlargement by captopril, valsartan, or carvedilol after infarction and improved clinical outcomes. Recently, it has been demonstrated that r-LVR may occur after coronary revascularization in patients with ischaemic cardiomyopathyor even after late reopening of an occluded IRAand is closely related to the extent of viable myocardium in the infarct zone. Similarly, a significant correlation was found between total scar burden at baseline and r-LVR after 6 months of CRT in patients with ischaemic cardiomyopathy. The total scar burden as detected by MCE is an independent predictor of long-term hard cardiac events in patients after AMI. Accordingly, our study showed that an effective microvascular reflow within the infarct zone soon after reperfusion is a key determinant of r-LVR and of long-term event-free survival. However, independently of dysfunctioning area soon after IRA reopening, the improvement of microvascular perfusion in the first week after hospital admission is a strong predictor of r-LVR at follow-up. In patients with r-LVR, a significant recovery of microvascular flow was detected during the first week after STEMI (ΔCDL –38%). Similar improvement in microvascular flow after reperfusion has been previously reported. Although there are no definitive explanations for this phenomenon, we can postulate that it might be the result of resolution of potentially reversible mechanisms of microvascular obstruction such as arteriolar spasm, tissue oedema, and cellular plugging. The improvement in microvascular flow may also be related to spontaneous angiogenesis occurring in the first week after reperfusion. An up-regulation of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) known to be involved in vasculogenesis has been recently detected in the first week after primary stenting. The EPCs mobilized after AMI may contribute to new vessel generation and are closely related to a greater increase in myocardial salvage, decrease in LVESV, and recovery of LVEF.

Class IIa, LOE B-R: In symptomatic patients with SND who have dual chamber pacemakers and intact atrioventricular conduction, it is reasonable to program the dual chamber pacemaker to minimize ventricular pacing. Class IIa, LOE C-EO: In symptomatic patients with SND in which frequent ventricular pacing is not expected or the patient has significant comorbidities that are otherwise likely to determine the survival and clinical outcomes, single chamber ventricular pacing is reasonable.

### Rhythm and conduction analysis of patients with acute rheumatic fever [^111V1DdG]. Pediatric Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Various rhythm and conduction abnormalities can develop in acute rheumatic fever. This study investigated rhythm and conduction abnormalities in children with acute rheumatic fever using a standard 12-lead electrocardiogram and 24-h rhythm Holter recordings. This multicenter retrospective study, performed between August 2011 and March 2012, enrolled 73 consecutive children with acute rheumatic fever. Standard electrocardiography was used to measure PR and corrected QT intervals. Holter recordings were evaluated for all the patients, and 52 of the patients (71.2%) had carditis that was either isolated or together with other major criteria. A positive correlation was detected between carditis and the mean PR interval on standard electrocardiography, but this was not significant (p > 0.05). Standard electrocardiography showed a significant positive correlation between PR and corrected QT intervals (p = 0.03; r = 0.55). Standard electrocardiography showed only three patients (4.2%) with premature contractions, whereas 24-h electrocardiography showed 26 patients (35.6%) with premature contractions. Carditis was positively correlated with premature contractions (p < 0.01; r = 0.57). One patient with junctional rhythm and one patient with left bundle block were detected by standard electrocardiography. Whereas some patients with carditis exhibited no arrhythmic evidence on standard electrocardiograms, complete atrioventricular block, supraventricular tachycardia, and Mobitz type 1 block were observed on 24-h Holter recordings. A positive correlation also was observed between the presence of premature contractions and serum levels of acute-phase reactants (p = 0.03; r = 0.62). These findings led to the conclusion that rhythm and conduction disorders in acute rheumatic fever are more common than previously thought.

### Disposition and pharmacologic effects of R / S-verapamil in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation: an investigation comparing single and multiple dosing [^116yRF7p]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Racemic (R /S)- verapamil is widely used in the management of chronic atrial fibrillation. The negative dromotropic effect is mainly mediated by the S -enantiomer, which is preferentially metabolized. Previous studies report an accumulation of R /S- verapamil during long-term oral treatment of patients with chronic atrial fibrillation. However, the specific disposition of S -verapamil and the pharmacologic effects were not assessed. Therefore uncertainties about the need for dose adjustments remain.

Methods

Using stable isotope technology and a stereospecific assay, we compared the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of intravenous (10 mg of d(7)-R /S -verapamil) and oral (240 mg of slow release (SR) d(0)-R /S -verapamil) R -verapamil and S -verapamil after the first dose (day 1) and after 3 weeks (day 21) of continuous oral therapy in 8 patients with long-term atrial fibrillation. On both study days, serum samples were obtained for the analysis of d(7)- and d(0)-R -verapamil and S -verapamil. Heart rate (HR) was monitored with electrocardiography (with each blood sample) and Holter electrocardiography (before the study, on day 1, and on day 21).

Results

Compared with day 1, clearance of oral R -verapamil and S -verapamil was significantly reduced on day 21 (1007 ± 380 versus 651 ± 253 mL/min [-35%] and 5481 ± 2731 versus 2855 ± 1097 mL/min [-48%], respectively; P < .05), whereas only a moderate decrease was observed for intravenous R -verapamil and S -verapamil (-23% and -14%, respectively, not significant). Mean HR (89 ± 11 bpm before verapamil) was effectively reduced, with the same effects on day 1 (68 ± 8 bpm) and day 21 (68 ± 8 bpm). Compared with day 1, the HR reduction per ng/mL of S -verapamil (calculated by the area under the curve [from 0–24 hours] ratio of HR reduction and S -verapamil concentration) was significantly lower on day 21 (0.7 ± 0.4 versus 1.2 ± 0.7 [bpm] [ng/mL](-1), for day 21 versus day 1; P < .01).

Conclusions

In patients with chronic atrial fibrillation, clearance of oral, but not intravenous, S -verapamil and R -verapamil is significantly reduced with multiple doses compared with a single dose, thereby indicating predominant impairment of prehepatic rather than hepatic metabolism as the underlying mechanism. However, this kinetic change is clinically compensated by a decrease in the responsiveness to S -verapamil observed with regular dosing. The data suggest that despite accumulation of the drug individual verapamil doses can be maintained during long-term oral rate control therapy.

Electroencephalographic reactivity (EEG-R) is a promising early predictor of arousal in comatose patients after cardiac arrest. Despite recent guidelines advocating for the integration of EEG-R into the multimodal prognostication model, EEG-R testing methods remain heterogeneous across studies. While efforts towards standardization have been made to reduce interrater variability by the development of quantitative approaches and machine learning models, future validation studies are needed to increase clinical applicability. Furthermore, the specific neurophysiological mechanisms and neuroanatomical correlates underlying EEG-R are not fully understood. In this narrative review, we explore the value and possible mechanisms of EEG-R, focusing on post-cardiac arrest comatose patients. We aim to discuss the current standard of knowledge and future directions, as well as elucidate possible implications for patient care and research.

Clinically significant adverse reactions that appear in other sections of the labeling include:

Atrial Fibrillation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
Bradycardia and Conduction Disturbances [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]

6.1 		 	Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Adult Patients with Heart Failure

In SHIFT, safety was evaluated in 3,260 patients treated with Corlanor and 3,278 patients given placebo. The median duration of Corlanor exposure was 21.5 months.

The most common adverse drug reactions in the SHIFT trial are shown in Table 2 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), (5.3)].

Luminous P henomena (Phosphenes)

Phosphenes are phenomena described as a transiently enhanced brightness in a limited area of the visual field, halos, image decomposition (stroboscopic or kaleidoscopic effects), colored bright lights, or multiple images (retinal persistency). Phosphenes are usually triggered by sudden variations in light intensity. Corlanor can cause phosphenes, thought to be mediated through Corlanor's effects on retinal photoreceptors [see Clinical Ph a rmacology (12.1)]. Onset is generally within the first 2 months of treatment, after which they may occur repeatedly. Phosphenes were generally reported to be of mild to moderate intensity and led to treatment discontinuation in < 1% of patients; most resolved during or after treatment.

Pediatric Patients with Heart Failure

The safety of Corlanor in pediatric patients 6 months to less than 18 years of age is based on a clinical trial [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] in symptomatic heart failure patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and elevated heart rate. This trial provides experience in 73 patients treated with Corlanor for a median duration of 397 days, and 42 patients given placebo. Bradycardia (symptomatic and asymptomatic) occurred at rates similar to those in adults. Phosphenes were observed in pediatric patients treated with Corlanor.

### Dofetilide 0.125mg [^113d815D]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Ventricular Arrhythmia: Dofetilide can cause serious ventricular arrhythmias, primarily Torsade de Pointes (TdP) type ventricular tachycardia, a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia associated with QT interval prolongation. QT interval prolongation is directly related to dofetilide plasma concentration. Factors such as reduced creatinine clearance or certain dofetilide drug interactions will increase dofetilide plasma concentration. The risk of TdP can be reduced by controlling the plasma concentration through adjustment of the initial dofetilide dose according to creatinine clearance and by monitoring the ECG for excessive increases in the QT interval.

Treatment with dofetilide must therefore be started only in patients placed for a minimum of three days in a facility that can provide electrocardiographic monitoring and in the presence of personnel trained in the management of serious ventricular arrhythmias. Calculation of the creatinine clearance for all patients must precede administration of the first dose of dofetilide. For detailed instructions regarding dose selection, see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.

The risk of dofetilide induced ventricular arrhythmia was assessed in three ways in clinical studies: 1) by description of the QT interval and its relation to the dose and plasma concentration of dofetilide; 2) by observing the frequency of TdP in dofetilide-treated patients according to dose; 3) by observing the overall mortality rate in patients with atrial fibrillation and in patients with structural heart disease.

### Rufinamide [^117KxQAT]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 QT Shortening

Formal cardiac ECG studies demonstrated shortening of the QT interval (mean = 20 msec, for doses ≥ 2,400 mg twice daily) with rufinamide. In a placebo-controlled study of the QT interval, a higher percentage of rufinamide-treated subjects (46% at 2,400 mg, 46% at 3,200 mg, and 65% at 4,800 mg) had a QT shortening of greater than 20 msec at Tmaxcompared to placebo (5 to 10%).

Reductions of the QT interval below 300 msec were not observed in the formal QT studies with doses up to 7,200 mg per day. Moreover, there was no signal for drug-induced sudden death or ventricular arrhythmias.

The degree of QT shortening induced by rufinamide is without any known clinical risk. Familial Short QT syndrome is associated with an increased risk of sudden death and ventricular arrhythmias, particularly ventricular fibrillation. Such events in this syndrome are believed to occur primarily when the corrected QT interval falls below 300 msec. Non-clinical data also indicate that QT shortening is associated with ventricular fibrillation.

Patients with Familial Short QT syndrome should not be treated with rufinamide. Caution should be used when administering rufinamide with other drugs that shorten the QT interval [see Contraindications (4)].

### Heterogeneous response of J-wave syndromes to β-adrenergic stimulation [^1158b2tE]. Heart Rhythm (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Inferolateral early repolarization (ER) and Brugada syndrome manifest with J waves. Isoproterenol suppresses recurrent ventricular arrhythmias while reducing J waves in both disorders.

Objective

To characterize the effect of isoproterenol on J waves.

Methods

We analyzed the impact of isoproterenol on J waves in 20 patients with Brugada-type electrocardiogram (Br group) and 38 patients with ER (ER group).

Results

In the ER group, J waves were present in inferior leads in 32 patients (84%) and in lateral leads in 23 patients (61%). Isoproterenol increased the heart rate by 75 beats/min in the ER group and by 71 beats/min in the Br group (P = 0.20). The incidences of persistent (≤ 0.05-mV decrease), decreased, and normalized J waves (residual J wave ≤ 0.05 mV) were 20%, 80%, and 0% for Br group patients and 29%, 8%, and 63% for ER group patients, respectively (P < .001). Within the ER group, inferior J waves persisted in 34% of the cases, decreased in 9%, and normalized in 56% whereas lateral J waves always normalized (P < .001). Baseline QRS width was broader in ER group patients with persistent J waves (90 ms vs 80 ms; p = 0.003) and was unchanged with isoproterenol (90 ms; p = 0.19), whereas it decreased in the remaining patients (75 ms; P < .001).

Conclusions

J-wave syndromes have distinct regional sensitivity to beta-adrenergic stimulation. J waves may persist in a subset of patients with right precordial and inferior J waves but never in lateral location. This heterogeneous response to isoproterenol may indicate distinctive mechanisms for Brugada and ER patterns, including depolarization abnormalities or ion channel sensitivity.

Echocardiography.

All patients had a normal left ventricular ejection fraction. CAN status had no significant impact on left ventricular systolic function as measured by conventional echocardiography, but TDI measures of longitudinal systolic function (s′) were significantly lower in +CAN than in −CAN (Table 3).

TABLE 3
Echocardiography findings

TDI measures of left ventricular diastolic function indicated higher filling pressures (E-to-e′ ratio) and impaired diastolic performance according to both e′ and e′-to-a′ ratio in +CAN compared with −CAN, whereas the eas index was not significantly different in the two groups (Table 3).

Ambulatory blood pressure measurements.

Patients +CAN had higher SBP and lower DBP but mean arterial blood pressure similar to that in −CAN patients. Accordingly, the pulse pressure was significantly higher in patients +CAN compared with that in −CAN patients (Table 4).

TABLE 4
Twenty-four-hour blood pressure and Holter measurements

The nocturnal drop in blood pressure was lower in +CAN patients compared with that in −CAN patients with respect to both SBP and DBP. The number of patients with abnormal dipping was significantly higher in +CAN patients compared with −CAN patients.

Ambulatory electrocardiography.

Mean 24-h heart rate was independent of CAN status, but the maximal increase and decrease in heart rate were lower in +CAN compared with −CAN patients (Table 4).

The total number of ventricular extrasystoles (VES) was significantly higher in +CAN compared with −CAN patients. The majority of the VES were isolated, and the overall prevalence of consecutive VES was low and without difference between the groups. The number of patients having > 30 VES/h, which has been defined as frequent, were not significantly higher in +CAN than in the −CAN patients.

In the time domain analysis of HRV patients +CAN compared with −CAN had significantly lower SD of R-R intervals during a 22-h period (median 99 [range 47–185] vs. 152 [99–208], P = 0.0005) as well as SD of the average R-R interval in all 5-min recordings and mean of the SD of all filtered R-R intervals for all 5-min segments over 22 h (data not shown).

### Hemodynamic responses to speech and music in newborn infants [^113EDWZr]. Human Brain Mapping (2010). Low credibility.

We used near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to study responses to speech and music on the auditory cortices of 13 healthy full-term newborn infants during natural sleep. The purpose of the study was to investigate the lateralization of speech and music responses at this stage of development. NIRS data was recorded from eight positions on both hemispheres simultaneously with electroencephalography, electrooculography, electrocardiography, pulse oximetry, and inclinometry. In 11 subjects, statistically significant (P < 0.02) oxygenated (HbO2) and total hemoglobin (HbT) responses were recorded. Both stimulus types elicited significant HbO2 and HbT responses on both hemispheres in five subjects. Six of the 11 subjects had positive HbO2 and HbT responses to both stimulus types, whereas one subject had negative responses. Mixed positive and negative responses were observed in four neonates. On both hemispheres, speech and music responses were significantly correlated (r = 0.64; P = 0.018 on the left hemisphere (LH) and r = 0.60; P = 0.029 on the right hemisphere (RH)). On the group level, the average response to the speech stimuli was statistically significantly greater than zero in the LH, whereas responses on the RH or to the music stimuli did not differ significantly from zero. This suggests a more coherent response to speech on the LH. However, significant differences in lateralization of the responses or mean response amplitudes of the two stimulus types were not observed on the group level.

### Current epidemic trends (based on Rₜ) for States… [^114Sxpbj]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods Rₜ is defined as the average number of new infections caused by each infected person at a particular time, t. When Rₜ > 1, infections are growing, and when Rₜ < 1, infections are declining. The color categories in the maps above were determined by estimating a distribution of possible. Rₜ, while adjusting for delays and reporting effects.
- If > 90% of the credible interval distribution of Rₜ > 1, infections are growing
- If 76%-90% of the credible interval distribution of Rₜ > 1, infections are likely growing
- If 26%-75% of the credible interval distribution of. Rₜ > 1, infections are not changing
- If 10%-25% of the credible interval distribution of Rₜ > 1, infections are likely declining; this is equivalent to 75%-90% of the credible interval of Rₜ ≤ 1.
- If < 10% of the credible interval distribution of Rₜ > 1, infections are declining; this is equivalent to > 90% of the credible interval of Rₜ ≤ 1
- The data used to estimate. To estimate Rₜ, we fit Bayesian models to the data using the R packages EpiNow2, epinowcast, or using Stan models developed by the CDC Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics. Following best practices, these models adjust for lags from infection to observation, incomplete observation of recent infection events, and day-of-week reporting effects, in addition to uncertainty from all these adjustments. Glossary of terms Generation interval: the interval between the infection times of an infector-infectee pair; i.e. the difference in the time when an individual is infected by an infector and the time when this infector was infected. Leading indicator: a variable that provides an early indication of future trends in an outbreak, e.g. Rₜ, as this metric estimates the number of infections caused by one infected person in near real-time. Lagging indicator: a variable that provides a lagged indication of future trends in an outbreak, e.g. COVID-19 deaths, as this outcome happens after cases have occurred.

### Learning R: R and RStudio-R introductory series… [^113eBBg5]. bioinformatics.ccr.cancer.gov (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction to R and RStudio Learning Objectives To understand:

1. the difference between R and RStudioIDE.
2. **how to work within the RStudio environment including**:

- creating an Rproject and Rscript
- navigating between directories
- using functions obtaining help how R can enhance data analysis reproducibility By the end of this section, you should be able to easily navigate and explore your RStudio environment. What is R. R is both a computational language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is open-source and widely used by scientists, not just bioinformaticians. Base packages of R are built into your initial installation, but R functionality is greatly improved by installing other packages. R as a programming language is based on the S language, developed by Bell laboratories. R is maintained by a network of collaborators from around the world, and core contributors are known as the. Why R.

R is a particularly great resource for statistical analyses, plotting, and report generating. The fact that it is widely used means that users do not need to reinvent the wheel. There is a package available for most types of analyses, and if users need help, it is only a Google search away. As of now, CRAN houses +20, 000 available packages. Ways to run R R can be used via command line interactively, command line using a script, or interactively through an environment. This course will demonstrate the utility of the RStudio integrated development environment. What is RStudio. RStudio is an integrated development environment for R, and now python. RStudio includes a console, editor, and tools for plotting, history, debugging, and work space management. It provides a graphic user interface for working with R, thereby making R more user friendly. RStudio is open-source and can be installed locally or used through a browser.

We will be showcasing RStudio Server, but we highly encourage new users to install R and RStudio locally to their PC or macbook. Using functions A function in R is a short program that takes some input and returns some output. An R function has three key properties:

- Functions have a name; note that functions are case sensitive.
- Following the name, functions have a pair of
- Inside the parentheses, a function may take 0 or more arguments --- datacarpentry. org.
