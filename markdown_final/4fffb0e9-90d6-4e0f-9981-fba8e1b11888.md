Acupressure vecttor therapy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the evidence for acupressure across pain, nausea, fatigue, and related contexts. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the terminology and scope of acupressure versus related modalities. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence by condition, starting with cancer pain, then low back pain, then nausea and vomiting, and finally fatigue and dyspnea. Next, I will examine mechanistic plausibility and safety. After that, I should review guideline positions and implementation considerations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, cautious clinical recommendation and highlight research gaps, making sure I double-check areas where evidence is mixed or heterogeneity is high.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate interventions. Acupressure is a noninvasive manual therapy that applies pressure to specific acupoints, distinct from acupuncture (needle insertion) and from general massage therapy, although some evidence syntheses categorize acupressure under massage or manual therapy, which can blur boundaries and complicate interpretation. I need to keep that in mind when weighing heterogeneity and comparators in trials and reviews [^116XX5SH] [^115smRVH].

> Now, I will examine cancer pain, where the signal looks strongest. Multiple high-quality meta-analyses show that acupuncture and/or acupressure are associated with clinically meaningful reductions in pain intensity versus sham or usual care, with moderate-level evidence and additional signals for reduced opioid consumption when integrated with analgesic therapy. Effect sizes around −1.3 to −1.4 points on 0–10 scales are typical, and subgroup analyses suggest larger effects in moderate-to-severe pain and with auricular approaches, though heterogeneity is substantial and publication bias cannot be fully excluded [^113AhoGj] [^1147errq] [^1146d5Di] [^115hsvQA] [^1161JYbm]. Wait, let me verify the network meta-analysis signal too; a 2025 Bayesian network meta-analysis of 37 RCTs in cancer pain supports auricular acupuncture and auricular acupressure among the top-performing nonpharmacologic options, reinforcing the potential role of auricular techniques in oncology pain management, albeit with methodological caveats [^114saKgk].

> Next, I should review low back pain, where evidence is mixed and I need to be careful not to overstate. Two Taiwanese RCTs suggested acupressure outperformed usual-care physical therapy on pain and disability with sustained benefits at 6 months, but these studies had the same provider and limited external validity, so replication is needed before generalizing. Conversely, contemporary spine guidelines rate evidence as insufficient to recommend acupressure over standardized multimodal physical therapy, and VA/DoD guidance does not endorse auricular acupressure for chronic low back pain, underscoring uncertainty and the need for higher-quality multicenter trials [^117Garn2] [^111bVoC5] [^113vDaTL] [^113m33rN] [^112Qu5PL] [^115up8Qd]. Hold on, I should verify that the positive RCTs are the same studies; yes, both favorable reports derive from the same investigator group, which strengthens the concern about reproducibility [^113vDaTL].

> I will now examine nausea and vomiting, where the signal is condition-specific and modality-dependent. For chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, older guidelines and reviews suggested benefit when added to antiemetics, but more recent oncology antiemetic guidelines conclude evidence is insufficient for routine recommendation of acupressure or auricular acupressure, reflecting heterogeneity, small trials, and evolving standards. Nonetheless, PC6 wristband acupressure has FDA Class I clearance for nausea relief in motion sickness, pregnancy, anesthesia, and chemotherapy, and a 2025 Cochrane network meta-analysis indicates that PC6 stimulation (invasive or noninvasive) can reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting and rescue antiemetic use, supporting a role as an adjunct when antiemetics are inadequate [^115EazEK] [^114hSMfx] [^112sEDc4] [^113yvm6p] [^115SoFLs] [^1129KfJU]. Wait, I should double-check the nuance here. The oncology antiemetic guidelines' "insufficient evidence" stance does not negate potential benefit, it just means routine endorsement is premature pending higher-quality trials, so shared decision-making is reasonable in select patients [^notfound].

> Let me consider fatigue next, because this is an area where a single rigorous trial shifted practice. A phase III RCT in breast cancer survivors showed both relaxing and stimulating self-acupressure significantly improved cancer-related fatigue versus usual care at 6 and 10 weeks, with about 34% and 27% reductions respectively; ASCO-SIO now issues a conditional recommendation for acupressure in post-treatment fatigue, acknowledging single-trial evidence and the need for broader validation and diversity in populations and delivery methods [^114rA4kS] [^114nNWEH] [^112qPdaU]. Hold on, I should verify that the recommendation is indeed conditional; yes, it is explicitly conditional and calls for more research [^112qPdaU].

> I should also review dyspnea and perioperative contexts briefly. For advanced cancer dyspnea, ASCO suggests acupressure or reflexology may be offered as weak recommendations with low-quality evidence, integrated with other nonpharmacologic measures; in perioperative care, acupressure may be considered as an adjunct for pain, PONV, and opioid sparing in some neurosurgical and anesthesia settings, though evidence quality varies and should be framed as optional within multimodal regimens [^112huaap] [^113mjnGC] [^114orky4] [^114p6gU5]. But wait, what if the patient is in an emergency setting; EUSEM suggests acupressure can be offered for pain and anxiety during ambulance transport after minor trauma, which is practical and low risk, though evidence quality is limited [^116pdaNe].

> Next, I should review mechanistic plausibility to ensure biological coherence. Acupressure likely engages peripheral sensory modulation, endogenous opioid and monoamine systems, and autonomic regulation, with PC6 effects plausibly mediated via somatosensory–vagal interactions influencing nausea circuits; however, acupoint specificity remains debated, and some effects may reflect generalized pressure or contextual factors, so I need to avoid over-attributing to precise point selection without stronger mechanistic data [^1133MtjD] [^115zsDCY] [^1162yfwn]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought acupressure might directly modulate vagal afferents at PC6, but I should confirm that the evidence is indirect and largely extrapolated from acupuncture literature; yes, the mechanistic chain is plausible but not definitively mapped for acupressure specifically, reinforcing the need for mechanistic trials [^1133MtjD].

> Safety comes next, and I need to ensure we don't understate risks. Across oncology and perioperative trials, acupressure adverse events are typically minor and transient, such as local discomfort, mild bruising, or skin irritation. Serious adverse events are rare, and FDA classification of PC6 devices as Class I reflects a favorable safety profile when used as directed, though patients with fragile skin, thrombocytopenia, or lymphedema require caution and individualized assessment [^115hsvQA] [^115SoFLs]. Hold on, I should verify that no major safety signals emerged in the large PONV network meta-analysis; indeed, reported harms were minor and self-limited, supporting safety in appropriately selected patients [^1129KfJU].

> I will now examine guideline positions to anchor clinical decisions. Major oncology guidelines endorse offering acupuncture or acupressure for pain during systemic therapy and for procedural or surgical pain, albeit with low-to-intermediate quality evidence and weak-to-moderate strength recommendations; primary care and pain guidelines variably suggest considering acupuncture for low back and neck pain, while evidence for acupressure remains insufficient in some contexts, reinforcing a shared decision-making approach rather than a blanket endorsement [^112TUGZz] [^111LgsK9] [^113sxJrr] [^1135M6B7] [^115up8Qd]. I should double-check that these recommendations emphasize feasibility and patient preference; yes, they consistently note noninvasiveness, low cost, and minimal harms as favorable features when evidence is modest [^114rA4kS].

> Implementation considerations matter for real-world uptake. Acupressure can be clinician- or self-administered, with growing use of training apps and simple tools to standardize pressure and technique. Barriers include variability in protocols, limited access to trained practitioners, and heterogeneity in trial designs, which complicates replication and scaling. Standardizing point selection, dosage, and training, and embedding acupressure within multimodal care pathways, can mitigate these issues while we await stronger efficacy data [^111xfUcK] [^112LFHQf] [^111iYRsN]. Wait, let me verify that self-administration is feasible in cancer populations; systematic reviews suggest it is acceptable and safe with proper instruction, though effectiveness signals are strongest for nausea and fatigue and weaker for pain, aligning with the broader evidence base [^111xfUcK] [^114rA4kS].

> Bringing this together, I should confirm a balanced, clinically actionable take. For adults with cancer pain, especially moderate-to-severe pain or those aiming to reduce opioids, offering acupressure — particularly auricular techniques — as an adjunct is reasonable given moderate-quality evidence and supportive guidelines, with explicit discussion of modest expected benefits and the need for concurrent standard care. For low back pain, evidence is mixed, so acupressure may be tried selectively when accessible, but it should not replace guideline-concordant physical therapy or exercise. For CINV, PC6 acupressure can be considered as an adjunct when antiemetics are insufficient, acknowledging guideline uncertainty. For post-treatment cancer-related fatigue, a trial of self-acupressure is reasonable given a single high-quality RCT. Across scenarios, screen for contraindications, set expectations, and reassess early for response [^113AhoGj] [^112TUGZz] [^112sEDc4] [^114rA4kS]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not overstating certainty; I've kept recommendations aligned with evidence quality and explicitly flagged where evidence is low or conditional, which matches the guideline tenor and meta-analytic caveats [^112TUGZz] [^113AhoGj].

> Finally, I need to ensure the research agenda is clear. Priority gaps include larger, multicenter RCTs with standardized protocols and sham controls for pain, head-to-head comparisons with active therapies, dose–frequency optimization for self-administration, and mechanistic studies linking point selection to physiologic outcomes. Addressing these will refine patient selection, improve reproducibility, and clarify where acupressure adds meaningful value beyond placebo and contextual effects [^1161JYbm] [^111iYRsN] [^115zsDCY]. I should double-check that current heterogeneity and small sample sizes are repeatedly cited as limitations; yes, they are consistently emphasized across meta-analyses and guidelines, reinforcing the call for more rigorous, pragmatic trials [^113AhoGj] [^112TUGZz].

Acupressure vector therapy is a **non-invasive technique** that applies pressure to specific acupoints to modulate pain, nausea, and anxiety, with **moderate evidence** for cancer pain [^1147errq], chemotherapy-induced nausea [^notfound], and postoperative recovery [^114orky4]. It is **safe, low-cost, and patient-administered**, making it a practical adjunct to standard care, though effects are modest and heterogeneous [^1161JYbm]; high-quality, standardized trials are needed to define optimal protocols and patient selection [^116gRURJ].

---

## Mechanisms of action

Acupressure is thought to work through **neurophysiological and biochemical pathways**:

- **Neurophysiological mechanisms**: Stimulation of acupoints activates afferent fibers, modulating spinal and supraspinal pain pathways and releasing endogenous opioids and serotonin [^116Ay8Vj].

- **Biochemical mechanisms**: Acupressure may alter neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine) and hormones (cortisol), reducing pain, anxiety, and nausea [^116Ay8Vj].

- **Psychological mechanisms**: Patient expectancy and therapeutic touch may contribute to observed benefits [^111nAppd].

---

## Clinical evidence

### Pain management

- **Cancer pain**: Acupuncture/acupressure is associated with modest reductions in cancer pain and opioid use, with moderate certainty evidence [^115V5TV2] [^1147errq].

- **Low back pain**: Acupressure shows short-term improvements in pain and disability versus physical therapy, but evidence quality is limited [^117Garn2] [^111bVoC5].

- **Postoperative pain**: Acupressure may reduce pain and opioid consumption after surgery, though results are inconsistent [^114orky4] [^112aczWo].

---

### Nausea and vomiting

Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) shows **modest reductions** with acupressure, particularly for acute nausea, and is recommended as an adjunct in some guidelines [^115EazEK] [^114hSMfx]. Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) also shows benefit, especially with PC6 stimulation, though **effect sizes are small** [^1129KfJU].

---

### Anxiety and fatigue

Anxiety may improve with acupressure in cancer and perioperative settings, likely via **autonomic modulation** and **expectancy effects** [^116Ay8Vj]. Fatigue shows **preliminary evidence** of reduced cancer-related fatigue with self-administered acupressure, but larger trials are needed [^114rA4kS].

---

## Safety and tolerability

Acupressure is **generally safe**, with minimal adverse effects (e.g. transient discomfort, bruising). It is **non-invasive**, requires no pharmaceuticals, and is suitable for self-administration, including in vulnerable populations [^115SoFLs].

---

## Comparison with acupuncture

| **Feature** | **Acupressure** | **Acupuncture** |
|-|-|-|
| Technique | Manual pressure | Needle insertion |
| Invasiveness | Non-invasive | Minimally invasive |
| Evidence | Moderate | Moderate to high |
| Safety | High | High (with trained practitioners) |
| Cost | Low | Moderate |

---

Acupressure offers a **non-invasive, low-cost alternative** with moderate evidence, whereas acupuncture has stronger evidence but requires trained practitioners and equipment.

---

## Limitations and gaps in research

- **Heterogeneity**: Variability in acupoints, techniques, and outcomes limits comparability [^111xfUcK].

- **Small samples**: Many studies are underpowered [^115pYiCR].

- **Blinding**: Difficulty blinding may inflate effects [^1161JYbm].

- **Standardization**: Lack of standardized protocols hampers replication [^111xfUcK].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines suggest acupressure as an **adjunct** for cancer pain, CINV, and postoperative symptoms, with conditional recommendations due to modest effects and heterogeneity [^112TUGZz] [^113sxJrr] [^112sEDc4].

---

## Practical considerations for implementation

- **Training**: Patients and clinicians need brief training for accurate point location and pressure application [^114rA4kS].

- **Devices**: Wristbands and pressure tools can standardize delivery [^115SoFLs].

- **Integration**: Best used alongside standard care, not as a replacement [^115ND9h6].

---

Acupressure vector therapy is a **safe, low-cost, non-invasive** modality with **moderate evidence** for pain, nausea, and anxiety, particularly in oncology and perioperative care. It is best used as an adjunct, with further high-quality, standardized trials needed to clarify protocols and patient selection [^114orky4].

Introduction

Pain is a distressing symptom experienced by more than 70% of patients with cancer but inadequately controlled in nearly 50% of these patients. Although the World Health Organization analgesic ladder provides effectual approaches to relieve cancer pain, addiction to analgesics and the adverse effects of pharmacological interventions pose critical challenges to pain management. Because pain is multidimensional, a multidisciplinary, comprehensive approach is needed to control pain successfully.

The ongoing opioid crisis in the United States exacerbates the challenges surrounding cancer pain management, with government organizations calling for the use of nonpharmacological interventionson the basis of increasing clinical evidence. Leading organizations in the field, such as the American Society for Clinical Oncology and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, recommend nonpharmacological interventions, such as acupuncture, for managing cancer pain.

Research on acupuncture for cancer pain has been growing, but the findings have been inconsistent. Although more than 20 systematic reviews were conducted to establish the association of acupuncture with cancer pain, none arrived at a definitive conclusion. In addition, more rigorous randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of acupuncture and related therapies published in recent years were not included in previous systematic reviews. For example, a multicenter RCT of acupuncture published in 2018 found that patients with early-stage breast cancer who received aromatase inhibitor therapy experienced significant pain relief. The reduction in pain reported in this 2018 study was clinically relevant.

In light of the growing number of RCTs of acupuncture or acupressure use for cancer pain and the ensuing need for critical evaluation, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available evidence to inform clinical practice. The specific research questions were as follows: (1) Are acupuncture and acupressure associated with reduction in cancer pain compared with sham control or usual care control? (2) Is the combination of acupuncture and acupressure associated with reduction in analgesic use in patients with cancer?

Diagnosis & treatment of low back pain — exercise/physical therapy versus or plus massage: There is insufficient evidence to determine the efficacy of acupressure compared to a standardized multimodal physical therapy (Grade of Recommendation: I). In the long term, it is suggested that the addition of massage to an exercise program provides no benefit when compared to an exercise program alone (Grade of Recommendation: B). There is insufficient evidence that the addition of massage to an exercise program provides short-term relief of pain (Grade of Recommendation: I).

### A comparison between acute pressure block of the sciatic nerve and acupressure: methodology, analgesia, and mechanism involved [^115su5HP]. Journal of Pain Research (2013). Low credibility.

Acupressure is an alternative medicine methodology that originated in ancient China. Treatment effects are achieved by stimulating acupuncture points using acute pressure. Acute pressure block of the sciatic nerve is a newly reported analgesic method based on a current neuroscience concept: stimulation of the peripheral nerves increases the pain threshold. Both methods use pressure as an intervention method. Herein, we compare the methodology and mechanism of these two methods, which exhibit several similarities and differences. Acupressure entails variation in the duration of manipulation, and the analgesic effect achieved can be short-or long-term. The acute effect attained with acupressure presents a scope that is very different from that of the chronic effect attained after long-term treatment. This acute effect appears to have some similarities to that achieved with acute pressure block of the sciatic nerve, both in methodology and mechanism. More evidence is needed to determine whether there is a relationship between the two methods.

### Prehospital analgesia with acupressure in victims of minor trauma: a prospective, randomized, double-blinded trial [^113eEDjx]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2002). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Untreated pain during the transportation of patients after minor trauma is a common problem in emergency medicine. Because paramedics usually are not allowed to perform invasive procedures or to give drugs for pain treatment, a noninvasive, nondrug-based method would be helpful. Acupressure is a traditional Chinese treatment for pain that is based on pain relief followed by a short mechanical stimulation of specific points. Consequently, we tested the hypothesis that effective pain therapy is possible by paramedics who are trained in acupressure. In a double-blinded trial we included 60 trauma patients. We randomly assigned them into three groups ("true points", "sham-points", and "no acupressure"). An independent observer, blinded to the treatment assignment, recorded vital variables and visual analog scales for pain and anxiety before and after treatment. At the end of transport, we asked for ratings of overall satisfaction. For statistical evaluation, one-way analysis of variance and the Scheffé F test were used. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Morphometric and demographic data and potential confounding factors such as age, sex, pain, anxiety, blood pressure, and heart rate before treatment did not differ among the groups. At the end of transport we found significantly less pain, anxiety, and heart rate and a greater satisfaction in the "true points" groups (P < 0.01). Our results show that acupressure is an effective and simple-to-learn treatment of pain in emergency trauma care and leads to an improvement of the quality of care in emergency transport. We suggest that this technique is easy to learn and risk free and may improve paramedic-based rescue systems.

Implications

We tested, in a double-blinded manner, the hypothesis that acupressure could be an effective pain therapy in minor-trauma patients. Our results show that acupressure is an effective and simple-to-learn treatment of pain in emergency medical care and can improve the quality of care.

### Manual therapy in primary dysmenorrhea: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114a5NNA]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Effective Rate

3 studies, reported that the short-term effective rate in the manual therapy group was significantly higher than that in the no treatment control group (n = 106, OR = 8.73, 95% CI: 3.03~25.19), with no observed heterogeneity (I 2 = 0), as illustrated in Figure 6. A subgroup analysis showed that, in terms of improving effective rate, massage was superior to no treatment (n = 74, OR = 11.15, 95% CI: 3.40~36.58), but holographic therapy was not as beneficial (n = 32, OR = 3.46, 95% CI: 0.32~37.47).

Overall and various manual therapies subgroup forest plot of weighted OR (95% CI) for effective rate for manual therapy versus no treatment.

MDQ

Additionally, 4 studies, reported MDQ scores. The results indicated that acupressure can lead to a greater reduction in MDQ scores compared to no treatment (n = 309, MD = 3.84, 95% CI: 2.27~5.40), as depicted in Figure 7. The subgroup analysis demonstrated that the benefit might extend from short-term, intermediate to long- term.

Manual Therapy versus Placebo

Pain Intensity

3 studies, comparing manual therapy to a placebo reported outcomes related to pain, suggested that the differences in the effects of manual therapy and the placebo on pain may not be statistically significant in short term (n = 255, MD = 0.01, 95% CI: −0.37~0.58), as depicted in Figure 8. The interventions in these three studies were acupressure, spinal manipulative therapy, and foot reflexology. The meta-analysis results are consistent with the findings of the original studies but lack clinical significance.

Manual Therapy versus NSAIDs

### Manual therapy in primary dysmenorrhea: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115UMUns]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Effective Rate

11 studies, reported that the manual therapy group exhibited a significantly higher effective rate to the NSAIDs (n = 1029, OR = 4.87, 95% CI: 3.29~7.20), showing no heterogeneity (I 2 = 19%). When compared to NSAIDs, the subgroup analysis revealed that acupressure, massage, and a holographic treatment are more beneficial in increasing effective rate. These findings were summarized in Figure 11. Subgroup analysis based on different follow-up durations indicates that manual therapy has an advantage over NSAIDs in improving effective rate, particularly in the short-term (n = 949, OR = 4.77, 95% CI: 3.17~7.17) and intermediate (n = 80, OR = 6.13, 95% CI: 1.57~23.98), as depicted in Figure 12.

MPQ

The reported results from the single studyindicated a greater reduction in pain for acupressure compared to NSAIDs in short-term (n = 80, MD = −6.92, 95% CI: −10.90~-2.94), which was proven by MPQ scores.

Adverse Events

Among the 32 studies analyzed, adverse events associated with the interventions were documented in only 2 studies. 1 studyhighlighted soreness in the lower back region associated with spinal manipulative therapy. In contrast, another studyreported adverse events linked to self-acupressure, including bruises, deterioration, hand pain, pressure pain, menstrual cycle shifts, dizziness, nausea, leg pain, and finger tingling. The majority of these adverse events were considered minor, as they either resolved spontaneously or were treated effectively.

Quality of Evidence

To assess quality, GRADEpro GDT was employed, incorporating outcomes from the enrolled studies. The evidence was generally appraised as being of low or very low quality based on GRADE criteria, attributable to the elevated risk of bias and pronounced heterogeneity. Notably, self-rating scales employed as a primary outcome for pain assessment were considered low-quality evidence. The summarized findings of interventions are presented in Table 3.

### Clinical evidence for association of acupuncture and acupressure with improved cancer pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1161JYbm]. JAMA Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. Substantial heterogeneity was observed and contributed to lowering the evidence grade from high to moderate. Sensitivity analyses were attempted through subgroup analyses, which showed reduced heterogeneity (Figures 2 and 3) for manual acupuncture and moderate to severe pain. Because cancer pain is highly complex, the type of pain, cancer treatment (eg, surgical procedure, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy as well as phase of care such as active treatment, survivorship, and palliative care), and acupuncture method are likely factors in the variability of estimates. More research in specific areas is needed to fully assess how these factors play a role in heterogeneity. Among the open-label studies, high risk of bias existed owing to lack of blinding. In most of these studies, baseline analgesic use was not specified, and in 2 studies, participants did not use analgesic therapy at baseline. Consequently, variations in analgesic type and dose among participants within each study and between studies also likely contributed to heterogeneity. Because of the limited number of trials included for each comparison in the meta-analysis, funnel plots were not feasible. Therefore, we could not fully evaluate publication bias.

### Stimulation of the wrist acupuncture point PC6 for preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting: a network meta-analysis [^1129KfJU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are common complications following surgery and anaesthesia. Antiemetic drugs are only partially effective in preventing PONV. Stimulating the PC6 acupoint(s) on the wrist offers an alternative approach, but the effectiveness of the various common techniques is unclear.

Objectives

To update and compare the effects and safety of PC6 acupoint stimulation with or without antiemetic drug(s) versus sham or antiemetic drug(s) for preventing postoperative nausea (PON) and postoperative vomiting (POV) in people undergoing surgery, and to identify the most effective techniques using network meta-analyses (NMAs).

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ISI Web of Science, CINAHL, WHO Global Index Medicus, major trial registries, and reference lists of articles for studies up to 6 June 2025, with no language restrictions.

Eligibility Criteria

Parallel randomised controlled trials of techniques that compared any combinations of PC6 acupoint stimulation, drug therapy, and sham for preventing PONV in children and adults were eligible. Interventions included invasive techniques (e.g. needle acupuncture) and noninvasive techniques (e.g. acupressure wristbands). Drug therapy included antiemetics that belonged to one of the following substance classes: 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists, D 2 receptor antagonists, corticosteroids, and antihistamines. The sham group included sham PC6 interventions and/or placebo saline antiemetic interventions.

Outcomes

Critical outcomes: incidence of PON and POV. Important outcomes: need for rescue antiemetic therapy when prophylaxis failed and adverse events (side effects).

Risk Of Bias

We assessed the risk of bias in the included studies using RoB 1.

Synthesis Methods

We performed frequentist NMAs using random-effects models to report risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). We compared the relative effects (with sham as reference) of six broad classes of PC6 acupoint stimulation techniques and their combined use with antiemetic drugs on the outcomes. We summarised the safety data narratively due to heterogeneous reporting of adverse events (side effects). We assessed the certainty of evidence of the NMA treatment effect on outcomes according to the CINeMA and GRADE approaches.

Included Studies

This update included 77 trials, conducted between 1986 and 2022, involving 9847 participants. The majority were adults across several countries (USA, South Korea, India, China, Turkey, and Iran). There were 58 (33.9%) sham groups, 16 (9.4%) invasive PC6 acupoint stimulation groups, 50 (29.3%) noninvasive PC6 acupoint stimulation groups, 32 (18.7%) antiemetic(s) groups, 4 (2.3%) combined invasive PC6 acupoint stimulation and antiemetic(s) groups, 10 (5.8%) combined noninvasive PC6 acupoint stimulation and antiemetic(s) groups, and one (0.6%) combined invasive and noninvasive PC6 acupoint stimulation group for the NMAs. The high risk of bias was primarily due to selective reporting.

Synthesis Of Results

Postoperative nausea The evidence from the NMA (63 studies; 7534 participants) suggests that the combined invasive PC6 and antiemetics technique probably results in a larger reduction in PON than sham (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.45; moderate confidence from indirect evidence only). The evidence also suggests that invasive PC6, noninvasive PC6, and antiemetic(s) may reduce PON, compared to sham (invasive PC6: RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.64, low confidence; noninvasive PC6: RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.76, low confidence; antiemetic(s): RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.91, very low confidence). The combined use of noninvasive PC6 and antiemetic(s) may reduce PON, compared to sham, based on indirect evidence (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.96; low confidence). Postoperative vomiting The evidence from the NMA (75 studies; 8627 participants) suggests that the combined invasive PC6 and antiemetics technique may result in a moderate reduction in POV, compared to sham (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.76; low confidence from indirect evidence only). The evidence also suggests that invasive PC6, noninvasive PC6, antiemetic(s), and combined noninvasive PC6 and antiemetic(s) may reduce POV, compared to sham (invasive PC6: RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.64, low confidence; noninvasive PC6: RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.70, low confidence; antiemetic(s): RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.81, very low confidence; combined noninvasive PC6 and antiemetic(s): RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.83, very low confidence). The combined use of noninvasive PC6 and invasive PC6 may result in little to no difference in POV, compared to sham, based on direct evidence (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.44; low confidence). Need for rescue antiemetic drug(s) The evidence from the NMA (55 studies; 6614 participants) suggests that combined use of noninvasive PC6 and antiemetic(s) probably reduces the need for rescue antiemetic drug(s) when prophylactic techniques fail, compared to sham (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.70; moderate confidence from indirect evidence). Antiemetic(s), noninvasive PC6, and invasive PC6 may reduce the need for rescue antiemetics, compared to sham (antiemetic(s): RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.80, very low confidence; noninvasive PC6: RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.70, low confidence; invasive PC6: RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.84, low confidence). The combined use of invasive PC6 and antiemetic(s) (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.04 to 2.49; low confidence from indirect evidence only) and the combined use of noninvasive PC6 and invasive PC6 may result in little or no difference in the need for rescue antiemetic drug(s), compared to sham (RR 1.41, 95% CI 0.64 to 3.09; low confidence from direct evidence only). Adverse events (side effects) None of the included studies reported serious or long-term complications. Thirty-nine studies, involving 5334 participants, reported minor side effects that go away (e.g. skin irritation, redness, and swelling) with PC6 acupoint stimulation, but the evidence is very uncertain. Publication bias was not apparent in the NMA funnel plots.

Authors' Conclusions

NMAs suggest that both invasive and noninvasive PC6 acupoint stimulation combined with antiemetics may reduce PON and POV, compared to sham, and likely lower rescue antiemetic use. PC6 acupoint stimulation may cause minor side effects, but the evidence is very uncertain.

### Clinical evidence for association of acupuncture and acupressure with improved cancer pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117FU4JB]. JAMA Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Methods

This systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO registration No. CRD42017064113), with its peer-reviewed protocol published online, focused on RCTs involving acupuncture and acupressure interventions for addressing pain intensity and analgesic dose in patients with cancer. The quality of RCTs was appraised with the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool. The overall evidence and certainty of evidence were evaluated with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach.

Search Strategy and Study Selection

Three English-language databases (PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL) and 4 Chinese-language databases (Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang) were searched for RCTs published from the database inception through March 31, 2019. The search strategy consisted of 3 components: clinical condition (cancer, tumor/tumour, carcinoma, neoplasm AND pain, analgesia), intervention (manual acupuncture, electroacupuncture, body or auricular acupressure), and study type (randomized clinical trial). Existing systematic reviews were examined to identify additional trials. Two of us (Y.H. and Y.L.) independently screened the records of comprehensive searches by titles and abstracts, or full text as needed, to establish the eligibility of the studies. Articles published in the English or Chinese language were included if they were RCTs (with or without blinding, including crossover design and pragmatic trials) investigating the association of acupuncture and acupressure with cancer pain. Pain directly accompanying the development of cancer and/or chronic pain associated with cancer treatments was included. Studies of acupuncture for short-term analgesia associated with surgical procedures were excluded. Eligible interventions were acupuncture and acupressure regardless of needling techniques and stimulation methods, including manual acupuncture and acupressure, electroacupuncture, or a combination of these techniques. The comparison could be between sham or placebo acupuncture and analgesic therapy or usual care without additional intervention. Studies comparing 2 kinds of acupuncture techniques or acupuncture with another traditional Chinese medicine therapy (eg, herbal medicine, massage) were excluded. Pain intensity was selected as the targeted outcome because of its substantial role in cancer pain assessment and pain management. Outcome measures included the Brief Pain Inventory, Numerical Rating Scale, Visual Analog Scale, Verbal Rating Scale, and other validated instruments for assessing the intensity of pain. Studies that reported only improvement rates were excluded.

### Network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing the effectiveness of different treatments in reducing amniocentesis-associated pain and anxiety [^116Ay8Vj]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

H7 Acupressure proved to be successful in lowering anxiety after AC. The results can be explained by a number of various mechanisms. Cortisol and stress are associated in that as stress rises, cortisol also rises. In the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, the stimulation of acupressure points alters hormonal-neuronal responses, which in turn controls cortisol output and induces calm. Additionally, by activating the anterior pituitary, acupressure can boost serotonin and dopamine release. Serotonin and dopamine levels in the plasma rise, which reduces cortisol synthesis. In addition, the stimulation of the acupressure point releases endorphins, which peak 30 min after the stimulation begins and remain elevated for 10 h. Similarly, serotonin levels are raised, and endorphins are released when the H7 acupoint is stimulated vigorously and repeatedly. However, other factors must be taken into account while using this method as they may have an impact on the outcomes, such as the target population, the acupressure points employed, and the length of the acupressure.

Limitations

The majority of the included studies had a high overall risk of bias, which could have an impact on the study's findings. We exclude some trials to conduct a single network meta-analysis.

Acupressure for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in patients with breast cancer who are receiving chemotherapy can be considered as an addition to antiemetics to help control nausea and vomiting (grade B), based on 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported between 2000 and 2007. Participants were undergoing the first, second, or third cycle of chemotherapy, with sample sizes ranging from 17 to 160 participants; interventions included self-acupressure using a finger and acupressure wristbands. Across the 3 trials, acupressure therapy produced significant decreases in nausea, retching, and vomiting (P < .05 for multiple outcomes assessing CINV), and a review across all cancers concluded that acupressure should be strongly recommended as an effective intervention along with standard care for CINV control.

Safety of Acupuncture and Acupressure and Overall Evidence

The adverse events reported were minor, did not require medical evaluation or any specific intervention, and consisted predominantly of skin and subcutaneous tissue disorder or slight pain from the application of treatment to the skin. Six RCTs reported no adverse events during the study period. In all of the trials included, no dropouts were attributed to adverse effects associated with acupuncture treatment. Evidence from RCTs indicated with a moderate level of certainty that real acupuncture was associated with reduced pain intensity as compared with sham acupuncture or wait-list controls. Moderate-quality evidence also suggested that acupuncture and acupressure were associated with reduced analgesic use.

### Acupuncture for smoking cessation [^112M8Gp4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Acupuncture and related techniques are promoted as a treatment for smoking cessation in the belief that they may reduce nicotine withdrawal symptoms.

Objectives

The objective of this review is to determine the effectiveness of acupuncture and the allied therapies of acupressure, laser therapy and electrostimulation, in smoking cessation in comparison with: a) sham treatment, b) other interventions, or c) no intervention.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Medline, Embase, BIOSIS Previews, PsycINFO, Science and Social Sciences Citation Index, AMED and CISCOM. Date of last search January 2002.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing a form of acupuncture, acupressure, laser therapy or electrostimulation with either sham treatment, another intervention or no intervention for smoking cessation.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data in duplicate on the type of smokers recruited, the nature of the acupuncture and control procedures, the outcome measures, method of randomisation, and completeness of follow-up. We assessed abstinence from smoking at the earliest time-point (before 6 weeks), at six months and at one year or more follow-up in patients smoking at baseline. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. Those lost to follow-up were counted as continuing to smoke. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a fixed effects model.

Main Results

We identified 22 studies. Acupuncture was not superior to sham acupuncture in smoking cessation at any time point. The odds ratio (OR) for early outcomes was 1.22 (95% confidence interval 0.99 to 1.49); the OR after 6 months was 1.50 (95% confidence interval 0.99 to 2.27) and after 12 months 1.08 (95% confidence interval 0.77 to 1.52). Similarly, when acupuncture was compared with other anti-smoking interventions, there were no differences in outcome at any time point. Acupuncture appeared to be superior to no intervention in the early results, but this difference was not sustained. The results with different acupuncture techniques do not show any one particular method (i.e. auricular acupuncture or non-auricular acupuncture) to be superior to control intervention. Based on the results of single studies, acupressure was found to be superior to advice; laser therapy and electrostimulation were not superior to sham forms of these therapies.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is no clear evidence that acupuncture, acupressure, laser therapy or electrostimulation are effective for smoking cessation.

### Self-acupressure for symptom management in cancer patients: a systematic review [^111xfUcK]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2023). Medium credibility.

Context

Acupressure is a popular nonpharmacological intervention that is increasingly proven to effectively alleviate symptoms in patients with cancer. However, the effects of self-acupressure on cancer symptom management are less clear.

Objectives

This systematic review is the first to summarize the current experimental evidence on self-acupressure for symptom management in cancer patients.

Methods

Eight electronic databases were searched for experimental studies that examined self-acupressure for cancer patients with symptoms and published in peer-reviewed English or Chinese journals. The methodological quality of the included studies was evaluated using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias assessment tool and the JBI critical appraisal checklist for quasi-experimental studies. Data were extracted as predefined and synthesized narratively. The Template for Intervention Description and Replication checklist was used to report the intervention characteristics.

Results

A total of 11 studies were included in this study, six as feasibility or pilot trials. The methodological quality of included studies was suboptimal. Substantial heterogeneity was observed in acupressure training, acupoint selection, intervention duration, dosage, and timing. Self-acupressure was only associated with reduced nausea and vomiting (P = 0.006 and P = 0.001).

Conclusion

The limited evidence from this review precludes the definitive conclusions on intervention effectiveness for cancer symptoms. Future research should consider developing the standard protocol for intervention delivery, improving the methodology of self-acupressure trials, and conducting large-scale research to advance the science of self-acupressure for cancer symptom management.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^113vDaTL]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Physical medicine & rehabilitation — exercise or physical therapy versus or plus massage evidence summary describes randomized trials in chronic low back pain (LBP): Patients received treatment for 4 weeks in both groups; pain scores were evaluated in 56 and 65 patients at 6 months with 82% follow-up, and at 6-month follow-up there was significant reduction in pain in the acupressure group compared to physical therapy, providing Level I evidence that acupressure results in significantly greater relief of pain than usual care hospital based physical therapy at medium-term follow-up. A second randomized study reported that at 6 months, with 84% follow-up, there was significant improvement in pain and disability scores in the acupressure group compared to physical therapy and provides Level I evidence that acupressure results in significantly greater improvement in pain and function than standardized outpatient physical therapy at medium-term follow-up. These two studies by Hsieh et al provided high quality evidence favoring acupressure over physical therapy; however, the acupressure was administered by one provider in both studies and concerns for external validity demand corroborating results by other providers to verify efficacy. Kankaanpaa et al conducted a randomized trial comparing active rehabilitation to heat and massage; there were 54 patients total with 91% follow-up at one year, the active group showed more improvement in pain and disability scores, and it provides Level II evidence that active rehabilitation results in greater improvement in LBP relative to heat and massage at one year.

### A comparison between acute pressure block of the sciatic nerve and acupressure: methodology, analgesia, and mechanism involved [^115VsZfq]. Journal of Pain Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Acupressure is an alternative medicine methodology that originated in ancient China and is a popular therapy worldwide. Acupressure involves application of acute pressure on the acupuncture points to achieve treatment effects that are similar to those of the acupuncture method.–According to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), stimulating these points can correct imbalance in the flow of qi through channels known as meridians, rebalancing yin and yang and subsequently treating diseases. Instead of using a thin needle to stimulate the specific points, acupressure uses the fingers, elbow, fist, etc to stimulate the acupuncture points. Acupressure displays therapeutic effects for several types of diseases. There are several types of pressure points; pressure to each is applied differently, and each creates a different effect accordingly.

Acute pressure block of the sciatic nerve is a newly reported analgesic method,–based on a current neuroscience concept: stimulation of the peripheral nerves increases the pain threshold. The method works well to alleviate various types of clinical pain but not experimental cold pressor pain or intense pain. Some physicians, patients, and scientists have interpreted this method as another approach for delivering the previously described analgesic method, acupressure. Herein, we compare the methodology and mechanism of these two methods. An understanding of these aspects is important for their application in clinical practice and improvement of their efficacy.

The theoretical target objects of the two methods are different. Acupressure uses pressure to stimulate specific acupuncture points for therapeutic purposes. In contrast, acute pressure block of the sciatic nerve method uses pressure to stimulate the sciatic nerve.–The stimulation site is an area rather than a point, and stimulation of a larger area provides better pain relief. Many acupuncture points are located over nerves (Figure 1). Thus, pressure over a larger area may cause stimulation of several points. Future studies are required to examine the rationale behind them.

These methods entail different degrees of pressure application. The optimal method for applying acupressure focuses on a point, using, for example, the thumbs, fingers, elbows, or suitable devices; however, the optimal method for acute pressure block of the sciatic nerve is to apply pressure to a larger area, using, for example, the palms of the hands, the flat surfaces of the fists, or suitable devices.

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries in adults: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians and American Academy of Family Physicians [^111oiSEQ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Pain relief at 1 to 7 days — adults with acute non–low back musculoskeletal injuries: Moderate-certainty evidence showed that on a 10‑cm visual analog scale (VAS), specific acupressure reduced pain (WMD, −2.09 cm [CI, −2.85 to −1.33 cm]) and supervised rehabilitation increased pain at 1 to 7 days (WMD, 1.06 [CI, 0.74 to 1.38 cm]) versus placebo; low‑certainty evidence showed that TENS reduced pain (WMD, −1.18 cm [−2.09 to −0.28 cm]). High‑certainty evidence showed acetaminophen plus opioids reduced pain (WMD, −1.71 cm [CI, −2.97 to −0.46 cm]); moderate‑certainty evidence showed acetaminophen alone (WMD, −1.07 cm [CI, −1.89 to −0.24 cm]), oral nonsteroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (WMD, −0.99 cm [CI, −1.46 to −0.52 cm]), and topical NSAIDs (WMD, −1.08 cm [CI, −1.40 to −0.75 cm]) reduced pain versus placebo; low‑certainty evidence showed acetaminophen plus chlorzoxazone also reduced pain (WMD, −2.92 cm [CI, −5.41 to −0.43 cm]). Interventions that did not show statistically significant pain reduction included ultrasound therapy (moderate‑certainty evidence) and nonspecific acupressure, exercise, and laser therapy (low‑certainty evidence). Evidence was gathered from 69 randomized controlled trials (10 829 patients).

### Management of dyspnea in advanced cancer: ASCO guideline [^113mjnGC]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

ASCO guideline — nonpharmacologic palliation of dyspnea in advanced cancer states the following: Airflow interventions such as directing a fan at the cheek (trigeminal nerve distribution) should be offered (type: evidence-based; evidence quality: intermediate; strength of recommendation: moderate). Standard supplemental oxygen should be available for patients with hypoxemia who are experiencing dyspnea (ie, SpO2 ≤ 90% on room air) (type: evidence-based; evidence quality: intermediate; strength of recommendation: moderate). Supplemental oxygen is not recommended when SpO2 > 90% (type: evidence-based; evidence quality: intermediate; strength of recommendation: moderate). A time-limited therapeutic trial of high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy, if available, may be offered to patients who have significant dyspnea and hypoxemia despite standard supplemental oxygen (type: evidence-based; evidence quality: low; strength of recommendation: moderate). A time-limited therapeutic trial of noninvasive ventilation, if available, may be offered to patients who have significant dyspnea despite standard measures and do not have contraindications (type: evidence-based; evidence quality: low; strength of recommendation: moderate). Other nonpharmacologic measures such as breathing techniques, posture, relaxation, distraction, meditation, self-management, physical therapy, and music therapy may be offered (type: evidence-based; evidence quality: low; strength of recommendation: weak). Acupressure or reflexology, if available, may be offered (type: evidence-based; evidence quality: low; strength of recommendation: weak). Evidence remains insufficient for a recommendation for or against pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with advanced cancer and dyspnea.

### A comparison between acute pressure block of the sciatic nerve and acupressure: methodology, analgesia, and mechanism involved [^1139R7oK]. Journal of Pain Research (2013). Low credibility.

The amount of pressure required is usually approximately 10 kg to 20 kg per hand area for a man of average size.–Therefore, although the thumbs, fingers, or elbows are ideal for stimulating the acupuncture points in the acupressure method, they are not ideal for acute pressure block of the sciatic nerve, because the area required for this method is much larger. These reasons may indicate that the mechanisms involved in the two methods are different.

Theoretically, each acupuncture point usually is effective for one or a few types of diseases, whereas acute pressure block of the sciatic nerve has been shown to work for more general areas of the body. In TCM, a disease is generally perceived as disharmony (or an imbalance) in the functions or interactions of the meridians, such as yin, yang, xue, and zang-fu. Therefore, the appropriate therapy is recommended on the basis of which "pattern of disharmony" can be identified. There are 360 acupuncture points, each with its own therapeutic significance. The selection of which point to target is a key step in acupressure practice, and selection of the correct acupuncture point is essential to achieve good treatment outcomes. Various principles are proposed for selecting these points. For example, a common method for choosing acupuncture points is to select nearby points, which means points are selected in a local area that is adjacent to the disease-affected area.

### Clinical evidence for association of acupuncture and acupressure with improved cancer pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115G9VCg]. JAMA Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Synthesis of Evidence

Meta-analysis of RCTs with available data was performed by calculating the effect size and 95% CI using the random-effects model. Heterogeneity among trials was identified by the χ 2 test and reported as I 2. Statistical analyses were performed with Stata, version 14.0 (StataCorp LLC). Two-sided P < .05 was considered statistically significant.

Studies were grouped according to the type of intervention (acupuncture, acupressure, or combination) and the comparator (sham therapy). For studies with more than 1 control group, such as real acupuncture vs sham acupuncture vs wait- list control, the results were split into pairwise comparisons by the different comparators. When different outcomes from the same study were reported in separate publications, the data were merged.

Given the strong correlation between scales of pain assessment, the results measured by the Visual Analog Scale were converted to the corresponding grade in the 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (0 points indicating no pain and 10 points indicating most severe pain). For example, a result of 40 mm on the 100-mm version of the Visual Analog Scale was recorded as 4 points for data synthesis. The results of the Numerical Rating Scale, the converted Visual Analog Scale, and the Brief Pain Inventory severity subscale were used in the meta-analysis.

Subgroup sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore potential sources of heterogeneity. When possible and appropriate, planned subgroup analyses included the source of pain (cancerous organ or specific treatment), severity of pain (mild, moderate, or severe), and type of treatment (manual acupuncture, electroacupuncture, or auricular acupuncture).

Publication bias was assessed by funnel plots and the Egger test for asymmetry when at least 10 trials were included. The quality and certainty of evidence are summarized in the eTable.

### Auricular point acupressure for older adults with chronic low back pain: a randomized controlled trial [^116MNeHH]. Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic low back pain (cLBP) is a major public health concern affecting over 45% of older adults. It is the leading cause of disability and creates an enormous public health burden. Pharmacotherapy is the predominant treatment for cLBP, but medications cause various side effects and contribute to the ongoing opioid crisis. Both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies are recommended by the American College of Physicians' (ACP) clinical practice guideline, yet none produce consistently large effects. In addition, implementation of these guidelines is challenging particularly for nonpharmacologic treatments. In a recent interview of primary care physicians, the most common nonpharmacologic treatments used are physical therapy (78%), chiropractic care (21%), massage therapy (18%), and acupuncture (17%). A larger study sample surveying patients with low back pain reported that provider recommendations for nonpharmacologic treatments included self-care (79%), physical therapy (60%), and massage, acupuncture, or spinal manipulation combined (37%). Since 2020, acupuncture has been covered by Medicare for the management of cLBP. However, scale-up is challenging due to the lack of access to acupuncturists as well as time and cost constraints.

### Efficacy of acupressure on quality of recovery after surgery: randomised controlled trial [^114izP1J]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Acupressure therapy is associated with favourable efficacies on postoperative nausea, pain and sleep disturbance, although the quality of the evidence is generally low. No randomised clinical trial has yet assessed the effect of acupressure on postoperative quality of recovery (QoR).

Objective

The objective was to study acupressure efficacy on patient-reported postoperative recovery.

Design

We conducted a single centre, three-group, blind, randomised controlled, pragmatic trial assessing acupressure therapy on the PC6, LI4 and HT7 acupoints.

Patients

Postoperative patients expected to stay in hospital at least 2 days after surgery.

Interventions

In the acupressure group, pressure was applied for 6min (2min per acupoint), three times a day after surgery for a maximum of 2 postoperative days during the hospital stay. In the sham group, extremely light touch was applied to the acupoints. The third group did not receive any touch.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was the change in the QoR, using the QoR-15 questionnaire, between postoperative days 1 and 3. Key secondary outcomes included patients' satisfaction, postoperative nausea and vomiting, pain score and opioid (morphine equivalent) consumption. Assessors for the primary and secondary endpoints were blind to the group allocation.

Results

Overall, 163 patients were randomised (acupressure n = 55, sham n = 53, no intervention n = 55). The mean (SD) postoperative change in QoR-15 did not differ statistically (P = 0.27) between the acupressure, sham and no intervention groups: 15.2 (17.8), 14.2 (21.9), 9.2 (21.7), respectively. Patient satisfaction (on a 0 to 10 scale) was statistically different (P = 0.01) among these three groups: 9.1 (1.5), 8.4 (1.6) and 8.2 (2.2), respectively. Changes in pain score and morphine equivalent consumption were not significantly different between the groups.

Conclusion

Two days of postoperative acupressure therapy (up to six treatments) did not significantly improve patient QoR, postoperative nausea and vomiting, pain score or opioid consumption. Acupressure, however, was associated with improved patient satisfaction.

Trial Registration

ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT02762435.

### Increasing the usefulness of acupuncture guideline recommendations [^111iYRsN]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

How useful are current acupuncture guidelines?

To be useful, clinical recommendations should explicitly describe the target patients with sufficient detail to allow clinicians to judge the extent of similarity to their patients. In acupuncture guidelines, as in some others, this is not always the case. Among acupuncture recommendations published in the past 10 years, less than 4% reported the severity of the underlying condition to which their recommendations apply, and less than 30% reported disease stage. For example, in 2019, the China Association of Chinese Medicine published a guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of knee osteoarthritis using traditional Chinese medicine. It recommended using acupuncture for knee pain, swelling, and limited function without specifying the severity of the osteoarthritis. It is unclear to which patient population (mild, moderate, severe, or all) its recommendations apply.

Failure to provide sufficient details regarding the interventions also limits clinicians' ability to implement the recommended acupuncture treatment. Just 40% of guidelines from conventional medicine organisations specified the types of acupuncture (eg, manual, electro-acupuncture, acupressure) they were recommending, and only 5% specified the range of points selected. The American College of Chest Physicians guideline on complementary therapies and integrative medicine for lung cancer suggested using acupuncture or related techniques as an adjunct treatment for nausea and vomiting from chemotherapy or radiation therapy (moderate certainty evidence, conditional recommendation). However, the recommendation did not specify the types of acupuncture, the range of acupoints selected, or the frequency and duration of treatment.

When using recommendations, clinicians need to understand how a particular intervention compares with available alternatives. The net benefit of a specific intervention is likely to differ substantially depending on the comparator. Current acupuncture recommendations often fail to make the comparator explicit (box 1). Without a clear comparison, a recommendation is not actionable.

### Use of massage therapy for pain, 2018–2023: a systematic review [^116XX5SH]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

There is a large literature of original randomized clinical trials and systematic reviews of randomized clinical trials of massage therapy as a treatment for pain. Our systematic review found that despite this literature, there were only a few conditions for which authors of systematic reviews concluded that there was at least moderate-certainty evidence regarding health outcomes associated with massage therapy and pain. Most reviews reported low- or very low–certainty evidence. Although adverse events associated with massage therapy for pain were rare, the evidence was limited. For reviews that had conclusions about adverse events, authors were uncertain if there was a difference between groups or did not find a difference between groups and rated the evidence low to very low certainty of evidence.

Massage therapy is a broad term that is inclusive of many styles and techniques. We applied exclusion criteria determined a priori to help identify publications for inclusion in the evidence map. Despite that procedure, there was still a lack of clarity in determining what massage therapy is. For instance, acupressure was sometimes considered acupuncture and other times considered massage therapy, depending on author definition. In this case, we reviewed and included only publications that were explicitly labeled acupressure and did not review publications about acupuncture only. This highlights a fundamental issue with examining the evidence base of massage therapy for pain when there is ambiguity in defining what is considered massage therapy.

### Acupuncture or acupressure for pain management during labour [^1121VwKp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Many women would like to avoid pharmacological or invasive methods of pain management in labour and this may contribute towards the popularity of complementary methods of pain management. This review examined evidence about the use of acupuncture and acupressure for pain management in labour. This is an update of a review last published in 2011.

Objectives

To examine the effects of acupuncture and acupressure for pain management in labour.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, (25 February 2019), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (the Cochrane Library 2019, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to February 2019), CINAHL (1980 to February 2019), ClinicalTrials.gov (February 2019), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platfory (ICTRP) (February 2019) and reference lists of included studies.

Selection Criteria

Published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing acupuncture or acupressure with placebo, no treatment or other non-pharmacological forms of pain management in labour. We included all women whether nulliparous or multiparous, and in spontaneous or induced labour. We included studies reported in abstract form if there was sufficient information to permit assessment of risk of bias. Trials using a cluster-RCT design were eligible for inclusion, but quasi-RCTs or cross-over studies were not.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 28 trials with data reporting on 3960 women. Thirteen trials reported on acupuncture and 15 trials reported on acupressure. No study was at a low risk of bias on all domains. Pain intensity was generally measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS) of 0 to 10 or 0 to 100 with low scores indicating less pain. Acupuncture versus sham acupuncture Acupuncture may make little or no difference to the intensity of pain felt by women when compared with sham acupuncture (mean difference (MD) -4.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) -12.94 to 4.09, 2 trials, 325 women, low-certainty evidence). Acupuncture may increase satisfaction with pain relief compared to sham acupuncture (risk ratio (RR) 2.38, 95% CI 1.78 to 3.19, 1 trial, 150 women, moderate-certainty evidence), and probably reduces the use of pharmacological analgesia (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.89, 2 trials, 261 women, moderate-certainty evidence). Acupuncture may have no effect on assisted vaginal birth (very low-certainty evidence), and probably little to no effect on caesarean section (low-certainty evidence). Acupuncture compared to usual care We are uncertain if acupuncture reduces pain intensity compared to usual care because the evidence was found to be very low certainty (standardised mean difference (SMD) -1.31, 95% CI -2.14 to -0.49, 4 trials, 495 women, I² = 93%). Acupuncture may have little to no effect on satisfaction with pain relief (low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if acupuncture reduces the use of pharmacological analgesia because the evidence was found to be very low certainty (average RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.85, 6 trials, 1059 women, I² = 70%). Acupuncture probably has little to no effect on assisted vaginal birth (low-certainty evidence) or caesarean section (low-certainty evidence). Acupuncture compared to no treatment One trial compared acupuncture to no treatment. We are uncertain if acupuncture reduces pain intensity (MD -1.16, 95% CI -1.51 to -0.81, 163 women, very low-certainty evidence), assisted vaginal birth or caesarean section because the evidence was found to be very low certainty. Acupuncture compared to sterile water injection We are uncertain if acupuncture has any effect on use of pharmacological analgesia, assisted vaginal birth or caesarean section because the evidence was found to be very low certainty. Acupressure compared to a sham control We are uncertain if acupressure reduces pain intensity in labour (MD -1.93, 95% CI -3.31 to -0.55, 6 trials, 472 women) or assisted vaginal birth because the evidence was found to be very low certainty. Acupressure may have little to no effect on use of pharmacological analgesia (low-certainty evidence). Acupressure probably reduces the caesarean section rate (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.71, 4 trials, 313 women, moderate-certainty evidence). Acupressure compared to usual care We are uncertain if acupressure reduces pain intensity in labour (SMD -1.07, 95% CI -1.45 to -0.69, 8 trials, 620 women) or increases satisfaction with pain relief (MD 1.05, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.35, 1 trial, 105 women) because the evidence was found to be very low certainty. Acupressure may have little to no effect on caesarean section (low-certainty evidence). Acupressure compared to a combined control Acupressure probably slightly reduces the intensity of pain during labour compared with the combined control (measured on a scale of 0 to 10 with low scores indicating less pain) (SMD -0.42, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.18, 2 trials, 322 women, moderate-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if acupressure has any effect on the use of pharmacological analgesia (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.25, 1 trial, 212 women), satisfaction with childbirth, assisted vaginal birth or caesarean section because the certainty of the evidence was all very low. No studies were found that reported on sense of control in labour and only one reported on satisfaction with the childbirth experience.

Authors' Conclusions

Acupuncture in comparison to sham acupuncture may increase satisfaction with pain management and reduce use of pharmacological analgesia. Acupressure in comparison to a combined control and usual care may reduce pain intensity. However, for other comparisons of acupuncture and acupressure, we are uncertain about the effects on pain intensity and satisfaction with pain relief due to very low-certainty evidence. Acupuncture may have little to no effect on the rates of caesarean or assisted vaginal birth. Acupressure probably reduces the need for caesarean section in comparison to a sham control. There is a need for further high-quality research that include sham controls and comparisons to usual care and report on the outcomes of sense of control in labour, satisfaction with the childbirth experience or satisfaction with pain relief.

### Acupuncture or acupressure for induction of labour [^1121epE9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

This is one of a series of reviews of methods of cervical ripening and labour induction. The use of complementary therapies is increasing. Women may look to complementary therapies during pregnancy and childbirth to be used alongside conventional medical practice. Acupuncture involves the insertion of very fine needles into specific points of the body. Acupressure is using the thumbs or fingers to apply pressure to specific points. The limited observational studies to date suggest acupuncture for induction of labour has no known adverse effects to the fetus, and may be effective. However, the evidence regarding the clinical effectiveness of this technique is limited.

Objectives

To determine, from the best available evidence, the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture and acupressure for third trimester cervical ripening or induction of labour.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 November 2016), PubMed (1966 to 25 November 2016), ProQuest Dissertations & Theses (25 November 2016), CINAHL (25 November 2016), Embase (25 November 2016), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Portal (ICTRP) (3 October 2016), and bibliographies of relevant papers.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing acupuncture or acupressure, used for third trimester cervical ripening or labour induction, with placebo/no treatment or other methods on a predefined list of labour induction methods.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data, and checked them for accuracy. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE.

Main Results

This updated review includes 22 trials, reporting on 3456 women. The trials using manual or electro-acupuncture were compared with usual care (eight trials, 760 women), sweeping of membranes (one trial, 207 women), or sham controls (seven trials, 729 women). Trials using acupressure were compared with usual care (two trials, 151 women) or sham controls (two trials, 239 women). Many studies had a moderate risk of bias. Overall, few trials reported on primary outcomes. No trial reported vaginal delivery not achieved within 24 hours and uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate (FHR) changes. Serious maternal and neonatal death or morbidity were only reported under acupuncture versus sham control. Acupuncture versus sham control There was no clear difference in caesarean sections between groups (average risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56 to 1.15, eight trials, 789 women; high-quality evidence). There were no reports of maternal death or perinatal death in the one trial that reported this outcome. There was evidence of a benefit from acupuncture in improving cervical readiness for labour (mean difference (MD) 0.40, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.69, one trial, 125 women), as measured by cervical maturity within 24 hours using Bishop's score. There was no evidence of a difference between groups for oxytocin augmentation, epidural analgesia, instrumental vaginal birth, meconium-stained liquor, Apgar score < 7 at five minutes, neonatal intensive care admission, maternal infection, postpartum bleeding greater than 500 mL, time from the trial to time of birth, use of induction methods, length of labour, and spontaneous vaginal birth. Acupuncture versus usual care There was no clear difference in caesarean sections between groups (average RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.17, eight trials, 760 women; low-quality evidence). There was an increase in cervical maturation for the acupuncture (electro) group compared with control (MD 1.30, 95% CI 0.11 to 2.49, one trial, 67 women) and a shorter length of labour (minutes) in the usual care group compared to electro-acupuncture (MD 124.00, 95% CI 37.39 to 210.61, one trial, 67 women). There appeared be a differential effect according to type of acupuncture based on subgroup analysis. Electro-acupuncture appeared to have more of an effect than manual acupuncture for the outcomes caesarean section (CS), and instrumental vaginal and spontaneous vaginal birth. It decreased the rate of CS (average RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.80, 3 trials, 327 women), increased the rate of instrumental vaginal birth (average RR 2.30, 95%CI 1.15 to 4.60, two trials, 271 women), and increased the rate of spontaneous vaginal birth (average RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.20 to 3.56, one trial, 72 women). However, subgroup analyses are observational in nature and so results should be interpreted with caution. There were no clear differences between groups for other outcomes: oxytocin augmentation, use of epidural analgesia, Apgar score < 7 at 5 minutes, neonatal intensive care admission, maternal infection, perineal tear, fetal infection, maternal satisfaction, use of other induction methods, and postpartum bleeding greater than 500 mL. Acupuncture versus sweeping if fetal membranes One trial of acupuncture versus sweeping of fetal membranes showed no clear differences between groups in caesarean sections (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.22, one trial, 207 women, moderate-quality evidence), need for augmentation, epidural analgesia, instrumental vaginal birth, Apgar score < 7 at 5 minutes, neonatal intensive care admission, and postpartum bleeding greater than 500 mL. Acupressure versus sham control There was no evidence of benefit from acupressure in reducing caesarean sections compared to control (RR, 0.94, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.30, two trials, 239 women, moderate-quality evidence). There was no evidence of a clear benefit in reduced oxytocin augmentation, instrumental vaginal birth, meconium-stained liquor, time from trial intervention to birth of the baby, and spontaneous vaginal birth. Acupressure versus usual care There was no evidence of benefit from acupressure in reducing caesarean sections compared to usual care (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.53, two trials, 151 women, moderate-quality evidence). There was no evidence of a clear benefit in reduced epidural analgesia, Apgar score < 7 at 5 minutes, admission to neonatal intensive care, time from trial intervention to birth of the baby, use of other induction methods, and spontaneous vaginal birth.

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, there was no clear benefit from acupuncture or acupressure in reducing caesarean section rate. The quality of the evidence varied between low to high. Few trials reported on neonatal morbidity or maternal mortality outcomes. Acupuncture showed some benefit in improving cervical maturity, however, more well-designed trials are needed. Future trials could include clinically relevant safety outcomes.

### Use of massage therapy for pain, 2018–2023: a systematic review [^117GtfXD]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Statistical Analysis

Evidence Map

The visual depiction or evidence map uses a bubble plot format to display information on 4 dimensions: bubble size, bubble label, x-axis, and y-axis. This allowed us to provide the following types of information about each included systematic review:

Number of articles in systematic review (bubble size): The size of each bubble corresponds to the number of relevant primary research studies included in a systematic review.
Condition (bubble label): Each bubble is labeled with the condition discussed by that systematic review.
Shapes and colors: Intervention characteristics for each condition are presented in the form of colors (type of intervention) and shapes (comparators). For type of intervention, we included nonspecified massage therapy, tuina, myofascial release, reflexology, acupressure, and auricular acupressure. For comparators, we included mixed comparators with subgroups, mixed comparators with no subgroups, sham or placebo, and active therapy or usual care. A condition can appear more than once if multiple systematic reviews included different type of massage therapy or different comparators.
Strength of findings (rows): Each condition is plotted on the map based on the ratings of certainty of evidence statement as reported in the systematic reviews: high, moderate, low, or very low.
Outcome associated with massage therapy (columns): Each condition is plotted in potential benefit or no benefit as the outcome associated with massage therapy. Columns are not mutually exclusive. A review could have more than 1 conclusion, and conclusions could differ in the benefit associated with massage therapy. Both conclusions are included on the map.

Risk of Bias, Quality Assessment, and Certainty of Evidence

Risk of bias is not part of the method of an evidence map. We assessed the quality of included reviews using criteria developed by the U S Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). Certainty of evidence as determined by the original authors of the systematic review was abstracted for each conclusion in each systematic review and tabulated.

### A comparison between acute pressure block of the sciatic nerve and acupressure: methodology, analgesia, and mechanism involved [^112Ztv2K]. Journal of Pain Research (2013). Low credibility.

Is there a relationship between acupressure and acute pressure block of sciatic nerve method?

Both methods involve application of acute pressure to achieve treatment effects. Both methods alleviate pain and discomfort from a number of diseases. Are these observations attributable to mere coincidence, or does a relationship exist between the two methods?

Ya o yang guan (or waist yang guan), is beneficial for acute sciatica pain and low back pain. This acupuncture point is located below the spinous process of the fourth lumbar vertebra, where branches of the sciatic nerve extend from the spinal cord (Figure 1). As seen in a few studies, effective pressure on any accessible area along the sciatic nerve will provide rapid pain relief, but the effectiveness is reduced if the pressure is applied distant from the sciatic nerve. Is the relief from sciatica pain attributable to stimulation of the acupuncture point or to stimulation of the sciatic nerve?

Acupuncture points shown on the TCM map–are found in areas close to the nerve. Figure 1 displays the sciatic nerve through the low back and leg, as well as the distribution of some acupuncture points on the lower back and leg. Of note, the locations of the sciatic nerve path and the acupuncture points are close to each other. This raises the question of whether acupressure exerts its treatment effect via stimulation of adjacent nerves. Studies have shown that direct stimulation of peripheral nerve sensory fibers increases the pain threshold in a manner similar to that caused by the standard acupuncture technique. Although current scientific research may explain some aspects of TCM, it is far from understanding of the old theory, which was passed down from generation to generation.

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries in adults: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians and American Academy of Family Physicians [^117BDSbZ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

American College of Physicians (ACP) and American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) guideline — For acute musculoskeletal injury pain relief at less than 2 hours, evidence was gathered from 28 RCTs with 4464 patients; moderate-certainty evidence showed that on a 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS), massage therapy reduced pain (weighted mean difference [WMD], −0.70 cm [95% CI, −1.27 to −0.13 cm]), and low-certainty evidence showed that specific acupressure (WMD, −1.59 cm [CI, −2.52 to −0.66 cm]), joint manipulation therapy (WMD, −1.75 cm [CI, −2.68 to −0.81 cm]), and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) (WMD, −1.94 cm [CI, −2.90 to −0.98 cm]) reduced pain versus placebo, while low-certainty evidence showed no statistically significant difference between nonspecific acupressure and placebo; high-certainty evidence showed acetaminophen plus opioids reduced pain (WMD, −0.50 cm [CI, −1.00 to −0.01 cm]) although the effect was small and based on a single study, moderate-certainty evidence showed reductions with acetaminophen alone (WMD, −1.03 cm [CI, −1.82 to −0.24 cm]), acetaminophen plus diclofenac (WMD, −1.11 cm [CI, −2.00 to −0.21 cm]), oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (WMD, −0.93 cm [CI, −1.49 to −0.37 cm]), topical NSAIDs (WMD, −1.02 cm [CI, −1.64 to −0.39 cm]), and topical NSAIDs plus menthol gel (WMD, −1.68 cm [CI, −3.09 to −0.27 cm]); low-certainty evidence also showed that a single dose of tramadol reduced pain (WMD, −3.52 cm [CI, −4.99 to −2.04 cm]) and that acetaminophen plus ibuprofen plus codeine reduced pain (WMD, −1.36 cm [CI, −2.49 to −0.23 cm]) at less than 2 hours.

### Efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions for primary dysmenorrhoea: a systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis [^115k7tno]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2024). High credibility.

We included three trials in acupuncture therapy which adopted no-treatment control, and acupuncture ranked the third in probability analysis. Two trials measured pain intensity (VAS) through the period of 3 cycles, and probably resulted in a reduction of pain intensity compared with control group (3.66 vs 1.68, 4.76 vs 0.05). Another one trial measured outcome post-treatment once time (3.46 vs 0.91 post vs pre). With regard to the mechanism of analgesic effect, acupuncture may repair the inflammatory environment of uterus through nuclear factor-κB signalling pathway. Speculation was also put forward that analgesic effect may be linked to the limbic-paralimbic-neocortical network modulation involving the thalamus.

Interestingly, some researcher associated the analgesic effect of acupuncture with the placebo effect. Within the trials investigating the efficacy of acupuncture, the trials adopted placebo control exerted better efficacy than the trials adopted blank control. Above result suggested that the analgesic effect may contribute to the placebo effect; however, the reliability need further verified. According to our analysis result, short-term analgesic effect (2–3 cycles) of acupuncture was strenuously recognised, whereas the number of qualified trials is relatively scarce.

To our surprise, pairwise analysis of acupressure showed contradictory outcome. When we respectively compared acupressure with two types of control interventions (placebo for two trials and no-treatment for four trials), and consequently the comparison of acupressure versus placebo showed better efficacy than the latter comparison. The discrepancy may be attributed to the different time point of evaluation, in which 3 hours post intervention of placebo-controlled trial. On the contrary, if researcher evaluated outcome after three menstrual cycles treatment, the analgesic effect gradually attenuated. In summary, the optimal treatment period of acupressure may be constrained within 1–3 menstrual cycles.

Lastly, node-splitting analysis was conducted to assess the consistency in network analysis, and the result indicated no significant between-trial heterogeneity in the analysis. In general, heterogeneity is influenced by several factors, such as baseline characteristic, sample size. Among 8 pairwise comparisons of non-pharmacological treatment, 6 comparisons compromising 22 trials showed relatively high heterogeneity (I 2 ≥ 75%). We speculated that the heterogeneity was potentially attributed to small sample size (majority were less than 50). Ensuring the eligible sample size of trials (> 400) is conducive to decrease between-trial heterogeneity and network inconsistency.

### An interventional response phenotyping study in chronic low back pain: protocol for a mechanistic randomized controlled trial [^112LFHQf]. Pain Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Acupressure self-management procedures. The self-administered acupressure intervention will be delivered using the modified MeTime Acupressure mobile app in addition to in-person instruction via study staff. Participants will also receive a hand-held pressure monitor and manual stimulation tool (referred to as an AcuWand; Arbor Medical Innovations, LLC) to be used in association with the acupressure app to help participants apply the correct amount of pressure to acupoints. Study participants will be told to perform acupressure once per day and to stimulate each point a circular motion for 3 minutes. There are 9 acupressure points, totaling 27 minutes of stimulation per day.

Non-opioid pharmacotherapy (duloxetine) overview. Duloxetine is a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) that is FDA-approved for use in cLBP, and, as such, is included as a recommended therapy in nearly all current treatment guidelines for low back pain. Hence, duloxetine is a logical non-opioid analgesic to include in our SMART trial. Duloxetine and other drugs that increase both serotonergic and noradrenergic activity (eg, tricyclics) are thought to work as analgesics by increasing activity in descending anti-nociceptive pathways.

### The effects of ear acupressure, massage therapy and no therapy on symptoms of dementia: a randomized controlled trial [^116d1qDT]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the effectiveness of ear acupressure and massage vs. control in the improvement of pain, anxiety and depression in persons diagnosed with dementia.

Design

A pilot randomized controlled trial.

Setting

Residential homes in Extremadura (Spain).

Subjects

A total of 120 elders with dementia institutionalized in residential homes.

Intervention

The participants were randomly allocated, in three groups. Control group - they continued with their routine activities; ear acupressure intervention group - they received ear acupressure treatment (pressure was applied to acupressure points on the ear); and massage therapy intervention group - they received relaxing massage therapy.

Main Measures

The variables pain, anxiety and depression were assessed with the Doloplus2, Cornell and Campbell scales. The study was carried out during five months; three months of experimental treatment and two months with no treatment. The assessments were done at baseline, each month during the treatment and at one and two months of follow-up. In the statistical analysis the three groups were compared with each other.

Results

A total of 111 participants completed the study. Their aged ranged from 67 to 91years old and 86 of them (77.4%) were women. The ear acupressure intervention group showed better improvements than the massage therapy intervention group in relation to pain and depression during the treatment period and at one month of follow-up. The best improvement in pain was achieved in the last (3rd) month of ear acupressure treatment (p < 0.001) being the average improvement 8.55 (4.39) with IC 95% (7.14, 9.95). Regarding anxiety, the best results were also observed in the last month of treatment. The average improvement in anxiety was 9.63 (5.00) with IC 95% (8.02, 11.23) CONCLUSIONS: Ear acupressure and massage therapy showed better results than the control group in relation to pain, anxiety and depression. However, ear acupressure achieved more improvements.

### Use of massage therapy for pain, 2018–2023: a systematic review [^117RqCG1]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Methods

This systematic review is an extension of a study commissioned by the VA. While not a full systematic review, this study nevertheless reports methods and results using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses reporting guideline where applicable and filed the a priori protocol with the VA Evidence Synthesis Program Coordinating Center. Requirements for review and informed consent were waived because the study was designated as not human participants research.

Literature Search

Literature searches were based on searches used for the evidence map of massage therapy completed in 2018. We searched 5 databases for relevant records published from July 2018 to April 2023 using the search terms "massage", "acupressure", "shiatsu", "myofascial release therapy", "systematic", "metaanaly", and similar terms. The databases were PubMed, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, the Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Web of Science. See eAppendix 1 in Supplement 1 for full search strategies.

Study Selection and Data Collection

Each title was screened independently by 2 authors for relevance (S.M. J. A. and P.G.S.). Abstracts were then reviewed in duplicate, with any discrepancies resolved by group discussion. To be included, abstracts or titles needed to be about efficacy or effectiveness of massage therapy for a painful adult health condition and be a systematic review with more than 1 study about massage therapy. A systematic review was defined as a review that had a documented systematic method for identifying and critically appraising evidence. In general, any therapist-delivered modality described as massage therapy by review authors was considered eligible (eg, tuina, acupressure, auricular acupressure, reflexology, and myofascial release). Sports massage therapy, osteopathy, dry cupping or dry needling, and internal massage therapy (eg, for pelvic floor pain) were ineligible, as were self-administered massage therapy techniques, like foam rolling. Reviews had to be about a painful condition for adults, and we excluded publications in low- and middle-income countries because of differences in resources for usual care or other active treatments for included conditions. Publications were required to compare massage therapy with sham or placebo massage, usual care, or other active therapies. Systematic reviews that covered other interventions were eligible if results for massage therapy were reported separately.

### Review of acupressure studies for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting control [^1117qYTU]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2008). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review was to evaluate the effects of a noninvasive intervention, acupressure, when combined with antiemetics for the control of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). Ten controlled acupressure studies were included in this review. The review evaluated one quasi-experimental and nine randomized clinical trials, which included two specific acupressure modalities, that is, acupressure band and finger acupressure. The effects of the acupressure modalities were compared study by study. Four of seven acupressure band trials supported the positive effects of acupressure, whereas three acupressure band trials yielded negative results regarding the possible effects of acupressure; however, all the studies with negative results had methodological issues. In contrast, one quasi-experimental and two randomized finger acupressure trials all supported the positive effects of acupressure on CINV control. The reported effects of the two acupressure modalities in each phase of CINV produced variable results. Acupressure bands were effective in controlling acute nausea, whereas finger acupressure controlled delayed nausea and vomiting. The overall effect of acupressure was strongly suggestive but not conclusive. Differences in the acupressure modality, the emetic potential of chemotherapeutic agents, antiemetic use, and sample characteristics of each study made study-to-study comparisons difficult. Suggestive effects of acupressure, cost-effectiveness, and the noninvasiveness of the interventions encourage researchers to further investigate the efficacy of this modality. Acupressure should be strongly recommended as an effective, nonpharmacologic adjuvant intervention for CINV control if its positive effects are reproduced in future acupressure clinical trials.

### Acupuncture and related interventions for smoking cessation [^116nD8bZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Acupuncture and related techniques are promoted as a treatment for smoking cessation in the belief that they may reduce nicotine withdrawal symptoms.

Objectives

The objectives of this review are to determine the effectiveness of acupuncture and the related interventions of acupressure, laser therapy and electrostimulation in smoking cessation, in comparison with no intervention, sham treatment, or other interventions.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group specialized register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS Previews, PsycINFO, Science Citation Index, AMED, Acubriefs in November 2010; and four Chinese databases: Chinese Biomedical Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data and VIP in November 2010.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials comparing a form of acupuncture, acupressure, laser therapy or electrostimulation with either no intervention, sham treatment or another intervention for smoking cessation.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data in duplicate on the type of smokers recruited, the nature of the intervention and control procedures, the outcome measures, method of randomization, and completeness of follow up. We assessed abstinence from smoking at the earliest time-point (before six weeks), and at the last measurement point between six months and one year. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. Those lost to follow up were counted as continuing smokers. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We included 33 reports of studies. Compared with sham acupuncture, the fixed-effect risk ratio (RR) for the short-term effect of acupuncture was 1.18 (95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.34), and for the long-term effect was 1.05 (CI 0.82 to 1.35). The studies were not judged to be free from bias. Acupuncture was less effective than nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). There was no evidence that acupuncture is superior to waiting list, nor to psychological interventions in short- or long-term. The evidence on acupressure and laser stimulation was insufficient and could not be combined. The evidence suggested that electrostimulation is not superior to sham electrostimulation.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no consistent, bias-free evidence that acupuncture, acupressure, laser therapy or electrostimulation are effective for smoking cessation, but lack of evidence and methodological problems mean that no firm conclusions can be drawn. Further, well designed research into acupuncture, acupressure and laser stimulation is justified since these are popular interventions and safe when correctly applied, though these interventions alone are likely to be less effective than evidence-based interventions.

### Viral vectors as a novel tool for clinical and neuropsychiatric research applications [^111aWzx3]. General Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

The development of new tools can also help with the development of neuroscience research with Chinese characteristics. In traditional Chinese culture and medicine, many important mechanisms of disease intervention are not clear, such as the physiological and biochemical mechanisms underlying acupuncture, massage and meditation. In addition, a variety of boxing styles in Chinese traditional martial arts have also been proven to improve the symptoms of depression or other mental illness, but the mechanism is still unclear. It is therefore difficult to conduct in-depth research using conventional approaches. In the future, with the help of viral vectors and a series of new technologies, we may bring new treatment ideas and methods, such as exploring the role of acupuncture through optogenetics. Chemical genetics might be employed to continuously activate motor neurons for treating depression. Chinese culture and Chinese medicine are treasures of scientific research. Understanding their mechanisms and making use of them in clinical practice are beneficial for physical health and disease rehabilitation.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^113m33rN]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Physical medicine & rehabilitation — exercise/physical therapy vs or plus massage recommendations state: There is insufficient evidence to determine the efficacy of acupressure compared to a standardized multimodal physical therapy (Grade of Recommendation: I). In the long term, it is suggested that the addition of massage to an exercise program provides no benefit when compared to an exercise program alone (Grade of Recommendation: B). There is insufficient evidence that the addition of massage to an exercise program provides short-term relief of pain (Grade of Recommendation: I).

### Management of fatigue in adult survivors of cancer: ASCO-Society for Integrative Oncology guideline update [^114rA4kS]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Acupressure for cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in adult survivors — phase III randomized evidence — identified one trial in patients at least 12 months post-treatment: among 288 breast cancer survivors, relaxing and stimulating acupressure both significantly improved BFI scores versus usual care at 6 and 10 weeks (P < .001) with no difference between acupressure arms, with mean fatigue reductions of 34%, 27%, and −1% (usual care) after 6 weeks; the trial was at low risk of bias. This recommendation is based on one study conducted in early-stage breast cancer survivors of whom 90% were White women; a separate pilot study in 43 early-stage survivors found relaxing acupressure superior to stimulating acupressure, and self-acupressure is quick to learn, has few and minor adverse effects, is relatively inexpensive, and can be learned via a free self-guided mobile app or a single session with a licensed acupuncturist.

### Acupressure as a non-pharmacological treatment for depression: neurophysiological, biochemical, and psychological mechanisms [^1162yfwn]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Depression is a common and serious psychological disorder with high prevalence and recurrence rates. Still, there are treatment-resistant depression in the clinic, so exploring other treatments is necessary. Acupressure is a non-invasive therapeutic method based on the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, which promotes health and relieves symptoms by applying pressure to specific acupoints on the body. Modern medical research on acupressure has gradually deepened, explaining and validating it through multiple perspectives, e.g., physiology, neurology, and biochemistry. However, the mechanisms underlying the treatment of depression with acupressure, the adoption of a multidisciplinary model of collaboration in treatment, and the improvement of the quality of related research have not yet been thoroughly described. Therefore, the present review summarized the mechanisms, including the neurophysiological, biochemical, and psychological mechanisms behind the treatment of depression with acupressure, its strengths (e.g., no side effects, easy operation, and good patient compliance), and limitations (e.g., individual differences in effects and lack of large-scale systematic studies) in treatment of depression and researches, and its potential for collaboration with other therapies (e.g., acupressure with medication, psychotherapy, and other Chinese medicine), and multidisciplinary approaches.

### The efficacy of acupressure for symptom management: a systematic review [^111iZTwU]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2011). Low credibility.

Context

Acupressure is a noninvasive strategy used to manage various symptoms.

Objectives

The purpose of this article was to review randomized controlled trials that investigated the efficacy of acupressure for the management of symptoms.

Methods

A literature search was conducted in the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Medline, and PubMed using the key words acupressure, clinical trial, human, and/or randomized. Randomized clinical trials published between January 1, 2000 and January 31, 2010, which used acupressure as the sole intervention for one group, were included when they were written in English and when there were four or more studies of the efficacy of acupressure for that particular symptom.

Results

Forty-three studies were included in this review. Investigators in 16 of 23 studies concluded acupressure was effective, primarily for the management of nausea and vomiting in patients during pregnancy and during chemotherapy. Investigators in nine of 10 studies concluded that acupressure was effective for pain in patients with dysmenorrhea, during labor and after trauma. Investigators of four studies concluded that acupressure was effective in the management of dyspnea and investigators in six studies concluded that acupressure was effective in improving fatigue and reducing insomnia in a variety of populations. However, evaluation of the randomized controlled trial reports indicated a significant likelihood of bias.

Conclusion

Acupressure may be a useful strategy for the management of multiple symptoms in a variety of patient populations, but rigorous trials are needed. Inclusion of acupressure as an intervention may improve patient outcomes.

### Clinical evidence for association of acupuncture and acupressure with improved cancer pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114MCDEo]. JAMA Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

The systematic review included 17 RCTs involving 1111 patients with cancer, whereas the meta-analysis included 14 RCTs with 920 patients. Evidence was found of an association between real acupuncture and greater reduction in pain intensity, with a moderate level of certainty. Acupuncture may also be associated with reduced opioid use when added to analgesic therapy. Relatively few adverse events from acupuncture were reported, an observation consistent with findings in previous studies and reviews. The present study provides an updated synthesis of the current evidence of acupuncture and acupressure for cancer pain and identifies research gaps that remain to be addressed.

Consistent with findings of past systematic reviews and meta-analyses, acupuncture was associated with significant reductions in cancer pain in open-label studies. However, the present meta-analysis found acupuncture to be associated with greater pain reduction compared with sham control, which differs from findings of the previous reviews. This difference may be owing to the inclusion of recent high-quality trials. In addition, we applied more stringent inclusion criteria to ensure the quality of source RCTs. Considerable effort was made to conduct an extensive literature search. Seven of the 17 studies were conducted in China, 6 in the United States, and 1 study each in Australia, Brazil, France, and Korea.

### Clinical evidence for association of acupuncture and acupressure with improved cancer pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115pYiCR]. JAMA Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Results

A total of 1607 articles were identified through database searches, from which 1172 duplicate publications (73%) were removed and 418 articles (26%) were excluded for not meeting the inclusion criteria. Seventeen RCTs (1%) were included in the systematic review or qualitative synthesis, (Figure 1 and Table). The study characteristics of these RCTs are summarized in the eTable in the Supplement. Quantitative synthesis was performed with 14 RCTs (82%) by pooling the results through a meta-analysis; these 14 trials involved 920 patients with cancer. Three (18%) of the 17 trials had insufficient data. Seven of the studies (41%) included were conducted in China, 6 (35%) were in the United States, and 1 (6%) each were in Australia, Brazil, France, and Korea.

Summary of Findings

Characteristics of Clinical Studies and Quality of Evidence

Among the 17 RCTs included, 9 (53%) were sham controlled and 8 (47%) were open-label trials. Thirteen studies (76%) employed a 2-group parallel design, 6 of which compared real acupuncture with sham acupuncture, and 7 of which compared the combination of acupuncture and acupressure with analgesic therapy, or usual care. Three 3-group studies (18%) were included; 2 compared real acupuncture with sham acupuncture or wait-list control, and 1 compared acupuncture with 2 kinds of sham control. One RCT (6%) assessed the outcome of acupuncture using an open-label crossover design. Sample sizes ranged from 21 to 226 patients, and a total of 1111 patients were included, with 515 (46%) in the experimental group, 575 (52%) in the control group, and 21 (2%) in the crossover RCT.

### What is the acupoint? A preliminary review of acupoints [^115zsDCY]. Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

According to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory, acupoints are specifically chosen sites of acupuncture manipulation, and also the basis for studying the mechanism of acupuncture. Stimulating different acupoints on the body surface could provide various therapeutic benefits. However, what is the acupoint? This question is not clear.

Review Summary

We focuse on examining the function of acupoints from different perspectives, including the local and the systemic effects of stimulating acupoints. For example, acupoints may release certain substances or incur some changes, which could adjust the function of organs, maintain homeostasis. Furthermore, the therapeutic effects of verum acupoints versus sham acupoints were discussed. However, due to insufficience in evidence and in current methodologies, research into mechanisms of acupuncture is still incomplete.

Conclusion

This review might explain, to some extent, what an acupoint is. Further research into the identity of acupoints is warranted, and multidisciplinary methods using novel technologies may yield significant advances over existing knowledge.

### Clinical evidence for association of acupuncture and acupressure with improved cancer pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1147errq]. JAMA Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Research into acupuncture and acupressure and their application for cancer pain has been growing, but the findings have been inconsistent.

Objective

To evaluate the existing randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for evidence of the association of acupuncture and acupressure with reduction in cancer pain.

Data Sources

Three English-language databases (PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL) and 4 Chinese-language biomedical databases (Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang) were searched for RCTs published from database inception through March 31, 2019.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials that compared acupuncture and acupressure with a sham control, analgesic therapy, or usual care for managing cancer pain were included.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data were screened and extracted independently using predesigned forms. The quality of RCTs was appraised with the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool. Random-effects modeling was used to calculate the effect sizes of included RCTs. The quality of evidence was evaluated with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was pain intensity measured by the Brief Pain Inventory, Numerical Rating Scale, Visual Analog Scale, or Verbal Rating Scale.

Results

A total of 17 RCTs (with 1111 patients) were included in the systematic review, and data from 14 RCTs (with 920 patients) were used in the meta-analysis. Seven sham-controlled RCTs (35%) were notable for their high quality, being judged to have a low risk of bias for all of their domains, and showed that real (compared with sham) acupuncture was associated with reduced pain intensity (mean difference [MD], -1.38 points; 95% CI, -2.13 to -0.64 points; I2 = 81%). A favorable association was also seen when acupuncture and acupressure were combined with analgesic therapy in 6 RCTs for reducing pain intensity (MD, -1.44 points; 95% CI, -1.98 to -0.89; I2 = 92%) and in 2 RCTs for reducing opioid dose (MD, -30.00 mg morphine equivalent daily dose; 95% CI, -37.5 mg to -22.5 mg). The evidence grade was moderate because of the substantial heterogeneity among studies.

Conclusions and Relevance

This systematic review and meta-analysis found that acupuncture and/or acupressure was significantly associated with reduced cancer pain and decreased use of analgesics, although the evidence level was moderate. This finding suggests that more rigorous trials are needed to identify the association of acupuncture and acupressure with specific types of cancer pain and to integrate such evidence into clinical care to reduce opioid use.

### Management of postoperative pain: a clinical practice guideline from the American Pain Society, the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, and the American society of anesthesiologists' committee on regional anesthesia, executive committee, and administrative council [^114p6gU5]. The Journal of Pain (2016). Medium credibility.

Use of physical modalities — recommendations 7 and 8: The panel recommends that clinicians consider transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) as an adjunct to other postoperative pain treatments (weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). A fair-quality systematic review of > 20 randomized trials found use of TENS associated with approximately 25% less postoperative analgesic use compared with no TENS. TENS are small portable devices that deliver low-voltage electrical currents through the skin, and there is insufficient evidence to recommend specific TENS regimens, although effects appear stronger in trials in which TENS was applied using optimal predefined parameters for the stimulation; studies most commonly applied TENS near the surgical incision area, although in some studies TENS was applied to acupoints away from the incision, with similar effects. The panel can neither recommend nor discourage acupuncture, massage, or cold therapy as adjuncts to other postoperative pain treatments (insufficient evidence); evidence on acupressure, auricular acupuncture, and electroacupuncture in adults and needle acupuncture in children is limited and does not clearly show beneficial effects in management of postoperative pain, and evidence on massage was limited, and also did not clearly demonstrate benefits for postoperative pain. Although other physical modalities are generally considered to be safe, lack of demonstrated effectiveness preclude recommendations supporting their use and costs for equipment and care provider time should be considered in relationship to the low probability of patient benefit; cold therapy refers to the superficial application of cold to the surface of the skin, with or without compression and with or without a mechanical recirculating device to maintain cold temperatures.

### Invasive or noninvasive? A systematic review and network meta-analysis of acupuncture and acupressure to treat cancer pain [^114saKgk]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Both acupressure and acupuncture effectively alleviate pain in cancer patients. Acupuncture requires specialized practitioners and is invasive, while acupressure is noninvasive and can be self-administered. Current comparative evidence remains insufficient for clear clinical recommendations.

Aims

To investigate the relative efficacy of acupuncture versus acupressure in alleviating pain among cancer patients.

Methods

This systematic review and network meta-analysis employed a Bayesian framework. Eight major Chinese and English databases were searched from inception to March 1, 2025. Two independent reviewers screened literature, extracted data, and assessed bias in selected studies using the Risk of Bias 2 tool. Network meta-analysis was conducted using R software version 4.4.1.

Results

Thirty-seven RCTs including 3066 patients were analyzed to compare eight treatments: manual acupuncture, transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation, auricular acupressure, electro-acupuncture, acupoint massage, auricular acupuncture, moxibustion, and placebo. Network meta-analysis revealed auricular acupuncture provided the greatest pain score improvement compared to placebo, followed by auricular acupressure and acupoint massage.

Conclusion

Based on our analysis, we recommend auricular acupuncture, auricular acupressure, and acupoint massage for managing cancer pain. While current studies demonstrate potential benefits, limitations include concurrent pain medication use and methodological inconsistencies. Future research should include more robust, single-intervention clinical trials to definitively evaluate efficacy for oncology patients.

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries in adults: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians and American Academy of Family Physicians [^1142eupm]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

American College of Physicians (ACP) and American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) guideline — Recommendation 2b suggests that clinicians treat patients with acute pain from non–low back, musculoskeletal injuries with specific acupressure to reduce pain and improve physical function, or with transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) to reduce pain (Grade: conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). Specific acupressure improved pain at 1 to 7 days and function, but only low-certainty evidence indicated improvement at less than 2 hours; low-certainty evidence suggested that TENS improved pain at less than 2 hours and at 1 to 7 days. The CGC could not determine the net benefit of TENS or specific acupressure and therefore did not use cost considerations to recommend one over the other, and the CGC recommended only interventions that improved at least 2 outcomes, with the exception of acetaminophen plus oral diclofenac because the CGC judged that the combination therapy offered no benefit over single therapy and because the harms noted for single-therapy oral NSAIDs would apply to this combination.

### Use of massage therapy for pain, 2018–2023: a systematic review [^115smRVH]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Of 17 included reviews, 3 reviews included more than 1 type of massage therapy and 14 reviews included 1 type of massage therapy. Reviews by Chou et aland Smith et alincluded acupressure and nonspecified massage therapy as interventions. The review by Candy et alincluded reflexology and nonspecified massage therapy as interventions. Of the 14 reviews with 1 type of massage therapy, there were 5 reviews describing nonspecified massage therapy, 1 review about tuina,5 reviews about myofascial release, and 3 reviews about acupressure.

A variety of comparators were included in reviews. Of 9 reviews that included more than 1 comparator in analyses, 2 reviews did not conduct separate analyses by comparator (labeled mixed with no subgroups), and 3 reviews conducted separate analyses by comparator (labeled mixed with subgroups). The other 4 reviews included a mix of comparators with separate conclusions: sham or placebo and active therapy or usual care, mixed with no subgroups and active therapy or usual care, mixed with subgroups and active therapy or usual care, and mixed with no subgroups, sham, and active therapy or usual care. There were 8 reviews that included 1 comparator only in their analyses, with 7 reviews that described interventions compared with active therapy or usual care only, while 1 review limited inclusion to primary studies with a sham or placebo comparator.

### AAOS / METRC clinical practice guideline summary: pharmacologic, physical, and cognitive pain alleviation for musculoskeletal extremity / pelvis surgery [^1131mVxr]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

Acupressure — limited evidence suggests that auricular acupressure may be used with standard treatment for opioid reduction and improved function; however, there was no difference in pain. Strength of Recommendation: Limited; the Acupressure recommendation has been downgraded two levels because of inconsistent evidence. Three high quality papers focusing on acupressure were evaluated, with two papers showing decreased opioid consumption and improved function versus sham, one of which also showed improved pain and decreased side effects (nausea, vomiting, and dizziness), while a third paper showed no difference in side effects versus sham. Overall, effect size is limited, but low cost and risk weigh positively for considering this treatment; cost/resource needs are minimal though an acupressure-trained professional would need to be hired/available. Acceptability may face some challenge in Western medicine, though acupuncture is more widely acknowledged than in prior decades. Most patients would have no limitation in receiving this treatment, but feasibility may be limited by the number of skilled acupressure professionals available. Increased studies with larger patient populations are encouraged, with better examination of pain, opioid consumption, and functional outcomes after this intervention.

### A randomized controlled clinical trial for low back pain treated by acupressure and physical therapy [^111bVoC5]. Preventive Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Although acupressure has been reported to be effective in managing various types of pain, its efficacy in relieving pain associated with low back pain (LBP) remains unclear. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of acupressure with that of physical therapy in reducing low back pain.

Methods

A randomized controlled clinical trial in an orthopedic referral hospital in Taiwan was conducted between December 20, 2000, and March 2, 2001. A total of 146 participants with chronic low back pain were randomly assigned to the acupressure group (69) or the physical therapy group (77), each with a different treatment technique. Self-appraised pain scores were obtained before treatment as baseline and after treatment as outcomes using the Chinese version of Short-Form Pain Questionnaire (SF-PQ).

Results

There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics among patients randomized into the two groups. The mean of posttreatment pain score after a 4-week treatment (2.28, SD = 2.62) in the acupressure group was significantly lower than that in the physical therapy group (5.05, SD = 5.11) (P = 0.0002). At the 6-month follow-up assessment, the mean of pain score in the acupressure group (1.08, SD = 1.43) was still significantly lower than that in the physical therapy group (3.15, SD = 3.62) (P = 0.0004).

Conclusions

Our results suggest that acupressure is another effective alternative medicine in reducing low back pain, although the standard operating procedures involved with acupressure treatment should be carefully assessed in the future.

### Treatment of low back pain by acupressure and physical therapy: randomised controlled trial [^117Garn2]. BMJ (2006). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness of acupressure in terms of disability, pain scores, and functional status.

Design

Randomised controlled trial.

Setting

Orthopaedic clinic in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.

Participants

129 patients with chronic low back pain.

Intervention

Acupressure or physical therapy for one month.

Main Outcome Measures

Self administered Chinese versions of standard outcome measures for low back pain (primary outcome: Roland and Morris disability questionnaire) at baseline, after treatment, and at six month follow-up.

Results

The mean total Roland and Morris disability questionnaire score after treatment was significantly lower in the acupressure group than in the physical therapy group regardless of the difference in absolute score (- 3.8, 95% confidence interval - 5.7 to - 1.9) or mean change from the baseline (- 4.64, - 6.39 to - 2.89). Acupressure conferred an 89% (95% confidence interval 61% to 97%) reduction in significant disability compared with physical therapy. The improvement in disability score in the acupressure group compared with the physical group remained at six month follow-up. Statistically significant differences also occurred between the two groups for all six domains of the core outcome, pain visual scale, and modified Oswestry disability questionnaire after treatment and at six month follow-up.

Conclusions

Acupressure was effective in reducing low back pain in terms of disability, pain scores, and functional status. The benefit was sustained for six months.

### Classification of acupressure devices under product code "MVV"… [^115SoFLs]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Device Description
- Acupressure devices are used to apply pressure to the Pericardium acupuncture point on the inner wrist. Application of consistent pressure at this point is applied through elastic or via a wrist band, strap, or adhesive strip. A raised wooden or plastic bead or button is often embedded within the band, strap, or strip, which creates a resistive force against the inner wrist. In some devices the amount of pressure can be adjusted. www. fda. gov 3. Indications for Use These devices have been cleared as over-the-counter devices for the following indications for use:

- For the relief of nausea. Nausea may be experienced due to travel, pregnancy, anesthesia, or chemotherapy.
- For the relief of emetic symptoms associated with post-operative anesthesia. www. fda. gov 4.

### Acupuncture and acupressure for premenstrual syndrome [^111RVtPH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acupuncture has a history of traditional use in China for women's health conditions including premenstrual syndrome (PMS), but its effectiveness for this condition remains unclear. This review examined the available evidence supporting the use of acupuncture or acupressure to treat PMS.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture or acupressure for women with PMS or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Studies Online (CENTRAL CRSO), MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, PsycINFO, CINAHL (from inception to 21 September 2017), two clinical trial databases (from their inception to 21 September 2017), and four electronic databases in China (from their inception to 15 October 2017): Chinese Biomedical Literature database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP information/ Chinese Scientific Journals database and WANFANG. Reference lists from included articles were handsearched.

Selection Criteria

We included studies if they randomised women with PMS and associated disorders (PMDD and late luteal phase dysphoric disorder/LPDD) to receive acupuncture or acupressure versus sham, usual care/waiting-list control or pharmaceutical interventions mentioned by the International Society for Premenstrual Disorders (ISPMD). If acupuncture or acupressure were combined with another therapy, these studies were also included where the additional therapy was the same in both groups. Cross-over studies were eligible for inclusion, but only data from the first phase could be used.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected the studies, assessed eligible studies for risk of bias, and extracted data from each study. Study authors were contacted for missing information. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. Our primary outcomes were overall premenstrual symptoms and adverse events. Secondary outcomes included specific PMS symptoms, response rate and quality of life.

Main Results

Five trials (277 women) were included in this review. No trials compared acupuncture or acupressure versus other active treatments. The number of treatment sessions ranged from seven to 28. The quality of the evidence ranged from low to very low quality, the main limitations being imprecision due to small sample sizes and risk of bias related to detection bias and selective reporting. Acupuncture versus sham acupunctureAcupuncture may provide a greater reduction in mood-related PMS symptoms (mean difference (MD) -9.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) -10.71 to -7.35, one randomised controlled trial (RCT), n = 67, low-quality evidence) and in physical PMS symptoms (MD -9.11, 95% CI -10.82 to -7.40, one RCT, n = 67, low-quality evidence) than sham acupuncture, as measured by the Daily Record of Severity of Problems scale (DRSP). The evidence suggests that if women have a mood score of 51.91 points with sham acupuncture, their score with acupuncture would be between 10.71 and 7.35 points lower and if women have a physical score of 46.11 points, their score with acupuncture would be between 10.82 and 7.4 points lower. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether there was any difference between the groups in the rate of adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 1.74, 95% CI 0.39 to 7.76, three RCTs, n = 167, I² = 0%, very low-quality evidence). Specific PMS symptoms were not reportedThere may be little or no difference between the groups in response rates. Use of a fixed-effect model suggested a higher response rate in the acupuncture group than in the sham group (RR 2.59, 95% CI 1.71 to 3.92; participants = 100; studies = 2; I² = 82%), but owing to the high heterogeneity we tested the effect of using a random-effects model, which provided no clear evidence of benefit for acupuncture (RR 4.22, 95% CI 0.45 to 39.88, two RCTs, n = 100, I² = 82%, very low-quality evidence). Acupuncture may improve quality of life (measured by the WHOQOL-BREF) compared to sham (MD 2.85, 95% CI 1.47 to 4.23, one RCT, n = 67, low-quality evidence). Acupuncture versus no treatmentDue to the very low quality of the evidence, we are uncertain whether acupuncture reduces PMS symptoms compared to a no treatment control (MD -13.60, 95% CI -15.70 to -11.50, one RCT, n = 14). No adverse events were reported in either group. No data were available on specific PMS symptoms, response rate or quality of life outcomes. Acupressure versus sham acupressureWe found low-quality evidence that acupressure may reduce the number of women with moderate to severe PMS symptoms at the end of the trial compared to sham acupressure (RR 0.64 95% CI 0.52 to 0.79, one RCT, n = 90, low-quality evidence). The evidence suggests that if 97 women out of 100 in the sham acupressure group had moderate to severe PMS symptoms, the number of women in the acupressure group with moderate to severe symptoms would be 50 to 76 women. Acupressure may improve both physical (MD 24.3, 95% CI 17.18 to 31.42, one RCT, n = 90, low-quality evidence) and mental (MD 17.17, 95% CI 13.08 to 21.26, one RCT, n = 90, low-quality evidence) quality of life. No data were available on adverse events, specific symptoms or response rates.

Authors' Conclusions

The limited evidence available suggests that acupuncture and acupressure may improve both physical and psychological symptoms of PMS when compared to a sham control. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether there was a difference between the groups in rates of adverse events. There is no evidence comparing acupuncture or acupressure versus current ISPMD recommended treatments for PMS such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Further research is required, using validated outcome measures for PMS, adequate blinding and suitable comparator groups reflecting current best practice.

### Acupressure bands are effective in reducing radiation therapy-related nausea [^111nAppd]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2009). Low credibility.

Previous studies have shown that acupressure bands can reduce chemotherapy-related nausea. Patients' expectations of efficacy account for part of this outcome. We conducted a three-arm randomized clinical trial to investigate the effectiveness of acupressure bands in controlling radiation therapy-induced nausea and to test whether an informational manipulation designed to increase expectation of efficacy would enhance the effectiveness of the acupressure bands. Patients who experienced nausea at prior treatments were randomized to either standard care (Arm 1, n = 29) or standard care plus acupressure bands with either neutral (Arm 2, n = 30) or positive (Arm 3, n = 29) information regarding the efficacy of the bands. Patients reported nausea for two days prior to randomization (baseline) and for five days following using a seven-point semantic rating scale (1 = not nauseated to 7 = extremely nauseated). Patients in Arms 2 and 3 combined reported greater reduction in average nausea than patients in Arm 1 (P = 0.01; mean(bands) = 0.70, mean(no bands) = 0.10). This equates to a 23.8% decrease in nausea in the band groups compared to a 4.8% decrease in the control group, a 19% difference. The informational manipulation failed to alter efficacy expectations and there was no statistically significant difference in nausea between patients in Arms 2 and 3. Acupressure bands are an effective, low-cost, nonintrusive, well-accepted, and safe adjunct to standard antiemetic medication. An attempt to boost the efficacy of the acupressure bands by providing positive information was not successful.

Data Extraction and Quality Assessment

All data extraction was independently undertaken by 2 of us (Y.H. and X.G.) using predesigned forms. Clinical features (participants, interventions, and outcome measurements), details of the treatments, methodological characteristics, and the results of each outcome were extracted for each study. Two of us (Y.H. and Y.L.) independently appraised the quality of studies included, and disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus with another reviewer (A.L.Z.). Each RCT was assigned a low, high, or unclear risk of bias for 6 specific domains (sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other potential threats), using information identified from the published articles and supplementary materials and by contacting the study authors when needed.

### Impact of acupressure combined with flexible pressure sensor manometry on anesthesia recovery in patients undergoing bronchoalveolar lavage: a randomized controlled trial [^113R8KXv]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, acupressure is an effective adjunctive method for relieving cough during anesthesia recovery in patients undergoing BAL. It reduces the need for medication to manage cough, enhances patient comfort, and is safe, with no associated risks. The therapy also shortens the duration of recovery in the PACU and lowers the incidence of common postoperative complications such as stress urinary incontinence and tachycardia. As a non-invasive and low-risk intervention, acupressure offers a promising alternative to traditional treatments for managing postoperative cough.

### Integrative oncology care of symptoms of anxiety and depression in adults with cancer: Society for Integrative Oncology-ASCO guideline [^115TyW9x]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Integrative oncology anxiety and depression — diversity in populations and therapies is encouraged. The Expert Panel encourages researchers to focus on people with more diverse socioeconomic and racial backgrounds and on cancer types other than breast. Greater diversity is also needed in the therapies studied, including commonly used and accessible options such as natural products, healing touch, reflexology, acupressure, and creative therapies, and more rigorous study of these therapies is warranted.

### Acupuncture (PDQ ®)-NCI-national cancer institute… [^1133MtjD]. NCI (2005). Low credibility.

Chinese medicine proposes that the purpose of acupuncture therapy is to normalize energy flow, thereby relieving the symptoms by stimulating specific sites on the meridians. In acupuncture treatment, stainless steel needles, usually ranging from 0. 22 mm to
0. 25 mm in diameter, are inserted into relevant acupuncture points to stimulate the affected meridians. 26] In 1997, NIH held a Consensus Development Conference on acupuncture to evaluate its safety and efficacy. The 12-member panel concluded that promising research results showing the efficacy of acupuncture in certain conditions have emerged and that further research is likely to uncover additional areas in which acupuncture intervention will be useful. The panel stated that "there is clear evidence that needle acupuncture treatment is effective for postoperative and chemotherapy N/V".

Acupuncture "may also activate the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, resulting in a broad spectrum of systemic effects, " including "alterations in peptides, hormones and neurotransmitters and the regulation of blood flow. " The effect of acupuncture on chronic inflammatory pain has been studied. Evidence suggests that acupuncture operates through the autonomic nervous system to balance the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems and suggests that the anti-inflammatory effects of acupuncture are mediated by its electrophysiologic effects on neurotransmitters, cytokines, and neuropeptides. 42–46] These studies were limited by small sample size and occasional conflicting results. Acupuncture has been associated with significant changes in proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1-beta, IL-6, IL-17, and TNF-alpha. In addition, studies showed that acupuncture needle manipulation stimulated surrounding connective tissues and sensory nerves and affected adenosine-mediated peripheral sensory modulation.

A 2018 retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of 375 cancer survivors who received acupuncture treatments at the MD Anderson Cancer Center Integrative Medicine Center outpatient clinic showed that patients experienced short- and long-term improvement in multiple symptoms including hot flashes, fatigue, numbness, tingling, and nausea.

### Clinical evidence for association of acupuncture and acupressure with improved cancer pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1146d5Di]. JAMA Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Outcomes of Acupuncture and Acupressure

With regard to pain intensity (Figure 2), pooled results from 7 blinded studies showed the association between pain reduction and real acupuncture rather than between pain reduction and sham acupuncture with substantial heterogeneity (mean difference, −1.38 points; 95% CI, −2.13 to −0.64; I² = 81%). Data from the 6 open-label RCTs showed the reduction in pain intensity was associated with a combination of acupuncture and acupressure when compared with analgesic therapy with considerable heterogeneity (mean difference, −1.44 points; 95% CI, −1.98 to −0.89; I² = 92%). Significant reduction without heterogeneity was found in 3 studies that compared acupuncture with wait-list controls (mean difference, −1.63 points; 95% CI, −2.14 to −1.13) (Figure 2). Two open-label studies, reported the maintenance dose of analgesics during the trial, and the pooled results showed a significant decrease in analgesic dose in the integrative medicine group (acupuncture plus analgesic therapy) compared with the control group that received analgesics alone (mean difference, −30.00 mg morphine equivalent daily dose; 95% CI, −37.5 mg to −22.5 mg), without heterogeneity.

The squares show the results of each subgroup analysis, and the diamond indicates the pooled effect size of all subgroups. NA indicates not applicable.

In the subgroup analyses for intervention type (Figure 2), the pooled result of sham-controlled RCTs favored manual acupuncture (3 studies) with reduced heterogeneity (mean difference, −0.88 points; 95% CI, −1.75 to −0.01; I² = 59%) and auricular acupuncture (2 studies) with increased effect size (mean difference, −2.98 points; 95% CI, −5.37 to −0.59; I² = 84%). By pooling the 2 open-label studies on acupressure, the effect size increased with reduced heterogeneity (mean difference, −1.75 points; 95% CI, −2.07 to −1.43; I² = 64%) (Figure 2).

### Minute sphere acupressure does not reduce postoperative pain or morphine consumption [^112aczWo]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2003). Low credibility.

Minute sphere acupressure has been used for more than 2000 yr and remains popular in Japan. The points most relevant to abdominal surgery are those associated with meridian flows crossing or originating in the abdomen. We tested the hypothesis that minute sphere therapy reduces pain and analgesic requirements after open abdominal surgery. Participating patients were given standardized desflurane and fentanyl anesthetic. On completion of surgery, they were randomly assigned to untreated control or minute sphere acupressure at the Neiguan, Zusanli, Sanyinjiao, and Gongsun points. Each site was covered with bulky gauze dressings so that patients could not determine their assignments. Postoperative pain was treated with IV morphine via a patient-controlled analgesia pump. Our primary a priori end-points were pain and opioid consumption on the first postoperative morning. Data are reported as median (25th percentile, 75th percentile). Fifty-three patients (30 controls and 23 minute spheres) completed the study. Morphine requirements (47 mg [27, 58] vs 41 mg [25, 69]) and pain scores (29.5 mm [16, 59] vs 40 mm [22, 58]) were similar in the control and acupressure groups. These data provide an 80% power for detecting a 50% difference in morphine consumption at an alpha of 0.05. Minute sphere treatment at the Neiguan, Zusanli, Sanyinjiao, and Gongsun points thus failed to provide analgesia after abdominal surgery. Minute sphere therapy is a form of acupuncture. We tested whether minute spheres placed on three acupressure points relevant to abdominal surgery reduced pain and morphine requirements after abdominal surgery. Treatment and control patients received a similar covering. Neither pain nor morphine requirements were different between the groups.
