## Question

Is methimazole indicated for Addison disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether methimazole is indicated for Addison's disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled indications and mechanism of action of methimazole. Then, I should review the pathophysiology and standard treatment of Addison's disease. Next, I will compare the endocrine axes involved to ensure there isn't a mechanistic overlap. After that, I should check for any exceptional or off-label uses that could create confusion. Finally, I will confirm safety considerations and restate a clear conclusion with appropriate therapy recommendations for Addison's disease.

> Let me first confirm methimazole's indication and mechanism to avoid any incorrect assumptions. Methimazole is an antithyroid thionamide that inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis and is indicated for hyperthyroidism such as Graves' disease or toxic multinodular goiter; it is also used to render patients euthyroid prior to radioactive iodine or thyroidectomy, but it does not affect adrenal steroidogenesis, which is a separate pathway entirely [^1146RYUZ] [^115Eayrr] [^114us8zP]. Hold on, I should verify whether any thyroid-focused guidelines suggest adrenal indications; they do not, and the American Thyroid Association confirms its role strictly within hyperthyroidism management algorithms, not adrenal insufficiency [^114us8zP].

> Next, I should review Addison's disease pathophysiology and its standard treatments to ensure precision. Primary adrenal insufficiency is characterized by deficient cortisol and often aldosterone due to adrenal cortical destruction; definitive management requires physiologic glucocorticoid replacement (e.g., hydrocortisone) and mineralocorticoid replacement (e.g., fludrocortisone) with individualized titration, and emerging data also discuss modified-release hydrocortisone to better mimic diurnal cortisol profiles, none of which involves antithyroid drugs [^111JNM3m] [^115kH9N4]. Wait, let me verify clinical features and urgency: Addison's can be insidious yet life-threatening in stress states, underscoring the necessity for timely steroid replacement rather than any thyroid-directed therapy [^113iQ2km].

> I will now examine whether there is any plausible overlap in endocrine axes that might justify methimazole in Addison's disease. Methimazole acts on the thyroidal HPT axis to reduce excess thyroid hormone synthesis, whereas Addison's disease is an HPA axis disorder with hypocortisolism and hypoaldosteronism; these are mechanistically distinct systems with different hormonal defects, so methimazole does not address the hormone deficiencies in Addison's disease and could only risk inducing hypothyroidism if misapplied [^114us8zP] [^111gcWCT]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm no indirect adrenal effects have been demonstrated for methimazole, and none are described in labeling or guidelines [^1146RYUZ] [^114us8zP].

> But wait, what if there are exceptional or off-label uses that might confuse the picture. I need to check for reports where methimazole and Addison's co-occur; in polyglandular autoimmune settings, patients may require methimazole for Graves' disease and steroid replacement for Addison's concurrently, which shows parallel management of distinct diseases rather than cross-utility of methimazole for adrenal insufficiency [^115gdivR] [^1115i2GQ]. Hmm, wait a minute, topical methimazole has been reported for melasma, but that dermatologic use is unrelated to adrenal function and doesn't translate to Addison's treatment [^114Pjx5v].

> Now, I should address a phrasing point in the draft to ensure clinical accuracy. The draft states "methimazole is contraindicated for Addison's disease", but let me verify the formal contraindications; label contraindications focus on hypersensitivity and do not list Addison's disease, so the precise statement should be that methimazole is not indicated for Addison's disease rather than formally contraindicated by labeling, and I should correct that wording while preserving the clinical intent [^114Tr2nn]. I should also double-check key safety issues: methimazole can cause agranulocytosis and hepatotoxicity, may precipitate hypothyroidism if overdosed, and has regulatory cautions around drug-induced pancreatitis signals; none of these risks would be justified in an adrenal insufficiency scenario where there is no therapeutic benefit [^113rBXgo] [^113wKUrJ] [^1117TvnC].

> Let me reconsider the core therapeutic implications to ensure no gaps. Addison's disease requires lifelong glucocorticoid and, when needed, mineralocorticoid replacement tailored to clinical status, with education on stress dosing and monitoring; this is supported by pediatric and adult literature as well as interventional studies on hydrocortisone formulations, and again there is no role for antithyroid agents in correcting hypocortisolism or hypoaldosteronism [^111gcWCT] [^115kH9N4]. I should confirm that no guideline endorses methimazole for adrenal insufficiency, and I find none [^114us8zP].

> Conclusion and correction preserved: Methimazole is not indicated for Addison's disease; while I initially echoed the phrasing "contraindicated", I should clarify that labeling does not list Addison's as a formal contraindication, but there is no indication or mechanistic rationale for its use in primary adrenal insufficiency. Standard care for Addison's disease is glucocorticoid replacement (e.g., hydrocortisone) and mineralocorticoid replacement (fludrocortisone), with individualized dosing and monitoring, not antithyroid therapy [^114Tr2nn] [^111gcWCT] [^115kH9N4].

Methimazole is **not used for Addison disease** because it has no role in adrenal insufficiency [^111JNM3m] and can cause serious adverse effects that may worsen Addison's disease. Methimazole is an **antithyroid drug for hyperthyroidism** [^1146RYUZ] and is not indicated for adrenal disorders [^114us8zP]. Addison's disease is treated with **glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement**, not antithyroid drugs [^111JNM3m]. Methimazole can cause agranulocytosis [^111Y1Baw], hepatotoxicity [^113wKUrJ], and hypothyroidism [^112x2T5V], which can complicate Addison's management. If a patient has both Addison's and hyperthyroidism [^114us8zP], treat each separately with standard therapies [^111JNM3m].

## Pharmacological properties of methimazole

Methimazole **inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis** by blocking thyroid peroxidase [^115Eayrr], reducing iodination of tyrosine residues and thyroid hormone production. It is orally absorbed, hepatically metabolized, and renally excreted [^115Eayrr]. It is indicated for hyperthyroidism [^1146RYUZ] due to Graves' disease or toxic multinodular goiter and for preparation before thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine therapy [^111n8Vtq].

---

## Pathophysiology and treatment of Addison disease

Addison's disease is **primary adrenal insufficiency** [^111JNM3m] resulting from autoimmune destruction of the adrenal cortex, causing cortisol and aldosterone deficiency. It presents with fatigue, weight loss, hypotension, hyperpigmentation, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia [^113iQ2km]. Standard treatment is **lifelong glucocorticoid (e.g. hydrocortisone) and mineralocorticoid (e.g. fludrocortisone) replacement** to normalize cortisol and aldosterone [^111vpgBK].

---

## Methimazole and Addison disease: clinical considerations

Methimazole is **not indicated for Addison's disease** [^114us8zP] and has no therapeutic role in adrenal insufficiency; its action is limited to inhibiting thyroid hormone synthesis [^115Eayrr] and is unrelated to adrenal hormone production or regulation.

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects of methimazole in Addison disease

Methimazole can cause **serious adverse effects** that may worsen Addison's disease:

- **Agranulocytosis**: Life-threatening neutropenia increasing infection risk, particularly dangerous in immunocompromised patients [^11329dYA] [^113rBXgo].

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Liver injury, including cholestatic jaundice and acute liver failure, complicating Addison's management [^112x2T5V] [^115Jzxos].

- **Hypothyroidism**: Overtreatment can cause hypothyroidism, further complicating adrenal insufficiency management [^112x2T5V] [^111Y1Baw].

- **Vasculitis**: ANCA-positive vasculitis with severe complications, including renal and pulmonary involvement [^112x2T5V].

These risks outweigh any hypothetical benefit; methimazole is **not recommended for Addison's disease** [^1146RYUZ].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

No clinical guidelines or expert recommendations support **methimazole use in Addison's disease**; it is indicated only for **hyperthyroidism** [^114us8zP] [^111n8Vtq], while Addison's disease is managed with **glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement** [^111JNM3m].

---

## Alternative treatments for Addison disease

Effective, evidence-based alternatives to methimazole for Addison's disease include:

- **Glucocorticoid replacement**: Hydrocortisone or prednisone to replace cortisol [^111JNM3m].

- **Mineralocorticoid replacement**: Fludrocortisone to replace aldosterone [^111vpgBK].

- **Patient education**: Stress dosing and emergency management to prevent adrenal crises [^113iQ2km].

---

## Clinical scenarios involving methimazole and Addison disease

In patients with coexisting hyperthyroidism (e.g. Graves' disease) and Addison's disease, methimazole is used **only for hyperthyroidism** [^114us8zP]; Addison's disease should be managed separately with appropriate hormone replacement therapy [^1115i2GQ].

---

Methimazole is not used for Addison's disease because it does not address **adrenal insufficiency** [^111JNM3m] and can cause **serious adverse effects** [^113rBXgo] that may worsen Addison's disease. Addison's disease should be managed with glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement therapy [^111vpgBK], and methimazole should only be used for hyperthyroidism when indicated [^114us8zP].

### Hyponatraemia and hyperpigmentation in primary adrenal insufficiency [^113LiPnU]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Early recognition of Morbus Addison is of vital importance because hypocortisolism can be a life-threatening condition in cases of physical stress, as activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is an essential response during illness. Furthermore, Morbus Addison often presents with non-specific symptoms, which makes hyperpigmentation an important clue in the diagnosis.

- **Learning points**:
	- Hyponatraemia can be the first presentation of Morbus Addison.
	- In patients with hyponatraemia and co-morbidity predisposing to SIADH, adrenal insufficiency should always be considered as a contributory factor or primary cause.
	- Hyperpigmentation caused by increased production of α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone can be a vital clue to consider primary hypocortisolism, also when other serious co-morbidity is present.
	- Hyperpigmentation in this case of Morbus Addison resolved within two weeks after starting cortisol replacement therapy.

### Best practices in the laboratory diagnosis, prognostication, prediction, and monitoring of Graves' disease: Role of TRAbs [^115V7jH8]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

A scoring system was constructed and validated for predicting the risk of recurrent Graves' disease (reGD) after 18 months of antithyroid drug (ATD) therapy using four baseline variables: age, serum fT4, TRAbs, and goitre size. The resultant GREAT (Graves' ReEvents After Therapy) score of 0–1, 2–3, and 4–6 was associated with a recurrence risk of 16%, 44%, and 68%, respectively. Thus, by considering baseline TRAbs in addition to clinical variables such as age, gender, thyroid volume, and severity of hyperthyroidism, it is possible to identify and stratify patients into categories with low or high risk of remission following treatment, as well as predict the prognosis and recurrence of GD.

As an extension to this observation, recording baseline TRAbs will also help in counseling patients about the possible duration of therapy, the importance of medication adherence, and treatment outcomes, thereby allowing informed decision-making on the part of the patient regarding the most appropriate format of thyrotoxicosis therapy.

- **Treatment monitoring and follow-up**: Treatment of thyrotoxicosis arising from GD hinges on the principles of reducing T3 and T4 synthesis from the thyroid gland. This is achieved by using modalities such as antithyroid drugs (ATDs) including methimazole (MMI), carbimazole (CBZ), and propylthiouracil (PTU), or by thyroid ablation using radioactive iodine (RAI) or thyroidectomy. ATDs are the first-line therapy for GD in most patients, especially younger ones, and also for achieving euthyroid status prior to RAI or thyroidectomy. Upon initiation of ATD therapy, secondary to their suppressant effects…

### Improved urinary cortisol metabolome in Addison disease: A prospective trial of dual-release hydrocortisone [^115kH9N4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). High credibility.

11β-HSD2 is mainly expressed in the kidneys and protects the mineralocorticoid receptor from cortisol occupancy by inactivating cortisol to cortisone. Animal models and human studies suggest a role for 11β-HSD2 in salt-sensitive hypertension. The increased 11β-HSD2 activity observed with DR-HC may play a role in the reduced blood pressure observed in patients.

When treated with either TID-HC or DR-HC, patients had higher 5β-reductase activity compared to controls. It has been suggested that 5β-reductase activity might be induced by GCs. In contrast to 5α-reductase, whose activity was not markedly modified in our patients, 5β-reductase has been less well studied in metabolic disorders. Activation of 5β-reductase has been correlated with fat accumulation in the liver. In polycystic ovary syndrome, activation of this enzyme is observed in patients harboring a marked androgen excess. Its expression is markedly suppressed in diabetic patients as a consequence of an activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α. Recent data derived from hepatoma cell lines suggested that inactivation of 5β-reductase led to activation of lipogenic and carbohydrate genes, whereas mice harboring homozygous inactivation of the gene had increased insulin sensitivity, and males were leaner. These limited data suggest modulation of 5β-reductase activity could also contribute to modification of the metabolic profile of patients.

### Successful treatment of hydroquinone-resistant melasma using topical methimazole [^114Pjx5v]. Dermatologic Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Melasma is an acquired hyperpigmentation skin disorder in sun-exposed areas and occurs almost exclusively over the face. It is most commonly seen in women. Several depigmenting agents have been used for the treatment of melasma, among which hydroquinone has been the most widely used due to its efficacy and safety in short-term use. However, hydroquinone has recently been reported to be a cytotoxic and mutagenic compound in mammalian cells and is thus banned in several countries. This ban has prompted investigators to search for alternative depigmenting agents for the treatment of melasma in recent years.

Methimazole, an antithyroid agent, has been used orally in humans for several decades. It has been shown that when applied topically, it inhibits melanin synthesis and causes skin depigmentation in lab animals as well as human subjects. Herein, we report two hydroquinone-resistant melasma patients who were successfully treated with methimazole cream. Application of 5% methimazole cream once daily resulted in significant improvement of melasma in both patients after 8 weeks. The efficacy of methimazole for melasma treatment, as well as its advantages over other known depigmenting compounds (non-mutagenicity, non-cytotoxicity, and high tolerability profile), suggests that topical methimazole should be added to the armamentarium of anti-melasma treatment.

### Hyperthyroidism (primary) [^115u1JGr]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Low credibility.

Hyperthyroidism is characterized by high levels of serum thyroxine and triiodothyronine, and low levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone. The main causes of hyperthyroidism are Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goitre, and toxic adenoma. About 20 times more women than men have hyperthyroidism.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of drug treatments for primary hyperthyroidism? What are the effects of surgical treatments for primary hyperthyroidism? What are the effects of treatments for subclinical hyperthyroidism? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 14 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: adding thyroxine to antithyroid drugs (carbimazole, propylthiouracil, and thiamazole), antithyroid drugs (carbimazole, propylthiouracil, and thiamazole), radioactive iodine, and thyroidectomy.

### Desensitization to methimazole [^11355B2J]. Endocrine Practice (2021). Low credibility.

Thionamides, such as methimazole and propylthiouracil, are associated with common side effects, like rash and pruritus, and rare but serious adverse effects, including agranulocytosis and hepatotoxicity. Methimazole is typically the preferred thionamide for treating hyperthyroidism if the patient is not planning to conceive or is not in the first trimester of pregnancy, due to its less frequent dosing and lower risk of hepatotoxicity. For patients who experience rash or itching from methimazole, switching to propylthiouracil is a potential treatment option. This report details our experience with desensitization to methimazole as an alternative management strategy.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients at a single institution who experienced side effects from methimazole and underwent desensitization supervised by an allergist. The study included 7 patients who had side effects from methimazole, excluding agranulocytosis and hepatotoxicity.

- **Results**: All 7 patients were able to continue methimazole treatment for their hyperthyroidism, either as part of ongoing medical therapy or as a bridge to definitive therapy, via surgery or radioactive iodine treatment.

- **Conclusion**: Supervised by an allergist, desensitization to methimazole is a feasible option for patients experiencing side effects from methimazole, excluding cases of agranulocytosis and hepatotoxicity.

### Extended exome sequencing identifies BACH2 as a novel major risk locus for Addison's disease [^1135YfAf]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Autoimmune disease is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In Addison's disease, the adrenal glands are targeted by destructive autoimmunity. Despite being the most common cause of primary adrenal failure, little is known about its aetiology.

- **Methods**: To understand the genetic background of Addison's disease, we utilized the extensively characterized patients of the Swedish Addison Registry. We developed an extended exome capture array comprising a selected set of 1853 genes and their potential regulatory elements, for the purpose of sequencing 479 patients with Addison's disease and 1394 controls.

- **Results**: We identified BACH2 (rs62408233-A, OR = 2.01 [1.71–2.37], P = 1.66 × 10⁻¹⁵, MAF 0.46/0.29 in cases/controls) as a novel gene associated with Addison's disease development. We also confirmed the previously known associations with the HLA complex.

- **Conclusion**: Whilst BACH2 has been previously reported to associate with organ-specific autoimmune diseases co-inherited with Addison's disease, we have identified BACH2 as a major risk locus in Addison's disease, independent of concomitant autoimmune diseases. Our results may enable future research towards preventive disease treatment.

### Antithyroid drugs inhibit thyroid hormone receptor-mediated transcription [^1158d2Ct]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Methimazole (MMI) and propylthiouracil (PTU) are widely used as antithyroid drugs (ATDs) for the treatment of Graves' disease. Both MMI and PTU reduce thyroid hormone levels by several mechanisms, including inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion. In addition, PTU decreases 5'-deiodination of T₄ in peripheral tissues. ATDs may also interfere with T₃ binding to nuclear thyroid hormone receptors (TRs); however, the effect of ATDs on the transcriptional activities of T₃ mediated by TRs has not been studied.

The present study was undertaken to determine whether ATDs have an effect on the gene transcription regulated by T₃ and TRs in vitro. Transient gene expression experiments and GH secretion assays were performed. To elucidate possible mechanisms of the antagonistic action of ATDs, the interaction between TR and nuclear cofactors was examined.

- **Results**: In the transient gene expression experiments, both MMI and PTU significantly suppressed transcriptional activities mediated by the TR and T₃ in a dose-dependent manner. In mammalian two-hybrid assays, both drugs recruited one of the nuclear corepressors, nuclear receptor corepressor, to the TR in the absence of T₃. In addition, PTU dissociated nuclear coactivators, such as steroid receptor coactivator-1 and glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein-1, from the TR in the presence of T₃. Finally, MMI decreased the GH release that was stimulated by T₃.

In conclusion, ATDs inhibit T₃ action by recruitment of transcriptional corepressors and/or dissociation of coactivators.

### Hyperthyroidism: Diagnosis and treatment [^113Lrsiq]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Hyperthyroidism is an excessive concentration of thyroid hormones in tissues caused by increased synthesis of thyroid hormones, excessive release of preformed thyroid hormones, or an endogenous or exogenous extrathyroidal source. The most common causes of an excessive production of thyroid hormones are Graves disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and toxic adenoma. The most common cause of an excessive passive release of thyroid hormones is painless (silent) thyroiditis, although its clinical presentation is the same as with other causes.

Hyperthyroidism caused by overproduction of thyroid hormones can be treated with antithyroid medications (methimazole and propylthiouracil), radioactive iodine ablation of the thyroid gland, or surgical thyroidectomy. Radioactive iodine ablation is the most widely used treatment in the United States. The choice of treatment depends on the underlying diagnosis, the presence of contraindications to a particular treatment modality, the severity of hyperthyroidism, and the patient's preference.

### Methimazole [^113rBXgo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Methimazole crosses the placental membranes and can cause fetal harm when administered in the first trimester of pregnancy. Rare instances of congenital defects, including aplasia cutis, craniofacial malformations (such as facial dysmorphism and choanal atresia), gastrointestinal malformations (such as esophageal atresia with or without tracheoesophageal fistula), omphalocele, and abnormalities of the omphalomesenteric duct, have occurred in infants born to mothers who received methimazole tablets in the first trimester of pregnancy. If methimazole tablets are used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be warned of the potential hazard to the fetus.

Due to the risk for congenital malformations associated with the use of methimazole tablets in the first trimester of pregnancy, it may be appropriate to use other agents in pregnant women requiring treatment for hyperthyroidism. If methimazole tablets are used, the lowest possible dose to control the maternal disease should be given.

- **Agranulocytosis**: Agranulocytosis is a potentially life-threatening adverse reaction of methimazole therapy. Patients should be instructed to immediately report to their physicians any symptoms suggestive of agranulocytosis, such as fever or sore throat. Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and aplastic anemia (pancytopenia) may also occur. The drug should be discontinued in the presence of agranulocytosis or aplastic anemia (pancytopenia), and the patient's bone marrow indices should be monitored.

### Control of Graves' hyperthyroidism with very long-term methimazole treatment: a clinical trial [^1128yt3x]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

Baseline characteristics of the two study groups are shown in Table 1. There were no significant differences in age, sex distribution, smoking status, goiter size, serum concentrations of fT4, T3, TSH, TRAb, and daily MMI dosage at the time of study entry between those who continued versus stopped MMI treatment. Nonetheless, patients who continued MMI therapy had received MMI for a longer duration compared to those who discontinued MMI (15.6 ± 1.9 vs. 12.8 ± 4.0 years, respectively).

- **Table 1: Characteristics of two study groups at the start of the study**:
	- **A**: Goiter size: Grade 0, thyroid is not palpable or visible; Grade I, thyroid is easily palpable but not visible; Grade II, thyroid easily visible with the head in the normal position
	- **B**: Serum TRAb concentration was below 2.3 IU/L in all patients
	- **C**: Comorbidities included documented diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidemia

### Recurrent nocturnal hypoglycaemia as a cause of morning fatigue in treated Addison's disease — favourable response to dietary management: a case report [^117SFNty]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Addison's disease, or primary adrenal insufficiency, is often associated with reduced well-being and fatigue despite the use of currently recommended adrenal hormone replacement. Hypoglycaemia is a known manifestation of glucocorticoid deficiency, but it is generally considered rare in adults and not relevant to troubling ongoing symptoms in patients with Addison's disease.

- **Case presentation**: A 43-year-old woman with a three-year history of Addison's disease complained of severe morning fatigue and headaches despite standard glucocorticoid replacement therapy in the form of thrice-daily hydrocortisone and mineralocorticoid replacement with fludrocortisone. Alternative glucocorticoid replacement regimens and the addition of dehydroepiandrosterone replacement therapy had no effect. Nocturnal hypoglycaemia was suspected, and a 4-day continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) revealed hypoglycaemia (interstitial glucose < 2.2 mmol/L) between 0200–0400 h on 3 of 4 days. The patient was counselled to take an evening snack designed to ensure the slow absorption of ingested carbohydrates. Nocturnal hypoglycaemia was then absent on follow-up CGMS assessment. The patient noted a marked symptomatic improvement in morning symptoms, but with persistent fatigue during the day.

- **Conclusion**: Currently, the best strategy for control of non-specific symptoms in treated Addison's disease is unknown, but investigation for hypoglycaemia and treatment, where necessary, could assist some sufferers in achieving improved well-being.

### Methimazole [^113f16RM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Methimazole, USP (1-methylimidazole-2-thiol), is a white to pale buff crystalline powder that is freely soluble in water, alcohol, and chloroform, while slightly soluble in ether. It differs chemically from the drugs of the thiouracil series primarily because it has a 5-membered ring instead of a 6-membered ring.

Methimazole tablet, USP contains 5 mg or 10 mg (43.8 μmol or 87.6 μmol) of methimazole, USP, which is an orally administered antithyroid drug. Each tablet also contains corn starch, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, povidone K-30, and talc.

The molecular weight is 114.2 g/mol, and the molecular formula is C₄H₆N₂S.

### Control of Graves' hyperthyroidism with very long-term methimazole treatment: a clinical trial [^116FBcLA]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

Thyroid function status was defined as follows: Euthyroidism is characterized by TSH levels between 0.4 and 5.0 mU/L. Hypothyroidism is indicated by TSH levels greater than 5.0 mU/L, with fT4 levels either below 9 pmol/L or within the range of 9–23 pmol/L. Hyperthyroidism is defined as TSH levels lower than 0.4 mU/L, with fT4 levels greater than 23 pmol/L and/or T3 levels exceeding 200 ng/dL. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is identified by TSH levels less than 0.4 mU/L, with fT4 levels between 9 and 23 pmol/L and T3 levels between 80 and 200 ng/dL.

### Ten year outcome of anti-thyroid drug treatment for first episode Graves' thyrotoxicosis: The predictive importance of TRAb [^114zbzLH]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Measurement of TRAb is useful both as a diagnostic and prognostic tool and can help inform shared decision making regarding the optimal therapy choice in Graves' thyrotoxicosis. High TRAbs suggest a greater likelihood of recurrence, but an individual may value the opportunity to avoid long-term medication despite this; these data suggest that chance is approximately 50% in those who complete a course of ATD.

### The effect of methimazole pretreatment on the efficacy of radioactive iodine therapy in Graves' hyperthyroidism: One-year follow-up of a prospective, randomized study [^112HmKxP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

The effect of antithyroid drugs on the efficacy of radioiodine (131I) treatment is still controversial. This study evaluated the effect of methimazole pretreatment on the efficacy of 131I therapy in Graves' hyperthyroidism. Sixty-one untreated patients were randomly assigned to receive 131I alone (32 patients) or 131I plus pretreatment with methimazole (30 mg/d; 29 patients). 131I was administered 4 days after drug discontinuation. The calculated 131I dose was 200 microCi/g thyroid tissue as estimated by ultrasound, corrected by 24-hour radioiodine uptake. Serum TSH, T4, and free T4 were measured 4 days before 131I therapy, on the day of treatment, and then monthly for 1 year.

Approximately 80% of patients from both groups were cured 3 months after beginning 131I treatment, with cure defined as euthyroidism or hypothyroidism based on free T4 measurement. After 1 year, the groups were similar in terms of persistent hyperthyroidism (15.6% vs. 13.8%), euthyroidism (28.1% vs. 31.0%), or hypothyroidism (56.3% vs. 55.2%). Relapsed patients presented larger thyroid volume (P = 0.002), higher 24-hour radioiodine uptake (P = 0.022), and T3 levels (P = 0.002). Multiple logistic regression analysis identified T3 values as an independent predictor of therapy failure. In conclusion, pretreatment with methimazole had no effect on either the time required for cure or the 1-year success rate of 131I therapy.

### Prevalence of adrenal antibodies in Addison's disease among north Indian Caucasians [^116a3qnK]. Clinical Endocrinology (2003). Low credibility.

The prevalence of antibodies in different organ-specific autoimmune diseases can vary depending on the racial group studied. Data on the prevalence of antibodies against steroidogenic enzymes in Addison's disease is available only for white Caucasians. We have evaluated the frequency of antibodies against adrenal cytoplasm, 21-hydroxylase, 17-alpha-hydroxylase, and side-chain cleavage enzyme in a cohort of Indian patients with Addison's disease of idiopathic and granulomatous etiology.

- **Design**: Study of all patients with Addison's disease on whom serum samples were available (84% of total), presenting to the Endocrinology Department in a teaching hospital in India, between 1990 and 1999.

- **Patients**: Thirty-eight patients with Addison's disease (19 idiopathic, 19 granulomatous).

- **Methods**: A radiobinding assay using in vitro transcribed and translated recombinant human 35S-labelled 21-hydroxylase, 17-alpha-hydroxylase, and side-chain cleavage enzymes was utilized to detect the respective antibodies. Adrenal cytoplasmic antibodies were measured by indirect immunofluorescence on cryostatic sections of the human adrenal cortex.

- **Results**: Of the 19 patients with idiopathic Addison's disease, adrenal cytoplasmic antibodies were present in five (26%) patients, while 21-hydroxylase antibodies were present in four (21%) subjects. The frequency of 21-hydroxylase antibodies was similar among patients with isolated idiopathic Addison's disease (3/13, 23%) and those associated with other organ-specific autoimmune diseases (1/6, 17%).

### Association between thionamides and acute pancreatitis: A case-control study [^11777LRq]. Thyroid (2020). Low credibility.

This study demonstrates no significant association between the usage of thionamides (methimazole, carbimazole, and propylthiouracil) and the development of acute pancreatitis. However, previous studies have reported that acute pancreatitis was associated with methimazole or carbimazole use in nine patients. Propylthiouracil is the only thionamide without a case report suggesting an association with the development of acute pancreatitis.

As presented in the study, the onset of acute pancreatitis symptoms after methimazole or carbimazole exposure varied from 4 to 90 days. All symptoms and laboratory abnormalities resolved after the drug was withdrawn. The rate of acute pancreatitis after thionamide withdrawal was unknown; however, acute pancreatitis recurred in five of the five patients (four methimazole users and one carbimazole user) who were rechallenged with the original thionamide. The interval between rechallenge and the recurrence of acute pancreatitis ranged from 3 hours to 5 days.

However, none of the authors mentioned whether these five patients ever experienced acute pancreatitis previously, before ever being exposed to thionamides, or ultimately developed chronic pancreatitis. Some case reports did not exclude viral infections or autoimmune disease as a potential etiology of acute pancreatitis. Potassium iodide (one patient), propylthiouracil (two patients), and radioactive iodine (four patients) were administered for the management of hyperthyroidism after acute pancreatitis resolved.

### Addison's disease triggered by infection with mycobacterium abscessus, but not by adrenal tuberculosis or MAC pulmonary disease, in a subject with type 2 diabetes mellitus: case report [^115zbrdU]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Addison's disease is a primary adrenal dysfunction characterized by a marked decrease in cortisol levels accompanied by an increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels. Hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, and hypotension are often observed in subjects with Addison's disease. Pigmentation in the face and hands is sometimes observed, although the frequency is relatively low. It is thought that such pigmentation is brought about by the increment of ACTH and/or melanocyte-stimulating hormone through the cortisol deficiency-mediated feedback system.

It is known that infection is one of the main causes of Addison's disease. Among various infections, tuberculous infection accounts for the majority. In subjects with typical Addison's disease due to adrenal gland tuberculosis, swelling of both adrenal glands together with calcification is observed in some imaging examinations. Recently, the number of subjects with non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection has been increasing. It is known that the infection can also bring about Addison's disease, which has characteristics similar to those of adrenal gland tuberculosis. In Japan, mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) pulmonary disease after infection with mycobacterium avium or mycobacterium intracellulare accounts for the majority (more than 90%) of non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections.

Here we show a subject who had a non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection and Addison's disease triggered by the infection. Furthermore, while MAC pulmonary disease accounts for the majority of non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection cases, there are notable exceptions where different pathogens such as mycobacterium abscessus play a role.

### Prospective trial of functional thyrotropin receptor antibodies in Graves disease [^115c8kWq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Exclusion criteria included: age under 18 years, pregnancy within the past year, severe Graves' ophthalmopathy requiring medical immunosuppressive therapy, intake of drugs affecting the immune system, imminent or manifest thyrotoxic crisis, other severe diseases making protocol adherence unlikely, thyroid nodules requiring surgery, intolerance to both methimazole (MMI) and propylthiouracil (PTU), previous surgical or radioactive iodine therapy for Graves' disease, preference for an alternative therapy, unsuitability for this therapy as determined by the responsible physician, or undetectable TBII at the time of diagnosis.

Methimazole (MMI) was administered for 24 weeks, based on baseline serum concentrations of free triiodothyronine (T3) and free thyroxine (T4). The starting dose ranged from 5 to 30 mg per day. This dose was tapered or increased at each subsequent study visit, depending on whether the patient became euthyroid or remained hyperthyroid. The goals of therapy were to maintain normal free T4 and free T3 serum levels and serum TSH levels in the lower normal range. MMI therapy was stopped at week 24.

The main outcome measure was the clinical response versus nonresponse to the 24-week MMI treatment, defined as biochemical euthyroidism versus persistent hyperthyroidism at week 24, and further remission within the 72-week follow-up versus persistent hyperthyroidism at week 24 and/or relapse at weeks 36, 48, and 96. Safety was assessed based on treatment-emergent adverse events observed by caregivers or reported by patients spontaneously or after questioning.

### Addison's disease presenting in four adolescents with type 1 diabetes [^111gcWCT]. Pediatric Diabetes (2004). Low credibility.

Primary adrenocortical insufficiency, also known as Addison's disease, is a potentially fatal condition that often develops insidiously and can be easily overlooked. Although rare in the general population, it is more common among patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). The combination of Addison's disease with T1DM and/or autoimmune thyroid disease is known as autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type-2 (APS-2). T1DM commonly precedes the development of adrenocortical insufficiency in most patients with APS-2.

In this study, we present four cases of Addison's disease developing in adolescents with pre-existing T1DM. Risk factors for Addison's disease in this population include a history of other organ-specific autoimmunity, particularly thyroid disease, and a positive family history. In addition to the 'classic' Addisonian features, the development of unexplained hypoglycemia, reduction in total insulin requirement, improvement in glycemic control, or abnormal pigmentation should arouse suspicion of adrenocortical insufficiency.

Adrenal antibodies have been proposed as a screening tool for Addison's disease in the T1DM population, although doubts remain about their specificity and sensitivity. The addition of specific HLA DRB1 subtyping has been proposed to improve the predictive value of such screening.

### Concomitant methimazole-induced agranulocytosis and cholestatic jaundice in a young woman [^111cDs43]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

A woman in her 30s presented to the emergency department with a new-onset sore throat and fever. She had been diagnosed with Graves' disease 3 months prior and was initiated on atenolol and methimazole for management. Her methimazole dosing had been stable at 15mg daily for the month prior to presentation.

Investigation revealed severe neutropenia and jaundice. She was found to have concomitant agranulocytosis and cholestatic jaundice secondary to methimazole. Methimazole was discontinued on admission, and the patient received granulocyte colony-stimulating factor for an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of zero. She was placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics and intravenous steroids for epiglottic and supraglottic oedema noted on bedside laryngoscopy.

ANC and bilirubin levels improved over a 2-week hospital course. She was discharged on a temporary regimen of propranolol, dexamethasone, and potassium iodide until she could undergo successful thyroidectomy for definitive management of Graves' disease outpatient.

### Radioiodine therapy versus antithyroid medications for Graves' disease [^11121NKU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Graves' disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. Both antithyroid medications and radioiodine are commonly used treatments, but their frequency of use varies between regions and countries. Despite the prevalence of this diagnosis, any potential differences between the two treatments in terms of long-term outcomes remain unknown.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of radioiodine therapy versus antithyroid medications for Graves' disease.

- **Search methods**: We performed a systematic literature search in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, as well as the trial registers ICTRP Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. The date of the last search was September 2015 for all databases.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of radioiodine therapy versus antithyroid medications for Graves' disease with at least two years of follow-up were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts for relevance. One author carried out screening for inclusion, data extraction, and 'Risk of bias' assessment, and a second author checked this process. We presented data not suitable for meta-analysis as descriptive data. We analysed the overall quality of evidence using the GRADE instrument.

- **Main results**: We included two RCTs involving 425 adult participants with Graves' disease in this review. Altogether, 204 participants were randomised to radioiodine therapy and 221 to methimazole therapy. A single dose of radioiodine was administered, while methimazole medication was given for a duration of 18 months. The period of follow-up was…

### A challenging diagnosis that eventually results in a life-threatening condition: Addison's disease and adrenal crisis [^113iQ2km]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency and its deceiving appearance were originally described by Addison. Addison's compelling characterization still persists; the discolouration of the skin, faintness, loss of appetite, and extreme debility that the 'body wastes' and that 'the patient at length gradually sinks and expires' (figure 1). Nevertheless, over one and a half centuries later, we still struggle to recognize the clinical presentation and still fear the potentially fatal nature.

### Best practices in the laboratory diagnosis, prognostication, prediction, and monitoring of Graves' disease: Role of TRAbs [^113Dzykg]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). High credibility.

After 24 months of therapy with methimazole (MMI), 63.3% of patients with baseline TRAbs values of 10 IU/L were 39.4% and 21.5 months, respectively (p < 0.05 in both cases). The sensitivity and specificity for baseline TRAbs levels of 10 IU/L to predict remission were 57% and 74%, respectively. In another study, GD patients with a baseline TRAbs value ≥ 46.5 IU/L failed to achieve remission, with a sensitivity and specificity of 52% and 78%, respectively.

Higher baseline TRAbs levels were associated with a greater risk of GD relapse (HR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02–1.08, p = 0.001) independent of age, sex, race, smoking status, and TPOAb levels. This association was more apparent among younger patients (18–41 years, HR 1.13, 95% CI 1.04–1.23, p = 0.005; 42–56 years, HR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01–1.09, p = 0.01) but was not significant in patients aged ≥ 57 years (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.93–1.05, p = 0.7).

Higher baseline TRAbs levels were also associated with poorer prognosis after 12–18 months of therapy, irrespective of whether the patients received antithyroid drugs, radioiodine therapy, or surgical therapy.

### More, less or both [^1115i2GQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

This case discusses the simultaneous presentation of Addison's disease and Graves' thyrotoxicosis. An artistic impression of Dr. Thomas Addison and Dr. Robert James Graves is depicted in Figure 1.

Clustering of autoimmune endocrine diseases is well known, as demonstrated in Whitaker and Schmidt syndrome, also known as polyglandular syndrome type I and II. The combination of hypothyroidism and Addison's disease often presents as part of polyglandular syndrome type I. However, the combination of Graves' and Addison's disease, as seen in our patient, is extremely rare.

To the best of our knowledge, only three cases in the literature describe the simultaneous presentation of Addison's disease and Graves' thyrotoxicosis. The clinical presentation was highly variable across these cases. One case presented with a vasovagal episode and extensive vitiligo. Another case exhibited general weakness and skin pigmentation that had begun several months before. In both instances, the diagnosis of Addison's disease was made prior to diagnosing thyrotoxicosis. In a third case report, the patient presented with headache, paresthesia, heat intolerance, general weakness, and vomiting. The diagnosis of Graves' disease was confirmed before diagnosing an Addisonian crisis.

One may speculate that the simultaneous presentation in our patient could be explained by the thyrotoxicosis unmasking a latent Addison's disease, as thyroid hormone can increase the metabolism of cortisol.

Some clues in our case deserve special mention. First, we were puzzled…

### Natural history of adrenal steroidogenesis in autoimmune Addison's disease following diagnosis and treatment [^111JNM3m]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Autoimmune Addison's disease (AAD) is a rare endocrinopathy characterized by immune-mediated destruction of the adrenal cortex. Without treatment, it is invariably fatal, but once diagnosed, health can be maintained with daily glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement tablets. Symptoms of AAD frequently start months or years before the condition is diagnosed, and it is thought that it progresses to a "point of no return", where complete adrenocortical steroidogenic failure is inevitable and universal. Despite this assumption, several cases showing apparent spontaneous remission of well-characterized AAD have been reported in patients several years after an initial firm diagnosis.

In addition, one study reported a reduction in adrenal autoantibody titer and improved adrenal function in a presymptomatic individual following high-dose prednisolone therapy for coexisting Graves' orbitopathy. These studies suggest that adrenocortical steroidogenesis may exhibit some plasticity both at the initial presentation of Addison's disease and perhaps persisting postdiagnosis and treatment of AAD. With this in mind, we previously studied 13 patients with established AAD and found that 2 (15%) had detectable steroidogenesis 4 and 8 years postdiagnosis, which was amenable to improvement with high-dose ACTH therapy. One of these individuals remains healthy without steroid medication more than 7 years later, although ACTH remains elevated and adrenal autoantibodies remain detectable.

### Sexual dysfunctions in men affected by autoimmune Addison's disease before and after short-term gluco- and mineralocorticoid replacement therapy [^111gZZm6]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

There is evidence suggesting that autoimmune Addison's disease (AD) could be associated with sexual dysfunctions, probably caused by gluco- and mineralocorticoid deficiency; however, no study has yet treated this subject in males.

- **Aim**: To evaluate male sexuality and psychological correlates in autoimmune AD before and after gluco- and mineralocorticoid replacement therapy.

- **Methods**: Twelve subjects with a first diagnosis of autoimmune AD were studied before (baseline) and 2 months after (recovery phase) initiating hormone replacement therapy.

- **Main outcome measures**: Erectile function (EF), orgasmic function (OF), sexual desire (SD), intercourse satisfaction (IS), overall satisfaction (OS), depression, and anxiety were studied using a number of questionnaires (International Index of Erectile Function, Beck Depression Inventory, and Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory); clinical, biochemical, and hormone data were included in the analysis.

- **Results**: At baseline, low values were found for EF, OF, SD, IS, and OS, and high values for depression and anxiety; all of these parameters improved significantly in the recovery phase compared with baseline. EF variation between the two phases correlated significantly and positively with the variation of serum cortisol, urinary free cortisol, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure and inversely with that of upright plasma renin activity. Multiple linear regression analysis using EF variation as the dependent variable confirmed the relationship of the latter with variations of serum cortisol, urinary free cortisol, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and upright plasma renin activity.

### Association between thionamides and acute pancreatitis: A case-control study [^1117TvnC]. Thyroid (2020). Low credibility.

Thionamides have been used to treat patients with hyperthyroidism for many years. On January 4, 2019, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee of the European Medicines Agency published a recommendation regarding the safety signals of carbimazole and methimazole. The committee recommended that carbimazole or methimazole should be discontinued immediately if patients develop acute pancreatitis during treatment, and that for patients with a history of acute pancreatitis, clinicians should avoid re-exposing patients to carbimazole or methimazole following a previous administration of one of these drugs. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency of the United Kingdom followed these recommendations and published the same safety signal on February 18, 2019. However, the associated risk remains clinically unclear.

The aim of this retrospective case-control study was to evaluate the associations of thionamides in general, and carbimazole, methimazole, and propylthiouracil in particular, with acute pancreatitis using Taiwan's Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000 (LHID2000). This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of China Medical University and Hospital (CMUH-104-REC2–115-R3).

### Treating the side effects of exogenous glucocorticoids; can we separate the good from the bad [^111vpgBK]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

Additional data from patients taking glucocorticoid (GC) replacement therapy have enhanced our understanding of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP). Patients with Addison's disease treated with high-dose replacement therapy experience a time-dependent reduction in bone mineral density (BMD) at both the spine and the hip. Importantly, recent evidence suggests that patients with Addison's disease, or other causes of adrenal insufficiency treated with lower GC replacement doses, do not exhibit a reduction in BMD. However, data are not universally consistent, as a higher prevalence of vertebral fractures (30% vs. 13%) has been documented in patients with Addison's disease, despite no observed differences in BMD.

Reducing the GC replacement dose effectively increases spine and hip Z-scores, but the impact on fracture risk has yet to be examined. Caution is advised when interpreting data from patients with adrenal insufficiency due to the potential additive negative effects of adrenal androgen deficiency, as seen in Addison's disease, and the likelihood of coexisting hormonal deficiencies, such as in patients with hypopituitarism. Similarly, patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) present heterogeneous cohorts, where the contribution of androgen excess alongside the impact of GC therapy must be considered. Overall, BMD appears to be reduced at all skeletal sites in CAH, and, akin to patients with Addison's disease, this reduction correlates with cumulative GC exposure in some studies but not in all.

### Ten year outcome of anti-thyroid drug treatment for first episode Graves' thyrotoxicosis: The predictive importance of TRAb [^113mQinq]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Baseline characteristics**: Of 290 people with baseline TRAb data available, 191 had completed 10-year follow-up and their outcomes are reported. Reasons for non-inclusion are reported in Figure 1. There were no differences of note, in terms of demographics or presenting biochemistry, between those with 10-year follow-up data and those not included in the final analysis. Eighty percent of patients were female. At the completion of ATD therapy, 175 out of 191 (92%) were on carbimazole and 16 out of 191 (8%) were on PTU. The median duration of ATD therapy was 17 months (16–19).

- **Relapse and outcomes**: ReThyrotoxicosis occurred in 103 out of 191 people within 10 years (54%). Fifty-four percent of all relapses (56 out of 103) occurred within 1 year, 72% within 2 years (74 out of 103), and 93% within 5 years (96 out of 103). Using the final relapse status of those excluded from the main analysis (due to death or loss to follow-up), the recurrence rate was broadly similar at 51% (139 out of 272). The median follow-up duration was 141 months (128–160) and the status of all individuals is reported in Table 2. Only a single further case of reThyrotoxicosis was observed during extended follow-up. There was no significant difference in the likelihood of not being on therapy at the final follow-up (ATD or thyroid hormone replacement) based on TRAb category at diagnosis (high: 46%, medium: 53%, low: 54%, p = 0.660).

### Screening for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy among adult men with Addison's disease [^117XWR5u]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is an important cause of Addison's disease in boys, but less is known about its contribution to Addison's disease in adult men. After surveying all known cases of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy in Norway in a separate study, we aimed to look for any missed cases among the population of adult men with nonautoimmune Addison's disease.

- **Study design**: Among 153 adult men identified in a National Registry for Addison's Disease (75% of identified male cases of Addison's disease in Norway), those with negative indices for 21-hydroxylase autoantibodies were selected. Additionally, cases with low autoantibody indices (48–200) were selected. Sera from subjects included were analyzed for levels of very long-chain fatty acids, which are diagnostic for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy in men.

- **Results**: Eighteen subjects had negative indices and 17 had low indices for 21-hydroxylase autoantibodies. None of those with low indices and only one of those with negative indices were found to have X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy; this subject had already been diagnosed because of the neurological symptoms. Cases of Addison's disease proved to be caused by X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy constitute 1.5% of all adult male cases in Norway; the proportion among nonautoimmune cases was 15%.

- **Conclusions**: We found X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy to be an uncommon cause of Addison's disease in adult men. However, this etiological diagnosis has far-reaching consequences both for the patient and for his extended family. We therefore recommend that all adult men with nonautoimmune Addison's disease be screened for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy.

### Long-term methimazole therapy in juvenile Graves' disease: A randomized trial [^113EqiJq]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Recent studies show that long-term (LT) antithyroid drugs reduce relapse of hyperthyroidism in patients with Graves' disease. Our objective was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of LT methimazole treatment and to compare remission rates in Graves' disease patients after LT and short-term (ST) therapy.

- **Methods**: In this randomized, parallel group trial, 66 consecutive patients with untreated juvenile Graves' hyperthyroidism were enrolled. After a median 22 months of methimazole treatment, 56 patients were randomly assigned to either continue low-dose methimazole treatment (n = 24, LT group) or to discontinue treatment (n = 24, ST group). Twenty-four patients in the LT group completed 96 to 120 months of methimazole treatment. Patients in both groups were managed for 48 months after discontinuation of treatment.

- **Results**: Except for 3 cases of cutaneous reactions, no other adverse events were observed throughout 120 months of methimazole therapy. Serum free thyroxine, triiodothyronine, thyrotropin, and thyrotropin receptor antibody remained normal, and the required daily dosage of methimazole was gradually decreased from 5.17 ± 1.05 mg at 22 months to 3.5 ± 1.3 mg between 96 and 120 months of treatment (P < .001). Hyperthyroidism was cured in 92% and 88% of LT patients and in 46% and 33% of ST patients, 1 and 4 years after methimazole withdrawal, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: LT methimazole treatment of 96 to 120 months is safe and effective for the treatment of juvenile Graves' disease. The four-year cure rate of hyperthyroidism with LT methimazole remains significant.

### Control of Graves' hyperthyroidism with very long-term methimazole treatment: a clinical trial [^1139EHZr]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

Serum concentrations of TSH and TSH receptor antibody (TRAb), along with mean daily doses of methimazole, were tracked during 24 years of continuous treatment. All 27 patients remained on therapy for at least 15 years, with 16 patients continuing until 20 years and 11 patients until 24 years. Daily doses of methimazole required to maintain euthyroidism decreased to a mean of 3.4 ± 1.0 mg by 15 years and 2.8 ± 1.7 mg by 24 years. Suppressed serum TSH levels were not observed in any patient after 7 years of treatment. Serum TRAb levels normalized in all patients during methimazole treatment.

- **Serum hormone concentrations**: Mean ± standard deviation values showed normal distribution. Serum levels of TSH and TRAb were within the normal range after 6 years of treatment, indicating effective management of symptoms.

Free thyroxine (fT4), triiodothyronine (T3), and thyrotropin (TSH) levels reflected successful long-term methimazole (MMI) treatment. Mean methimazole dosage was 9.8 ± 1.0 mg daily after three months and reduced to 5.4 ± 1.6 mg by the end of the first year. By 10 years, daily doses were lowered to ≤ 5 mg in all patients, with a further decrease to 2.8 ± 1.7 mg by 24 years. Notably, 5 of 11 patients required only ≤ 2.5 mg daily to maintain euthyroidism. None of the subjects experienced a recurrence on therapy. Minor skin reactions were observed in six patients within the initial months, whereas severe reactions like agranulocytosis and liver dysfunction were not reported.

### Methimazole [^112x2T5V]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Methimazole can cause hypothyroidism, necessitating routine monitoring of TSH and free T4 levels with adjustments in dosing to maintain a euthyroid state. Because the drug readily crosses placental membranes, methimazole can cause fetal goiter and cretinism when administered to a pregnant woman. For this reason, it is important that a sufficient, but not excessive, dose be given during pregnancy (see PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy).

- **Vasculitis**: Cases of vasculitis resulting in severe complications have been reported in patients receiving methimazole therapy. These cases include leukocytoclastic cutaneous vasculitis, acute kidney injury and glomerulonephritis, alveolar/pulmonary hemorrhage, CNS vasculitis, and neuropathy. Most cases were associated with anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)-positive vasculitis. In some cases, vasculitis resolved or improved with drug discontinuation; however, more severe cases required treatment with additional measures, including corticosteroids, immunosuppressant therapy, and plasmapheresis. If vasculitis is suspected, discontinue therapy and initiate appropriate intervention.

### Serum thyrotropin receptor antibodies concentrations in patients with Graves' disease before, at the end of methimazole treatment, and after drug withdrawal: Evidence that the activity of thyrotropin receptor antibody and/or thyroid response modify during the observation period [^111ox53T]. Thyroid (2006). Low credibility.

We performed a quantitative retrospective analysis of serum thyrotropin receptor antibody (TRAb) concentrations measured by a second-generation radioreceptor assay in 58 patients with Graves' disease (GD) at the onset of the disease, at the end of 18-month methimazole (MMI) treatment, and after MMI withdrawal to evaluate the correlation between the presence of these antibodies and the relapse of hyperthyroidism. Sixty healthy subjects were enrolled as a control group.

- **Results**: Before MMI treatment, the best cutoff TRAb value for identifying patients with GD was 1.45 UI/L (specificity, 100%; sensitivity, 98.3%). At the end of MMI treatment, serum TRAb concentrations were significantly lower (p < 1.45 UI/L). After MMI withdrawal (median, 15 months), 34 patients (58.6%) became hyperthyroid, 4 patients (6.9%) became hypothyroid, and 20 patients (34.5%) remained euthyroid. There was a significant correlation between serum TRAb concentrations at the end of MMI treatment and the percentage of patients who became hyperthyroid (r: 0.56; p < 0.001) and the time of appearance of hyperthyroidism (r: -0.38; p = 0.03). All 4 patients with TRAb values below 0.9 UI/L at the end of MMI treatment remained euthyroid throughout the follow-up period. Among the 27 patients who had serum TRAb values higher than 4.4 UI/L, 23 developed hyperthyroidism and 4 hypothyroidism.

### Hyperthyroidism (primary) [^113fcbvn]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Low credibility.

Hyperthyroidism is characterized by high levels of serum thyroxine and triiodothyronine, and low levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone. The main causes of hyperthyroidism are Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goitre, and toxic adenoma. About 20 times more women than men have hyperthyroidism.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of drug treatments for primary hyperthyroidism? What are the effects of surgical treatments for primary hyperthyroidism? What are the effects of treatments for subclinical hyperthyroidism? We searched Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to February 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 15 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: adding thyroxine to antithyroid drugs (carbimazole, propylthiouracil, and thiamazole), antithyroid drugs (carbimazole, propylthiouracil, and thiamazole), radioactive iodine, and thyroidectomy.

### Addison's disease presenting as male infertility [^114cPoRu]. Fertility and Sterility (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this case report is to present a case of primary male infertility with severe oligospermia and hyperpigmented skin as the main presenting clinical signs. Conducted in a university-affiliated teaching hospital, the study involved a 32-year-old male with severe oligospermia and his 31-year-old female partner with normal cycles.

The interventions included the administration of hydrocortisone, fludrocortisone, methimazole, and eventual IVF.

- **Main outcome measures**: Improved semen analysis, correction of Addison's disease, correction of hyperthyroidism, and achieving ART pregnancy.

Results indicated severe oligospermia of 5 million per milliliter with 15% motility, and an ACTH level of 2,800 pg/mL upon presentation. Endocrinology evaluation revealed a cortisol level of < 0.1 microg/dL, and the Cortrosyn test showed no response, confirming Addison's disease. The patient was also found to have a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of < 0.1 microIU/mL, T4 of 9.5 microg/dL, Free T4 Index calculation of 11.6 microg/dL, and quantitative triiodothyronine of 273 ng/dL at presentation. His Addison's disease was managed with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone, and his hyperthyroidism with methimazole. Semen parameters increased to 34 million per milliliter with 45% motility and 5% Kruger morphology one year after the initial presentation. Hormone parameters normalized. Rather than waiting for more time for natural conception or IUI, the couple opted for IVF due to insurance coverage before semen parameters normalized.

This report concludes as the first known case of Addison's disease presenting as male infertility with hyperpigmentation.

### More, less or both [^115gdivR]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Our case demonstrates the rare simultaneous presentation of Graves' thyrotoxicosis and Addison's disease. Possible clues for Addison's disease, such as hyperkalemia, may be masked by the concomitant thyrotoxicosis. This case shows the importance of always keeping the possibility of another autoimmune endocrine disorder in mind. It also provides several suggestions that can help the clinician in recognizing the simultaneous presentation of thyrotoxicosis and Addison's disease.

- **Patient's perspective**: When I was admitted to the hospital, I realized that something was seriously wrong. I had been sick before, but never like this. I couldn't even walk properly anymore!

	- During my stay at the hospital, I felt somewhat delirious at first. I could not completely process what was going on but remembered that the doctors took a lot of blood for tests. I gave in to the circumstances and was hoping that they could find something in my blood to treat and hopefully cure.

	- When I got admitted to the medium care unit, I realized that it might be more serious than I thought at first. I was never in fear of dying but had complete faith in the hospital and its staff. I recovered shortly after my stay at the medium care and left the hospital in good health.

	- After my admission to the hospital, I contacted my general practitioner. She was shocked that I was diagnosed with Addison's disease and a fast-working thyroid gland. I had visited her multiple times prior to my travels and hospitalization with complaints of fatigue and generalized weakness. In hindsight, I think she might have missed my co

### Metopirone [^116xHAND]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Warnings and precautions for Metopirone include the following:

- **Adrenal insufficiency**: Metopirone may induce acute adrenal insufficiency. It is recommended that the ability of the adrenals to respond to exogenous ACTH be demonstrated before employing Metopirone as a test. Metopirone may induce adrenal insufficiency in patients with reduced adrenal secretory capacity or global pituitary insufficiency. The test should be performed in a hospital with close monitoring if adrenal insufficiency is suspected. In cases of hypo- or hyperthyroidism, the response to the Metopirone test may be subnormal. If adrenocortical or anterior pituitary function is more severely compromised than indicated by the test results, Metopirone may trigger adrenal insufficiency. This can be corrected with appropriate doses of corticosteroids.

- **Dizziness and sedation**: Metopirone may cause dizziness and sedation. Patients should not drive or operate machinery until these effects have passed.

### Response to letter to the editor from Sukor et al.: "Evaluation and treatment of amiodarone-induced thyroid disorders" [^113MvhAG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

We welcome the interest indicated by Dr. Sukor and colleagues in our recent publication and address their several concerns below.

Their first concern regards our not mentioning the patient's heart rate in the discussion section. While we acknowledge the common relationship of heart rate as a reflection of thyroid status, adjunctive therapy with beta-blockers, as was employed in our patient, often will mask the chronotropic effect of the thyroid hormones. The patient described had frequent ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation episodes requiring beta-adrenergic blocker therapy, thereby rendering his heart rate not to be a reliable reflection of his thyroid status.

Further, the authors interpret our discussion of the patient's follow-up to indicate advocacy solely for the utility of measurements of free T3/total T3, whereas these remarks were made in the context of reference to the work of Bartalena et al. On the contrary, the value of the FT4 assay, alone or together with FT3, clearly is mentioned for both the patient's diagnosis and follow-up and was performed in his case. We do agree with the authors that FT3 can be normal in AIT as it was in our patient.

Finally, the authors' remarks regarding our management with methimazole and prednisone relate to the classification of the patient's AIT as a mixed Type 1/Type 2 instead of Type 1. Although our patient presented with characteristics that pointed more to Type 2 AIT, at present there is no definitive method to specifically distinguish between Type 1 and Type 2 AIT. Consequently, and particularly when a mixed Type 1/Type 2 AIT was considered…

### More, less or both [^116Y3W1q]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Second, the low serum creatinine drew our attention, especially in the presence of hypovolemia and a normal muscle mass. An explanation for this might be long-standing Addison's disease, which can decrease muscle mass due to myopathy. However, thyrotoxicosis itself is associated with a low serum creatinine due to an increase in GFR and decrease in muscle mass. Since urea nitrogen is usually elevated in thyrotoxicosis, a raised urea/creatinine ratio, as was seen in our patient, may point to this diagnosis.

Third, the lack of hyperpigmentation was also surprising, but several recent studies show that this is not always present in Addison's disease. The clues in our patient for Addison's disease were weakness, fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms, hypotension, low sodium, low cortisol, low aldosterone, and positive adrenal antibodies. These clues are highly specific for Addison's disease.

Finally, we did not perform an ACTH test before starting treatment with hydrocortisone. We had no reasonable doubts regarding the diagnosis, since we did measure hypocortisolism, hypoaldosteronism, and positive adrenal antibodies in a state of hypovolemia, confirming the diagnosis of an 'adrenal hypocortisolism'. It was not possible to measure ACTH as we had already started treatment. However, we do recommend always including an ACTH measurement prior to starting treatment with hydrocortisone, as this gives more strength to the diagnosis by ruling out a possible coexisting pituitary failure. Furthermore, measurement of ACTH is also important in the follow-up of Addison's disease.

For this study, all 59 patients who had been on long-term methimazole (LT-MMI) treatment for 14.2 ± 2.9 years were recruited. The principal investigator (F. A.) explained the advantages and disadvantages of methimazole (MMI) withdrawal versus MMI continuation for additional years, making an effort not to influence patient choice. Patients were given the option to either discontinue MMI treatment or continue LT-MMI therapy.

- **Patient choice**: Thirty-two patients (54%) decided to discontinue MMI, while 27 (46%) preferred continuous LT-MMI treatment.

All patients were followed every six months, as previously described.

### Natural history of adrenal steroidogenesis in autoimmune Addison's disease following diagnosis and treatment [^114EsCsZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

The natural history of adrenal function in autoimmune Addison disease once diagnosed and treated has not been systematically studied, but several case reports of recovery from established adrenal failure suggest it may not be uniform.

- **Objective**: To ascertain steroidogenic function in autoimmune Addison disease immediately following diagnosis and during prolonged treatment.

- **Design**: We studied peak serum cortisol in response to ACTH1–24 in 20 newly diagnosed autoimmune Addison disease patients at first presentation and then again within a month. We also studied 37 patients with established Addison disease (for between 7 months and 44 years) in a medication-free state, measuring peak serum cortisol responses to ACTH1–24 and the urine LC-MS steroid metabolome.

- **Results**: Adrenal steroidogenesis declined rapidly after steroid replacement treatment for newly diagnosed Addison disease was started, with a peak serum cortisol falling from 138 ± 19 nmol/L (SEM) at presentation to 63 ± 13 nmol/L over 4 weeks (P < 0.003). Six of 37 participants (16%) with established Addison disease had detectable serum cortisol and urine glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid metabolites during repeat testing, indicating variable degrees of residual adrenal function.

- **Conclusion**: Autoimmune Addison disease is a heterogeneous condition, showing a rapid decline in adrenal steroidogenesis during the first few weeks following diagnosis, but low-level residual function in a minority of patients, which appears to persist for many years.

### Control of Graves' hyperthyroidism with very long-term methimazole treatment: A clinical trial [^116rDFk9]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

Long-term antithyroid drug therapy has become one of the options for treatment of Graves' hyperthyroidism. The aim of this study was to compare thyroid status in those who discontinued methimazole (MMI) treatment after 12.8 years with those who continued MMI as long as 24 years.

- **Methods**: Fifty-nine patients with Graves' disease on long-term MMI for 14.2 ± 2.9 years were recruited; 32 patients (54%) decided to discontinue MMI, and 27 (46%) preferred additional years of MMI treatment. All patients were followed for a mean of 6 additional years.

- **Results**: Of 27 patients who continued MMI up to 24 years, suppressed serum thyrotropin (TSH) was not observed in any patient after the seventh year of treatment. Serum free thyroxine, triiodothyronine, TSH, and TSH receptor antibody concentrations remained normal throughout the study. The mean daily dose of MMI to maintain TSH in the reference range gradually decreased, reaching 2.8 ± 1.7 mg by 24 years of MMI treatment. No adverse reactions related to MMI occurred during the additional years of therapy. In 32 patients who discontinued MMI, hyperthyroidism relapsed in 6 patients (19%), one left follow-up, and 25 (78%) remained euthyroid during the study.

- **Conclusions**: Long-term low-dose MMI treatment may be a lifelong effective and safe therapeutic modality in patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism for the prevention of relapse, if studies from other centers confirm the findings of this research.

### Ten year outcome of anti-thyroid drug treatment for first episode Graves' thyrotoxicosis: The predictive importance of TRAb [^114GLmxm]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Low credibility.

In the United Kingdom, 2019 NICE guidelines suggest radioactive iodine is offered as first-line definitive therapy, but anti-thyroid drugs (ATDs) should be considered where remission is likely to be achieved. However, despite associations between several clinical and demographic factors, it remains extremely difficult, at an individual patient level, to adequately define the risk of recurrence. Furthermore, as our data suggest, more than half of those who complete an ATD course will not require any thyroid-related therapy at long-term follow-up, and this is an outcome which is highly valued by patients.

Although definitive when successful, radioiodine has an appreciable failure rate, and this appears to be greatest in those with the highest TRAb levels at diagnosis (precisely the group where early radioiodine may be favored). Published data on outcomes with long-term carbimazole are limited, but this approach has been reported to achieve similar thyroid function results, in the context of a virtual thyrotoxicosis clinic, when compared to definitive therapies. An observational study in Italy suggested lower rates of recurrence with persistent ATD therapy, although this effect appeared limited to those over the age of 35 years.

The potential efficacy of longer-term ATD therapy, and the observation that those with the highest TRAb concentration will typically relapse within 2 years, suggests an approach of continuing ATD until TRAb is undetectable (or perhaps up to 5 years when recurrence rates drop substantially); although this would require confirmation in a randomized controlled trial.

### Methimazole [^115Eayrr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Methimazole inhibits the synthesis of thyroid hormones, making it an effective treatment for hyperthyroidism. The drug does not inactivate existing thyroxine and triiodothyronine stored in the thyroid or circulating in the blood, nor does it interfere with the effectiveness of thyroid hormones administered orally or by injection.

Methimazole is readily absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, metabolized in the liver, and excreted in the urine.

### Methimazole [^11329dYA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Patients who receive methimazole should be under close surveillance and cautioned to report immediately any evidence of illness, particularly sore throat, skin eruptions, fever, headache, or general malaise. In such cases, white-blood-cell and differential counts should be obtained to determine whether agranulocytosis has developed. Particular care should be exercised with patients who are receiving additional drugs known to cause agranulocytosis.

- **Information for patients**: Patients should be advised that if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant while taking an antithyroid drug, they should contact their physician immediately about their therapy. Inform patients that cases of vasculitis resulting in severe complications have occurred with methimazole tablets. Patients should promptly report symptoms that may be associated with vasculitis, including new rash, hematuria or decreased urine output, dyspnea, or hemoptysis [see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS].

- **Laboratory tests**: Because methimazole may cause hypoprothrombinemia and bleeding, prothrombin time should be monitored during therapy, especially before surgical procedures. Thyroid function tests should be monitored periodically. Once clinical evidence of hyperthyroidism has resolved, the finding of a rising serum TSH indicates that a lower maintenance dose of methimazole tablets should be employed.

- **Drug interactions**: Anticoagulants (oral): Due to potential inhibition of vitamin K activity by methimazole, the activity of oral anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin) may be affected.
