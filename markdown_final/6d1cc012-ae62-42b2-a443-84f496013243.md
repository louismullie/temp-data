## Question

Binge eating disorder treatment options

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment options for binge eating disorder. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about establishing the disorder context and first-line principles. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for psychotherapies versus pharmacotherapy. Next, I will examine specific psychotherapy modalities and formats, followed by pharmacologic options and their limitations. After that, I need to consider special populations and settings, including youth and severe presentations. Finally, I will integrate comorbidity, weight management, and implementation considerations, and close with a practical, stepped-care algorithm and key takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the disorder context and foundational treatment principles. Binge eating disorder is the most common eating disorder, characterized by recurrent binge episodes with loss of control and marked distress, frequently co-occurring with obesity and psychiatric comorbidity; importantly, BED is a psychiatric disorder whose primary treatment target is reduction of binge frequency and related psychopathology, not weight loss per se [^116t15E5] [^111AMQZu]. I should confirm that psychotherapy is first-line and that multidisciplinary, person-centered care is recommended, which the APA 2023 guideline explicitly endorses, alongside AACAP's emphasis on coordinated team-based care for youth [^115fXxoy] [^112vKMyB] [^112NHjAN].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about medications; I need to check the comparative evidence. Multiple high-quality sources converge on psychotherapy as first-line, with CBT and IPT demonstrating the most robust and durable effects on binge abstinence and eating disorder psychopathology, whereas pharmacotherapy is generally reserved for nonresponders or patient preference, and weight-focused anti-obesity agents do not treat the core psychopathology of BED [^115fXxoy] [^113fnsZS] [^111AMQZu]. Wait, let me verify the durability claim: meta-analytic data show sustained abstinence rates after psychological treatment, supporting the long-term efficacy of psychotherapy, whereas medication-only effects are less durable and often modest beyond short-term trials [^1128pRBQ] [^117GJgh2].

> I will now examine specific psychotherapy modalities, starting with CBT. CBT, including CBT-E, reliably reduces binge frequency and improves eating disorder psychopathology across formats, with moderate-to-large effects versus inactive controls and comparable outcomes to other active psychotherapies; importantly, CBT does not reliably produce clinically significant weight loss, which aligns with the disorder's psychiatric targets rather than metabolic endpoints [^115fXxoy] [^113WVe6t] [^113fnsZS]. Let me consider IPT next: IPT achieves high abstinence rates and may be particularly suitable for patients with high eating disorder psychopathology, negative affect, or interpersonal difficulties, and in some longitudinal work has shown durable superiority over behavioral weight loss and guided self-help in high-negative-affect subgroups [^113fnsZS] [^111xDJqv]. DBT-based adaptations show promise for emotion regulation deficits but require more definitive long-term data before being considered first-line broadly, though they remain reasonable for selected patients with prominent affective dysregulation [^111xDJqv] [^112zZU7H].

> Next, I should review treatment formats and access. Guided self-help CBT (CBTgsh) is effective and can be noninferior to treatment-as-usual CBT in adults, supporting its role as a scalable first step in stepped care; unguided self-help is less consistent and generally inferior to guided formats, reinforcing the value of at least minimal therapeutic support [^114JiWLp] [^115KgbBy]. Wait, I should double-check the role of behavioral weight loss: BWL can reduce binge eating and weight in the short term but is less effective than CBT or IPT for eliminating binge eating long term, so BWL may be reasonable when weight reduction is a priority and eating disorder psychopathology is low, ideally integrated with psychological treatment rather than used alone [^113fnsZS] [^112hH7LG].

> Now, pharmacotherapy. I need to ensure I anchor on the only FDA-approved agent. Lisdexamfetamine is the only medication with regulatory approval for BED, with robust effects on binge frequency and remission in adults, but benefits are largely limited to core binge symptoms and do not extend to meaningful weight loss; stimulant-related risks, cardiovascular considerations, and psychiatric adverse effects, including potential mood worsening, warrant careful screening and monitoring, and use should be reserved for adults preferring medication or not responding to psychotherapy [^1116ymnD] [^111AMQZu] [^116mrMKq]. Hold on, I should verify off-label options: topiramate has evidence for reducing binge frequency and modest weight effects but is limited by cognitive and paresthesia adverse effects; SSRIs have inconsistent effects on binge eating and are better reserved for comorbid mood or anxiety rather than primary BED symptoms; naltrexone/bupropion failed to outperform placebo for binge outcomes despite weight loss, underscoring the disconnect between weight reduction and binge psychopathology [^116mrMKq] [^114rnVvh] [^111AMQZu].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with youth. Evidence for pediatric BED is limited; AACAP recommends outpatient psychosocial interventions as first-line, with medications reserved for comorbidities or refractory cases, and care delivered within a developmentally informed multidisciplinary team; given the paucity of pediatric RCTs, adult protocols are sometimes adapted with caution, and family involvement is often essential [^1153YSf3] [^115SZHbW] [^115ERLcn] [^116HyPBo] [^112NHjAN]. I should confirm that screening and comprehensive evaluation are advised in pediatric settings, which AACAP emphasizes to improve early detection and appropriate referral [^1127c53i].

> Next, I should review settings of care and escalation criteria. Outpatient treatment is appropriate for most patients, with stepped intensification to partial hospitalization or residential care when outpatient interventions fail, when medical or psychiatric risk is high, or when structure is needed to ensure safety and engagement; APA and AACAP both endorse matching intensity to severity and risk, with inpatient care reserved for acute medical instability or high suicidality [^116HyPBo] [^114ATnzc]. Wait, let me verify the role of technology: virtual CBT-based programs and guided self-help can expand access, but high-risk patients still require in-person medical and psychiatric evaluation, and equity considerations are critical to avoid widening disparities in care [^1175bW5Z] [^115nnbSq].

> I need to ensure comorbidity and weight management are addressed thoughtfully. BED frequently co-occurs with mood, anxiety, ADHD, and substance use disorders; treating comorbidities can improve adherence and global functioning, but medications should be chosen to avoid exacerbating binge behaviors or weight gain, and coordination across psychiatric and medical providers is essential [^116t15E5] [^112vKMyB]. But wait, what if weight loss is a patient priority? I should confirm that weight-focused interventions can proceed in parallel with BED treatment, yet sustained weight loss is modest at best with current approaches, and anti-obesity drugs do not treat binge psychopathology; therefore, weight goals should be framed within a weight-neutral, health-focused philosophy to minimize iatrogenic effects and weight stigma, which itself can impede engagement and outcomes [^113fnsZS] [^111AMQZu] [^114noTFx].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepped-care algorithm, and I will double-check each step against guidelines. Start with psychoeducation and screening for comorbidities, then initiate CBT or IPT in individual or group formats; if access is limited, begin with guided self-help CBT and escalate to therapist-led care if response is inadequate; for partial responders or those preferring medication, consider lisdexamfetamine with informed consent and monitoring; for nonresponders to first-line approaches, consider switching modality, adding IPT if not already used, or integrating DBT skills for emotion regulation; throughout, embed multidisciplinary medical and nutritional support, and adjust setting of care to severity and risk, escalating to PHP or residential when indicated [^115fXxoy] [^113fnsZS] [^1116ymnD] [^112vKMyB]. Hold on, I should verify the role of early response: rapid improvement within the first month of psychotherapy predicts better outcomes, which can guide timely adjustments and expectations in shared decision-making [^1171GX8p].

> Finally, I should confirm the key takeaways and correct any overstatements. Psychotherapy, particularly CBT and IPT, remains first-line and yields clinically meaningful abstinence rates on the order of roughly 45–50% in intention-to-treat analyses, with sustained effects in many patients; medications are adjunctive, with lisdexamfetamine offering the most consistent short-term benefit for binge frequency but limited impact on weight and requiring careful risk–benefit assessment; weight management should be addressed in parallel when indicated, but BED treatment success should be judged primarily by reduction in binge eating and related psychopathology rather than weight change alone [^1128pRBQ] [^1116ymnD] [^113fnsZS]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially implied that medications have no role in weight outcomes; I should clarify that while some agents like topiramate or naltrexone/bupropion can produce modest weight reductions, these effects are inconsistent for binge outcomes and should not be conflated with treating the core disorder, reinforcing the need to prioritize evidence-based psychotherapies and to individualize pharmacotherapy within a multidisciplinary framework [^111AMQZu] [^114rnVvh] [^112vKMyB].

---

Binge eating disorder (BED) is best treated with **CBT as first-line** [^111FMGwC] therapy, with IPT and lisdexamfetamine as effective alternatives [^113fnsZS] [^1116ymnD]. CBT and IPT yield **~50% abstinence** [^1128pRBQ] and durable remission, while lisdexamfetamine is the only FDA-approved medication and reduces binge frequency and weight [^114AbCu3] [^111AMQZu]. For broader access, **guided self-help** [^113fnsZS] and digital CBT are effective options [^114JiWLp] [^111rvPLu]. Treatment should be individualized, with stepped care and multidisciplinary management for comorbidities and severe cases [^112vKMyB] [^112NHjAN].

---

## Psychological treatments

### Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)

- **First-line**: CBT is the most effective treatment for BED, with ~50% abstinence and sustained remission [^1128pRBQ].
- **Mechanism**: Targets binge triggers, cognitive distortions, and behaviors via self-monitoring, cognitive restructuring, and relapse prevention [^111MbxLK].
- **Formats**: Individual, group, and guided self-help (CBTgsh) are effective; CBTgsh is a scalable first-line option [^113fnsZS] [^115fXxoy].

---

### Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT)

IPT is **effective**, particularly for patients with high eating disorder psychopathology or interpersonal difficulties, and achieves abstinence rates comparable to CBT [^113fnsZS] [^111xDJqv].

---

### Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)

DBT is useful for patients with **emotion regulation deficits** and reduces binge frequency and distress, though evidence is less robust than for CBT and IPT [^111xDJqv] [^112zZU7H].

---

### Behavioral weight loss (BWL)

BWL reduces binge frequency and weight in the **short term** but is less effective than CBT/IPT for long-term abstinence; it may suit patients prioritizing weight loss [^113fnsZS] [^112hH7LG].

---

## Pharmacological treatments

### Lisdexamfetamine

Lisdexamfetamine is the **only FDA-approved medication** for BED; it significantly reduces binge frequency and weight in adults [^116gUBQv] [^116mrMKq] [^114AbCu3]. Cardiovascular effects, insomnia, anxiety, and misuse risk require monitoring [^notfound].

---

### Antidepressants

SSRIs and other antidepressants have **modest efficacy** for reducing binge frequency and distress and may be used when comorbid depression/anxiety is present or when CBT is unavailable [^113kGt8u] [^116mrMKq].

---

### Topiramate

Topiramate reduces binge frequency and weight but is limited by **cognitive effects and paresthesia**; consider when other options are ineffective or contraindicated [^114bhNyN] [^113zs9Ep].

---

## Combined treatments

Combined CBT plus pharmacotherapy (e.g. lisdexamfetamine or topiramate) can yield **additional benefits** over monotherapy, especially for refractory cases or when weight loss is desired [^114bhNyN] [^112fa3jb].

---

## Emerging and experimental treatments

- **Digital CBT**: Web-based guided self-help is effective and scalable, with recent RCTs showing noninferiority to usual care [^114JiWLp] [^113AuUwG].
- **Neuromodulation**: rTMS and other neuromodulation approaches are under study but remain investigational [^111fT9yt] [^113FV7C5].
- **New agents**: Research is exploring GLP-1 receptor agonists and other agents targeting reward/inhibitory control [^111fT9yt].

---

## Treatment selection and individualized care

- **Severity**: Use stepped care — start with CBTgsh or group CBT, escalate to individual CBT/IPT or add medication as needed [^113fnsZS] [^115fXxoy].
- **Comorbidities**: Tailor treatment to psychiatric and medical comorbidities; multidisciplinary care is recommended [^112vKMyB] [^112NHjAN].
- **Patient preference**: Incorporate patient values and readiness; preferences do not typically moderate outcomes between CBT and lisdexamfetamine [^113gNUo2] [^115f8aae].

---

## Long-term outcomes and relapse prevention

Long-term abstinence is **~50%** after CBT/IPT, with relapse risk mitigated by ongoing self-monitoring, booster sessions, and addressing weight/shape concerns [^1128pRBQ]. Relapse prevention relies on continued follow-up and support to sustain gains [^notfound].

---

## Barriers to treatment and access

Key barriers include **stigma, limited access to specialty care, and cost**; digital CBT and guided self-help help expand access [^114noTFx] [^114JiWLp]. Addressing stigma and training primary care providers can improve detection and engagement [^111pqqm4].

---

CBT is the **most effective first-line treatment** for BED, with IPT and lisdexamfetamine as strong alternatives; individualized, stepped care and multidisciplinary management optimize outcomes, and digital CBT enhances access.

### Diagnosis and management of binge eating disorder [^111rrq8n]. World Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

This paper addresses current issues regarding the diagnosis and management of binge eating disorder (BED). Controversies in diagnosis include the lack of empirically validated criteria, the lack of a universally recognized operational definition of a "binge episode", and the lack of age-appropriate assessment instruments in light of growing reports of BED among children and adolescents. For adults with BED, several pharmacological and behavioral treatments have shown promise in reducing binge frequency and related psychological symptoms of disordered eating (i.e., disinhibition, hunger, depressed mood). Second-generation antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy are among the most widely studied treatments. However, no behavioral interventions have demonstrated efficacy with respect to weight loss (which is a critical concern for many BED sufferers who are overweight). Furthermore, randomized controlled trials for BED have been plagued by high drop out and placebo response rates, as well as by insufficient follow-up after active treatment ends to determine long-term outcomes. Therefore, the long-term utility of the various intervention strategies studied thus far remains unclear. More research is needed on innovative medications and behavioral treatments that explore novel modalities to reduce the subjectively reinforcing properties of binge eating. In addition, expanded use of information technologies may be particularly instrumental in the treatment of patients who experience marked shame, denial, and interpersonal deficits, or who face limited access to specialty care. Ultimately, examining BED within the broader context of the current obesity epidemic will be an important area of study.

### What pharmacological interventions are effective in binge-eating disorder? Insights from a critical evaluation of the evidence from clinical trials [^111AMQZu]. International Journal of Obesity (2022). Medium credibility.

Binge-eating disorder (BED) is the commonest eating disorder and an important causal factor in obesity. Lisdexamfetamine is the only approved pharmacological treatment. Many drugs have been clinically evaluated and several were described as potentially promising treatments. A comprehensive reassessment of the evidence from these clinical trials has been performed. The questions to be answered were: (1) Does the evidence support claims of efficacy? (2) What pharmacological mechanisms show promise for developing new BED drugs? (3) What are the clinical implications for treating BED? PubMed and internal database searches identified every available published drug trial in BED. The trials and their results were summarised and reviewed to re-evaluate the evidence. Factors taken into consideration included psychiatric diagnosis, primary endpoint, secondary outcome measures, trial size, blinding and controls, drop-out rates, placebo response rates and weight-loss. Drugs were classified according to their pharmacology and therapeutic indication to determine which mechanisms were effective and to provide insights into the psychopathology of BED. For most drugs, robust evidence of efficacy in BED is insubstantial or absent. Some catecholaminergic drugs developed for ADHD are also effective in BED; other pharmacological mechanisms are weakly efficacious at best. Reducing BED severity has little impact on weight. Conversely, weight-loss from anti-obesity therapy is ineffective in ameliorating the psychopathological drivers of BED. (1) BED is a psychiatric not a metabolic disorder. (2) Weight-loss drugs are generally ineffective in BED. (3) Efficacy in BED is restricted to powerful catecholaminergic drugs. (4) Drugs acting via noradrenaline, 5-HT, GABA, carbonic anhydrase inhibition, opioid receptors and various ion channels are generally minimally effective at best. (5) Efficacy in BED is dependent on treating its core psychopathology; reducing impulsivity and compulsivity and increasing cognitive restraint over eating. (6) Obese subjects with BED may benefit from separate treatments for these two disorders.

### Web-based guided self-help vs treatment as usual for binge-eating disorder: a randomized clinical trial [^114JiWLp]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is web-based guided self-help noninferior to treatment as usual for adults with binge-eating disorder?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial of 187 adults with binge-eating disorder, web-based guided self-help was noninferior to treatment as usual in reducing binge-eating episodes at both the end of treatment and at 20 weeks after treatment.

Meaning

The findings of this study suggest that web-based guided self-help is an effective standalone treatment for adults with binge-eating disorder and may be beneficial for challenges in the global mental health field.

### Pharmacologic treatments for binge-eating disorder [^114DZcdL]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Binge-eating disorder (BED) is the most common eating disorder and is associated with poor physical and mental health outcomes. Psychological and behavioral interventions have been a mainstay of treatment for BED, but as understanding of this disorder has grown, pharmacologic agents have become promising treatment options for some patients. At this time, only one drug-the stimulant prodrug lisdexamfetamine-is approved for the treatment of BED. Numerous classes of medications including antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and antiobesity drugs have been explored as off-label treatments for BED with variable success. Although not all patients with BED may be suitable candidates for pharmacotherapy, all patients should be considered for and educated about pharmacologic treatment options.

### Binge eating disorder: a psychiatrist's commentary on clinical considerations [^114H3f61]. Clinical Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Of the 3 major eating disorders, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder (BED), BED is the most common and exists in the practices of most primary care and psychiatric clinicians. However, BED often goes unrecognized and thus untreated.

Methods

Reviewed in this commentary are the basic elements in the diagnosis of BED, demographic and clinical characteristics, screening options, the importance of comorbidities, pathophysiology, and available treatments.

Findings

Psychological treatments, including cognitive-behavioral therapy, interpersonal therapy, and behavioral weight loss, have been recommended as first-line options and are supported by several different meta-analytic reviews. Lisdexamfetamine is currently the only medication approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of BED. Effect sizes for lisdexamfetamine versus placebo for response, remission, and avoidance of relapse in BED are robust, but its use may be limited by tolerability. This is also the case for topiramate, an anticonvulsant that has been used "off-label" to treat BED.

Implications

Additional medication choices approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of BED are needed. Moving forward, opportunities to leverage modern technology to broaden access to treatment are highly desirable.

### Understanding and coping with binge eating disorder: the patient's perspective [^111pqqm4]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Binge eating disorder (BED) is the most common of the 6 feeding and eating disorders recognized by the DSM-5 and a significant public health problem that can be successfully managed with appropriate help. Many patients, however, are hesitant to discuss the symptoms of BED with their providers because of embarrassment or because they simply do not recognize the behavior as a problem behavior. Clinicians need to increase their awareness of BED, its warning signs, and how and why patients might try to hide it leading to increased BED recognition and timely diagnosis. Then, given the right tools, clinicians can help patients to not only accept the diagnosis and look into various treatment options but also to move beyond it to recognize if any comorbid disorders are present and in need of treatment.

### Eating disorders guidelines from NICE [^113KoFLa]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

January, 2004, marked the publication of NICE guidelines for the treatment of eating disorders, a series of recommendations from a multidisciplinary, comprehensive, and rigorous process. The recommendations are assigned a grade from A (strong empirical support from well-conducted randomised trials) to C (expert opinion without strong empirical data). Over 100 recommendations were made, most of which were given a C grade. No specific recommendations were made for anorexia nervosa. Cognitive behavioural therapy for bulimia nervosa was assigned grade A because of the evidence showing that it is superior to other psychological and drug treatments. Antidepressants for bulimia nervosa were given grade B. No specific recommendations were made for atypical eating disorders except for binge-eating disorder (cognitive behavioural therapy was recommended [A]).

Starting Point

The methodological rigour of the NICE guidelines is in contrast with the current Practice Guideline for Eating Disorders (PGED) of the American Psychiatric Association. PGED does not detail criteria for evaluating supporting research. Instead of making clear recommendations, PGED is uncritically inclusive and emphasises subjective judgment of individual clinicians. The NICE guidelines balance recommending specific treatments against the importance of clinical judgment when guideline recommendations are not readily applicable.

Where Next

Evidence-based guidelines are limited by the quality of the available research and its clinical relevance. The NICE guidelines underscore the absence of sufficient evidence for guidance in several important areas, such as atypical eating disorders (eating disorders not otherwise specified) which are the most common. Research on the treatment of these atypical eating disorders is needed. Evidence-based psychological treatments are not routinely implemented in general practice. Dissemination of these demonstrably effective treatments poses a challenge, and learning how to implement evidence-based psychological treatments and monitor their use is a research priority.

### Binge eating disorder [^116t15E5]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2022). High credibility.

Binge eating disorder (BED) is characterized by regular binge eating episodes during which individuals ingest comparably large amounts of food and experience loss of control over their eating behaviour. The worldwide prevalence of BED for the years 2018–2020 is estimated to be 0.6–1.8% in adult women and 0.3–0.7% in adult men. BED is commonly associated with obesity and with somatic and mental health comorbidities. People with BED experience considerable burden and impairments in quality of life, and, at the same time, BED often goes undetected and untreated. The aetiology of BED is complex, including genetic and environmental factors as well as neuroendocrinological and neurobiological contributions. Neurobiological findings highlight impairments in reward processing, inhibitory control and emotion regulation in people with BED, and these neurobiological domains are targets for emerging treatment approaches. Psychotherapy is the first-line treatment for BED. Recognition and research on BED has increased since its inclusion into DSM-5; however, continuing efforts are needed to understand underlying mechanisms of BED and to improve prevention and treatment outcomes for this disorder. These efforts should also include screening, identification and implementation of evidence-based interventions in routine clinical practice settings such as primary care and mental health outpatient clinics.

### Binge eating disorder treatment: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^115sVX36]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The Research Triangle Institute-University of North Carolina Evidence Based Practice Center (RTI-EPC) systematically reviewed evidence on efficacy of treatment for binge eating disorder (BED), harms associated with treatments, factors associated with treatment efficacy, and differential outcome by sociodemographic characteristics.

Method

We searched six major databases for studies on the treatment of BED published from 1980 to September, 2005, in all languages against a priori inclusion/exclusion criteria and focused on eating, psychiatric or psychological, or biomarker outcomes.

Results

Twenty-six studies, including medication-only, medication plus behavioral intervention, and behavioral intervention only designs, met inclusion criteria. The strength of the evidence for medication and behavioral interventions was moderate, for self-help and other interventions was weak, for treatment-related harms was strong, for factors associated with efficacy of treatment was weak, and for differential outcome by sociodemographic factors was nonexistent. Individual or group CBT reduces binge eating and improves abstinence rates for up to 4 months after treatment but does not lead to weight loss. Medications may play a role in treating BED patients.

Conclusion

The literature regarding treatment efficacy for BED is variable. Future directions include the identification of optimal interventions that are associated with both sustained abstinence from binge eating and permanent weight loss.

### Emerging treatments in eating disorders [^113WLggf]. Neurotherapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Eating disorders (EDs), including anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder, constitute a class of common and deadly psychiatric disorders. While numerous studies in humans highlight the important role of neurobiological alterations in the development of ED-related behaviors, the precise neural substrate that mediates this risk is unknown. Historically, pharmacological interventions have played a limited role in the treatment of eating disorders, typically providing symptomatic relief of comorbid psychiatric issues, like depression and anxiety, in support of the standard nutritional and psychological treatments. To date there are no Food and Drug Administration-approved medications or procedures for anorexia nervosa, and only one Food and Drug Administration-approved medication each for bulimia nervosa (fluoxetine) and binge-eating disorder (lisdexamfetamine). While there is little primary interest in drug development for eating disorders, postmarket monitoring of medications and procedures approved for other indications has identified several novel treatment options for patients with eating disorders. In this review, I utilize searches of the PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov databases to highlight emerging treatments in eating disorders.

### The three-legged stool of evidence-based practice in eating disorder treatment: research, clinical, and patient perspectives [^115gWYGQ]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Summary

In summary, each 'leg' of evidence-based practice provides an integral component of eating disorder treatment. The three-legged stool nonetheless requires extensive data, expertise, and knowledge to ensure that each leg is equally sturdy. Research indicates that, for the treatment of bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder, CBT and IPT have strong empirical support whereas DBT and certain types of medications have modest support. FBT has been found to be efficacious in children and adolescents with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, for whom timely interventions are particularly crucial. The identification of reliable treatment predictors, moderators, and mediators will be especially useful in determining optimal treatment. Clinical expertise is essential for tailoring interventions for both existing and emerging treatments as well as determining care when empirical data are lacking. Preliminary data support the potential importance of patient perspectives, values, and preferences in optimizing treatment outcome, although the clinical features of eating disorders may complicate this process among individuals who are frightened of or ambivalent about treatment. Empirical examinations of emerging treatments may increase the breadth of treatment options supported by data, although the use of clinical expertise and patient preferences and values may help to develop novel treatments, determine treatment when evidence-based interventions have not been identified, and facilitate dissemination and prevention efforts. Finally, future investigations are critical, particularly to determine more efficacious eating disorder treatments, to examine patient preferences in the context of randomized clinical trials, and to identify effective treatment dissemination and implementation strategies to better serve clinicians in the community providing care to patients.

### Binge eating disorder [^113tAxns]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Binge eating disorder (BED) is the most common eating disorder and an important public health problem. Lifetime prevalence of BED in the United States is 2.6%. In contrast to other eating disorders, the female to male ratio in BED is more balanced. BED co-occurs with a plethora of psychiatric disorders, most commonly mood and anxiety disorders. BED is also associated with obesity and its numerous complications. Although BED is similar in men and women in presentation and treatment outcomes, there are some key neurobiological differences that should be taken in consideration when personalizing treatment.

### The multimodal treatment of eating disorders [^111P1RyM]. World Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

The treatment of eating disorders is based on a multimodal model, recognizing that these disorders do not have a single cause or a predictable course. The treatment strategy is determined by the severity of illness and the specific eating disorder diagnosis. For the treatment of anorexia nervosa, the key elements are medical management, behavioral therapy, cognitive therapy and family therapy, while pharmacotherapy is at best an adjunct to other therapies. In bulimia nervosa, the treatment of choice is cognitive-behavioral therapy, but a greater improvement in mood and anxiety occurs when antidepressant therapy is added. In binge eating disorder, cognitive-behavioral therapy and interpersonal therapy produce substantial and long-lasting changes and pharmacological treatment has often a useful role.

### Binge eating disorder and obesity in 2003: could treating an eating disorder have a positive effect on the obesity epidemic? [^112aMmFp]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between binge eating disorder (BED) and obesity.

Methods

Recent literature relating to the etiology, risk factors, pathophysiology, and treatment of binge eating disorder was reviewed.

Results

The data suggest that binge eating may be a contributor to the development of obesity in susceptible individuals. Although eating disorders treatment in the absence of obesity treatment does not result in large weight losses, amelioration of binge eating does result in small weight losses and decreased weight regain over time.

Discussion

Our challenge in the future is to understand better the ways in which BED and obesity co-exist, and to find treatment strategies that will relieve the distress and dysfunction due to this disordered eating while enhancing appropriate weight loss or preventing further weight gain.

### Binge-eating disorder and obesity. A combined treatment approach [^116h6KL6]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Patients presenting with both obesity and BED face multiple challenges: normalizing their eating, improving their physical health, and working to enhance their own acceptance of their body image. In an effort to feel better about themselves, they often have become trapped in a cycle of desperately attempting to diet, then losing control, binge eating, and gaining even more weight. Several psychological and pharmacologic treatment approaches have been used in this population. Most suppress binge eating in the short term, and some seem promising in the long term as well. However, sustained weight loss remains a largely unrealized goal. More recently, BED treatment programs have attempted to address these goals sequentially or in combination. In either approach, it is clear that adopting a long-term focus and promoting enhanced self-acceptance, which have so often been missing from these patients' previous attempts at recovery, are important tasks of treatment that are likely to lead to beneficial lifestyle changes and long-term improvements in physical and psychological health.

### Naltrexone / bupropion for binge-eating disorder: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^114rnVvh]. Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Binge-eating disorder (BED) is a prevalent psychiatric disorder associated with obesity. Few evidence-based treatments exist for BED, particularly pharmacological options. This study tested the efficacy of naltrexone/bupropion for BED.

Methods

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week trial tested naltrexone/bupropion for BED with and without obesity. Eighty-nine patients (70.8% women, 69.7% White, mean age 45.7 y, mean BMI 35.1kg/m², 77.5% with BMI ≥ 30kg/m²) were randomized to placebo (n = 46) or naltrexone/bupropion (n = 43), with randomization stratified by obesity status and gender; 92.1% completed post-treatment assessments.

Results

Mixed models of binge-eating frequency revealed significant reductions that did not differ significantly between naltrexone/bupropion and placebo. Logistic regression of binge-eating remission rates revealed that naltrexone/bupropion and placebo did not differ significantly. Obesity status did not predict, or moderate, binge-eating outcomes considered either continuously or categorically. Mixed models revealed that naltrexone/bupropion was associated with significantly greater percentage weight loss than placebo. Logistic regression revealed that naltrexone/bupropion had significantly higher rates of attaining ≥ 5% weight loss than placebo (27.9% vs. 6.5%). Obesity status did not predict or moderate weight-loss outcomes.

Conclusions

Naltrexone/bupropion did not demonstrate effectiveness for reducing binge eating relative to placebo but showed effectiveness for weight reduction in patients with BED. Obesity status did not predict or moderate medication outcomes.

### Binge-eating disorder [^112xoGKA]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Binge-eating disorder (BED), first included as a diagnostic entity in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition, is characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating without regular compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain. With a complex multifactorial etiology, BED is the most frequent eating disorder co-occuring with significant psychopathology, mental and physical comorbidity, obesity, and life impairment. Despite its significance, BED is not sufficiently diagnosed or treated. Evidence-based treatments for BED include psychotherapy and structured self-help treatment, with cognitive-behavioral therapy as most well-established approach, and pharmacotherapy with lisdexamfetamine as FDA approved medication with a limitation of use.

### Binge eating disorder: from clinical research to clinical practice [^114HfkL4]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

This case report describes the clinical course of a young woman suffering from binge eating disorder (BED) associated with obesity. It illustrates the efficacy of different medications in the treatment of BED and related conditions and is followed by the comments and clinical observations of 2 practicing psychiatrists. The issues described in this paper have important clinical implications and are topical, given that BED is now recognized as a specific disorder in the new Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition classification system, but neither the US Food and Drug Administration nor any other regulatory agency has yet approved a drug for treatment of this disease, despite its very prevalent and disabling nature. Growing evidence from the fields of psychopathology and neurobiology, including preclinical and clinical studies, converges to support the idea that "overeating" has much in common with other behavioral addictions, and substance abuse treatment agents may show promise for the treatment of BED.

### A systematic review of evidence for psychological treatments in eating disorders: 2005–2012 [^113m8u2b]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To update new evidence for psychotherapies in eating disorders (EDs) since 2005-September 2012.

Method

Completed and published in the English language randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified by SCOPUS search using terms "bulimia" or "binge eating disorder" (BED) or "anorexia nervosa" (AN) or "eating disorder" and "treatment", and 36 new RCTs met inclusion criteria.

Results

There has been progress in the evidence for family based treatment in adolescents with AN, for cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) in full and guided forms, and new modes of delivery for bulimia nervosa (BN), BED, and eating disorder not otherwise specified with binge eating. Risk of bias was low to moderate in 22 (61%) of RCTs.

Discussion

The evidence base for AN has improved and CBT has retained and extended its status as first-line therapy for BN. However, further research is needed, in particular noninferiority trials of active therapies and the best approach to addressing ED features and weight management in co-morbid BED and obesity.

### Combining pharmacological and psychological treatments for binge eating disorder: current status, limitations, and future directions [^114bhNyN]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Binge eating disorder (BED) is characterized by recurrent binge eating and marked distress about binge eating without the extreme compensatory behaviors for weight control that characterize other eating disorders. BED is prevalent, associated strongly with obesity, and is associated with heightened levels of psychological, psychiatric, and medical concerns. This article provides an overview of randomized controlled treatments for combined psychological and pharmacological treatment of BED to inform current clinical practice and future treatment research. In contrast to the prevalence and significance of BED, to date, limited research has been performed on combining psychological and pharmacological treatments for BED to enhance outcomes. Our review here found that combining certain medications with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or behavioral weight loss (BWL) interventions produces superior outcomes to pharmacotherapy only but does not substantially improve outcomes achieved with CBT/BWL only. One medication (orlistat) has improved weight losses with CBT/BWL albeit minimally, and only one medication (topiramate) has enhanced reductions achieved with CBT in both binge eating and weight. Implications for future research are discussed.

### State of the art: the therapeutic approaches to bulimia nervosa [^112MAF7N]. Clinical Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Bulimia nervosa (BN) is an eating disorder characterized by binge eating, inappropriate compensatory behaviors, and body image concerns in persons at or above a healthy weight. BN is a serious disorder with medical sequelae and marked psychosocial impairment. To reduce and eliminate symptoms of BN, psychological and pharmacologic treatments for BN have been developed. We review the current state-of-the-art treatments for BN.

Methods

We conducted a narrative review of the BN treatment literature to synthesize the current evidence base, provide recommendations, and propose future directions for BN treatment research.

Findings

Currently, the first-line, state-of-the-art treatment for adults with BN is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Interpersonal therapy is a second-line evidence-based treatment for adults with BN, and dialectical behavior therapy and integrative cognitive-affective therapy are also promising. For BN in adolescents, family-based treatment for BN or CBT are evidence-based approaches. Pharmacotherapy is best considered adjunctive to psychotherapy in adults with BN but may be helpful, depending on the type of psychotherapy and whether psychotherapy is ineffective or unavailable. Fluoxetine 60 mg/d is the medication of choice for adults with BN. Little is known with respect to pharmacologic treatment of BN in adolescents, although fluoxetine 60 mg/d holds promise.

Implications

Despite decades of treatment-development research in BN, there is room for improvement because nearly 60% of those with BN do not achieve remission with specialty treatment and strikingly few randomized controlled trials for BN in adolescents exist. Moreover, the field should address issues related to treatment dissemination, access, and cost.

### Review and meta-analysis of pharmacotherapy for binge-eating disorder [^112fa3jb]. Obesity (2008). Low credibility.

This study evaluated available controlled treatment studies to determine utility of pharmacotherapy for binge-eating disorder (BED). The authors identified randomized placebo-controlled trials testing pharmacotherapy-only treatments and controlled trials testing pharmacotherapy with psychotherapy treatments. Meta-analysis was performed on placebo-controlled trials with data for attrition, remission, and weight loss. Qualitative review was performed on remaining controlled treatment literature. A total of 33 studies were considered of which 14 studies with a total of 1,279 patients were included in the meta-analysis of pharmacotherapy-only treatment and 8 studies with a total of 683 patients were included in the qualitative review of pharmacotherapy combined with psychotherapy interventions. No evidence suggested significant differences between medication and placebo for attrition. Evidence suggested that pharmacological treatments have a clinically significant advantage over placebo for achieving short-term remission from binge eating (48.7% vs. 28.5%) and for weight loss, although weight losses are not substantial. No data exist to allow evaluation of longer-term effects of pharmacotherapy-only treatment for BED. Combining medications with psychotherapy interventions failed to significantly enhance binge outcomes, although specific medications (orlistat, topiramate) enhanced weight losses achieved with cognitive behavioral therapy and behavioral weight loss. In summary, BED patients can be advised that certain pharmacotherapies may enhance likelihood of stopping binge eating short term, but that longer-term effects are unknown. Although some weight loss may occur, it is unlikely to be substantial with available medications. Combining medications with cognitive or behavioral treatments is unlikely to enhance binge outcomes, but specific medications (orlistat, topiramate) may enhance weight losses, albeit modestly.

### Binge-eating disorder and comorbid conditions: differential diagnosis and implications for treatment [^1145uEWw]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Many patients with symptoms of binge-eating disorder (BED) are not diagnosed. Perhaps the biggest obstacles are the failure of physicians to recognize BED as a distinct disorder and the lack of awareness among patients that binge-eating is a well-studied abnormal behavior that is amenable to treatment. In addition, patients may avoid seeking treatment because they feel a general sense of shame over their eating habits and do not want to bring up these symptoms during visits with their physicians. In general, negative attitudes and biases regarding overweight and obesity are common. The presence of medical and psychiatric comorbidities also contributes to the challenge of diagnosis, as many doctors focus on treating those comorbidities, thereby delaying treatment for the BED and leading to suboptimal care. Once BED is diagnosed along with any comorbid conditions, medications for the treatment of the comorbidities must be carefully considered so that BED symptoms are not exacerbated.

### Psychological treatments for binge eating disorder [^112zZU7H]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Binge eating disorder (BED) is the most prevalent eating disorder in adults, and individuals with BED report greater general and specific psychopathology than non-eating disordered individuals. The current paper reviews research on psychological treatments for BED, including the rationale and empirical support for cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), behavioral weight loss (BWL), and other treatments warranting further study. Research supports the effectiveness of CBT and IPT for the treatment of BED, particularly for those with higher eating disorder and general psychopathology. Guided self-help CBT has shown efficacy for BED without additional pathology. DBT has shown some promise as a treatment for BED, but requires further study to determine its long-term efficacy. Predictors and moderators of treatment response, such as weight and shape concerns, are highlighted and a stepped-care model proposed. Future directions include expanding the adoption of efficacious treatments in clinical practice, testing adapted treatments in diverse samples (e.g., minorities and youth), improving treatment outcomes for nonresponders, and developing efficient and cost-effective stepped-care models.

### Matching patient variables to treatment intensity. the continuum of care [^111KWkSH]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

This article has reviewed what is currently known regarding the relationship between specific patient variables and treatment response in AN, BN, and BED. Matching patient variables to treatment intensity remains an important and fruitful area for future research. There is a need for established guidelines for clinicians regarding the choice of the appropriateness of treatment settings and type of interventions delivered in those settings. These guidelines should be evidence based, with clear clinical indicators for each of the recognized eating disorders and their subclinical variants.

### Weight control beliefs in the treatment of binge-eating disorder: why might they matter? [^1166jq76]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The belief in personal control over weight (BCWeight) is positively associated, while the belief in control over healthy lifestyle with weight acceptance (BCLifestyle) is negatively associated with disordered eating, body dissatisfaction, and low self-esteem. This study examined how weight control beliefs are impacted by cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for binge-eating disorder (BED) that provides evidence and choice regarding weight management options; and assessed whether changes in weight control beliefs are associated with treatment outcomes.

Method

Participants were 57 patients consecutively referred to an outpatient eating disorder clinic from 2013–2017 for BED treatment. Using retrospective self-reported program-evaluation data, baseline to post-CBT changes in weight control beliefs were evaluated, as well as whether these changes were associated with the change in the drive for thinness, body dissatisfaction, fear of loss of control over eating, and self-esteem.

Results

BCLifestyle significantly increased over CBT; BCWeight significantly decreased. Increases in BCLifestyle were associated with the reduced drive for thinness, body dissatisfaction, and fear of loss of control overeating. Decreases in BCWeight were associated with improved self-esteem.

Discussion

BED CBT that provides science on weight management options is associated with positive changes in weight control beliefs, which are associated with measures of recovery from BED.

Public Significance Statement

Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for binge-eating disorder decreases the belief that one can and should control one's weight, and increases the belief that one should strive for a healthy lifestyle and accept one's weight. These changes in beliefs are associated with improved treatment outcomes. CBT that gives patients evidence on different weight management options addresses patient obesity concerns and is related to positive change in weight control beliefs.

- height and weight history (maximum and minimum weight, recent weight changes)

- presence of, patterns in, and changes in restrictive eating, food avoidance, binge eating, and other eating-related behaviors (rumination, regurgitation, chewing, and spitting)

- patterns and changes in food repertoire (breadth of food variety, narrowing or elimination of food groups)

- presence of, patterns in, and changes in compensatory and other weight control behaviors, including dietary restriction, compulsive or driven exercise, purging behaviors (laxative use, self-induced vomiting), and use of medication to manipulate weight

- percentage of time preoccupied with food, weight, and body shape

- prior treatment and response to treatment for an eating disorder

- psychosocial impairment secondary to eating or body image concerns or behaviors

- family history of eating disorders, other psychiatric illnesses, and other medical conditions (obesity, IBD, diabetes mellitus).

### Web-based guided self-help vs treatment as usual for binge-eating disorder: a randomized clinical trial [^1115uNKS]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Binge-eating disorder (BED) is the most prevalent eating disorder, characterized by recurrent binge-eating episodes and marked distress around binge eating. Unlike other eating disorders, those with BED do not use compensatory behaviors such as fasting or purging.BED affects approximately 1.5% of women and 0.3% of men worldwide, with a lifetime prevalence of 0.6% to 1.8% for women and 0.3% to 0.7% for men.BED is associated with medical complications, excessive weight gain, and psychosocial impairment.

Guidelines recommend specialized individual treatment for BED using a cognitive-behavioral framework, such as cognitive behavior therapy-enhanced (CBT-E). However, there is little consensus across guidelines worldwide on treatment intensity. In the United Kingdom and Australia, guided self-help is recommended as a first line of treatment and stand-alone therapy, whereas in the Netherlands, Dutch guidelines recommend individual CBT-based treatment as a first line of care. These contrasting recommendations may be attributed to the lack of conclusive evidence on the effectiveness of guided self-help compared with treatment-as-usual CBT-E. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has highlighted the importance of researching the clinical effectiveness of CBT-based guided self-help for adults with BED.

Recommended treatments are successful in achieving full remission from binge eating in approximately 50% of individuals seeking treatment. A 2019 meta-analysis, including 81 randomized clinical trials with 7515 individuals, found that the posttreatment abstinence from a binge-eating rate was 53% (95% CI, 45%-61%) greater for in-person psychological treatment compared with an inactive control group. For self-help programs, an abstinence rate of 46% (95% CI, 33%-59%) over 1 year was found. Although dropout was lower in the in-person psychological treatment group compared with self-help, a lack of dropout heterogeneity among included studies was found (I² = 0%). When comparing treatment outcomes of 3 randomized clinical trials on guided self-help programs with standard treatment, no short-term or long-term differences have been found.

Unguided self-help (6 trials; n = 368) also favored intervention, but the difference between groups was not statistically significant (SMD, −0.18 [95% CI, −0.38 to 0.03]). Self-help interventions reduced depression.

### Pediatric feeding and eating disorders: current state of diagnosis and treatment [^115ERLcn]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2014). Low credibility.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders now recognizes six primary feeding and eating disorders including pica, rumination disorder, avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder. Guided by research from the past 3 years, the current review outlines diagnostic criteria for each disorder, their clinical correlates and treatment options. Recent modifications to diagnostic criteria will likely help to improve treatment outcomes and prognosis. Nevertheless, several concerns remain regarding the validity of current diagnostic criteria for youth, including the clinical relevance of the size and frequency of binge eating episodes. Additionally, the lack of randomized controlled trials has led to an overreliance on data from quasi-experimental studies, case series and single case studies that impede development of strong clinical recommendations for treating feeding and eating disorders. Recommendations for future research include identifying empirically supported treatments and prevention programs focused on early markers of pediatric feeding and eating concerns.

### Rates of abstinence following psychological or behavioral treatments for binge-eating disorder: meta-analysis [^1128pRBQ]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Standardized effect sizes reported in previous meta-analyses of binge-eating disorder (BED) treatment are sometimes difficult to interpret and are criticized for not being a useful indicator of the clinical importance of a treatment. Abstinence from binge eating is a clinically relevant component of a definition of a successful treatment outcome. This meta-analysis estimated the prevalence of patients with BED who achieved binge eating abstinence following psychological or behavioral treatments.

Method

This meta-analysis included 39 randomized controlled trials, with 65 treatment conditions and 2,349 patients. Most conditions comprised cognitive-behavioral therapy (n = 40). Pooled event rates were calculated at posttreatment and follow-up using random effects models.

Results

The total weighted percentage of treatment-completers who achieved abstinence at posttreatment was 50.9% (95% CI = 43.9, 57.8); this estimate was almost identical at follow-up (50.3%; 95% CI = 43.6, 56.9). The total weighted percentage of patients who achieved abstinence at posttreatment in the intention-to-treat analysis (all randomized patients) was 45.1% (95% CI = 40.7, 49.5), and at follow-up it was 42.3% (95% CI = 37.5, 47.2). Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) produced the highest abstinence rates. Clinician-led group treatments produced significantly higher posttreatment (but not follow-up) abstinence estimates than guided self-help treatments. Neither timeframe for achieving abstinence, assessment type (interview/questionnaire), number of treatment sessions, patient demographics, nor trial quality, moderated the abstinence estimates.

Discussion

The present findings demonstrate that 50% of patients with BED do not fully respond to treatment. Continued efforts toward improving eating disorder treatments are needed.

### Eating disorders in primary care: diagnosis and management [^116HyPBo]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Eating disorders are potentially life-threatening conditions characterized by disordered eating and weight-control behaviors that impair physical health and psychosocial functioning. Early intervention may decrease the risk of long-term pathology and disability. Clinicians should interpret disordered eating and body image concerns and carefully monitor patients' height, weight, and body mass index trends for subtle changes. After diagnosis, visits should include the sensitive review of psychosocial and clinical factors, physical examination, orthostatic vital signs, and testing (e.g., a metabolic panel with magnesium and phosphate levels, electrocardiography) when indicated. Additional care team members (i.e., dietitian, therapist, and caregivers) should provide a unified, evidence-based therapeutic approach. The escalation of care should be based on health status (e.g., acute food refusal, uncontrollable binge eating or purging, co-occurring conditions, suicidality, test abnormalities), weight patterns, outpatient options, and social support. A healthy weight range is determined by the degree of malnutrition and pre-illness trajectories. Weight gain of 2.2 to 4.4 lb per week stabilizes cardiovascular health. Treatment options may include cognitive behavior interventions that address body image and dietary and physical activity behaviors; family-based therapy, which is a first-line treatment for youths; and pharmacotherapy, which may treat co-occurring conditions, but should not be pursued alone. Evidence supports select antidepressants or topiramate for bulimia nervosa and lisdexamfetamine for binge-eating disorder. Remission is suggested by healthy biopsychosocial functioning, cognitive flexibility with eating, resolution of disordered behaviors and decision-making, and if applicable, restoration of weight and menses. Prevention should emphasize a positive focus on body image instead of a focus on weight or dieting.

### Retention, engagement, and binge-eating outcomes: evaluating feasibility of the binge-eating genetics initiative study [^111MbxLK]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Binge‐eating disorder (BED) and bulimia nervosa (BN) are serious, often persist for years (mean duration of illness = 8–14 years [Hudson et al.]), carry high psychiatric and somatic comorbidity (Fichter & Quadflieg; Thornton et al; Welch et al.), elevated suicide risk (Crow; Forrest et al; Huas et al; Pisetsky et al.) and significant impairment (Kessler et al.). However, widely accessible, effective treatment for BED and BN is lacking. To increase reach of evidence‐based eating disorder (ED) treatments, we tested the feasibility of digital interventions using smartphones and wearable technology.

Although cognitive‐behavioral therapy (CBT) is the top evidence‐based treatment for BED and BN (Brownley et al; Hay et al; Shapiro et al.), problems with treatment delivery models challenge treatment potency (Kazdin et al.). First, the "dominant model of treatment delivery", CBT, is confined to the walls of the clinic, delivered by a trained mental health professional, and conducted face‐to‐face (Kazdin et al.). The reach of this model is poor. Second, this model of treatment delivery is underutilized (Kazdin et al.), with community studies in the United States indicating that only ~43.5% of individuals with a lifetime history of BED or BN have ever sought ED treatment (Hudson et al.), and poor engagement and dropout remain problematic (Beintner et al; Fassino et al; Waller). The delivery of face‐to‐face care has been further limited by the COVID‐19 pandemic (Termorshuizen et al.), highlighting the need for telehealth options. The United States also has a dire shortage of mental health providers (Health Resources & Services Administration; National Council for Mental Wellbeing; Thomas et al.) with competence in CBT for EDs (Agras et al; Mussell et al.), further impeding delivery of evidence‐based treatment. Third, interventions are typically confined to ≤ 50 min/week, without real‐time support in patients' daily lives (Tregarthen et al.), and traditional CBT approaches rely on retrospective self‐monitoring of "triggers" for ED behaviors (i.e. binge eating, purging), a central component of treatment (Barakat et al; Latner et al.). ED symptoms and meals are frequently recalled retrospectively in therapy sessions and are subject to memory decay, social desirability, recall bias, and mood (Schoch & Raynor; Smyth et al.).

### Topiramate for binge-eating disorder associated with obesity [^113zs9Ep]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the use of topiramate for the treatment of binge-eating disorder (BED) associated with obesity.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1966-July 2006) and the Cochrane Database (2006, issue 3) were used to conduct an English-language literature search. Key search terms included eating disorder, binge-eating, and topiramate. Bibliographies of identified articles were examined for additional references.

Data Synthesis

BED is characterized by excessive food intake with lack of control during eating episodes, but without subsequent compensatory weight loss mechanisms, and is often associated with obesity and psychiatric disorders. Evidence suggests that topiramate may have mood-stabilizing properties and cause decreased appetite and weight. One case series, 1 case report, 2 open-label studies, and 1 placebo-controlled trial have described the use of topiramate for BED associated with obesity. Doses ranging from 50 to 1400 mg/day were stated to be effective in these reports. Adverse reactions included paresthesias, cognitive impairment, somnolence, and gastrointestinal distress. Although these adverse effects were transient, they may interfere with patients' tolerability of topiramate therapy.

Conclusions

Albeit limited, evidence suggests that topiramate may be a viable short- and long-term treatment alternative for BED associated with obesity for patients with limited options. Further controlled trials are necessary to establish topiramate's place in therapy, optimal dosing, and length of treatment for this eating disorder.

### The treatment of obesity and its Co-occurrence with substance use disorders [^114uKVV6]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Obesity and binge eating disorder are detrimental health conditions that are associated with lower qualities of life. Individuals with obesity often face societal discrimination and frequently experience related medical disorders such as diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Current research suggests neurobiological similarities between obesity, binge eating disorder, and substance dependence. In addition, behavioral similarities link the two conditions; obese and substance dependent individuals often report similar features such as loss of control towards food or substances, respectively, and cravings. Treatment options for obesity have begun to use this information to formulate pharmacological and therapeutic interventions that may provide greater results for weight loss and decreased binge frequency. Similarly, treatment approaches to substance addictions should consider aspects of weight management. Findings from research and treatment studies are presented with the aim of reviewing the current literature of obesity within the context of an addiction framework and providing information on empirically supported approaches to the treatment of co-occurring obesity and substance addiction.

### Ecological momentary assessment to evaluate cognitive-behavioral treatment for binge eating disorder [^111fDPQx]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) for binge eating disorder (BED) is traditionally evaluated using clinical interviews and questionnaires. These retrospective assessment methods are discussed to be problematic due to memory recall error. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) might be promising for gathering ecologically valid and reliable data.

Method

We assessed the feasibility of and reactivity to EMA and compared the treatment efficacy measured by traditional vs. EMA-based instruments in 28 BED individuals participating in short-term CBT.

Results

Patients were highly compliant and we found no reactivity to EMA. Estimated treatment effects for binge eating based on EMA were comparable to questionnaire-based methods. The overall concordance between methods was moderate.

Discussion

Results suggest that binge eating over 1 week can be equally accurately assessed by EMA or by self-report questionnaires in BED treatment trials. EMA contributes to a detailed knowledge of binge eating in daily live and helps to advance treatment options.

### Acute augmentations to psychological therapies in eating disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113rbESQ]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Eating disorders represent a complex and varied range of disorders, across six main eating and feeding disorders. Three of these eating disorders (anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder) and the residual category of Other Specified Feeding and Eating Disorders (OSFED), are associated with evidence-based treatment. OSFED does not differ from the other eating disorders in terms of risk factors or impairment; even unhealthy weight control behaviours that do not meet diagnosis are associated with significantly higher economic costs among adolescents. These eating disorders are associated with an almost four-fold increased mortality compared to age- and sex-matched populations, the highest of any psychiatric disorder after substance use disorders. Treatment options range from outpatient psychological treatment involving family members in an age-appropriate manner (for mild or moderately severe cases) through to inpatient or day patient treatment for those with more severe medical or psychological risk, required for up to 35% of patients.

While large within-group effect sizes are obtained for eating disorder treatments using cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) in routine clinical care, with an attrition rate of 25.5%, CBT for bulimia nervosa produces abstinence in only 37.5% of completers. Specific psychological treatments for adult outpatients with anorexia nervosa are associated with modest improvements but no reliable evidence supports superiority of one approach over specialist, supportive psychotherapy. This situation is mirrored in other mental health problems, where "even the best therapies leave substantial proportions of patients with ongoing clinical problems" [p. 389,]. At least half of all patients with mental health disorders do not respond adequately to psychological therapy. For this reason, acute augmentations for psychological therapy have been proposed as a pathway to improve outcomes, especially where there is comorbidity and such augmentation may have transdiagnostic mechanisms and utility.

### Effectiveness of a web-based cognitive behavioral self-help intervention for binge eating disorder: a randomized clinical trial [^111rvPLu]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Control Group

Participants assigned to the control group did not receive access to the web-based intervention during the study. They were notified that they would gain access after a 12-week waiting period. To mimic naturalistic conditions in which individuals seeking help for BED might explore various treatment options, all participants, regardless of group assignment, could seek other types of pharmaceutical and psychological treatments. This design choice also facilitated the ethical consideration of not withholding effective treatment. Importantly, we closely monitored the initiation of other health care services in both groups throughout the studyto assess their impact on the intervention's effectiveness.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was a reduction in objective binge eating episodes from baseline to after treatment (using the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire). Secondary outcome measures were global eating psychopathology (using the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire); weekly loss of control eating, overeating, and binge eating (using the Weekly Binges Questionnaire); clinical impairment (using the Clinical Impairment Assessment Questionnaire scale); well-being (using the World Health Organization Well-Being Index-5 questionnaire); and work capacity (using the Institute for Medical Technology Assessment Productivity Cost Questionnaire). Exploratory outcomes were depressive symptoms (using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9), anxiety symptoms (using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7), self-esteem (using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale), and emotion regulation (using the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scaleand the Heidelberg Form for Emotion Regulation Strategies). Detailed descriptions of all scales and psychometric properties are provided in the study protocol (Supplement 1) and eTable 1 in Supplement 2.

Other Measures

Additional measures included an EMA protocolon participants' mobile devices for 5 days at baseline and after treatment. Furthermore, the study assessed measures of online intervention attitudes (using the Attitudes Toward Psychological Online Interventions scale), treatment expectations (using the Patients' Questionnaire on Therapy Expectation and Evaluation scale), adverse effects (using the Negative Effects Questionnaire), and health care service utilization (using the Client Sociodemographic and Service Receipt Inventory).

### The three-legged stool of evidence-based practice in eating disorder treatment: research, clinical, and patient perspectives [^115f8aae]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

A third consideration is the complexity of relying on patient preference given the nature of eating disorder psychopathology and the frequency of treatment refusal and ambivalence among individuals with eating disorders, particularly anorexia nervosa. Indeed, the fear of weight gain and overvaluation of shape and weight that characterize eating disorders may result in the rejection of interventions that serve as the basis of evidence-based treatment (e.g. self-monitoring, meal planning, behavioral exposure, consumption of feared foods, weight restoration to improve medical and cognitive status, involvement of family members). Alternatively, eating disorder psychopathology may influence the preference of treatments that potentially lead to weight loss (e.g. topiramate as a medication for binge eating). Given that these clinical features may, in fact, contribute to the maintenance of eating disorders, incorporating patient preference into treatment selection among individuals with eating disorders may be especially problematic and complicate treatment outcome. An additional consideration is that patients may express preferences for treatments that have been found to be ineffective in research trials. This scenario is especially problematic because it enables the patient to believe that they are engaged in treatment and yet they are not actually receiving an effective intervention. In evidence-based practice, clinicians must navigate the complexity of respecting patient desires while also relying on data and expertise to collaboratively identify more potentially efficacious treatment options. Finally, recognizing the potential influence of therapist factors on treatment selection, including anxiety, and which may interact with expressed patient preference, can help guide the clinician in treatment selection by recognizing potential vulnerabilities and biases.

In summary, minimal research has been conducted on the effects of treatment preference on outcome and attrition among patients with eating disorders; nevertheless, data from non-eating disorder psychiatric samples provide some support for the potential positive impact of patient preference on treatment outcome. The frequent occurrence of treatment refusal and ambivalence among individuals with eating disorders makes future investigations to determine the impact of treatment preference in eating disorders especially important.

### Reward and inhibitory control as mechanisms and treatment targets for binge eating disorder [^111fT9yt]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose of Review

Recent research has highlighted alterations in reward and inhibitory control among individuals with binge eating disorder, identifying both constructs as potential targets for treatment. Treatments targeting reward and inhibitory control for binge eating disorder are emerging. This review aims to summarize the recent literature evaluating reward and inhibitory control in binge eating disorder compared to weight-matched controls using behavioral paradigms and neuroimaging. This review also aims to summarize recent literature evaluating treatments for binge eating targeting these mechanisms and highlights additional work needed in these areas.

Recent Findings

Reward hypersensitivity and impaired inhibitory control are mechanisms underlying binge eating disorder. Individuals with binge eating disorder experience higher initial reward to food, and later, higher anticipatory reward but lower experienced food reward which maintains binge eating behavior. Treatments targeting reward and inhibitory control for binge eating include behavioral, computerized trainings, pharmacological, and neuromodulation treatments. The majority of trials are small but demonstrate promise in reducing binge eating and targeting theorized mechanisms. Larger, randomized trials are needed.

Summary

Changes in reward and inhibitory control are present in individuals with binge eating disorder and treatments targeting these mechanisms demonstrate initial promise. Greater research is needed evaluating reward and inhibitory control simultaneously and with weight-matched comparison groups, as well as larger randomized trials that target both processes simultaneously.

### Preferences for lisdexamfetamine vs cognitive-behavioral therapy for binge-eating disorder: correlates and outcomes [^113gNUo2]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Background: Efficacious treatments for binge-eating disorder (BED) have been identified, but research is lacking regarding patients' treatment preferences and their effects on outcomes. We investigated the frequency and correlates of patients' preferences for 2 distinct BED treatments-cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and lisdexamfetamine (LDX)-and whether preferences predicted and/or moderated outcomes.

Method: In a randomized controlled trial (performed March 2019 to September 2023) testing CBT and LDX for DSM-5 - defined BED, 102 participants indicated their preference after treatments were described and prior to beginning treatment. Treatment was randomly assigned (not influenced by preferences). Independent assessors, blinded to treatments and to patients' treatment preferences, performed outcome assessments.

Results: 43.1% (44/102) preferred LDX, 23.5% (24/102) preferred CBT, and 33.3% (34/102) reported no preference. Treatment preference was not significantly associated with any sociodemographic or baseline clinical characteristics. Logistic regression models (for binge-eating remission and attaining ≥ 5% weight loss) and mixed models (for changes in binge-eating frequency, weight, eating disorder psychopathology, and depression) testing main effects of treatments, main effects of treatment preferences, and their interaction effects converged. No significant interaction effects between treatment and treatment preferences were observed.

Conclusions: In this study comparing CBT and LDX treatments for BED in patients with obesity, participants' preferences for treatments were not associated with their sociodemographic or clinical characteristics and did not moderate treatment outcomes of these 2 effective interventions. Implications for clinical practice and future research are discussed.

Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03924193.

### Treatment of binge eating disorder [^111xDJqv]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

The two specialty psychological therapies of CBT and IPT remain the treatments of choice for the full range of BED patients, particularly those with high levels of specific eating disorder psychopathology such as overvaluation of body shape and weight. They produce the greatest degree of remission from binge eating as well as improvement in specific eating disorder psychopathology and associated general psychopathology such as depression. The CBT protocol evaluated in the research summarized above was the original manual from Fairburn and colleagues. Fairburn has subsequently developed a more elaborate and sophisticated form of treatment, namely, enhanced CBT (CBT-E) for eating disorders. Initial research suggests that CBT-E may be more effective than the earlier version with bulimia nervosa and Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified patients. CBT-E has yet to be evaluated for the treatment of BED, although it would currently be the recommended form of CBT. Of relevance in this regard is that the so-called broad form of the new protocol includes 3 optional treatment modules that could be used to address more complex psychopathology in BED patients. One of the modules targeted at interpersonal difficulties is IPT, as described earlier in this chapter. Thus, the broader protocol could represent a combination of the two currently most effective therapies for BED. Whether this combined treatment proves more effective than either of the components alone, particularly for a subset of BED patients with more complex psychopathology, remains to be tested. CBT-E also includes a module designed to address what Fairburn terms "mood intolerance" (problems in coping with negative affect) that can trigger binge eating and purging. The content and strategies of this mood intolerance module overlap with the emotional regulation and distress tolerance skills training of Linehan's dialectical behavior therapy (DBT). Two randomized controlled trials have tested the efficacy of an adaptation of DBT for the treatment of BED (DBT-BED) featuring mindfulness, emotion regulation, and distress tolerance training. A small study by Telch and colleagues found that modified DBT-BED was more effective than a wait list control in eliminating binge eating. A second study showed that DBT-BED resulted in a significantly greater remission rate from binge eating at posttreatment than a group comparison treatment designed to control for nonspecific therapeutic factors such as treatment alliance and expectations.50 This difference between the two treatments disappeared over a 12-month follow-up, indicating the absence of DBT-BED-specific influences on long-term outcomes. Both CBT and IPT have been shown to be more effective in eliminating binge eating than BWL in controlled, comparative clinical trials. Nonetheless, BWL has been effective in reducing binge eating and associated eating problems in BED patients in some studies and might be suitable for treatment of BED patients without high levels of specific eating disorder psychopathology. A finding worthy of future research is the apparent predictive value of early treatment response to BWL, indicating when BWL is likely to prove effective or not. No evidence supports the concern that BWL's emphasis on moderate caloric restriction either triggers or exacerbates binge eating in individuals with BED. Initially, CBTgsh was recommended as a feasible first-line treatment that might be sufficient treatment for a limited subset of patients in a stepped care approach. More recent research, however, has shown that CBTgsh seems to be as effective as a specialty therapy, such as IPT, with a majority of BED patients. The subset of patients that did not respond well to CBTgsh in this research were those with a high level of specific eating disorder psychopathology, as noted. A plausible explanation for this moderator effect is that the original Fairburn CBTgsh manual does not include an explicit emphasis on body shape and weight concerns. Subsequent implementation of this treatment has incorporated a module that directly addresses overvaluation of body shape and weight. Future research should determine whether an expanded form of CBTgsh is suitable for the full range of patients with BED. CBTgsh is recommended as a treatment for BED on two other counts. First, its brief and focused nature makes it cost effective. Second, its structured format makes it more readily disseminable than other longer, multicomponent psychological therapies. It can be implemented by a wider range of treatment providers than more technically complex, time-consuming, and clinical expertise-demanding specialty therapies such as CBT-E and IPT. The latter evidence-based therapies are rarely available to patients with BED in routine clinical care settings. Nevertheless, it must be noted that much of the research on CBTgsh to date has been conducted in an eating disorder specialty clinic setting. The degree to which the treatment can be adapted to a range of clinical service settings remains to be determined. In addition, little is known about the specific provider qualifications and level of expertise required to implement CBTgsh successfully. Despite its brief and focal nature, specific provider skills regarding what and what not to address in treatment are required. Currently available pharmacologic treatments cannot be recommended for treatment of BED. Aside from the inconsistent results of existing studies, the striking absence of controlled long-term evaluation of such treatment argues against its use. As summarized, the evidence-based treatments of CBT, IPT, and CBTgsh result in significant improvement and large treatment effects on multiple outcome measures aside from binge eating in overweight and obese patients. These include specific eating disorder psychopathology (eg, overvaluation of body shape and weight), general psychopathology (eg, depression), and psychosocial functioning. Moreover, these changes are typically well-maintained over 1 to 2 years of follow-up. The exception to this profile of improvement remains weight loss and its maintenance over time. These specialty psychological treatments do not produce weight loss, although successfully eliminating binge eating might protect against future weight gain. BWL consistently produces short-term weight loss, the extent of which has varied across different studies. Long-term weight loss has yet to be demonstrated, however. In this regard, the findings with obese patients with BED are not different than those on the treatment of obesity in general, in which there is little robust evidence of enduring weight loss effects of BWL.

### The efficacy of individual cognitive behavioral therapy for eating disorders: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^117GJgh2]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

A recent umbrella review regarding the efficacy of treatments for EDs that included a total of 884 studies concluded that individual CBT was more efficacious than other psychotherapies when treating BN (Monteleone et al.). For BED, the authors found that CBT was more efficacious than other psychotherapies for ED behaviors but not for cognitions or remission status. For AN, the authors were able to identify family‐based therapy as evidence‐based treatments for adolescents and young adults while they found no superiority of other treatments for adults. Regarding follow‐up, the umbrella review reported sustained treatment effects for BN and BED after undergoing psychotherapy but not medication.

Despite their contributions, prior meta‐analyses have limitations. Many have focused narrowly on specific ED diagnoses or have assessed broad, conflated outcomes (e.g. combined binge‐eating/purging behavior, or generalized "ED behaviors" across settings). Moreover, moderators of treatment efficacy were not consistently investigated.

Recent developments in the field further underscore the need for an updated synthesis. The inclusion of BED in the DSM‐5 (APA) and the 11th version of the International Classification of Disease (ICD‐11; World Health Organization) stimulated the intensified investigation of valid treatment options for BED. Moreover, new psychosocial treatment options such as third wave psychotherapies (e.g. Ben‐Porath et al; Brown et al; Haynos et al.) and treatment formats such as self‐help have emerged (e.g. Wilson and Zandberg; Yim and Schmidt). Since the publication of Linardon, Wade, et al.'s meta‐analysis, nearly a dozen new RCTs on CBT for EDs have been published (e.g. Hartmann et al; Melisse et al.), further expanding the evidence base.

Taken together, these limitations and recent advancements highlight the necessity for an updated, comprehensive meta‐analysis that incorporates the latest evidence, distinguishes between diagnoses and treatment formats, investigates moderators, and assesses key disorder‐specific outcomes, including weight gain in AN.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for binge eating disorder, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, APA 2023 guidelines recommend to assess the following during the initial psychiatric evaluation of patients with a possible eating disorder:

- weight measurement

- quantity of eating and weight control behaviors (frequency, intensity, or time spent on dietary restriction, binge eating, purging, exercise, and other compensatory behaviors)

- co-occurring health conditions, including psychiatric disorders

- a comprehensive review of systems.

### Meta-analysis of the effects of cognitive-behavioral therapy for binge-eating-type disorders on abstinence rates in nonrandomized effectiveness studies: comparable outcomes to randomized, controlled trials? [^111bjoba]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for eating disorders is well-established. The extent to which CBT tested in controlled research settings generalizes to real-world circumstances is unknown. We conducted a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies of CBT for eating disorders, with three aims: (a) to estimate the prevalence of patients who achieve binge-purge abstinence after CBT in routine practice; (b) to compare these estimates with those derived from two recent meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of CBT for bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge-eating disorder (BED); (c) to examine whether the degree of clinical representativeness of studies was associated with effect sizes.

Method

Twenty-seven studies, mainly involving BN, were included. Pooled event rates were calculated using random effects models.

Results

The percentage of treatment completers who achieved abstinence at post-treatment was 42.1% (95% CI = 34.7–50.0). The intention-to-treat (ITT) estimate was lower (34.6% [95% CI = 29.3–40.4]). However, abstinence rates varied across diagnoses, such that the completer and ITT analysis abstinence estimates were larger for BED samples (completer = 50.2%, 95% CI = 29.4–70.9; ITT = 47.2%, 95% CI = 29.8–65.2) than for BN (completer = 37.4%, 95% CI = 29.1–46.5; ITT = 29.8%, 95% CI = 24.9–35.3) and atypical eating disorder samples (completer = 37.8%, 95% CI = 20.2–59.3; ITT = 28.8%, 95% CI = 18.2–42.4). No relationship between the degree of clinical representativeness and the effect size was observed, and our estimates were highly comparable to those observed in recent meta-analyses of RCTs.

Discussion

Findings suggest that CBT for eating disorder can be effectively delivered in real-world settings. This study provides evidence for the generalizability of CBT from controlled research settings to routine clinical services.

### A critical evaluation of the efficacy of self-help interventions for the treatment of bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder [^115CBDc1]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is efficacious for the treatment of bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge-eating disorder (BED). As a number of factors limit the availability of CBT, self-help manuals have been developed to make the treatment more widely available.

Method

Published studies evaluating the efficacy of self-help programs in the treatment of BN and BED were reviewed.

Results

Controlled studies of self-help programs for BN and BED have often employed a waiting list control group, and indicate that self-help provides more benefit than remaining on a waiting list. However, fewer studies have utilized a more active control group, and these studies have not been as positive.

Conclusion

In general, open and wait-list trials indicate that self-help is helpful in treating BN and BED, but there is little evidence for the specific efficacy of self-help in comparison to other treatments. Additional studies of self-help are needed to determine the specific utility of self-help interventions for BN and BED.

### The meta-analytic evidence is in-time to get on and improve our treatments [^111uxuon]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

2 The Not‐So‐Good News

The not‐so‐good news is that these results don't really help clinicians make decisions about how to conduct their practice in the clinic. The guidance we can offer is as follows: we don't know whether to use CBT with adults who have anorexia nervosa; CBT is certainly better than doing nothing with the other eating disorder diagnostic groups, producing large effect size improvements in eating disorder pathology, moderate effect size improvements for objective binge episodes, and small effect size improvements in self‐esteem, depression, anxiety and quality of life (Cuijpers et al.); any form of therapist input will suffice as the length and intensity of the CBT makes no difference to outcomes, if we accept with some optimism that "more intensive and guided treatment formats tended to show a more consistent effect than unguided treatment formats" (Bruns et al.). Ultimately, we are unable to particularly recommend that they offer CBT, as all evidence‐based therapeutic approaches seem to perform the same.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with eating disorders [^111DznyZ]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2015). Medium credibility.

Bulimia nervosa (BN) — DSM-5 clinical presentation and course: Recurrent binge-eating is defined as consuming a very large amount of food in a discrete period, such as within 2 hours, with a sense of loss of control, and recurrent compensatory behaviors; these behaviors occur, on average, at least once a week for 3 months and do not occur exclusively during anorexia nervosa (AN). Patients with BN are often within a healthy or normal weight range. The short-term course features fluctuating symptoms, with individuals typically exhibiting symptoms for nearly 5 years before seeking treatment; among those who receive treatment, 50% are symptom free 5 to 10 years later, whereas the other 50% continue to exhibit eating disorder symptoms.

### A randomized comparison of cognitive behavioral therapy and behavioral weight loss treatment for overweight individuals with binge eating disorder [^112hH7LG]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and behavioral weight loss treatment (BWLT) for overweight patients with binge eating disorder (BED).

Method

Eighty obese patients meeting criteria of BED according to DSM-IV-TR were randomly assigned to either CBT or BWLT consisting of 16 weekly treatments and 6 monthly follow-up sessions. Binge eating, general psychopathology, and body mass index (BMI) were assessed before, during, and after treatment, and at 12-month follow-up.

Results

At posttreatment results favored CBT as the more effective treatment. Analysis of the course of treatments pointed to a faster improvement of binge eating in CBT based on the number of self-reported weekly binges, but faster reduction of BMI in BWLT. At 12-month follow-up, no substantial differences between the two treatment conditions existed.

Conclusion

CBT was somewhat more efficacious than BWLT in treating binge eating but this superior effect was barely maintained in the long term. Further research into cost effectiveness is needed to assess which treatment should be considered the treatment of choice.

How might treatment approaches differ in young people with an eating disorder in the context of neurodevelopmental disorder?

Neurodevelopmental disorders are common across mental disorders, and are especially associated with eating disorders. Studies report between 4 and 52.5% of participants with anorexia nervosa meet suggested clinical cut-off for ASD, with higher proportions in adult that in younger populations. This wide range reflects the heterogeneity in the diagnostic assessment across studies. ASD is also commonly comorbid with avoidant restrictive food intake disorder. Treatment adaptations for comorbid ASD are in development (e.g. the PEACE pathway;). The possibility of comorbid ASD is an important consideration when prescribing in terms of anticipated response, treatment duration and side effect sensitivity. In general, people with ASD are more likely to remain on medication and to be prescribed polypharmacy. What research there is, suggests autistic people may be more likely to experience side effects such as drowsiness, irritability and reduced activity.

ADHD is commonly comorbid in the context of bulimic and binge eating disorder (BED). Identification, assessment and treatment of comorbid ADHD may be helpful in addressing difficulties in impulsivity and self-regulation common to both disorders. The potential appetite suppressing effects of ADHD treatment should also be a consideration in evaluating the treatment options. Trials of lisdexamfetamine show favourable results compared with placebo on remission, change in body mass index (BMI) and binge eating in adults with BED. However, in trials, more people withdrew due to adverse events in the active arm, and there was a trend towards higher depression scores in the lisdexamphetamine arm compared with placebo. Lisdexamfetamine is not licenced in the United Kingdom for treatment of BED, but is licensed for treatment of ADHD. No pharmacological trials in young people with BED have been conducted as yet.

### Screening for eating disorders in adolescents and adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116mrMKq]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF screening evidence — pharmacotherapy trials for binge eating disorder and bulimia nervosa describe trial scope, durations, and key outcomes. Eighteen trials (n = 2433) compared pharmacotherapy with placebo, with most evaluating outcomes over a duration of 6 to 12 weeks and 3 trials over 16 weeks. For binge eating disorder, lisdexamfetamine (n = 900) produced larger reductions in Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for binge eating (YBOCS-BE) scores vs placebo (pooled mean difference, −5.75 [95% CI, −8.32 to −3.17]), and topiramate (n = 465) showed statistically significant larger reductions during the inpatient phase from −6.40 (P < .001) to −2.55 (P = 0.004). Across five trials (n = 208) of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for binge eating disorder and three trials (n = 528) of fluoxetine for bulimia nervosa, results for eating disorder symptom severity and depression were inconsistent, although two trials reported a reduction in symptom scores favoring SSRIs using the EDE-Q (Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire) and YBOCS-BE.

### Is there an optimal length of psychological treatment for eating disorder pathology? [^115yMDBh]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Treatment guidelines for eating disorders (ED) are unclear about the optimal length of psychological care. We aimed to investigate associations between treatment duration and changes in ED pathology. Data for 164 outpatients accessing psychological interventions for ED were analyzed using MANOVA. We tested associations between number of therapy sessions and pre-post treatment changes in clinical outcomes (EDE-Q global scores, binge eating, purging); adjusting for baseline measures, diagnoses, and treatment type. Secondary analyses included rapid response variables in the above outcomes by treatment session eight. Partial correlations between treatment duration and BMI changes (adjusting for intake BMI) were examined for anorexia nervosa cases. Treatment duration was not significantly associated with changes in ED outcomes after adjusting for rapid response. BMI change (weight regain) was not correlated with treatment duration in anorexia nervosa cases. Rapid response was associated with better EDE-Q outcomes, but not with changes in binge eating or purging behaviors. ED outcomes are unrelated to treatment duration; rapid response is a useful prognostic indicator for treatment planning.

3.3.2.4 Baseline Eating Disorder Severity

Baseline ED severity did not moderate the magnitude of the effect for any outcome (see Table 2). This was consistent in the sensitivity analyses (see Supporting Information).

3.3.2.5 Publication Year

The magnitude of effect sizes was not moderated by publication year for any outcome (see Table 2). This was consistent in the sensitivity analyses (see Supporting Information).

3.3.3 Binge‐Eating Disorder Studies

CBT for BED was associated with lower levels of ED pathology, g = −0.48, 95% CI = [−0.78; −0.18], and a lower binge‐eating frequency, g = −0.50, 95% CI = [−0.77; −0.22], across all types of comparison groups and treatment formats. Heterogeneity was large for both ED pathology, τ = 0.45, 95% PI = [−1.45; 0.49], and binge‐eating frequency, τ = 0.51, 95% PI = [−1.31; 0.32]. The results were consistent in the sensitivity analyses (see Supporting Information).

3.3.3.1 Type of Comparison Group

Type of comparison group did not moderate the magnitude of the effect for ED pathology, Q (2) = 3.16, p = 0.206, or binge‐eating frequency, Q (2) = 1.10, p = 0.576, that is, effect sizes did not differ between types of comparison groups. There was an effect in favor of CBT for both ED pathology and binge‐eating frequency when compared to waitlist (see Table 2). We found no differences for either outcome between CBT and active treatments. In comparison to TAU, CBT was associated with less ED pathology, but not with less binge eating. Residual heterogeneity was high for both ED pathology and binge‐eating frequency (see Table 2).

### Cognitive behavioral therapy for eating disorders: a map of the systematic review evidence base [^111FMGwC]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cognitive behavioral approaches to the understanding and treatment of the eating disorders (EDs) were first developed in the early eighties (Fairburn; Fairburn et al; Garner & Bemis). Since this time, theory and treatment have evolved to focus on the mechanisms proposed to maintain eating disorder psychopathology across the full range of EDs (Cooper & Fairburn; Fairburn et al.). In addition, evidence supporting cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for these disorders has accumulated from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and has been synthesized in a number of systematic reviews (e.g. Bulik, Berkman, Brownley, Sedway, & Lohr, 2007; Hay; Linardon et al.). Further support has come from the use of evidence supported CBT in real world settings (Weissman et al.).

CBT is now recommended by the majority of evidence‐based national guidelines (Hilbert et al.) as the first line of treatment for bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge eating disorder (BED), and to a lesser extent (due to less robust evidence) for the other specified feeding and eating disorders (OSFED) (this DSM‐5 diagnosis partially overlaps with the previously used DSM IV category, "eating disorder not otherwise specified" [EDNOS]). While CBT is clearly regarded as the treatment of choice for these latter disorders that do not involve significantly low weight (Weissman et al.), it is one amongst a number of options for the treatment of adults with anorexia nervosa (AN) (Mulkens & Waller). Three main approaches are currently recommended for the treatment of AN (e.g. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [NICE],) specialist supportive clinical management (SSCM; Carter et al; McIntosh et al; Touyz et al.); the Maudsley model AN treatment for adults (MANTRA; Schmidt et al.) and CBT (CBT‐E; Fairburn et al.).

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with eating disorders [^114bsqBX]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2015). Medium credibility.

Binge eating disorder (BED) — psychotherapy evidence: Treatment of BED in adults has received considerable attention in research studies, and studies in adults suggest that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) are effective. In adolescents with BED, preliminary studies support the use of interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), but BED has otherwise been relatively unexamined in younger patients.

### Cognitive-behavioral therapy for binge-eating disorder for non-responders to initial acute treatments: randomized controlled trial [^111AueDy]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Certain treatments have demonstrated acute efficacy for binge-eating disorder (BED) but many patients who receive "evidence-based" interventions do not derive sufficient benefit. Given the dearth of controlled research examining treatments for patients who fail to respond to initial interventions, this study tested the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for patients with BED who do not respond to initial acute treatments.

Methods

Prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled single-site trial, conducted August 2017-December 2021, tested 16-weeks of therapist-led CBT for non-responders to initial treatment (naltrexone/bupropion and/or behavioral therapy) for BED with obesity. Thirty-one patients (mean age 46.3years, 77.4% women, 80.6% White, mean BMI 38.99kg/m²) who were non-responders to initial acute treatments were randomized to CBT (N = 18) or no-CBT (N = 13), in addition to continuing double-blinded pharmacotherapy. Independent assessments were performed at baseline, throughout treatment, and posttreatment; 83.9% completed posttreatment assessments.

Results

Intention-to-treat remission rates were significantly higher for CBT (61.1%; N = 11/18) than no-CBT (7.7%; N = 1/13). Mixed models of binge-eating frequency (assessed using complementary methods) converged revealing a significant interaction between CBT and time and a significant main effect of CBT. Binge-eating frequency decreased significantly with CBT but did not change significantly with no-CBT. Since only four patients received behavioral treatment during the acute treatments, we performed "sensitivity-type" analyses restricted to the 27 patients who received pharmacotherapy during the acute treatment and found the same pattern of findings for CBT versus no-CBT.

Conclusions

Adult patients with BED who fail to respond to initial pharmacological treatments should be offered CBT.

Public Significance

Even with leading evidence-based treatments for binge-eating disorder, many patients do not derive sufficient benefit. Almost no controlled research has examined treatments for patients who fail to respond to initial interventions. This study found that that cognitive-behavioral therapy was effective for patients with binge-eating disorder who did not respond to initial interventions, with 61% achieving abstinence.

### Recent developments in treatments for eating disorders [^113FV7C5]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Eating disorders, including anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), binge-eating disorder (BED), and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), are serious psychiatric illnesses treated primarily with psychotherapy focusing on eating behaviors. Pharmacotherapy is recommended when psychotherapy is insufficient or unavailable, or when medication treatment is preferred by the patient. Differing psychotherapeutic approaches are used depending on the illness. Family-based treatment has demonstrated utility in adolescents with AN and BN. Eating disorder-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is consistently helpful in individuals with BN and BED. Adaptations of CBT appear promising for the treatment of ARFID. Only two medications have received FDA approval for the treatment of eating disorders - fluoxetine for BN and lisdexamfetamine for BED. Existing treatments are not universally effective, and relapse rates are still elevated among those who do respond to treatment. Psychotherapies such as the habit-interrupting REACH ​+ ​for AN and biological treatments including neuromodulation techniques that target specific brain regions implicated in the development and maintenance of eating disorders warrant further study.

### Biological therapies for eating disorders [^115oR9X9]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide a comprehensive review of pharmacotherapy and other biological treatments for eating disorders.

Method

Literature on this topic was systematically reviewed.

Results

The bulimia nervosa (BN) literature underscores the utility of antidepressants, particularly SSRIs, in improving the symptoms of the disorder. The literature on binge eating disorder supports efficacy on reduction in binge eating frequency for a variety of compounds. However, such compounds have only modest effects on weight. Certain antiepileptic agents such as topiramate, if tolerated, are probably more useful in terms of weight loss. The number of controlled trials in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) in particular has been quite small, and recent meta-analyses show disappointing results using atypical antipsychotics in AN.

Discussion

The pharmacological treatment of eating disorders remains an underdeveloped field although drug therapy clearly plays a role in the treatment of those with BN and binge eating disorder. Other biological therapies have not been adequately studied.

### The three-legged stool of evidence-based practice in eating disorder treatment: research, clinical, and patient perspectives [^1171GX8p]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Although potentially useful in guiding treatment selection, consistent predictors of treatment outcome have not been identified in eating disorders. One notable exception is rapid response in CBT: among individuals with bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder, significant symptomatic reduction in the first month has been associated with better outcome at end of treatment. This robust finding has important clinical implications, especially in the context of stepped care models. More recently, increasing attention has been focused on identifying treatment-specific moderators and mediators that can be used to optimize treatment selection. Preliminary support for several treatment-specific moderators has been found in randomized controlled eating disorder treatment studies. More specifically, adults with severe and enduring anorexia nervosa who were older, classified as binge eating and purging subtype, and with higher levels of depression and global eating disorder psychopathology showed greater improvement in CBT than in specialist supportive clinical management. For adolescents with anorexia nervosa who received FBT or AFT, those with higher baseline levels of eating-related psychopathology and obsessionality benefited more from FBT than AFT at end of treatment. Adolescents with bulimia nervosa who reported higher levels of purging at baseline, as well as those who were younger, showed greater improvement in FBT than in supportive psychotherapy; a previous study also observed that FBT was associated with better outcomes for participants who reported lower scores on global eating disorder psychopathology (e.g. eating, weight, and shape concerns). Additionally, a recent study found that participants with symptoms of bulimia nervosa who reported higher levels of stimulus seeking and affective instability showed more improvement in integrative cognitive-affective therapy than in CBT; individuals lower in stimulus seeking had better treatment outcome in CBT than in integrative cognitive-affective therapy. Another recent study observed that, for participants with both bulimia nervosa and borderline personality disorder, the broad version of CBT-E was associated with better outcome compared to the focused version for those who reported high levels of baseline emotional and interpersonal distress; participants with lower levels of emotional and interpersonal distress reported more improvement with the focused version of CBT. For binge eating disorder, a randomized trial found that those with avoidant personality disorder and early onset overweight and dieting had poorer outcome in an active control condition than in DBT. Overvaluation of shape and weight has also been identified as a treatment moderator in binge eating disorder as it was associated with better outcome in CBT compared to psychopharmacological treatment, even when controlling for negative affect. In the same study, younger patients had better outcome with fluoxetine, whereas higher levels of baseline negative affect and binge eating frequency and lower levels of self-esteem were associated with better outcome in CBT; in addition, older age of onset of binge eating disorder was associated with more rapid improvements in CBT. Another randomized trial for the treatment of binge eating disorder found that higher levels of eating disorder psychopathology and lower self-esteem were associated with better outcome in CBT and IPT compared to CBT-guided self-help. Finally, in a heterogeneous eating disorder sample, participants with lower self-esteem and higher levels of mood intolerance, interpersonal difficulties, and clinical perfectionism showed improved response to the broad version of CBT-E compared to the focused version.

### The efficacy of individual cognitive behavioral therapy for eating disorders: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114GzUfg]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

This meta‐analysis aims to provide an update on the efficacy of individual cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for eating disorders (EDs) in the light of recent advances in the field, particularly the emergence of new approaches like self‐help.

Method

We conducted multivariate multilevel meta‐analyses using data from 42 randomized controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy of individual CBT for anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge‐eating disorder, and mixed eating disorder samples. Outcomes included ED pathology, the frequency of binge eating and compensatory behaviors, and body mass index. The type of comparison group, treatment format, treatment duration, baseline ED severity, and year of publication were analyzed as potential moderators.

Results

CBT was more efficacious with regard to all relevant outcomes than waitlist conditions. For anorexia nervosa, there were no studies using a waitlist condition. CBT was not superior to active treatments for any disorder or any outcome. Therapist‐led treatment for bulimia nervosa showed a significant effect for all outcomes, while self‐help formats only did for some outcomes. Treatment duration and publication year were significant moderators for mixed EDs, while greater baseline severity was associated with larger effects of CBT for binge‐eating disorder.

Discussion

The variety of active controls impeded comparative analyses of CBT with specific active controls. Effects were heterogeneous; the majority of studies had a poor risk of bias assessment. There is a paucity of research, particularly of treatment studies for anorexia nervosa.

### Women's perceptions of weight stigma and experiences of weight-neutral treatment for binge eating disorder: a qualitative study [^114noTFx]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Theme 2: weight stigma affected access to and quality of medical care

Participants reported their experience of having a high body weight as a barrier to accessing care. In particular, participants described feeling dismissed or invalidated in healthcare settings because of their weight. For example, two participants reported instances where physicians declined to accept them as new patients, showing evidence of weight bias:

"It was the first time the doctor met me, and she was like, 'You're overweight; I don't want any more overweight [patients]'. She was just horrible. And she left the room, and I burst into tears".

"He's supposed to be this great weight-loss doctor, and he sort of said, 'thanks but no thanks'… And he basically said he couldn't help me because I had too much of an emotional attachment to food. And I remember sitting in the car crying saying, 'Oh my God, even the 'fat-doctor' rejected me'.

Participants also reported barriers to receiving the individualized healthcare they needed, particularly to address binge eating symptoms, feeling as though there weren't treatment options for their specific behaviors or symptoms. Some described being viewed as "not sick enough" to warrant an evaluation, referral, or treatment of sufficient duration for binge eating due, in part, to having a higher body weight. Both weight bias and a poor understanding of the spectrum of eating disorder diagnoses was evidenced here:

"Binge eating people are an afterthought. There are just not really services for me. That's just how it is".

"I've looked around [for treatment options] and there's just nothing. It's either the inpatient [treatment] for like anorexia or something; there's nothing for severe binge eating disorder".

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with eating disorders [^113Hx8ti]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2015). Medium credibility.

Bulimia nervosa (BN), binge eating disorder (BED), and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) — diagnostic status and treatment evidence: BN was first included in the DSM-III in 1980, and although few adolescent studies exist, many intervention studies of adults with BN have demonstrated the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT); in addition, antidepressant medications and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) are effective in adults with BN. The diagnosis of binge eating disorder (BED) is now included in the DSM-5, is understudied in children and adolescents but appears to be rarer in younger patients than in adults, and effective treatments for adults with BED include both CBT, IPT, and medications, with pilot studies supporting the use of IPT for adolescents with BED. Another new diagnosis in the DSM-5 is ARFID, a disorder found principally in children in which food or eating is avoided, usually leading to low weight, but is not associated with shape or weight concerns, or intentional efforts to reduce weight.

### The efficacy of individual cognitive behavioral therapy for eating disorders: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1169Qzxy]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusion

Our meta‐analysis synthesized treatment studies for individual CBT for adults with EDs over almost four decades of research. In line with previous meta‐analyses, CBT consistently outperformed waitlist comparisons for ED pathology and binge eating and frequency of compensatory behaviors in BN, BED, and mixed disorders, which justifies its role in treatment guidelines. However, other than indicated by Linardon, Wade, et al. CBT did not clearly emerge as more efficacious than active treatments, which were a heterogeneous group of treatments that ranged from unspecific treatments to evidence‐based theory‐driven approaches. Although weight gain is the key treatment goal for AN, BMI was not consistently reported, and descriptively, CBT even showed lower post‐treatment BMI than other active treatments. This represents a crucial area for future research. With regard to different treatment formats, more intensive and guided treatment formats tended to show a more consistent effect than unguided treatment formats. Neither ED severity at baseline nor treatment duration or publication year emerged as consistent moderators of CBT efficacy. However, these findings have to be interpreted cautiously because of methodological limitations, such as potential confounding. Future research should target RCTs investigating specialized treatments for AN, compare CBT for BN to the clinical care as ordinarily practiced, and conduct trials that examine therapist‐led treatments for BED.

### Web-based guided self-help vs treatment as usual for binge-eating disorder: a randomized clinical trial [^113AuUwG]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this randomized clinical trial examining the comparative difference between web-based guided self-help and treatment as usual, the findings suggest that web-based guided self-help can be a viable treatment for adults with BED. The many advantages of this noninferior, scalable, web-based treatment intervention, which requires minimal therapeutic involvement, should be studied further. Based on the positive findings from this study, future work should examine the source of guidance in the guided self-help program. Understanding the comparative differences in who administers guidance, including nonspecialized health care workers and experts by experience, will provide more evidence for the accessibility and scalability of treatment.

### The prevalence of eating disorders and disordered eating in adults seeking obesity treatment: a systematic review with meta-analyses [^117YHv6w]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

3 Results

From 5762 articles screened, 85 studies (k) were included (see Figure 1 for PRISMA flow diagram). Studies were published between 1985 and 2025, with most conducted in the United States (k = 43) and Italy (k = 17). Across all participants (n = 94,295, 75.9% females), median age was 44 years (IQR = 5) and BMI 46 kg/m² (IQR = 10). One study (Leone et al.) reported a median BMI < 30 kg/m². Participants were presenting for bariatric surgery (k = 49), behavioral weight management (k = 9), multiple treatment options (k = 8), low/very low energy diets (k = 3), pharmacotherapy (k = 1), behavioral/psychodynamic rehabilitation (k = 1) or undefined obesity treatments (k = 14). Further study characteristics were summarized in Table S2. Prevalence rates were reported across multiple eating disorders and disordered eating behaviors; see Table 1 for the summary of results grouped by symptomology. Most studies reported on binge‐eating disorder (k = 46), followed by self‐report binge eating (k = 32). The most common assessment method was clinical interview (k = 34), followed by the Binge Eating Scale (Gormally et al.) (k = 21). No studies reported on avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, pica, rumination, or purging disorder. Five studies (Bianciardi, Fabbricatore, et al; Calugi et al; Dalle Grave, Misconel, et al; Dalle Grave, Ruocco, et al; Imperatori et al; Micanti et al.) reported excluding participants based on the presence of eating disorders and/or disordered eating. Of these, three studies (Calugi et al; Dalle Grave, Misconel, et al; Dalle Grave, Ruocco, et al; Micanti et al.) reported the number of participants that were excluded according to these criteria, and data were extracted and included in this review. These data included eating disorder diagnoses of bulimia nervosa and/or low frequency bulimia nervosa, night eating syndrome, and other specified feeding or eating disorders. Two studies (Bianciardi, Fabbricatore, et al; Imperatori et al; Imperatori et al.) excluded participants with purging and non‐purging compensatory behaviors, and the number of participants excluded were not reported. For these studies, data from the Binge Eating Scale data were extracted.

### Binge-eating disorder with and without lifetime anorexia nervosa: a comparison of sociodemographic and clinical features [^114PJ7ah]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare individuals who have experienced binge-eating disorder (BED) and anorexia nervosa (AN) (BED AN+) to those who have experienced BED and not AN (BED AN-).

Method

Participants (N = 898) met criteria for lifetime BED and reported current binge eating. Approximately 14% had a lifetime diagnosis of AN. Analyses compared BED AN+ and BED AN- on sociodemographic variables and clinical history.

Results

The presence of lifetime AN was associated with more severe eating disorder symptoms, including earlier onset, more frequent, more chronic, and more types of eating disorder behaviors over the lifetime, as well as a higher lifetime prevalence of bulimia nervosa (BN). Participants with lifetime AN reported being more likely to have received treatments for BED or BN, had significantly lower minimum, current, and maximum BMIs, had more severe general anxiety, and were significantly more likely to be younger and female. In the full sample, the lifetime prevalence of unhealthy weight control behaviors was high and treatment utilization was low, despite an average 15-year history since symptom onset. Gastrointestinal disorders and comorbid anxiety, depression, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms were prevalent.

Discussion

Individuals fared poorly on a wide array of domains, yet those with lifetime AN fared considerably more poorly. All patients with BED should be screened for mental health and gastrointestinal comorbidities and offered referral and treatment options.

Public Significance

Individuals experiencing binge-eating disorder have severe symptomology, but those who have experienced binge-eating disorder and anorexia nervosa fare even more poorly. Our study emphasizes that patients with binge-eating disorder would benefit from being screened for mental health and gastrointestinal comorbidities, and clinicians should consider history of unhealthy weight control behaviors to inform treatment and relapse prevention.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with eating disorders [^114vixAT]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2015). Medium credibility.

Binge eating disorder (BED) — etiology and risk factors emphasize limited youth-specific evidence and common onset patterns. Comparatively little is known about specific risk factors for BED in children and adolescents, and onset of binge eating typically begins in late adolescence or early adulthood, often after significant dieting or weight loss. Reported correlates include restrictive dieting, pressure to be thin, body dissatisfaction, emotional eating, low self‑esteem, poor social support, and increased eating related to specific psychopathology, depressed mood, and increased anxiety associated with initiation of adolescent binge eating.

Clinical characteristics of binge-eating disorder versus obesity

BED was first recognised as a discrete eating disorder in the American Psychiatric Association (APA): Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Edition 5 (: DSM-V); its symptoms are defined under five criteria:

Criterion 1: Recurrent episodes of binge eating (BE). BE episodes are characterised by eating an excessive amount of food in a discrete period combined with a sense of lack of control.
Criterion 2: BE episodes are associated with three (or more) of: Eating much more rapidly than normal. Eating until feeling uncomfortably full. Eating large amounts of food when not hungry. Eating alone because of embarrassment over how much is eaten. Feeling disgusted, depressed or very guilty after overeating.
Criterion 3: Marked distress regarding BE.
Criterion 4: BE occurs ⩾1 day/week for 3 months (: DSM-V).
Criterion 5: BE is not associated with the regular use of inappropriate compensatory behaviour (e.g. purging, fasting and excessive exercise) and does not occur exclusively during the course of AN or BN.

### The project COMPASS protocol: optimizing mindfulness and acceptance-based behavioral treatment for binge-eating spectrum disorders [^1178R3AC]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Outcomes from cognitive behavioral therapy for binge-eating spectrum disorders are suboptimal, possibly due in part to deficits in self-regulation (i.e., the ability to control behavior in pursuit of long-term goals despite internal challenges). Mindfulness and acceptance-based treatments (MABTs) integrate behavioral treatment with psychological strategies designed to enhance self-regulation, yet little is known about how and for whom they are effective. The present study will utilize the multiphase optimization strategy to identify which of four MABT components (mindful awareness, distress tolerance, emotion modulation, values-based decision making) to include in a fully powered clinical trial. Participants (n = 256) will be randomized to 16 sessions in one of 16 conditions, each a different combination of MABT components being included or excluded from a base behavioral treatment. Our primary aim is to evaluate each component's independent efficacy on disordered eating symptoms. Our secondary aims are to confirm each component's target engagement (i.e., whether each component improves the targeted variable and outcomes), and test that each component's efficacy is moderated by baseline weaknesses in the same component (e.g., that participants with poor distress tolerance at baseline benefit most from the distress tolerance component). Our exploratory aim is to quantify the component interaction effects.

### A randomized comparison of long acting methylphenidate and cognitive behavioral therapy in the treatment of binge eating disorder [^116Uv6PX]. Psychiatry Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a well-established treatment for binge eating disorder (BED); however, this treatment is underutilized, highlighting the need for additional treatment alternatives. Dopamine neurotransmission has been associated with dysregulated eating, and pharmaceutical agents targeting the dopamine system are associated with decreased binge eating and weight. The primary objective of the current investigation was to evaluate the efficacy of psychostimulant medication versus current best practices in the treatment of BED symptoms, in a randomized trial of methylphenidate versus CBT for BED. The secondary objective was to evaluate the ability of impulsivity to predict treatment outcomes. Female outpatients with BED were randomized to receive methylphenidate (n = 22) or CBT (n = 27) for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was objective binge episode frequency; secondary outcomes included subjective binge episode frequency, body mass index (BMI), BED symptoms, and quality of life. Results showed that both treatments had a significant impact on primary and secondary outcomes. Methylphenidate and CBT were associated with decreases in subjective and objective binge episodes; methylphenidate was associated with greater decreases in BMI. Two impulsivity traits predicted clinical outcomes. Results provide preliminary support for the therapeutic benefit of methylphenidate in BED treatment, and prognostic utility of impulsivity in this context.

### Screening for eating disorders in adolescents and adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116gUBQv]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Treatment or interventions for eating disorders — clinical care describes that persons suspected of having an eating disorder are typically referred to specialists for diagnostic evaluations and treatment, and treatment for eating disorders in symptomatic persons generally involves an interdisciplinary approach encompassing psychological/behavioral, medical, and nutritional components. Psychological approaches include cognitive behavioral therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, and dialectical behavior therapy. Two medications have US Food and Drug Administration approval for treatment of an eating disorder: lisdexamfetamine for binge eating disorder treatment, and fluoxetine for bulimia nervosa treatment. Other psychotropic medications are used to treat eating disorder symptoms as well as comorbid psychiatric conditions but are not always indicated, and medical management focuses on addressing physical and medical complications of eating disorders such as cardiac instability, musculoskeletal injury, and endocrine function.

### Prospects for new drugs to treat binge-eating disorder: insights from psychopathology and neuropharmacology [^114oMXCi]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

The severity rating of BED is defined in APA: DSM-V as ranging from Mild (1–3 episodes/week) to Extreme (⩾14 episodes/week).

It is important to emphasise that none of the BED diagnostic criteria refer to weight, the metabolic sequelae of obesity, or its risk factors. The inference is the effectiveness of BED treatments is based exclusively on enabling the patient to regain self-control, reduce the impulsive, compulsive and perseverative drive to binge-eat and decrease the frequency and severity of BE episodes.

BED is the most common eating disorder with a lifetime prevalence rate in the young > 1% compared with 0.3% for AN and ~1% for BN. A more recent meta-analysis estimated the lifetime prevalence of BED at 2.22% compared with 0.21% and 0.81% for AN and BN, respectively. An analysis of BED and BN rates across 14 countries, which included those with different average income levels, produced similar lifetime prevalence rates of 1.9% and 1.0%, respectively, with no difference due to income classification. BED is slightly more common in females than males. With ~40% comorbidity between the two disorders, BED is strongly associated with obesity and BED in adolescence predicts the development of obesity with an odds ratio (OR) = 3.58. Nonetheless, a significant proportion (17%–30%) of BED sufferers have normal body weights (body mass index (BMI) 18.0–25 kg/m²), and according toand, the majority (~60%) are in the normal weight/overweight categories (BMI 18.5–29.9 kg/m²). Evidence that BED is a causal factor in extreme obesity comes from the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery-2 (LABS-2) before/after surgery (. Of 2266 severely obese subjects, 15.7% subjects satisfied the criteria for BED, 17.7% for night eating syndrome, but only 2% for BN.

### Prospects for new drugs to treat binge-eating disorder: insights from psychopathology and neuropharmacology [^113b5JWM]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

BED has a strong association and comorbidity with other psychiatric conditions. Obese BED subjects have greater concerns about their appearance and body weight and exhibit greater body dissatisfaction than those without BED. There is also an association between BED and anxiety or substance use disorders.reported that taking medication for psychiatric or emotional problems, having symptoms of alcohol use disorder, lower self-esteem and greater depressive symptoms were among the factors that independently increased the odds of BED. In addition to psychiatric disorders, BED is independently associated with an increased risk of physical comorbidities including back/neck pain, chronic headaches and other types of chronic pain, as well as the cardiometabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes and hypertension, but not heart attacks or strokes.

The primary endpoint in BED trials is a reduction in the frequency of binge episodes. Although most patients in these trials are obese because of the severity of their BED, subjects are enrolled exclusively on a confirmed BED diagnosis generally with BMI inclusion criteria of ⩾18 to ≤ 45. Consistent with the focus on BE episode frequency, decreased appetite and weight loss are treated as part of the safety and tolerability assessment, not as indices of clinical benefit.

In contrast to BED, the diagnosis and treatment of obesity focuses on weight, adiposity and a reduction of risk factors for cardiometabolic disease and cancer. The primary efficacy endpoint for new anti-obesity drugs is a decrease in body weight (absolute and/or categorical analyses), and an important secondary measure is a reduction in waist circumference or waist/hip ratio. The key assumption is a reduction in weight and visceral adiposity translate into a decreased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, and suffering strokes, heart attacks and some cancers, while simultaneously, directly treating comorbidities like osteoarthritis of the knee and sleep apnoea. The objective of the therapeutic intervention is to reduce the disease burden and ultimately to increase patients' life expectancy and quality of life. Since none of the approved drugs alters metabolic rate, weight reduction is solely driven by reduced food consumption that is decreased appetite or increased satiety. What is absent from these primary and secondary outcome measures are items to explore effects on abnormal eating patterns or eating disorders, for example BED, night-time eating or BN. The reason is simple. It is because anti-obesity drugs were not designed or developed with a view to producing weight loss in patients with eating disorders by treating the underpinning psychopathology of their conditions.

### Psychological treatments of binge eating disorder… [^113fnsZS]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Figure 1. Participant flow across all phases of the study. BWL indicates behavioral weight loss treatment; CBTgsh, guided self-help based on cognitive behavior therapy; and IPT, interpersonal psychotherapy. Figure 2. Remission rates at posttreatment and 1- and 2-year follow-up. BWL indicates behavioral weight loss treatment; CBTgsh, guided self-help based on cognitive behavior therapy; and IPT, interpersonal psychotherapy. Interpersonal psychotherapy is an effective specialty treatment for binge eating disorder. Behavioral weight loss treatment and guided self-help based on cognitive behavior therapy have both resulted in short-term reductions in binge eating in obese patients with BED. Objective To test whether patients with BED require specialty therapy beyond BWL and whether IPT is more effective than either BWL or CBTgsh in patients with a high negative affect during a 2-year follow-up.

Conclusions Interpersonal psychotherapy and CBTgsh are significantly more effective than BWL in eliminating binge eating after 2 years. Guided self-help based on cognitive behavior therapy is a first-line treatment option for most patients with BED, with IPT used for patients with low self-esteem and high eating disorder psychopathology. Cognitive behavior therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy are specialty therapies for BED that directly target the eating disorder. Well-controlled studies have demonstrated that these therapies are reliably effective in eliminating binge eating and reducing associated psychopathology in the short- and longer-term, but do not on average produce clinically significant weight loss. 7, 8 Behavioral weight loss treatment is widely used to treat obesity, including binge eating, via moderate caloric restriction, improved nutrition, and increased physical activity.
9.

Early studies comparing BWL with specialty CBT in the treatment of BED indicated comparable effects on binge eating in the short-term, 10, 11 but long-term evaluations were lacking. Guided self-help based on cognitive behavior therapy is designed to eliminate binge eating. The promising results of early research15, 16 have been supported by more recent studies17, 18 showing that CBTgsh is effective in the short-term in reducing binge eating. As a brief intervention that can be used by nonspecialist health providers, 19 CBTgsh is cost-effective, an appealing option when specialty treatment is unavailable, and suitable as a first treatment in a stepped-care program. 20.
