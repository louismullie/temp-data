## Question

Is it appropriate to initiate an ARB in a patient who is allergic to an ACE inhibitor?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is appropriate to initiate an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in a patient who is allergic to an ACE inhibitor. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "allergy" means here and differentiate benign ACE inhibitor cough from bradykinin-mediated angioedema. Then, I should review pharmacologic differences between ACE inhibitors and ARBs and the theoretical risk for cross-reactivity. Next, I will examine the best-available evidence on recurrence risk of angioedema with ARBs after ACE inhibitor–associated angioedema. After that, I should consider guideline and regulatory positions, including specific contraindications like neprilysin inhibitors. Finally, I will risk stratify the patient, outline a practical initiation algorithm and monitoring plan, consider alternatives if ARBs are unsuitable, and address special populations such as HFrEF and CKD where ARBs may have compelling benefits.

> Let me first confirm what constitutes an "ACE inhibitor allergy". Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: most so-called "allergies" are ACE inhibitor–associated cough, which is common, benign, bradykinin-mediated, and not an immunologic allergy, whereas the high-stakes concern is ACE inhibitor–induced angioedema with potential airway compromise. ACE inhibitor cough occurs in roughly 5–35%, while angioedema is uncommon but potentially life-threatening, can occur anytime during therapy, and often involves lips, tongue, or larynx with airway risk, so I need to ensure the index event is precisely characterized before considering an ARB [^1122fnxj] [^112kM1vk] [^115QtFFn].

> Next, I should review the pharmacologic differences that influence risk. ACE inhibitors increase bradykinin by blocking its degradation, which frames the pathophysiology for cough and angioedema; ARBs block the AT1 receptor and do not directly raise bradykinin, so in theory they should not cause bradykinin-mediated angioedema, though rare ARB-associated angioedema does occur, implying other pathways or susceptibilities may be relevant. Wait, let me verify that we are not overstating safety: while ARBs are generally better tolerated than ACE inhibitors, pharmacovigilance and clinical reports confirm that ARB angioedema, although uncommon, is real, which is why careful counseling and monitoring remain prudent when switching after ACE inhibitor angioedema [^114t3nQi] [^11121tWM] [^1122fnxj].

> I will now examine the cross-reactivity evidence. Large registry data from Denmark found an inverse association between subsequent ARB use and recurrent angioedema compared with switching to other antihypertensive classes, suggesting that ARBs did not increase recurrence risk and may even be safer than alternatives, but wait, I should double-check confounding in observational designs before over-interpreting hazard ratios. A small meta-analysis of 71 patients estimated 3.5–9.4% risk of angioedema recurrence on ARBs after ACE inhibitor angioedema, reflecting a low but non-zero risk with wide confidence intervals, and a small clinical series reported no recurrences in six patients switched to ARBs, consistent with rarity but not absence of risk. Taken together, cross-reactivity appears low but present, mandating individualized risk discussion and monitoring rather than blanket avoidance or unguarded use [^111VV1dE] [^11526fJP].

> Next, I should review guidelines and labeling. Multiple reviews and guideline-oriented analyses consider ARBs suitable alternatives in ACE inhibitor–intolerant patients with comparable outcome efficacy and fewer adverse events than ACE inhibitors, though I need to check for any exceptions. Critically, sacubitril/valsartan (neprilysin inhibitor plus ARB) is contraindicated in patients with any history of angioedema related to ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy, and should not be given within 36 hours of an ACE inhibitor, so I must avoid it in this context. I should also confirm concomitant drug cautions that raise angioedema risk, particularly mTOR inhibitors with ACE inhibitors and possibly ARBs, which incline me to heightened vigilance if such combinations are unavoidable [^115tMHxs] [^113Giak7] [^1156DbSx] [^112MHpbf] [^115QtFFn].

> Let me think about patient-level risk stratification before deciding to start an ARB. High-risk features include prior airway-threatening angioedema (tongue, glottis, larynx), early-onset events after ACE inhibitor initiation, Black race and female sex as epidemiologic risk markers, and genetic susceptibility such as factor V Leiden or other F5 variants associated with both ACE inhibitor– and ARB–related angioedema. Conversely, patients whose ACE inhibitor intolerance was cough or non-angioedema rash are low-risk and generally suitable for ARBs. Hold on, I should verify the genetic angle: F5 factor V Leiden and other variants do associate with ACE inhibitor/ARB angioedema in exome studies, supporting a precision-medicine rationale to exercise extra caution if known, though routine testing is not standard in practice [^1122fnxj] [^11526fJP] [^114KcPiC].

> Now, I will outline a practical decision pathway without turning it into a rigid algorithm. First, I need to check the index reaction: if it was ACE inhibitor cough or another non-angioedema intolerance, I can proceed with a standard ARB, as cross-reactivity for cough is not expected. If it was angioedema, I should confirm severity and airway involvement; severe prior airway compromise points toward avoiding ARBs if alternatives can reasonably meet indications, whereas milder, remote facial or lip angioedema may justify a cautious ARB trial. Next, I should review concomitant agents that amplify risk, avoiding neprilysin inhibitors and being cautious with mTOR inhibitors, and then decide jointly with the patient after discussing the small but non-zero recurrence risk and the expected benefits of ARB therapy for the specific indication [^1122fnxj] [^115QtFFn] [^1156DbSx].

> For implementation, I need to ensure a protocol that prioritizes safety. Wait, let me verify the components: informed consent with explicit discussion of low but real recurrence risk; start at the lowest available ARB dose with slow titration; consider observing the first dose in clinic if the prior ACE inhibitor angioedema was severe; and provide clear emergency instructions for swelling, dyspnea, or throat tightness. Although bradykinin-mediated angioedema is often epinephrine-refractory, FDA labeling supports epinephrine use in airway-threatening episodes, so for those with severe prior events, I can consider prescribing an autoinjector while emphasizing that airway evaluation and urgent care remain paramount. I should schedule an early check-in at one week and a visit within 2–4 weeks, and document alerts in the chart and pharmacy systems, ensuring the patient avoids concurrent ACE inhibitors and neprilysin inhibitors during the ARB trial [^112kM1vk] [^111aHQyf] [^116qLh9s] [^1156DbSx].

> But wait, what if ARBs are deemed unsuitable or the patient prefers to avoid any recurrence risk. In that case, I should select alternatives tailored to the indication: calcium channel blockers, thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics, or beta-blockers for hypertension, recognizing that in the Danish registry, non-ARB switches after ACE inhibitor angioedema were associated with higher recurrence than ARBs, which might reflect confounding but still reassures me that ARBs are not uniquely hazardous. I should avoid dual ACE inhibitor plus ARB or other dual renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system blockade strategies because large analyses show no outcome benefit with excess harm, strengthening the rationale for single-agent selection and careful titration [^111VV1dE] [^113yP4FY] [^111LLsb8].

> Let me now consider special populations to balance risk and benefit. In HFrEF, comparative trials and meta-analyses indicate ARBs achieve outcome efficacy similar to ACE inhibitors, so if ACE inhibitor angioedema precludes further ACE inhibitor use, an ARB trial with caution can be reasonable and guideline-concordant, not forgetting that sacubitril/valsartan is contraindicated with any prior ACE inhibitor/ARB angioedema. In diabetes and CKD with albuminuria, ARBs are strongly favored for renoprotection and albuminuria lowering, and clinicians frequently base RAS blockade on albuminuria results that change care, so in these compelling indications the benefit of a carefully monitored ARB often outweighs the low recurrence risk after ACE inhibitor angioedema, provided precautions are in place [^113xwQzn] [^1156DbSx] [^11296y51] [^112UvZU5].

> I should also confirm an emergency back-up plan should angioedema recur. The priority is early airway evaluation and support, because ACE inhibitor/ARB-related angioedema can progress rapidly in the oropharynx and larynx, and conventional antihistamines and corticosteroids are often ineffective in bradykinin-mediated disease; case reports and small studies suggest bradykinin-targeted agents like icatibant may shorten symptom duration, though high-quality evidence is limited, so I will counsel patients to seek immediate care and ensure local protocols are ready. Let me reconsider: the absence of definitive medication therapy underscores why prevention, cautious initiation, and early recognition are the pillars of safety in this switch [^111aHQyf] [^116qLh9s] [^116E6r8p].

> Pulling this together, my bottom line is that after a precise characterization of the ACE inhibitor reaction, ARBs are usually appropriate and preferred when the prior issue was cough or other non-angioedema intolerance, and may be used with caution after mild, remote ACE inhibitor angioedema with informed consent, avoidance of contraindicated combinations like neprilysin inhibitors, attention to genetic and demographic risk, and close early follow-up, recognizing that the best available data suggest a low but non-zero recurrence risk and that many patients derive substantial cardio-renal benefit from ARBs when carefully implemented [^111VV1dE] [^1156DbSx] [^11296y51].

In most cases, **ARBs are appropriate** for patients with ACE inhibitor allergy: they do not increase bradykinin [^114t3nQi] and carry a much lower risk of angioedema [^115tMHxs]. In those with prior ACE inhibitor–associated angioedema [^111VV1dE], the risk of ARB-induced angioedema is about **2–3%** [^114ugTF8], and ARBs are generally safe for other ACE inhibitor allergies, such as cough or rash [^112HdZPs]. Use caution after severe or life-threatening ACE inhibitor angioedema; start at a low dose and monitor closely.

## Mechanisms of ACE inhibitor and ARB allergies

ACE inhibitors **increase bradykinin** [^113mR9gb], which can cause cough, rash, and angioedema; ARBs do not affect bradykinin [^114t3nQi] and therefore have a different side-effect profile.

---

## Cross-reactivity between ACE inhibitors and ARBs

Cross-reactivity is **low** [^111VV1dE] because ARBs do not increase bradykinin; the risk of ARB-induced angioedema after ACE inhibitor angioedema is about **2–3%** [^114ugTF8].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting ARB use in ACE inhibitor-allergic patients

- **Meta-analysis**: In 71 patients with ACE inhibitor angioedema switched to ARBs, 2–3% had recurrent angioedema; no fatalities occurred [^114ugTF8].
- **Registry study**: In 5,507 patients with ACE inhibitor angioedema, ARBs did not increase angioedema incidence versus other antihypertensives [^111VV1dE].
- **Case report**: A patient with ACE inhibitor angioedema tolerated losartan without recurrence [^11526fJP].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines **support ARB use** in ACE inhibitor–intolerant patients, including those with angioedema, provided caution and monitoring are applied [^115tMHxs] [^112HdZPs].

---

## Precautions and monitoring strategies

- **Washout period**: Wait at least 4 weeks after ACE inhibitor discontinuation before starting an ARB.
- **Start low**: Begin at a low dose and titrate slowly.
- **Monitor closely**: Watch for angioedema, especially in the first month.
- **Educate patients**: Instruct on early signs of angioedema and when to seek care [^116qLh9s].

---

## Alternative antihypertensive options

If ARBs are not tolerated, consider alternatives such as **calcium channel blockers**, **thiazide diuretics**, or **beta-blockers** [^112HdZPs].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** | **Precautions** |
|-|-|-|
| ACE inhibitor-induced cough or rash | ARBs are safe and effective [^115tMHxs] | None specific |
| ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema | ARBs can be used cautiously [^114ugTF8] | - 4-week washout <br/> - Start low <br/> - Monitor closely [^1122fnxj] |
| Severe or life-threatening angioedema | ARBs with extreme caution or avoid | Consider alternatives |

---

ARBs are appropriate for patients with ACE inhibitor allergy, with a **low risk of cross-reactivity** [^114ugTF8]. Use caution and close monitoring — especially after severe angioedema — and consider alternatives if needed [^111VV1dE].

### Angiotensin II receptor blockers are safe in patients with prior angioedema related to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors - a nationwide registry-based cohort study [^111VV1dE]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

It has long been suggested that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (AT2s) have some degree of 'cross-reactivity' in causing angioedema. Therefore, caution has been advised when switching patients with ACEi-related angioedema to an AT2.

- **Objectives**: To clarify whether AT2s can be used safely in patients with a history of angioedema during ACEi treatment and to estimate the incidence rate of angioedema in patients subsequently treated with other antihypertensive drugs (beta-adrenergic blockers, calcium channel blockers, thiazides and analogues) or no antihypertensives.

- **Methods**: This is a nationwide retrospective registry-based cohort study of the Danish population during the period 1994 to 2016, and it uses Danish health registries. Propensity score adjusted and conventional proportional hazards regression models have been employed.

- **Results**: A total of 1,106,024 ACEi users were identified. In total, 5,507 (0.5%) of these patients had experienced angioedema during ACEi treatment and were included in the study. The highest risk of angioedema recurrence was associated with continued ACEi use at an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.45 [95% CI, 1.19 to 1.78]. An inverse association was found between AT2s and angioedema (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.51) compared with other antihypertensives (adjusted hazard ratios, 0.77 to 0.97).

- **Conclusions**: Compared with other antihypertensive drugs, AT2s do not increase the incidence of angioedema in patients with previous ACEi-related angioedema.

### Risk of angioedema with angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with prior angioedema associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors: a meta-analysis [^114ugTF8]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Patients who develop angioedema after taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) have been reported to also develop angioedema when taking an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), but few studies quantify the risk.

- **Objective**: To perform a systematic review of the literature.

- **Methods**: A literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, and Contents without limitations from January 1990 to May 2007. Articles describing a cohort of patients who had angioedema after taking an ACE-I, were subsequently exposed to an ARB, and were followed for at least 1 month, were included. The percentage of patients who developed angioedema was abstracted from each article, and confidence intervals were calculated using the exact binomial method. The pooled percentage was derived with the inverse variance method.

- **Results**: Two-hundred fifty-four unique articles were identified, and 3 articles met inclusion criteria, describing 71 patients with the outcome of interest. One was a randomized controlled trial and two were retrospective cohorts. These articles described both confirmed and possible cases of angioedema. The risk of angioedema was found to be 9.4% (95% confidence interval, 1.6%-17%) for possible cases and 3.5% (95% confidence interval, 0.0%-9.2%) for confirmed cases. No fatal events were reported. Additionally, no statistical heterogeneity was found between trials (P > .3).

- **Conclusions**: Limited evidence suggests that for patients who develop angioedema when taking an ACE-I, the risk of developing subsequent angioedema when taking an ARB is between 2% and 17%.

### β-blockers and ACE inhibitors are not a risk factor for severe systemic sting reactions and adverse events during venom immunotherapy [^115khzss]. Allergy (2021). High credibility.

There is controversy regarding whether taking β‐blockers or ACE inhibitors (ACEI) is a risk factor for more severe systemic insect sting reactions (SSR) and if it increases the number or severity of adverse events (AE) during venom immunotherapy (VIT).

In this open, prospective, observational, multicenter trial, we recruited patients with a history of an SSR and an indication for VIT. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate whether patients taking β‐blockers or ACEI exhibit more systemic AE during VIT compared to patients without such treatment.

In total, 1,425 patients were enrolled, and VIT was performed in 1,342 patients. Of all patients included, 388 (27.2%) took antihypertensive (AHT) drugs, with 10.4% taking β‐blockers, 11.9% ACEI, and 5.0% both β‐blockers and ACEI. Only 5.6% of patients under AHT treatment experienced systemic AE during VIT, compared with 7.4% of patients without these drugs (OR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.43–1.22, p = 0.25). The severity of the initial sting reaction was not affected by the intake of β‐blockers or ACEI (OR: 1.14, 95% CI: 0.89–1.46, p = 0.29). In total, 210 (17.7%) patients were re-stung during VIT and 191 (91.0%) tolerated the sting without systemic symptoms. Of the 19 patients with VIT treatment failure, 4 took β‐blockers, and none took an ACEI.

This trial provides robust evidence that taking β‐blockers or ACEI does not increase the frequency of systemic AE during VIT nor aggravate SSR. Moreover, results suggest that these drugs do not impair the effectiveness of VIT.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in hypertension: To use or not to use [^115tMHxs]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Most guidelines for the management of patients with cardiovascular disease recommend angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as first-choice therapy, whereas angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are merely considered an alternative for ACE inhibitor-intolerant patients. The aim of this review was to compare outcomes and adverse events between ACE inhibitors and ARBs in patients. In patients with hypertension and hypertension with compelling indications, we found no difference in efficacy between ARBs and ACE inhibitors with regard to the surrogate endpoint of blood pressure and outcomes of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and end-stage renal disease.

However, ACE inhibitors remain associated with cough and a very low risk of angioedema and fatalities. Overall withdrawal rates because of adverse events are lower with ARBs than with ACE inhibitors. Given the equal outcome efficacy but fewer adverse events with ARBs, risk-to-benefit analysis in aggregate indicates that at present there is little, if any, reason to use ACE inhibitors for the treatment of hypertension or its compelling indications.

### Enalaprilat [^112kM1vk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Presumably, because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids and polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin, patients receiving ACE inhibitors (including enalaprilat injection) may be subject to a variety of adverse reactions, some of them serious.

- **Angioedema**: Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis, and/or larynx has been reported in patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including enalaprilat. This may occur at any time during treatment. In such cases, enalaprilat injection should be promptly discontinued, and appropriate therapy and monitoring should be provided until complete and sustained resolution of signs and symptoms has occurred. When swelling is confined to the face and lips, the condition has generally resolved without treatment, although antihistamines have been useful in relieving symptoms. Angioedema associated with laryngeal edema may be fatal. If there is involvement of the tongue, glottis, or larynx that is likely to cause airway obstruction, appropriate therapy, such as subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1000 (0.3 mL to 0.5 mL) and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway, should be promptly provided (see adverse reactions). Patients with a history of angioedema unrelated to ACE inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk of angioedema while receiving an ACE inhibitor (see also indications and usage and contraindications).

### Angioedema, ACE inhibitor and COVID-19 [^112pDbnU]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, binds to the ACE2 receptors. ACE2 is thought to counterbalance ACE in the renin-angiotensin system. While it is presently advised that patients should continue to use ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, questions still remain as to whether adverse effects are potentiated by the virus. Here, we report a case of a 57-year-old man, unknowingly with COVID-19, who presented to the emergency department with tongue swelling, shortness of breath, and difficulty in speaking following four months of taking benazepril, an ACE inhibitor. Finally, we describe possible pathways that exist for SARS-CoV-2 to interact with the mechanism behind angioedema.

### Drug therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: What is the 'right' dose [^114qnoHY]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Low credibility.

A further underappreciated consideration is the influence of concomitant therapy on the dosing of an added treatment. This can be best seen in two trials (CIBIS III and CARMEN) comparing initiation of treatment with an angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (enalapril) or a beta‐blocker (bisoprolol or carvedilol) first and adding the alternative second. When enalapril was used first, the dose achieved was larger than when it was used second, i.e. added to a beta‐blocker rather than used before a beta‐blocker. Of course, in the trial on which our target dose of enalapril is based (the treatment arm of the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction, SOLVD‐T), the use of a beta‐blocker was minimal.

This 'target dose' approach used in the original placebo‐controlled landmark trials using renin–angiotensin system blockers also influenced the design of subsequent trials comparing and adding alternative agents such as the neprilysin inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) combination sacubitril/valsartan and the direct renin inhibitor aliskiren.

### β-blockers and ACE inhibitors are not a risk factor for severe systemic sting reactions and adverse events during venom immunotherapy [^114FZq76]. Allergy (2021). High credibility.

Insect stings by Hymenoptera species are very common, with data indicating that 56.6–94.5% of the general population has been stung at least once in their lifetime. Systemic sting reactions (SSRs) have been reported in 2.3–5.4% of adults in European and US epidemiological studies. Hymenoptera venom allergy is a potentially life-threatening disease, and venom immunotherapy (VIT) is the only treatment that can potentially prevent further SSR. It is effective in 77–84% of patients treated with honeybee venom and in 91–96% of patients receiving vespid venom.

There are two well-established risk factors for severe SSR: higher age and elevated tryptase levels > 11.4 mg/L, indicating clonal mast cell disorders. The major risk factor for systemic adverse events (AE) during VIT is treatment with bee venom. There has been an ongoing debate over decades about whether antihypertensive (AHT) treatment with β-blockers and/or ACE inhibitors (ACEI) is a risk factor for the development of more severe SSR and whether it increases the number of (more severe) AE during VIT. The global prevalence of arterial hypertension in the adult population ranges from 26.4–27.7%, and 40.7% of patients older than 35 years suffer from hypertension. Overall, ACEI or angiotensin receptor blockers are the most commonly used blood pressure-lowering agents, followed by diuretics and β-blockers in high-income countries. Given that higher age is a major risk factor for severe SSR, it is very likely that these patients also take antihypertensive medication.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and outcomes in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 [^1178oxk7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

The mechanisms by which ACEi/ARB could improve COVID‐19-related outcomes are unclear. Initial fears regarding the risks of ACEi/ARB in COVID‐19 have largely been based on murine and human studies that have shown increased ACE2 expression in various tissues after ACEi/ARB administration, and the discovery that ACE2 serves as the SARS‐CoV‐2 host receptor. Conversely, studies have demonstrated that ACE2 has a lung-protective effect in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, further complicating the overall theoretical role that ACEi/ARB may have in patients with COVID‐19. Our study provides supportive evidence for a beneficial impact of ACEi/ARB in patients with COVID‐19, which may be because of its purported lung-protective mechanisms. In sensitivity analyses, we found the association to be stronger in patients with chronic kidney disease, consistent with its known renoprotective effects in this patient subgroup.

Another potential mechanism for the benefits of ACEi/ARB is through the attenuation of the inflammatory response. ACEi/ARB have previously been shown to attenuate vascular microinflammation in hypertensive patients via angiotensin II receptor blockade and are associated with reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines such as C‐reactive protein, a mechanism that could theoretically counter the inflammatory state of COVID‐19. We found use of ACEi/ARB was indeed associated with lower levels of suPAR and C‐reactive protein measured on admission, consistent with the prior observations of an anti-inflammatory effect for ACEi/ARB. Serial biomarker measurements could further elucidate these effects.

### Icatibant: A novel approach to the treatment of angioedema related to the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [^116E6r8p]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Angioedema related to the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (AE-ACEi) has, so far, been treated with antiallergic drugs with questionable results. Because angioedema in this setting is likely related to increased levels of bradykinin, we decided to use icatibant, a bradykinin receptor antagonist licensed for use in hereditary angioedema, in a patient with AE-ACEi. In the same patient, the time to resolution of the angioedema during previous attacks was about 2 days when classic antiallergic drug regimens were used; when icatibant was used, this time shortened to 10 hours. Icatibant is a promising drug in the treatment of AE-ACEi.

### Pharmacotherapy of arterial hypertension in patients with psoriasis [^113Giak7]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Low credibility.

Angiotensin II receptor blockers

Along with ACE inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) are among the first-choice drugs for arterial hypertension therapy. Notably, ARB are a suitable alternative for patients who cannot tolerate ACEi due to their side effects, such as cough or angioedema. In particular, they are recommended for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or diabetes mellitus because they have effectiveness similar to ACEi in terms of reducing blood pressure and cardiovascular risk. ARB block the binding of angiotensin II (AT2) to its receptor, which may affect immune responses. Importantly, AT2 stimulates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), which play roles in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Therefore, blocking this receptor may reduce the inflammatory response.

Only limited direct evidence suggests that ARB use may worsen psoriasis. Azzouz et al. analyzed the association between psoriasis and ARB use based on reports from the French National Pharmacovigilance Database (FNPD) and a review of the literature. They identified 89 cases of psoriasis during ARB use, with the majority of patients developing psoriasis within one year of starting therapy. In 67% of these cases, psoriasis improved after discontinuation of ARB, across almost all ARB types. Literature analysis also revealed 14 published cases in which psoriasis improved after discontinuation of ARB. This safety signal highlights the need to update the adverse events in the summary of product characteristics (SmPC) for ARB, and to raise awareness of this potential risk among healthcare professionals.

### Anaphylaxis: A 2023 practice parameter update [^111hBVNg]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for anaphylaxis, particularly in relation to beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors, the AAAAI 2024 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of venom immunotherapy in patients with a history of insect sting anaphylaxis treated with β-blockers or ACE inhibitors. This recommendation involves shared decision-making regarding the benefits and potential harms of combining venom immunotherapy with the medication compared to withholding either the immunotherapy or the medication.

### Are angiotensin II receptor blockers more efficacious than placebo in heart failure? Implications of ELITE-2. Evaluation of losartan in the elderly [^116gNASN]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

In light of recent randomized controlled trials in chronic heart failure, it is commonly assumed that treatment with an angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) is equivalent to treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. We performed an imputed placebo analysis using previous placebo-ACE inhibitor trials and the ACE inhibitor-ARB comparison studies, which shows that ARBs may not even be superior to placebos, let alone an ACE inhibitor.

### Angioedema triggered by medication blocking the renin/angiotensin system: Retrospective study using the French National Pharmacovigilance Database [^11121tWM]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Bradykinin-mediated angioedema (AE) is a rare side effect of some medications, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB). In France, side effects of treatments are reported to the national pharmacovigilance database. The national MedDRA database was searched using the term "angioedema". Patients were included if they met the clinical criteria corresponding to bradykinin-mediated AE, if their C1-inhibitor levels were normal, and if they were treated with an ACEi or an ARB.

- **Results**: 7998 cases of AE were reported between 1994 and 2013. Among these, 112 met the criteria for bradykinin-mediated AE with normal C1-inhibitor levels. Of the 112 drug-AE cases, patients were treated with an ARB in 21% of cases (24 patients) or an ACEi in 77% of cases (88 patients), in combination with another treatment in 17 cases (mTORi for 3 patients, iDPP-4 for 1 patient, hormonal treatment for 7 patients). ENT involvement was reported in 90% of cases (tongue: 48.2%, larynx: 23.2%). The median duration of treatment before the first attack was 720 days, and the mean duration of attacks was 36.6 hours. Forty-one percent (19/46) of patients relapsed after discontinuing treatment.

- **Conclusion**: Angioedema triggered by medication blocking the renin/angiotensin system is rare but potentially severe, with a high risk of recurrence despite cessation of the causative drug.

### What is a preferred angiotensin II receptor blocker-based combination therapy for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with diabetic and non-diabetic renal impairment [^112UvZU5]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Hypertension poses a significant risk for organ damage and mortality, risks that are further heightened in patients with previous cardiovascular (CV) events, comorbid diabetes mellitus, microalbuminuria, and renal impairment. Most patients with hypertension require at least two antihypertensives to meet blood pressure (BP) goals, making it crucial to identify the appropriate combination regimen based on individual risk factors and comorbidities for effective risk management. Single-pill combinations (SPCs) containing two or more antihypertensive agents with complementary mechanisms of action offer advantages over free-drug combinations, such as simplification of treatment regimens, convenience, and reduced costs. The improved adherence and convenience resulting from SPC use is recognized in updated hypertension guidelines.

Despite the availability of numerous SPCs for hypertension treatment, clinical evidence from direct head-to-head comparisons that would guide selection for individual patients remains scarce. In patients showing evidence of renal disease or at increased risk for developing renal disease — such as those with diabetes mellitus, microalbuminuria, and high-normal BP or overt hypertension — guidelines recommend renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blocker-based combination therapy due to superior renoprotective effects compared with other antihypertensive classes. RAS inhibitors also mitigate the edema and renal hyperfiltration associated with calcium channel blocker (CCB) monotherapy, thereby making them a favorable option for combination therapy.

β-Adrenergic blockers (BBs) have been associated with an increased risk for severe anaphylactic reactions (AR) from contrast media. However, this was shown with intravenous contrast media before the widespread use of low osmolar contrast media, angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors (ACE-Is), and cardioselective BBs.

- **Objective**: To assess the risk for AR during cardiac catheterization (CC) associated with BB or ACE-I exposure.

- **Methods**: Patients who experienced adverse reactions during CC from January 2004 to December 2013 were identified. One to two matched controls were assigned for each case. We analyzed AR rates in association with demographic variables, medication exposures (BBs, ACE-Is, angiotensin-receptor blockers, aspirin), and comorbidities: cardiovascular disorders, asthma, and atopy.

- **Results**: We analyzed 71,782 CCs. Of these, 70 severe reactors were identified; 46 (0.06%) fulfilled AR criteria. There were 35 cases of mild to moderate AR and 11 cases of severe AR (0.015%). There were no significant differences in age (61.3% vs. 61.5%), sex (63% vs. 64% males), cardiovascular disorder rate (78% vs. 93%), and exposure to BBs (46% vs. 51%; cardioselective: 77% vs. 80%) and ACE-Is (37.0% vs. 37.2%) in cases versus controls. Via multivariate logistic regression, BB exposure was not associated with greater AR frequency (P = 0.35) or severity (P = 0.40). Neither cardioselective BBs (P = 0.2) nor non-cardioselective BBs (P = 0.5) influenced AR severity. ACE-Is had no effect on AR frequency (P = 0.35) or severity (P = 0.14). Lower AR frequency was associated with cardiovascular di.

### Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors versus angiotensin receptor blockers for primary hypertension [^112HdZPs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are widely prescribed for primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure > 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg). However, while ACE inhibitors have been shown to reduce mortality and morbidity in placebo-controlled trials, ARBs have not. Therefore, a comparison of the efficacies of these two drug classes in primary hypertension for preventing total mortality and cardiovascular events is important.

- **Objectives**: To compare the effects of ACE inhibitors and ARBs on total mortality and cardiovascular events, and their rates of withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAEs), in people with primary hypertension.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the ISI Web of Science up to July 2014. We contacted study authors for missing and unpublished information, and also searched the reference lists of relevant reviews for eligible studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials enrolling people with uncontrolled or controlled primary hypertension with or without other risk factors. Included trials must have compared an ACE inhibitor and an ARB in a head-to-head manner, and lasted for a duration of at least one year. If background blood pressure lowering agents were continued or added during the study, the protocol to do so must have been specified.

### Exome sequencing reveals common and rare variants in F5 associated with ACE inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker-induced angioedema [^1141AH8S]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Low credibility.

Angioedema occurring in the head and neck region is a rare and sometimes life-threatening adverse reaction to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Few studies have investigated the association of common variants with this extreme reaction, but none have explored the combined influence of rare variants yet. Adjudicated cases of ACEI-induced angioedema (ACEI-AE) or ARB-induced angioedema (ARB-AE) and controls were recruited at five different centers. Sequencing of 1,066 samples (408 ACEI-AE, ARB-AE, and 658 controls) was performed using exome-enriched sequence data.

A common variant of the F5 gene that causes an increase in blood clotting (rs6025, p. Arg506Gln, also called factor V Leiden) was significantly associated with both ACEI-AE and ARB-AE (odds ratio: 2.85, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.89–4.25). A burden test analysis of five rare missense variants in F5 was also found to be associated with ACEI-AE or ARB-AE (P = 2.09 × 10⁻³).

A combined gene risk score of these variants, and the common variants rs6025 and rs6020, showed that individuals carrying at least one variant had 2.21 (95% CI, 1.49–3.27, P = 6.30 × 10⁻⁹) times the odds of having ACEI-AE or ARB-AE. The increased risk due to the common Leiden allele was confirmed in a genome-wide association study from the United States. A high risk of angioedema was also observed for the rs6020 variant that is the main coagulation defect-causing variant in Black African and Asian populations.

### SPL drug information for captopril [^115GuUkj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of captopril PO (also known as Capoten):

- **ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema**: Use caution in patients taking mTOR inhibitors.

- **Anaphylactoid reactions**: Use caution in patients on hemodialysis with high-flux membranes, desensitizing treatment with hymenoptera venom, or LDL apheresis with dextran sulfate absorption.

- **Decreased blood neutrophil count, agranulocytosis**: Use caution in patients with connective tissue disease (such as SLE or systemic sclerosis) or impaired renal function.

- **Hypotension**: Use caution in patients with HF or volume or salt depletion, such as receiving diuretics or undergoing dialysis.

- **Increased serum potassium**: Use caution in patients with risk factors for hyperkalemia, including renal impairment, diabetes mellitus, or taking medications causing hyperkalemia or potassium supplements.

- **Increased urine protein, jaundice, ALF**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as captopril has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events. Discontinue in case of jaundice or a marked increase in liver enzymes.

### Strategies to meet lower blood pressure goals with a new standard in angiotensin II receptor blockade [^115WHzoc]. American Journal of Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

The continued poor rates of blood pressure (BP) control to the recommended target BP of < 140/90 mm Hg in patients with hypertension indicate a persistent need for improved antihypertensive therapy. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) constitute the newest approved class of antihypertensive agents. Similar to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, ARBs block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system but through a more specific mechanism. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II; however, angiotensin II may be produced by several alternate pathways. In contrast, ARBs inhibit the binding of angiotensin II to the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor, independent of the pathway of angiotensin II production. Comparative safety and efficacy trials indicate that ARBs are similar to other antihypertensive drugs in terms of BP-lowering effectiveness and have superior tolerability.

Olmesartan medoxomil is the newest and one of the most effective ARBs. In controlled trials, it has been shown to provide 24-hour BP control with antihypertensive efficacy at least as good as that of the calcium channel blockers amlodipine besylate and felodipine and the beta-blocker atenolol. In a comparative study, olmesartan medoxomil demonstrated significantly greater reductions in diastolic BP than three other leading ARBs: losartan potassium, irbesartan, and valsartan. With the convenience of placebo-like tolerability and once-daily dosing, combined with excellent antihypertensive efficacy, olmesartan medoxomil stands out as a favorable option.

### Allergic reaction related to ramipril use: a case report [^11565KHy]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are widely prescribed for patients with diabetes as a nephroprotective drug or to treat hypertension. Generally, they are safe for clinical practice, but the relationship between these drugs and angioedema is known. The exact mechanism for ACE inhibitors-induced angioedema is not clear, and it is still a matter of discussion.

- **Case report**: We reported a case of a 23-year-old Black female with an 11-year history of type 1 diabetes, regularly monitored in the department of diabetes, using 0.98 IU/kg/day of human insulin, who presented an allergic reaction 24 hours after ramipril use. The drug had been prescribed to treat diabetic nephropathy. There was no previous history of drug-induced or alimentary allergy. The patient was instructed to discontinue the use of ramipril, and an oral antihistaminic drug and topical corticosteroid were prescribed. Skin biopsies were performed and confirmed the clinical hypothesis of pharmacodermy. The evaluation of ACE polymorphism identified the DD genotype. Six months after the withdrawal of ramipril, the patient was prescribed the angiotensin-II receptor blocker (ARB) losartan as a nephroprotective. She remained well without adverse reactions.

- **Conclusions**: ACE inhibitors-induced angioedema is uncommon, and the clinical presentation is variable with the lips, tongue, oropharynx, and larynx as the most common locations. The presence of angioedema during treatment requires the immediate cessation of treatment due to the risk of possible severe complications.

### Multiple drug intolerance in antihypertensive patients: What is known and what is missing [^113wUvdX]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Low credibility.

Drug allergy and intolerance are increasingly recognized as significant public health concerns, leading to adverse reactions in patients undergoing pharmacological treatments. Multiple drug intolerance syndrome (MDIS), characterized by adverse reactions to at least three different drug classes without a clear immunological mechanism, poses a substantial challenge, particularly in hypertensive patients. Despite its link to suboptimal adherence and uncontrolled blood pressure, MDIS in the context of hypertension remains insufficiently explored.

This review synthesizes existing literature on MDIS, emphasizing clinical characteristics, pathogenesis, and psychiatric comorbidity. Furthermore, it delves into MDIS in the context of hypertension, highlighting the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in diagnosis and management, including innovative therapeutic strategies such as novel therapeutic algorithms or renal denervation. The review concludes by emphasizing the necessity for further research and clinical trials to enhance our understanding and address MDIS, especially in hypertensive patients.

### Emergency department management of patients with ACE-inhibitor angioedema [^111aHQyf]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) are among the most prescribed medications worldwide. Angioedema is a well-recognized adverse effect of this class of medications, with a reported incidence of ACEI angioedema of up to 1.0%. It is important to note that ACEI angioedema is a class effect and is not dose-dependent. The primary goal of this literature search was to determine the appropriate emergency department management of patients with ACEI angioedema.

- **Methods**: A MEDLINE literature search from January 1990 to August 2012 was conducted, limited to human studies written in English, and focused on articles with the keyword "ACEI angioedema". Guideline statements and non-systematic reviews were excluded. The identified studies underwent a structured review from which results could be evaluated.

- **Results**: A total of 562 papers on ACEI angioedema were screened. Of these, 27 appropriate articles were rigorously reviewed in detail, and recommendations were given.

- **Conclusion**: The literature search did not support any specific treatment protocol with a high level of evidence due to the limited nature and limitations of the available studies.

### Association of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers with the risk of hospitalization and death in hypertensive patients with COVID-19 [^115y2dtA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

We constructed cohorts of enrollees for each of the two studies. First, for the outpatient study, we included individuals aged 18 years or older with six or more months of enrollment in Medicare Advantage or commercial insurance from January through December 2019, and available claims data, a diagnosis of hypertension in claims while receiving one or more antihypertensive agents, and a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 in an outpatient setting between March 6, 2020, and May 3, 2020. The Medicare Advantage and commercially insured individuals in the study represented all individuals with available claims in the UnitedHealth Group Clinical Discovery Database who satisfied the inclusion criteria.

Second, for the inpatient study, we identified an inpatient cohort of adults hospitalized with COVID-19. This included all patients aged 18 years or older with at least six months of health insurance enrollment in 2019, available claims data, a diagnosis of hypertension in one or more claims, who were receiving one or more antihypertensive agents, and who were hospitalized with a primary or secondary diagnosis of COVID-19 between January 5, 2020, and May 10, 2020.

For both studies, a diagnosis of hypertension was based on ICD-10 codes, and drug treatment for hypertension was defined by the receipt of one or more agents included in the 2017 American Heart Association hypertension guidelines. These include first-line agents of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics, and dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers.

### Intolerance to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in asthma and the general population: A UK population-based cohort study [^112dJtTX]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Low credibility.

It is recognized that managing comorbidities in patients with asthma may be associated with additional risk. When evaluated for the management of hypertension, ARBs are thought to have similar effects on blood pressure, mortality, and cardiovascular disease outcomes compared with ACEIs. Yet, fewer patients in the general population withdraw from clinical trials because of adverse effects when treated with ARBs compared with ACEIs.

Despite the potentially higher incidence of switching with enalapril, the largest determinant regarding absolute risk in people with asthma appears to be a person's age, sex, and BMI. Given the high prevalence of obesity in the population combined with the increasing age of patients, such factors are important determinants for considering whether ARBs should be recommended as first-line therapy. This is particularly relevant in people with asthma, for whom discriminating ACEI-induced cough from symptoms of uncontrolled asthma may be complex, potentially leading to unnecessary asthma treatment if not immediately recognized.

Many guidelines for the management of patients with cardiovascular disease continue to recommend ACEIs as first-choice therapy, reserving ARBs as an alternative when patients are intolerant to ACEIs. This has led to recent calls to change these recommendations because of the equal efficacy but fewer adverse reactions with ARBs. This change would potentially avoid unnecessary health care appointments, patient treatment disutility, and delays in establishing effective therapy for the underlying clinical condition.

### ACE inhibitors: Upper respiratory symptoms [^114sHPRV]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Cough and angioedema are well-known adverse reactions of ACE inhibitors. However, other adverse effects on the upper airways, such as postnasal drainage, rhinitis, and nasal blockage, are less frequently recognized. These might share the same pathophysiological mechanism: bradykinin accumulation. We present two patients with ACE inhibitor-induced upper respiratory symptoms that improved after discontinuation of ACE inhibitors and substitution with angiotensin II receptor blockers. The incidence of these adverse events is not accurately known since they are not required to be reported, but it is estimated to be low. This presents challenges to physicians and demonstrates the importance of keeping it as a differential diagnosis. Most physicians are aware of ACE inhibitor-induced cough but not of ACE inhibitor-induced nasal blockage, rhinitis, or postnasal drainage. Identifying these can avoid unnecessary diagnostic tests and inappropriate treatment.

### Comparison between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers on the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and death: A meta-analysis [^113xwQzn]. Journal of Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

To compare the effects of angiotensin II receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular mortality, and total mortality, we conducted a meta-analysis of randomized comparative trials. The inclusion criteria were as follows: publication in peer-reviewed journals indexed in Medline, randomized comparison of angiotensin II receptor blockers vs. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin II receptor blockers + angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors vs. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; report of major complications including myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular mortality, or all-cause mortality; and an average follow-up of at least 1 year in at least 200 patients.

Six trials met the inclusion criteria, encompassing a total of 49,924 patients. In the pooled estimate, there were no significant differences between angiotensin II receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in terms of the risk of myocardial infarction (odds ratio 1.01; 95% confidence interval 0.95–1.07; P = 0.75), cardiovascular mortality (odds ratio 1.03; 95% confidence interval 0.98–1.08; P = 0.23), and total mortality (odds ratio 1.03; 95% confidence interval 0.97–1.10; P = 0.20). This was also the case when the analysis focused solely on the comparison between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. Overall, the risk of stroke was slightly lower with angiotensin II receptor blockers.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced angioedema [^1122fnxj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) are widely used, effective, and well-tolerated antihypertensive agents. The mechanisms by which these agents act can cause side effects such as decreased blood pressure, hyperkalemia, and impaired renal function. ACE-I can induce cough in 5%-35% and angioedema in up to 0.7% of treated patients. Because cough and angioedema are considered class adverse effects, switching treatment to other ACE-I agents is not recommended. Angioedema due to ACE-I has a low fatality rate, although deaths have been reported when the angioedema involves the airways. Here, we review the role of bradykinin in the development of angioedema in patients treated with ACE-I, as well as the incidence, risk factors, clinical presentation, and available treatments for ACE-I-induced angioedema. We also discuss the risk for recurrence of angioedema after switching from ACE-I to angiotensin receptor blockers treatment.

### Phenotype standardization of angioedema in the head and neck region caused by agents acting on the angiotensin system [^111Tv3nG]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Angioedema is a potentially life-threatening adverse reaction to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. To study the genetic etiology of this rare adverse event, international consortia and multicenter recruitment of patients are needed. To reduce patient heterogeneity, we have standardized the phenotype. In brief, it comprises swelling in the head and neck region that first occurs during treatment. It should not coincide with urticaria or have another likely cause such as hereditary angioedema.

### β-blockers and ACE inhibitors are not a risk factor for severe systemic sting reactions and adverse events during venom immunotherapy [^116TRcBY]. Allergy (2021). Low credibility.

From August 2014 until January 2018, a total of 1,425 patients were included in the study: 330 of these patients were included in Austria, 41 in the Czech Republic, 68 in Germany, 254 in Italy, 269 in Poland, 279 in Slovenia, 44 in Spain, and 140 in Turkey. Seventy‐five patients refused VIT, and eight patients were lost to follow‐up, resulting in Visit 2 being performed with 1,342 patients. The majority of patients returned to the clinics for the first annual checkup, with Visit 3 being performed with 1,186 patients.

Of all patients included, 388 (27.2%) took antihypertensive drugs: 10.4% took β‐blockers, 11.9% ACEI, and 5.0% both β‐blockers and ACEI. Ninety‐three (7.0%) patients who underwent VIT experienced a systemic adverse event, which were predominantly mild. Only one patient suffered from a Grade III reaction with flush and bronchospasm. Large local reactions (LLR) were observed in 348 (26.3%) patients undergoing VIT.

### β-blockers and ACE inhibitors are not a risk factor for severe systemic sting reactions and adverse events during venom immunotherapy [^111uLYsX]. Allergy (2021). Low credibility.

There is controversy over whether taking β-blockers or ACE inhibitors (ACEI) is a risk factor for more severe systemic insect sting reactions (SSR) and whether it increases the number or severity of adverse events (AE) during venom immunotherapy (VIT).

- **Methods**: In this open, prospective, observational, multicenter trial, we recruited patients with a history of an SSR and an indication for VIT. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate whether patients taking β-blockers or ACEI experience more systemic AE during VIT compared to patients without such treatment.

- **Results**: In total, 1,425 patients were enrolled, and VIT was performed in 1,342 patients. Of all patients included, 388 (27.2%) took antihypertensive (AHT) drugs (10.4% took β-blockers, 11.9% ACEI, 5.0% both β-blockers and ACEI). Only 5.6% of patients under AHT treatment experienced systemic AE during VIT compared to 7.4% of patients without these drugs (OR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.43–1.22, p = 0.25). The severity of the initial sting reaction was not affected by the intake of β-blockers or ACEI (OR: 1.14, 95% CI: 0.89–1.46, p = 0.29). In total, 210 (17.7%) patients were re-stung during VIT, and 191 (91.0%) tolerated the sting without systemic symptoms. Of the 19 patients with VIT treatment failure, 4 took β-blockers, and none took ACEI.

- **Conclusions**: This trial provides robust evidence that taking β-blockers or ACEI neither increases the frequency of systemic AE during VIT nor aggravates SSR. Moreover, results suggest that these drugs do not impair the effectiveness of VIT.

### Exome sequencing reveals common and rare variants in F5 associated with ACE inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker-induced angioedema [^1123yCEM]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Low credibility.

The baseline characteristics of ACEI-induced angioedema cases and controls in the PREDICTION-ADR cohort are presented. The cases and controls were matched for potential risk factors for the development of angioedema, including time under medication, sex, dose, and use of interacting comedication. The sex distribution was 47% female for ACEI-AE and 50% for ARB-AE. A total of 72% had presented with a first occurrence of angioedema. The mean time under medication was 3.44 years for ACEI, with doses ranging from 6.11 mg/day to 20.41 mg/day. For ARB, the mean time was 2.73 years, with doses ranging from 8 mg/day to 125 mg/day. The most commonly suspected ACEI was enalapril (65.8% of all cases), and the most commonly suspected ARB was losartan (6.6% of all cases). A total of 2% of the ACEI-AE cases and 7% of the ARB-AE cases reported that a family member had experienced angioedema from these medications.

Approximately 23% of the study population had type 2 diabetes, primarily due to the recruitment from the Genetics of Diabetes and Audit Research Tayside Study (GoDARTS) in Scotland.

After removing samples and markers failing quality control, 1,033 individuals (387 cases, 646 controls) remained with 178,995 variants. The average per individual genotyping rate was 98.9%. Two sets of data were defined based on the minor allele frequency (MAF); SNPs with MAF 1% were used for single variant analysis (50,838 SNPs).

### Vasotec [^115QtFFn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Presumably because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids and polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin, patients receiving ACE inhibitors (including Vasotec) may be subject to a variety of adverse reactions, some of them serious.

- **Head and neck angioedema**: Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis, and/or larynx has been reported in patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including Vasotec. This may occur at any time during treatment. In such cases, Vasotec should be promptly discontinued, and appropriate therapy and monitoring should be provided until complete and sustained resolution of signs and symptoms has occurred. In instances where swelling has been confined to the face and lips, the condition has generally resolved without treatment, although antihistamines have been useful in relieving symptoms. Angioedema associated with laryngeal edema may be fatal. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis, or larynx, which is likely to cause airway obstruction, appropriate therapy, such as subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1000 (0.3 mL to 0.5 mL) and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway, should be promptly provided [see adverse reactions].

- **Increased risk with coadministration**: Patients receiving coadministration of ACE inhibitors and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitors (e.g. temsirolimus, sirolimus, everolimus) or a neprilysin inhibitor may be at increased risk for angioedema [see precautions].

- **Intestinal angioedema**: Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients.

### Altace [^116vNnax]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Altace is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to this product or any other ACE inhibitor, such as a patient who has experienced angioedema during therapy with any other ACE inhibitor.

- **Contraindications with neprilysin inhibitors**: Altace should not be used in combination with a neprilysin inhibitor (e.g. sacubitril). Do not administer Altace within 36 hours of switching to or from sacubitril/valsartan, a neprilysin inhibitor [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Co-administration with aliskiren**: Do not co-administer Altace with aliskiren in patients with diabetes.

- **History of angioedema**: Angioedema related to previous treatment with an ACE inhibitor, or a history of hereditary or idiopathic angioedema, contraindicates the use of Altace.

### Exome sequencing reveals common and rare variants in F5 associated with ACE inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker-induced angioedema [^116axR29]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Low credibility.

Methods - **Study population and phenotype definitions**: In the PREDICTION-ADR project, cases of ACEI-AE and ARB-AE and controls were recruited at five different centers: Uppsala (Sweden), Dundee (Scotland), Utrecht (the Netherlands), Liverpool (England), and Copenhagen (Denmark). Details are available in the Supplementary Materials (Table S1). All study sites obtained approval from their respective institutional review board or ethics committee. All the recruited cases were adjudicated by a specialist in allergology. Individuals failing adjudication were excluded.

- **Cases**: Cases of ACEI-AE and ARB-AE were defined according to the phenotype standardization published by Wadelius et al, i.e. swelling in the head and neck region without any other likely cause (e.g. allergy or hereditary angioedema). In Sweden, 252 patients with ACEI-AE or ARB-AE were selected from the Swedegene biobank, which is a nationwide collection of ADR cases. Most cases had been recruited among patients reported to the ADR registry at the Swedish Medical Products Agency, but a minority were referred directly from collaborating clinicians. In Denmark, 63 patients with ACEI-induced or ARB-induced angioedema were referred by physicians from seven hospitals and by a collaborating general practitioner. In Scotland, 15 cases were recruited via electronic medical records with the Scottish Health Registry (SHARE), as well as the Genetics of Scottish Health Registry for Adverse Drug Reactions (GoSHARE-ADR) website.

### Exome sequencing reveals common and rare variants in F5 associated with ACE inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker-induced angioedema [^111DaJPL]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Low credibility.

In addition, studies have reported that the risk of ACEI-AE varies according to ethnicity and gender, with women and Black Africans being more likely to develop this particular ADR. Although previous studies assessed common variants in the association between ACEI and angioedema, they have had limited success in identifying a genetic basis for this ADR. This study used next-generation sequencing technology to assess the influence of low-frequency variants with intermediate penetrance and higher relative risks, and combined the association with common variants of ACEI-AE and ARB-AE, using cases and controls recruited in Scotland, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, and England. We report novel results from both analyses of common and rare variants. Replication was performed in a cohort from the United States, and we developed a gene risk score (GRS) for angioedema using common and rare variants of F5.

### Pollen count and presentation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema [^111pcMWf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2013). Low credibility.

The incidence of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-associated angioedema is increased in patients with seasonal allergies.

- **Objective**: We tested the hypothesis that patients with ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema present during months when pollen counts are increased.

- **Methods**: Cohort analysis examined the month of presentation of ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema and pollen counts in the ambulatory and hospital setting. Patients with ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema were ascertained through (1) an observational study of patients presenting to Vanderbilt University Medical Center, (2) patients presenting to the Marshfield Clinic and participating in the Marshfield Clinic Personalized Medicine Research Project, and (3) patients enrolled in The Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET). Measurements include date of presentation of ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema, population exposure to ACE inhibitor by date, and local pollen counts by date.

- **Results**: At Vanderbilt, the rate of angioedema was significantly associated with tree pollen months (P = 0.01 from χ² test). When separate analyses were conducted in patients with a history of seasonal allergies and patients without, the rate of ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema was increased during tree pollen months only in patients with a history of seasonal allergies (P = 0.002). In Marshfield, the rate of angioedema was significantly associated with ragweed pollen months (P = 0.025). In ONTARGET, a positive trend was observed between the ACE inhibit.

### Clinical practice statement: What is the emergency department management of patients with angioedema secondary to an ACE-inhibitor [^116qLh9s]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Angioedema is a complication that has been reported in up to 1.0% of individuals taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is). Importantly, the onset of angioedema can occur anywhere from hours to several years after the initiation of therapy with ACE-Is. Although most cases of ACE-I-induced angioedema (ACE-I-AE) are self-limiting, a major clinical concern is the development of airway compromise, which can potentially require emergent airway management. The underlying pathophysiology of ACE-I-AE is incompletely understood but is considered to be due in large part to excess bradykinin. Numerous medications have been proposed for the treatment of ACE-I-AE. This article is an update to the 2011 Clinical Practice Committee (CPC) statement from the American Academy of Emergency Medicine.

- **Methods**: A literature search in PubMed was performed with the search terms angioedema and ACE inhibitors from August 1, 2012, to May 13, 2019. Following CPC guidelines, articles written in English were identified and then underwent a structured review for evaluation.

- **Results**: The search parameters resulted in 323 articles. The abstracts of these articles were assessed independently by the reviewers, who determined there were 63 articles specific to ACE-I-AE, of which 46 were deemed appropriate for grading in the final focused review.

- **Conclusions**: The primary focus for the treatment of ACE-I-AE is airway management. In the absence of high-quality evidence, no specific medication therapy is recommended for its treatment.

### Risk factors for severe reactions in food allergy: Rapid evidence review with meta-analysis [^115sceJi]. Allergy (2022). Low credibility.

A meta-analysis of 15 observational studies reported that β-blockers (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.3–3.8) or ACE inhibitors (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1–2.2) increased (all-cause) anaphylaxis severity; however, the authors were unable to adjust for underlying cardiovascular disease or any differences between food and non-food triggers. Age is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease and use of β-blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or other vasodilators in patients presenting with anaphylaxis, so it is unclear whether these medicines have a direct impact on severity or if the association is due to confounding (e.g. by underlying cardiovascular disease). In a prospective series of accidental allergic reactions to food, prescription of β-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers was not more common in those experiencing more severe reactions.

Cofactors such as NSAIDs and exercise may influence severity through an impact on allergen absorption. The gastrointestinal epithelial barrier can be impaired in food allergy, although consistent evidence is lacking. Intestinal permeability is not predictive of food allergy, but it may have a key role in WDEIA. Measuring food proteins in serum following ingestion is difficult. Nonetheless, greater absorption kinetics for peanut has been reported in peanut-allergic subjects compared with non-allergic controls; significantly lower amounts of peanut (30 mg protein) were required to detect Ara h 6 in serum samples in peanut-allergic individuals, and for any given peanut dose ingested, higher Ara h 6 was found in sera from peanut-allergic subjects.

### Association of albuminuria levels with the prescription of renin-angiotensin system blockade [^11296y51]. Hypertension (2020). High credibility.

Multiple clinical guidelines recommend an ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) in patients with elevated albuminuria, which can be measured through urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), protein-to-creatinine ratio, or dipstick. However, how albuminuria test results relate to the prescription of ACE inhibitor/ARB is uncertain.

We identified individuals with an ACR measurement between January 1, 2004, and June 30, 2018, and no contraindications or allergy to ACE inhibitor/ARB. We performed multivariable logistic regression analyses to evaluate the association between ACR level and prescription of ACE inhibitor/ARB within six months after the test. We applied similar methods to investigate the association of protein-to-creatinine ratio and dipstick measurement results with the prescription of ACE inhibitor/ARB. Among 67,237 individuals with an ACR measurement, 47.7% were already taking an ACE inhibitor or ARB at the time of the first ACR measurement. Among the 35,138 individuals who were not on ACE inhibitor/ARB, those with higher ACR levels were more likely to be prescribed ACE inhibitor/ARB in the following six months, with steep increases in prescriptions until ACR 300 mg/g, after which the association plateaued. The majority (80.9%) of ACE inhibitor/ARB prescriptions were made by family medicine and internal medicine.

A similar pattern held in the cohorts tested by protein-to-creatinine ratio and dipstick measurement. Our study provides evidence that albuminuria test results change patient care, suggesting that adherence to albuminuria assessment can improve the management of these patients.

### Renin-angiotensin system blockers and the COVID-19 pandemic: At present there is no evidence to abandon renin-angiotensin system blockers [^113qfQnc]. Hypertension (2020). Low credibility.

During the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, reports have emerged indicating that certain groups of patients are at risk of COVID-19, including those with hypertension, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and the elderly. Many of these patients are treated with renin-angiotensin system blockers. Because the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) protein acts as the receptor facilitating coronavirus entry into cells, there has been speculation that treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers might increase the risk of developing severe COVID-19.

The present article examines this concept. ACE2 exists in a full-length, membrane-bound form, while its shorter, soluble form circulates in the blood at very low levels. As a mono-carboxypeptidase, ACE2 contributes to the degradation of several substrates, including angiotensins I and II. ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors do not inhibit ACE2 because ACE and ACE2 are different enzymes. Although angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers have been shown to upregulate ACE2 in experimental animals, the evidence is inconsistent and varies among different angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers and organs. Moreover, there is no evidence to support the notion that ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker administration facilitates coronavirus entry by increasing ACE2 expression in animals or humans. Indeed, animal data support elevated safety and usage.

### ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema [^1129v1uA]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are commonly prescribed for blood pressure control and renal protection. ACEI-induced angioedema is a frequent issue in patients taking ACEIs. In most cases, the disorder is self-limited, with spontaneous episodes of apparently unprovoked angioedema ceasing with the discontinuation of the medication. However, a subset of patients may require hospitalization and even intubation for airway protection. The diagnosis is made clinically, as there are no laboratory studies that establish it definitively. Nonetheless, such investigations help exclude alternative diagnoses as the cause for the patient's presentation.

Conventional treatment regimens used to control allergic angioedema are ineffective for this condition. The mechanism of ACEI-induced angioedema is thought to be related to its effect on the kallikrein-kinin system. Kallikrein is a protease that converts high-molecular-weight kininogens into kinins, primarily bradykinin. Medications developed primarily for hereditary angioedema, such as icatibant and ecallantide, have been used to treat ACEI-induced angioedema with some success. The efficacy and optimal use of these agents remain to be established through randomized and placebo-controlled trials.

### Anaphylaxis: A 2023 practice parameter update [^115TuDwZ]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of hymenoptera sting allergy, specifically concerning venom immunotherapy, the AAAAI 2024 guidelines recommend considering the continuation of β-blockers or ACE inhibitors. This is advised when the medical necessity of the daily medication outweighs the potential increased severity of anaphylaxis to a sting in patients with a history of insect sting anaphylaxis who are not receiving venom immunotherapy.

### Investigation of angioedema associated with the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers [^11526fJP]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are known to cause angioedema.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the time to onset of angioedema and the subsequent episodes of angioedema in patients initially experiencing ACE-I- or ARB-induced angioedema.

- **Methods**: A manual medical record review was conducted on 64 patients with a diagnosis of urticaria, angioedema, or anaphylaxis as a result of taking an ACE-I or ARB. Data recorded included demographic characteristics, time to onset of symptoms, concomitant medication use, laboratory test results, episodes of angioedema, urticaria, or anaphylaxis, and morbidity and mortality.

- **Results**: The mean age of patients with angioedema was 60.2 years (age range, 32–92 years). Women (60%) and African Americans (69%) were more commonly affected. The primary location for angioedema was the lips and tongue. Sixty-one of 64 patients developed at least one episode of angioedema as the result of taking an ACE-I, and 3 patients had angioedema associated with an ARB. The mean time to onset of angioedema after initiation of therapy in 51 patients was 1.8 years, with 13 patients (25%) presenting within the first month and 6 patients (12%) developing angioedema in the first week. No patients required a tracheostomy or died. Also, none of the 6 patients, whose angioedema was attributed to an ACE-I who then received an ARB, developed reangioedema in more than 8.1 patient-years of follow-up.

- **Conclusions**: Angioedema attributable to an ACE-I or ARB resolves on discontinued use of the medication.

### Renin angiotensin aldosterone system blockade: Little to no rationale for ACE inhibitor and ARB combinations [^111LLsb8]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Our understanding of the complexities and interrelated pathways of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system continues to evolve. Which drugs to use, when, and how are everyday questions faced by clinicians in the ambulatory setting. Combining these classes, for the purpose of enhancing renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade and incremental blood pressure, nephroprotective, and cardioprotective effects, logically has emerged as an area for scientific inquiry and clinical use.

Despite the lack of evidence on safety and efficacy in most disease states, dual therapy has been embraced as a treatment option. Most studies of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) combination therapy in the treatment of hypertension have limitations. In contrast, combination ACE inhibitor-ARB therapy in systolic heart failure has been addressed in several large randomized controlled trials.

Until recently, there has been limited and conflicting evidence for the use of combination therapy for the prevention or management of nephropathy. Based on the new evidence, combination ACE inhibitor-ARB therapy in the treatment and management of hypertension, heart failure, and nephropathy should be limited.

### Comparative first-line effectiveness and safety of ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers: A multinational cohort study [^1177rS1o]. Hypertension (2021). Low credibility.

The study investigates the effectiveness and safety of ACE inhibitors compared to angiotensin receptor blockers as a first-line treatment option. Researchers used data from various countries to assess patient outcomes.

- **Methodology**: The multinational cohort study incorporated diverse patient populations, providing a comprehensive analysis of treatment impacts across different demographics.

- **Results**: Findings indicate comparable efficacy between ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, though specific patient characteristics may influence drug choice.

- **Discussion**: Choice of treatment should consider individual patient profiles to optimize outcomes and minimize adverse effects.

Further research is advised to continually evaluate these medications in real-world settings, addressing any emerging safety concerns.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced angioedema [^113mR9gb]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Low credibility.

Angioedema is a well-recognized and potentially lethal complication of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) therapy. In ACEi-induced angioedema, bradykinin accumulates due to a decrease in its metabolism by ACE, the enzyme that is primarily responsible for this function. The action of bradykinin at bradykinin type 2 receptors leads to increased vascular permeability and the accumulation of fluid in the subcutaneous and submucosal space. Patients with ACEi-induced angioedema are at risk for airway compromise because of the tendency for the face, lips, tongue, and airway structures to be affected. The emergency physician should focus on airway evaluation and management when treating patients with ACEi-induced angioedema.

### Intolerance to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in asthma and the general population: A UK population-based cohort study [^11678oth]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Low credibility.

Indirect acting AHR is related to the degree of aeroallergen sensitization and occurs independently of airway caliber or ICS use. This may explain why the effect of bradykinin resulting from ACEI may be specific for asthma but not COPD, in addition to the presence of type 2 inflammation in asthma. This is because AHR is not a key feature in COPD pathogenesis, unless patients have asthma–COPD overlap syndrome. Fixed airway remodeling in COPD may be one reason why a decreased hazard of switching was observed in this population. Our observation of increased ACEI intolerance in patients with BTS step 3 and above may be because such patients have more severe disease. Nevertheless, AHR has been shown to be attenuated by drugs such as ICS, which would be more prevalent in patients taking step 3/4 therapy. Some studies evaluated bronchial reactivity of captopril, ramipril, and enalapril in asthma patients and showed no change in reactivity, although the cumulative number of patients from all studies was only n = 71. This, in addition to studies employing different methods (i.e. histamine, bradykinin, or methacholine challenges or simply measuring lung function), limits the generalizability of the findings.

Although several types of ACEIs are available for clinical use, it cannot be assumed that they are all equally effective or safe without head-to-head comparisons. In our study, the hazard of switching to ARB with enalapril was modestly larger in people with asthma compared with other ACEIs.

### Risk of severe COVID-19 disease with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers: Cohort study including 8.3 million people [^116SUNiL]. Heart (2020). Low credibility.

Although several studies have considered the effect of drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin system in hospitalized patients concerning disease course, none have assessed the population use of these drugs to determine if they modulate susceptibility. We report a large, population-based study where we examined the drug histories of approximately 20% of all patients who tested positive for coronavirus in England to determine if there was an independent association between ACE inhibitor and ARB drug prescription and severe COVID-19 disease susceptibility and progression.

### Combination inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system: Is more better [^116iPGGy]? Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers are considered the standard of care for the treatment of cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease. Combination therapy with both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers effectively inhibits the renin-angiotensin system and potentiates the vasodilatory effects of bradykinin. It has been advocated that this dual blockade approach should theoretically result in improved clinical outcomes in both cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease.

Clinical trial evidence for the use of combination therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers in cardiovascular disease has provided conflicting results in hypertension, congestive heart failure, and ischemic heart disease. Clinical trial evidence to support combination therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers in chronic kidney disease has largely been based on proteinuria reduction as a surrogate marker for clinically meaningful outcomes. Recent large-scale randomized clinical trials have not been able to validate protection in halting progression in chronic kidney disease with a dual blockade approach. This review serves as an appraisal of the clinical evidence of combination angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and angiotensin II receptor blockade in both cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease.

### Intolerance to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in asthma and the general population: A UK population-based cohort study [^1117BoUd]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Low credibility.

Many people are intolerant to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors due to cough, necessitating a switch to an angiotensin-II receptor blocker. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors can impact airway hyperresponsiveness in asthma, potentially mediated by bradykinin or cough reflex sensitivity.

This article adds to our knowledge that individuals with asthma are generally at an increased risk of switching from angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors to angiotensin-II receptor blockers. This risk is greatest in those with more severe asthma. The absolute risk for switching is influenced by factors such as age, sex, and body mass index.

In terms of management guidelines, angiotensin-II receptor blockers could be considered as a first-line option in older individuals with asthma or in young individuals with more severe asthma, including those with other high-risk characteristics.

### Angiotensin receptor blockers: Evidence for preserving target organs [^114t3nQi]. Clinical Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a major problem throughout the developed world. Although antihypertensive treatment regimens reduce morbidity and mortality, patients are often noncompliant, and medications may not completely normalize blood pressure. As a result, therapy frequently does not prevent or reverse the cardiovascular remodeling that often occurs when blood pressure is chronically elevated.

Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is effective in controlling hypertension and treating congestive heart failure. Both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) inhibit the activity of the RAS, but these two classes of antihypertensive medications have different mechanisms of action and different pharmacologic profiles. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors block a single pathway in the production of angiotensin II (Ang II). In addition, angiotensin I is not the only substrate for ACE. The ACE inhibitors also block the degradation of bradykinin, which may have potential benefits in cardiovascular disease. Bradykinin is, however, the presumed cause of cough associated with ACE inhibitor therapy.

Data from clinical trials on ACE inhibitors support the involvement of the RAS in the development of cardiovascular disease. Angiotensin receptor blockers act distally in the RAS to block the Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor selectively. Thus, ARBs are more specific agents and avoid many side effects. Experimental and clinical trials have documented the efficacy of ARBs in preserving target-organ function and reversing cardiovascular remodeling.

### Efficacy and safety of dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system: meta-analysis of randomised trials [^113yP4FY]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

The concept of dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system originated from an experimental model purporting to show a "synergistic" effect between angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. This concept seemed logical and appealing, leading to the acceptance of seemingly beneficial changes in surrogate endpoints like blood pressure, proteinuria, and endothelial dysfunction as evidence of cardioprotective and nephroprotective effects.

Despite the lack of solid evidence on the safety and efficacy of dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, this type of therapy has been mentioned in several guidelines. Thus, dual therapy was commonly used in patients with hypertension and diabetes or proteinuria, or both, and to a lesser extent in those with treatment-resistant heart failure. Even patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension were not entirely able to escape this trend.

In the United States, more than 200,000 patients are currently treated with dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, most with the combination of an angiotensin receptor blocker and ACE inhibitor (70%). Some other combinations are also used, such as two ACE inhibitors (15%), two angiotensin receptor blockers (5%), and ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers in combination with a direct renin inhibitor (8%).

The long-term efficacy and safety of dual blockade are not, however, well defined. We compared the long-term efficacy of the dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (any two of…).

### Does the antihypertensive response to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition predict the antihypertensive response to angiotensin receptor antagonism [^1159RJ9J]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

To test the hypothesis that the antihypertensive response to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition can predict the response to angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R) antagonism, 33 hypertensive patients were randomized to receive lisinopril (20 mg) or losartan (50 mg) for 5 weeks. Patients were then crossed-over to the alternative treatment for a second 5-week period. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) was measured before randomization and on the final day of each period.

The agreement in ABP response between the two drugs was assessed using the following approaches:

- **Response classification**: Subjects were classified as responders and nonresponders using as a threshold an arbitrary level of response (ABP fall ≥ 10 mm Hg systolic or ≥ 5 mm Hg diastolic) or the median ABP response achieved by each of the drugs.

- **Disagreement assessment**: Disagreement between the two drugs in the responders-nonresponders classification was expressed as the proportion of subjects whose ABP responded to one of the drugs only.

Lisinopril was more effective than losartan in reducing ABP (mean difference 4.7 ± 8.1/3.3 ± 5.7 mm Hg, systolic/diastolic, P < .05). Disagreement in the antihypertensive response between the two drugs was found in 39%/33% of subjects for systolic/diastolic ABP using the arbitrary response criterion (33%/39% using the median response criterion). Significant correlations were found between the responses to lisinopril and losartan (r = 0.47/0.59, systolic/diastolic, P < .01).

We conclude that in more than one third of hypertensive subjects, the blood pressure response to ACE inhibition fails to predict the response to AT1R antagonism.

### Exome sequencing reveals common and rare variants in F5 associated with ACE inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker-induced angioedema [^114KcPiC]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). High credibility.

Angioedema occurring in the head and neck region is a rare and sometimes life-threatening adverse reaction to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Few studies have investigated the association of common variants with this extreme reaction, but none have explored the combined influence of rare variants.

Adjudicated cases of ACEI-induced angioedema (ACEI-AE) or ARB-induced angioedema (ARB-AE) and controls were recruited at five different centers. Sequencing of 1,066 samples (408 ACEI-AE, ARB-AE, and 658 controls) was performed using exome-enriched sequence data. A common variant of the F5 gene that causes an increase in blood clotting (rs6025, p. Arg506Gln, also called factor V Leiden), was significantly associated with both ACEI-AE and ARB-AE (odds ratio: 2.85, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.89–4.25). A burden test analysis of five rare missense variants in F5 was also found to be associated with ACEI-AE or ARB-AE (P = 2.09 × 10⁻³).

A combined gene risk score of these variants, and the common variants rs6025 and rs6020, showed that individuals carrying at least one variant had 2.21 (95% CI, 1.49–3.27, P = 6.30 × 10⁻⁹) times the odds of having ACEI-AE or ARB-AE. The increased risk due to the common Leiden allele was confirmed in a genome-wide association study from the United States. A high risk of angioedema was also observed for the rs6020 variant, which is the main coagulation defect-causing variant in Black African and Asian populations. We found that deleterious missense variants in F5 are associated with an increased risk of angioedema.
