## Question

What is the cause of fingers turning blue/purple

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of fingers turning blue or purple. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiology that makes digits appear blue or purple. Then, I should categorize the major etiologic groups and prioritize them by urgency. Next, I will review key differentiators on history and exam, including blanching, pulses, symmetry, and associated features. After that, I will outline a pragmatic diagnostic approach and when to escalate to urgent testing. Finally, I will consider special populations and medication triggers, and close with a concise synthesis that distinguishes benign from dangerous causes, making sure I verify each claim against the cited sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental mechanism: blue or purple discoloration of the digits reflects impaired oxygen delivery or impaired venous outflow, leading to deoxygenated hemoglobin predominance in superficial vessels, which our eyes perceive as cyanosis or violaceous hues. This can be due to arterial insufficiency, venous obstruction, or abnormal circulating blood, and the clinical implications differ accordingly, so I need to keep these buckets in mind as I proceed [^ff92699b] [^7334798d].

> I will now examine the major etiologic categories, but wait, let me verify the canonical framework before listing examples. The most robust clinical schema divides causes into decreased arterial inflow, impaired venous outflow, and abnormal circulating blood, and this framing helps align both benign and life-threatening entities in a way that guides urgency and workup, so I should anchor to that structure here [^ff92699b] [^7334798d].

> Next, I should review decreased arterial inflow causes, and I need to ensure I separate vasospastic from occlusive etiologies. Vasospastic entities include primary and secondary Raynaud phenomenon with classic triphasic color change of white to blue to red, often triggered by cold or stress; secondary Raynaud is particularly concerning for connective tissue disease and can progress to ischemic injury, so I should confirm nailfold capillary changes and systemic features when suspected [^3e385dca] [^3e385dca]. Acrocyanosis presents with persistent, symmetric, painless bluish discoloration of distal extremities that persists after cold exposure and is typically benign once secondary causes are excluded, which I should double-check on exam for symmetry and chronicity [^54c8c10f] [^5bed356a]. Occlusive causes include arterial embolism, thrombosis, and vasculitis; these are emergencies with acute pain, asymmetric involvement, and often nonpalpable pulses, so I should not delay vascular imaging when suspected [^7334798d] [^9521a835].

> Hold on, I should verify medication-induced vasculopathy as a distinct, preventable contributor. Stimulants such as methylphenidate and dextroamphetamine can cause peripheral vasculopathy with Raynaud-like color changes and even digital ischemia; patients should be counseled to report color change, numbness, or new wounds promptly, and I need to ask explicitly about these agents in the history [^61c852e5] [^aa52862f] [^c8e0bda5].

> Now, let me consider impaired venous outflow, and I should confirm the classic clinical clues. Central venous stenosis or occlusion from prior catheters or fistulas can cause unilateral hand swelling with red, purple, or blue discoloration and venous collaterals; this is a vascular access complication and warrants duplex and, if needed, venography and intervention to restore outflow [^7770c3b6]. I initially thought "bilateral" swelling might be typical, but wait, I should correct that: the pattern is usually asymmetric and ipsilateral to the compromised venous drainage, so unilateral features should heighten suspicion rather than bilateral ones [^7770c3b6].

> I need to check the "abnormal circulating blood" category carefully because it includes both hematologic and embolic processes. Cryoglobulinemia, cold agglutinin disease, and polycythemia can impair microvascular flow and cause acral cyanosis or livedo, often with systemic features or laboratory clues, so I should review serologies and hematologic indices when the story fits [^7334798d]. Paraneoplastic or embolic phenomena, including blue toe/finger syndrome, can herald occult malignancy; in patients with unprovoked thrombosis or recurrent digital ischemia, I should consider age-appropriate cancer screening, including colorectal evaluation when indicated [^9e6c849d] [^e929cf56].

> Let me think about the bedside differentiators that separate benign from dangerous causes, and I should confirm each against the literature. Blanching versus nonblanching matters: blanching suggests vasospasm or functional ischemia, whereas nonblanching violaceous changes imply structural vascular compromise or hemorrhage; I should test with pressure and observe capillary refill and pulse quality to triage urgency [^7334798d]. Symmetry and chronicity favor primary acrocyanosis or primary Raynaud, while acute, asymmetric, painful discoloration with abnormal pulses should prompt emergent vascular evaluation for embolic or thrombotic disease [^54c8c10f] [^7334798d]. Associated features such as digital ulcers, necrosis, systemic symptoms, or abnormal labs push toward secondary Raynaud, vasculitis, or embolic etiologies and mandate expedited workup [^3e385dca] [^7334798d].

> Next, I should review a practical diagnostic approach, but wait, I need to ensure I do not overtest low-risk presentations. For acute blue/purple digits with concerning features, I should obtain CBC, metabolic panel, inflammatory markers, coagulation profile, urinalysis, and targeted serologies based on suspicion for connective tissue disease or vasculitis; if pulses are diminished or asymmetric, I should not delay duplex ultrasound, CT angiography, or MR angiography to evaluate for embolic or occlusive disease [^7334798d] [^9521a835]. For chronic, symmetric, painless discoloration without ulcers, primary acrocyanosis or primary Raynaud is likely; nailfold capillaroscopy helps distinguish primary from secondary Raynaud, and routine labs may suffice unless red flags emerge [^3e385dca] [^54c8c10f].

> I should double-check special populations and mimics so I do not miss pediatric or artifactual causes. In children, acrocyanosis and chilblains are common, and Raynaud is rare but documented even in toddlers; careful history of cold exposure and school-related triggers helps, and most cases are managed conservatively with avoidance and warming strategies [^5bed356a] [^3dfdfe8c]. But wait, what if the "cyanosis" is artificial? Munchausen-type presentations with dye or paint can mimic vascular color change; a careful exam and, when suspicion is high, solvent wiping can reveal the deception and prevent unnecessary workup [^95fefd4e].

> Let me reconsider medication-related contributors one more time to ensure I have not overlooked anything. Beyond stimulants, ethosuximide has been linked to severe secondary Raynaud with anti-Scl-70 positivity, and propylthiouracil can cause vasculitis with cutaneous manifestations; a meticulous medication history, including over-the-counter and supplements, is essential before labeling a case as idiopathic [^3ec8c734] [^3e6c347b].

> Finally, I should synthesize a concise, clinically actionable answer. Fingers turn blue or purple when deoxygenated hemoglobin predominates in superficial vessels due to arterial insufficiency, venous obstruction, or abnormal circulating blood; vasospastic entities like Raynaud and benign acrocyanosis are common and often symmetric, whereas acute, asymmetric, painful discoloration with abnormal pulses signals embolic or thrombotic arterial disease and requires emergent vascular assessment; medication-induced vasculopathy, hematologic disorders, and paraneoplastic or embolic syndromes round out the differential, and the correct diagnosis hinges on blanching characteristics, symmetry, chronicity, pulse status, and targeted labs and imaging when indicated [^ff92699b] [^7334798d] [^3e385dca] [^54c8c10f].

Fingers turning blue or purple reflect **impaired oxygen delivery** or **blood flow** to the digits, most often from vasospasm (Raynaud's), acrocyanosis, or vascular obstruction [^3e385dca] [^54c8c10f] [^7334798d]. Common triggers include cold, stress, smoking, and certain medications (e.g. beta-blockers, stimulants) [^c58f9616] [^61c852e5] [^44b30090]. Persistent or painful discoloration warrants evaluation for **serious causes** such as arterial embolism, thrombosis, vasculitis, or connective tissue disease [^7334798d] [^3e385dca]. Management depends on the cause: avoid cold, stop smoking, treat underlying disease, and use vasodilators for severe vasospasm; acute ischemia needs urgent vascular assessment [^5adf19c3] [^7334798d].

---

## Physiological mechanisms

Blue or purple discoloration of the fingers is due to **increased deoxygenated hemoglobin** in the superficial vessels, reflecting reduced oxygen delivery or impaired venous return [^d217665a]. Key mechanisms include:

- **Vasoconstriction**: Excessive arterial or arteriolar constriction reduces arterial inflow, causing ischemia and cyanosis (e.g. Raynaud's) [^c58f9616].
- **Venous stasis**: Impaired venous outflow increases deoxygenated blood in the capillaries and venules (e.g. acrocyanosis, venous obstruction) [^ff92699b].
- **Abnormal circulating blood**: Conditions like methemoglobinemia or sulfhemoglobinemia alter hemoglobin's oxygen-carrying capacity, causing slate-gray or bluish discoloration [^notfound].

## Clinical evaluation

A thorough evaluation should include:

- **History**: Onset, duration, triggers, associated symptoms (pain, numbness, ulcers), medication use, smoking, and family history [^7334798d].
- **Physical examination**: Skin temperature, capillary refill, pulse quality, symmetry, and presence of ulcers or necrosis [^7334798d].
- **Diagnostic tests**: CBC, metabolic panel, inflammatory markers, autoantibodies (ANA, anti-centromere, anti-Scl-70), cold agglutinins, cryoglobulins, and imaging (Doppler ultrasound, angiography) as indicated [^3e385dca] [^7334798d].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Vasospastic disorders**: Avoid cold, stop smoking, use calcium channel blockers, nitrates, or prostaglandin analogs for severe cases [^5adf19c3].
- **Arterial obstruction**: Urgent vascular intervention (thrombolysis, embolectomy, bypass) to restore blood flow [^notfound].
- **Connective tissue diseases**: Immunosuppressive therapy and vasodilators to prevent ischemic complications [^notfound].
- **Medication-induced**: Discontinue offending agents and consider alternatives [^3ec8c734].
- **Environmental factors**: Protect from cold, smoking cessation, and patient education [^37d1457b].

---

## When to seek medical attention

Immediate medical attention is indicated for:

- **Acute, painful, asymmetric discoloration** with poor capillary refill or absent pulses (possible embolism or thrombosis) [^7334798d].
- **Progressive discoloration with ulcers or necrosis** (possible severe ischemia or vasculitis) [^7334798d].
- **Associated systemic symptoms** (fever, weight loss, joint pain) suggesting underlying disease [^notfound].

---

Fingers turn blue or purple due to **reduced oxygen delivery** or impaired venous return; causes include vasospasm, vascular obstruction, connective tissue disease, hematologic disorders, medications, and environmental factors. Persistent or painful discoloration needs prompt evaluation to exclude serious disease, and management is tailored to the cause.

### Blue (or purple) toe syndrome [^ff92699b]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

The blue (or purple) toe syndrome consists of the development of blue or violaceous discoloration of one or more toes in the absence of obvious trauma, serious cold-induced injury, or disorders producing generalized cyanosis. The major general categories are: (1) decreased arterial flow, (2) impaired venous outflow, and (3) abnormal circulating blood. Depending on its pathogenesis, the discoloration may be blanching or nonblanching. An accurate diagnosis is critical, because many of the causes threaten life and limb, but the patient's medical history, accompanying nondermatologic findings on physical examination, and a discriminating use of laboratory tests are usually more important than the nature of the cutaneous abnormalities in determining the cause.

Learning Objectives

After completing this learning activity, participants should be able to define the blue (or purple) toe syndrome, categorize the causes, and recognize the important historical, clinical, and laboratory findings that differentiate the causes and lead to the correct diagnosis.

### The purple digit: an algorithmic approach to diagnosis [^7334798d]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

The acute onset of purple digits is a concerning manifestation and may represent underlying, potentially life-threatening disease. Correctly identifying the etiology of purple digits is essential to proper management, and can aid in the diagnosis of systemic disease. Multiple causes of purple digits and significant overlap in clinical presentation can make diagnosis difficult. Despite the various causes of acute purple digits in the published literature, an algorithmic approach to the evaluation and management of the most common and alarming etiologies has yet to be established. The initial step in evaluating a patient with purple digits is to determine if the cause is associated with hypoxemia or trauma. If the patient is in a stable condition, the dermatologist needs to determine if the process could be related to cold exposure such as Raynaud phenomenon, acrocyanosis, pernio, cryoglobulinemia or frostbite. If the disease occurs independent of temperature, physical examination and histological evaluation of the skin is recommended. The lack of peripheral pulses are concerning for acute arterial thrombosis from peripheral vascular disease or arterial embolism. Non-blanching skin changes on the digit that lack inflammation and microthrombosis most likely represent a bleeding or platelet abnormality; however, if microthrombi are identified a more life-threatening processes such as purpura fulminans or embolic phenomenon may be occurring. Evidence of blood vessel inflammation suggests a leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The patient with a purple blanching digit and normal pulses requires an extensive historical review to help determine the cause. This review presents an algorithmic approach to assist in the evaluation and management of the purple digit.

Brief history

A 65-year-old woman presented for evaluation of a tender, purple discoloration of her left thumb and index finger that had recurred monthly for 3 years (Fig 1). Her symptoms started as an intense burning sensation followed by mild swelling and purple discoloration that spontaneously resolve after 3 to 7 days. She had no systemic symptoms or triggers such as trauma, cold temperatures, or medications. She received metoprolol for supraventricular tachycardia and had Raynaud syndrome, which presented differently. Physical examination revealed a purpuric patch on the palmar aspect of the left thumb, extending onto the dorsal distal aspect of the phalanx. A punch biopsy was performed.

### Impact of fingernail Polish on pulse oximetry measurements: a systematic review [^75a73822]. Respiratory Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The effect of application of fingernail polish on S pO2 measurement remains unclear. We conducted this systematic review to ascertain the impact of fingernail polish on S pO2 measurement.

Methods

We queried PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL databases for publications indexed through December 2022. We included studies providing paired S pO2 data from fingertips without and after nail polish application or reporting the number of subjects whose S pO2 could not be measured due to fingernail polish. We used random effects modeling to summarize standardized mean differences (SMDs) and corresponding 95% CI for different nail polish colors from comparative studies.

Results

We retrieved 122 studies and included 21 publications, mostly performed on healthy volunteers. Of these, 17 (81.0%) studies had a low risk of bias. We summarized mean SMD for 10 nail polish colors (black, blue, brown, green, orange, pink, purple, red, white, and yellow) from 25 paired data sets on S pO2 across 20 studies. We found small (likely clinically insignificant) but statistically significant differences in mean S pO2 when fingers were coated with black, blue, brown, or purple nail polish (SMD -0.57, -0.47, -0.33, and -0.25, respectively; 95% CI -0.86 to -0.29, -0.84 to -0.10, -0.59 to -0.07, and -0.48 to -0.02, respectively). Only one of 4 studies reported a high proportion of unsuccessful oximeter readings from fingers painted with black (88.0%) or brown (36.0%) nail polish.

Conclusions

Although fingernail polish of some colors can marginally reduce S pO2 reading or occasionally impede S pO2 measurement, the variability is clinically insignificant.

### Following replicative DNA synthesis by time-resolved X-ray crystallography [^5ef7ae29]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The initiation step of DNA synthesis

The initiation step of DNA synthesis was investigated by monitoring extension of the primer by a nucleotide that is complementary to the first unpaired base in the template. The starting conformation observed at 0 min (Fig. 1) shows an active site configuration in which Y714 stacks directly over the 3′ end of the primer (position 10, P10) and the unpaired portion of the template strand takes a sharp turn (~90°) at the base of the finger subdomain with the next 5′ base (thymine at template position 5, T5) held outside the active site by a stacking interaction with the side chain of Y719. By 1 min, a small conformational change occurs at the base of the O-helix, leading to an opening of the O-O1 loop connecting the O and O1 helices in the finger subdomain (Fig. 1). This movement of the finger subdomain causes the dsDNA duplex to shift ~6 Å to a position where Y714 now stacks directly over the center of the DNA duplex. Electron density of the thymine base at position T5 is weakened, indicating that the next unpaired base in the template is transitioning to a subsequent position in the reaction cycle.

### First self [^8a96d620]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

The last day she spoke to me, she was dressed in red sweat pants and a loose purple jersey top with long sleeves. Her nose ran. When I came into her room, she was lying in bed staring at the ceiling. She rarely spoke complete sentences. She never recognized me. I sat next to her and for several moments said nothing.

The room was split in two by a red blanket hung as a curtain. On the other side of the curtain was another bed. Sometimes Mom had roommates, but for the last week or two, no one had occupied the other bed. Full or empty, the other bed held no interest for Mother. The floor was covered in spattered beige tiles.

I enjoyed these moments, sitting quietly next to her — moments stolen from reality, shielded from certainty. I wasn't an immunologist here, just an old woman's son wishing for things that could never be. I reached out and held her hand, thin now with thickened blue veins and knuckles fat from inflammation. She turned to me.

"Hello", I said.

"Hello", she said with obvious pleasure.

Then she lifted my hand to her lips and kissed my finger tips.

"How are you?" I asked because whether someone is dying, bleeding to death from a severed limb, or just finishing a pastrami sandwich, that question inexplicably comes to my lips.

"Fine", she said and turned back to the ceiling, smiling. "I'm fine".

I wiped her nose.

Today, she wore no lipstick, and the aides had taken her bridge from her mouth. Four of her lower front teeth were missing. Her tongue fell through the opening when she spoke and twisted her words.

### Raynaud's phenomenon (secondary) [^c58f9616]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2014). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Raynaud's phenomenon is episodic vasospasm of the peripheral vessels. It presents as episodic colour changes of the digits (sometimes accompanied by pain and paraesthesia), usually in response to cold exposure or stress. The classic triphasic colour change is white (ischaemia), then blue (de-oxygenation), then red (reperfusion). Raynaud's phenomenon can be primary (idiopathic) or secondary to several different conditions and causes. When secondary (e.g., to systemic sclerosis), it can progress to ulceration of the fingers and toes. This review deals with secondary Raynaud's phenomenon.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of surgical interventions in complicated secondary Raynaud's phenomenon? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to March 2014 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found two studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: botulinum toxin, simple debridement/surgical toilet of ulcers, peripheral sympathectomy (digital, digital plus sympathectomy of the ulnar and/or radial artery, ligation of the ulnar artery), cervical/thoracic sympathectomy, arterial reconstruction (venous graft, arterial graft, balloon angioplasty), and amputation.

### The case of a painful blue thumb [^875851cc]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Raynaud syndrome — Incorrect. Raynaud syndrome is the abnormal vasoconstriction of digital arteries and arterioles because of cold temperatures, emotional stress, or systemic disease. Although it may cause pain, it usually lasts for 15 to 20 minutes and is characterized by multiple discolorations (eg, white, blue, red).
B. Polyarteritis nodosa — Incorrect. Several vasculitides (eg, Takayasu arteritis, cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis, polyarteritis nodosa, microscopic polyangiitis) may result in digital purpura. However, these vasculitides are often associated with other systemic findings and do not follow a benign cyclical pattern.
C. Arterial embolism — Incorrect. Although an arterial embolus causes acute pain and discoloration, patients typically have subsequent tissue necrosis, rather than spontaneous resolution, without intervention.
D. Achenbach syndrome — Correct. This is a case of Achenbach syndrome, a rare, self-limiting condition of unknown etiology that predominantly affects middle-aged women. The syndrome is characterized by recurrent paroxysmal hematoma in the fingers, often in the left hand. Clinically, patients present with a sudden burning pain and cyanosis in 1 or more digits (usually the index or middle finger, and less commonly the thumb) that may be associated with swelling, pruritus, coldness, and restricted digit movement, followed by spontaneous resolution without treatment. In the absence of concerning history or alarm symptoms and signs (eg, fever, hypertension, nonpalpable pulses, cutaneous necrosis or ulceration), the diagnosis is established clinically and does not require further testing or procedures.
E. Traumatic hematoma — Incorrect. The patient denied history of repeated trauma or conditions that increase vascular fragility such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

### Effect of nail Polish and henna on oxygen saturation determined by pulse oximetry in healthy young adult females [^ade84622]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of different colour nail polishes and henna on the measurement of oxygen saturation and the differences among the measurements of three pulse oximetry devices.

Material and Methods

33 healthy females with a mean age of 19 ± 1.0 years and no complaints or known disease were included into the study. All the participants applied henna to one of their fingers a day before the study. Just before the study, one finger was left empty as control and the other fingers were dyed using various colours of nail polish (red, blue, beige, purple, brown, white, pink, green, colourless polish, light blue, light green and yellow). There were more than eight colour nail polishes and some fingers were used for the other colours after being completely cleaned. The same brand nail polishes were used for the study. Oxygen saturation measurements were done using three different pulse oximetry devices (device I, II, III) from the control, different colour nail polished and henna applied fingers. The measurements of different devices, different colour nail polishes, henna and control were statistically compared.

Results

The mean saturations obtained from blue, beige, purple and white nail polished fingers were significantly lower than those of control and the other coloured fingers. In addition, the mean measurement of device II was significantly lower than those of other devices.

Conclusion

The results suggest that blue, beige, purple and white nail polished fingers might cause pulse oximetry devices to make incorrect measurements.

### Acute blue finger syndrome: a rare benign cause of acute digit discolouration [^19151afc]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Acute blue finger syndrome is a rare benign condition that mimics digital ischaemia. We discuss the case of a 32-year-old woman who presented with a 6hour history of blue discolouration of the middle finger of the right hand, associated with pain and swelling. There was no history of trauma and this was the first time that the patient had experienced these symptoms. Examination found blue discolouration of the digit primarily on the volar aspect with associated swelling. All investigations, including blood tests, X-rays and Doppler scanning, were normal. The symptoms resolved spontaneously within 48hours. There were no recurrent episodes or long-term sequelae. Patients presenting with an acutely blue finger need rapid assessment to exclude digit ischaemia. Knowledge of this rare benign condition may prevent unnecessary distress, invasive investigations and potentially harmful treatment of a healthy patient.

Classification of Disease: Who to Fit Where

Raynaud's Phenomenon and the Concept of "Early SSc"

The clinical spectrum and prognosis of SSc are highly heterogeneous, but strikingly in at least 95% of the cases, the onset of disease is preceded -sometimes by years -by the occurrence of Raynaud's phenomenon (RP). RP reflects an impaired balance between vasoconstriction and vasodilation in response to different stimuli -mainly cold or emotional stress -and it is characterized by episodic color changes of the extremities (predominantly the digits) turning white (ischemia), blue (cyanosis), and red (reperfusion). RP is common also in the general population and is most often harmless (primary, PRP), but in a small percentage of cases, RP is the alarm bell for an underlying disease. In several autoimmune conditions, RP is a presenting sign or a complication of a long-lasting disease, including SLE, RA, Sjogren's syndrome (SjS) or other connective tissue diseases in general. However, it is SSc that accounts for most of the cases of the so-called secondary RP whose occurrence in a previously healthy individual should always raise the suspicion of a developing sclerodermatous condition. This, of course, naturally leads to a key question: is it possible to identify the source of RP and early identify the presence of an underlying pathological conditions? Several lines of evidence indicate that in PRP, vascular abnormalities are mostly functional, while in secondary RP, especially in SSc-related RP, structural endothelial alterations can be observed. Nailfold videocapillaroscopy (NVC) has slowly emerged as a necessary tool to visually highlight microvascular alterations and the endothelial derangement which characterize SSc. The NVC patterns of SSc-related microangiopathy are now well characterized and formalized from a qualitative and quantitative point of view.

4.8 Wound bed preparation

Management of the wound surface environment to promote wound healing. Specifically, necrotic tissue is removed, the bacterial load is reduced, wound drying is prevented, excessive exudates are controlled, and pockets and wound margins are treated.

4.9 Moist wound healing

Maintaining a moist wound surface. This retains multinucleated leukocytes, macrophages, enzymes, and cell growth factors within exudates on the wound surface. Such an environment promotes autolysis and the removal of necrotic tissue and does not interfere with cell migration.

4.10 Raynaud phenomenon

Finger/toe vasospasm triggered by cold or psychological stress, causing clearly bordered color changes in the fingers/toes. Three‐phase color changes of white–purple–red are typically observed.

4.11 Finger/toe tip ulcer

Skin ulcer occurring at the end of a finger or toe primarily due to peripheral circulatory disorders. This usually painful condition occurs frequently in patients with SSc but is also observed even in patients who show no skin sclerosis and do not satisfy the diagnostic criteria for SSc.

### A narrative review of pathogenetic and histopathologic aspects, epidemiology, classification systems, and disease outcome measures in systemic sclerosis [^66f072a2]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

RP, the most common clinical sign of the disease, found in more than 96% of SSc patients, is a clinical diagnosis indicating fingers' color change, determined by an aberrant digital perfusion, which represents an exaggerated physiological response to trigger factors. Differently from the primary RP, SSc-related RP is an irreversible process which can result in substantial morbidity and disability, and, thus, is an important therapeutic challenge for rheumatologists. During the episode, often caused by cold exposure or emotional stress, the initial pallor is caused by vasoconstriction of pre-capillary arterioles, then the following purple color is related to the cyanosis, and the final red color is caused by post-ischemic hyperemia (reperfusion). In SSc-related RP, the tissue ischemia is persistent and can result in DU and/or gangrene. A central event in the pathogenesis of RP is the imbalance between vasodilatation and vasoconstriction, in favor of the latter. Despite the fact that mechanisms have to be fully elucidated, an impairment in vasodilatation, primarily due to an endothelial dysfunction, was well demonstrated, but other complex factors have been involved, such as the imbalance in the renin–angiotensin system, in favor of angiotensin II. The alteration in the endothelial production of nitric oxide (NO), prostacyclin, and endothelin 1 is a matter of debate. Several studies demonstrated an upregulation of the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in SSc, which leads to the production of large quantities of NO, that may have strong pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic properties; on the other hand, the endothelial isoform of nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is decreased. Globally, the NOS function seems to be decreased in SSc endothelial cells, also for the decreased vasculature compliance due to the fibro-proliferative change. In addition, reduced NO production via neuronal NOS (nNOS) could also have a role. The significance of these mechanisms in SSc pathogenesis is demonstrated by the efficacious administration of drugs acting on NO signaling pathways, such as phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors and stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase (riociguat). Structural abnormalities of the microvasculature (such as capillary dilatation and loss, and arteriolar stenosis, in the frame of progressive microangiopathy) and of the digital arteries contribute to impaired digital perfusion in SSc. They represent a consequence of endothelial dysfunction (caused by endothelial injury, possibly autoantibody mediated, followed by endothelial cell apoptosis), aberrant production of growth factors and cytokines, activation of pericytes, and abnormalities of both angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. As a contributing factor, an inhibitory splice variant of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) leads to insufficient angiogenesis in patients with SSc.

### Hand and foot color change: diagnosis and management… [^5bed356a]. publications.aap.org (2017). Low credibility.

Primary care clinicians are challenged to evaluate an array of different hand and foot color changes in kids, as treatment may range from reassurance of a benign, self-limited condition to further diagnostic evaluation and treatment with vasodilator pharmacotherapy. The most common and well-known causes of these color changes are Raynaud phenomenon, acrocyanosis, and the more rare but serious erythromelalgia. Clinicians should be aware of the clinical presentation, symptoms, etiologic origins, diagnostic evaluation, treatment, and potential complications of Raynaud phenomenon, acrocyanosis, and erythromelalgia in children. After completing this article, readers should be able to: Acrocyanosis is a clinically benign process that is known to cause alarm in patients and their parents. Acrocyanosis typically presents as symmetrical blue and/or purple discoloration in the peripheral extremities, usually either the hands or the feet.

### Caffeine citrate [^da7355a5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

To open a vial of caffeine citrate oral solution:

Hold the blue plastic top between the thumb and index finger. Use your thumb to flip the blue plastic top completely off the vial.
Carefully lift up the metal ring.
Pull the metal ring away from the vial and then pull it down towards the bottom of the vial without twisting the ring.
After you pull the ring down and the metal band around the top of the vial is completely broken through, carefully remove the rest of the metal band by pulling it out and away from the vial.
Being careful not to spill any medicine, remove the rubber stopper from the top of the vial.

To remove the prescribed dose from the vial:

You will need a small syringe to measure the exact amount of medicine that your baby's doctor prescribed. Your baby's doctor, nurse or pharmacist will give you this small syringe. Note that a milliliter (ml) is the same as a cubic centimeter (cc).

Insert the tip of the syringe in the medicine and pull up on the plunger to draw the medicine into the syringe. Remove slightly more of the medicine than the exact amount to be given to your baby.

Turn the syringe tip up so that any air in it rises to the top. Remove the air by gently pushing up on the syringe plunger. Continue to push the syringe plunger up to remove any extra medicine in the syringe, until only the exact number of milliliters (or cubic centimeters) that your baby's doctor prescribed remains in the syringe.

### The case of a painful blue thumb [^13ebdc67]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What would you expect to find in the diagnostic evaluation of this case?
A. Elevated prothrombin time
B. Normal complete blood cell count
C. Atrial fibrillation on electrocardiogram
D. Elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate
E. Venous thrombosis on left-sided upper extremity ultrasonography

Answers:
A. Elevated prothrombin time — Incorrect. An elevated prothrombin time would be expected if the patient had a history of anticoagulant use, liver disease, vitamin K deficiency, or coagulation factor deficiency. Patients with an elevated prothrombin time may report severe and frequent bleeding and present with hemarthrosis and extensive ecchymoses, whereas this patient reported only localized symptoms in her thumb.
B. Normal complete blood cell count — Correct. Achenbach syndrome is associated with normal complete blood cell counts, as well as normal coagulation parameters and inflammatory markers.
C. Atrial fibrillation on electrocardiogram — Incorrect. This finding would be expected if the patient's symptoms were secondary to arterial emboli. However, arterial occlusion would result in irreversible tissue necrosis and require intervention, neither of which was true in this case because this patient's symptoms return to baseline between episodes.
D. Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate — Incorrect. We would expect this finding if the underlying etiology were a vasculitis or other rheumatologic disease contributing to secondary Raynaud syndrome. However, given the absence of systemic and histopathologic findings, neither of these diagnoses is likely.
E. Venous thrombosis on left-sided upper extremity ultrasonography — Incorrect. Although a venous thrombus can cause swelling, pain, and color changes to the finger, these symptoms would not recur or self-resolve monthly for several years, as in this case. Also, the patient did not have risk factors such as trauma, surgery, or recent immobility to place her at risk for venous thrombosis.

### Acute blue finger: a diagnostic challenge [^9521a835]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

The management of the acute blue finger is controversial with many regarding it as a benign condition. However, we would argue that it should always be considered as an emergency. We present a challenging case of a 43-year-old woman who presented with a 1-week history of sudden onset blue discolouration of the left fifth digit, and a 6-week history of episodic joint problems. Examination showed bilateral normal radial and ulnar pulses. Following blood investigations, an initial working diagnosis of early rheumatoid arthritis with associated Raynaud's phenomenon was made. Also, infective endocarditis was considered due to temporary misleading physical signs. Later, CT angiography of the left upper limb arteries showed a significant proximal left subclavian stenosis. Subsequently, a diagnosis of the left subclavian arteritis associated with digit ischaemia from embolic debris was made and the patient underwent a left subclavian angioplasty. However, delayed management resulted in a necrotic digit, which was left to autoamputate.

### Genome analyses reveal population structure and a purple stigma color gene candidate in finger millet [^d7d19e13]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Finger millet is a key food security crop widely grown in eastern Africa, India and Nepal. Long considered a 'poor man's crop', finger millet has regained attention over the past decade for its climate resilience and the nutritional qualities of its grain. To bring finger millet breeding into the 21 st century, here we present the assembly and annotation of a chromosome-scale reference genome. We show that this ~1.3 million years old allotetraploid has a high level of homoeologous gene retention and lacks subgenome dominance. Population structure is mainly driven by the differential presence of large wild segments in the pericentromeric regions of several chromosomes. Trait mapping, followed by variant analysis of gene candidates, reveals that loss of purple coloration of anthers and stigma is associated with loss-of-function mutations in the finger millet orthologs of the maize R1/B1 and Arabidopsis GL3/EGL3 anthocyanin regulatory genes. Proanthocyanidin production in seed is not affected by these gene knockouts.

### Raynaud's phenomenon – or just skin with dye? [^95fefd4e]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Munchausen's syndrome is a factitious disorder resulting in unnecessary investigations and operative treatments in a small and well-defined population. Autobiographical falsification is the characteristic of the entity. The case history is presented of a 28-year-old woman admitted to the emergency department with severe pain of acute onset in her fingers and discoloration while washing dishes. She had been diagnosed with Raynaud's phenomenon and had been on antiepileptic drugs. The fingertips of both hands looked cyanotic. Radial and ulnar pulses were intact. She had argued with the personnel obtaining vital signs and had a tendency to hide her right hand, which raised the suspicion that a psychiatric disorder was the primary cause of the visit to the emergency department. A blue piece of dirt on the left shoulder had also augmented these concerns. Munchausen's syndrome was suspected after careful handshaking with hands soaked in alcohol resulted in a blue discoloration on the doctor's palm and fingers. Emergency and primary care physicians should be alert to this type of situation, with a myriad possible scenarios to be differentiated from real conditions.

### Effect of nail Polish on oxygen saturation determined by pulse oximetry in critically ill patients [^51196a79]. Resuscitation (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Nail polish of different colours may alter accuracy and precision of pulse oximetry as previous data in healthy volunteers suggest. This trial evaluates the oxygen saturation determined by pulse oximetry and haematoximetry with nail polish of nine different colours applied.

Material and Methods

Fifty critically ill and mechanically ventilated patients in an ICU were investigated in a prospective clinical-experimental trial. On nine finger nails polish of different colours was applied in a predetermined consecutive order. Functional oxygen saturation was determined by pulse oximetry (SpO2) on each finger for each colour with the finger sensor probe both in the normal position and at a 90 degrees rotation. Simultaneously oxygen saturation was determined by haematoximetry (SaO2). Accuracy (bias, DeltaS = SaO2-SpO2) and precision (standard deviation, S.D.) of pulse oximetry were analyzed with the t-test. A value of P < 0.05 was considered significant.

Results

While black (DeltaS = +1.6 ± 3.0%), purple (DeltaS = +1.2 ± 2.6%) and dark blue nail polish (DeltaS = +1.1 ± 3.5%, each N = 50) had the greatest effect (P < 0.05), all other colours, including colourless nail polish, had a smaller effect (mean bias +0.2 to +0.9%). A rotation of 90 degrees reduced the bias from +2.8 to +1.3% (N = 10, n.s.).

Conclusion

Nail polish does not alter pulse oximetry readings in mechanically ventilated patients to a clinically relevant extent. The mean error of measurement for all colours was within the manufacturers' specified range of ± 2%. A 90 degrees rotation of the sensor probe does not eliminate errors in measurement. To remove nail polish might be helpful to decrease the error of measurement in some cases.

### An autopsy review: "COVID toes" [^190342d7]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2" (SARS-CoV-2) infection has variable described dermatologic manifestations. "COVID (coronavirus disease) toes" became a hallmark of the disease in young and largely asymptomatic patients, who may have negative test results for SARS-CoV-2. Pernio (chilblains)-like lesions are seen mostly in infected pediatric patients and are purple painful, frequently bilateral, ill-defined plaques with prominent inflammation on histological examination. In contrast to pernio-like presentation in children, critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 develop "purple" digits that may be sharply demarcated and may demonstrate asymmetric areas of ischemia. These 2 contrasting entities are sometimes grouped together as "COVID toes" due to some similarities in clinical appearance and presentation. Here, we summarize histopathologic examination from an autopsy, including the cutaneous lesions from the affected and normal contralateral toes and correlate them with systemic findings. In contrast to pernio-like lesions, the skin of the affected necrotic toes contained thrombi in vessels without prominent inflammation, suggestive of an embolic event. This is further supported by the clinical history of and autopsy findings of popliteal artery thrombus and multiple subsegmental pulmonary emboli. Our findings suggest that critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 have different pathological processes affecting skin at peripheral sites (ie, fingers, toes, ears, and nose), which may be due to thromboembolic events. The skin is a mirror of the body and skin pathology may shed light into overall pathogenesis of systemic illness and processes.

### The British society of gastroenterology / UK-PBC primary biliary cholangitis treatment and management guidelines [^37d1457b]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Miscellaneous

Up to one-quarter of patients with PBC have Raynaud's phenomenon which occurs due to spasmodic arterial contraction in the extremities (usually fingers and toes, but sometimes ears and nose). Patients should be asked specifically about the classical symptoms of their extremities turning white, then blue and finally red, often associated with pain/burning/tingling when the blood flow returns. Practical measures, such as wearing gloves, using hand warmers and avoiding cold environments, are often all that are needed for mild symptoms. For more marked symptoms, vasodilators such as calcium channel blockers can be used. Specialist rheumatological advice should be sought for severe symptoms and those at risk of digital ulceration. Approximately 8% of patients with PBC have limited scleroderma (CREST syndrome: Calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, oEsophageal dysmotility, Sclerodactyly, Telangiectasia). These symptoms and signs should be sought and, if present, patients should be referred for rheumatology advice. Social isolation, fatigue, anxiety and depression are important predictors of poor perceived QoL in PBC. Primary care providers should consider assessing patients for features of depression and, where appropriate, a trial of antidepressants may be helpful.

### Gray-blue discoloration of the proximal nail beds [^385ed074]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 58-year-old Caucasian woman presented with asymptomatic gray-blue discoloration of the proximal nail beds of her fingernails (Fig 1). She described 5 years of gradually worsening gray-blue perioral macules coalescing into patches and on examination was observed to also have diffuse gray-blue discoloration of the bilateral auricular helices and sclerae. Her past medical history was significant for smoking, nephrolithiasis, acne vulgaris and hidradenitis suppurativa. The patient declined biopsy or treatment.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Normal variant
B. Argyria
C. Minocycline-induced pigmentation
D. Wilson disease (hepatolenticular degeneration)
E. B12 deficiency

Answers:
A. Normal variant – Incorrect. Although blue lunula can be observed in otherwise healthy black individuals, it would not be considered normal variant in a patient of this skin type. The gray-blue discoloration also extends into the nail bed, beyond the lunula, in this case.
B. Argyria – Incorrect. Argyria is in the differential diagnosis for blue lunula. This patient did not have a history of silver supplementation or other exposure.
C. Minocycline-induced pigmentation – Correct. Given the patient's past medical history of acne and hidradenitis suppurativa, for which tetracycline antibiotics are frequently utilized, and blue-gray pigmentation of her skin, sclera(Fig 2), helices (Fig 3), and nail beds, this is the correct diagnosis. She took minocycline 100 mg daily by mouth for 25 years.
D. Wilson disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) – Incorrect. Wilson disease, an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism, is in the differential for a patient with blue lunula; however, the color does not extend into the nail bed as in this case. Wilson disease also presents with cirrhosis, hyperpigmentation, and pruritus.
E. B12 deficiency – Incorrect. Blue or blue-black discoloration of the nails can be observed in the setting of vitamin B12 deficiency, however this is diffuse and secondary to melanocyte activation as opposed to depositional etiology as in this case.

### The role of inhibitory and excitatory neurometabolites in age-related differences in action selection [^f208b14e]. Npj Aging (2025). Medium credibility.

Task description

Participants were instructed to place each finger on the corresponding button and press it (Fig. 7B) and only lift specific fingers of the left and/or right hand, as cued on the screen. Two white hands corresponding to the left and right hands were presented on a black background, and the middle and index fingers were presented in gray color. Each trial started with a 1500 ms interval during which participants were instructed to press all four fingers and keep them pressed, waiting for the cues. Upon pressing the proper button, the corresponding gray cues turned white. In case not all the keys were pressed during the aforementioned period, the trial was aborted. Once all four buttons were pressed simultaneously and the 1500-ms interval was over, a cue appeared after a random jitter of 400–500 ms. The purpose of this jitter was to avoid the prediction of cue presentation time by the participants. Subsequently, a subset of the finger cues appeared on the screen in which the to-be-moved fingers turned blue. In response to this stimulus, participants needed to release contact with the corresponding button(s) as quickly and as correctly as possible by lifting the cued finger(s). Upon lifting the correct finger(s), the corresponding cue(s) turned green, and upon lifting the wrong one(s), the corresponding cue(s) turned red. A trial was only validated when the response was fully correct (i.e. without any red cues on the screen) within 4800 ms from the start of the trial. Afterward, all the cues turned back to gray. Then, the participant repositioned all fingers and pressed the buttons to start a new trial. If the participants did not react within 4800 ms from the start of the trial, the trial was considered aborted. Reaction time was measured as the elapsed time from the appearance of the cue to the lifting of all of the cued fingers. Details of the trial procedure are presented in Fig. 7D.

All the 15 possible stimulus modes were tested: 4 single-finger conditions, 6 two-finger conditions, 4 three-finger conditions, and 1 four-finger condition (Fig. 7C). We merged these subtests to finally obtain a single measure per participant for SRT, CRT and NRT.

L protein is catalytically active in the presence of 3′-vRNA, and is activated by the presence of Mg 2+ or Mn 2+, which is essential for the polymerase activity. Meanwhile, L could not be activated by Zn 2+ (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Our in vitro assay also showed clearly that in the presence of Z, the RNA synthesis activity of L will be inhibited (Supplementary Fig. 4b). To confirm the interaction of L protein with RNA, we performed an Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA). Both L and L–Z complex can bind individually to the 3′-vRNA while the length of RNA has a profound effect on the binding affinity (Supplementary Fig. 4c), indicating that the L-binding region resides in the terminal 40 nt of the 3′-vRNA.

### Idiopathic chilblains [^c08366c7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Chilblains is a benign condition infrequently encountered in clinical practice; its resemblance to vasculitis or peripheral thromboemboli can often result in an extensive and unnecessary diagnostic work-up.

Method

Three cases of chilblains seen by our Rheumatology service, along with 113 documented cases, were reviewed.

Results

Chilblains is characterized by painful red-to-purple papular lesions involving the acral surface of fingers or toes that resolves with symptomatic treatment. Female sex and low body mass index are risk factors.

Conclusion

Distinct clinical features of chilblains can be used for early recognition and management, thus avoiding unnecessary diagnostic testing and delays in patient care.

### Intact finger representation within primary sensorimotor cortex of musician's dystonia [^213ed99f]. Brain (2023). Medium credibility.

Figure 6
Disease models for task-specific dystonia. (A) Traditional distorted somatotopy hypothesis. The receptive field for each finger in S1 is drawn (thumb = red, index = orange, middle = green, ring = light blue and little = dark blue). In health, this idealized cartoon shows receptive fields as discrete areas. The corresponding signal across a strip of cortex cleanly maps to an individual finger. In task-specific dystonia overlapping and disorganized receptive fields lead to a mixing of signals and uncertainty of finger mapping. (B) Possible neural representation of a complex task. A small piece of music, which requires a series of finger presses of the right hand on a piano, may be represented in a hierarchical fashion with sequences and chunks (short stereotyped elements grouped 4-2-3 in this example) that then in turn activate the elementary movement components. (C) An alternative task such as a series of keyboard presses requires the same sequence of finger presses as the piano task. However, if the chunking converges on a different pattern (e.g. grouping of 3-3-3), immediately a different set of higher-order control elements are required for typing the same sequence of finger presses. This is one potential neural mechanism for a task-specific deficit. (D) Recent fMRI work in normal controls shows that while single finger movements are represented in M1 and S1 (blue), chunks (pink) and sequences (orange) are represented in overlapping regions of premotor and parietal cortex.

### Blue nodule on the finger [^8f8a49da]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical presentation

A 67-year-old woman sought treatment for a painful nodule on the perionychium of the right second finger that had rapidly enlarged over the previous year. The patient reported that the point of a lead pencil had become lodged in her skin at the age of 10 years. The nodule was blue-gray in color, 9.6 mm in maximum diameter, and unattached to the subcutaneous tissue (Fig 1).

### Blue lunula due to hydroxyurea [^bfd2480d]. The Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Alteration in the color of lunula can be an indication of either a cutaneous or systemic disorder or a systemic drug side effect. Hydroxyurea, an antitumor systemic agent (a ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase inhibitor) used in the treatment of refractory psoriasis as well as in the variety of neoplastic disorders is known to cause brownish pigmentation of the nails but hydroxyurea induced blue lunula is very rare. It is being reported in a 45-year-old man with chronic recalcitrant plaque psoriasis on oral hydroxyurea 500 mg twice daily. Lunular pigmentation in finger and toenails developed two weeks later. During follow up, pigmentation remained localized to the proximal portion of nails.

### Erythronychia [^ff540240]. Dermatologic Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Erythronychia is a term that covers a range of pathological patterns of red discoloration of the subungual tissues. The intensity of the red contrasts with the pale pink of the nail bed or the cream color of the lunula. It is typically due to one or more actors that include inflammation, vessel proliferation, and engorgement and focal thinning of the nail plate. This article describes the patterns both within an individual digit and when it extends to multiple digits. These patterns cover diverse inflammatory, infiltrative, and neoplastic diseases, and the correlation between these diagnoses and patterns is discussed alongside means of surgical diagnosis and cure.

The task apparatus was a specialized MR-compatible keyboard with four keys corresponding to two index fingers and two middle fingers. B Exemplar multidigit reaction time task trial procedure. i, At the beginning of each trial, when the buttons are not pressed with the corresponding fingers, all the cues are gray. ii, The cues turn white as soon as the corresponding buttons are pressed. iii, The setup is ready for a trial when all the buttons are pressed with their corresponding fingers. Participants have 1500 ms for this preparation, otherwise, the trial is considered "aborted". iv, After a randomly varying jitter time ranging from 400 to 500 ms, the stimuli are presented as blue finger(s), indicating the fingers that should be released as quickly and correctly as possible. v, If the participant releases incorrect finger(s), the corresponding cue(s) turn(s) red. vi, If the participant lifts the correct finger(s), the corresponding cue(s) turn(s) green. vii, A trial is not validated until the response is fully correct, that is, without any red cue on the screen. viii, As soon as the trial is validated, the green finger(s) turn back to gray. ix, Participants need to reposition all fingers and press the buttons to start a new trial. C Different stimulus modes and clusters: the 15 possible modes are grouped into 6 clusters (1 F, 2F-Homo, 2F-Ipsi, 2F-Diag, 3 F, and 4 F) based on the number of fingers to be recruited (1, 2, 3, or 4) and the coupling/decoupling interactions involved. D Timing and general procedures of each trial. In the SRT run, the participants had to execute the same movement in runs of 10 consecutive trials (no choice required). In the CRT run, the trials were presented in a pseudo-randomized order, thus, participants had to execute a different movement on each trial (choice required).

### Functional and cosmetic results of fingertip replantation: anastomosing only the digital artery [^b25f85cb]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

In fingertip amputations, conventional stump plasty provides an almost acceptable functional result. However, replanting fingertips can preserve the nail and minimize loss of function. We investigated the functional and cosmetic results of fingertip replantation at the terminal branch of the digital artery. Outcomes were nailbed width and distal-segment length; sensory recovery; and range of motion (ROM) of thumb-interphalangeal (IP) or finger-distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints, and total active motion (TAM) of the replanted finger. Of 15 fingertips replanted after only arterial anastomosis, 13 were successful, and 12 were studied. After a median of 1.3 years, mean nailbed widths and distal-segment lengths were 95.4% and 93.0%, respectively, of the contralateral finger. Average TAM and ROM of the thumb-IP or finger-DIP joints were 92.0% and 83.0% of normal, respectively. Semmes-Weinstein results were blue (3.22 to 3.61) in 4 fingers and purple (3.84 to 4.31) in 8; the mean result from the 2-point discrimination test was 5.9 mm (range, 3 to 11 mm). Thus, amputated fingertips should be aggressively replanted.

### Augmented manipulation ability in humans with six-fingered hands [^c0b22213]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

During each trial, the following additional visual feedback was presented to the subject. If no key was pressed, the target boxes were displayed in white. Pressing a key while no cursor was in the corresponding box, i.e. a false press, the target box turned red. Pressing a key while a cursor was in the corresponding box, i.e. correct press, the target box turned blue. Below the target boxes, two bars gave visual feedback about the subject's overall performance. The upper bar reflected the accuracy and the lower bar the error rate. If the accuracy of the subject increased, the accuracy bar filled up and vice versa. At the same time, decreasing the error results in filling of the error bar, such that an error rate equal to 0 resulted in an entirely filled bar, i.e. the value of 1-error rate was presented. Each bar was red until the subject crossed the set threshold of the corresponding bar, at which point it turned green. The threshold values were shown as gray markers on the bars. As soon as both bars turned green, a red countdown of 120 s appeared in the lower centre of the screen. If one bar turned red again before the time was expired, the countdown was reset to 120 s and disappeared until both bars were green again. Furthermore, each cursor individually appeared in red (if below) or green (if above) for the performance threshold in relation to the individual performance of the corresponding finger, so the subjects had an indication of which finger required improvement.

The evolution of performance is shown in Fig. 3h. Subjects were tested for five consecutive days as well as 10 days after. The subjects performed the task for 1 h per day. The subjects had to use two different finger combinations to press the keys; either all six fingers from the right hand or the right hand but replaced the SF with the index finger of the left hand (Fig. 3h).

Question 2: What is typically seen with histology?
A. Deposition of brown and black granules in the dermis
B. Hyperpigmentation of basal cell layer and pigment-laden macrophages in the dermis
C. Increased melanin deposit in the epidermis
D. More melanocytes than expected
E. Normal histology

Answers:
A. Deposition of brown and black granules in the dermis – Correct. Argyria shows a spared epidermis, helping distinguish it from other pigmentation disorders. The dermis will show many small brown or black granules along eccrine glands, elastic fibers, capillary walls, and nerves.
B. Hyperpigmentation of basal cell layer and pigment-laden macrophages in the dermis – Incorrect. Medications frequently cause hyperpigmentation and lead to these histological changes. Argyria does not cause epidermal changes and would show silver granules.
C. Increased melanin deposit in the epidermis – Incorrect. In addition to argyria's pigmentation being secondary to the photoactivation and metal reduction of silver, there is support of silver causing stimulation of melanin production. However, this is not the stereotypical histopathology of argyria.
D. More melanocytes than expected – Incorrect. Despite the evidence to support increased melanin production, there is no evidence of increased melanocytes in argyria.
E. Normal histology – Incorrect. A biopsy usually is sufficient to make the diagnosis of argyria due to characteristic changes. If clinical suspicion is high despite a negative biopsy, rebiopsy or using the noninvasive energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy, the gold standard, can be used.

### Chronic chilblains: the clinical presentation and disease course in a large paediatric series [^abb11fea]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

Children often present during winter with painful, red-purple swollen fingers and/or toes, usually misdiagnosed as Raynaud's phenomenon. Pernio, or chronic chilblains, is a localised inflammatory lesion of the skin resulting from an abnormal response to cold. The aim of this study was to better characterise the clinical presentation of chronic chilblains in children.

Methods

This is a single-centre retrospective study of patients referred to our paediatric rheumatology clinic with cold, purple, and painful hands. Patients were identified from the paediatric rheumatology clinic database, at the Safra Children Hospital, Israel. Data of the clinical presentation, physical findings, laboratory investigations and the course of the disease were extracted from the patients' charts and analysed.

Results

A total of 33 patients (27 females, sex ratio 4.5:1) were identified. Patients age at presentation was 13.5 ± 2.1, and disease duration was 2.0 ± 1.0 winters. Patients presented with prolonged capillary refill time (100%) and abnormal modified Allen test (75.6%). Fingers swelling was the most common finding (81.8%), followed by proximal interphalangeal joint (PIPs) swelling (63.6%), skin ulceration (54.5%), and dry, irritated skin (45.5%). Nailfold capillary microscopy was normal in all patients. The only abnormal laboratory test was the test for anti-nuclear factor (ANA) in 25%.

Conclusions

We report a large series of children with a unique symptomatology consisting in chronic chilblains.

### Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance associated with blue finger syndrome [^e929cf56]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

An 86-year-old Caucasian woman with a medical history of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) was admitted to the hospital with a chief complaint of sudden onset of bluish discolouration of the fifth left hand digit. On a physical examination, cyanosis of the fifth digit of the left hand was noticed with decreased capillary fill but no ulcers. The patient had no tenderness on palpation. Pulses were palpable over the radial arteries bilaterally. Patients with MGUS may be at increased risk of thromboembolic disease. A clear explanation for this association in these patients is not currently known. This case report highlights the association between MGUS and thromboembolic events, particularly blue finger syndrome.

### "Brain-reading" of perceived colors reveals a feature mixing mechanism underlying perceptual filling-in in cortical area V1 [^f902d4ba]. Human Brain Mapping (2010). Low credibility.

Visual filling-in occurs when a retinally stabilized object undergoes perceptual fading. As the term "filling-in" implies, it is commonly believed that information about the apparently vanished object is lost and replaced solely by information arising from the surrounding background. Here we report multivoxel pattern analysis fMRI data that challenge this long-held belief. When subjects view blue disks on a red background while fixating, the stimulus and background appear to turn a uniform purple upon perceptual fading, suggesting that a feature mixing mechanism may underlie color filling-in. We find that ensemble fMRI signals in retinotopic visual areas reliably predict (i) which of three colors a subject reports seeing; (ii) whether a subject is in a perceptually filled-in state or not; and (iii) furthermore, while subjects are in the perceptual state of filling-in, the BOLD signal activation pattern in the sub-areas of V1 corresponding to the location of the blue disks behaves as if subjects are in fact viewing a perceptually mixed color (purple), rather than the color of the disks (blue) or the color of the background (red). These results imply that the mechanism of filling-in in stimuli in which figure and background surfaces are equated is a process of "feature mixing", not "feature replacement". These data indicate that feature mixing may involve cortical areas as early as V1.

### A visually striking case of primary acrocyanosis: a rare cause of the blue digit [^54c8c10f]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Cold environments can trigger a variety of conditions, which, in their acute phase often present to the Emergency Department. Primary acrocyanosis is a distinct, rare condition which may be missed resulting in misdiagnosis and mismanagement. Primary acrocyanosis is a peripheral vascular disorder defined by painless, symmetrical discoloration of the distal appendages and uniquely characterized by persistence of the skin color changes after cold exposure. We present a case of a 24-year-old female who presented to the Emergency Department with peripheral cyanosis after cold exposure and was eventually diagnosed with primary acrocyanosis by Rheumatology. The prognosis for primary acrocyanosis is quite good in comparison to other acrosyndromes and once secondary causes of acrocyanosis have been ruled, out can be managed conservatively with lifestyle modifications and potential follow-up with Rheumatology.

2.2 Reconstitution and Administration for Injection of LUPRON DEPOT

Reconstitute and administer the lyophilized microsphere as a single IM injection as directed below. Visually inspect the drug product for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.
Inject the LUPRON DEPOT 3.75 mg suspension immediately or discard if not used within two hours as the suspension does not contain a preservative.

1. Visually inspect the LUPRON DEPOT 3.75 mg powder. Do not use the syringe if clumping or caking is evident. A thin layer of powder on the wall of the syringe is considered normal prior to mixing with the diluent. The diluent should appear clear.

2. To prepare for injection, screw the white plunger into the end stopper until the stopper begins to turn (see Figure A and Figure B).

Figure A:

Figure B:

3. Hold the syringe UPRIGHT. Release the diluent by SLOWLY PUSHING the plunger for 6 to 8 seconds until the first middle stopper is at the blue line in the middle of the barrel (see Figure C).

Figure C:

4. Keep the syringe upright. Mix the microsphere powder thoroughly by gently shaking the syringe until the powder forms a uniform suspension. The suspension will appear milky. If the powder adheres to the stopper or caking/clumping is present, tap the syringe with your finger to disperse. Do not use if any of the powder has not gone into suspension (see Figure D).

### Blue nail discoloration: literature review and diagnostic algorithms [^13df42c5]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Blue nail discoloration is a distinctive clinical presentation, and diagnosis is challenging given the broad differential diagnosis. A comprehensive review of the literature describing blue discoloration of one or multiple nails was performed using the PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. A total of 245 publications were included and grouped based on involvement of a single nail (monodactylic) or multiple nails (polydactylic). Monodactylic blue discoloration was associated with tumors or benign nevi, most commonly glomus tumors, followed by blue nevi and less commonly melanomas. Polydactylic blue discoloration was frequently associated with medications (such as minocycline, zidovudine, and hydroxyurea), toxic and exogenous exposures (such as silver), and other medical conditions (such as HIV/AIDS and systemic lupus erythematous). Patients presenting with blue nail discoloration warrant a thorough history, physical examination, and workup to rule out malignancy, systemic disease, or toxic exposure. We present diagnostic algorithms for monodactylic and polydactylic blue nail discoloration to guide workup and treatment plans.

Superposition on the RhoGAP domains. The p120RasGAP SH3 domain (purple) is shown as ribbon and transparent surface to highlight the overlap in binding sites. Inset: the SH3 domain RT loop is a close mimic of the switch I and switch II regions of the active (GTP-bound) conformation of RhoA. The location of the arginine finger Arg-1114 Ca is indicated as a sphere.

In more detail, the location of the SH3 interaction site suggests functional importance. It is well established that RhoGAP domains bind the GTP-loaded (active) conformation of Rho GTPases at a binding site that includes the switch I and switch II regions. Our analysis suggests that the SH3 domain RT loop overlaps with the RhoA switch I and switch II regions, indicating that the most extensive region of SH3 domain recognition corresponds with the most functionally relevant region of RhoA recognition (Fig. 3c). Notably, the arginine finger of the DLC1 RhoGAP domain is critical to both RhoA and SH3 binding (Fig. 3c).

### Fingertip replantation using artery-only anastomosis with a pulp tissue reduction method: a combination of pulp tissue reduction, bone fixation without gaps, and pinprick testing twice a day [^7fb596be]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In fingertip replantation with arterial anastomosis alone, many external bleeding techniques have been described to satisfy venous outflow, and some patients require blood transfusions. We used a pulp tissue reduction method to avoid the need for external bleeding techniques and blood transfusions.

Methods

We examined 18 fingers in cases of Ishikawa's subzone II, III, and IV amputation that were replanted with artery-only anastomosis and pulp tissue reduction from April 2003 to March 2018. The method consisted of pulp tissue reduction to the level of the fingerprint core, bone fixation without gaps to promote venous drainage through bone marrow, and pinprick testing twice a day. Prostaglandin E1 and/or urokinase were administered intravenously, but no other anticoagulants were used systemically or locally. Postoperatively, only the pinprick test was performed twice a day for 5 days.

Results

The patients ranged in age from 26 to 74 years (mean, 47 years). There were 13 men and 5 women. The total success rate was 89% (16/18). Of the 2 salvage failures, one was due to venous congestion and the other was due to arterial insufficiency. The survival rates of Ishikawa's subzone II, III, and IV amputation were 100% (4/4), 71% (5/7), and 100% (7/7), respectively. No blood transfusions were required in any of the cases. The Semmes-Weinstein test was performed for 14 of 18 fingers: the result was blue in 11 fingers and purple in 3 fingers.

Conclusions

The pulp tissue reduction method resulted in a high success rate without the need for external bleeding or blood transfusions. Fingertip replantation with artery-only anastomosis, a pulp tissue reduction method, is effective for replant survival when subcutaneous venous repair is impossible because a reduced pulp volume may facilitate replant survival under conditions of irregular venous drainage, such as bone marrow drainage.

### The color of skin: red diseases of the skin, nails, and mucosa [^1a1e4119]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Red color is pervasive in local and systemic skin conditions. It is a color that often reflects variations of dermal blood flow and extends beyond the rubor and calor of inflammation. The pathophysiology of red skin involves remote and local chemical mediators that dilate arteriolar smooth muscle and increase blood flow to superficial vessels and capillary beds. Incident light hits hemoglobin, which preferentially absorbs light of shorter wavelengths, such as blue, and reflects warmer colors. Due to its pervasiveness and consistency, red color is a useful descriptive factor in helping narrow a differential diagnosis. Red skin disorders include a variety of conditions involving endocrine mediators, cardiovascular responses, and the disruption of the skin barrier. An understanding of the blood's role in these disorders equips clinicians to generate differential diagnoses through the lens of pathophysiology. Dermatologists can improve management by considering red skin as part of systemic disease rather than as an isolated incident.

FIGURE 1
Numerical working memory manipulation task. Each trial began with an empty 4 × 1 grid with a blue fixation cross in the center presented for 1 s, followed by a 4 × 1 grid of single numerical digits (1–9) presented for 1.2 s (encoding). The digits then disappeared for 2.5 s (maintenance), and the underlying color of the grid became darker or lighter. The color indicated whether the participant was to maintain the original sequence, or rearrange the sequence into a numerically ascending order. After the 2.5 s, a 4 × 1 grid with a single probe digit was presented in any of the four boxes for 1.6 s (retrieval), and participants were tasked with responding (by button press) if the digit was in the correct box in the grid (right index finger) or not (right middle finger). It is important to note that the meaning of the light or dark color change was pseudorandomized between participants

### Minocycline-induced blue sclera and skin hyperpigmentation [^08c7a912]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 73-year-old man presented to the emergency department with lethargy and influenza-like symptoms. Incidentally, prominent blue sclera and blue-grey skin discolouration to the periorbital skin, pinnae, neck, upper and lower limbs, hands, feet, fingernails and toenails were noted. His general practitioner (GP) had previously ceased amiodarone, believing it to be the causative agent. A literature search confirms the side effects were likely due to minocycline, which the patient had been taking for 10 years. Long-term minocycline use is associated with scleral and skin hyperpigmentation, with no apparent adverse effect on ocular structure or function. The pigmentation may reverse with cessation of minocycline, or it may be permanent. Amiodarone may also cause skin hyperpigmentation, but scleral pigmentation is not a known association. This case report explores the side effect profiles of these two drugs, and highlights the potential for confusion regarding causative agents when used concurrently.

### The color of skin: blue diseases of the skin, nails, and mucosa [^d217665a]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Diseases of the skin, hair, nails and mucosa can appear as flesh-colored lesions or may present as any of the colors of the visual spectrum. Diseases associated with blue (or shades of blue) discoloration represent a unique group of conditions that occur de novo or as a reaction to either a topical or a systemic agent to which the individual has been exposed. Blue diseases can affect the skin, the nails or the mucosal membranes of the mouth (buccal mucosa, gingiva, lips, palate or tongue) or eyes (sclera). In addition to appearing blue, they can also appear as blue-black, blue-brown, blue-gray, blue-green, blue-purple, blue-red, and blue-silver. The conditions range from those secondary to exogenous agents (systemic or tattoo or topical) to syndromes to systemic diseases to tumors (adnexal, melanocytic, vascular, or miscellaneous). A comprehensive attempt to include all conditions that have been described as blue (or a shade of blue) has been performed by evaluating the following terms using the medical search engine PubMed: blue and either gingiva, lips, lunula, mucosa, nails, oral, palate, sclera, skin, or tongue. Subsequently, the conditions were organized by color (blue and shades of blue) and within each color by location (skin, nails, oral mucosa and sclera). The results are presented in organized tables; in addition, there is discussion of some of the conditions that are unique to one or more specific locations. In conclusion, 'preserve and cherish the pale blue dot' and remember that a big red rock eater with chrysiasis is the answer to the riddle, "What is big and blue and eats rocks?"

Raynaud's phenomenon has multiple etiologies, ranging from occupational causes to systemic disease. Most occupational causes of Raynaud's phenomenon usually present with vascular compromise.

Case Report

A 41-year-old Chinese woman presented to the emergency department with progressive pain and bluish discoloration over her right index finger after minor trauma. The clinical examination revealed discoloration over multiple fingertips on both hands. She was diagnosed with Raynaud's phenomenon with possible underlying systemic disease. Additional laboratory workup led to the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus with complex regional pain syndrome. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? It is rare for the emergency physician to diagnose Raynaud's phenomenon in the setting of minor trauma. It is important to diagnose this condition because of its potential complications.

### Treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon [^5adf19c3]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Raynaud's phenomenon is an episodic vasospasm of the peripheral arteries, causing pallor followed by cyanosis and redness with pain and sometimes paraesthesia, and, rarely, ulceration of the fingers and toes. Primary or idiopathic Raynaud's phenomenon (Raynaud's disease) occurs without an underlying disease. Secondary Raynaud's phenomenon (Raynaud's syndrome) occurs in association with an underlying disease. Initially conservative, non-pharmacologic approach is important for these patients, although pharmacologic therapy may ultimately be necessary. Advances in vascular physiology have showed the role of the endothelium as well as endothelium-independent mechanisms in the altered vasoregulation of Raynaud's phenomenon. This has opened promising therapeutic avenues, and it is likely that therapies targeted towards specific pathophysiologic steps become available in the near future.

### Artificially innervated self-healing foams as synthetic piezo-impedance sensor skins [^69494821]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Proximity and tactile pressure sensing

Intriguingly, AiFoam also can be used for proximity sensing. The fluorosurfactant and near-percolation μNi particles provide high dielectric permittivity values, enabling AiFoam to function well as a capacitive proximity sensor where the electrical field changes from the electrodes can be detected (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Movie 3). In contrast, a control sample of 25 vol% Ag nanoflakes (Ag Nfs) (see "Methods" and Supplementary Fig. 27) with high conductivity is not suitable for the proximity sensor (Supplementary Fig. 28). We measured the effect on the sensor capacitance versus the distance of the human finger to the AiFoam (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Fig. 29). The capacitance decreases as a human finger moves towards the sensor because the electric fields couple with the finger and reduces the effective capacitance between the 3D electrodes. When the finger contacts AiFoam and pressure was applied, the blue LED increased in intensity (Supplementary Movie 4) as resistance decreased with applied pressure (Fig. 6c). We demonstrated a simple circuit whereby both capacitance and resistance signal can be used for proximity sensing and pressure sensing, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 30).

Over the next 72 hours, there was a steady and marked improvement in both the appearance and function of all four limbs, more so in his hands than his feet. This seems to be the usual pattern reported in other cases. Milrinone was ceased after 24 hours, GTN was continued for 68 hours, and heparin was continued for 72 hours. Gabapentin and oxycodone made his pain bearable. At the time of ICU discharge, the patient's fingers were no longer purple, but they were still dusky and swollen (figure 1). Gangrenous demarcation was evident in both feet (figures 2 and 3).

### Blue nodule on the finger [^b27cb727]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Histologic diagnosis

Histologic findings confirmed a diagnosis of pencil-core granuloma (Fig 3).

Key message

This case displayed HBP by dermoscopy that resembled a blue nevus. HBP generally corresponds to dermal melanin granules of melanocytic tumors, such as blue nevus, but is also observed in hemangioma, dermatofibroma, and other nonmelanocytic tumors. Histopathologic examination found that the HBP in this case was caused by the dermal deposition of graphite and graphite accumulation within macrophages. Several cases of pencil-core granuloma have been reported to exhibit HBP on dermoscopy, with a history of embedded pencil-tip graphite at the site representing a clue for correct diagnosis. However, melanoma could not be completely excluded in this case because of the dermoscopic finding of dotted vessels and the rapid size increase of the tumor. Close attention is necessary for nodular melanoma, as it frequently shows a symmetrical pigmentation pattern without pigment network. Pencil-core granulomas may suddenly develop long after the initial trauma, presumably because of delayed granulomatous reactions towards the graphite, clay, wax, and other components of pencil cores.

### Supramodal and cross-modal representations of working memory in higher-order cortex [^365e3024]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Experimental procedure

In the experiment, participants performed four working memory tasks in separate runs, inside the fMRI scanner with the tactile stimuli delivery system for about 2 h. The four tasks were two within-modal tasks (tactile-to-tactile task, TT, and visual-to-visual task, VV) and two cross-modal working memory tasks (tactile-to-visual task, TV, and visual-to-tactile task, VT), designed based on the delayed-match-to-sample task paradigm (Fig. 1a).

Prior to the working memory tasks, the participants were familiarized with the pTDS and tactile braille stimuli, to reduce the gap between recognition difficulties of tactile and visual stimuli and to obtain stable patterns. During this familiarization, participants were asked to touch and recognize each braille stimulus with their right index finger. In each trial, a yellow fixation cross indicated the onset of the trial. When the fixation cross turned red ("Finger-in" cue) 1.5 s after the trial onset, the participants were asked to insert their right index finger in the entrance hole to touch a braille stimulus. The finger movement was detected by a light sensor. When the fixation cross changed to blue ("Finger-out" cue), 1.5 s after the detection of touching the braille stimulus, they were instructed to withdraw their finger from the hole. The maximum allowed duration between the "Finger-in" cue and finger detection by the sensor, or between the "Finger-out" cue and finger withdrawal detection by the sensor, was 1.5 s. If finger insertion was not detected within the duration, the next trial of the task restarted. If finger withdrawal was not detected within the maximum duration, the "Finger-out" cue, a blue fixation cross, was switched to a blue square as a warning for the participant to remove their finger. This familiarization task consisted of 2 runs of 20 trials, and two additional trials (one per each run) of delayed-match-to-sample task, which were the same as that of the tactile-to-tactile (TT) working memory task explained in detail below (Supplementary Fig. 1a). The order of the stimuli was randomized, and the number of exposures to each stimulus was counterbalanced across runs.

### Out of the blue finger ischaemia and occult colorectal cancer [^9e6c849d]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A woman aged 66 years with a history of unprovoked deep venous thrombosis (DVT) presented with persistent digital ischaemic changes of 2 of her right hand fingers. Physical examination was otherwise normal and extensive laboratory and imaging studies were unremarkable. A history of unprovoked DVT and the current episode of digital ischaemia prompted concern for underlying occult malignancy. Repeated history-taking revealed a strongly positive family history suggesting an occult colorectal cancer. Colonoscopy with biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma. Adenocarcinoma of the colon has rarely been associated with paraneoplastic acral vascular syndrome. This report suggests that occult malignancy needs to be considered in patients with focal digital ischaemia as this association is poorly unrecognised.

### Propylthiouracil [^3e6c347b]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

What should I avoid while taking Propylthiouracil?

Propylthiouracil can cause dizziness, drowsiness or sleepiness. If you have these symptoms do not drive, operate machinery, or do other dangerous activities until you know how Propylthiouracil affects you.

What are the possible side effects of Propylthiouracil?

Propylthiouracil may cause serious side effects, including:

See "What is the most important information I should know about Propylthiouracil?"
Low white blood cell counts.
This usually happens within the first 3 months of treatment and can be life-threatening. You may have a higher chance of getting an infection when your white blood cell count is low.
Call your doctor right away if you have symptoms of infection or illness such as fever, chills, or sore throat.
Swelling (inflammation) of the small blood vessels of the body (vasculitis). Some people have developed vasculitis, a serious complication, during their treatment with Propylthiouracil that can lead to death. Vasculitis can involve the small blood vessels of the skin, kidneys, or lungs. Symptoms may vary depending on which blood vessels are affected. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you develop changes in your:
skin, such as red or purple changes in color, a rash, pain, or swelling,
urine, such as pink or dark in color, looks foamy, decrease in the amount produced, or
breathing, such as shortness of breath or coughing up blood.
Increased risk of bleeding. You may have increased bleeding especially if you have surgery or if you are taking blood thinners.
Hypothyroidism (low thyroid problems). Your doctor should do blood tests regularly during treatment to check your thyroid.
Severe skin reactions (Stevens Johnson syndrome). Propylthiouracil may cause rare, but serious skin reactions that may require stopping its use. This may need to be treated in a hospital and may be life-threatening. Call your doctor right away or get emergency help if you have skin blisters, peeling rash, sores in the mouth, hives or any other allergic reactions.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^856ade99]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Fractures — first aid recommendations and rationale: If a fracture is associated with an open wound and severe bleeding, the First Aid for Severe External Bleeding and First Aid for Life-Threatening Extremity Bleeding That Is Not Controlled by Direct Pressure recommendations should be followed (1 C-EO). If a fractured extremity is blue, purple, or pale, the emergency response system should be activated immediately (1 C-EO). Splinting of a fractured extremity can be useful to reduce pain, reduce risk for further injury, and facilitate transport to a medical facility (2a C-EO). It may be reasonable to treat a deformed fractured extremity in the position found unless straightening the fracture is necessary to facilitate safe and prompt transport to a medical facility (2b C-EO). Covering open wounds associated with a suspected fracture with a clean dressing may be useful to lower the risk for contamination or infection (2b C-EO). Long-bone fractures and open fractures can cause substantial and possibly life-threatening blood loss, and blue, purple, or pale extremities may indicate poor perfusion to the extremity, a limb-threatening injury for which professional medical care should be sought immediately. There is a lack of evidence demonstrating clear benefits from fracture splinting in the prehospital first aid setting; however, fracture immobilization is an essential part of definitive fracture treatment, and splinting as a first aid measure may be helpful to reduce pain, prevent further injury, and facilitate transport. Splinting an injured extremity in the position found is accepted first aid practice.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^64fcdea6]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Frostbite background — frostbite is a condition that results from the freezing of skin and, in severe cases, underlying tissues, in which the formation of ice crystals within the cells causes cellular and tissue damage. The extremities — fingers, toes, nose, and ears — are particularly susceptible to frostbite, and the severity ranges from superficial frostbite affecting only the outer layers of the skin to more severe cases involving deeper tissues. Symptoms include numbness, tingling, pain, and changes in skin color, and in extreme cases frostbite can cause tissue necrosis leading to digit or limb loss.

### Raynaud's phenomenon: current concepts [^32c8179e]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) is a transient, acral, vasospastic phenomenon that manifests with characteristic color changes. This vasospasm, classically triggered by cold temperatures, may also be driven by shifts in temperature, climate, or emotional state. Primary RP (PRP) is a common condition without severe sequelae. Secondary RP (SRP), which may be driven by vascular, autoimmune, hematologic, or endocrine etiologies, can result in digital ulceration, irreversible ischemia and necrosis, and secondary infection. This review delineates the clinical manifestations of both primary and secondary RP, as well as the current understanding of RP epidemiology and pathogenesis. Proper examination, including nailfold capillary microscopy, and laboratory workup for secondary causes of RP are also discussed. The traditional armamentarium of therapies used for RP, as well as newer medical and surgical options, is also summarized with particular regard to the clinical evidence for their efficacy.

### Severe Raynaud's phenomenon from ethosuximide raised concern over possible onset of systemic vasculitis: a case report [^3ec8c734]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Ethosuximide and other anti-epileptic drugs have been reported to cause idiosyncratic reactions such as lupus-like syndromes, with elevated antinuclear antibody (ANA) levels. Herein, we present a case of a girl who developed a very severe Raynaud's phenomenon reaction and anti-Scl-70 antibodies related to treatment with ethosuximide, due to juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE).

Case presentation

A 12-year-old girl was diagnosed with JAE and treatment with ethosuximide was initiated. Two and a half months later her fingers, digits II–V bilaterally, began to ache and were discolored, alternatingly white, blue, or normal-colored. Two weeks later, her fingers were bluish-black, aching severely, almost continuously. The family sought medical advice. Ethosuximide was halted and due to the severe symptoms, treatment with both prednisolone and intravenous iloprost was commenced. Laboratory tests revealed high ANA levels with anti-Scl-70 pattern and confirmed anti-Scl-70 antibodies. After a few weeks, she started to improve and the symptoms slowly decreased over five months. Anti-Scl-70 was still detectable four months after onset of symptoms, though she was much improved. After eleven months, repeated ANA analyses were completely negative.

Conclusion

Although extremely rare, it is important to recognize that severe Raynaud's phenomenon, threatening peripheral digital circulation, may occur as an idiosyncratic reaction to ethosuximide, raising concern over possible onset of vasculitis.

### Highly variable clinical feature and course of aggressive digital papillary adenocarcinoma [^6ec3ac9c]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Aggressive digital papillary adenocarcinoma (ADPA) is a rare cutaneous tumor with sweat gland differentiation. Due to the high risk of local recurrence and delayed metastasis, the wide local resection of the primary lesion and long-term follow up are recommended for ADPA. Here, we report two cases of ADPA. Case 1 had a blue-gray nodule on the tip of the right middle finger. Case 2 had had a papule on the dorsal side of the left ring finger for 13 years. In both cases, papillary proliferations of the tumor cells showed multilobular adenomatous structures with back-to-back patterns characteristic of ADPA. We amputated the finger at the proximal interphalangeal joint and performed a wide resection of the primary tumor in Case 1 and 2, respectively. Sentinel lymph node biopsy in the axilla was performed, and no sentinel lymph node metastasis was found in either case. Among the previously reported ADPA cases, clinically, most lesions were skin-colored or tan-brown to gray. The blue-gray color in Case 1 is thought to be extraordinary for ADPA. In Case 2, the patient had had the small lesion for more than 13 years and the tumor size had been stable during that long period. The present two cases suggest that ADPA shows a prominent variety of both clinical features and disease courses, and that we cannot exclude the possibility of ADPA even in cases of blue-gray nodules or small, stable, non-progressive papules.

### Orange-brown chromonychia and Kawasaki disease: a possible novel association? [^88c06e83]. Pediatric Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

A 4-year-old girl with clinical and laboratory signs of Kawasaki disease (KD) was hospitalized and given intravenous immunoglobulin plus aspirin therapy, with rapid defervescence and clinical improvement, and was discharged 48 hours after admission. At the time of her follow-up echocardiography on day 14, orange-brown pigmentation of the nail beds was noticed and confirmed with dermoscopy. No clear association between KD and orange-brown chromonychia has been demonstrated, although reports and case series suggest a possible link between these two entities. We suggest that this particular finding might be encompassed in late (subacute) changes of extremities as part of KD diagnostic criteria.

### Middle-aged female with blue nails and graying skin [^6d90e49b]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Case

A 60-year-old female presented for her nail beds becoming blue over the past 3 years. Additionally, it was noted her sun exposed skin had a gray discoloration (Fig 1). She was healthy, review of systems was negative, and had no pertinent family history. She denied any prescribed medications but reported taking multivitamins and angstrom silver, both of which she took regularly for 10 years. A punch biopsy was done and confirmed the diagnosis (Fig 2).

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Melasma
B. Wilson's disease
C. Argyria
D. Addison's disease
E. Vitamin deficiency

Answers:
A. Melasma – Incorrect. Melasma is hyperpigmentation localized to the face and is common in women. It should be considered in this case especially if she had been taking hormone replacement. Additionally, melasma does not cause blue discoloration of the nails.
B. Wilson's disease – Incorrect. Wilson's disease can lead to hyperpigmentation, but this is unlikely in our patient. She was healthy, had a negative review of systems, and had an unremarkable exam besides pigmentation changes. In Wilson's disease, we would expect patients to be positive for symptoms related to liver dysfunction including abdominal pain, lack of appetite, and fatigue.
C. Argyria – Correct. She developed argyria, a rare dermatologic condition due to exposure or ingestion of silver. Generalized argyria, in comparison to localized argyria, typically results from ingesting colloidal silver. Despite the superiority of antibiotics, silver is still taken as a homeopathic antimicrobial. This case is unique as the patient was taking angstrom silver, which is 1 million times smaller than colloidal, and has not previously been reported to cause argyria.
D. Addison's disease – Incorrect. Addison's disease, primary adrenal insufficiency, can lead to hyperpigmentation typically at scars, pressure points, mucous membranes, and skin folds. This is unlikely as she denied the typical systemic symptoms including fatigue, weakness, appetite decrease, and polydipsia.
E. Vitamin deficiency – Incorrect. Vitamin deficiencies can lead to pigment changes; however, this is doubtful in our patient. She had no history of gastrointestinal absorption issues, ate well, and took multivitamins.

### A dialysis patient with subungual hyperkeratosis and ulceration of the fingertips [^7984799a]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 3: What is the next best step in management?
A. Surgical debridement
B. Referral to pain management
C. Referral to vascular surgery
D. Oral nifedipine
E. Compression and elevation of the affected limb

Answers:
A. Surgical debridement – Incorrect. Although the debridement of the hyperkeratotic material at the fingertips may be needed in the future, without an intervention to restore adequate blood flow, the ischemia is likely to progress, and the ulcers will recur.
B. Referral to pain management – Incorrect. Managing this patient's pain without correcting the underlying cause is not the optimal treatment.
C. Referral to vascular surgery – Correct. Several percutaneous and surgical treatment options exist for DASS, with varying degrees of evidence for each method. Catheter angiography can be performed, with angioplasty of distal atherosclerotic disease or the insertion of a coil to decrease flow rates. Surgical options including plication, banding, and clipping of the AVF to decrease shunting and restore distal flow in high-flow lesions. Recently, distal revascularization with interval ligation has become the preferred procedure for most cases of DASS. Most vascular surgeons are able to perform both percutaneous and open surgical procedures for DASS. The patient underwent banding of the fistula, with improvement in distal angiographic flow.
D. Oral nifedipine – Incorrect. Nifedipine is sometimes used to treat Raynaud syndrome, because it causes vasodilation and may prevent attacks. Decreasing arterial pressure in this case may make the patient's symptoms worse.
E. Compression and elevation of the affected limb – Incorrect. Compression and elevation of an extremity that is not adequately perfused risks making the problem worse. Interestingly, this patient had noticeable pallor of her left hand when it was raised above her head (Fig 4).

### Part I: epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical considerations of primary and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon [^3e385dca]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) is a relatively common disease with both primary and secondary forms. It is well understood as a vasospastic condition affecting the acral and digital arteries, resulting in characteristic, well-demarcated color changes typically in the hands and feet in response to cold or stress. Secondary RP (SRP) has been described in association with a variety of rheumatologic and nonrheumatologic diseases, environmental exposures, and/or medications. While both primary RP and SRP may impact the quality of life, SRP may lead to permanent and potentially devastating tissue destruction when undiagnosed and untreated. It is therefore crucial for dermatologists to distinguish between primary and secondary disease forms early in clinical evaluation, investigate potential underlying causes, and risk stratify SRP patients for the development of associated autoimmune connective tissue disease. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical presentation and diagnosis of both forms of RP are described in detail in this review article.

### Appropriate use of drug testing in clinical addiction medicine [^618d976f]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Urine sample integrity — collection and facility practices — emphasizes that urine should be considered the matrix most prone to tampering and that collection methods should protect dignity and privacy while minimizing opportunities for tampering. Observed sample collection can deter tampering and, if there are concerns, collection should be observed by a same‑gender staff member, though observed collection does not completely prevent tampering and providers should consider other mitigation strategies. Providers should consider unobtrusive collection methods for patients with a history of psychological trauma, employ facility measures to decrease tampering during unobserved collection, not allow personal items in the collection area, and consider placing blue dye in the toilet and turning off the water source during collection. If a provider suspects ongoing substance use despite negative tests, sample collection should be observed and specimen validity testing conducted; if a sample is suspected of tampering, it should be tested for specimen validity including creatinine concentration, pH level, specific gravity and adulterants, and all samples undergoing definitive testing should be tested for creatinine concentration, pH level and specific gravity if creatinine is low.

Functional outcomes of cubital tunnel surgery may decline as the severity of preoperative ulnar neuropathy increases. When functional recovery will be adequate, or whether tendon transfers should be required, may be unclear. We investigated the extent of functional recovery, the duration of the recovery process, and the necessity of restoring intrinsic muscle function in patients with severe cubital tunnel syndrome after surgery.

Methods

We retrospectively studied outcomes after cubital tunnel release in 15 patients with marked intrinsic muscle atrophy, claw-hand deformity, immeasurable (electrically silent) sensory and motor nerve conduction velocities, and Semmes-Weinstein test (SWT) results ranging from purple (3.84–4.31) to red (4.56–6.65). We evaluated subjective (numbness and activities of daily living [ADL] disturbances), objective (manual muscle testing [MMT] of index-finger abduction, and SWT), and neurophysiologic (nerve conduction velocity) outcomes. Overall functional outcome was evaluated by Akahori's criteria.

Results

At a median follow-up evaluation of 4.5 years all outcomes had improved. Numbness was gone in 5 patients and greatly reduced in 9 patients; 6 patients reported slight difficulties in ADLs; and 9 patients had no difficulties. Motor nerve conduction velocity was measurable (mean, 35.3 m/s) in all 15 patients and sensory nerve conduction velocity was measurable (mean, 43.4 m/s) in 12. Recoveries in nerve conduction velocities persisted beyond 2 years. The SWT results were blue (3.22–3.61) in 6 patients, purple (3.84–4.31) in 8 patients, and red (4.56–6.65) in 1 patient. MMT of index finger abduction was grade 4 or 5 in 11 of 15 patients. Half the patients over 70 years old, however, were grade 3 or less. Akahori's criteria were excellent in 3 patients, good in 6 patients, and fair in 6 patients.

Conclusions

Patients with severe intrinsic muscle atrophy and absent motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities can expect satisfactory long-term functional results after surgery. Function continues to improve beyond 2 years. Restoring index finger abduction is not always necessary for ADLs, although recovery requires several years and is poorer in the elderly.

The ulnar nerve is shown. The most common entrapment neuropathies of the ulnar nerve are the cubital tunnel syndrome at the elbow, and the ulnar tunnel syndrome at the wrist

Fig. 15
Cases of ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow are illustrated. a Axial PDFS elbow in 50-year-old female with ulnar nerve neuropathy. The ulnar nerve (white arrow) returns increased signal intensity at the level of the cubital tunnel and is focally enlarged. b Sagittal PDFS elbow of a 54-year-old male with ulnar neuropathy. The ulnar nerve is enlarged (white arrow), with compression as it enters between the two flexor carpi ulnaris heads (blue arrows). c Axial PD elbow of a 60-year-old male showing the normal variant anconeus epitrochlearis (blue arrow) superficial to the ulnar nerve (white arrow) at the cubital tunnel. This can predispose to ulnar nerve entrapment

Digital nerves arise from the radial, median and ulnar nerves. They are divided into palmar and dorsal branches and provide sensory and motor supply to the distal fingers. Injury to the digital nerves impairs hand dexterity and causes numbness and/or pain which radiates down the fingers. They are most commonly damaged by trauma (including surgical as shown in Fig. 17), but other causes of entrapment include inflammation, vascular malformations and neoplasms.

Fig. 17
Ultrasound thumb in patient with right thumb pain post trigger finger release. There is fusiform enlargement of the digital nerve (blue arrows) palmar-radial to the site of the prior A1 pulley release, extending over a length of 5 mm. Sonographic palpation elicited the usual symptom of pain radiating down the thumb. There is an echogenic focus (white arrow) immediately superficial to the nerve which may represent suture material (or calcification). This is consistent with entrapment given the proximity to the site of prior intervention

### Prevalence, risk factors and associations of primary Raynaud's phenomenon: systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies [^c2d72f78]. BMJ Open (2015). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Raynaud's phenomenon:

- **Definition**: RP is a vasospastic disorder that results in characteristic, triphasic changes in skin color occurring in response to various external triggers, including exposure to cold.
- **Pathophysiology**: RP may be idiopathic in origin (primary RP), or occur in the context of connective tissue diseases (secondary RP), such as systemic sclerosis, dermatomyositis, SLE, Sjögren's syndrome, mixed connective tissue disease, or undifferentiated connective tissue disease.
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the prevalence of primary RP is estimated at 4.85% (95% CI, 2.08–8.71%), while the pooled annual incidence is estimated at 0.25% (95% CI, 0.19–0.32%).
- **Disease course**: In patients with RP, exposure to cold triggers intense sympathetic vasoconstriction in skin areas bearing specialized arterio-venous anastomoses that normally contribute to thermoregulation (fingers, toes, nose, and ear tip). In patients with secondary RP, abnormal endothelial function increases the risk of ischemic complications.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Severe disease may progress to digital ulcerations, necrosis, and self-amputation.

### ABM clinical protocol # 26: persistent pain with breastfeeding [^8097919b]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Vasospasm of the nipple — presentation and risk features include color change and cold sensitivity. Vasospasm presents with blanching or purple color changes of the nipple accompanied by sharp, shooting, or burning pain, and may be triggered after breastfeeding, after a warm shower, or by cold temperatures such as in the frozen food section of the grocery store. Symptoms may be bilateral or unilateral with current or past nipple trauma; mothers may report cold hands and feet or a diagnosis of Raynaud's syndrome, and those with connective tissue disorders (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) or prior Raynaud's are at risk for vasospasm of the nipple.

Scabies — clinical presentation features include a generalized or regional pruritic papular rash with erythema, abundant excoriations, and secondarily infected pustules, typically in a regionally symmetric pattern. Commonly involved sites include the volar wrists and finger web spaces, with the left and right sides usually involved in a nearly identical fashion; boys and men often develop nodular lesions on the scrotum and penis. When considering scabies in any male older than 2 years, a genital examination can be extremely helpful, and scabies burrows are short, delicate, linear lesions that involve the most superficial part of the epidermis; burrows are pathognomonic but challenging to detect.

### Mottled Raynaud's phenomenon and hand-arm vibration syndrome: followed up for 10 years [^65bca9a5]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Background

Hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS) is a common but underdiagnosed occupational disease caused by the use of handheld vibrating tools.HAVS has three components, namely, peripheral circulation, nerves and the musculoskeletal system. The circulatory disorder, also known as vibration white finger (VWF), is a form of secondary Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) and the most well-established manifestation of HAVS. The more advanced stages of HAVS result in disability at work and reduced quality of life. The prevalence of RP ranges from 2% in temperate regions to 16% in cold climates. RP is a common vasospasm condition (primary RP).

RP may develop secondary to a variety of underlying conditions, including drugs, connective tissue disorders, and environmental agents and injuries such as HAVS (secondary RP). Secondary RP accounts for 10%–20% of all cases of RP.RP is triggered by cold exposure, emotional stressors, tobacco smoke and so on. Cold stimulation activates α2-adrenergic receptors in vascular smooth muscle, resulting in cutaneous blood vessel spasms.

RP is classically manifested as triphasic colour changes: white/pallor due to vasoconstriction, blue/cyanosis due to sequestration of deoxygenated blood and red due to reperfusion and hyperaemia. However, all the three-colour changes are rarely visible to the patient or clinician. A rare phenomenon in which three-colour changes can be recognised continuously in a short time is defined as 'mottled' RP. 'Mottled' RP has been known empirically, but no photographic reports have been published on continuous observation from the onset to the disappearance of RP.

We present a rare case of 'mottled' RP and HAVS. The cold-water immersion test was performed on the hands to confirm the diagnosis of VWF. However, RP rarely appeared during the examination. Additionally, whole-body cold exposure, which is more sensitive than partial exposure to cold, was performed.

Treatment of fistula complications — hand ischemia staging and evaluation outlines staged presentation and initial assessment as follows: "Stage I, pale/blue and/or cold hand without pain; Stage II, pain during exercise and/or HD; Stage III, pain at rest; Stage IV, ulcers/necrosis/gangrene". It is important to "differentiate the findings of hand ischemia from those of carpal tunnel compression syndrome, tissue acidosis, and edema from venous hypertension", and "Noninvasive evaluation should be performed, including digital blood pressure measurement, DDU, and — if available — transcutaneous oxygen measurement". For monomelic ischemic neuropathy, "immediate closure of the AVF is mandatory".

Table 17 — summary of physical examination outlines that inspection should examine for erythema, swelling, gangrene, and change of size of aneurysms over time; palpation should feel for intravascular pressure along the veins, examine for segmental differences in quality, assess skin temperature and pulsation along arteries and veins, and check for pain caused by finger pressure; auscultation should check for the presence of typical low-frequency bruit with systolic and diastolic components and examine for abnormal high-frequency bruit produced by turbulence due to a stenosis.
