## Question

Should we check lipoprotein A-levels on all of our adult patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether we should check lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] levels on all adult patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the strength and consistency of guideline recommendations across societies. Then, I should verify the epidemiologic and genetic evidence supporting universal screening. Next, I will examine how Lp(a) meaningfully changes management and whether that justifies screening. After that, I need to check assay standardization and practical implementation issues. Finally, I will consider exceptions, cost-effectiveness, and synthesize a balanced recommendation with clear thresholds and next steps.

> Let me first confirm the guideline landscape, because that frames the answer. Multiple high-credibility societies now recommend measuring Lp(a) at least once in adulthood: the National Lipid Association (NLA) explicitly recommends universal adult screening with risk stratification thresholds, the European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society (ESC/EAS) recommends a once-in-a-lifetime measurement in all adults, and the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) includes Lp(a) in initial lipid screening, while the AHA/ACC historically endorsed selective testing but increasingly recognize Lp(a) as a risk enhancer in borderline/intermediate risk patients, reflecting a shift toward broader testing [^d03224b7] [^ac8f904b] [^892a71e9] [^a12360fc].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence supporting universal screening rather than just assuming it helps. Lp(a) is a genetically determined, independent, and causal risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and calcific aortic valve disease, with risk rising continuously across the concentration range and persisting even when LDL-C is well controlled, which strengthens the case for at least one lifetime measurement to identify high-risk individuals who would otherwise be missed by traditional risk scores [^cd2b242a] [^e333edd3] [^c018e33c].

> I should confirm prevalence and magnitude of risk to ensure clinical relevance. Elevated Lp(a), commonly defined as ≥ 50 mg/dL or ≥ 125 nmol/L, affects roughly 20% of adults globally, and higher Lp(a) is associated with approximately a 40% higher ASCVD risk per 50 mg/dL increment, with very high levels (> 180 mg/dL or > 430 nmol/L) conferring lifetime risk comparable to heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, underscoring the public health impact of identifying these patients [^e6750209] [^881a528e] [^ac8f904b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about testing without linking it to actionable management. I need to check how knowing Lp(a) changes care. When Lp(a) is elevated, guidelines support more aggressive LDL-C lowering, consideration of PCSK9 inhibitors for additional LDL-C and modest Lp(a) reduction, and cascade screening of first-degree relatives; in select high-risk patients with refractory elevations, lipoprotein apheresis is FDA-approved to reduce Lp(a), and emerging antisense/siRNA therapies are in phase 3 outcomes trials, so testing today positions patients to benefit from evolving targeted therapies [^d03224b7] [^c307be2a] [^01ea91f7] [^622ed2a1].

> Next, I should review assay and implementation issues, because poor standardization undermines clinical uptake. I need to ensure we recommend molar concentration (nmol/L) using isoform-insensitive assays calibrated to WHO/IFCC reference material, avoid converting mg/dL to nmol/L with fixed factors, and avoid correcting LDL-C for Lp(a)-cholesterol, as these practices introduce error; despite these challenges, real-world data show testing rates remain very low (< 1% in many systems), highlighting a need for education, EMR prompts, and harmonized reporting to close the gap [^d8f4e538] [^958232a8] [^1f854a53] [^cc7f2cf1].

> But wait, what if universal screening is not feasible in resource-limited settings? I should double-check prioritization. Even where universal testing is aspirational, targeted testing is reasonable in patients with premature ASCVD, family history of premature ASCVD or elevated Lp(a), suspected or confirmed familial hypercholesterolemia, recurrent events despite optimal therapy, or ancestry with higher median Lp(a) (e.g. African or South Asian descent), and these groups should be prioritized while systems work toward broader implementation [^86b3e7dd] [^e0310635].

> I will now examine cost-effectiveness and practical considerations. Because Lp(a) is genetically determined and relatively stable over life, a single measurement suffices for most adults, and early identification of high Lp(a) can drive more intensive prevention that may reduce downstream cardiovascular events and costs; while formal cost-effectiveness models vary, the low cost of a one-time test and the high prevalence of elevation support population screening once standardization and education are addressed [^3289b3a4] [^ebe5ac2a].

> Let me reconsider any counterarguments. Some guidelines still frame Lp(a) as a risk enhancer rather than mandating universal screening, and there remains uncertainty about the exact Lp(a)-lowering threshold that reduces events until outcomes trials complete; however, the balance of evidence and the momentum of society endorsements, coupled with the minimal harm of a single nonfasting blood draw, favor universal screening with clear management pathways [^a12360fc] [^e333edd3] [^d03224b7].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Yes, we should check Lp(a) at least once in all adults, ideally using a standardized molar assay reported in nmol/L, with risk stratification at < 75 nmol/L (low), 75–124 nmol/L (intermediate), and ≥ 125 nmol/L (high), and then act on elevated results with more aggressive LDL-C lowering, consideration of PCSK9 inhibitors, cascade screening of relatives, and, in select high-risk cases, lipoprotein apheresis, while recognizing that emerging Lp(a)-specific therapies may soon expand options [^d03224b7] [^c307be2a] [^01ea91f7] [^622ed2a1].

---

Routine Lp(a) testing is **recommended at least once in adulthood** [^d03224b7] by major societies (NLA, ESC/EAS, CCS) because elevated Lp(a) is a **genetically determined, independent risk factor** [^cd2b242a] for ASCVD and calcific aortic valve disease [^e333edd3], and is present in ~20% of the population [^e6750209]. Testing is especially important in those with premature ASCVD, family history, or suspected familial hypercholesterolemia [^e0310635], and results can refine risk and guide more aggressive LDL-C lowering [^e9ef7f2e] and family screening [^d03224b7]. Assays should be standardized [^958232a8] and reported in nmol/L [^d8f4e538]; repeat testing is generally unnecessary unless results are intermediate or clinical context changes [^4af0d66f]. While evidence supports universal testing, some guidelines still endorse selective use; nonetheless, the balance favors a **once-in-a-lifetime measurement** [^d03224b7] given its prevalence and prognostic value [^e6750209].

---

## Rationale for routine Lp(a) testing

- **Genetic determinism and stability**: Lp(a) levels are ~70–90% genetically determined [^cd2b242a] and remain relatively stable throughout life, making a single measurement informative for lifetime risk [^ce1c4766].

- **Prevalence and risk**: Elevated Lp(a) (≥ 50 mg/dL or ≥ 125 nmol/L) affects ~20% of the global population [^e6750209] and independently increases ASCVD risk [^cd2b242a], including myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral artery disease [^e6750209].

- **Calcific aortic valve disease**: Elevated Lp(a) is causally linked to calcific aortic valve stenosis [^e333edd3], supporting its assessment for comprehensive cardiovascular risk evaluation [^e333edd3].

## Current guideline recommendations

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| National Lipid Association (NLA) | Measure Lp(a) at least once in adulthood (≥ 18 years) [^d03224b7] to refine ASCVD risk assessment [^8021d83a] |
| European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society (ESC/EAS) | Measure Lp(a) at least once in adulthood [^ac8f904b] to identify individuals with very high Lp(a) (> 180 mg/dL or > 430 nmol/L) [^ac8f904b] |
| Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) | Include Lp(a) measurement once in a lifetime as part of initial lipid screening [^892a71e9] |
| American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) | Consider Lp(a) measurement in individuals with a family history of premature ASCVD or personal history of ASCVD not explained by major risk factors [^a12360fc] |

## Clinical scenarios warranting Lp(a) testing

While universal testing is recommended, **certain scenarios particularly benefit** from Lp(a) measurement:

- **Premature ASCVD**: Individuals with cardiovascular events before age 55 in men or 65 in women [^e0310635].

- **Family history**: Premature ASCVD or known elevated Lp(a) in first-degree relatives [^e0310635].

- **Familial hypercholesterolemia**: Suspected or confirmed FH [^e0310635].

- **Recurrent events**: ASCVD events despite optimal LDL-C lowering [^e0310635].

- **High-risk ancestry**: Individuals of African or South Asian descent, who have higher median Lp(a) levels [^86b3e7dd].

---

## Clinical implications of elevated Lp(a) levels

Elevated Lp(a) levels **warrant intensified risk factor management**:

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Emphasize diet, exercise, and smoking cessation [^66aed053].

- **Aggressive LDL-C lowering**: Intensify statin therapy, consider ezetimibe, and PCSK9 inhibitors [^c307be2a] [^7552d23a].

- **Family screening**: Cascade screening of first-degree relatives to identify additional at-risk individuals [^d03224b7].

- **Specialized therapies**: Lipoprotein apheresis for very high-risk patients with refractory elevated Lp(a) [^d03224b7].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Assay standardization**: Variability between assays exists; use standardized assays calibrated to WHO/IFCC reference material [^958232a8] and report in nmol/L [^d8f4e538].

- **Limited specific therapies**: Currently, there are no widely available therapies specifically targeting Lp(a), though several are in development [^622ed2a1].

- **Cost and access**: Testing costs and limited access may hinder widespread implementation [^9e09ec91].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendation

Routine Lp(a) testing at least once in adulthood is **supported by major guidelines** and the evidence base, given its genetic determinism, prevalence, and independent association with ASCVD and calcific aortic valve disease [^d03224b7] [^ac8f904b] [^892a71e9]. Testing refines risk stratification, guides aggressive LDL-C lowering, and enables family screening. Assays should be standardized [^958232a8], and results interpreted within the clinical context. While selective testing remains reasonable in resource-limited settings, the balance of evidence favors **universal once-in-a-lifetime measurement** [^d03224b7].

### A focused update to the 2019 NLA scientific statement on use of lipoprotein (a) in clinical practice [^45e79243]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). Medium credibility.

Since the 2019 National Lipid Association (NLA) Scientific Statement on Use of Lipoprotein(a) in Clinical Practice was issued, accumulating epidemiological data have clarified the relationship between lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] level and cardiovascular disease risk and risk reduction. Therefore, the NLA developed this focused update to guide clinicians in applying this emerging evidence in clinical practice. We now have sufficient evidence to support the recommendation to measure Lp(a) levels at least once in every adult for risk stratification. Individuals with Lp(a) levels < 75 nmol/L (30 mg/dL) are considered low risk, individuals with Lp(a) levels ≥ 125 nmol/L (50 mg/dL) are considered high risk, and individuals with Lp(a) levels between 75 and 125 nmol/L (30–50 mg/dL) are at intermediate risk. Cascade screening of first-degree relatives of patients with elevated Lp(a) can identify additional individuals at risk who require intervention. Patients with elevated Lp(a) should receive early, more-intensive risk factor management, including lifestyle modification and lipid-lowering drug therapy in high-risk individuals, primarily to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved an indication for lipoprotein apheresis (which reduces both Lp(a) and LDL-C) in high-risk patients with familial hypercholesterolemia and documented coronary or peripheral artery disease whose Lp(a) level remains ≥ 60 mg/dL [∼150 nmol/L)] and LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL on maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy. Although Lp(a) is an established independent causal risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and despite the high prevalence of Lp(a) elevation (∼1 of 5 individuals), measurement rates are low, warranting improved screening strategies for cardiovascular disease prevention.

### Global think tank on the clinical considerations and management of lipoprotein (a): the top questions and answers regarding what clinicians need to know [^46d0da2d]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Evidence from Mendelian randomization studies suggest that lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) has a causal role in the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. However, guidelines and consensus statement recommendations vary regarding how clinicians should incorporate Lp(a) into patient care. To provide practical answers to key questions pertaining to Lp(a) that clinicians will find useful when assessing and treating patients, a global think tank was convened. Representatives from seven national and international stakeholder organizations answered questions that were focused on: Lp(a) measurement; ethnic, gender, and age considerations; factoring Lp(a) into risk assessment; and current and emerging treatment options for elevated Lp(a). This manuscript summarizes the finding from this global think tank. Areas requiring further investigation were identified, and the need to standardize reporting of Lp(a) levels to ensure harmonization and comparability across laboratories and research studies is emphasized.

The identification of individuals who would benefit most from Lp(a) testing is essential for optimising cardiovascular risk assessment and implementing effective prevention strategies. While the evidence supporting Lp(a) as an independent risk factor for ASCVD and CAVD continues to grow, testing remains grossly underutilised. Determining appropriate testing strategies involves integrating guideline recommendations, identifying high‐risk groups, addressing population‐specific risks and overcoming practical barriers to implementation.

3.1 Guidelines and recommendations: A shift towards universal testing

Over the past decade, guidelines regarding Lp(a) measurement have evolved significantly, reflecting the growing recognition of its role in cardiovascular risk stratification. It is estimated that nearly 1 in 5 individuals worldwide have an elevated Lp(a) level (≥ 50 mg/dL or ≥ 125 nmol/L). In 2018, the American Heart Association (AHA) and American College of Cardiology (ACC) included elevated Lp(a) (≥ 50 mg/dL or ≥ 125 nmol/L) as a 'risk‐enhancing factor' in the American cholesterol management guidelines.

The 2019 ESC/EAS guidelines recommended a 'once‐in‐a‐lifetime' measurement of Lp(a) for all adults ≥ 18 years old, specifically to identify individuals with very high Lp(a) levels (> 180 mg/dL or > 430 nmol/L), which may confer a lifetime risk equivalent to heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia. The rationale behind this universal testing approach is grounded in the genetic determination of Lp(a) levels, which remain relatively stable over a person's lifetime and are minimally influenced by lifestyle factors. Most recently, from 2020 to 2024, various expert consensus statements have further strengthened the case for broader Lp(a) screening.

However, universal testing poses challenges, particularly in resource‐limited settings, where prioritisation becomes essential. In such contexts, testing may be reserved for individuals at the highest risk of Lp(a)‐mediated CVD, ensuring that limited healthcare resources are utilised where they can have the greatest impact.

Guidance for the Use of Lipoprotein(a) in Clinical Practice

Lipoprotein(a): Clinical Considerations for Diagnosis and Testing

Testing for elevated lipoprotein(a) is not routinely performed in clinical practice despite recommendations from numerous medical societies for cascade screening in people with a family history of premature ASCVD and/or elevated lipoprotein(a) (Table 2)., In a 2022 Scientific Statement, the American Heart Association recommended testing lipoprotein(a) in individuals with a family/personal history of ASCVD. It proposed that once standardization of lipoprotein(a) assays is achieved, a reassessment of broader population‐based screening should be considered. Furthermore, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society and the European Atherosclerosis Society advise lipoprotein(a) testing at least once in all adults, irrespective of family history. The success of cascade screening for identifying affected family members has already been demonstrated in familial hypercholesterolemia and has been shown to be cost‐effective.

Table 2
Recommendations for lipoprotein(a) Testing,

Practically, current lipoprotein(a) testing requires only routine, nonfasting blood draws, making it convenient for patients and health care professionals. While plasma lipoprotein(a) levels can be measured in nmol/L or mg/dL, intensive CVD risk factor management should be recommended for all individuals with elevated lipoprotein(a) (high risk is defined as ≥ 50 mg/dL [> 125 nmol/L]). The benefits of lipoprotein(a) testing include improved CVD risk stratification by proactively identifying individuals at ASCVD risk and reclassifying risk in patients with clinical ASCVD. From a healthcare system perspective, early and intensive CVD risk factor management in individuals with elevated lipoprotein(a) may lead to significant long‐term cost savings.

3.2 Identifying high‐risk groups for Lp(a) testing

While universal testing may be ideal, targeted testing remains a pragmatic approach in most clinical settings. The following groups should be prioritised for Lp(a) measurement (Table 1):
Individuals with premature ASCVD. Premature ASCVD, defined as cardiovascular events occurring before age 55 years in men and 65 years in women, points to possible underlying genetic contributors, including elevated Lp(a). In these individuals, Lp(a) measurement may uncover a risk factor that may not be addressed by standard lipid‐lowering therapies alone.
Family history of premature ASCVD or elevated Lp(a). Given the strong heritability of Lp(a) levels, first‐degree relatives of individuals with premature ASCVD or elevated Lp(a) should undergo testing. Cascade screening in such families can identify at‐risk individuals before the onset of clinical disease, allowing for early intervention.
Recurrent ASCVD despite optimal LDL‐lowering therapy. Patients with less than expected response to statins or who continue to experience cardiovascular events despite achieving low‐density lipoprotein‐cholesterol (LDL‐C) targets may have residual risk driven by elevated Lp(a). In such cases, Lp(a) measurement can inform the need for more aggressive secondary preventive strategies.
Patients with suspected or confirmed familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). Lp(a) elevation is common among individuals with FH and may contribute to the observed variability in cardiovascular risk within this group. Identifying elevated Lp(a) in these patients can help stratify risk and tailor management strategies.
Individuals of African and South Asian ancestry. Evidence consistently demonstrates that individuals of African descent have the highest median Lp(a) levels, followed by South Asians. Despite this, awareness and testing rates remain disproportionately low in these groups. Given the increased cardiovascular risk conferred by elevated Lp(a), routine screening should be considered, particularly among those with other risk factors or a family history of ASCVD.
Patients with CAVD. Lp(a) has emerged as a causal factor in the development of CAVD, independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. In patients presenting with CAVD, especially at a young age or without significant atherosclerotic burden, Lp(a) testing can provide insights into disease aetiology and may inform the intensity of surveillance and management strategies.
Patients with advanced subclinical atherosclerosis or enriched in ASCVD risk factors. Prior observational studies demonstrate individuals with coronary artery calcium ≥ 300 experience a risk similar to that of individuals with prior myocardial infarction or stroke; therefore, identification of individuals with advanced subclinical atherosclerosis with elevated Lp(a) may facilitate earlier prevention efforts. Additionally, there is evidence that Lp(a) may interact with several traditional risk factors, including diabetesand hypertension, to enhance ASCVD risk; however, this is an active area of ongoing research.
High‐risk individuals < 18 years old. Selective Lp(a) testing is recommended for children with clinically suspected or genetically confirmed familial hypercholesterolaemia, ischaemic stroke of undetermined aetiology, first‐degree relatives with a history of premature ASCVD or first‐degree relatives with elevated Lp(a). However, clinicians should acknowledge that Lp(a) levels may not fully stabilise until late teenage years and there is considerable variability in Lp(a) levels among youth, as intraindividual variation may be as high as 70%. Thus, repeat Lp(a) testing may be considered among high‐risk individuals < 18 years old, especially if initially measured during early childhood.

### A modern approach to dyslipidemia [^7552d23a]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Investigations and measurement.

There is no consensus regarding screening individuals for Lp(a) levels. Some guideline committees, such as the European Atherosclerosis Society/European Society of Cardiology and Canadian Cardiovascular Society, suggest measuring Lp(a) once as an adult for risk stratification. Other societies, such as the National Lipid Association, suggest screening only in high-risk situations, such as in individuals with a personal or family history of premature ASCVD, or those with known FH. At high concentrations, Lp(a) can interfere with LDL determination as a substantial portion of measured LDL-C may be contained within Lp(a) particles; therefore, measurement of Lp(a) may also be warranted in anyone who presents with LDL-C levels > 5.0 mmol/L (> 194 mg/dL) or reduced responsiveness to statins.

Because circulating Lp(a) is thought to remain relatively stable throughout life, once a baseline level is obtained, further monitoring is not required. Mass measurements of Lp(a) are less useful for predicting ASCVD risk; therefore, assays that measure molar concentrations are preferred. A high level of Lp(a) is considered to be ≥ 125 nmol/L (≥ 50 mg/dL).

Management.

Pharmacologic treatments targeting Lp(a) are currently in development, with an antisense oligonucleotide against Lp(a) demonstrating up to an 80% lowering. Ongoing outcome studies will establish if there is a role for this agent to treat elevated Lp(a) in ASCVD prevention. Until this is clarified, management of other ASCVD risk factors should be the mainstay of treatment for individuals with elevated Lp(a). More aggressive LDL-C lowering than would otherwise be recommended based on cardiovascular risk assessment may be warranted in those with elevated Lp(a).

Of currently approved lipid agents, statins can elevate Lp(a) levels, but are nonetheless considered first-line treatment in patients with high Lp(a) because of their general benefit with respect to elevated ASCVD risk. Ezetimibe has a neutral effect on Lp(a), whereas niacin lowers Lp(a). In a meta-analysis that included 6566 individuals, PCSK9 inhibitors lowered Lp(a) by 26%, although Lp(a) lowering is not currently an approved use for these agents.

### A focused update to the 2019 NLA scientific statement on use of lipoprotein (a) in clinical practice [^8021d83a]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) testing and risk categorization — Adults (aged ≥ 18 y): measurement of Lp(a) in all adults is reasonable to refine risk assessment for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events; youth (aged < 18 y): selective screening of Lp(a) is recommended in high-risk patients such as clinically suspected or genetically confirmed familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), ischemic stroke of unknown cause, first-degree relatives with a history of premature ASCVD (age < 55 years in men, < 65 years in women), or first-degree relatives with elevated Lp(a); when Lp(a) levels are used for ASCVD risk assessment, it is reasonable to use measurements ≥ 125 nmol/L (≥ 50 mg/dL) as levels suggesting high risk, levels < 75 nmol/L (< 30 mg/dL) as low risk, and levels between as intermediate risk.

### Lipid measurements in the management of cardiovascular diseases: practical recommendations a scientific statement from the National Lipid Association writing group [^e0310635]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2021). High credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] — measurement is supported in defined risk settings. Lp(a) is elevated in approximately 20% of the population and is strongly associated with increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events. Recommendations include using assays calibrated against established reference material and measuring to refine risk when premature ASCVD has occurred in adults (< 55 y of age in men; < 65 y of age in women) in the individual or family. Additionally, persons with primary severe hypercholesterolemia (LDL > 190 mg/dL), suspected familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), or those at very high risk of ASCVD should have Lp(a) measured to better define potential benefit from PCSK9 inhibitor therapy; the 2018 AHA/ACC Multi-Society Cholesterol Guideline has also identified Lp(a) as a risk enhancer test in patients at intermediate risk.

### A focused update to the 2019 NLA scientific statement on use of lipoprotein (a) in clinical practice [^e9ef7f2e]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

Professional society guidance on lipoprotein(a) for risk assessment — the 2019 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline identifies elevated Lp(a) ≥ 125 nmol/L as a risk-enhancing factor that would favor statin initiation or intensification for primary prevention in borderline or intermediate risk individuals. The 2022 European Atherosclerosis Society recommends measuring Lp(a) at least once in all adults, uses levels ≥ 125 nmol/L to rule-in ASCVD risk, and states that individuals at low or moderate 10-year CVD risk by SCORE would be recommended for more intensive treatment of LDL-C, systolic blood pressure, and lifestyle risk factors when Lp(a) is elevated. The Canadian Cardiovascular Society recommends measuring Lp(a) once in a patient's lifetime with initial lipid screening and considers Lp(a) ≥ 50 mg/dL (or ≥ 100 nmol/L) a risk modifier warranting statin therapy in intermediate-risk patients and earlier, more intensive lifestyle management in low-risk patients.

### A focused update to the 2019 NLA scientific statement on use of lipoprotein (a) in clinical practice [^d03224b7]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) in adult cardiovascular risk assessment — Lp(a) level should be measured at least once in all adults to identify individuals with high Lp(a) levels for implementation of early and intensive risk factor management. For CVD risk assessment, Lp(a) levels should be used to stratify patients as low risk (< 75 nmol/L) or high risk (≥ 125 nmol/L), and individuals with Lp(a) levels in between should be considered as intermediate risk and also may be considered for repeat measurement. As a risk-enhancing factor, Lp(a) level can also help reclassify individuals with overall borderline, intermediate, or high risk, and this information may impact the choice of lifestyle modification and intensification of lipid-lowering therapy with statin and other drugs, including PCSK9 inhibitors. In addition, identification of individuals with high levels of Lp(a) also identifies a family at risk, and cascade screening for elevated Lp(a) should be performed in first-degree family members. Lipoprotein apheresis is indicated for patients with clinically diagnosed FH and either documented coronary artery disease or documented peripheral artery disease whose Lp(a) level remains ≥ 60 mg/dL (∼150 nmol/L) and LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL despite maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy.

### HEART UK consensus statement on lipoprotein (a): a call to action [^c18ed785]. Atherosclerosis (2019). Medium credibility.

Lipoprotein(a), Lp(a), is a modified atherogenic low-density lipoprotein particle that contains apolipoprotein(a). Its levels are highly heritable and variable in the population. This consensus statement by HEART UK is based on the evidence that Lp(a) is an independent cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor, provides recommendations for its measurement in clinical practice and reviews current and emerging therapeutic strategies to reduce CVD risk. Ten statements summarise the most salient points for practitioners and patients with high Lp(a). HEART UK recommends that Lp(a) is measured in adults as follows: 1) those with a personal or family history of premature atherosclerotic CVD; 2) those with first-degree relatives who have Lp(a) levels > 200 nmol/l; 3) patients with familial hypercholesterolemia; 4) patients with calcific aortic valve stenosis and 5) those with borderline (but < 15%) 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event. The management of patients with raised Lp(a) levels should include: 1) reducing overall atherosclerotic risk; 2) controlling dyslipidemia with a desirable non-HDL-cholesterol level of < 100 mg/dl (2.5 mmol/l) and 3) consideration of lipoprotein apheresis.

### How should public health recommendations address Lp (a) measurement, a causative risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD)? [^3289b3a4]. Atherosclerosis (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Elevated concentrations of Lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] is an inherited, causal risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). This study aims to investigate the clinical utility for patients, and the economic benefit to healthcare systems and society of measuring Lp(a) concentrations more widely today.

Methods

We conducted a structured literature review to identify the economic and health benefits and costs of measuring the Lp(a) concentration, potential barriers hindering the uptake of the measure, and potential solutions to address them. These findings were then discussed in an advisory board attended by experts and patient organisations.

Results

It was found that if Lp(a) concentration is measured more widely today, patients, healthcare system and society would experience clinical and economic benefits even before specific Lp(a) lowering pharmacological treatments become available. Furthermore, a wider uptake of the Lp(a) measurement would support the development of epidemiological data.

Conclusions

For Lp(a) measurement to be more widely used, key barriers which are hindering its uptake need to be addressed. These include i) the perception that the measure may have limited clinical value, ii) lack of awareness on Lp(a), iii) lack of data on the CV benefit of reducing Lp(a), iv) technical and clinical guidelines barriers, and v) healthcare system barriers. Scientific communities and industry should collaborate to address technical challenges and deficiencies in clinical guidelines. However, policy intervention will be crucial for national ASCVD plans to acknowledge the importance of Lp(a).

### All we need to know about lipoprotein (a) [^93ba83b8]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], a genetically determined macromolecular complex, is independently and causally associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and calcific aortic stenosis via proposed proinflammatory, prothrombotic, and proatherogenic mechanisms. While Lp(a) measurement standardization issues are being resolved, several guidelines now support testing Lp(a) at least once in each adult's lifetime for ASCVD risk prediction which can foster implementation of more aggressive primary or secondary prevention therapies. Currently, there are several emerging targeted Lp(a) lowering therapies in active clinical investigation for safety and cardiovascular benefit among both primary and secondary prevention populations. First degree relatives of patients with high Lp(a) should be encouraged to undergo cascade screening. Primary prevention patients with high Lp(a) should consider obtaining a coronary calcium score for further risk estimation and to guide further ASCVD risk factor management including consideration of low dose aspirin therapy. Secondary prevention patients with high Lp(a) levels should consider adding PCSK9 inhibition to statin therapy.

### Screening for lipid disorders in adults: recommendation… [^12d450dd]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

Summary of Recommendations Screening men: The U. S. Preventive Services Task Force strongly recommends screening men 35 years and older for lipid disorders. A recommendation. The USPSTF recommends screening men 20 to 35 years of age for lipid disorders if they are at increased risk of coronary heart disease. B recommendation. Screening women at increased risk: The USPSTF strongly recommends screening women 45 years and older for lipid disorders if they are at increased risk of CHD. A recommendation. The USPSTF recommends screening women 20 to 45 years of age for lipid disorders if they are at increased risk of CHD. There is good evidence that lipid-lowering drug therapy substantially decreases the incidence of CHD in persons with abnormal lipid levels. The absolute benefits of lipid-lowering treatment depend on a person's underlying risk of CHD.

Men older than 35 years and women older than 45 years who are at increased risk of CHD will realize a substantial benefit from treatment. There is good evidence that the harms from screening and treatment are small, and include possible labeling and the adverse effects associated with lipid-lowering therapy. USPSTF assessment The USPSTF concludes that the benefits of screening for and treating lipid disorders in all men 35 years and older, and women 45 years and older at increased risk of CHD substantially outweigh the potential harms. The USPSTF concludes that the benefits of screening for and treating lipid disorders in young adults at increased risk of CHD moderately outweigh the potential harms*. Clinical Considerations Lipid disorders, also called dyslipidemias, are abnormalities of lipoprotein metabolism and include elevations of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, or triglycerides; or deficiencies of HDL cholesterol.

These disorders can be acquired or familial. This recommendation applies to adults 20 years and older who have not previously been diagnosed with dyslipidemia. An age to stop screening has not been established. Screening may be appropriate in older persons who have never been screened; repeated screening is less important in older persons because lipid levels are less likely to increase after 65 years of age. However, because older adults have an increased baseline risk of CHD, they stand to gain greater absolute benefit from the treatment of dyslipidemia, compared with younger adults.

National Lipid Association (NLA) lipoprotein(a) update — There is sufficient evidence to support the recommendation to measure lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) levels at least once in every adult for risk stratification. Risk categories are defined as follows: individuals with Lp(a) levels < 75 nmol/L (30 mg/dL) are considered low risk, individuals with Lp(a) levels ≥ 125 nmol/L (50 mg/dL) are considered high risk, and individuals with Lp(a) levels between 75 and 125 nmol/L (30–50 mg/dL) are at intermediate risk; cascade screening of first-degree relatives of patients with elevated Lp(a) can identify additional individuals at risk.

Take‑home points for Lp(a) risk and measurement — The relationship between Lp(a) level and cardiovascular disease risk is continuous and log-linear, and rather than a single dichotomous cutoff, Lp(a) levels represent a continuum of risk; individuals with Lp(a) levels < 75 nmol/L (30 mg/dL) may be considered low risk, individuals with Lp(a) levels ≥ 125 nmol/L (50 mg/dL) may be considered high risk, and those in the "gray zone" 75 to 125 nmol/L (30–50 mg/dL) are at intermediate risk and may warrant repeat measurement; Lp(a) risk categories apply across races and ethnicities, Lp(a) should be measured at least once in every adult for cardiovascular risk assessment, should be reported in nmol/L with no conversion between mg/dL and nmol/L using a fixed factor, the previously proposed correction factor for Lp(a)-C used to adjust LDL-C calculation should not be used, concerns about Lp(a) elevation should not be a reason to discourage or discontinue a statin, and in high-risk patients with elevated Lp(a) who need additional LDL-C lowering after maximally tolerated statin therapy, a PCSK9 inhibitor may address residual risk from both LDL-C and Lp(a).

### A focused update to the 2019 NLA scientific statement on use of lipoprotein (a) in clinical practice [^01ea91f7]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

NLA focused update — Lp(a) recommendations and thresholds for assessment and therapy: Adults (aged ≥ 18 y) measurement of lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) in all adults is reasonable to refine atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk assessment (COR I, LOE B-NR). For ASCVD risk stratification, it is reasonable to use Lp(a) thresholds of ≥ 125 nmol/L (≥ 50 mg/dL) for high risk, < 75 nmol/L (< 30 mg/dL) for low risk, and values between as intermediate risk (COR IIa, LOE B-NR). The use of an adjustment factor to estimate Lp(a)-cholesterol (Lp(a)-C) for correction of calculated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is not recommended (COR III [no benefit], LOE C-EO), and because accepted conversion factors to adjust for Lp(a)-C in LDL-C calculation have proven inaccurate, such adjustments should not be used. Lipoprotein apheresis is an FDA-approved therapy for high-risk patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and ASCVD whose Lp(a) remains ≥ 60 mg/dL (~150 nmol/L) and LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL on maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy (COR IIa, LOE B-NR), and lipoprotein apheresis is the first therapy to receive a FDA indication for Lp(a) reduction.

High‐risk groups for lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] testing.

3.3 Barriers to Lp(a) testing

In many healthcare systems, Lp(a) testing rates remain below 1%, even among high‐risk individuals who would benefit most from early identification and management of elevated levels. One key barrier hindering the widespread adoption of Lp(a) testing in clinical practice is limited clinician awareness. Despite growing evidence of its role in cardiovascular risk, many clinicians are still unfamiliar with the clinical relevance, leading to underutilisation of testing. This knowledge gap is particularly pronounced in primary care settings, where early risk assessment decisions are typically made.

3.4 Solutions to enhance Lp(a) testing

Addressing these barriers requires a multifaceted approach. Educational campaigns targeting primary care providers, endocrinologists, cardiologists and lipid specialists are essential for raising awareness about Lp(a) and its clinical implications. Incorporating Lp(a)‐related content into continuing medical education (CME) programs can further close knowledge gaps and promote best practices in cardiovascular risk assessment. Additionally, incorporation into standard risk assessments is crucial. Embedding Lp(a) measurement within routine lipid panels, particularly for high‐risk populations, can normalise testing and ensure early detection of elevated levels. To overcome technical challenges, developing cost‐effective testing protocols is also vital. Streamlining laboratory processes and adopting isoform‐insensitive assays, alongside standardising reporting units, would improve measurement consistency and clinical applicability. Lastly, integration into electronic health records (EHRs) can play a pivotal role. Implementing automated prompts for Lp(a) testing based on relevant clinical histories can ensure that testing opportunities are not overlooked during routine care, facilitating earlier identification of at‐risk individuals and enabling targeted prevention strategies.

### Lipid measurements in the management of cardiovascular diseases: practical recommendations a scientific statement from the National Lipid Association writing group [^958232a8]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2021). High credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) measurement — Lipoprotein (a) (Lp[a]) is described as an independent risk factor for ASCVD, yet clinical assays used in patient care are not well standardized; the National Lipid Association recommends an immunochemical assay calibrated against WHO/IFCCLM secondary reference material, with the preferred reporting unit in nmol/L. Reported performance indicates Lp(a) assay variability can be as high as 26% CV and the precision of most Lp(a) assays ranges between 10% to 12%. The 2018 AHA/ACC Multi-Society guideline classified Lp(a) measurement as a risk enhancer that could help guide care for persons at intermediate ASCVD risk, and measuring Lp(a) may also be valuable in patients with a strong family history of ASCVD, those who do not fully respond to statin therapy, or those with ASCVD events despite evidence-based lipid-lowering therapy.

### Lipid management in patients with endocrine disorders: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^333e9bc9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) testing in ASCVD risk — recommendation 1.4 states that in adult patients with a family history of premature ASCVD, or a personal history of ASCVD or family history of high Lp(a), we suggest measuring Lp(a) to inform decision-making about short-term and lifetime ASCVD risk and the need to intensify LDL-C–lowering therapy (2⊕⊕OO). Technical remarks add that Lp(a) ≥ 50 mg/dL (125 nmol/L) enhances risk of ASCVD, Lp(a) testing does not need to be repeated if it has previously been measured (ie, in childhood or early adulthood), and it is not yet known whether reducing Lp(a) reduces ASCVD.

### Why, how and in whom should we measure levels of lipoprotein (a): a review of the latest evidence and clinical implications [^4c747af1]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a genetically determined, causal risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD). Despite robust evidence from epidemiological and genetic studies, Lp(a) remains underrecognised in clinical practice due to challenges in measurement, lack of guideline familiarity and limited therapeutic options. In this narrative review, we summarise the pathophysiological mechanisms linking Lp(a) to atherogenesis, thrombosis and inflammation, emphasising its unique structural features and causal role in cardiovascular disease. We discuss assay methodologies and make the case for a single lifetime measurement given the genetic stability of Lp(a). We review guideline-based indications for testing, highlighting high-risk populations such as those with premature ASCVD, a family history of cardiovascular disease and individuals of African or South Asian ancestry. We additionally outline clinical strategies to reduce ASCVD risk in individuals with elevated Lp(a), including lifestyle optimisation, statin therapy, PCSK9 inhibitors, and aspirin in select populations. Emerging targeted therapies, including antisense oligonucleotides and siRNA-based agents, demonstrate up to 90% Lp(a) reduction and are currently being evaluated in large-scale cardiovascular outcomes trials. As precision medicine advances, Lp(a) represents both a critical risk factor and a promising therapeutic target. Broader implementation of Lp(a) testing, particularly in high-risk individuals, will help improve ASCVD prevention efforts.

### A focused update to the 2019 NLA scientific statement on use of lipoprotein (a) in clinical practice [^c5167ba3]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

NLA focused update — Lp(a) screening and risk across populations: We recommend measuring Lp(a) in every adult at least once for cardiovascular risk assessment (see Table 1; COR I, LOE B-NR). The risk for ASCVD events that is associated with Lp(a) is independent of LDL-C and is attributed to the atherogenic, proinflammatory, and prothrombotic properties of Lp(a), and Lp(a) is associated with an increased risk of incident ASCVD even in the absence of a family history of heart disease. Systematic universal Lp(a) screening can improve health outcomes by increasing awareness of, and enabling precision in, ASCVD prevention strategies and individualization of therapy selection. Elevated Lp(a) remains a risk factor for ASCVD even with aggressive LDL-C lowering by statins and nonstatins (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 [PCSK9] inhibitors, bempedoic acid, and ezetimibe), and early, and more-intensive management of modifiable risk factors, including LDL-C and non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) levels, is warranted in at-risk patients who have elevated Lp(a). This update also notes that elevated Lp(a) is not a risk factor for venous thromboembolism and that in the pediatric population (children < 18 years of age) elevation of Lp(a) has been linked to the occurrence of arterial ischemic stroke.

4.1 Cardiovascular risk assessment

There is a stepwise higher risk of ASCVD and CAVD across increasing Lp(a) levelswith about a 40% higher risk of ASCVD per 50 mg/dL increase in Lp(a). Similarly, an approximate 82% higher risk for incident aortic valve calcium (AVC) begins as low as 18 mg/dL Lp(a). The commonly used threshold for elevated Lp(a) level internationally is ≥ 50 mg/dL or ≥ 125 nmol/L (Table 2). In 2024, the U.S. National Lipid Association introduced a gradation of risk across Lp(a), defining individuals with low (< 30 mg/dL or < 75 nmol/L), intermediate (30–49 mg/dL or 75–124 nmol/L) and high (≥ 50 mg/dL or ≥ 125 nmol/L) risk. The European Society of Cardiology and European Atherosclerosis Society define very‐high Lp(a) level at a threshold of ≥ 180 mg/dL or 430 nmol/L, which corresponds to the 99th percentile and risk similar to that of familial hypercholesterolaemia.

"Lp(a) levels can be very helpful for assessment of familial risk of atherosclerosis."

### A focused update to the 2019 NLA scientific statement on use of lipoprotein (a) in clinical practice [^4af0d66f]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

Risk stratification thresholds and repeat testing for lipoprotein(a) — individuals with Lp(a) levels < 75 nmol/L (30 mg/dL) can be considered low risk and those with Lp(a) levels ≥ 125 nmol/L (50 mg/dL) should be considered high risk (COR IIa, LOE B-R), with a gray zone for repeat measurement between 75 and 125 nmol/L (30–50 mg/dL). Because levels are relatively stable in primary prevention, measurement of Lp(a) once for low- or high-risk categories is reasonable, while repeat measurement may be warranted for intermediate-risk patients such as women after menopause, those who develop proteinuria and chronic kidney disease, or those with hypothyroidism; the prior NLA approach was dichotomous at ≥ 100 nmol/L in White patients.

### Lipoprotein (a) testing in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in 5 large US health systems [^3c901ceb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Despite advancements in treatment, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains the leading cause of morbidity and death across the world. Multiple societal guidelines recommend aggressive lowering of low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) in patients with ASCVD, yet residual risk still remains. One major contributor to residual risk is elevated lipoprotein (a), an apolipoprotein B100–containing lipoprotein bound with apolipoprotein (a), which has been shown to have an independent and causal effect on early‐onset atherosclerosis.lipoprotein (a) is primarily genetically determined, and elevated levels affect one in five individuals.

Current guideline recommendations regarding lipoprotein (a) vary across societies. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association recommend testing for lipoprotein (a) in primary prevention individuals at borderline or intermediate risk in order to reclassify risk, and testing in all individuals (both primary and secondary prevention) with a premature family history of ASCVD. The European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines recommend measurement of lipoprotein (a) once in a lifetime in all individuals to identify those with extremely elevated levels (> 180 mg/dL or > 430 nmol/L), which could serve as an equivalent lifetime ASCVD risk to those with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Additionally, the European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society recommend testing in all individuals with a premature family history of ASCVD and to reclassify risk in those at moderate and high risk. Furthermore, the National Lipid Associationrecommends testing for lipoprotein (a) in those with first‐degree relatives with premature ASCVD, a personal history of premature ASCVD, or primary severe hypercholesterolemia.

### Independence of lipoprotein (a) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-mediated cardiovascular risk: a participant-level meta-analysis [^c018e33c]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) are independently associated with greater risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). – Management of elevated LDL-C levels, particularly in the context of elevated ASCVD risk, has been well established in clinical practice guidelines, with statins as first-line therapy, followed by ezetimibe and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors (PCSK9i) in those who do not achieve prespecified goals. However, the understanding of the optimal management of patients with elevated Lp(a) levels, particularly in the context of LDL-C, is uncertain.

American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recommend use of elevated Lp(a) level as a risk enhancer for overall risk assessment, which primarily guides the use of statin and other lipid-lowering therapies. However, the European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society, Canadian Cardiovascular Society, and recent National Lipid Association guidelines recommend measuring Lp(a) level once in all adults, and these guidelines and the European Atherosclerosis Society consensus statement recommend addressing LDL-C levels more aggressively when the Lp(a) level is elevated to attempt to offset Lp(a)-mediated risk. – However, previous studies have suggested that ASCVD risk is elevated in association with elevated Lp(a) level, even when the LDL-C level is relatively low, or despite a background of moderate to high-intensity statin therapy. –

### Lipoprotein (a) testing trends in a large academic health system in the United States [^9818144b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Elevated lipoprotein(a) is a well‐established risk factor for multiple cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), especially coronary artery disease and aortic stenosis (AS). Lipoprotein(a) is also associated with ischemic stroke, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and heart failure (HF). The accumulation of epidemiologic and genetic studies strongly supports a causal role for lipoprotein(a) in CVD in diverse populations, even with low levels of low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol. There is also growing evidence that lipoprotein(a) lowering translates to clinical benefit. Lipoprotein(a) levels of > 30 and > 50 mg/dL are estimated to be present in 35% to 40% and 24% to 29% of the global population, respectively. There is consensus among the major international guidelines that lipoprotein(a) is an independent and genetically determined risk factor that enhances CVD risk, and all guidelines provide at least a relative indication for lipoprotein(a) testing in those with a family history of premature CVD. However, the guidelines differ in their recommendations for which other specific populations should be tested for lipoprotein(a). The European Society of Cardiology and Canadian Cardiovascular Society recommend screening all adults for elevated lipoprotein(a) at least once in their lifetime. The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology, National Lipid Association, and American Association of Clinical Endocrinology recommend lipoprotein(a) testing in patients with premature CVD, especially if not explained by other major risk factors. In addition, the National Lipid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinology recommend checking lipoprotein(a) in patients at risk for progressive AS.

Despite the availability of these guidelines, lipoprotein(a) remains an underappreciated CVD risk factor, and rates of testing in the United States are anecdotally low but have not been well quantified. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of lipoprotein(a) testing in all individuals in the study population, individuals with several CVD diagnoses, and those undergoing other selected cardiac testing. Addressing these questions will help to clarify the current baseline for lipoprotein(a) testing and identify opportunities to improve testing rates when clinically appropriate.

TABLE 2
Major societal guideline lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] thresholds.

Risk assessment and management of individuals with elevated Lp(a) are actionable. Individuals with elevated Lp(a) may benefit from additional risk assessment, including a detailed family history and selective use of subclinical atherosclerosis imaging. Family history of CHD in a first‐degree relative (17%) and elevated Lp(a) (25%) are independently associated with an increased risk of incident ASCVD over 20‐year follow‐up, and those with a concurrent family history of CHD and elevated Lp(a) experience the highest risk (43%). Therefore, risk attributable to family history of CHD and elevated Lp(a) appears to be additive, and clinicians should strive to assess such risk, especially among those with elevated Lp(a). These efforts may also facilitate cascade screening. In addition to family history, measurement of subclinical atherosclerosis burden may be helpful to guide risk assessment among individuals with elevated Lp(a) who do not have clinical ASCVD (Figure 2). Among individuals without prior myocardial infarction or stroke, measurement of coronary artery calcium (CAC) provides further granularity to understanding risk for those with elevated Lp(a), as CAC and Lp(a) are independently associated with ASCVD. Compared to persons without elevated Lp(a) and absence of CAC, Lp(a) ≥ 50 mg/dL is associated with a 29% higher risk of ASCVD, whereas CAC 1‐99 Agatston Units (AU) and ≥ 100 AU are associated with a 68% and 2.7‐fold higher ASCVD risk, respectively. When assessed concurrently, there is a 4.7‐fold higher risk of ASCVD for individuals with Lp(a) ≥ 50 mg/dL and CAC ≥ 100. While there is an observed 31% higher ASCVD risk for those with Lp(a) ≥ 50 mg/dL and CAC = 0, this risk is not significant after adjusting for traditional risk factors and is considerably lower when compared to those with higher CAC burden. However, given the older average age of individuals and inclusion criteria based upon the absence of clinical ASCVD for these population‐based studies, it is possible that individuals with elevated Lp(a) and premature ASCVD events were excluded from this analysis. Thus, measurement of CAC may help personalise risk assessment for individuals with elevated Lp(a) and guide discussions involving lifestyle management as well as the initiation of preventive pharmacotherapies, including statin and aspirin. Further research is needed to understand risk assessment and personalise shared decision‐making involving therapies for individuals with elevated Lp(a) and absence of CAC.

### Screening for lipid disorders in adults: recommendations and… [^e548cb67]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Summary of Recommendations The USPSTF strongly recommends that clinicians routinely screen men 35 years and older and women 45 years and older for lipid disorders and treat abnormal lipid levels in persons who are at increased risk of coronary heart disease. The USPSTF has found good evidence that lipid measurement can identify asymptomatic middle-aged persons at increased risk of coronary heart disease and that lipid-lowering drug therapy substantially decreases the incidence of coronary heart disease in such persons with abnormal lipid levels and causes few major harms. The USPSTF concludes that the benefits of screening for and treating lipid disorders in persons who are middle aged and older substantially outweigh the harms. The USPSTF recommends that screening for lipid disorders include measurement of total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.

The USPSTF found good evidence that measurement of HDL along with total cholesterol improves the identification of persons at increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Good evidence from randomized trials demonstrates that persons with low HDL without high total cholesterol benefit from treatment. Screening is recommended for men 20 to 35 years of age and women 20 to 45 years of age in the presence of any of the following conditions: diabetes; a family history of cardiovascular disease before age 50 years in male relatives or age 60 years in female relatives; a family history suggestive of familial hyperlipidemia; and multiple risk factors for coronary heart disease. Screening may be appropriate in older persons who have never been screened, but repeated screening is less important in older persons because lipid levels are less likely to increase after age 65 years.

Treatment decisions should take into account overall risk of heart disease rather than lipid levels alone. Overall risk assessment should include the presence and severity of the following risk factors: age, gender, diabetes, elevated blood pressure, family history, and smoking. Tools that incorporate specific information on multiple risk factors provide more accurate estimation of cardiovascular risk than categorizations based on counting the numbers of risk factors. Discussion The clearest benefit of lipid screening is the identification of persons whose near-term risk of coronary heart disease is sufficiently high to justify drug therapy or other intensive lifestyle interventions to lower cholesterol levels. Screening men older than 35 years and women older than 45 years will identify nearly all persons whose risk of coronary heart disease is as high as that of the patients in the existing primary prevention trials.

### What's next for lipoprotein (a)? A National Lipid Association report from an expert panel discussion [^622ed2a1]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). Medium credibility.

This is an exciting time in the lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] field. Attention to this important lipoprotein and potent cardiovascular risk marker is transitioning from the purview of the specialist to that of the general practitioner. Its clinical adoption as an important test is increasing in momentum. There is evidence that Lp(a) contributes to the pathology of atherothrombotic disease, aortic valve stenosis, and childhood ischemic strokes. Three large, Phase 3, randomized, cardiovascular outcomes trials in which Lp(a) is specifically and substantially lowered by mRNA-directed therapies in secondary prevention settings are in progress and will start to report results as early as 2025. Regardless of outcomes, there remain many unanswered questions about Lp(a), ranging from fundamental unknowns about Lp(a) biology, to the complexity of its measurement, optimal screening strategies, and clinical management in individuals with high Lp(a) levels both with and without overt cardiovascular disease. Accordingly, The National Lipid Association (NLA) convened an Expert Discussion involving clinicians and fundamental researchers to identify knowledge gaps in our understanding of Lp(a) biology and pathogenicity and to discuss approaches in the management of elevated Lp(a) in different clinical settings.

### Lipoprotein (a): a risk factor for atherosclerosis and an emerging therapeutic target [^8f041c48]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is a complex circulating lipoprotein, and increasing evidence has demonstrated its role as a risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and as a possible therapeutic target. Lp(a) atherogenic effects are attributed to several potential mechanisms in addition to cholesterol accumulation in the arterial wall, including proinflammatory effects mainly mediated by oxidised phospholipids. Several studies have found a causal and independent relationship between Lp(a) levels and cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, several studies also suggest a causal association between Lp(a) levels and calcific aortic valve stenosis. Available lipid-lowering agents have at best moderate impact on Lp(a) levels. Among available therapies, antibody proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors are the most effective in reducing Lp(a). Potent Lp(a)-lowering treatments that target LPA expression are under development. Lp(a) level measurement poses some challenges due to the absence of a definitive reference method and the reporting of Lp(a) values as molar (nanomoles per litre (nmol/L)) or mass concentrations (milligrams per decilitre (mg/dL)) by different assays. Currently, Lp(a) measurement is recommended to refine cardiovascular risk in specific clinical settings, that is, in individuals with a family history of premature ASCVD, in patients with ASCVD not explained by standard risk factors or in those with recurrent events despite optimal management of traditional risk factors. Patients with high Lp(a) levels should be managed with more intensive approaches to treat other modifiable cardiovascular risk factors. Overall, this review focuses on Lp(a) as an ASCVD risk factor and therapeutic target. Furthermore, it reports practical recommendations for Lp(a) measurement and interpretation and updated evidence on Lp(a)-lowering approaches.

Third, many physicians aim to achieve an "LDL‐C" < 70 mg/dL for high‐risk patients, which is further supported by guidelines. 1 Thus, many patients with "LDL‐C" ≥ 70 mg/dL and elevated lipoprotein(a) while on statin therapy, in fact, already have true LDL‐C significantly lower than 70 mg/dL. The recommendation to further increase LDL‐C–lowering therapy in such patients may not accurately reflect whether true LDL‐C versus lipoprotein(a) reflects additional residual risk. Because statins tend to increase lipoprotein(a), 33 further increase in statin dosage in a patient with already true low LDL‐C may be counterproductive. Similarly, in patients being treated with PCSK9 inhibitors that achieve exceedingly low LDL‐C (ie, < 20 mg/dL), true LDL‐C levels may be at or near zero if lipoprotein(a) is elevated, as we suggested recently. 3

Fourth, should lipoprotein(a) mass and/or cholesterol content be part of the FH diagnosis? Using a more accurate measurement of LDL‐C would result in many subjects not meeting the criterion of "LDL‐C" ≥ 190 mg/dL used in many scores unless the Lp(a)‐C was included in the measurement. 34 The concept to formally include lipoprotein(a) in the diagnosis of FH is consistent with studies showing a higher risk of major adverse cardiovascular events if patients with FH have concomitantly elevated lipoprotein(a) levels. 35

Fifth, the meta‐analysis included a wide range of patients receiving different statins and further reflecting their use in a wide range of CVD prevention cohorts. Accurately quantitating true LDL‐C without its content of Lp(a)‐C will be important in defining the magnitude of benefit from "LDL‐C" lowering agents, particularly in patients with elevated lipoprotein(a), which may represent up to a third of patients in the population and in recent clinical trials 36, 37 who are more likely to have a true LDL‐C that is lower than their LDL‐C laboratory measurement.

### Lipoprotein (a) genotype influences the clinical diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia [^c5472432]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Our results highlight the importance of measuring lp(a) to perform the diagnosis of FH appropriately and to exclude the possibility that the observed phenotype is driven by elevated levels of lp(a) before performing the genetic test that is often requested based on the presence of elevated LDL‐C levels.

Clinical and laboratory investigations for differentiating FH, elevated lp(a), or the combination of both are also important for accurate risk stratification and treatment strategies, as in the future patients with both elevated lp(a) and FH condition may be shown to benefit from interventions to reduce both LDL‐C and lp(a) plasma levels.

### Elevated lipoprotein (a) is common in people with familial hypercholesterolemia and negative genetic screening [^794488e4]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

What is the clinical question being addressed?

Can we determine if elevated Lp(a) levels are more common in patients with a clinical presentation of familial hypercholesterolemia in whom no mutation was identified?

What is the main finding?

Results show high rates (> 50%) of an alternative, genetic lipoprotein-mediated contributor to ASCVD, suggesting routine Lp(a) measurement in all such patients globally.

Lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] is a largely genetically determined cardiovascular risk marker that is strongly and monotonically associated with composite atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) independently of other traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Furthermore, there is strong genetic evidence for its causal relationship with ASCVD and very high levels of Lp(a) (> 200 mg/dL) may represent a comparable lifetime risk of coronary heart disease to genetically confirmed familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) while being up to twice as prevalent. Despite this, understanding of its clinical relevance in cardiovascular risk assessment is limited in many medical circles.

Given the possibility that elevated Lp(a) levels can inflate measured low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, there is a risk of misdiagnosing FH when LDL-C levels are evaluated without considering Lp(a) measurements. Accurate differentiation between phenotypic FH and genetically confirmed FH, in the context of Lp(a) levels, is crucial given also that the Lp(a) component of measured LDL-C is not lowered by conventional lipid-lowering agents. In this article, pseudo-FH refers to a presentation of possible FH with negative FH genetics. Based on a 2024 focused update of National Lipid Association 2019 guidelines, Lp(a) > 50 mg/dL (> 125 nmol/L) is considered to be high risk and < 30 mg/dL (< 75 nmol/L) low risk, with an intermediate risk category between these 2 values. When considering the general population, between 16% to 24% of people may have Lp(a) > 50 mg/dL and around 35% > 30 mg/dL.

The aim of this work was to determine Lp(a) levels in a cohort of patients with pseudo-FH.

### Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol corrected for lipoprotein (a) cholesterol, risk thresholds, and cardiovascular events [^b0f871c6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present study suggests that the CVD risk attributed to "LDL‐C" is potentiated by the additional contribution of Lp(a)‐C. Furthermore, estimating true LDL‐C by correcting for the Lp(a)‐C content reassigns 30% to 41% of patients into lower traditional LDL‐C categories. Figure 4 displays the heterogeneity with respect to the relative contributions of true LDL and lipoprotein(a) in individuals with similar laboratory‐measured LDL‐C. LDL and lipoprotein(a) have distinct biological properties and respond differently to lipid‐lowering therapies, which cannot be appreciated if they are evaluated as a composite within LDL‐C. Although the contribution of Lp(a)‐C to what is measured as "LDL‐C" may be less relevant in individuals with low lipoprotein(a) mass, in 20% of the population with lipoprotein(a) mass > 50 mg/dL, ≥ 14% of the cholesterol attributed to LDL is instead Lp(a)‐C. Moreover, > 28% of what is measured as "LDL‐C" may come from Lp(a)‐C in 10% of the population with lipoprotein(a) mass > 100 mg/dL. Refinement in techniques to accurately measure LDL‐C, particularly in patients with elevated lipoprotein(a) levels, is warranted to accurately attribute risk to the responsible lipoproteins.

### A focused update to the 2019 NLA scientific statement on use of lipoprotein (a) in clinical practice [^61db4aea]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

Pediatric lipoprotein(a) screening and risk — We recommend selective screening of Lp(a) in high-risk children < 18 years of age, including those with clinically suspected or genetically confirmed familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), first-degree relatives with a history of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) (age < 55 years in men, < 65 years in women), ischemic stroke of unknown cause, or first-degree relatives with elevated Lp(a); moreover, a finding of elevated Lp(a) in a child should trigger cascade screening of immediate family members. Elevated Lp(a) is associated with ischemic stroke in children (odds ratio 6.3 [95% CI 4.5–8.7] for Lp(a) levels > 30 mg/dL [75 nmol/L]), and individuals with elevated Lp(a) (≥ 30 mg/dL) as children had ~2 times higher risk for ASCVD events as adults, while those with both elevated Lp(a) and LDL-C (≥ 130 mg/dL) as children had ~4 times higher risk; Lp(a) reaches adult levels by age 5 years.

### Lipoprotein (a) as a cardiovascular risk factor: current status [^59af5e16]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Aims

The aims of the study were, first, to critically evaluate lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] as a cardiovascular risk factor and, second, to advise on screening for elevated plasma Lp(a), on desirable levels, and on therapeutic strategies.

Methods and results

The robust and specific association between elevated Lp(a) levels and increased cardiovascular disease (CVD)/coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, together with recent genetic findings, indicates that elevated Lp(a), like elevated LDL-cholesterol, is causally related to premature CVD/CHD. The association is continuous without a threshold or dependence on LDL- or non-HDL-cholesterol levels. Mechanistically, elevated Lp(a) levels may either induce a prothrombotic/anti-fibrinolytic effect as apolipoprotein(a) resembles both plasminogen and plasmin but has no fibrinolytic activity, or may accelerate atherosclerosis because, like LDL, the Lp(a) particle is cholesterol-rich, or both. We advise that Lp(a) be measured once, using an isoform-insensitive assay, in subjects at intermediate or high CVD/CHD risk with premature CVD, familial hypercholesterolaemia, a family history of premature CVD and/or elevated Lp(a), recurrent CVD despite statin treatment, ≥ 3% 10-year risk of fatal CVD according to European guidelines, and/or ≥ 10% 10-year risk of fatal + non-fatal CHD according to US guidelines. As a secondary priority after LDL-cholesterol reduction, we recommend a desirable level for Lp(a) < 80th percentile (less than ∼50 mg/dL). Treatment should primarily be niacin 1–3 g/day, as a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled intervention trials demonstrates reduced CVD by niacin treatment. In extreme cases, LDL-apheresis is efficacious in removing Lp(a).

Conclusion

We recommend screening for elevated Lp(a) in those at intermediate or high CVD/CHD risk, a desirable level < 50 mg/dL as a function of global cardiovascular risk, and use of niacin for Lp(a) and CVD/CHD risk reduction.

### Elevated lipoprotein (a) is common in people with familial hypercholesterolemia and negative genetic screening [^582b1690]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In a cohort of patients with so-called pseudo-FH, we demonstrate a high prevalence of elevated Lp(a) levels. These results demonstrate high rates of an alternative, genetic lipoprotein mediated, and at least partial cause, of increased ASCVD risk in this clinically challenging group of patients. That 52% of such patients had a Lp(a) > 30 mg/dL and 42% had levels > 50 mg/dL shows that routine Lp(a) measurement should be considered in all patients being screening for FH.

The data suggest a 188% increase in Lp(a) and 3.9-fold increased odds of elevated Lp(a) when compared to UK Biobank. The Lp(a) values reported herein are also elevated compared to the general patient population of the United States. Given that the risk-concentration relationship appears positively linear, these patients are at significant risk of ASCVD when compared to the general population. This is of clinical pertinence given the low rates of Lp(a) testing in many clinical settings.

In these findings, higher Lp(a) levels are likely to contribute to polygenic FH. This should be considered when formulating an individual's cardiovascular risk and planning appropriate cascade testing. While European Atherosclerosis Society guidance calls for Lp(a) measurements at least once in all patients, such testing has been sparsely adopted in many settings due to cost, lack of knowledge, and no definitive treatments for elevated Lp(a). Thus, we need to better define groups who would value from such measurements, at least until major outcome trials report. This work suggests that prioritizing patients with pseudo-FH may be an appropriate place to begin wider testing.

In conclusion, patients with pseudo-FH show increased prevalence of high Lp(a) compared to the general population. That 1 in 2 patients with such a history have at least moderately elevated Lp(a) levels (> 30 mg/dL) means that many patients can be better incentivized to consider lipid-lowering therapy. Such findings further recommend the need to include routine Lp(a) testing in all patients suspected of having FH.

Apolipoprotein B (apoB) and lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] — risk-enhancing thresholds and indications: A relative indication for apoB measurement would be triglyceride ≥ 200 mg/dL, and a level > 130 mg/dL corresponds to an LDL-C level ≥ 160 mg/dL and constitutes a risk-enhancing factor; a persistent elevation of apoB can be considered a risk-enhancing factor. Relative indications for Lp(a) measurement are family history of premature ASCVD or personal history of ASCVD not explained by major risk factors, and in the present document an elevation of Lp(a) is considered to be a risk-enhancing factor; if a decision is made to measure Lp(a), an Lp(a) ≥ 50 mg/dL or ≥ 125 nmol/L, Lp(a) may be considered a risk-enhancing factor, and current evidence shows that it should be considered in women only in the presence of hypercholesterolemia with the understanding that the improvement in risk prediction in adult women in a large clinical trial was minimal.

### Lipid measurements in the management of cardiovascular diseases: practical recommendations a scientific statement from the National Lipid Association writing group [^f58c8b42]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2021). High credibility.

Key points for lipid measures in clinical care — utility and standardization notes. Both LDL-C and non-HDL-C have considerable utility to assess ASCVD risk and residual risk. Measurement of apolipoprotein B (apoB) may help to guide therapy in persons as part of the initial lipid evaluation in selected patients and may help to guide therapy in persons on lipid therapy. Measurement of LDL particle number (LDL-P) may help to guide therapy after initial evaluation in selected patients, but LDL-P assays are not standardized. Measurement of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] can help to guide therapy in persons with primary hypercholesterolemia or those at very high risk to develop ASCVD events. Advanced lipoprotein tests (e.g. LDL particle number, small dense LDL-C, or remnant cholesterol) lack appropriate standardization and cross-comparison across methods is difficult.

### Is there a need for sex-tailored lipoprotein (a) cut-off values for coronary artery disease risk stratification? [^e413baee]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] was recognized as a macromolecule in plasma in 1963. It is a lipoprotein similar to low‐density lipoprotein (LDL), which consists of apolipoprotein B100 and cholesterol. It differs from LDL by containing apolipoprotein a [Apo(a)], which is bound to the molecule covalently by a disulfide bond. Apo(a) can bind to extracellular matrix proteins, leading to subendothelial cholesterol accumulation. Accumulation of oxidized phospholipids, which prefer to bind Apo(a), stimulates the inflammatory response and enhances atherosclerotic vascular changes.

Many clinical studies have verified high Lp(a) level as a risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, and aortic stenosis. Recent guidelines recommend at least a one‐time measurement of Lp(a) level in adult life to find individuals with very high Lp(a) levels or measurement of Lp(a) level in patients with a family history of premature cardiovascular disease (CVD). According to metanalyses, the association of Lp(a) level and CVD risk is continuous and unrelated to other lipoprotein levels and traditional risk factors. Nevertheless, for the purpose of simplicity, certain cut‐off values have been determined to describe Lp(a) associated risk in clinical practice. For instance, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACCF/AHA) guidelines and the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) guidelines identify an Lp(a) level of ≥ 50 mg/dL as indicative of increased risk. The European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) Consensus Document considers an Lp(a) level of ≥ 30 mg/dL as abnormal, while the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommends a one‐time Lp(a) measurement in an individual's lifetime to detect levels exceeding 180 mg/dL.

### Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol corrected for lipoprotein (a) cholesterol, risk thresholds, and cardiovascular events [^3184187a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

There are several clinical implications to the current findings. First, these observations apply to almost all patients in whom a lipid panel is measured because absence of circulating lipoprotein(a) is extremely rare. 28 The methodological limitations of current measures/calculations of LDL‐C particularly affect patients with elevated lipoprotein(a), because the contribution of their lipoprotein(a) mass to LDL‐C will be proportionally higher as lipoprotein(a) mass increases. Lipoprotein(a) concentration > 30 mg/dL is present in ≈35% of patients in the United States 21 and similar numbers in Europe 29, and there are ≈1.4 billion people globally with lipoprotein(a) levels > 50 mg/dL. 30

Second, our data suggest that CVD risk is imprecisely depicted by "LDL‐C." For example, an "LDL‐C" of "70 mg/dL" may represent 2 different patients: one with a lipoprotein(a) mass of 15 mg/dL, Lp(a)‐C of 5 mg/dL, and true LDL‐C of 65 mg/dL, or another with a lipoprotein(a) mass of 210 mg/dL, Lp(a)‐C of 70 mg/dL, and true LDL‐C of 0 mg/dL. Despite having identical "LDL‐C" values, these 2 individuals would be expected to have unique risk profiles (Figure 4). In a recent analysis of the Copenhagen cohorts, the HR for cardiovascular mortality was 1.18 for every 15‐mg/dL increase in Lp(a)‐C. 31 In contrast, the HR for the same outcome was only 1.07 for every 15‐mg/dL increase in LDL‐C. This finding supports a more granular understanding of the components comprising "LDL‐C" for improved risk prediction. At a population level, differential lifelong exposure to LDL‐C levels as low as 10 mg/dL results in substantial differences in CVD. This suggests that the contribution of Lp(a)‐C to CVD events, which is directly related to lipoprotein(a) mass that is genetically determined and contributes risk from birth, can be substantial, even with modest elevations of Lp(a)‐C levels. For example, lipoprotein(a) levels at upper limit of normal at 30 mg/dL may contribute as much as 9 to 13.5 mg/dL of cholesterol to the LDL‐C measurement. This value is similar to loss‐of‐function PCSK9 mutations associated with lifelong lower risk of CVD. 32

Consequences for risk thresholds

While the association between Lp(a) and cardiovascular outcomes is linear, in clinical practice threshold levels identify values expected to translate to a clinically significant increase in risk, although analytical issues may raise questions about their validity. One solution is to define assay specific cut-offs, analogous to those used in different cardiac troponin assays. This consensus panel suggests a pragmatic approach, with Lp(a) cut-offs to 'rule out' (< 30 mg/dL or < 75 nmol/L) or 'rule-in' (> 50 mg/dL or > 125 nmol/L) risk. The interim grey zone (i.e. 30–50 mg/dL; 75–125 nmol/l) is relevant when considering Lp(a)-attributable risk in the presence of other risk factors and in risk stratification. Laboratories should include in reports the assay name to allow for tracking of discrepant results in patient follow-up.

Should Lp(a)-cholesterol be used to correct low-density lipoprotein cholesterol?

Cholesterol contained in Lp(a) particles cannot be separated from that in LDL particles and is therefore collectively reported as LDL-C concentration. Previous analyses of isolated Lp(a) particles suggested cholesterol accounted for 30%–45% of Lp(a) mass concentration. Thus, Lp(a)-cholesterol [Lp(a)-C] was estimated by multiplying Lp(a) mass (mg/dL) by 0.3 and used to correct LDL-C (= Lp(a)-C-corrected LDL-C).

However, this approach has limitations. Direct measurement of Lp(a) cholesterol relative to Lp(a) mass showed inter- and intraindividual variation ranging from 6% to 60%, which may impact risk prediction. Therefore, this panel does not recommend routine correction of LDL-C for Lp(a)-C. One exception may be patients with clinically suspected FHand elevated Lp(a) levels, where correction may refine or exclude diagnosis and avoid unnecessary genetic sequencing;, in previous studies, 15%–25% of those with probable/definite FH were reclassified with this approach. In addition, with the LPA locus identified as a cause of statin resistance and Lp(a)-C considered a statin-resistant fraction of LDL-C, correcting LDL-C for Lp(a)-C may differentiate patients with higher baseline Lp(a) levels associated with reduced statin responsiveness.

Conclusions

In summary, lipoprotein(a) testing rates are low overall and even in individuals diagnosed with a family or personal history of CVD and those undergoing relevant cardiac testing, and rates have increased minimally over time. Further education is needed, particularly with regard to guideline recommendations for lipoprotein(a) testing and clinical management of patients with elevated lipoprotein(a).

Figure 4
Summary of key results.

Percentage of all adults, those with a family history of CVD, and those with a personal history of CVD who have had Lp(a) testing. CVD indicates cardiovascular disease; and Lp(a), lipoprotein(a).

This study enumerates how underrecognized lipoprotein(a) is and how underdiagnosed elevated lipoprotein(a) is despite its high prevalence, with > 20% of the general population corresponding to an estimated 64 million individuals in the United States and 1.4 billion individuals worldwide. Several barriers to more widespread lipoprotein(a) testing may exist and provide targets for improvement, including the following: (1) lack of awareness of lipoprotein(a) as a CVD risk factor, (2) lack of awareness of guideline indications for lipoprotein(a) testing, (3) lack of awareness of how to assess and manage risk in patients with elevated lipoprotein(a), (4) lack of implementation programs for lipoprotein(a) testing, (5) concerns about insurance coverage, and (6) uncertainty related to the variations in clinically available assays that reported lipoprotein(a) levels. Improved dissemination of the guidelines is needed, although there is also a need for more consistency across the major societal guidelines to provide clinicians with more certainty on when to use lipoprotein(a). Many high‐quality review articles discussing the mechanistic, epidemiologic, and human population genetic studies linking lipoprotein(a) to CVD, including the recent American Heart Association and European atherosclerosis society scientific statements on lipoprotein(a), exist and can be used for education. These statements also review evidence‐based clinical approaches on how to test for lipoprotein(a), incorporate lipoprotein(a) into atherosclerotic CVD risk assessment and manage risk associated with elevated lipoprotein(a), and they describe implications for cascade screening. In addition to education, implementation of practice changes would be important to increase lipoprotein(a) testing rates. This was exemplified in a prior study by our group, observing that the rate of lipoprotein(a) testing among individuals with AS at a single academic center increased from 8.5% to a peak of 24.2% between 2010 and 2020 as a result of educational efforts and use of order sets in the electronic medical record, demonstrating that targeted efforts can meaningfully impact rates of testing. Last, although targeted lipoprotein(a)‐lowering therapies are not yet clinically available, broader recognition of elevated lipoprotein(a) would facilitate enrollment of adequate numbers of diverse participants in existing or planned clinical trials evaluating such therapies.

### Prevalence and correlates of lipoprotein (a) testing in a diverse cohort of U.S. adults [^82a2ffb6]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Presence of any non-Lp(a) lipid abnormality, family history of hypercholesterolemia or CVD, clinical CVD, prevalent type 2 diabetes, and aortic stenosis were associated with the highest odds of Lp(a) testing. These findings largely reflect prior Lp(a) testing recommendationsfor testing among those with elevated CVD risk or clinical CVD, and further underline a need to improve clinician awareness to consider increasing the implementation of Lp(a) testing among all individuals aged ≥ 18 years. Nevertheless, prioritization of testing among those at highest risk for incident and recurrent events will be important, especially for individuals with limited healthcare coverage and resource-limited health care systems.

In addition to assessing the prevalence and correlations of Lp(a) testing in a diverse, national sample, our results identified ongoing challenges with respect to the standardization of Lp(a) assays. Among those who underwent Lp(a) testing in All of Us and had reportable Lp(a) assay values, approximately 2 in 3 assays were performed using mass-based (mg/dL) vs molar concentration (nmol/L) measurement. Due to the heterogeneity in apolipoprotein(a) isoform size, mass-based measurement of Lp(a) may be imprecise among those with small and large apo(a) isoforms; therefore, measurement of molar concentration is preferred. In the context of expanding Lp(a) testing, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, are actively working to standardize particle-based assay Lp(a) measurements in the United States. Nevertheless, different Lp(a) assays have been similarly predictive of major adverse cardiovascular events.

### Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol corrected for lipoprotein (a) cholesterol, risk thresholds, and cardiovascular events [^dd230acb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

It is important to clarify that Lp(a)‐C risk is not equivalent to lipoprotein(a) mass/molar concentration mediated risk, because lipoprotein(a) additionally contains the apolipoprotein B‐100 component, the potentially thrombogenic apolipoprotein(a) peptide, as well as proinflammatory oxidized phospholipids that are significantly overrepresented on lipoprotein(a) versus LDL particles. 38, 39 These factors may additionally contribute to risk that is not reflected in its cholesterol content. In fact, lipoprotein(a) mass has been shown to be more predictive than Lp(a)‐C when measured in the same patients. 10

The primary objective of this study was to estimate the clinical impact of Lp(a)‐C's contribution to what is measured as "LDL‐C" and raise awareness to this highly underappreciated caveat of the "LDL‐C" biomarker. This study, in isolation, was not intended to provide guidance on clinical practice, but rather to demonstrate the clinical need for accurately defining the contribution of true LDL versus lipoprotein(a) toward the risk attributed to what is currently measured and reported as LDL‐C.

Genetic risk scores versus measurement for lipoprotein(a) — although genetic risk scores near the LPA locus are increasingly accurate, the Lp(a) genetic risk score appears to add no incremental value for CVD risk classification compared with Lp(a) concentrations alone, and therefore, at this time, Lp(a) measurement is preferable for risk ascertainment, mandating increased screening to identify individuals with elevated Lp(a) and high risk for CVD.

Beyond conventional recommendations for lipid testing, selective evaluation of additional lipoproteins should be considered. First, Lp(a) screening should be given strong consideration, considering a high prevalence of ∼20% in the general population. Lp(a) is a widely recognized independent risk factor for ASCVD and has been listed as a risk-enhancing factor in U.S.-based guidelines. However, many major societies recommend universal Lp(a) testing, and the time has come for ACC/AHA guidelines to follow suit. However, while trends are shifting toward universal screening, it is worth nothing that there are no specific Lp(a)-lowering treatments currently available. While there is guidance regarding contemporary treatment, specific outcome trials of Lp(a)-lowering drugs are ongoing. While it is noted as a risk-enhancing factor in AHA/ACC Cholesterol Guidelines, there is a need for clearer guidance on apolipoprotein B (ApoB) testing, given its critical role in the pathophysiology of ASCVD and as a risk factor, especially in patients with metabolic syndrome and high levels of triglycerides. European and Canadian guidelines already recommend ApoB measurement, and the National Lipid Association's recent guidance in this area is encouraging. As with Lp(a), it warrants mention that LLT outcome trials have not used ApoB as a target of treatment, and therefore, recommendations in this regard are based on secondary analyses.

### Measuring lipoprotein (a) in clinical practice to reduce… [^75b9403b]. blogs.cdc.gov (2022). Medium credibility.

Studies have shown that high levels of Lp are an inherited, independent risk factor for ASCVD. At any level of LDL-C, ASCVD event rates are higher when the Lp level is elevated. An estimated 20–30% of the global population has high Lp, defined as above the 80 th percentile concentration of > 50 mg/dl, or > 100 nmol/L). See our recent information page on Lp and its role in heart disease. Issues related to clinical validity include lack of standardization of assays used to measure Lp levels and absence of universal guidelines for screening and subsequent risk assessment of high Lp levels. Several European and Canadian societies recommend the measurement of Lp at least once in a person's lifetime. However, some studies have proposed that the risk of CVD over a certain Lp threshold is the same regardless of ancestry, while others have shown differences in risk by ancestry.

Due to these issues, current guidelines and scientific statements focus on measuring Lp levels in those with a personal or family history of premature ASCVD, those with familial hypercholesterolemia, patients with ASCVD without traditional risk factors, or those with recurrent CVD events despite optimal management of conventional risk factors; none of these guidelines address population-wide screening. Currently, lipoprotein apheresis, a specialized and potentially costly therapy, is the only treatment approved by the Food and Drug Administration for specifically lowering Lp levels. In the United States, lipoprotein apheresis is potentially covered and can be considered for Lp reduction among people with LDL ≥ 100 mg/dL, Lp ≥ 60 mg/dL, and coronary or peripheral artery disease. A single course of lipoprotein apheresis acutely lowers Lp levels by approximately 60–75%.

Traditional LDL-C lowering agents have been shown to have minimal Lp-lowering efficacy, with statins resulting in a slight increase in Lp levels. A recent post-hoc analysis addressing the impact of PCKS9 inhibitor therapy related to Lp demonstrated that in patients with acute coronary syndrome on maximal tolerated statin therapy, addition of PCSK9 inhibitors may provide clinical benefit only when Lp concentration is elevated.

### Prevalence of lipoprotein (a) measurement in patients with or at risk of cardiovascular disease [^1f854a53]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a genetically determined independent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and calcific aortic valve disease. Despite recommendations from professional societies in the cardiovascular field, the awareness of elevated Lp(a) as a risk factor and screening for Lp(a) are suspected to be low.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective, observational case control study of patient charts from January 1, 2017 to June 19, 2022. The primary aims were 1) to describe the proportion of patients at the healthcare network's primary care and cardiology clinics that met Lp(a) screening criteria and were tested; and 2) to describe the proportion of patients throughout the entire healthcare network that had Lp(a) measured.

Results

Of the 2,412,020 patient charts in the health network, only 5,942 (0.25%) had Lp(a) measured. Of the 84,581 patients in primary care or cardiology clinics who met screening criteria, only 1,311 (1.55%) had Lp(a) measured. Patients with Lp(a) measured were more likely to be younger, non-Hispanic/Latinx, had a lipid panel measured, a cardiac computed tomography (CT) imaging study, and higher low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol. Patients with ASCVD, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, aortic stenosis, peripheral vascular disease, or a stroke did not feature highly among patients who received Lp(a) testing. Having an abnormal or risk-enhancing Lp(a) level was associated with being female and/or being Black/African American.

Conclusions

Despite increased awareness of Lp(a) and its contribution to cardiovascular disease there exists a paucity of testing. Increased Lp(a) testing can identify patients who have an increased cardiovascular risk underestimated by other metrics.

Measurements of apolipoprotein B and lipoprotein (a) — For apolipoprotein B (apoB), "a relative indication for its measurement would be triglyceride ≥ 200 mg/dL," and "a level > 130 mg/dL corresponds to an LDL-C level ≥ 160 mg/dL and constitutes a risk-enhancing factor," with "a persistent elevation of apoB" also considered a risk-enhancing factor. For lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)], "relative indications for its measurement are family history of premature ASCVD or personal history of ASCVD not explained by major risk factors"; "if a decision is made to measure Lp(a), an Lp(a) ≥ 50 mg/dL or ≥ 125 nmol/L, Lp(a) may be considered a risk-enhancing factor," and "Lp(a) increases ASCVD risk especially at higher levels."

### Lipoprotein (a) testing in lipid clinics across the UK: results of a national survey [^624f2f41]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). Medium credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and its use is recommended in national and international guidelines for cardiovascular disease risk stratification. We undertook a survey to understand the availability and application of lipoprotein(a) measurement across UK lipid clinics. Fifty-three out of an estimated 200 lipid clinics (27%) provided responses. Eighty-one percent of 53 clinics had access to lipoprotein(a) measurement. Twenty-seven clinics disclosed the number of lipoprotein(a) tests ordered annually with approximately half of the clinics (52%) requesting 0–250 tests per year. Sixty percent measured lipoprotein(a) once per patient and the leading indication was a personal or family history of premature history of cardiovascular disease in those < 60 years old. Sixty-three percent of clinics that provided comments with lipoprotein(a) results graded cardiovascular risk as per the HEART UK consensus statement. Sixty percent of clinics performed family cascade testing on lipoprotein(a) results ≥ 200 nmol/L. Lipoprotein(a) was reported in nmol/L, mg/dL, or mg/L by 48%, 24%, and 28% of responding clinics, respectively. National effort is required to provide universal access to lipoprotein(a) measurement and to harmonise the clinical application of this data.

### Assessing the accuracy of estimated lipoprotein (a) cholesterol and lipoprotein (a)-free low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [^e759a300]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Advancements in risk assessment, diagnosis, and treatment response to current and future therapies have increased the impetus for accurate measurement of the atherogenic burden of Lp(a). Currently, the reporting of Lp(a) levels varies substantially. The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine recommends Lp(a) particle number (Lp[a]‐P), an assessment of molar concentration, as the clinical standard for assessing Lp(a). However, in contemporary clinical cohorts, Lp(a) levels have often been expressed in mass concentration (mg/dL) of the entire lipoprotein particles (eg, cholesterol, esters, phospholipids, triglycerides, and apolipoproteins) to allow familiarity in evaluating cardiovascular risk.

A proposed method for estimation of Lp(a) cholesterol (Lp[a]‐C) has emerged by dividing Lp(a)‐P (in nmol/L) by a conversion factor of 2.4 to reflect mass in mg/dL and then multiplying by 30% to reflect the cholesterol content of Lp(a)., This method is of clinical interest since the calculated LDL‐C value on a standard lipid panel contains Lp(a)‐C. As such, the ability to express Lp(a)‐C as a measure of cholesterol content within Lp(a) particles may be appealing to clinicians. Comparing Lp(a)‐C with LDL‐C would provide clinicians with a qualitative understanding of the degree to which Lp(a) is contributing to the underlying atherosclerotic disease process. Moreover, assessing Lp(a)‐C might help to explain situations wherein LDL‐C reduction is less than anticipated with LDL‐targeted therapies such as statins. There is evidence that statins, by far the most used lipid‐lowering therapy, do not lower Lp(a) and in some cases may modestly increase Lp(a) levels. Since Lp(a)‐C is a component of LDL‐C, individuals with high Lp(a)‐C levels therefore may have a less‐than‐expected response to statin therapy. There has also been interest in using Lp(a)‐C to isolate the Lp(a)‐free LDL‐C component, allowing clinicians to arrive at a closer estimation of what is the "real" amount of circulating LDL‐C. Because society guidelines employ clinical rather than real LDL‐C to guide lipid therapy, we do not advocate for the use of LDL‐C correction for Lp(a)‐C. However, if inappropriately applied in this way to guide treatment decisions based on established LDL‐C targets, the perils of estimated Lp(a)‐C inaccuracies may be further amplified.

### Lp (a)-an overlooked risk factor [^17e23fd2]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is an increasingly discussed and studied risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and aortic valve stenosis. Many genetic and epidemiological studies support the important causal role that Lp(a) plays in the incidence of cardiovascular disease. Although dependent upon the threshold and unit of measurement of Lp(a), most estimates suggest between 20 and 30% of the world's population have elevated serum levels of Lp(a). Lp(a) levels are predominantly mediated by genetics and are not significantly modified by lifestyle interventions. Efforts are ongoing to develop effective pharmacotherapies to lower Lp(a) and to determine if lowering Lp(a) with these medications ultimately decreases the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events. In this review, the genetics and pathophysiological properties of Lp(a) will be discussed as well as the epidemiological data demonstrating its impact on the incidence of cardiovascular disease. Recommendations for screening and how to currently approach patients with elevated Lp(a) are also noted. Finally, the spectrum of pharmacotherapies under development for Lp(a) lowering is detailed.

### Quantifying atherogenic lipoproteins for lipid-lowering strategies: consensus-based recommendations from EAS and EFLM [^a65ff715]. Atherosclerosis (2020). Medium credibility.

The joint consensus panel of the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) and the European Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (EFLM) recently addressed present and future challenges in the laboratory diagnostics of atherogenic lipoproteins. Total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and calculated non-HDL cholesterol (= total - HDL cholesterol) constitute the primary lipid panel for estimating risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and can be measured in the nonfasting state. LDL cholesterol is the primary target of lipid-lowering therapies. For on-treatment follow-up, LDL cholesterol shall be measured or calculated by the same method to attenuate errors in treatment decisions due to marked between-method variations. Lipoprotein(a)-cholesterol is part of measured or calculated LDL cholesterol and should be estimated at least once in all patients at risk of ASCVD, especially in those whose LDL cholesterol decline poorly upon statin treatment. Residual risk of ASCVD even under optimal LDL-lowering treatment should be also assessed by non-HDL cholesterol or apolipoprotein B, especially in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia (2–10 mmol/L). Non-HDL cholesterol includes the assessment of remnant lipoprotein cholesterol and shall be reported in all standard lipid panels. Additional apolipoprotein B measurement can detect elevated LDL particle numbers often unidentified on the basis of LDL cholesterol alone. Reference intervals of lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins are reported for European men and women aged 20–100 years. However, laboratories shall flag abnormal lipid values with reference to therapeutic decision thresholds.

### Is there a need for sex-tailored lipoprotein (a) cut-off values for coronary artery disease risk stratification? [^cbf2d9e2]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discrepancies in recommendations regarding Lp(a) level cut‐offs can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, despite efforts to standardize kits and measurement methods, a global standardization of Lp(a) measurement techniques has yet to be achieved. This lack of uniformity complicates comparative analyses across different regions. Secondly, it is well‐documented that average Lp(a) levels vary significantly among different populations and ethnic groups. For instance, a study from the UK Biobank reported a median Lp(a) level of 19 nmol/L (equivalent to approximately 7.6 mg/dL based on the EAS guidelines in a predominantly White population. In contrast, our study, which also focused on a White demographic, found a slightly higher median Lp(a) level of 12 mg/dL, surpassing the levels typically observed in European cohorts. This finding aligns with prior research conducted within the Turkish population, which identified average Lp(a) levels ranging from 11 mg/dL to 15 mg/dL in the general adult population. These observations underscore the influence of ethnic and regional variations on Lp(a) levels, further complicating the establishment of a universal cut‐off threshold.

In large general population studies, Lp(a) levels have been consistently observed to be higher in women than in men, a finding that aligns with our findings. In our study, the Lp(a) level was higher in women than in men. Furthermore, even though statin treatment, which is known to be related to Lp(a) level increment, was more frequent in men, women had higher Lp(a) levels than men, similar to Odyssey Study findings.

Despite the difference in Lp(a) levels in men and women, current guidelines do not offer distinct Lp(a) level thresholds for men and women. However, observed sex‐specific variations in Lp(a) levels may hint at the potential need for sex‐specific thresholds to more accurately predict CAD. Numerous studies have highlighted that the association between Lp(a) levels and cardiovascular risk is influenced by sex. Nonetheless, research focusing on these sex differences has yielded inconsistent findings.

### Lipoprotein (a) testing trends in the United States 2015–2024: an analysis of 300 million individuals [^d59944b6]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The observed increase in Lp(a) testing over the past decade likely reflects growing awareness of its role in cardiovascular risk stratification. However, persistently low rates of testing and the variation by region, age, and race/ethnicity suggest that further efforts are needed to promote standardized Lp(a) screening guidelines nationwide. In line with current recommendations for Lp(a) testing, we observed a favorable shift in practice from using mass assays to the preferred molar assay. These findings highlight the potential for targeted educational and policy interventions to reduce disparities in cardiovascular risk assessment.

### Lipoprotein (a): a genetically determined, causal, and prevalent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^cd2b242a]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2022). Medium credibility.

High levels of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], an apoB100-containing lipoprotein, are an independent and causal risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases through mechanisms associated with increased atherogenesis, inflammation, and thrombosis. Lp(a) is predominantly a monogenic cardiovascular risk determinant, with ≈70% to ≥ 90% of interindividual heterogeneity in levels being genetically determined. The 2 major protein components of Lp(a) particles are apoB100 and apolipoprotein(a). Lp(a) remains a risk factor for cardiovascular disease development even in the setting of effective reduction of plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apoB100. Despite its demonstrated contribution to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease burden, we presently lack standardization and harmonization of assays, universal guidelines for diagnosing and providing risk assessment, and targeted treatments to lower Lp(a). There is a clinical need to understand the genetic and biological basis for variation in Lp(a) levels and its relationship to disease in different ancestry groups. This scientific statement capitalizes on the expertise of a diverse basic science and clinical workgroup to highlight the history, biology, pathophysiology, and emerging clinical evidence in the Lp(a) field. Herein, we address key knowledge gaps and future directions required to mitigate the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk attributable to elevated Lp(a) levels.

### Lipoprotein (a) as a cardiovascular risk factor: current status [^8495826a]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Epidemiology

Findings from earlier prospective studies suggest that the relation between Lp(a) concentration and the risk of CVD may involve a threshold and that the association may be more marked among individuals with elevated LDL cholesterol. – Individual studies, however, are rarely sufficiently powered to assess the shape of the relation or to make precise estimates of relative risk within subgroups of the study populations such as among individuals with high rather than low LDL cholesterol levels.

An early meta-analysis of 18 prospective studies of general populations that was published before 2000, which reported on a pooled analysis of 4000 coronary heart disease (CHD) cases, suggested that the combined relative risk of CHD for individuals in the top vs. bottom thirds of baseline Lp(a) concentrations was 1.7 (95% CI: 1.4–1.9). An updated meta-analysis of 31 prospective studies, involving a total of 9870 CHD cases, suggested that the corresponding combined risk was more modest (relative risk: 1.5; 1.3–1.8). Subgroups defined by other characteristics pre-specified for investigation, notably study size, sample storage characteristics, and Lp(a) assay isoform sensitivity, were not significantly different.

Although the evidence from literature-based meta-analyses of prospective studies suggests the potential importance of Lp(a) in CHD, it does not provide sufficient detail to allow the assessment of the relevance of this lipoprotein to CVD prevention and treatment. For example, it is not possible to determine, from a literature-based meta-analysis, whether Lp(a) is associated with CHD throughout the concentration range (similar to blood pressure and LDL cholesterol) or whether Lp(a) is particularly atherothrombogenic in specific subgroups of individuals (such as in those with high LDL cholesterol level). Re-analysis of individual participant data from a comprehensive set of prospective epidemiological studies (i.e. individual participant data meta-analysis) can help overcome several of the limitations of individual studies or literature-based meta-analyses of individual studies. However, because some of the earlier studies had problems with the correct measurement of Lp(a) in, for example, frozen samples, the risk estimates reported below should be considered minimal estimates.

Lipoprotein(a)

Lp[a] consists of an LDL particle to which apolipoprotein(a) is covalently bound. The plasma concentration of Lp(a) is largely genetically determined and is associated with an increased risk of ASCVD when elevated. The results of earlier studies suggested that levels of Lp(a) may be elevated in patients with FH. Among patients with FH, the presence of elevated Lp(a) may be associated with a 2‐fold increase in the risk of ASCVD above the already high risk of ASCVD attributable to FH alone. 43 Furthermore, a study including > 1000 children with FH whose Lp(a) levels were > 30 mg/dL (≈45 nmol/L) demonstrated a 1.45‐times higher incidence (95% CI 0.99–2.13; P = 0.05) of having a parent with FH and premature cardiovascular disease (CVD). 44 Therefore, Lp(a) levels should be measured in the initial evaluation of patients with FH. 45, 44

### Prevalence and correlates of lipoprotein (a) testing in a diverse cohort of U.S. adults [^fbb34a15]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is an apolipoprotein-B-containing lipoprotein comprised of apolipoprotein(a) and a low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-particle. Beginning at approximately 30 mg/dL (75 nmol/L), Lp(a) confers a stepwise higher risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and calcific aortic valve disease. Unlike other CVD risk factors, Lp(a) levels are approximately 70% to 90% genetically determined, affording a unique opportunity to assess a component of heritable CVD risk without genotyping. Despite the high prevalence of elevated Lp(a) (affecting 1 in 5 individuals), its strong genetic determinism, and its well-established associations with CVD and calcific aortic valve disease, Lp(a) testing is not routinely performed in the United States.

A recent 2024 National Lipid Associationconsensus document recommends once-per-lifetime measurement of Lp(a), evolving from the most recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2018 Management of Blood Cholesterol Guidelineand 2019 Primary Prevention Guideline, which recommended more selective testing of Lp(a). Despite these recommendations, Lp(a) assays are insufficiently standardized, and testing is infrequently performed. For example, results from academic medical centers in California demonstrated that < 1% of adults are tested for Lp(a). Importantly, national-level estimates for Lp(a) testing have not been reported and the factors associated with real-world Lp(a) testing are largely unidentified.

While one of the major limitations in implementing guideline-based testing of Lp(a) has been a lack of standardization in assays, clinical and socioeconomic factors may also be important barriers to consider with respect to equitably initiating Lp(a) testing. Prior findings have identified demographic factors and medical history associated with Lp(a) testing; however, these studies have primarily focused on single academic medical centers and have not broadly assessed the socioeconomic factors that may influence Lp(a) testing patterns. Therefore, we sought to assess the prevalence and factors associated with real-world Lp(a) testing in the All of Us study, a diverse contemporary cohort and national health database platform.

### Lipoprotein (a) and secondary prevention of atherothrombotic events: a critical appraisal [^c3eef176]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2018). Low credibility.

Elevated plasma concentrations of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] are an independent, and possibly causal, risk factor for atherothrombotic diseases including coronary heart disease. The principal evidence base for this comes from large population studies focusing on first atherothrombotic events. However, inconsistent findings have been reported from studies investigating the impact of elevated Lp(a) on atherothrombotic events in subjects with preexisting cardiovascular disease. This question is very important because the secondary prevention population is recommended for Lp(a) screening by some guidelines and could be an important target group for Lp(a)-lowering therapies that are currently on the horizon. In this review, we survey the secondary prevention literature as it relates to Lp(a) and identify some possible confounding factors that may underlie the inconsistent findings, such as index event bias.

### Independence of lipoprotein (a) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-mediated cardiovascular risk: a participant-level meta-analysis [^ebe5ac2a]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Third, the demonstration of a continuous association between Lp(a) level and cardiovascular risk calls into question the current paradigm of using a threshold of 50 mg/dL as recommended in some guidelines, which has important implications for risk assessment. The 50-mg/dL threshold was based on the 80th percentile of a Danish population of 6000 individuals, and was not necessarily defined by pathophysiologic risk of ASCVD events. It is also well established that the prevalence of elevated Lp(a) level differs markedly by race and ethnicity, so that using a single cutoff may not be broadly representative globally. It also does not discriminate risk on the basis of whether individuals are categorized as being treated for primary or secondary prevention. Unlike for LDL-C, in which the relative risk reduction appears to be similar in primary and secondary prevention, this will not be established for Lp(a) until the completion of cardiovascular outcomes trials evaluating targeted Lp(a) therapeutics. We demonstrate in a large meta-analysis of randomized trials that Lp(a) and LDL-C are independent and additive for cardiovascular risk as the risks associated with each were not modified by the other, and multiplicative interaction tests were nonsignificant. These findings emphasize the need for more widespread Lp(a) testing and for aggressive management of patients with elevated Lp(a) level. Further study is needed to understand the economic implications of this, particularly given the high prevalence of elevated Lp(a) levels and potential for novel therapies soon. However, Lp(a) testing is relatively inexpensive, and only needs to be performed once in most individuals. In addition, given the high burden of disease associated with elevated Lp(a) level, particularly premature cardiovascular disease, it is possible that the upfront investment in more aggressive management will reduce downstream costs associated with worse cardiovascular outcomes.

The Role of Other Atherogenic Lipids

Beyond LDL‐C, elevated levels of other atherogenic lipids contribute to an individual's ASCVD risk. For example, elevated lipoprotein(a) is a genetically determined, independent, causal risk factor for ASCVD. Current AHA/ACC/Multisociety guidelines recommend consideration of a lipoprotein(a) level ≥ 50 mg/dL (or ≥ 125 nmol/L) if measured as a risk‐enhancing factor to guide statin initiation in those at borderline or intermediate risk of ASCVD events. Guidance on how to incorporate lipoprotein(a) concentration into a person's 10‐year ASCVD risk has also recently been provided within a statement from the AHA. Statins do not lower lipoprotein(a) and, in some studies, have been associated with increased lipoprotein(a) levels among recipients. Consequently, clinicians should be aware that elevated lipoprotein(a) remains an important contributor to ASCVD risk in the setting of LDL‐C lowering with statins.

In addition to lipoprotein(a), triglyceride‐rich lipoproteins (which are reflected in measures such as non–high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol and remnant cholesterol) contribute to lipid‐related risk for ASCVD. Persistent elevations of triglycerides ≥ 175 mg/dL are recognized as a risk‐enhancing factor in the AHA/ACC/Multisociety guidelines.

### Assessing the accuracy of estimated lipoprotein (a) cholesterol and lipoprotein (a)-free low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [^ba724cd0]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Lp(a) mass > 50 mg/dL is a commonly cited threshold for increased atherogenic outcomes. Applying the conversion factor of 30% between total Lp(a) mass and cholesterol component would imply that, by extension, within the context of previous population studies, Lp(a)‐C levels of > 15 mg/dL carry increased atherogenic risk. In our data set, we found that nearly all individuals with estimated Lp(a)‐C > 10 mg/dL, capturing those at this clinically significant threshold and beyond, had significant error when compared with measured values.

Given the degree of inaccuracy, estimations using mass concentration measurements, including Lp(a)‐free LDL‐C, may be misleading. The overestimation of Lp(a)‐C can be problematic when using said estimations to further stratify a patient's LDL‐C burden, ie, when calculating measures such as Lp(a)‐free LDL‐C. The clinical rationale for estimating Lp(a)‐free LDL‐C lies in the demand for quantifying the contribution of Lp(a)‐C within LDL‐C estimations by standard lipid panels. Given the inaccuracies in estimating Lp(a)‐C using fixed molar‐to‐mass conversion factors as shown in our study, estimated Lp(a)‐free LDL‐C had similarly poor correlation with measured VAP Lp(a)‐free LDL‐C. In addition, because Lp(a)‐C overall was overestimated, by extension, Lp(a)‐free LDL‐C was consistently underestimated relative to VAP Lp(a)‐free LDL‐C. As a result, the clinical application of Lp(a)‐free LDL‐C may underestimate LDL‐C and lead to undertreatment. In our data set, we found that individuals with estimated Lp(a)‐C > 10 mg/dL had underestimated Lp(a)‐free LDL‐C; these individuals are already at higher risk of ASCVD outcomes given the commonly cited risk threshold for Lp(a) mass of 50 mg/dL (which would correlate to an Lp[a]‐C of 15 mg/dL). This is especially notable since the primary mode of treating patients with high Lp(a) is to maximally intensify LDL‐lowering therapy, often past guideline‐directed targets. Thus, the application of estimated Lp(a)‐free LDL‐C to clinical LDL‐C targets has potential for undertreatment of LDL‐C for this high‐risk population who should be on maximally aggressive lipid‐lowering therapy. Fortunately, existing major society guidelines do not make recommendations to tailor therapies based on this measure, instead focusing on LDL cholesterol alone.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^52e1f70b]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 1.3 — lipoprotein testing in hypertriglyceridemia states: We recommend against the routine measurement of lipoprotein particle heterogeneity in patients with hypertriglyceridemia (1⊕⊕⊕○). We suggest that measurement of apoB or Lp(a) levels can be of value, whereas measurement of other apolipoprotein levels has little clinical value (2⊕⊕○○). Supporting evidence notes it is not necessary to measure LDL size or density; however, measurement of non-HDL cholesterol and/or apoB levels can indicate the presence of increased numbers of LDL particles, and several reports also show that measurement of apoB is superior to measurement of LDL or even non-HDL cholesterol as an indicator of global CVD risk. Epidemiologic studies have not provided conclusive evidence that measurement of HDL size contributes to risk prediction, and for these reasons, assessment of lipoprotein heterogeneity is not recommended in the assessment of hypertriglyceridemia. Regarding Lp(a), studies over the past decade have confirmed and more robustly demonstrated a risk factor role for cardiovascular disease; however, there are limited treatment options to alter its level and a current lack of outcome evidence supporting its use as a specific therapeutic target.

The European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) Lipid Clinics Network promoted a survey in order to identify and understand how and when lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is tested and clinically evaluated in lipid clinics throughout Europe, and the challenges that may prevent evaluation from being carried out.

Methods

This survey was divided into three areas of inquiry: background and clinical setting information of clinicians, questions for doctors who claimed not to measure Lp(a), in order to understand what were the reasons for not ordering the test, and questions for doctors who measure Lp(a), to investigate the use of this value in the management of patients.

Results

A total of 151 centres clinicians filled in the survey, out of 226 invited. The proportion of clinicians who declare to routinely measure Lp(a) in clinical practice was 75.5%. The most common reasons for not ordering the Lp(a) test were the lack of reimbursement or of treatment options, the non-availability of Lp(a) test, and the high cost of performing the laboratory test. The availability of therapies targeting this lipoprotein would result in a greater propensity of clinicians to start testing Lp(a). Among those who declared to routinely measure Lp(a), the Lp(a) measurement is mostly requested to further stratify patients' cardiovascular risk, and half of them recognized 50 mg/dL (approx. 110 nmol/L) as the threshold for increased cardiovascular risk due.

Conclusions

These results warrant for a great deal of effort from scientific societies to address the barriers that limit the routine use of the measurement of Lp(a) concentration and to recognise the importance of Lp(a) as a risk factor.

### Association of lipoprotein (a) levels with incidence of major adverse limb events [^f22be338]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

The Lp(a) level thresholds we selected may be debated. We chose less than 50 mg/dL as the upper limit of normal level to be in line with the 2018 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association Guideline on the Management of Blood Cholesterol and the European Atherosclerosis Society consensus statement about Lp(a), in which a level greater than 50 mg/dL was considered to be a factor associated with enhanced risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. For the choice of the threshold to define extreme Lp(a) levels, the 2019 European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society Guidelines for the Management of Dyslipidaemias recommended considering 1 lifetime Lp(a) measurement to detect patients with extreme Lp(a) levels (> 180 mg/dL). This guideline was based on a Mendelian randomization study suggesting that extreme Lp(a) levels increased atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk similarly to the levels in people with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Because a recent study did not have enough power to assess the association between extreme Lp(a) levels and the need for a peripheral artery revascularization, we took advantage of the large size of the present cohort to establish the 95th percentile Lp(a) level (≥ 134 mg/dL) as the very high level category, which was proposed in several studies. The very high level category was associated with major adverse limb event risk in this cohort. Moreover, the association between Lp(a) and major adverse limb event incidence remained significant after adjustment for history of ischemic heart disease or history of stroke in the sensitivity analyses, and with PAD being the main factor associated with major adverse limb event. Beyond indicating the Lp(a) level associated with MI and coronary heart disease, these results reinforce the potential association of Lp(a) with improved lower-limb vascular risk.

### Lipoprotein (a) in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and aortic stenosis: a European Atherosclerosis Society consensus statement [^e333edd3]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This 2022 EAS consensus statement updates evidence relating to the associations of Lp(a) and ASCVD, strongly reinforcing recommendations from clinical guidelines and its inclusion in global risk estimation. Improved standardization of Lp(a) measurement, together with implementation using models of care possibly based on those of FH, are key.

However, gaps in our knowledge about Lp(a) remain (Box 2). A critical question is whether lowering elevated Lp(a), against a background of well controlled LDL-C levels, reduces cardiovascular events; insights from the Lp(a)HORIZON trial are crucial. Finally, investigating the potential of Lp(a) lowering to reduce AVS progression is a priority, given the urgent and escalating unmet clinical need in this setting.

Box 2.
Critical knowledge gaps in the Lp(a) field

Many aspects of the genetic regulation of Lp(a) are not fully understood. Identification of causal variants and the mechanisms by which they modulate Lp(a) concentration or enhance Lp(a) pathogenicity require further research.
Better understanding of the pathogenicity of the various moieties of Lp(a) particles is a priority.
Investigation of the mechanisms underlying the link between very low Lp(a) concentration and the development of diabetes mellitus is needed.
Standardization and harmonization of Lp(a) measurement needs to be improved.
Studies in larger samples of different ethnicities are needed.
Whether Lp(a) lowering reverses accelerated atherogenesis and AVS progression and reduces cardiovascular events has to be tested. The extent of Lp(a) lowering required for clinical benefit is also not known.

4 Discussion

Our study provided valuable insights into Lp(a) levels among a large Turkish cohort. In the study group, the median Lp(a) level was 12 mg/dL, and Lp(a) was an independent predictor of CAD for the entire cohort. Women exhibited higher Lp(a) levels than men. Despite Lp(a) level being higher in women, Lp(a) cut‐off level of ≥ 30 mg/dL was a predictor of CAD only in women; however, both men and women with Lp(a) levels of ≥ 50 mg/dL were found to be at increased risk for CAD.

Elevated levels of Lp(a) are widely recognized as a significant risk factor for CAD. Previous large‐scale population studies have demonstrated that Lp(a) levels are generally higher in women than in men, raising questions about potential sex differences in the Lp(a)‐CAD relationship. Our findings indicate that elevated Lp(a) levels are associated with CAD in both sexes, suggesting that the risk posed by high Lp(a) levels transcends sex differences. Specifically, in our cohort, patients with CAD, irrespective of being male or female, exhibited higher Lp(a) levels. This observation may underscore the importance of considering elevated Lp(a) levels as a critical risk factor for CAD across both sexes.

While the association between Lp(a) levels and CAD is well‐established, the specific threshold of Lp(a) that accurately predicts CAD risk remains ambiguous. A significant meta‐analysis demonstrated that an Lp(a) level exceeding 30 mg/dL is associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease, irrespective of sex differences. Current guidelines, however, propose varying Lp(a) thresholds for identifying high‐risk individuals. The ACC/AHA, CCS, and the National Lipid Association (NLA) all recognize 50 mg/dL (or > 100 nmol/L) as a risk‐enhancing cut‐off. Conversely, the EAS consensus statement delineates < 30 mg/dL (or < 75 nmol/L) as normal, 30–50 mg/dL (or 75–125 nmol/L) as intermediate, and ≥ 50 mg/dL (or > 125 nmol/L) as indicative of an abnormal level.

### Lipoprotein (a) levels in children with suspected familial hypercholesterolaemia: a cross-sectional study [^7002422d]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disorder of lipoprotein metabolism that affects around 1 in 310 individuals. It is caused by mutations in the LDLR, APOB, or PCSK9 genes that lead to impaired clearance of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) from the circulation and, consequently, very high LDL-C levels from birth onwards. If left untreated, early signs of atherosclerosis can already be observed in childhood, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis and treatment initiation.

The preferred method for diagnosing FH is genetic testing. In many countries, however, FH is often diagnosed clinically with the use of diagnostic tools such as the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network Criteria (DLCNC). In children, on the other hand, these tools are not validated, and consequently, genetic testing is even more important for diagnosing FH in the paediatric population. However, even when DNA analysis is performed, a considerable group of children remain with a clinical presentation (or phenotypic/clinical diagnosis) of FH in whom no FH-causing mutation can be found, suggesting that other factors may underlie this clinical presentation. In fact, several adult studies have shown that a considerable part of the clinical diagnoses of FH could be explained by high lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] levels.

Elevated Lp(a) is a genetic risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), independent of conventional risk factors such as LDL-C. With a population prevalence of approximately 20%, it is one of the most prevalent inherited dyslipidaemias. Despite no pharmacological treatment for lowering Lp(a) levels being available in children, measuring Lp(a) levels is important to allow further optimization of other CVD risk factors, including a more aggressive lowering of LDL-C and lifelong adoption of a healthy lifestyle. Due to the LDL-like core of Lp(a), conventional LDL-C assays capture both the cholesterol content of LDL particles and of Lp(a) particles, and thus, if Lp(a) levels are high, measured LDL-C levels can be elevated as well. As a result, FH may be clinically diagnosed, while it is actually high Lp(a) levels that underlie this presentation. Yet this is mainly based on adult data, and whether high Lp(a) levels may underlie a clinical presentation of FH in children is unknown. Therefore, we compared Lp(a) levels of children with a clinical presentation of FH in whom no mutation was found to Lp(a) levels of both children with an FH-causing mutation and their unaffected siblings.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: algorithm for management of adults with dyslipidemia-2025 update [^dc863ba0]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

Cardiovascular risk assessment and testing — For primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), AACE recommends that adults with dyslipidemia be assessed using a validated risk assessment tool, and we recommend that all individuals (primary and secondary prevention) be counseled on enduring lifestyle changes to address lipid and nonlipid ASCVD risk factors. Adults with ASCVD do not need risk assessment because they are already considered to be at high risk and should receive treatment for secondary prevention. Adults ≥ 40 years of age (or younger if additional ASCVD risk factors are present) with diabetes, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) diagnosis, HIV, metabolic syndrome, metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and chronic inflammatory diseases may be considered at moderate to high risk for ASCVD and should be managed accordingly. For most adults, the routine use of nontraditional risk markers including coronary artery calcium (CAC) score, apolipoprotein B (ApoB), and lipoprotein a (Lp[a]) does not provide meaningful improvement in risk prediction; however, special consideration that incorporates costs and benefits may be given to these markers and potentially to genetic testing in young adults with a family history of premature ASCVD.

### Lipoprotein (a) testing in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in 5 large US health systems [^61ffbc67]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Across 5 large US health systems, the frequency of lipoprotein (a) testing among patients with ASCVD remains low, at 0.4%. Additionally, disparities exist as older and Black individuals were particularly unlikely to have a lipoprotein (a) test. Those with lipoprotein (a) testing were more likely to initiate any LLT regardless of lipoprotein (a) level, including statins, compared with those without lipoprotein (a) testing. Initiation of LLT was higher among those with a lipoprotein (a) test and elevated levels, though driven mostly by nonstatin therapies like ezetimibe and PCSK9i. In general, the overall initiation of LLT remained low in this population, despite clear guideline indications for LLT in patients with ASCVD. Thus, there is a critical need for multidisciplinary and inclusive approaches to raise awareness of lipoprotein (a) testing and its implications for aggressive preventive management. Such awareness may increase if lipoprotein (a)–lowering therapies, which are currently being tested, are shown to provide clinical benefit.

### Lipoprotein (a) levels in disaggregated racial and ethnic subgroups across atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk levels [^dd00ce15]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and sample

This is a retrospective cohort study of individuals who received care through a large California health system. Eligible individuals were at least 18 years old, had ≥ 2 primary care appointments on different dates between the years 2010 to 2021, and underwent Lp(a) testing. If an individual underwent Lp(a) testing more than once during the study period, only the first test was included, and the date of the first Lp(a) test was defined as the index date. Individuals without complete race or ethnicity data were excluded.

Lp(a) levels were reported in mg/dL and the date of Lp(a) testing was considered as the index date for all other covariates. The following Lp(a) thresholds were used due to clinical significance: < 30 mg/dL (upper limit of normal for the Lp(a) assay), 30 mg/dL to < 50 mg/dL (abnormal level, but not a risk-enhancing factor), 50 mg/dL to < 70 mg/dL (considered a risk-enhancing factor by clinical practice guidelines), and ≥ 70 mg/dL (significantly elevated and currently studied as a threshold for targeted Lp(a) lowering trials).

The study was approved by the Sutter Health and Stanford University Institutional Review Boards.

Progressive atherosclerosis or recurrent events despite evidence-based therapy — NLA Expert Panel consensus emphasizes that "little evidence is available from RCTs" to guide such patients on high-intensity statins; "very aggressive therapy to lower atherogenic cholesterol levels to values well below goal thresholds may be considered," although "this approach is not clearly supported by clinical trial evidence." Additional evaluation "such as an elevated level of Lp(a) or other additional risk indicators may be warranted," and "nonlipid risk factors should be well controlled in such patients."

### Lipoprotein (a) serum concentrations in children in relation to body mass index, age and sex [^64170822]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

High lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) serum concentrations are an independent risk marker of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and aortic valve stenosis in adults. Lp(a) exerts pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic effects, increasing the risk for early onset of ASCVD and aortic valve stenosis. Up to 90% of the variation in Lp(a) plasma levels is genetically determined, and Lp(a) plasma levels are minimally impacted by lifestyle or oral lipid-lowering therapies. In adults, a single measurement is recommended to determine an individual's Lp(a) associated risk: < 30 mg/dL for no risk, 30- < 50 mg/dL for the interim gray zone, and ≥ 50 mg/dL for clear Lp(a) associated risk. Lp(a) has emerged as an excellent parameter for risk stratification and for family screening in adults. Thus, the current guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) recommend measuring Lp(a) in every individual once in a lifetime. In contrast to adults, information on Lp(a) serum concentration in children is limited, and it is unknown whether Lp(a) screening in children would likewise identify individuals at increased risk of ASCVD. – Early detection and treatment of dyslipidemias are crucial for the primary prevention of lifelong exposure of vessel walls to pathogenic lipoproteins, preventing the development of ASCVD that likely starts in childhood. There is accumulating evidence that elevated Lp(a) levels are present from an early age.

One subgroup of children which is especially vulnerable to cardiovascular disease is obese children. Childhood obesity is associated with hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia and premature death in adulthood. In the light of the increasing prevalence of childhood obesity worldwide, the effects of body mass index (BMI) on markers for ASCVD risk become increasingly important. It is incompletely understood whether Lp(a) serum levels in children are affected by factors such as BMI, age or sex. These questions are of clinical relevance because a stable biomarker in childhood would potentially allow for a general screening program in children and offer the possibility of reverse family screening to identify other family members at risk, such as parents, at an early age. We therefore examined Lp(a) serum concentrations in obese children of a large prospective population-based cohort and a healthy matched control group. In addition, we tested whether Lp(a) serum levels were associated with sex, age and cholesterol levels.

AACE dyslipidemia risk assessment and LDL-C targets — For primary prevention in adults with dyslipidemia, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) recommends the use of a validated tool or calculator to predict future risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events as part of shared decision-making and notes limited utility in broad application of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores, apolipoprotein B (ApoB), and lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] measurements, though additional testing may be considered for intermediate-risk individuals; for those undergoing pharmacotherapy who have ASCVD or are at increased risk, AACE suggests for treatment to an LDL-C target of < 70 mg/dL, acknowledging that prior lower targets (< 55 mg/dL) were informed by a single ezetimibe trial and meta-analyses did not show differences in cardiovascular events or mortality.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^84f77882]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) in youth — composition, measurement, and risk/epidemiology: Lp(a) is an LDL–C particle with apoB linked to apo(a) and is best measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with an upper limit of normal of 75 nanomoles per liter. In adults, higher Lp(a) may be an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease, pulmonary vascular disease, ischemic stroke, and aortic aneurysm, and elevated levels particularly contribute to risk when combined with high LDL–C. In the Bogalusa study, Lp(a) was measured in 2,438 children and mean levels were 1.7 times higher in African Americans than Whites; among White children, parental myocardial infarction was associated with higher Lp(a), but not among African American children. A family study of 1,002 household members of 282 White pediatric patients with first acute ischemic stroke found significant heritability estimates for Lp(a), and in children with stroke, Lp(a) is significantly elevated in about half of cases with either ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke.

### Consensus panel recommendation for incorporating lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 testing into cardiovascular disease risk assessment guidelines [^57b22147]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

A consensus panel was formed to review the rapidly emerging literature on the vascular-specific inflammatory marker lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A(2) (Lp-PLA(2)) and to update recommendations for the appropriate use of this novel biomarker in clinical practice. The recommendations of the panel build on guidelines of the Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) and the American Heart Association/Centers for Disease Control (AHA/CDC) for cardiovascular risk assessment. Consistent with the ATP III guideline recommendations for the use of inflammatory markers, Lp-PLA(2) is recommended as an adjunct to traditional risk assessment in patients at moderate and high 10-year risk. A simplified framework for traditional Framingham risk factor assessment is proposed. As a highly specific biomarker for vascular inflammation, elevated Lp-PLA(2) levels should prompt consideration of increasing the cardiovascular risk category from moderate to high or high to very high risk, respectively. Because intensification of lifestyle changes and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol lowering is beneficial in high-risk patients, regardless of baseline LDL cholesterol levels, consideration should be given to lowering the LDL cholesterol target by 30 mg/dL (1 mg/dL = 0.02586 mmol/L) in patients with high levels of Lp-PLA(2). Lp-PLA(2) is recommended as a diagnostic test for vascular inflammation to better identify patients at high or very high risk who will benefit from intensification of lipid-modifying therapies. However, at this time Lp-PLA(2) cannot be recommended as a target of therapy.

### Lipoprotein (a): perspectives from a lipid-referral program [^06d1af1c]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] has a strong association with coronary disease (CHD). We evaluated the implications of implementing a niacin strategy in persons above low risk by the Framingham risk score (FRS).

Methods

Patients referred to a university lipid management program from January 2004 to June 2010 had an Lp(a) level measured at initial evaluation. Factors associated with an increase in Lp(a) and predictors of a high risk Lp(a) (≥ 50 mg/dL) were assessed. FRS and Lp(a) levels were used to assess eligibility for niacin with an Lp(a) ≥ 50 mg/dL.

Results

A total of 692 patients (57% male, mean age 52 ± 14 years) had a mean Lp(a) of 32 ± 40 mg/dL. In a multiple logistic regression model, African-American race, female gender, presence of CHD, and lower triglyceride levels were significant predictors of high risk Lp(a). Ten percent were determined to be intermediate and 44% high risk by FRS. A total of 9% of intermediate- and 26% of high-risk patients had an Lp(a) ≥ 50 mg/dL, and 84% were not taking niacin. A total of 19% of moderate- and high-risk patients were eligible for initiation of niacin based upon values ≥ 50 mg/dL. If niacin were also used for an high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ≤ 40 mg/dL, only 5.1% additional patients would require niacin.

Conclusion

High-risk levels of Lp(a) are associated with female gender, African- American race, and CHD. 19% of moderate and high risk patients would be candidates for treatment with niacin if the indication is a cutpoint Lp(a) ≥ 50 mg/dL.

### Prevalence of elevated Lp (a) mass levels and patient thresholds in 532 359 patients in the United States [^983b1a3c]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Elevated lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a causal, independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and aortic stenosis. We aimed to define the prevalence and patient thresholds of elevated Lp(a) levels in the United States.

Approach and Results

We analyzed Lp(a) levels in 532359 subjects from 2 data sets: (1) in 531144 subjects from a referral laboratory and (2) in 915 patients from a tertiary referral center. Lp(a) mass levels were measured by immunoturbidometric assays in both centers and expressed as mg/dL. At the referral laboratory, the median age (interquartile range) of the subjects was 57.0 (46–67) years, and 51.9% were female. Lp(a) levels were skewed rightward as expected. The mean ± SD levels were 34.0 ± 40.0 mg/dL, and median (interquartile range) levels were 17 (7–47) mg/dL, with range 0 to 907 mg/dL. Lp(a) levels at 75%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 99%, and 99.9% percentiles were > 47, > 60, > 90, > 116, > 180, and > 245 mg/dL, respectively. At the referral laboratory, Lp(a) levels > 30 and > 50 mg/dL were present in 35.0% and 24.0% of subjects, respectively, and at the tertiary referral center, 39.5% and 29.2%, respectively. Females had higher mean (SD) (37.0 [42.7] versus 30.7 [36.7]; P < 0.0001) and median (interquartile range) (19 [8–53] versus 15 [7–42]; P < 0.0001) Lp(a) than males.

Conclusions

This is the largest database to assess the distribution of Lp(a) and is derived from patients as opposed to general populations. Lp(a) levels > 30 and > 50 mg/dL were fairly common, particularly in a tertiary care setting. These data may inform consensus documents, guidelines, and therapeutic cutoffs for Lp(a)-mediated cardiovascular risk.

### Global lipoprotein (a) testing trends from 2015 to 2023 [^cc7f2cf1]. American Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] is a known cardiovascular disease risk factor. Recent guidelines recommend Lp(a) testing once in all individuals, especially in those with premature cardiovascular disease, and family history of cardiovascular disease. Emerging Lp(a) lowering therapies have the potential to mitigate this risk. However, the current global trends in Lp(a) testing remain unknown. This study aimed to evaluate global patterns in Lp(a) testing over the past decade, including trends in high-risk and key demographic subgroups.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX Global Collaborative Network and identified comorbidities using the International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision, and Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes. Study population included adults age (≥ 18 years) who underwent Lp(a) testing between January 2015 and December 2023. We assessed annual trends in Lp(a) testing overall and in high-risk subgroups, including coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral artery disease (PAD), ischemic stroke, heart failure (HF), family history of CAD, carotid artery stenosis, and aortic stenosis.

Results

141 million patients from 144 healthcare organizations were included. Lp(a) testing was conducted in 175,853 patients, with a mean age of 59.0 ± 16.9 years, 50% women and 63% white adults. Overall Lp(a) testing increased nominally from 0.009% in 2015 to 0.032% in 2023. Among different high risk subgroups, Lp(a) testing was also considerably low and only had a modest gradual increase between 2015 to 2023 (CAD: 0.24% to 0.85%; PAD: 0.20% to 0.42%; Ischemic stroke: 0.61% to 0.71%; HF: 0.19% to 0.51%; Family history of CAD: 0.24% to 1.29%; Carotid artery stenosis: 0.37% to 0.90%; Aortic stenosis: 0.18% to 0.56%). In 2023, all subgroups had < 1% Lp(a) testing, except those with family history of CAD.

Conclusion

Global Lp(a) testing rates remain low overall and in high risk subgroups, emphasizing the need for education and implementation of guideline-recommended testing and risk stratification.
