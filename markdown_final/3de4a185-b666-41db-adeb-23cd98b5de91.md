## Question

hypertension in elderly management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about managing hypertension in older adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the older adult population and stratifying by age and frailty. Then, I should verify accurate blood pressure measurement techniques and confirm true hypertension. Next, I will evaluate comorbidities, cognitive status, and frailty. After that, I should review the evolving evidence on blood pressure targets and reconcile guideline differences. Then, I will select pharmacologic strategies and safety considerations. I should also incorporate lifestyle therapy, special situations like isolated systolic hypertension and resistant hypertension, and finally build a monitoring and deprescribing plan, all while integrating shared decision-making and practical implementation steps.

> Let me first confirm how to define the older adult population, because thresholds vary by guideline and trial, and that shapes targets and initiation. The European ESC/ESH materials typically define older as ≥ 65 years and very old as ≥ 80 years, while the U.S. context often uses ≥ 60 years for initiation thresholds, so I need to keep both conventions in mind and document which frame I am using for a given decision. I should also screen for frailty and functional status up front, as moderate-to-severe frailty, limited life expectancy, and dementia alter risk–benefit and targets, and both the 2024 ESC and 2023 ESH explicitly recommend screening for frailty and adapting management accordingly [^112t2sif] [^111URCfb].

> Wait, let me verify the blood pressure measurement strategy before I anchor on a diagnosis or target. Accurate technique matters in older adults because of higher white-coat and orthostatic effects; I should use automated office BP or validate office cuff technique, then confirm with home BP monitoring and ambulatory BP monitoring when feasible. I need to check for orthostatic hypotension routinely in older patients, even if asymptomatic, and consider down-titration if symptomatic orthostasis or very low DBP is present, because orthostatic hypotension and low DBP predict falls and adverse events with intensification [^11354SU4] [^114EJM8P] [^113wtwkq].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about starting medication before I confirm the diagnosis and stage hypertension. I should double-check that office BP is ≥ 140/90 mmHg on at least two occasions, and then consider HMOD such as LVH, CKD, or retinopathy, plus ASCVD risk, because high-risk older adults accrue the largest absolute benefit from BP lowering even though their baseline risk is higher. I need to ensure secondary contributors like CKD, OSA, renal artery stenosis, and medication-induced hypertension are not overlooked, especially in the very old, because they can modify both targets and drug choice [^113AXENT] [^112JWsw7].

> I will now examine comorbidities and cognitive/functional status carefully, because these shape targets and monitoring cadence. Frailty scales, gait speed, and activities of daily living help me classify patients into fit, vulnerable, or frail strata; for fit adults, I can apply standard evidence-based targets, but for frail patients I should consider higher, individualized targets or even deprescribing if low BP or polypharmacy risk emerges. Limited life expectancy under three years or severe dementia warrants lenient targets and shared decisions focused on comfort and function rather than hard outcomes, and I should confirm this with the patient and caregivers [^112t2sif] [^11494kgs] [^114dN73y].

> Let me consider the evolving evidence on targets before I align with any single guideline. SPRINT in adults ≥ 75 showed about a 33% reduction in major CV events and mortality with intensive control to < 120 mmHg, albeit with more hypotension and AKI, so the benefit signal is strong but requires vigilance. HYVET demonstrated mortality and HF benefits treating to < 150 mmHg in the very old. The STEP trial in China in adults 60–80 supports intensive SBP 110–130 mmHg reducing events versus 130–150 mmHg. BPLTTC meta-analyses suggest event reduction down to around 120/70 mmHg, but observational data and some analyses warn of higher mortality at very low achieved BP in frail or institutionalized elders, so I should reconcile these signals with patient-specific vulnerability [^114uhsuM] [^117W7gzp] [^114EkVCh] [^1169FZr7].

> Next, I should review guideline targets and reconcile differences explicitly. JNC 8 recommended initiating at ≥ 150/90 mmHg and treating to < 150/90 mmHg in adults ≥ 60, and not changing therapy if SBP drifts below 140 mmHg without adverse effects, reflecting RCTs anchored at higher baseline pressures. In contrast, ESC/ESH 2018 recommended SBP 130–139 mmHg for most ≥ 65 years, avoiding SBP < 120 mmHg, and emphasized tolerability. ESH 2023 advises < 140/80 mmHg as primary goal for 65–79 years, with consideration of < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated, and for ≥ 80 years to initiate at ≥ 160 mmHg, consider 140–160 mmHg, and target 140–150 mmHg, with 130–139 mmHg only if tolerated and DBP not too low. The 2024 ESC adds nuance for ≥ 85 years or moderate-to-severe frailty, suggesting more lenient targets such as < 140/90 mmHg and individualized initiation thresholds, which I should integrate case-by-case [^114ZcC5v] [^114FFvZw] [^111nAutN] [^112hdz3V] [^116RZYXB].

> I should double-check how to translate this into a practical, risk-stratified approach. For fit, community-dwelling adults aged 65–79, I can reasonably target < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated, recognizing that the absolute risk reduction is greatest in high-risk patients. For adults ≥ 80 who are fit, a target around 130–139 mmHg is reasonable, but if frail or with limited life expectancy, I should individualize and often accept 140–150 mmHg or higher, with close monitoring for dizziness, falls, and renal function. If on-treatment SBP is already < 120 mmHg or DBP < 70 mmHg, I should verify whether down-titration is indicated, especially with orthostatic symptoms or AKI, and avoid pushing below these thresholds in most elders [^111nAutN] [^112hdz3V] [^113jJnHm] [^114ogPHK].

> Now, I need to ensure drug selection aligns with physiology and comorbidity. In older adults, I should start low and titrate slowly, and in most non-frail patients initiate with two drugs at low dose to achieve faster, smoother control, favoring a RAS blocker plus a calcium channel blocker or thiazide depending on comorbidity. I should avoid alpha-blockers and centrally acting agents when possible due to orthostatic hypotension and falls, and be cautious with thiazides in those prone to hyponatremia or falls. For ≥ 85 years or moderate-to-severe frailty, I should prefer long-acting dihydropyridine CCBs or RAS inhibitors, add low-dose diuretics cautiously, and avoid beta-blockers unless there is a compelling indication like CAD or HFrEF, verifying tolerability at each step [^111yornR] [^114EJM8P] [^115kUczg] [^112RfEMp].

> But wait, what if the patient has isolated systolic hypertension, which is common in elders. I should confirm that SBP is the dominant driver of risk and that combination therapy is often needed to control SBP without over-lowering DBP. ESH 2023 supports using all major classes as needed, starting with two drugs in non-frail older adults with isolated systolic hypertension, and cautiously lowering SBP toward 130–139 mmHg if DBP is not already < 70 mmHg, which helps me balance stroke risk reduction against cerebral perfusion concerns [^1169vq6x] [^112hdz3V].

> I need to check lifestyle therapy and ensure it is feasible and safe. Sodium restriction, weight loss if overweight, increased physical activity, moderation of alcohol, and smoking cessation all reduce BP and medication needs, but I should tailor intensity to frailty and comorbidity. Home BP monitoring improves control and safety, and I should train patients and caregivers to track readings and symptoms, especially after changes, to detect hypotension or orthostasis early [^112AjyiP] [^116eiBQs].

> Next, I should review special situations. In resistant hypertension, I must verify adherence, screen for secondary causes, and consider adding spironolactone or switching to chlorthalidone if not already used, while watching potassium and renal function closely. In diabetes or CKD, lower targets are reasonable if tolerated, but again I should avoid SBP < 120 mmHg or DBP < 70 mmHg in frail elders and monitor eGFR and electrolytes frequently when intensifying therapy [^113jJnHm] [^112gDYYh].

> I will now examine monitoring and safety cadence. After any initiation or uptitration, I should reassess in 2–4 weeks with home BP logs, orthostatic vitals, renal function, and electrolytes, then extend intervals as stable. I should maintain a low threshold to check for orthostatic hypotension at every visit, and if low SBP or symptomatic orthostasis emerges, I should down-titrate or deprescribe, documenting shared decision-making and functional goals. For patients with limited life expectancy or high frailty, I should align targets with comfort, cognition, and autonomy rather than hard cardiovascular endpoints [^114EJM8P] [^114ogPHK] [^114dN73y].

> Hold on, I should verify that my plan is consistent with the highest-quality evidence and current guideline evolution. The weight of randomized data supports more intensive SBP lowering down to approximately 120–130 mmHg for many older adults, with the largest absolute benefit in high-risk patients, but frailty, orthostatic hypotension, and limited life expectancy shift the balance toward individualized, more lenient targets. The 2024 ESC and 2023 ESH guidance operationalize this by recommending frailty screening, lenient targets for ≥ 85 or limited lifespan, and explicit cautions about very low BP, which I should integrate into routine care and revisit periodically as function changes [^114uhsuM] [^11494kgs] [^112t2sif] [^116RZYXB].

> Finally, I need to ensure shared decision-making is documented and revisited. I should explain the likely benefits and potential harms of intensification, including fall risk, electrolyte disturbances, and AKI, and incorporate patient preferences, caregiver input, and functional priorities into the target and drug choices. If the patient values symptom control and independence over marginal cardiovascular risk reduction, I should adjust the regimen accordingly and set measurable, patient-centered goals that we review together at each visit [^112DK389] [^112t2sif] [^114dN73y].

Hypertension management in older adults should be **individualized** to balance cardiovascular benefit with risks such as falls, cognitive decline, and polypharmacy [^112Av3as]. Most guidelines recommend a **target SBP of 130–139 mmHg** for adults ≥ 65 years if tolerated, with more lenient targets (< 140/90 mmHg) for those ≥ 85 years, frail, or with limited life expectancy [^116Zo9hx] [^116RZYXB] [^11494kgs]. Initiate pharmacotherapy at **≥ 150 mmHg** in adults ≥ 60 years, and consider **≥ 140 mmHg** in high-risk patients; use low starting doses and titrate slowly, monitoring for orthostatic hypotension and kidney function [^114ZcC5v] [^1139ZnH6] [^112RfEMp]. Combination therapy is often required, and lifestyle measures should be emphasized [^111yornR] [^116eiBQs]. Regular reassessment for adverse effects, adherence, and frailty is essential to adjust therapy and maintain quality of life [^112DK389] [^112t2sif].

## Blood pressure targets in older adults

Blood pressure targets in older adults vary by **age, frailty, and comorbidities**:

| **Patient group** | **Recommended SBP target** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| General population ≥ 65 years | 130–139 mmHg (if tolerated) | High |
| Very elderly (≥ 85 years) or frail patients | < 140/90 mmHg (personalized, more lenient) | High |
| High-risk patients (CVD, CKD, diabetes) | < 130/80 mmHg (if tolerated) | Moderate |

---

These targets **balance cardiovascular benefit with the risks** of hypotension, falls, and cognitive decline [^114FFvZw] [^114EJM8P].

---

## Pharmacological management

### Initiation thresholds

Initiate pharmacotherapy at **≥ 150 mmHg** for adults ≥ 60 years, and consider **≥ 140 mmHg** for high-risk patients or those with compelling indications [^114ZcC5v] [^1139ZnH6].

---

### First-line antihypertensive agents

- **Calcium channel blockers (CCBs)**: Effective, well tolerated, and preferred in older adults, especially with isolated systolic hypertension [^111eaQQZ].
- **Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)**: Beneficial in patients with diabetes, CKD, or heart failure [^115CjvEw].
- **Thiazide-like diuretics**: Effective, but monitor for electrolyte disturbances and renal function [^116eiBQs].

---

### Combination therapy

Combination therapy is often required to achieve targets; **start low and titrate slowly** to minimize adverse effects [^111yornR] [^112RfEMp].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Lifestyle modifications are **foundational** and can reduce medication needs:

- **Dietary sodium restriction**: < 2.3 g/day.
- **Weight loss**: BMI 18.5–24.9 kg/m².
- **Regular physical activity**: ≥ 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity exercise.
- **Alcohol moderation**: ≤ 1 drink/day (women), ≤ 2 drinks/day (men).
- **Smoking cessation**: Strongly recommended [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring is essential to detect adverse effects and ensure adherence. Monitor for **orthostatic hypotension** at each visit, and assess renal function and electrolytes regularly. Evaluate frailty and cognitive status periodically, and adjust therapy based on tolerance, adverse effects, and patient preferences [^11354SU4] [^114EJM8P] [^112t2sif].

---

## Special considerations

- **Frailty**: Use more lenient targets and individualized approaches [^112t2sif].
- **Polypharmacy**: Simplify regimens, consider deprescribing if adverse effects occur [^11354SU4].
- **Cognitive impairment**: Individualize targets and monitor closely for adverse effects [^114dN73y].

---

## Evidence from recent clinical trials

Recent trials support **intensive BP lowering** in older adults:

- **SPRINT**: Intensive SBP target < 120 mmHg reduced cardiovascular events and mortality in adults ≥ 75 years [^114uhsuM].
- **STEP**: Intensive SBP target 110–130 mmHg reduced cardiovascular events in adults 60–80 years [^117W7gzp].
- **HYVET**: SBP target < 150 mmHg reduced stroke and cardiovascular events in adults ≥ 80 years [^1173Daym].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Targets**: 130–139 mmHg for most ≥ 65 years; < 140/90 mmHg for ≥ 85 years or frail patients.
- **Initiation**: ≥ 150 mmHg for ≥ 60 years; consider ≥ 140 mmHg for high-risk patients.
- **Agents**: CCBs, ACEis/ARBs, thiazide-like diuretics; combination therapy often needed.
- **Lifestyle**: Emphasize sodium restriction, weight loss, exercise, alcohol moderation, smoking cessation.
- **Monitoring**: Regular orthostatic vitals, renal function, electrolytes, frailty, and cognitive status assessments.

---

Effective hypertension management in older adults requires **individualized targets**, careful selection and titration of medications, and regular monitoring to balance cardiovascular benefit with safety and quality of life [^116RZYXB].

JNC 8 Recommendation 1

In the general population aged ≥ 60 years, initiate pharmacologic treatment to lower BP at systolic BP (SBP) ≥ 150 mm Hg or diastolic BP (DBP) ≥ 90 mm Hg and treat to a goal SBP < 150 mm Hg and goal DBP < 90 mm Hg.

Basis of Recommendation

This first recommendation is based on several RCTs evaluating treatment of SBP to < 140 mm Hg versus a more liberal target (140–160 mm Hg) in patients > 65 years of age. 9, 10 In the Japanese Trial to Assess Optimal Systolic Blood Pressure in Elderly Hypertensive Patients (JATOS), 4418 patients between the ages of 65 and 85 were randomized to SBP treatment goal < 140 mm Hg versus 140 to < 160 mm Hg. Despite the fact that the intensive treatment group achieved a significantly lower BP (136/75 mm Hg versus 146/78 mm Hg), the primary end point of combined CVD and renal failure did not differ significantly between the 2 groups.

One limitation of this trial, however, is that it was only powered to detect a 40% relative risk reduction (or an absolute risk reduction from 5% to 3%) in the primary end point. While a 10/3–mm Hg reduction in BP is substantial, it may not be sufficient to achieve a 40% reduction in CVD or renal failure. Also, these patients were followed for only 2 years and the main treatment drug was a long‐acting calcium channel blocker (CCB). Diuretics, widely considered first line along with CCBs in most professional society guidelines, were used in only 12% of the patients. 7, 11, 12, 13 While not reaching statistical significance, subgroup analysis suggested that intensive treatment goals may be beneficial in patients < 75 years old while adopting a more liberal strategy may be safer in those ≥ 75 years old. 10

Current guidelines on BP-lowering goals

Current hypertension guidelines have recommended the appropriate BP-lowering strategy to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in older patients. The target is 130–139 mmHg in the European guideline and < 130 mmHg in the American College of Cardiology-American Heart Association guideline.

The major features and themes of the Asian guidelines are similar to European and US guidelines, but there are several subtle differences. For example, the 2018 Chinese Hypertension Guideline recommended that SBP should be targeted to < 150 mmHg, and further < 140 mmHg, if tolerated; in elderly patients aged over 80 years old, a SBP target of < 150 mmHg is recommended. The Japanese Society of Hypertension Guidelines for the Management of Hypertension (JSH 2019) recommends that the office BP goals for most hypertensive adults with comorbidities are at < 130/80 mmHg, and for the patients over 75 years old, the optimal office BP target is < 140/90 mmHg, if tolerated. In the 2018 Korean Society of Hypertension Guidelines for the Management of Hypertension, a target BP of < 130/80 mmHg is recommended for high-risk patients with 10-year CVD risk of > 15% or for patients with cardioasular disease over 50 years old, and in contrast, a target BP of < 140/90 mmHg is recommended for hypertensive patients at low-to-moderate risk.

### Twelve hot questions in the management of hypertension in patients aged 80 + years and their answers with the help of the 2023 European Society of Hypertension guidelines [^111URCfb]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Arterial hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and highly prevalent in older age, underscoring the importance of its appropriate management. The population is ageing at an increasing rate, with those aged 80+ years being the fastest growing population characterized by high heterogeneity in terms of functionality and autonomy. The prevalence of hypertension rises with increasing age, due to a significant increase in SBP largely as a result of age-related stiffening of the aorta and other large arteries, affecting almost 80% of those aged 80+ years. Appropriate management of blood pressure in this population is a priority for clinicians. Frailty is a condition characterized by marked vulnerability to adverse health outcomes and is common among older adults including those with hypertension. Hypertension increases frailty level and at the same time, individuals with increasing frailty present with more drug-related adverse effects meaning they are less tolerant to blood pressure lowering by medication. Thus, frailty is a factor that should be integrated when treating hypertension in this population. The European Society of Hypertension 2023 Guidelines on the management of Hypertension are the first international guidelines to integrate the concept of adapting blood pressure management in older adults according to their frailty/functionality level, and to propose practical tools for the application of this concept in the daily practice of physicians and other healthcare professionals. The present article prepared by the European Society of Hypertension Working Group on Hypertension in Older Adults aims to further address some important aspects mentioned concisely in the 2023 European Society of Hypertension guidelines, in order to help physicians and other healthcare professionals including those practicing in primary care. To this end, this study discusses 12 'hot questions' which are answered with the help of the 2023 European Society of Hypertension Guidelines. We hope the present article and Working Group's actions will contribute to understanding and applying the ideal management of hypertension in this most vulnerable population.

Conclusions

The majority of younger adults and older adults diagnosed with hypertension and recommended additional antihypertensive treatment by the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline would not have been eligible from the clinical trials underlying more intensive BP treatment thresholds. Clinical trials studying the outcomes of intensive BP treatment in younger adults at low cardiovascular risk and in older adults with multimorbidity are urgently needed, and, until these data are available, a patient‐centered approach that tailors treatments and targets by degree of BP elevation, comorbidity, and likelihood of benefit is likely preferable to universal adoption of intensive treatment targets.

Introduction

Hypertension affects ≈29% of the US adult population, an estimated 72 million people, with a prevalence of > 65% in persons older than 60 years. 1, 2 It is an important risk factor for myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), stroke, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), accounting for ≈41% of all CVD deaths. 3, 4 Indeed, there is a known graded relationship between increasing blood pressure (BP) and the risk of CVD, starting at 115/75 mm Hg. 5 Based on observational data, an increase in BP of 20 mm Hg systolic or 10 mm Hg diastolic is associated with a doubling of the risk of CVD death, regardless of age. 5 Further, hypertension in middle age is known to increase the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dementia in later life, an important issue given the aging demographic in Western societies. 6 Finally, despite the fact that BP recognition and control are improving, it is concerning that nearly half of the hypertensive population remains suboptimally controlled. 2

With the 2003 Joint National Committee's seventh report (JNC 7) becoming increasingly outdated and the 2011 Institute of Medicine report calling for high‐quality evidence‐based guidelines, 7, 8 the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) was initially appointed to create an updated treatment guideline for hypertension under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Although the NIH ultimately withdrew from the guideline development process at a late stage in the development of JNC 8, the panel decided, nonetheless, to publish their recommendations independently.

The panel aimed to answer 3 questions: Does initiating antihypertensive treatment at specific BP thresholds improve health outcomes? Does treatment with antihypertensive therapy to a specific BP goal improve health outcomes? Are there differences in benefit/harm between antihypertensive drugs or drug classes on specific health outcomes? The committee focused exclusively on large, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as supporting evidence, although 5 of the 9 recommendations in the final report were ultimately based on expert opinion. Partly in response to JNC 8, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) are now in the process of developing official hypertension guidelines. In this review, we discuss the basis of each recommendation from the JNC 8 panel, provide additional insights, and compare these recommendations with guidelines from other professional societies to generate suggestions for the new AHA/ACC hypertension guideline committee.

### Management of hypertension in the elderly [^112JWsw7]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is the most-prevalent modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality worldwide. Hypertension is highly prevalent among older adults (≥ 65 years), and aging of the population will substantially increase the prevalence of this condition. Age-related endothelial dysfunction and increased arterial stiffness contribute to the increased prevalence of hypertension, particularly systolic hypertension, among the elderly. The incidence of some forms of secondary hypertension also increases with age, mainly owing to the use of drugs (especially NSAIDs that have pressor effects) and the presence of chronic kidney disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and renal artery stenosis. Guidelines differ in thresholds and goals for antihypertensive drug therapy in the elderly because of a paucity of high-level evidence from randomized controlled trials and inconsistencies in the definition of 'elderly'. Medical treatment of hypertension reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the elderly, and all guidelines recommend lifestyle modifications and medical treatment for elderly patients whose blood pressure exceeds prescribed thresholds and who are at moderate or high cardiovascular disease risk. In the absence of comorbidities, which constitute 'compelling indications' for the use of specific antihypertensive drugs or drug classes, no clear evidence exists to support recommendations for the use of particular antihypertensive-drug classes in older adults.

The guideline, Treatment of Hypertension in Adults Over Age 60 to Higher vs. Lower Targets, was developed by the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Family Physicians. The AAFP continues its endorsement of the JNC8 guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults. These recommendations are consistent with JNC8 and should be used to augment its guidance.

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^115z4TP1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

JNC 8 Recommendations 2 to 5

In all persons < 60 years or in persons > 18 years (and either those younger or older than 60 years with either diabetes or CKD), initiate pharmacologic treatment to lower SBP ≥ 140 or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg and treat to a goal BP of < 140/90 mm Hg.

Basis of Recommendation

There is broader agreement between the professional societies on how to treat younger patients with hypertension. While most studies examined adults > 30 years, JNC 8 extends the same target to those aged 18 to 30 years. More support can be found for DBP versus SBP goals among younger adults with hypertension, especially in the Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) trial. 34 This trial randomized 18 790 hypertensive patients (aged 50 to 80 years) with baseline DBP 100 to 115 mm Hg into 3 groups based on target DBP ≤ 90, ≤ 85, or ≤ 80 mm Hg.

The main goal of this study was to assess the association between these 3 target DBPs and major CVD events (nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, and cardiovascular death). There was little difference in event rates between the 3 groups, except that the rate of MI was reduced in the 2 lower DBP target groups compared with the DBP ≤ 90 mm Hg group. Further subgroup analyses of patients with diabetes demonstrated fewer major CVD events, fewer strokes, and reduced cardiovascular mortality in the lowest BP treatment target group, while those with prior CVD had a significant reduction in stroke across the 3 groups. 34

While all 3 groups in HOT achieved a mean DBP < 90 mm Hg, the lowest risk of cardiovascular mortality was seen at 85.6 mm Hg and the lowest rate of CVD events was seen at 82.6 mm Hg. Based on this trial, everyone with hypertension under the JNC 8 guidelines has a DBP goal of < 90 mm Hg. There is less evidence supporting an SBP target of < 140 mm Hg in this group of patients. However, in trials like HOT, even though DBP was being targeted, SBP also fell at least 25 mm Hg in all 3 groups. 34 Indeed, given SPRINT suggests clinical benefit for an SBP target of 120 mm Hg among higher risk persons < 60 years, it is likely that forthcoming guidelines may even reduce this SBP target to a threshold lower than 140. However, the DBP values in the intensive therapy arm of SPRINT are not currently known.

### Guideline-driven management of hypertension: an evidence-based update [^114ugJqL]. Circulation Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Several important findings bearing on the prevention, detection, and management of hypertension have been reported since publication of the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Blood Pressure Guideline. This review summarizes and places in context the results of relevant observational studies, randomized clinical trials, and meta-analyses published between January 2018 and March 2021. Topics covered include blood pressure measurement, patient evaluation for secondary hypertension, cardiovascular disease risk assessment and blood pressure threshold for drug therapy, lifestyle and pharmacological management, treatment target blood pressure goal, management of hypertension in older adults, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, resistant hypertension, and optimization of care using patient, provider, and health system approaches. Presenting new information in each of these areas has the potential to increase hypertension awareness, treatment, and control which remain essential for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and mortality in the future.

### STEP to blood pressure management of elderly hypertension: evidence from Asia [^117W7gzp]. Hypertension Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is a global public health burden and a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and in Asia, but it remains inadequately controlled. Several large-scale epidemiological surveys in China have showed a high prevalence of hypertension ranging from 23.2 to 44.7% whereas the low control rate from 5.6 to 15%. The prevalence of hypertension is similarly high in other Asian countries, for example, 30% in the Republic of Korea and 47% in Mongolia. More than 50% in older people over 60 years of age has hypertension. With a rapidly aging population, hypertension management among the elderly has been increasing discussed.

Systolic blood pressure (SBP) is well-recognized to be more important than diastolic blood pressure (DBP) as an independent risk predictor for cardiovascular diseases. The appropriate target for SBP to reduce cardiovascular risk in older patients with hypertension remains debated. Impressive cardiovascular benefits have been observed with intensive BP control (SBP target, < 120 mmHg), as compared with standard BP control (SBP target, < 140 mmHg), in the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial), even in patients 75 years of age or older. A most recent meta-analysis including 51 randomized trials with over 350,000 participants from the BPLTTC (The Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists' Collaboration) showed that BP lowering is effective in older people for reducing major cardiovascular events, down to below 120/70 mmHg. The STEP (Strategy of Blood Pressure Intervention in the Elderly Hypertensive Patients) study — a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial conducted in China, provided new direct evidence that intensive BP treatment (SBP target, 110 mmHg to < 130 mmHg) benefits older hypertensive patients (aged 60–80 years) and reduces the incidence of cardiovascular events than standard treatment (target 130 mmHg to < 150 mmHg). Here we review the current status of BP control in elderly hypertension, focusing on the evidence from Asia, and also discuss the challenges of managing hypertension.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^115CjvEw]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Hypertension is the most common condition seen in primary care and leads to myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, and death if not detected early and treated appropriately. Patients want to be assured that blood pressure (BP) treatment will reduce their disease burden, while clinicians want guidance on hypertension management using the best scientific evidence. This report takes a rigorous, evidence-based approach to recommend treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults. Evidence was drawn from randomized controlled trials, which represent the gold standard for determining efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence quality and recommendations were graded based on their effect on important outcomes. There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg; however, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg for those groups based on expert opinion. The same thresholds and goals are recommended for hypertensive adults with diabetes or nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) as for the general hypertensive population younger than 60 years. There is moderate evidence to support initiating drug treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, or thiazide-type diuretic in the nonblack hypertensive population, including those with diabetes. In the black hypertensive population, including those with diabetes, a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-type diuretic is recommended as initial therapy. There is moderate evidence to support initial or add-on antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in persons with CKD to improve kidney outcomes. Although this guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the management of high BP and should meet the clinical needs of most patients, these recommendations are not a substitute for clinical judgment, and decisions about care must carefully consider and incorporate the clinical characteristics and circumstances of each individual patient.

### Prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure in adults: synopsis of the 2017 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association hypertension guideline [^116VRena]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Description

In November 2017, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) released a clinical practice guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure (BP) in adults. This article summarizes the major recommendations.

Methods

In 2014, the ACC and the AHA appointed a multidisciplinary committee to update previous reports of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure. The committee reviewed literature and commissioned systematic reviews and meta-analyses on out-of-office BP monitoring, the optimal target for BP lowering, the comparative benefits and harms of different classes of antihypertensive agents, and the comparative benefits and harms of initiating therapy with a single antihypertensive agent or a combination of 2 agents.

Recommendations

This article summarizes key recommendations in the following areas: BP classification, BP measurement, screening for secondary hypertension, nonpharmacologic therapy, BP thresholds and cardiac risk estimation to guide drug treatment, treatment goals (general and for patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and advanced age), choice of initial drug therapy, resistant hypertension, and strategies to improve hypertension control.

### Management of hypertension in the very old: an intensive reduction of blood pressure should be achieved in most patients [^111GYnHu]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

There is large evidence that treatment of hypertension significantly reduces the risk of morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Although it is generally accepted that the benefit of antihypertensive treatment is largely explained by the reduction in systolic blood pressure, the optimal blood pressure target in elderly patients is still a topic of debate. Unfortunately, the clinical trials which demonstrated the benefit of antihypertensive treatment in old and very old patients with hypertension included relatively fit patients since frail patients were generally excluded. Available data suggest that when treating older adults, and especially frail older hypertensive adults, extra caution is appropriate in the setting of significant adverse events. Nonetheless, recent observations demonstrated a similar benefit from a more intensive compared with a less intensive blood pressure lowering in both fit and frail older adults. Of note, the rate of serious adverse events appears not dissimilar in the two treatment strategies, and not associated to frailty. Taken together, these findings support the concept that an intensive therapeutic strategy appears reasonable even in elderly hypertensive patients, particularly when the treatment is well tolerated.

### 2014 hypertension recommendations from the eighth Joint National Committee panel members raise concerns for elderly black and female populations [^111df3yT]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

A report from panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee titled "2014 Evidence-Based Guideline for the Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults" has garnered much attention due to its major change in recommendations for hypertension treatment for patients ≥ 60 years of age and for their treatment goal. In response, certain groups have opposed the decision to initiate pharmacologic treatment to lower blood pressure (BP) at systolic BP ≥ 150 mm Hg and treat to a goal systolic BP of < 150 mm Hg in the general population age ≥ 60 years. This paper contains 3 sections-an introduction followed by the opinions of 2 writing groups-outlining objections to or support of maintaining this proposed strategy in certain at-risk populations, namely African Americans, women, and the elderly. Several authors argue for maintaining current targets, as opposed to adopting the new recommendations, to allow for optimal treatment for older women and African Americans, helping to close sex and race/ethnicity gaps in cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality.

### Pulmonary arterial hypertension with cardiopulmonary comorbidities: is it a unique phenotype? [^115gxuxT]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a subtype of pulmonary hypertension (PH), characterized by pulmonary arteries remodeling, which may ultimately contribute to right heart failure or even death. The epidemiological characteristics of PAH patients have changed over the years, in which there were more elder patients than young patients. Senior PAH patients have more comorbidities, worse functional and exercise capacity, mild hemodynamic impairment, and worse survival than young PAH patients.

Because of the similar clinical characteristics and the lack of evidence-based rule for the definition of PAH patients with cardiopulmonary comorbidities, the distinction between PAH and Group 2 or Group 3 PH is challenging. It also brings difficulties in diagnosis, treatment, and management for clinicians. The relationship between the category or numbers of comorbidities and functional classification, exercise capacity and mortality are still under debate.

Guidelines and researches also proposed a novel pattern of PAH treatment algorithm for PAH patients combined with comorbidities, suggesting that initial monotherapy would be appropriate. Because the management of comorbidities should be balanced, the treatment for PAH patients with comorbidities is challenging. Nevertheless, most of the randomized controlled drug trials failed to include elderly patients with multiple comorbidities. Evidence has revealed that patients with comorbidities present a worse therapeutic response, while the cause is unknown yet. Further investigation is required to evaluate the therapeutic impact of PAH-targeted therapies in PAH patients with comorbidities.

We hypothesized in our study that PAH patients with cardiopulmonary comorbidities are a separate subgroup of PAH. To gain further insights, we retrospectively investigated the clinical characteristics of PAH patients. The primary goal of this investigation was to compare the clinical data, PAH-targeted strategy, and therapeutic responses between PAH patients with and without comorbidities. The secondary objective was to explore whether the presence of comorbidities impact the clinical outcomes in PAH patients with comorbidities or not.

### STEP to blood pressure management of elderly hypertension: evidence from Asia [^112AjyiP]. Hypertension Research (2022). Medium credibility.

With a rapidly aging population, adequate blood pressure (BP) control is critical for hypertension management and prevention of cardiovascular events. Impressive cardiovascular benefits have been observed with intensive BP control (SBP target, < 120 mmHg) in the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) study, even in patients 75 years of age or older. A most recent meta-analysis including 51 randomized trials with over 350,000 participants from the BPLTTC (The Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists' Collaboration) showed that BP lowering is effective in older people for reducing major cardiovascular events. The STEP (Strategy of Blood Pressure Intervention in the Elderly Hypertensive Patients) study — a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial conducted in China, provided important evidence that intensive BP treatment (SBP target, 110 mmHg to < 130 mmHg) benefits older hypertensive patients (aged 60–80 years) and reduced the incidence of cardiovascular events than standard treatment (target 130 mmHg to < 150 mmHg). Because Asian people have a higher burden of hypertension and stroke than Caucasian people, intensive BP treatment has more advantages in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events including stroke in Asian hypertensive patients than in Caucasian people. Home BP monitoring is helpful to facilitate hypertension management for older patients. It should also be noted that clinical decision-making should be on a patient basis, such as fragility, diabetes, stroke, and other comorbidities, with tailored BP targets. Here we review the important clinical trials of BP control in elderly hypertension, interpretate the main findings of STEP, and also discuss the perspectives of managing hypertension in Asia.

### Higher blood pressure targets for hypertension in older adults [^114EkVCh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

This is an update of the original Cochrane review, published in 2017. Eight out of 10 major antihypertensive trials in adults, 65 years of age or older, attempted to achieve a target systolic blood pressure (BP) of < 160 mmHg. Collectively, these trials demonstrated cardiovascular benefit for treatment, compared to no treatment, for older adults with BP > 160 mmHg. However, an even lower BP target of < 140 mmHg is commonly applied to all age groups. Yet the risk and benefit of antihypertensive therapy can be expected to vary across populations, and some observational evidence suggests that older adults who are frail might have better health outcomes with less aggressive BP lowering. Current clinical practice guidelines are inconsistent in target BP recommendations for older adults, with systolic BP targets ranging from < 130 mmHg to < 150 mmHg. The 2017 review did not find compelling evidence of a reduction in any of the primary outcomes, including all-cause mortality, stroke, or total serious cardiovascular adverse events, comparing a lower BP target to a higher BP target in older adults with hypertension. It is important to update this review to explore if new evidence exists to determine whether older adults might do just as well, better, or worse with less aggressive pharmacotherapy for hypertension.

Objectives

To assess the effects of a less aggressive blood pressure target (in the range of < 150 to 160/95 to 105 mmHg), compared to a conventional or more aggressive BP target (of < 140/90 mmHg or lower) in hypertensive adults, 65 years of age or older.

Search Methods

For this update, Cochrane Hypertension's Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to June 2024: Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, and Embase Ovid, and the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials. We also contacted authors of relevant papers requesting information on further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials of hypertensive older adults (≥ 65 years) that spanned at least one year, and reported the effect on mortality and morbidity of a higher or lower systolic or diastolic BP treatment target. Higher BP targets ranged from systolic BP < 150 to 160 mmHg or diastolic BP < 95 to 105 mmHg; lower BP targets were 140/90 mmHg or lower, measured in an ambulatory, home, or office setting.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened and selected trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and certainty of the evidence, and extracted data. We combined data for dichotomous outcomes using the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous outcomes, we used mean difference (MD). Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, stroke, institutionalisation, and serious cardio-renal vascular adverse events. Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular mortality, non-cardiovascular mortality, unplanned hospitalisation, each component of cardiovascular serious adverse events separately (including cerebrovascular disease, cardiac disease, vascular disease, and renal failure), total serious adverse events, total minor adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse effects, systolic BP achieved, and diastolic BP achieved.

Main Results

With the addition of one new trial, we included four trials in this updated review (16,732 older adults with a mean age of 70.3 years). Of these, one trial used a combined systolic and diastolic BP target and compared a higher target of < 150/90 mmHg to a lower target of < 140/90 mmHg, and two trials utilised a purely systolic BP target, and compared a systolic BP < 150 mmHg (1 trial) and a systolic BP < 160 mmHg (1 trial), to a systolic BP < 140 mmHg. The fourth and newest trial also utilised a systolic BP target, but also introduced a lower limit for systolic BP. It compared systolic BP in the target range of 130 to 150 mmHg to a lower target range of 110 to 130 mmHg. The evidence shows that treatment to the lower BP target over two to four years may result in little to no difference in all-cause mortality (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.37; 4 studies, 16,732 participants; low-certainty evidence), but the lower BP target does reduce stroke (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.67; 4 studies, 16,732 participants; high-certainty evidence), and likely reduces total serious cardiovascular adverse events (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.45; 4 studies, 16,732 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Adverse effects were not available from all trials, but the lower BP target likely does not increase withdrawals due to adverse effects (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.33; 3 studies, 16,008 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

When comparing a higher BP target, in the range of < 150 to 160/95 to 105 mmHg, to a lower BP target of 140/90 or lower, over two to four years of follow-up, there is high-certainty evidence that the lower BP target reduces stroke, and moderate-certainty evidence that the lower BP target likely reduces serious cardiovascular events. The effect on all-cause mortality is unclear (low-certainty evidence), and the lower BP target likely does not increase withdrawals due to adverse effects (moderate-certainty evidence). Although additional research is warranted in those who are 80 years of age and older, and those who are frail (in whom risks and benefits may differ), conventional BP targets may be appropriate for the majority of older adults.

Recommendations for managing blood pressure in older adults

Lifestyle modification should be encouraged and emphasized to prevent development and aid in BP management at every visit. Several trials (SHEP [Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program], HYET [Hypertension in Very Elderly Trial], STEP [Strategy of Blood Pressure Intervention in the Elderly Hypertensive Patients], SPRINT [Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial]) have studied hypertension management in older adults with targets as low as systolic BP < 120. Overall, these trials demonstrated benefit for CV events, mortality, and dementia. Yet results remain inconclusive among those with advanced multimorbidity, frailty, cognitive decline, or institutionalization as these individuals were not included in the trials. Nevertheless, the 2017 American College of Cardiology/AHA hypertension guidelines recommend a target systolic BP of < 130/80 mm Hg for most adults aged 65 years and older. On the other hand, the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension suggest a higher systolic BP goal of 130 to 139 mm Hg and diastolic BP of 70 to 79 mm Hg in adults between ages 65 and 80 years.

For patients with preserved functional status, BP targets in older adults should be similar to those in younger adults. For those who have significant cognitive and/or functional decline, frailty and limited life expectancy, a BP target of systolic BP 130 to 150 mm Hg may be reasonable if lower BP causes hypotension or other adverse reactions. The pharmacologic maxim of "start low, go slow, but get there" should be followed. Intensive BP lowering is most appropriate for older adults with high CV risk burden and life expectancy of 3 or more years as those with limited life expectancy may not live long enough to derive benefit, (Table 1).

There are multiple first-line agents for BP treatment: thiazide diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and calcium-channel blocker. Thiazides have the highest risk of adverse events such as falls, acute renal injury, and should be used with caution. Calcium channel blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blockers may be beneficial in frail older patients, with the latter having a role in increasing lower limb muscle mass. Alpha blockers, such as those commonly used for benign prostatic hyperplasia in men, and diuretics can induce or worsen orthostatic hypotension, increase risk of falls, and hip fracture. Other drugs to be used with caution are clonidine, methyldopa, nifedipine, and reserpine.

Among people age 60 and over with moderate to severe HTN, there is evidence that treating to an SBP goal of 150 mm Hg or less reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and among people 60 years and over, there was also evidence of further benefit in lowering systolic blood pressure to levels between 130 and 150 mm Hg.

### Targeting a systolic blood pressure of… [^11324dSk]. Hypertension Research (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, this updated meta-analysis provides strong evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of intensive BP control (SBP, < 130 mmHg) in patients with hypertension aged ≥ 75 years. Our findings argue against the use of higher BP targets in the absence of compelling contraindications, and support a more unified approach to BP management across age groups. Future guidelines should consider retiring arbitrary age thresholds in favor of individualized, risk-based decision making that acknowledges the growing heterogeneity of the older adult population. Further studies are warranted to define optimal BP targets in frail, institutionalized, or cognitively impaired individuals, who remain underrepresented in the existing evidence.

### Changing concepts in hypertension management [^111i4Bfn]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Hypertension is the most common modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and death, and lowering blood pressure with anti-hypertensive drugs reduces target organ damage and prevents cardiovascular disease outcomes. The recent trials SPRINT and HOPE-3 will lead to changes in the way we manage hypertension and impact on clinical practice guidelines. These studies also demonstrate the shift toward automated blood pressure measurements. We have reviewed these studies and others to put them in context with the guidelines that have come before and to describe how they will impact on hypertension treatment thresholds and targets, the treatment of hypertension in the elderly, and changing approaches to the management of hypertension including resistant hypertension.

### Hypertension in older adults: assessment, management, and challenges [^111eaQQZ]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypertension in older adults is related to adverse cardiovascular outcomes, such as heart failure, stroke, myocardial infarction, and death. The global burden of hypertension is increasing due to an aging population and increasing prevalence of obesity, and is estimated to affect one third of the world's population by 2025. Adverse outcomes in older adults are compounded by mechanical hemodynamic changes, arterial stiffness, neurohormonal and autonomic dysregulation, and declining renal function. This review highlights the current evidence and summarizes recent guidelines on hypertension, pertaining to older adults. Management strategies for hypertension in older adults must consider the degree of frailty, increasingly complex medical comorbidities, and psycho-social factors, and must therefore be individualized. Non-pharmacological lifestyle interventions should be encouraged to mitigate the risk of developing hypertension, and as an adjunctive therapy to reduce the need for medications. Pharmacological therapy with diuretics, renin-angiotensin system blockers, and calcium channel blockers have all shown benefit on cardiovascular outcomes in older patients. Given the economic and public health burden of hypertension in the United States and globally, it is critical to address lifestyle modifications in younger generations to prevent hypertension with age.

### Do we AGREE on the targets of antihypertensive drug treatment in older adults: a systematic review of guidelines on primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases [^114crCvZ]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertension is the worldwide leading predisposing condition for disease burden, and as the most important modifiable risk factor, its management forms an essential pillar of primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Globally, hypertension is prevalent in roughly one in four adults and steadily rises with age. For example, data from the Framingham Heart Study showed that more than 90% of the normotensive participants between 55 and 65 years developed hypertension, emphasizing the need for a thoughtful treatment strategy. Nevertheless, an international analysis of health surveys estimated that the proportion of hypertensive adults between 35 and 85 years receiving antihypertensive drug therapy ranges from 29.0% to 80.5%.

Only during the last three decades randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have demonstrated that pharmacological treatment of hypertension in older adults is beneficial. Although those studies included octogenarians, frail older adults are largely underrepresented as many of them are excluded from trials due to their comorbidities. To date, no interventional studies specific to antihypertensive treatment in older frail individuals have been conducted. Several population-based cohort studies, in contrast, have shown that low blood pressure (BP) under antihypertensive drug treatment, especially in older adults with frailty or other complex health problems, is associated with higher all-cause mortality rates. Despite the high quality of the available evidence, translation into clinical guidance for the heterogeneous population of older adults is challenging.

In the current discussion on hypertension management in older adults, the clinical problem is not only when to start, but predominantly how low the target BP needs to be. This intensity and thereby numerical target of antihypertensive drug therapy is set on the balance between cardiovascular risk reduction and chance of side effects. Recent trial evidence favours intensive treatment for most patients; however, frail older adults seem to be at higher risk for both cardiovascular events and severe side effects of antihypertensive drug therapy, resulting in an unclear net benefit.

Because translation of the available evidence concerning primary cardiovascular prevention into clinical guidance for older adults is challenging, insight into the actual guidelines about hypertension management will contribute to the present debate. Therefore, the primary aim of this review was to provide a systematic, cross-continental and present-day overview of the thresholds and targets of antihypertensive drug treatment in older adults recommended in the currently used guidelines. A secondary aim was to explore the potential relationships between the advised targets and guideline characteristics, including methodological quality, continent of origin, intended users and the guideline committee's selection of evidence supporting the recommended targets.

### Variation in hypertension clinical practice guidelines: a global comparison [^113f1nZY]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Currently, there are many local, national and international guidelines produced by different organisations that give recommendations for the management of hypertension. Studies comparing these guidelines have shown variation in recommendations for the diagnosis, treatment and treatment targets for patients with hypertension. However, these studies compared a small number of guidelines, mainly from HICs and offered only a brief insight into their similarities and differences. Hence, scope exists to compare hypertension guidelines on a far larger scale and, importantly, across income settings.

As a condition for which the affected population predominantly live in LMICs, knowledge of variation in recommendations made to clinicians treating patients with hypertension in these settings remains poorly understood. This study aims to address this deficiency by examining the extent of variation across clinical practice guidelines for the management of hypertension internationally. The primary aim is to determine whether variation exists between CPGs for the management of hypertension through analysis of national and international guidelines from different income settings. Specifically, this study aims to compare the following:
Diagnostic thresholds for hypertension and staging of hypertension
Recommended treatment strategies for uncomplicated primary hypertension (in the absence of comorbidities)
Target BP for patients with uncomplicated primary hypertension
Whether different targets are recommended for the elderly and other at-risk subpopulations

### JNC 8 guidelines for the management of hypertension in… [^113PQ4sc]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- In the general population, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg or higher in adults 60 years and older, or 140/90 mm Hg or higher in adults younger than 60 years.
- In patients with hypertension and diabetes, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg or higher, regardless of age. From the AFP Editors Hypertension is one of the most important preventable contributors to disease and death in the United States, leading to myocardial infarction, stroke, and renal failure when it is not detected early and treated appropriately. The Eighth Joint National Committee recently released evidence-based recommendations on treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults.

In the general population of adults 60 years and older, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when the systolic pressure is 150 mm Hg or higher, or when the diastolic pressure is 90 mm Hg or higher. Patients should be treated to a target systolic pressure of less than 150 mm Hg and a target diastolic pressure of less than 90 mm Hg. Treatment does not need to be adjusted if it results in a systolic pressure lower than 140 mm Hg, as long as it is not associated with adverse effects on health or quality of life. In the general population younger than 60 years, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when the systolic pressure is 140 mm Hg or higher, or when the diastolic pressure is 90 mm Hg or higher. The target systolic pressure in this population is less than 140 mm Hg, and the target diastolic pressure is less than 90 mm Hg.

Hypertension in Patients with CKD or Diabetes For persons 18 years or older with chronic kidney disease or diabetes mellitus, the treatment threshold and target blood pressures are the same as those for the general population younger than 60 years.

### STEP to blood pressure management of elderly hypertension: evidence from Asia [^111YR6HE]. Hypertension Research (2022). Medium credibility.

With a rapidly aging population, adequate blood pressure (BP) control is critical for hypertension management and prevention of cardiovascular events. Impressive cardiovascular benefits have been observed with intensive BP control (SBP target, < 120mmHg) in the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) study, even in patients 75 years of age or older. A most recent meta-analysis including 51 randomized trials with over 350,000 participants from the BPLTTC (The Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists' Collaboration) showed that BP lowering is effective in older people for reducing major cardiovascular events. The STEP (Strategy of Blood Pressure Intervention in the Elderly Hypertensive Patients) study-a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial conducted in China, provided important evidence that intensive BP treatment (SBP target, 110mmHg to < 130mmHg) benefits older hypertensive patients (aged 60–80 years) and reduced the incidence of cardiovascular events than standard treatment (target 130mmHg to < 150mmHg). Because Asian people have a higher burden of hypertension and stroke than Caucasian people, intensive BP treatment has more advantages in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events including stroke in Asian hypertensive patients than in Caucasian people. Home BP monitoring is helpful to facilitate hypertension management for older patients. It should also be noted that clinical decision-making should be on a patient basis, such as fragility, diabetes, stroke, and other comorbidities, with tailored BP targets. Here we review the important clinical trials of BP control in elderly hypertension, interpretate the main findings of STEP, and also discuss the perspectives of managing hypertension in Asia.

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines has now released the long-awaited 2025 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/AANP/AAPA/ABC/ACCP/ACPM/AGS/AMA/ASPC/NMA/PCNA/SGIM Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults. Since the previous version, which had been in place for 8 years, meta-analyses and several treat-to-target trials investigating lower versus standard blood pressure targets have been published. Based on these, the 2025 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline recommends in adults with confirmed hypertension, an office blood pressure goal of < 130/80 mmHg, with encouragement to further reduce systolic blood pressure to < 120 mmHg. Here, we set out why we support these lower blood pressure targets and outline strategies to achieve them.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2017 ACC / AHA hypertension guideline [^112gDYYh]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and reduction of elevated blood pressure (BP) remains an important intervention for slowing kidney disease progression. Over the past decade, the most appropriate BP target for initiation and titration of BP-lowering medications has been an area of intense research and debate within the clinical community. In 2017, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) in conjunction with several other professional societies released new hypertension guidelines based on data from a systematic review of clinical trials and observational data. While many of the recommendations in the ACC/AHA hypertension guideline are relevant to nephrology practice, BP targets and management strategies for patients receiving dialysis are not discussed. This Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) commentary focuses largely on recommendations from the ACC/AHA hypertension guidelines that are pertinent to individuals at risk of chronic kidney disease or with non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease. This KDOQI commentary also includes a brief discussion of the consensus statement regarding hypertension diagnosis and management for adults receiving maintenance dialysis published by the European Renal and Cardiovascular Medicine Working Group of the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association (ERA-EDTA) and the Hypertension and the Kidney working group of the European Society of Hypertension. Overall, we support the vast majority of the ACC/AHA recommendations and highlight select areas in which best diagnosis and treatment options remain controversial.

### Hypertension in older adults: assessment, management, and challenges [^114TenET]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The 2018 ACC/AHA 1 and ESC/ESH guidelines 2 have different definitions for blood pressure goals: < 130/80 mmHg for ACC/AHA and < 140/90 mmHg for ESC/ESH. Additional differences arise when addressing the risk and goals in order people at 130/70 to 139/79 mmHg for ESC/ESH but < 130/80 mmHg for ACC/AHA. The newer lower thresholds have now included more patients as hypertensives.

HTN is known to have significant effects on cardiovascular (CVD) outcomes such as heart failure, myocardial infarction, and stroke. 3 The asymptomatic quality of systemic hypertension can delay diagnosis and prompt initiation of optimal therapies. As with many conditions, HTN increases with age, with its prevalence increasing from 27% in patients aged younger than 60 years to 74% in those aged older than 80 years. 4 The Framingham Heart Study 5 showed than more than 90% of the participants with a normal blood pressure (BP) at age 55 years eventually develop HTN. Approximately 60% of the population has HTN by 60 years of age and about 65% of men and 75% of women develop high BP by 70 years. 5 By the year 2060, the projected number of people living age 65 years or older will comprise 25% of the United States (US), of which nearly 20 million will surpass the eighth decade of life. Up to 50% of the people born in the US today will reach their 100th year. 6 With this rapidly aging population, the prevalence of HTN can only be expected to rise.

Interestingly, several studies that focused on guiding screening and management of HTN traditionally excluded older adults, particularly those over the age of 80 years. Treating elevated BP in older adults has, therefore, remained controversial. However, recent data demonstrates CVD benefits in treating HTN in older adults. This emanates from several key studies, including the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), 7 the Systolic HTN in the Elderly Program (SHEP), 8 SPRINT, 9 the Systolic HTN in Europe trial (Syst‐Eur), 10 Medical Research Council Working Party, 11 and the HTN in the Very Elderly Trial (HYVET). 12 Thus, recognition and appropriate treatment of HTN in older adults should be a priority for physicians. This review article aims to address the challenges in assessment and management of HTN in older adults, as well to address the differences among guidelines and societies.

### Rationalizing the treatment of hypertension [^117CLCoV]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Management of hypertension in this country is confounded by continual changes in recommended target blood pressure (BP) goals and a nonhomogeneous patient population who have a variety of demographic and clinical characteristics that influence treatment. This paper focuses on three major elements in managing hypertension: BP and the importance of reducing it to acceptably low levels; concomitant risk factors or cardiovascular and renal target involvement; and drug therapy that may confer prognostic advantages beyond those predicted by BP effects.

### Variation in hypertension clinical practice guidelines: a global comparison [^1172u7if]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Many CPGs recommended different management strategies for elderly patients, with most opting for a higher BP target of < 150/90 mmHg. Higher targets may result from a trade-off between achieving adequate BP control and minimising adverse drug effects, which are more common in elderly patients. There was a significant variation in the definition of the term "elderly", ranging from age ≥ 55 to ≥ 80 years between CPGs. No clear correlation to income settings was seen between the age definitions chosen by guidelines. It may partly be attributed to variation in life expectancy across the countries from which CPGs were identified, and some CPGs explicitly mention their populations' life expectancy when determining the cut-off age. In addition to differing thresholds for the elderly, many guidelines also included specific thresholds for comorbidities, including diabetes, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. There was a general consensus towards lower target BPs in these groups (BP < 130/80 mmHg) which could reflect the need for more stringent BP control in these high-risk patients.

Other Limitations

There are several limitations to consider in the JNC 8 committee's approach to BP treatment (Table 2). Unlike the other professional societies' guidelines, the JNC 8 panel did not address topics outside of their chosen critical questions, specifically given the paucity of randomized trial evidence addressing such questions. While they endorsed the AHA/ACC Guideline on Lifestyle Management to Reduce Cardiovascular Risk, 50 the JNC 8 does not address lifestyle modifications or a timeline for attempting them. Another limitation is that ambulatory BP monitoring, including cut‐off values for diagnosing hypertension based on home BP readings, is not addressed.

Table 2
Recommendations for the AHA/ACC Committee

One suggestion is to confirm elevated BP with ambulatory BP monitoring, such as that recently recommended by the US Preventive Service Task Force. 51 There is in general a lack of guidance on the diagnosis of hypertension and the evaluation for secondary causes. Although the JNC 8 committee offers a titration schedule for treating hypertension, the recommendations are somewhat vague, and there is no guidance for resistant hypertension beyond referral to a hypertension specialist.

We also recommend that the AHA/ACC guideline committee focus on the benefits of the various drug classes and the situations that call for monodrug versus multidrug therapy. Another important area of focus will be the benefit of more‐intensive BP treatment, especially in the elderly and those with diabetes, and the addition of a risk‐based approach to initiating treatment (described earlier). These are all areas that can be targeted by the new AHA/ACC guideline committee.

Office BP Treatment Targets

Both the ACC/AHA and ESC/ESH recommend lower BP treatment targets compared with the goals advised in previous guidelines. The ACC/AHA recommends SBP/DBP < 130/80 mm Hg as a general treatment target, if tolerated (Tables 6–8). For older adults (≥ 65 years), who are noninstitutionalized, ambulatory, and community dwelling, the target is SBP < 130 mm Hg, if tolerated. For older adults with a high burden of comorbidity and limited life expectancy, treatment decisions should be based on clinical judgment, patient preference, and a team-based assessment of risk/benefit. The ESC/ESH recommends target ranges but recognizes that the optimal and tolerated targets for individuals will differ. The initial SBP/DBP target is < 140/90 mm Hg for all adults with hypertension. Provided the treatment is well tolerated, targeting to 130/80 mm Hg is recommended, with subsequent efforts to achieve a lower BP in those 18 to 65 years of age. An exception to the general rule is that the SBP target in adults with hypertension and CKD should be < 140 to 130 mm Hg. The ESC/ESH advises against specifically targeting SBP to < 120 mm Hg for adults, but acknowledges that this may be achieved in some treated patients without adverse effects. A key emphasis, especially in older and frailer patients, is to tailor the treatment to achieve the best BP possible within the target range, while monitoring for adverse effects. The optimal DBP target is defined as 70 to 79 mm Hg for all patients, but the emphasis is on controlling SBP, even when DBP is below these levels, provided the treatment is tolerated.

The guideline specifies a target range because the lower safety boundary assumes greater importance when BP is targeted to lower levels, and when SBP is lowered to < 120 mmHg in patients included in randomized controlled trials (older and higher-risk patients with comorbidities and cardiovascular disease), the risk of harm appears to increase and outweigh the benefits.

### Is 60 the new 80 in hypertension? [^114use8x]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Since the release of the "2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8)", much controversy has ensued over the appropriate systolic blood pressure goal for those over the age of 60 years. This guideline suggested liberalizing the target for this population to < 150 mmHg, moving away from previous guidelines suggesting a target of < 140 mmHg. While some national quality measures have accepted the new relaxed blood pressure goal, the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology have not. Recently published data show that millions of adults over 60 years of age would be classified as controlled using a threshold of < 150 mmHg, but not with a target of < 140 mmHg. In addition, emerging randomized trial evidence suggests that targeting a systolic blood pressure well below 140 mmHg is beneficial in older adults. In light of the improved health and vitality of older adults, and the steady decline in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular mortality over recent decades, we do not think it is in good judgment to liberalize the treatment target in adults less than 80 years of age.

Abstract

Hypertension in older adults is related to adverse cardiovascular outcomes, such as heart failure, stroke, myocardial infarction, and death. The global burden of hypertension is increasing due to an aging population and increasing prevalence of obesity, and is estimated to affect one third of the world's population by 2025. Adverse outcomes in older adults are compounded by mechanical hemodynamic changes, arterial stiffness, neurohormonal and autonomic dysregulation, and declining renal function. This review highlights the current evidence and summarizes recent guidelines on hypertension, pertaining to older adults. Management strategies for hypertension in older adults must consider the degree of frailty, increasingly complex medical comorbidities, and psycho‐social factors, and must therefore be individualized. Non‐pharmacological lifestyle interventions should be encouraged to mitigate the risk of developing hypertension, and as an adjunctive therapy to reduce the need for medications. Pharmacological therapy with diuretics, renin‐angiotensin system blockers, and calcium channel blockers have all shown benefit on cardiovascular outcomes in older patients. Given the economic and public health burden of hypertension in the United States and globally, it is critical to address lifestyle modifications in younger generations to prevent hypertension with age.

### Management of hypertension in older persons [^111dvKAv]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Antihypertensive therapy has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in older patients with elevated systolic or diastolic blood pressures. This benefit appears to persist in patients older than 80 years, but less than one third of older patients have adequate blood pressure control. Systolic blood pressure is the most important predictor of cardiovascular disease. Blood pressure measurement in older persons should include an evaluation for orthostatic hypotension. Low-dose thiazide diuretics remain first-line therapy for older patients. Beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers are second-line medications that should be selected based on comorbidities and risk factors.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^11626Cow]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — older adults with grade 1 hypertension: For the purposes of this guideline, the 'old' are defined as ≥ 65 years and the 'very old' as ≥ 80 years, and prior evidence in older patients was obtained when baseline SBP was ≥ 160 mmHg with strong evidence that these patients should be offered BP-lowering drug treatment. The evidence supports the recommendation that older patients (> 65 years, including patients over 80 years) should be offered BP-lowering treatment if their SBP is ≥ 160 mmHg, and there is also justification to now recommend BP-lowering treatment for old patients (aged ≥ 65 but not > 80 years) at a lower BP (i.e.g.rade 1 hypertension: SBP = 140–159 mmHg). BP-lowering drugs should not be withdrawn on the basis of age alone, and in patients aged > 80 years, CV risk reduction was greatest in those who continued treatment rather than in those whose treatment was discontinued; as stated, these recommendations relate to relatively fit and independent older patients.

Principles for Algorithm Development

The following is a summary of principles recommended by the AHA, ACC, and CDC for creating an effective hypertension management algorithm:

Base algorithm components and processes on the best available science.
Format to be simple to update as better information becomes available.
Create feasible, simple implementation strategy.
Include patient version at appropriate scientific and language literacy level.
Consider costs of diagnosis, monitoring, treatment.
Develop algorithm in format easily used within a team approach to health care.
Develop algorithm in a format able to be incorporated into electronic health records for use as clinical decision support.
Include a disclaimer to ensure that the algorithm is not used to counter the treating healthcare provider's best clinical judgment.

The purpose of these principles is to establish a common platform for the development and implementation of hypertension management algorithms tailored to different practice settings and populations. We note the last principle supports the notion that treatment guidelines serve to facilitate a systematic approach to the management of hypertension, but provide appropriate modifications based on specific patient characteristics, preferences and other pragmatic factors (eg, cost, pill burden, risks of certain side effects) to optimize a personalized approach to the care of individual patients. In addition, ongoing randomized clinical trials (eg, SPRINT) are addressing optimal blood pressure targets for specific patient subgroups such as the elderly and patient with chronic kidney diseases to maximize net clinical benefit and avoid unnecessary complications.

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^11548Gcg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

While this approach still needs to be externally validated, we suggest that the new AHA/ACC guideline committee consider a risk‐based approach for adults > 60 years of age; initiating treatment for those with SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg if their 10‐year ASCVD risk score is > 7.5% based on the pooled cohort equations. 32 Persons with ASCVD risk < 7.5% appear less likely to benefit from this more‐aggressive BP target and may not require treatment until their SBP is ≥ 150 mm Hg. We note, however, that, given the substantial influence of age in the ASCVD risk calculator, the vast majority of men and many women > 60 years old who have an SBP of > 140 mm Hg would qualify for more‐aggressive BP treatment based on this 7.5% threshold. Thus, future research may identify a more‐optimal ASCVD risk cut‐point (perhaps, for example, > 15% [the risk cutoff for SPRINT]), below which a more lenient SBP goal of 150 mm Hg could be targeted in adults between 60 and 80 years old.

The 2014 National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence cardiovascular risk assessment guidelines suggest starting BP treatment in adults with a CVD risk score ≥ 10% based on the QRISK2 calculator. 33 It is worth noting that estimation of CVD risk is also now a critical part of the cholesterol treatment guidelines and, hence, could also be used to enhance the treatment of hypertension in high‐risk adults. Further research will be needed to explore the optimal ASCVD risk score to initiate BP treatment for men and women and to determine the potential role, if any, of cardiac biomarkers such as coronary artery calcium in guiding risk‐based allocation of hypertension therapy.

To reiterate, with CVD risk being heavily influenced by age, the absolute benefit of BP treatment for risk reduction is greatest in the elderly. However, despite the JNC 8 recommendations, none of the trials on which these recommendations are based were conducted in elderly hypertensive patients with an initial SBP between 140 and 150 mm Hg. Thus, it is not possible to be entirely sure what BP target to use without more evidence from RCTs, which is why the results from SPRINT will be critical for the new guideline committee.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^114EJM8P]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Hypertension in older patients (age ≥ 65 years) — older is defined as ≥ 65 years and the very old as ≥ 80 years — has high prevalence (~60% over the age of 60 years and ~75% over the age of 75 years). Evidence from randomized controlled trials indicates benefit and tolerability, as "antihypertensive treatment substantially reduces CV morbidity and CV- and all-cause mortality" and "treatment has been found to be generally well tolerated", and "age alone should never be a barrier to treatment". It is recommended that older patients are treated according to the guideline algorithm, and "in very old patients, it may be appropriate to initiate treatment with monotherapy". For targets, "BP should be lowered to a systolic value of 130–139 mmHg and a diastolic value of < 80 mmHg if tolerated", and "treated SBP values of < 130 mmHg should be avoided". Monitoring needs are emphasized: "in all older patients, and especially very old or frail patients, possible occurrence of postural BP should be closely monitored and symptoms of possible hypotensive episodes checked by ABPM", and "renal function should be frequently assessed to detect possible increases in serum creatinine and reductions in eGFR". Drug selection cautions are that "centrally acting drugs and alpha-blockers should be avoided because of their association with injurious falls". Adverse effects require vigilance because "adverse effects can be more frequent than reported in RCTs", and trial evidence is limited as "RCTs have not included very frail patients, dependent patients, and patients with postural hypotension".

### Treating hypertension in the very elderly [^11595RuS]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the evidence for strict blood pressure (BP) management in the very elderly, defined as patients aged 80 years and older.

Data Sources

A literature search was performed using PubMed (1950 through November 2010) for the MeSH terms hypertension and elderly; subterms of identified MeSH terms (ie, explosion) for the elderly were also searched. A broader search was conducted of PubMed articles published in the past 4 years. Searches were conducted for additional primary literature referenced in identified articles; an updated Cochrane Database review was also performed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All identified studies that specifically included very elderly patients and BP were reviewed.

Data Synthesis

The BP goal established in the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) is less than 140/90 mm Hg, regardless of age, unless a compelling indication exists. Although evidence suggests that lowering BP will lower the risk of stroke, lower BP in the very elderly may result in higher mortality. Many physicians are reluctant to treat BP in accordance with the JNC 7 goal in very elderly patients for a variety of reasons, including concerns about fall risk, lack of benefit in mortality reduction, and concerns about drug interactions and adverse effects. Results from a randomized controlled trial and meta-analysis have demonstrated reductions in stroke, heart failure, and cardiovascular events in the very elderly. The American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association recently published guidelines for elderly patients that suggest treating the very elderly carefully and with different BP goals than previously recommended.

Conclusions

Optimal management of hypertension in the very elderly remains a concern. Few studies have evaluated hypertension in this population, and studies that included patients over 80 enrolled too few to draw conclusions. Although the HYVET (Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial) study did have adequate power to evaluate the very elderly, because this study was stopped early because of significant findings in mortality, unanswered questions remain regarding optimal BP targets.

### Pharmacologic treatment of hypertension: ACP and AAFP release recommendations for adults 60 years and older… [^1121asvU]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- In persons older than 60 years with a persistent systolic BP level of 150 mm Hg or greater, treatment should be aimed at attaining a level of less than 150 mm Hg.
- Starting or increasing BP medications should be considered in older persons with a history of stroke or TIA to achieve a systolic BP of less than 140 mm Hg and reduce the risk of recurrent stroke. Hypertension is a common chronic condition occurring in almost 65% of persons older than 60 years. Proper treatment can lower the risk of cardiovascular, renal, and cerebrovascular disease, as well as mortality; however, there is debate regarding ideal blood pressure targets. Comorbid conditions should also be considered when choosing a BP target in persons 60 years and older.

The American College of Physicians and American Academy of Family Physicians have made recommendations for all clinicians to treat hypertension in this patient population, based on the benefits and harms of higher and lower systolic BP targets. Higher vs. Lower BP Targets BENEFITS Although trials have shown that treating high BP in older persons is beneficial, the evidence was based primarily on persons with moderate or severe hypertension initially who later reached levels greater than 140 mm Hg with treatment. Based on high-quality evidence, all-cause mortality, stroke, and cardiac events are reduced in persons with initial BP levels of at least 160 mm Hg who later attained BP levels lower than 150 mm Hg.

Recommendations To lower the risk of mortality, stroke, and cardiac events in persons with a persistent BP level of 150 mm Hg or greater, treatment should be aimed at attaining a level of less than 150 mm Hg. High-quality evidence showed a reduction in these events at this target, with most persons experiencing benefit, regardless of the presence of diabetes mellitus. Studies in which patients' baseline mean BP levels were higher than 160 mm Hg indicated the best and most consistent benefit. Because persons who are 60 years and older are often taking other medications, the burden of additional treatment and possible medication interactions should be assessed when making treatment decisions for hypertension. Generic medications should be prescribed whenever possible. When making treatment decisions, physicians should keep in mind that evidence in persons with frailty or comorbidities is limited.

### Epidemiology of hypertension among Bangladeshi adults using the 2017 ACC / AHA hypertension clinical practice guidelines and Joint National Committee 7 guidelines [^1163P7cK]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Globally, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) lead to one-third of all annual deaths, which is nearly 17 million total deaths worldwide. Of these deaths due to CVDs, complications of hypertension account for 53% of CVD-related mortality worldwide every year. Although highly preventable, hypertension is the most prevalent risk factor for CVD. The global prevalence of hypertension is projected to increase from 26% in 2000 to 29.2% by 2025. Factors attributed to the increase in prevalence of hypertension include, population growth, ageing of the population, and behavioral risk factors, such as smoking, poor diet, harmful use of alcohol, low physical activity, and overweight or obesity. Globally, the observed increasing burden of hypertension is a major public health concern.

In 2017, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) published updated guidelines titled, The ACC/AHA Guidelines for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults or the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines. These guidelines provide updated recommendations for the diagnostic criteria of hypertension, appropriate blood pressure (BP) criteria for pharmacologic intervention, BP target goals, diagnostic work and evaluation for hypertension, and lifestyle management strategies both for prevention and for treatment of hypertension. The 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines were developed based on evidence from recently published randomized control trials, and a broader range of evidence, such as epidemiological studies and expert opinion. However, of note, several scientific organizations, such as the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Family Physicians, have not endorsed the updated guidelines particularly its applicability to those aged 60 years and above. This may impact uptake of the updated diagnostic criteria of hypertension and recommendations for care and treatment, included in the 2017 ACC/AHA among physicians in the United States.

### Hypertension management in frail older adults: a gap in evidence [^111R1x5W]. Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Hypertension management is challenging in frail older adults. The balance between treatment risks and benefits may be difficult to achieve due to an increased vulnerability to treatment-related adverse events, and limited evidence is available to support clinical decisions. The effects of frailty on blood pressure are unclear, as well as its impact on antihypertensive treatment benefits. Appropriate blood pressure targets in frail patients are debated and the frailty measure which best inform clinical decisions in hypertensive patients has yet to be identified. Therefore, hypertension management in frail older adults still represents a 'gap in evidence'. Knowledge of currently available literature is a fundamental prerequisite to develop future research and may help to implement frailty assessment and improve hypertension management in this vulnerable population. Given these premises, we present a narrative review illustrating the most relevant issues that are a matter of debate and that should be addressed in future studies.

### Intensive vs standard blood pressure control and cardiovascular disease outcomes in adults aged ≥ 75 years: a randomized clinical trial [^114uhsuM]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The appropriate treatment target for systolic blood pressure (SBP) in older patients with hypertension remains uncertain.

Objective

To evaluate the effects of intensive (< 120 mm Hg) compared with standard (< 140 mm Hg) SBP targets in persons aged 75 years or older with hypertension but without diabetes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A multicenter, randomized clinical trial of patients aged 75 years or older who participated in the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT). Recruitment began on October 20, 2010, and follow-up ended on August 20, 2015.

Interventions

Participants were randomized to an SBP target of less than 120 mm Hg (intensive treatment group, n = 1317) or an SBP target of less than 140 mm Hg (standard treatment group, n = 1319).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary cardiovascular disease outcome was a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome not resulting in a myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, nonfatal acute decompensated heart failure, and death from cardiovascular causes. All-cause mortality was a secondary outcome.

Results

Among 2636 participants (mean age, 79.9 years; 37.9% women), 2510 (95.2%) provided complete follow-up data. At a median follow-up of 3.14 years, there was a significantly lower rate of the primary composite outcome (102 events in the intensive treatment group vs 148 events in the standard treatment group; hazard ratio [HR], 0.66 [95% CI, 0.51–0.85]) and all-cause mortality (73 deaths vs 107 deaths, respectively; HR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.49–0.91]). The overall rate of serious adverse events was not different between treatment groups (48.4% in the intensive treatment group vs 48.3% in the standard treatment group; HR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.89–1.11]). Absolute rates of hypotension were 2.4% in the intensive treatment group vs 1.4% in the standard treatment group (HR, 1.71 [95% CI, 0.97–3.09]), 3.0% vs 2.4%, respectively, for syncope (HR, 1.23 [95% CI, 0.76–2.00]), 4.0% vs 2.7% for electrolyte abnormalities (HR, 1.51 [95% CI, 0.99–2.33]), 5.5% vs 4.0% for acute kidney injury (HR, 1.41 [95% CI, 0.98–2.04]), and 4.9% vs 5.5% for injurious falls (HR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.65–1.29]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among ambulatory adults aged 75 years or older, treating to an SBP target of less than 120 mm Hg compared with an SBP target of less than 140 mm Hg resulted in significantly lower rates of fatal and nonfatal major cardiovascular events and death from any cause.

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^116auiTu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

While JNC 8 offers improvements over JNC 7 with a laudable dedication to high‐quality randomized evidence‐based recommendations, it leaves open some areas of improvement for the new ACC/AHA committee. By focusing solely on RCTs, we are left with areas of uncertainty where high‐quality observational studies could help elucidate effective recommendations to ultimately achieve the goal of improving hypertension control and the health of our patients. By creating a higher SBP treatment threshold for people > 60 years old, the very group who are at the highest CVD risk, implementation of JNC 8 recommendations could mean that > 6 million people in this category may not be started on treatment and an additional 13.5 million may have their treatment target liberalized, with potential detrimental consequences. 29

While the previous BP target of < 140/90 mm Hg could be liberalized for patients who are frail or > 80 years old, adopting these new guidelines in persons aged 60 to 80 years may lead to a resurgence of stroke rates. More research is needed, particularly on the use of estimated ASCVD risk cut‐points to inform therapeutic antihypertensive targets, but the new ACC/AHA hypertension guideline committee should consider a risk‐based treatment approach for adults > 60 years of age by; for example, initiating BP treatment for those with SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg based on a ≥ 7.5% 10‐year ASCVD risk score. Finally, the results from SPRINT will further undermine the JNC 8 recommendations and will likely result in a paradigm shift in how we treat hypertension.

### The role of antihypertensive drugs in elderly patients… [^117HztmJ]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Although the role of antihypertensive therapy, particularly with diuretics and beta blockers, has been well studied in adult patients, this treatment may be less effective, or even harmful, in patients over 80 years of age. A group of international researchers conducted a meta-analysis to determine if antihypertensive treatment is beneficial in patients over 80 years of age. The authors used personal contacts, literature review and the Cochrane Collaboration to identify randomized, controlled trials of anti-hypertensive therapy. Data on patients over 80 years of age were requested directly from the investigators. The five eligible trials included 1, 670 patients who were 80 years of age or older and who were followed for an average of 3. 5 years. Participants in the study group were predominately women, with a mean age of 83 years, a range of 80 to 99 years and a mean blood pressure of 180/84 mm Hg. Only 7 percent of the patients smoked and 14 percent had diabetes.

Previous myocardial infarction was reported by 5 percent of patients, and previous stroke was reported by 4 percent. Investigators compared the occurrence of stroke, cardiovascular death, major cardiovascular events and congestive heart failure in both treated and nontreated elderly hypertensive patients. The rate of 57 strokes and 34 deaths from stroke in the 874 treated patients was significantly lower than the rate of 77 strokes and 28 deaths from stroke in the 796 control subjects. The authors calculate that antihypertensive therapy prevented about one third of strokes and that 100 patients would need to be treated each year to prevent one nonfatal stroke. In the treated patients, the rate of major cardiovascular events was reduced by 22 percent and the rate of heart failure was reduced by 39 percent. In contrast, in the double-blind trials, the rate of cardiovascular deaths increased by 11 percent and the rate of total mortality increased by 14 percent.

The authors discussed the difficulties of conducting studies on this topic and the problems associated with pooling data from several studies in meta-analysis. They conclude that the results concerning cardiovascular deaths and total mortality are inconclusive, but that treatment showed clear benefit in the avoidance of stroke, major cardiovascular events and heart failure in patients older than 80 years of age.

### Hypertension management in older and frail older patients [^1169FZr7]. Circulation Research (2019). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of arterial hypertension, particularly systolic hypertension, is constantly rising worldwide. This is mainly the clinical expression of arterial stiffening as a result of the population's aging. Chronic elevation in blood pressure represents a major risk factor not only for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality but also for cognitive decline and loss of autonomy later in life. Clinical evidence obtained in community-dwelling older people with few comorbidities and preserved autonomy supports the beneficial effects of lowering blood pressure in older hypertensive subjects even after the age of 80 years. However, observational studies in frail older individuals treated for hypertension have shown higher morbidity and mortality rates compared with those with lower blood pressure levels. Clearly, in very old subjects, the therapeutic strategy of one size fits all cannot be applied because of the enormous functional heterogeneity in these individuals. Geriatric medicine proposes taking into account the function/frailty/autonomy status of older people. In the present review, we propose to adapt the antihypertensive treatment using an easy-to-apply visual numeric scale allowing the identification of 3 different patient profiles according to the functional status and autonomy for activities of daily living. For the preserved function profile, strategies should be those proposed for younger old adults. For the loss of function/preserved activities of daily living' profile, a more detailed geriatric assessment is needed to define the benefit/risk balance as well as requirements for the tailoring of the various therapeutic strategies. Lastly, for the loss of function and altered activities of daily living' profile, therapeutic strategies should be thoroughly reassessed, including deprescribing (when considered appropriate). In the near future, controlled trials are necessary for the most frail older subjects (ie, in those systematically excluded from previous clinical trials) to gain stronger evidence regarding the benefits of the various therapeutic strategies.

### Blood pressure control among older adults with hypertension: narrative review and introduction of a framework for improving care [^112DK389]. American Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Although antihypertensive medications are effective, inexpensive, and recommended by clinical practice guidelines, a large percentage of older adults with hypertension have uncontrolled blood pressure (BP). Improving BP control in this population may require a better understanding of the specific challenges to BP control at older age. In this narrative review, we propose a framework for considering how key steps in BP management occur in the context of aging characterized by heterogeneity in function, multiple co-occurring health conditions, and complex personal and environmental factors. We review existing literature related to 4 necessary steps in hypertension control. These steps include the BP measure which can be affected by the technique, device, and setting in which BP is measured. Ensuring proper technique can be challenging in routine care. The plan includes setting BP treatment goals. Lower BP goals may be appropriate for many older adults. However, plans must take into account the generalizability of existing evidence, as well as patient and family's health goals. Treatment includes the management strategy, the expected benefits, and potential risks of treatment. Treatment intensification is commonly needed and can contribute to polypharmacy in older adults. Lastly, monitor refers to the need for ongoing follow-up to support a patient's ability to sustain BP control over time. Sustained BP control has been shown to be associated with a lower rate of cardiovascular disease and multimorbidity progression. Implementation of current guidelines in populations of older adults may be improved when specific challenges to BP measurement, planning, treating, and monitoring are addressed.

Consider using all major drug classes in older patients with isolated systolic HTN because of the frequent coexistence of compelling indications and the need for combination therapy to control SBP.
Initiate treatment with a two-drug combination in most non-frail older patients with isolated systolic HTN.

### Polypharmacy in the aging patient: management of hypertension in octogenarians [^112Av3as]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hypertension treatment is beneficial for most hypertensive patients. The benefits for patients who are very old and frail, especially those taking numerous medications, are less certain.

Objective

To provide recommendations for the evaluation and treatment of hypertension among patients aged 80 years and older.

Evidence Acquisition

MEDLINE, PubMed Central, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched from inception through April 2015, with an emphasis on 2010–2015. Manual cross-referencing of review articles and meta-analyses was also performed to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining antihypertensive use in octogenarians. The search strategy included the following Medical Subject Headings: hypertension or high blood pressure and trials and oldest old or very old or very elderly.

Findings

Six post hoc analyses of the previously published Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial (HYVET) met the inclusion criteria. In the only placebo-controlled RCT on hypertension management in patients older than 80 years (HYVET; N = 3845), the treatment was associated with lower total mortality and key cardiovascular end points but the effect on stroke (fatal and nonfatal), which was the primary outcome, failed to reach the significance level (P = 0.06). Post hoc analyses of HYVET suggested that active hypertension treatment in very elderly patients was beneficial by reducing blood pressure in individuals with white coat hypertension, showed moderate benefits of the active treatment for cognition, a possible effect for fractures prevention, and sustained differences in reductions of total mortality and cardiovascular mortality in those receiving active treatment. However, patients were community dwelling and less disabled than individuals of the same age in general.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hypertensive patients who are healthy, functionally independent, and aged 80 years and older should be treated according to current recommendations for people older than 65 years. There is insufficient evidence regarding the benefits of hypertension treatment for frail polymedicated octogenarians, for whom treatment should be individualized.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to indications for treatment, elderly, AAFP/ACP 2017 guidelines recommend to initiate treatment in adults ≥ 60 years of age with SBP persistently ≥ 150 mmHg to achieve a target SBP of < 150 mmHg to reduce the risk for mortality, stroke, and cardiac events.

### Advancing risk-based approaches in blood pressure management: reflections on the 2025 AHA / ACC statement [^1168APub]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

According to the 2017 Guideline, 68 million individuals had uncontrolled hypertension and were recommended for antihypertensive therapy; of these, 35 million were untreated, and 33 million were receiving treatment but had not attained target BP levels. We advocate for the application of risk stratification to guide priority interventions in both cohorts, informing optimal escalation strategies for those inadequately controlled, and prioritizing interventions to address nontreatment in the untreated population. Drawing a parallel with lipid-lowering therapy, it is both rational and evidence-based to ensure that individuals at the highest risk receive the most effective — and, where appropriate, more intensive — therapeutic regimens. We propose that BP-lowering interventions should be classified by intensity, analogous to lipid-lowering therapies: low, moderate, and high intensity, corresponding to reductions in systolic BP of < 10, 10 to 19, and ≥ 20 mm Hg, respectively. Those at the highest absolute risk should generally be prioritized for high-intensity regimens, provided adverse effects do not preclude their use. Achieving a mean SBP of ≤ 120 mm Hg is essential to maintain the majority of BP readings below 130/80 mm Hg over time, given the natural intraindividual variability in BP. Thus, all patients with untreated mean SBP > 140 mm Hg will require high-intensity regimens to attain and sustain optimal BP control and minimize cardiovascular risk. The substantial expansion of high-intensity therapy should therefore be directed primarily towards individuals at the highest absolute risk and with the greatest gap to achieving optimal BP. Given the heightened urgency in patients with high predicted risk, immediate pharmacological intervention — potentially with dual therapy — should be considered as the default strategy. Naturally, this approach must be tailored to patient preferences and tolerability; nonetheless, the evidence increasingly supports early, decisive intervention in those most likely to benefit.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^1173Daym]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Older patients with hypertension (defined as aged ≥ 65 years) — trial evidence and treatment target recommendations are as follows: The SPRINT trial included a high proportion of patients over the age of 75 years (n = 2636) and with more intensive BP-lowering treatment (mean achieved BP = 124/62 mmHg) significantly reduced major CV events, heart failure, and all-cause death (all by > 30%) compared with standard treatment targeting SBP to < 140 mmHg; because automated office BP measurement was used, the SBP of 124 mmHg most probably reflects a conventional office SBP range of 130–139 mmHg. The HYVET trial suggested benefit when treating to an SBP target of < 150 mmHg (achieving a mean SBP of 144 mmHg) in the very old (> 80 years). Based on these data, we recommend that in older patients treated for hypertension, BP should be lowered to < 140/90 mmHg, but not below an SBP of 130 mmHg, and the impact of BP-lowering on the well-being of the patient should be closely monitored.
