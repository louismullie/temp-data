## Question

Abscess

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about abscess management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical entity and scope. Then, I should classify abscesses by complexity and anatomic site. Next, I will review diagnostic strategies, including when to use ultrasound and cultures. After that, I need to outline source control with incision and drainage, including technique nuances. Then, I will weigh the role of antibiotics in uncomplicated versus complicated cases and choose agents with MRSA coverage. Finally, I should address special populations, recurrence prevention, and follow-up, and close with a concise decision algorithm that integrates evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the definition and epidemiology so I don't gloss over fundamentals. A skin abscess is a localized collection of pus within the dermis and deeper tissues, typically due to bacterial infection, with MRSA being the predominant pathogen in many settings, and the global incidence estimated around 1861 per 100,000 person-years, which underscores how common this is in practice [^80d264ed] [^ab27a038].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment before I classify the abscess. I need to distinguish uncomplicated from complicated disease. Uncomplicated abscesses are superficial, well-circumscribed, without extension into deeper tissues or multiloculation, and without systemic toxicity, whereas complicated abscesses involve deeper structures, significant cellulitis, immunocompromise, or systemic inflammatory response, and this classification drives whether antibiotics are indicated and how aggressive source control must be [^1949fbf9] [^2c9ce396] [^a3ba1a9a].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach when the exam is equivocal. Point-of-care ultrasound improves differentiation of abscess from cellulitis and can reveal multiloculation or proximity to neurovascular structures, changing management in a meaningful fraction of cases; I should use POCUS when the diagnosis is uncertain or when planning drainage near sensitive areas [^996f4ab4] [^da21d1a1] [^b1587756].

> I should confirm when to obtain cultures, because I don't want to overcall it. For uncomplicated abscesses treated with drainage alone, routine cultures are not required; however, I should obtain cultures in recurrent abscesses, immunocompromised hosts, severe infections, outbreaks, or when antibiotics are planned, since this can guide therapy and detect resistance patterns [^7d14c678] [^2588b2ec] [^1949fbf9].

> Next, I will examine source control, because drainage is the cornerstone. Incision and drainage is the primary therapy for uncomplicated abscesses; loop drainage is a reasonable alternative that may reduce pain, packing needs, and return visits, and in RCT data it was noninferior to traditional I&D with fewer complications, which I should keep in mind when choosing technique [^1949fbf9] [^ae60f08c] [^814a04b6].

> Let me think about antibiotics in uncomplicated disease, and I should double-check the magnitude of benefit. High-quality RCTs and subsequent guidelines show that adding TMP-SMX or clindamycin to I&D modestly improves short-term cure and reduces recurrence by about 13% absolute risk, but adverse effects are more common with clindamycin; thus, the recommendation is a weak endorsement of antibiotics with shared decision-making, and if chosen, TMP-SMX is preferred over clindamycin due to lower diarrhea risk [^68e5ad45] [^89221378] [^05142f78].

> But wait, what if the abscess is complicated or the patient is systemically ill. I need to ensure I escalate appropriately. In complicated abscesses, or when there are systemic signs, immunocompromise, or extensive cellulitis, antibiotics are indicated; empiric therapy should cover MRSA and be tailored to local epidemiology, with options including TMP-SMX, clindamycin, doxycycline, or IV agents such as vancomycin, linezolid, or daptomycin depending on severity and patient factors [^2c9ce396] [^1949fbf9] [^aae3b9a9].

> I should confirm duration and whether size modifies effect. For uncomplicated abscesses when antibiotics are used, a 5–10 day course is typical, and a trial subgroup suggested higher cure with 10 days versus 5–7, whereas abscess size ≤ 5 cm did not modify the antibiotic effect; I should individualize duration to clinical response and tolerability [^f1e8bf20].

> Let me consider special anatomic sites so I don't miss nuances. For peritonsillar abscess, needle aspiration or incision and drainage plus antibiotics are standard, with close observation for airway compromise; for pilonidal disease with abscess, incision and drainage is indicated acutely; for hidradenitis suppurativa flares, I should avoid routine antibiotics unless there is secondary infection and prioritize dermatology follow-up and disease-modifying therapy; for intra-abdominal abscesses, image-guided drainage is essential given high mortality if undrained [^4f0d2979] [^cfd07bc3] [^c738c62c] [^02061f43].

> I need to check recurrence prevention because it's a common pain point. In patients with recurrent S. aureus abscesses, decolonization with intranasal mupirocin, chlorhexidine body washes, and decontamination of personal items can reduce recurrence; I should also evaluate for local drivers such as pilonidal disease, hidradenitis, or foreign material, and in early childhood recurrences consider neutrophil disorders [^18a44489] [^0a15806b] [^800f3a25].

> Hold on, I should verify follow-up expectations and safety netting. Most uncomplicated abscesses heal within 1–2 weeks after drainage; patients should return for persistent pain, spreading erythema, fever, or non-healing, and I should reassess for alternative diagnoses or inadequate source control if failure occurs [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision algorithm, and I will double-check it aligns with guidelines. If the lesion is a simple, superficial abscess without systemic signs, I&D alone is first-line; if the patient prefers to reduce recurrence modestly, offer TMP-SMX or clindamycin with shared decision-making and prefer TMP-SMX; if the abscess is complicated, the patient is immunocompromised, or there are systemic signs, give antibiotics with MRSA coverage and ensure timely source control; if the diagnosis is uncertain, use POCUS; if the patient has recurrent abscesses, pursue decolonization and evaluate for underlying drivers [^1949fbf9] [^89221378] [^996f4ab4] [^18a44489].

An abscess is a **localized collection of pus** within tissue, most often due to Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA) [^80d264ed] [^ab27a038]. Diagnosis is **clinical**, with fluctuance and tenderness guiding the need for incision and drainage (I&D) [^ab27a038]; ultrasound helps distinguish abscess from cellulitis when uncertain [^996f4ab4] [^c86d6864]. I&D is the **cornerstone of therapy** [^1949fbf9]; antibiotics are added for systemic features, immunocompromise, or failure of local therapy [^2c9ce396] [^22bde77c]. Recurrent abscesses warrant evaluation for hidradenitis, pilonidal disease, or immunodeficiency, and decolonization may reduce recurrence [^0a15806b] [^800f3a25] [^18a44489].

---

## Etiology and pathophysiology

- **Common pathogens**: Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA) is the most frequent cause; beta-hemolytic streptococci are also common [^ab27a038] [^c86d6864].
- **Risk factors**: Skin trauma, poor hygiene, diabetes, immunocompromise, and chronic skin conditions (e.g. hidradenitis suppurativa) increase risk [^80d264ed].
- **Pathophysiology**: Bacterial invasion triggers inflammation, neutrophil recruitment, and pus formation (necrotic tissue, neutrophils, and bacteria) [^80d264ed].

---

## Clinical presentation

Typical features include a **painful, erythematous, fluctuant mass** with induration and localized warmth; systemic features such as fever and malaise may occur in more extensive infections [^ab27a038]. Common sites are the axilla, groin, buttocks, extremities, and perianal region [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Clinical diagnosis**: Usually sufficient; look for fluctuance, tenderness, and erythema [^ab27a038].
- **Ultrasound**: Useful to differentiate abscess from cellulitis or to detect occult collections, especially in children or obese patients [^996f4ab4] [^0bc66a5f].
- **Imaging**: CT or MRI for deep or complex abscesses (e.g. intra-abdominal, spinal, or brain abscesses) [^02061f43] [^2e3c2781].
- **Cultures**: Obtain from recurrent, complex, or treatment-resistant cases to guide therapy and detect MRSA [^2588b2ec] [^7d14c678].

---

## Management

### General principles

General principles include **source control** — incision and drainage is the primary therapy for most abscesses [^1949fbf9] — and **antibiotic stewardship**, reserving antibiotics for select indications to limit resistance and adverse effects [^89221378].

---

### Indications for antibiotics

Antibiotics are indicated when any of the following are present:

| **Indication** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Systemic signs (fever, tachycardia, leukocytosis) | Suggests systemic infection or sepsis [^1949fbf9] |
| Immunocompromise | Increased risk of complications and failure [^2c9ce396] |
| Failure of I&D alone | Persistent or recurrent infection [^5af69e03] |
| Extensive cellulitis or rapid progression | Concern for deeper infection or necrotizing process [^2c9ce396] |

---

### Antibiotic selection

- **MRSA coverage**: TMP-SMX, clindamycin, or doxycycline are first-line oral options for suspected MRSA [^ea2ad945] [^4da44506].
- **Beta-lactams**: Use for MSSA or streptococcal infections when MRSA risk is low [^4da44506].
- **Parenteral therapy**: Vancomycin, linezolid, or daptomycin for severe infections or hospitalized patients [^aae3b9a9].

---

### Surgical techniques

- **Traditional I&D**: Linear incision along the axis of the cavity, irrigation, and packing [^notfound].
- **Loop drainage**: Minimally invasive technique with lower pain and fewer recurrences; noninferior to traditional I&D [^ae60f08c].
- **Primary closure**: Consider in selected cases for faster healing and cosmesis, with similar recurrence rates [^9071fad3].

---

## Complications

Complications include **recurrence** — common without adequate source control or in chronic conditions like hidradenitis or pilonidal disease [^0a15806b] — and **progression** to cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, or sepsis, especially in immunocompromised hosts [^2e3c2781]. Chronic morbidity such as scarring, fistula formation, and chronic infection can occur [^3f5f4e44].

---

## Prevention and recurrence management

Prevention and recurrence management focus on **hygiene**, patient education on wound care and hand hygiene, and **decolonization** with intranasal mupirocin and chlorhexidine baths for recurrent MRSA abscesses [^18a44489]. Evaluate for underlying causes — such as hidradenitis, pilonidal disease, diabetes, or immunodeficiency — in recurrent cases [^0a15806b] [^800f3a25].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Higher prevalence of MRSA; ultrasound aids diagnosis; conservative management for small renal abscesses [^0bc66a5f] [^c63e7a64].
- **Immunocompromised patients**: Lower threshold for imaging, cultures, and broad-spectrum antibiotics [^bed0efd7] [^c7c42a04].
- **Deep or complex abscesses**: Require imaging, surgical consultation, and prolonged antibiotic therapy [^02061f43] [^b3ea428c].

---

Abscesses are common infections requiring **source control and judicious antibiotics**; I&D remains the foundation, with antibiotics reserved for systemic illness, immunocompromise, or failure of local therapy. Recurrent disease demands evaluation for underlying causes and targeted prevention strategies.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^60f646c9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

IDSA 2014 SSTI guideline—cutaneous abscess and inflamed epidermoid cyst management emphasizes that aspiration was successful in only 25% of cases overall and <10% with MRSA infections, and accordingly, this form of treatment is not recommended. Simply covering the surgical site with a dry dressing is usually the easiest and most effective treatment of the wound, and one small study found that packing caused more pain and did not improve healing when compared to just covering the incision site with sterile gauze. The addition of systemic antibiotics to incision and drainage of cutaneous abscesses does not improve cure rates, even in those due to MRSA, but systemic antibiotics should be given to patients with severely impaired host defenses or signs or symptoms of systemic infection; multiple abscesses, extremes of age, and lack of response to incision and drainage alone are additional settings in which systemic antimicrobial therapy should be considered.

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: a clinical practice guideline [^9de8b8a0]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Identifying the infecting pathogen may not be necessary for treating uncomplicated skin abscesses, but cultures can provide helpful information in patients with recurrent abscesses or systemic illness.The most common pathogens are Staphylococcus aureus, most often methicillin-resistant (MRSA), and several other bacteria, most originating from the skin flora.MRSA accounts for a substantial number of visits by patients with skin and soft tissue infections.

Table 1 summarises current management guidelines, which do not recommend antibiotics for uncomplicated skin abscesses.

How the recommendation was created

The scope of the recommendation and the outcomes important to patients were defined by an international guideline panel consisting of two adults with lived experience of skin abscesses, one adult with lived experience as a carer for a child with skin abscess, five general practitioners, three paediatric or adult infectious disease physicians, four general internists, a general paediatrician, a dermatologist, and several health research methodologists. They requested a systematic review on the benefits and harms of different antibiotics to inform the recommendation.The panel then met online to discuss the evidence and to formulate specific recommendations. As with all BMJ Rapid Recommendations, no panel member had financial conflicts of interest; intellectual and professional conflicts were minimised and managed (see appendix 1 on bmj.com).

The panel followed the BMJ Rapid Recommendations procedures for creating a trustworthy recommendation, including using the GRADE approach to critically appraise the evidence and to move from evidence to recommendations (appendix 2 on bmj.com).The panel initially identified patient-important outcomes and subgroup hypotheses needed to inform the recommendation. When creating the recommendation, the panel considered the balance of benefits, harms, costs, burdens of the treatments, the quality of evidence for each outcome, typical patient values and preferences and their expected variations, as well as acceptability.Recommendations can be strong or weak, for or against a course of action. The recommendations take a patient-centred perspective which de-emphasises public health, societal, and health payer point of view.

### Intra-abdominal abscess (...) [^02061f43]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

THE LETHAL nature of intraabdominal abscesses is evident from published rates of mortality that range from 30% in treated patients to 80% to 100% in patients with undrained abscesses. 1-3 However, recent advances in diagnostic radiology have substantially altered the investigative approach and therapeutic alternatives for such patients. The new noninvasive cross-sectional imaging modalities of ultrasonography and body computed tomography have both been extremely effective diagnostic modalities for abscess detection, while radionuclide abscessimaging agents have also been introduced that demonstrate considerable accuracy in detection of septic foci, both within the abdominal cavity and in extra-abdominal locations.

Finally, invasive interventional radiological techniques for percutaneous diagnostic needle-aspiration of fluid collections under ultrasonographic or CT guidance have been widely employed and can be followed by percutaneous catheter drainage for definitive non-surgical therapy. This article outlines some of the emerging trends in the diagnosis and treatment of intraabdominal abscess by radiological means. CROSS-SECTIONAL Ferrucci JT, vanSonnenberg E.

### Clinical immunology review series: an approach to the patient with recurrent superficial abscesses [^3f5f4e44]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Patients may be referred to the immunology clinic for investigation of recurrent superficial abscess formation. In the majority of adult patients this clinical presentation does not equate with an underlying primary immune deficiency. Nevertheless, recurrent mucocutaneous abscesses can be associated with significant morbidity and long-term complications, including scarring and fistula formation, and may be associated with underlying immune-mediated disease. This review sets out an approach to the patient with recurrent superficial abscesses, focusing on the differential diagnoses, investigation and management of both the common causes and those associated with specific immune deficiency.

### Management of cutaneous abscesses by dermatologists [^0a1985fc]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Importance

There is currently no data detailing the degree to which dermatologists follow CDC/Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines in the treatment of abscesses, which recommend that incision and drainage (I+D) as primary therapy for skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI).

Objective

To evaluate the management of skin abscesses by dermatologists.

Design, Setting, Participants

A national email survey of 780 dermatologists was conducted from May-June 2012. Awareness, experience, and preparedness of respondents for abscess treatment, as well as the treatment practices in different clinical scenarios were evaluated. Response rate = 65% (n=510).

Eligibility Criteria

board certified/eligible dermatologists practicing in US. Main practice affiliation: solo (20%), group (33%), university health system/academic (32%), multi-specialty (13%), and other (2%). Main practice setting: urban (49%), suburban (42%), and rural (9%).

Main Outcome and Measures

Practitioner report of: awareness of national guidelines, use of I+D in initial management of uncomplicated abscess found on face, trunk, and extremity on patients age 6 months, 3, 15, 50, and 80 years, and use of antibiotics in the initial management.

Results

99% of respondents were capable of performing I+D in their practice. The IDSA recommends cultures in all patients treated with antibiotic therapy, and does not recommend antibiotics for the treatment of simple abscess. 18% of respondents reported culturing abscesses less than 50% of the time, while 91% incorporated antibiotics into initial treatment. Nearly a quarter (24%) of respondents would choose an initial antibiotic that would not cover Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). For facial abscesses, as the age of the patient increased from infant, respondents were more likely to incorporate I+D into their initial treatment. For abscesses on the trunk and extremities, respondents were less likely to I+D infants and toddlers, compared to adolescents, adults and the elderly.

Conclusion

Although most dermatologists were prepared to manage uncomplicated abscesses (98%), this survey identifies gaps in clinical standards of care established by the CDC/IDSA. Identification of these practice gaps may impact physician practice and dermatology residency curricula, and may serve to improve abscess management and antibacterial stewardship in the outpatient setting.

### Diagnosis and management of cellulitis and abscess in the emergency department setting: an evidence-based review [^c86d6864]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Cellulitis and abscess are a common reason for presentation to the emergency department, although there are several nuances to the care of these patients.

Objective

The purpose of this narrative review article was to provide a summary of the background, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of cellulitis and abscesses with a focus on emergency clinicians.

Discussion

The most common bacteria causing cellulitis are Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and other β-hemolytic streptococci, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus is most common in abscesses. The history and physical examination are helpful in differentiating cellulitis and abscess in many cases, and point-of-care ultrasound can be a useful tool in unclear cases. Treatment for cellulitis typically involves a penicillin or cephalosporin, and treatment of abscesses is incision and drainage. Loop drainage is preferred over the traditional incision and drainage technique, and adjunctive antibiotics can be considered. Most patients can be managed as outpatient.

Conclusions

It is essential for emergency physicians to be aware of the current evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of patients with cellulitis and abscess.

Education into practice

Do you currently consider antibiotics for patients with uncomplicated skin abscesses after surgical treatment?
What information could you share with your patient to help reach a decision together?
Would you consider using online decision aid tools (such as the one available on MAGICapp) to facilitate shared decision making?

How patients were involved in the creation of this article

Three people with lived experience of skin abscesses were full panel members: two had previously experienced skin abscesses before (one with recurrent abscesses), and one person is a parent of a child who experienced a skin abscess. These panel members identified patient-important outcomes, and led the discussion on values and preferences. These patient partners agreed that, although pain reduction was the most important outcome to them, these values may not be shared by all patients. The close balance between desirable and undesirable consequences made it difficult for them (and the panel) to decide which options most individuals would choose.

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: a clinical practice guideline [^ab27a038]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Current understanding

A skin abscess is an isolated collection of pus within the dermis and deeper skin tissues. Uncomplicated skin abscesses are collections of pus within the skin structures and are usually caused by bacterial infections. Careful history and clinical examination are usually sufficient to diagnose a skin abscess.Skin abscesses present as single or multiple tender, erythematous, indurated nodules, often surrounded by an area of erythema or swelling.Fluctuance beneath the skin often indicates a fluid filled cavity. There may be a pustule at the area where the abscess is closest to the skin or spontaneous drainage of pus.The use of point-of-care ultrasonography can help differentiate an abscess from other soft tissue infections in the emergency department.

Skin infections are common. More than 4% of people seek treatment for skin infections annually in the United States.In European countries, it may be less common: in Belgium and the Netherlands about 0.5-0.6% visit their general practitioner with bacterial skin infections each year.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^d6a675bb]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What is the appropriate treatment of superficial infections (impetigo, erysipelas and cellulitis, and superficial abscesses)?

We recommend that impetigo, erysipelas, and cellulitis should be managed by antibiotics against Gram-positive bacteria (recommendation 1C).

Empiric therapy for community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA or who do not respond to first line therapy (recommendation 1C).

Incision and drainage is the primary treatment for simple abscesses or boils. We recommend not to use antibiotics for simple abscesses or boils (recommendation 1C).

Superficial infections encompass either superficial spreading infection and inflammation within the epidermis and dermis that may be treated with antibiotics alone or a well-circumscribed abscess that may be treated by drainage alone.

Physical examination usually reveals erythema, tenderness, and induration. The majority of superficial SSTIs are caused by Gram-positive bacteria, particularly streptococci and S. aureus. The three common presentations of superficial infections consist of impetigo, erysipelas, and cellulitis. They are managed by antibiotic therapy against Gram-positive bacteria.

Impetigo is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the superficial layers of the epidermis. Impetigo predominantly affects children, and it is one of the most common SSTI in children worldwide. It is characterized by discrete purulent lesions nearly always caused by β-hemolytic Streptococcus spp. and/or S. aureus. Moreover, of particular concern is the rising role of CA-MRSA as impetigo’s etiological agent.

Erysipelas is a fiery red, tender, painful plaque with well-demarcated edges and is commonly caused by streptococcal species, usually Staphylococcus pyogenes. S. aureus rarely causes erysipelas. Streptococci are the primary cause of erysipelas. Most facial infections are attributed to group A Streptococcus (GAS), with an increasing percentage of lower extremity infections being caused by non-GAS. The role of S. aureus, and specifically MRSA, remains controversial.

### Loop drainage is noninferior to traditional incision and drainage of cutaneous abscesses in the emergency department [^ae60f08c]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

There is limited research on loop drainage (LD) compared to incision and drainage (I&D) for treatment of cutaneous abscesses. We investigated whether LD was noninferior to I&D for abscess resolution and whether there was any difference in repeat ED visits or complication rates between these techniques.

Methods

We performed a prospective randomized controlled trial, using a convenience sample at an urban academic emergency department (ED). Subjects over 18 years who presented for first-time management of an abscess were eligible. Patients requiring specialist drainage or hospital admission or had previous treatment for the abscess were excluded. Enrolled subjects were seen 2 weeks after treatment for blinded reevaluation of abscess resolution, and the electronic medical record was reviewed for return ED visits/abscess complications.

Results

Of 2,889 patients screened, 238 subjects consented and were randomized to LD or I&D. Abscess resolution was achieved in 53/65 (81.5%) of patients in the I&D arm, compared to 66/75 (88%) in the LD arm. Fewer patients in the LD group compared to the I&D group returned to the ED for abscess-related management during the following 14 days (37.3% vs 67.1%, p = 0.002). Among returning subjects, there was a significant difference in mean visits per subject between LD and I&D groups (0.5 vs. 1.2, p = 0.001). There were fewer complications among LD than I&D subjects (9.3% vs. 24.6%, p = 0.01).

Conclusion

Our study provides evidence that LD is noninferior to I&D in achieving complete abscess resolution at 14 days and is associated with fewer return ED visits and fewer complications. This makes it an attractive alternative treatment option for abscesses.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^73fb6948]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What is the appropriate treatment of complex abscesses (perianal and perirectal, and abscesses in intravenous drug injection sites)?

Complex skin and subcutaneous abscesses are typically well circumscribed and respond to incision and drainage. We recommend antibiotic therapy if systemic signs of infection are present, in immunocompromised patients, if source control is incomplete or in cases of abscess with significant cellulitis (recommendation 1C).

We recommend empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy with coverage of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria (recommendation 1C).

Common sites of origin of complex abscesses may be perineal or perianal, perirectal, and abscesses at intravenous drug injection sites. Complicated skin and subcutaneous abscesses are typically well circumscribed and respond to incision and drainage with adjuvant antibiotic therapy.

Perianal and perirectal abscesses originate most often from an obstructed anal crypt gland, with the resultant pus collecting in the subcutaneous tissue, intersphincteric plane, or beyond (ischiorectal space or supralevator space) where various types of anorectal abscesses form. Once diagnosed, anorectal abscesses should be promptly drained surgically. An undrained anorectal abscess can continue to expand into adjacent spaces as well as progress to generalized systemic infection. Anorectal abscess occurs more often in males than females. Most patients present between the ages of 20 to 60 with the mean age of 40 in both sexes.

The diagnosis of anorectal abscess is usually based on the patient’s history and physical examination. The most common symptom of anorectal abscess is pain. As such, it has to be differentiated from other causes of anal pain including anal fissure, thrombosed hemorrhoids, levator spasm, sexually transmitted diseases, proctitis, and cancer. Low (intersphincteric, perianal, and ischiorectal) abscesses are usually associated with swelling, cellulites, and exquisite tenderness, but few systemic symptoms. High (submucosal, supralevator) abscesses may have few local symptoms, but significant systemic symptoms. Deeper abscesses, such as those that form in the supralevator or high ischiorectal space, may also present with pain referred to the perineum, low back, or buttocks.

Cryptococcus—cutaneous involvement and management: Single or multiple painless skin lesions involving the face and scalp develop in 5%–10% of clinically infected patients and may precede cryptococcal meningitis by several weeks. Fluconazole is often used as initial treatment for patients with mild infections or to complete treatment after clinical and microbiologic improvement with amphotericin B and 5‑flucytosine induction therapy, and surgical debridement and/or drainage are not helpful in the management of skin or soft tissue cryptococcal infections.

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: a clinical practice guideline [^4fc6c807]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

The panel is confident that the evidence applies to almost all patients with uncomplicated skin abscesses treated with incision and drainage: adults and children, patients presenting to emergency departments and to primary care practices, smaller and larger abscesses, first abscess occurrences and recurrences, and abscesses with unknown infection pathogens. The systematic review and meta-analyses contained adequate representation from such groups and settings, and results were consistent between pre-specified subgroups.

Values and preferences

The panel believes that there is a high degree of variability between patients and carers weighing the expected desirable and undesirable consequences of antibiotic therapy compared with no antibiotic therapy. This variation is reflected in the weak recommendation, which warrants shared decision making to ensure that each individual’s decision is in line with what they consider most important. The expected benefit of antibiotic therapy in reducing pain, risk of treatment failure, and recurrence is modest, but large enough that the panel anticipates that most fully informed patients would value these benefits sufficiently to choose antibiotic treatment. This might particularly be the case when, for example, the abscess is very painful, perhaps because of location in sensitive places (such as groin, axillae, etc).

For patients who decide to initiate antibiotic treatment, reasonable choices include either TMP-SMX or clindamycin. In some settings, cephalosporins or other antibiotics are often prescribed for skin abscesses. Given that, in most circumstances, cephalosporins probably do not provide any additional benefit beyond incision and drainage alone, the panel felt that all or almost all patients would choose to use antibiotic options with proven efficacy (TMP-SMX or clindamycin), hence the strong recommendation against cephalosporins.

People who place a higher value on the possibility of avoiding abscess recurrence may choose clindamycin, while those who place a higher value on avoiding diarrhoea and on minimising costs are likely to prefer TMP-SMX.

### A placebo-controlled trial of antibiotics for smaller skin abscesses [^68e5ad45]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated skin abscesses are common, yet the appropriate management of the condition in the era of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is unclear.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter, prospective, double-blind trial involving outpatient adults and children. Patients were stratified according to the presence of a surgically drainable abscess, abscess size, the number of sites of skin infection, and the presence of nonpurulent cellulitis. Participants with a skin abscess 5 cm or smaller in diameter were enrolled. After abscess incision and drainage, participants were randomly assigned to receive clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), or placebo for 10 days. The primary outcome was clinical cure 7 to 10 days after the end of treatment.

Results

We enrolled 786 participants: 505 (64.2%) were adults and 281 (35.8%) were children. A total of 448 (57.0%) of the participants were male. S. aureus was isolated from 527 participants (67.0%), and MRSA was isolated from 388 (49.4%). Ten days after therapy in the intention-to-treat population, the cure rate among participants in the clindamycin group was similar to that in the TMP-SMX group (221 of 266 participants [83.1%] and 215 of 263 participants [81.7%], respectively; P=0.73), and the cure rate in each active-treatment group was higher than that in the placebo group (177 of 257 participants [68.9%], P<0.001 for both comparisons). The results in the population of patients who could be evaluated were similar. This beneficial effect was restricted to participants with S. aureus infection. Among the participants who were initially cured, new infections at 1 month of follow-up were less common in the clindamycin group (15 of 221, 6.8%) than in the TMP-SMX group (29 of 215 [13.5%], P=0.03) or the placebo group (22 of 177 [12.4%], P=0.06). Adverse events were more frequent with clindamycin (58 of 265 [21.9%]) than with TMP-SMX (29 of 261 [11.1%]) or placebo (32 of 255 [12.5%]); all adverse events resolved without sequelae. One participant who received TMP-SMX had a hypersensitivity reaction.

Conclusions

As compared with incision and drainage alone, clindamycin or TMP-SMX in conjunction with incision and drainage improves short-term outcomes in patients who have a simple abscess. This benefit must be weighed against the known side-effect profile of these antimicrobials. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00730028 .).

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^7ae6ae84]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the dermis and the subcutaneous tissue that most commonly affects the lower extremities, although it can affect other areas. It causes local signs of inflammation, such as warmth, erythema, pain, lymphangitis, and frequently systemic upset with fever and raised white blood cell count. As already reported in a previous paragraph, cellulitis has been recently classified as an ABSSSI together with erysipelas, SSIs, and major abscesses.

In a large European multicenter study, Garau et al. analyzed a population of patients diagnosed with complicated SSTI hospitalized between December 2010 and January 2011 reporting that cellulitis was the most frequent diagnosis accounting for 59.1% of the total. Streptococci cause diffuse, rapidly spreading infection; staphylococcal cellulitis is typically more localized.

Treatment should begin promptly with agents effective against the typical Gram-positive pathogens, especially streptococci. If the cellulitis is very early and mild and no significant co-morbidities are present, oral beta-lactams might be sufficient in areas where CA-MRSA is not prevalent. Other available options are macrolides and lincosamides; however, resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin are increasing. Fluoroquinolones have been approved for the treatment of most uncomplicated cellulitis but are not adequate for treatment of MRSA infections. For more severe infections, parenteral route is the first choice.

If MRSA is suspected (both hospital acquired MRSA [HA-MRSA] and CA-MRSA), glycopeptides and newer antimicrobials are the best options. For a simple superficial abscess or boil, incision and drainage is the primary treatment, and antibiotics are not needed. To be considered a simple abscess, induration and erythema should be limited only to a defined area of the abscess and should not extend beyond its borders. Additionally, simple abscesses do not extend into deeper tissues or have multiloculated extension. Cutaneous abscesses are typically caused by bacteria that represent the normal regional skin flora of the involved area.

### Ultrasound soft-tissue applications in the pediatric emergency department: to drain or not to drain? [^0bc66a5f]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2009). Low credibility.

Soft tissue infections frequently prompt visits to the pediatric emergency department. The incidence of these infections has increased markedly in recent years. The emergence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is associated with an increasing morbidity, mortality, and frequency of abscess formation. Bedside ultrasound may have a significant impact in the management of patients that present to the pediatric emergency department with soft tissue infections, including cellulitis, cutaneous abscess, peritonsillar abscess, and necrotizing fasciitis. Ultrasound is an efficient, noninvasive diagnostic tool which can augment the physician's clinical examination. Ultrasound has been shown to be superior to clinical judgment alone in determining the presence or the absence of occult abscess formation, ensuring appropriate management and limiting unnecessary invasive procedures.

Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM)—Although most infections occur after primary inoculation at sites of skin disruption or trauma, hematogenous dissemination does occur; in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients the most common manifestations include cutaneous and pleuropulmonary disease, and in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients catheter-related infection and bacteremia are noted. Disseminated infection with Mycobacterium avium complex occurs preferentially among patients with HIV disease, whereas bloodstream and cutaneous infections with multiple NTM species are more frequent among non-HIV-immunocompromised hosts; dermatologic manifestations include a poorly resolving cellulitis, painless 1- to 2-cm nodules, necrotic ulcers, and subcutaneous abscesses. Treatment requires prolonged combination therapy (duration, 6–12 weeks) that should consist of a macrolide antibiotic (eg, clarithromycin) and a second agent to which the isolate is susceptible, and surgical debridement is crucial for cultures and sensitivities and to promote skin and soft tissue healing.

### How do you treat an abscess in the era of increased community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)? [^118f47d7]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

In the era of increased prevalence of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), there have been a number of questions and several recent studies that address the clinical management of uncomplicated abscesses in the emergency department (ED).

Discussion

We examine the historical and clinical predictors for MRSA in patients with an uncomplicated abscess and review the evidence behind the use of wound cultures, decolonization, antibiotics, irrigation, and packing after incision and drainage. We found that current recommendations and treatment guidelines are often based on limited data, expert opinion, and anecdotal experience.

Conclusion

In light of the data currently available, antibiotics and decolonization should be used selectively, not routinely, for treatment of most uncomplicated abscesses. Wound cultures are generally not necessary in the ED, and all patients should be given return precautions for worsening symptoms.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^1d794eba]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The terms “complicated” and “uncomplicated” persist and can be useful in describing SSTIs as reported by Napolitano.

Uncomplicated SSTIs carry low risk for life- or limb-threatening infection unless they are improperly treated. Patients who have uncomplicated SSTIs can be treated with either empiric antibiotic therapy according to the most probable pathogen and local resistance patterns in impetigo, erysipelas, or mild cellulitis with drainage and debridement or simple surgical drainage in skin abscess.

Complicated SSTIs are associated with high risk for life-threatening infection. In patients who have complicated SSTIs, it is of paramount importance to initiate appropriate and adequate broad-spectrum initial empiric antibiotic therapy and to consider the need for surgical intervention for drainage and/or debridement.

In 2003, Eron et al. classified SSTIs according to the severity of local and systemic signs and the presence or absence of comorbid conditions in patients presenting in the outpatient setting to guide the clinical management, treatment, and admission decisions. In this classification system, SSTIs were divided in four classes:
Class 1: patients with SSTI, but no signs or symptoms of systemic toxicity or co-morbidities.
Class 2: patients are either systemically unwell with stable co-morbidities or are systemically well, but have a comorbidity (e.g. diabetes, obesity) that may complicate or delay resolution.
Class 3: patients appear toxic and unwell (fever, tachycardia, tachypnoea, and/or hypotension).
Class 4: patients have sepsis syndrome and life-threatening infection; for example necrotizing fasciitis.

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: a clinical practice guideline [^7c69d1d9]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

The evidence

To inform the recommendations, the guideline panel requested a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the effects of adjuvant antibiotic therapy compared with no antibiotic therapy in addition to incision and drainage in patients with uncomplicated skin abscesses.

A large RCT published in March 2016 suggested that TMP-SMX treatment resulted in a higher cure rate than placebo among patients with a drained cutaneous abscess.Another RCT published in June 2017 found that, compared with incision and drainage alone, clindamycin or TMP-SMX in addition to incision and drainage improved short term outcomes in patients who had an uncomplicated skin abscess.The Rapid Recommendations team believed these two trials, in addition to the existing body of evidence, might change practice.

Figure 1 gives an overview of the characteristics of patients and trials included in the systematic review of the effects of antibiotics on uncomplicated skin abscesses. There were 14 RCTs: eight included a comparison of antibiotics versus no antibiotics, and seven included a comparison of two different antibiotics. Explicit descriptions of abscess definitions, for each trial, were summarised in the accompanying systematic review (table C of appendix 2).The largest trial specifically focused on small abscesses (all <5 cm diameter and about half ≤2 cm) in patients who had no signs of systemic infection.The RCTs included participants with skin abscesses anywhere on the body.

Fig 1

Eleven trials reported study setting, of which nine were conducted in emergency departments,one in outpatient dermatology clinics,and one in an Integrated Soft Tissue Infection Services (ISIS) clinic involving patients with high rates of comorbidity, such as infection with hepatitis C, hepatitis B, or HIV.The RCTs included children and adults. Almost all patients underwent incision and drainage for their skin abscess. The most common pathogen was MRSA (49-88%) followed by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, 9-18%).

### Peritonsillar abscess-AAFP (...) [^4f0d2979]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Peritonsillar abscess is the most common deep infection of the head and neck, with an annual incidence of 30 cases per 100, 000 persons in the United States. 1–3 This infection can occur in all age groups, but the highest incidence occurs in adults 20 to 40 years of age. 1, 2 Peritonsillar abscess is most commonly a complication of streptococcal tonsillitis; however, a definitive correlation between the two conditions has not been documented.
4. Etiology Peritonsillar abscess has traditionally been regarded as the last stage of a continuum that begins as an acute exudative tonsillitis, which progresses to a cellulitis and eventually abscess formation. However, this assumes a close association between peritonsillar abscess and streptococcal tonsillitis.

Because the occurrence of peritonsillar abscess is evenly distributed throughout the year and streptococcal tonsillitis is generally seasonal, the role of streptococcal tonsillitis in the etiology of peritonsillar abscess has been called into question. Often, these two conditions are distinguished by the absence of pus on needle aspiration, which indicates cellulitis. If the presence of an abscess remains uncertain after needle aspiration, radiologic testing may be helpful. Computed tomography with contrast media enhancement can be used to demonstrate the presence and extent of an abscess. 13 Disadvantages of MRI include longer scanning times, higher cost, and the potential for claustrophobia.
13. 6, 7, 13 Exceptions include small abscesses without muffled voice, drooling, or trismus. The main procedures include needle aspiration, incision and drainage, or immediate tonsillectomy.

Most studies comparing different surgical methods have found that all were equally effective for the treatment of peritonsillar abscess, and there were no statistically significant differences in patient outcomes. 13, 22, 23 Complication rates are higher in patients 40 years or older compared with younger patients. 24, 25 Hospital stays averaged two to four days for all patients. 13, 19 If the decision is made to pursue outpatient management, patients should be observed for a few hours after drainage of the abscess to ensure they can tolerate oral fluids, antibiotics, and pain medications. Patients should continue to be monitored closely, with a follow-up appointment scheduled within 24 to 36 hours.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^03c5cfda]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

How should SSTIs be classified?

The term “skin and soft-tissue infections” describes a wide heterogeneity of clinical conditions. We recommend that the necrotizing or non-necrotizing character of the infection, the anatomical extension, the characteristics of the infection (purulent or not purulent), and the clinical condition of the patient should be always assessed independently to classify patients with soft-tissue infections (recommendation 1C).

SSTIs encompass a variety of pathological conditions involving the skin and underlying subcutaneous tissue, fascia, or muscle and ranging from simple superficial infections to severe necrotizing infections.

Various classification systems have been used to describe SSTIs including variables such as anatomic location, causative pathogen(s), rate of progression, depth of infection, and severity of clinical presentation.

In 1998, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classified SSTIs into two broad categories for the purpose of clinical trials evaluating new antimicrobials for their treatment: uncomplicated and complicated. Uncomplicated SSTIs included superficial infections such as cellulitis, simple abscesses, impetigo, and furuncles and required antibiotics or surgical incision for drainage of abscess alone. In contrast, complicated SSTIs included deep soft-tissue infections such as necrotizing infections, infected ulcers, infected burns, and major abscesses which required significant surgical intervention with drainage and debridement.

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: a clinical practice guideline [^9411e054]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

What role do antibiotics have in the treatment of uncomplicated skin abscesses after incision and drainage? A recent study suggested that, for small uncomplicated skin abscesses, antibiotics after incision and drainage improve the chance of short term cure compared with placebo. Triggered by this trial, the Rapid Recommendation team produced a new systematic review. Relying on this review and using the GRADE framework according to the BMJ Rapid Recommendation process, an expert panel makes a weak recommendation in favour of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX, co-trimoxazole) or clindamycin in addition to incision and drainage over incision and drainage alone. For patients who have chosen to initiate antibiotics, the panel issues a strong recommendation for TMP-SMX or clindamycin rather than a cephalosporin and a weak recommendation for TMP-SMX rather than clindamycin. Box 1 shows the articles and evidence linked to this Rapid Recommendation. The infographic presents the recommendations together with other pertinent information, including an overview of the absolute benefits and harms of candidate antibiotics in the standard GRADE format. The panel emphasises shared decision making in the choice of whether to initiate antibiotics and in which antibiotic to use, because the desirable and undesirable consequences are closely balanced: clinicians using MAGICapp will find decision aids to support the discussion with patients. Table 2 below shows any evidence that has emerged since the publication of this article.

### Optimal antibacterial treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections: applying a novel treatment algorithm [^5741c4d8]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Incision and drainage combined with antibiotic therapies form the backbone of managing uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections (uSSSIs). An algorithm has been developed to guide the treatment of uSSSIs in the primary care setting in situations where initial empiric therapy is appropriate. This includes instances when a culture is taken, but it is deemed appropriate to begin an antibiotic empirically pending the results of the culture. The panel that developed the algorithm was chaired by Dr. Richard Scher of Columbia University and included thought leaders in the fields of clinical dermatology, dermatologic surgery, infectious disease, pediatric infectious disease, podiatry, and HIV infection. The panel acknowledged that the initial choice of antibiotic is generally determined by tolerability, ease of administration, cost, and efficacy. The usual choices for initial empiric therapy include cephalosporins, penicillinase-resistant penicillins, and beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations. Currently marketed cephalosporins, penicillinase-resistant penicillins, and beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations lack activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and the increasing prevalence of community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) was a major consideration when designing the treatment algorithm. Many CA-MRSA skin infections present as abscess, and drainage is the most important component of therapy in this setting. When the history and physical exam suggest CA-MRSA infection, and there is no fluctuant collection of purulent material to be drained, a sulfa drug or tetracycline is generally the best choice for initial empiric therapy.

### Irrigation of cutaneous abscesses does not improve treatment success [^6956a36c]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Irrigation of the cutaneous abscess cavity is often described as a standard part of incision and drainage despite no randomized, controlled studies showing benefit. Our goal is to determine whether irrigation of a cutaneous abscess during incision and drainage in the emergency department (ED) decreases the need for further intervention within 30 days compared with no irrigation.

Methods

We performed a single-center, prospective, randomized, nonblinded study of ED patients receiving an incision and drainage for cutaneous abscess, randomized to irrigation or no irrigation. Patient characteristics and postprocedure pain visual analog scale score were obtained. Thirty-day telephone follow-up was conducted with a standardized data form examining need for further intervention, which was defined as repeated incision and drainage, antibiotic change, or abscess-related hospital admission.

Results

Of 209 enrolled patients, 187 completed follow-up. The irrigation and no-irrigation groups were similar with respect to diabetes, immunocompromise, fever, abscess size, cellulitis, and abscess location, but the irrigation group was younger (mean age 36 versus 40 years) and more often treated with packing (89% versus 75%) and outpatient antibiotics (91% versus 73%). The need for further intervention was not different in the irrigation (15%) and no-irrigation (13%) groups (difference 2%; 95% confidence interval -8% to 12%). There was no difference in pain visual analog scale scores (5.6 versus 5.7; difference 0.1; 95% confidence interval -0.7 to 0.9).

Conclusion

Although there were baseline differences between groups, irrigation of the abscess cavity during incision and drainage did not decrease the need for further intervention.

### Loop drainage of cutaneous abscesses using a modified sterile glove: a promising technique [^814a04b6]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Cutaneous abscesses are a common clinical condition treated effectively with incision and drainage.

Objective

Placement of subcutaneous loop drains to facilitate healing of these infections has been described, but has yet to gain widespread adoption in clinical practice.

Discussion

This article includes instructions for how to perform this technique using materials available in the emergency setting, as well as a discussion of the potential advantages and disadvantages of this method.

Conclusions

This technique of abscess management is effective and easy to perform. It offers potential benefits, such as decreased pain from packing material, no need for packing changes, and decreased need for follow-up visits.

Future research

Key research questions to inform decision makers and future guidelines are:

What is the impact of different types of antibiotics in settings where MRSA is rare (prevalence <10%)?
Do antibiotics have different effects in different populations, such as people who are immunocompromised or in people with recurrent skin abscesses?
What are the long term effects (such as >6 months) of antibiotics on abscess recurrence, Clostridium difficile infection, and MRSA resistance to TMP-SMX or clindamycin?
Is a shorter course of antibiotics (such as 5 days) as effective as a longer course (10 days)?
Is topical therapy (such as iodine, honey, silver, other antimicrobials) effective for treating uncomplicated skin abscesses compared with systemic therapy? Do other adjunctive measures, such as nasal decontamination or antisepsis for the body, reduce the risk that skin abscesses will recur?

Cellulitis treatment—antibiotic selection and duration—states that therapy for typical cases should include an antibiotic active against streptococci; many patients can start oral therapy, and suitable options include penicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, dicloxacillin, cephalexin, or clindamycin. In uncomplicated cellulitis, a 5-day course of antimicrobial therapy is as effective as a 10-day course if clinical improvement has occurred by 5 days; in hospitalized cellulitis/abscess, the average duration was 2 weeks, only about one-third received specific gram-positive therapy, two-thirds received very-broad-spectrum treatment, and the failure rate of 12% was not different regardless of spectrum of treatment.

Background

Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the leading causes of infectious disease, and emergency medicine providers are often the first physicians to encounter patients with untreated or undiagnosed disease.

Case Report

We present the case of a 30-year old man with disseminated TB with multiple musculoskeletal and subcutaneous tubercular abscesses. The diagnosis was suspected in the Emergency Department, but his inpatient treatment was complicated by various social issues. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: This case highlights uncommon examination findings of TB and illustrates the importance of considering this disease when treating patients who present with atypical manifestations of it.

### Superior cluneal nerve block for treatment of buttock abscesses in the emergency department [^6df54ec7]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The buttock is a common location for cutaneous abscesses among patients presenting for emergency department care. Procedural pain management sufficient to permit adequate incision and drainage often requires moderate sedation or general anesthesia.

Discussion

We describe a patient with a buttock abscess who successfully underwent incision and drainage with a regional superior cluneal nerve blockade instead of moderate sedation.

Conclusions

Our experience suggests that superior cluneal nerve blockade may reduce the need for procedural sedation, expedite care, and reduce costs for some patients presenting with buttock abscesses.

Skin and soft tissue infections—culture indications and specimen approach emphasize that for the common forms of SSTIs, cultures are not indicated for uncomplicated infections (cellulitis, subcutaneous abscesses) treated in the outpatient setting, and whether lesion or tissue cultures are beneficial in managing cellulitis in the hospitalized patient is uncertain and the sensitivity of blood cultures in this setting is low; cultures are indicated for the patient who requires operative incision and drainage because of risk for deep structure and underlying tissue involvement. In this section, cutaneous infections, involving skin and soft tissue, have been expanded and categorized as follows: trauma-associated, surgical site, burn wound, fungal, viral, human and animal bites, and device-related, and although S. aureus, especially MRSA, and S. pyogenes are the causative agents in the majority of these infections, other microorganisms, including fungi and viruses, are important and require appropriate medical and therapeutic management. At minimum, a Gram stain should be performed to assess and characterize indicators of surface contamination or infection combined with a description of morphotypes.

Nocardia—cutaneous infection management in immunocompromised hosts: Cutaneous Nocardia infections usually represent metastatic foci from a primary pulmonary source, and the dermatologic manifestations are usually limited to subcutaneous nodules or abscesses and panniculitis. Sulfamethoxazole–trimethoprim (SMX‑TMP) remains the treatment of choice, with alternatives including other sulfa antibiotics (sulfadiazine and sulfisoxazole), amikacin, imipenem, meropenem, third‑generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone and cefotaxime), minocycline, extended‑spectrum fluoroquinolones (e.g., moxifloxacin), linezolid, and dapsone. Combination therapy with other agents should be considered in patients with severe infections or profound and lasting immunodeficiency. Prolonged therapy is important, and the duration of treatment (6–24 months) should take into account disseminated disease and the extent of underlying immunosuppression. Surgical debridement is recommended for necrotic nodules or large subcutaneous abscesses.

### Unexpected findings on point-of-care superficial ultrasound imaging before incision and drainage [^b1587756]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Cutaneous abscesses are typically incised and drained on the basis of clinical assessment. In most cases this procedure is a safe practice. We report 6 cases in which point-of-care ultrasound interrogation of obvious abscesses revealed potential serious complications with planned incision and drainage. Management was altered in 5 of 6 cases, and potential vascular disasters were avoided. In 1 case, the ultrasound results were ignored, and incision and drainage was completed, confirming the suspected abscess was indeed a solid mass later diagnosed as a carcinoma. In this case series, point-of-care ultrasound interrogation provided rapid assessment and discovery of potentially catastrophic anatomic relationships, avoiding serious complications.

### Hidradenitis suppurativa: diagnosis and management in the emergency department [^c738c62c]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease characterized by abscesses and inflammatory nodules, and occasionally tunnels and scars, in the axillae, groin, and inframammary areas.

Objective

HS can be challenging to diagnose because it mimics localized soft-tissue infection. The process of differentiating HS from soft-tissue infection is discussed. Patients with HS frequently visit emergency departments (EDs) for acute management of pain and drainage from HS lesions. This review updates emergency and urgent care physicians on how to educate and initiate treatment for patients with HS, and to coordinate care with dermatologists and other physicians early in their disease course.

Discussion

Recent updates on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of HS are reviewed.

Conclusions

Practice variations between how care for HS is provided in the ED setting and what HS treatment guidelines recommend are identified.

### Skin and soft tissue infections [^30683ba8]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Skin and soft tissue infections result from microbial invasion of the skin and its supporting structures. Management is determined by the severity and location of the infection and by patient comorbidities. Infections can be classified as simple (uncomplicated) or complicated (necrotizing or nonnecrotizing), or as suppurative or nonsuppurative. Most community-acquired infections are caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and beta-hemolytic streptococcus. Simple infections are usually monomicrobial and present with localized clinical findings. In contrast, complicated infections can be mono- or polymicrobial and may present with systemic inflammatory response syndrome. The diagnosis is based on clinical evaluation. Laboratory testing may be required to confirm an uncertain diagnosis, evaluate for deep infections or sepsis, determine the need for inpatient care, and evaluate and treat comorbidities. Initial antimicrobial choice is empiric, and in simple infections should cover Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species. Patients with complicated infections, including suspected necrotizing fasciitis and gangrene, require empiric polymicrobial antibiotic coverage, inpatient treatment, and surgical consultation for debridement. Superficial and small abscesses respond well to drainage and seldom require antibiotics. Immunocompromised patients require early treatment and antimicrobial coverage for possible atypical organisms.

Cellular immunodeficiency—assessment and initial management of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) should include the following: “Consider immediate consultation with a dermatologist familiar with cutaneous manifestations of infection in patients with cellular immune defects” (weak, low); “Consider biopsy and surgical debridement early in the management of these patients” (weak, low); “Empiric antibiotics, antifungals, and/or antivirals should be considered in life-threatening situations” (weak, moderate), and “The use of specific agents should be decided with the input of the primary team, dermatology, infectious disease, and other consulting teams” (strong, moderate). The evidence summary notes these patients are predisposed to infection, may not have systemic manifestations, and that clinicians “should have a very low threshold to obtain a skin biopsy.”

### What is the utility of point-of-care ultrasound for diagnosis of soft tissue abscess vs. cellulitis? [^996f4ab4]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) including cellulitis and abscess are common conditions managed in the emergency department, but differentiating these on history and physical examination alone can be challenging. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has been proposed as a tool to distinguish abscess from cellulitis.

Clinical Question

What is the utility of POCUS for diagnosing soft tissue abscess vs. cellulitis?

Evidence Review

Studies retrieved included four systematic reviews and meta-analyses evaluating the use of POCUS for diagnosing abscess. These studies provide estimates of the potential utility of POCUS in differentiating abscess and cellulitis.

Conclusion

Based upon the available literature, POCUS can reliably differentiate abscess and cellulitis and assist with management of SSTIs.

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: a clinical practice guideline [^05142f78]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Understanding the recommendation

Absolute benefits and harms

The infographic provides an overview of the recommendations and the absolute benefits and harms of different antibiotics. Estimates of the baseline risk for side effects are derived from the control groups of the trials in the systematic review. Detailed information can also be viewed through MAGICapp, including consultation decision aids designed to support shared decision making with patients.

This clinical practice guideline is applicable to patients with uncomplicated skin abscesses, which means that it is not applicable to patients with evidence of systemic illness (such as sepsis), deep tissue infections, superficial infections (such as pustules and papules), hidradenitis suppurativa, or immunocompromising conditions, and patients who do not undergo incision and drainage.

The first recommendation relates to the usefulness of adjuvant TMP-SMX or clindamycin compared with no antibiotics in addition to incision and drainage. The effects of other antibiotics are speculative, except for cephalosporins, which are probably less effective or not effective (see evidence summary for recommendation No 2). Compared with no antibiotics, TMP-SMX or clindamycin reduces the absolute risk of treatment failure by approximately 5% at one month (high quality evidence). In patients who were cured, these antibiotics reduced the absolute risk of recurrence at three months by approximately 8% (high quality evidence). When considering both treatment failure and abscess recurrence, antibiotic therapy thus provides an approximate 13% reduction (high quality evidence). TMP-SMX or clindamycin probably provides a modest reduction in pain (tenderness) during treatment (7% fewer), and a small reduction in hospitalisation (2% fewer) and in similar infections among household contacts (2% fewer) (all moderate quality evidence). Considering the characteristics of involved patients and medical conditions may differ between emergency departments and general practices, antibiotics may confer an even smaller benefit in patients who present to their GP. Antibiotics probably do not reduce the risk of serious or invasive infections or death (moderate quality evidence).

The following constitutes key background information on skin abscess: 
- Definition: A skin abscess is a localized collection of pus within the dermis and deeper skin tissues, typically caused by bacterial infection.
- Pathophysiology: The pathophysiology involves the invasion of bacteria into the skin, often through a break in the skin barrier. The body's immune response to this invasion leads to inflammation and the formation of pus, which is a collection of dead WBCs, bacteria, and tissue debris.
- Epidemiology: The incidence of skin abscess worldwide is estimated at 1861.45 per 100,000 person-years.
- Risk factors: Risk factors for skin abscesses include poor hygiene, trauma to the skin, and underlying medical conditions that compromise the immune system, such as diabetes or HIV infection. Other local factors, such as the presence of foreign materials or conditions like hidradenitis suppurativa and pilonidal cyst, can also contribute to the development of skin abscesses.
- Disease course: Clinically, skin abscesses typically present as a painful, red, swollen area on the skin. There may also be a visible accumulation of pus. In some cases, systemic signs of infection such as fever may be present.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: The prognosis for skin abscesses is generally good with appropriate treatment, which typically involves incision and drainage, and in some cases, antibiotic therapy.

Superficial infections

Superficial infections encompass either superficial spreading infection and inflammation within the epidermis and dermis that may be treated with antibiotics alone or a well circumscribed abscess that may be treated by drainage alone.

Physical examination usually reveals erythema, tenderness, and induration. The majority of superficial skin and soft tissue infections are caused by gram positive bacteria, particularly streptococci and S. aureus. Three common presentations consist of impetigo, erysipelas, and cellulitis. They are managed by antimicrobial therapy against Gram-positive bacteria.

Impetigo is a skin infection that is common throughout the world. It is characterized by discrete purulent lesions nearly always caused by β-haemolytic streptococci and/or S. aureus.

Erysipelas is a fiery red, tender, painful plaque with well-demarcated edges and is commonly caused by streptococcal species, usually S. pyogenes. S. aureus rarely causes erysipelas.

Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the dermis and the subcutaneous tissue that most commonly affects the lower extremities, although it can affect other areas. It causes local signs of inflammation, such as warmth, erythema, pain, lymphangitis, and frequently systemic upset with fever and raised white blood cell count.

For a simple superficial abscess or boil, incision and drainage is the primary treatment, and antibiotics are not needed. To be considered a simple abscess, induration and erythema should be limited only to a defined area of the abscess and should not extend beyond its borders. Additionally, simple abscesses should not have extension into deeper tissues or multiloculated extension.

Clinical, laboratory, and radiological evaluation in febrile neutropenia with skin and soft tissue lesions—key diagnostic steps are specified. Signs and symptoms are often diminished or absent in neutropenia, and skin lesions, no matter how small or innocuous in appearance, should be carefully evaluated. Early involvement of an infectious diseases specialist, a surgeon, and a dermatologist may result in improved outcome. Initial clinical impressions should be supplemented with a systemic approach to enhance diagnosis and management. Blood cultures are critical, and at least 2 sets should be obtained. Radiographic imaging should be performed as clinically indicated and can help define extent of disease; chest/sinus imaging may identify silent pulmonary or sinus infection with dissemination. The most specific method is biopsy or aspiration of lesions for histological, cytological, and microbiological evaluation.

### A case of extracutaneous pyoderma gangrenosum in a patient with persistent cutaneous and systemic symptoms: implications for differential diagnosis and treatment [^f4799ca4]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

As PG with systemic involvement is a diagnosis of exclusion, patients typically undergo extensive medical and infectious workup. They may experience critical delays in diagnosis and inappropriate management. While it is essential to rule out infection, vasculitis, and malignancy, extracutaneous PG should be included in the differential for patients presenting with flares of cutaneous PG and concomitant systemic symptoms.

While neutrophilic dermatoses can be part of the spectrum of autoinflammatory diseases, our patient did not have features of defined syndromes.A diagnosis of extracutaneous PG, PAPA (pyogenic arthritis, PG, and acne), PAPASH (pyogenic arthritis, acne, PG, and suppurative hidradenitis), and aseptic abscess syndrome rely on the patterns of presentation, associated signs and symptoms, and genetic testing.Our patient lacked acne and hidradenitis suppurativa, as well as any joint pain during these episodes. Antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody, and antiphospholipid antibody tests have been negative to date. Her rheumatoid factor and anticitrullinated peptide antibody have normalized with immunosuppressive treatment. Microscopically, lung tissue has consistently shown numerous neutrophils and negative infectious stains and tissue cultures, which can be seen in both extracutaneous PG and aseptic abscess syndrome. However, the patient's history of cutaneous PG flares in parallel with the extracutaneous lesions suggests extracutaneous PG as the most likely diagnosis. As we regard extracutaneous PG to reside within the spectrum of autoinflammatory disease, the distinction is not likely to affect management. The more important management issue is correct identification as inflammatory rather than infectious disease.

### Primary closure of cutaneous abscesses: a systematic review [^9071fad3]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Cutaneous abscesses have traditionally been treated with incision and drainage followed by secondary healing. Primary closure after incision and drainage is an alternative mode of therapy practiced in some parts of the world. The current study reviews the experience with primary closure of abscesses.

Methods

A systematic literature review was conducted using search terms abscess and primary closure. The databases searched included MEDLINE, PubMED, EMBASE, CINHAL, and the Cochrane Library between 1950 and 2009. The reference lists of the retrieved studies were also manually searched for additional studies. We performed a meta-analysis of all randomized clinical trials in which patients were randomized to either primary or secondary closure of incised and drained abscesses using Review Manager software.

Results

Of 33 articles retrieved, there were 7 randomized controlled trials in which 915 patients were randomized to primary (n = 455) or secondary (n = 460) closure. Many abscesses were located in the anogenital region and drained by surgeons. The time to healing after primary closure (7.8 days [95% confidence interval {CI}, 7.3-8.3]) was significantly shorter than that after secondary closure (15.0 days [95% CI, 14.3-15.7]; absolute difference, 7.3 days [95% CI, 6.9-7.6]). The rates of abscess recurrence after primary closure (7.6% [95% CI, 4.6-10.6]) were similar to those after secondary closure (11.1 days [95% CI, 7.5-14.7]; odds ratio, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.35-1.15]).

Conclusions

Studies from 4 countries suggest that primary closure of incised and drained abscesses results in faster healing and similar low abscess recurrence rates than after secondary closure. These studies provide a foundation for which clinical trials can be conducted in the United States.

Therapy for community-acquired MRSA should be added for patients at risk for CA-MRSA and subsequently for patients who do not respond to beta-lactam therapy within 48 to 72 hours or who have chills, fever, a new abscess, increasing erythema, or uncontrolled pain.

Although in cellulitis, swabs and aspirates of the leading edge of the site of infection have a low yield of around 10%, when it is possible, antibiotic treatment should be modified, on the basis of antimicrobial susceptibilities of organisms obtained.

Simple abscesses

7) Incision and drainage is the primary treatment for a simple abscesses or boils. Antibiotics are not needed (Recommendation 1 C).

For a simple superficial abscess or boil, incision and drainage is the primary treatment, and antibiotics are not needed. Simple abscesses should not have extension into deeper tissues or multiloculated extension.

Complex abscesses

8) Complex skin and subcutaneous abscesses are typically well circumscribed and respond to incision and drainage. Antimicrobial therapy is required if systemic signs of sepsis are present, in immunocompromised patients, if source control is incomplete or for the abscesses with significant cellulitis (Recommendation 1 C).

9) Empiric antibiotic therapy should be directed toward the likely pathogens involved.

Therapy for community-acquired MRSA should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA (Recommendation 1 C).

10) Inadequate resolution should prompt consideration of further drainage, resistant pathogens, or host immune failure (Recommendation 1 C).

The cornerstone of treatment is early surgical drainage. Antimicrobial therapy is required if systemic signs of sepsis are present, in immunocompromised patients, if source control is incomplete or for the abscesses with significant cellulitis.

Complicated abscesses may involve a variety of pathogens. Aerobic gram-positive pathogens are isolated in most complicated abscesses. They may involve only a single pathogen but are frequently poly-microbial in origin and may involve a number of organisms.

Empiric antibiotic therapy should be directed toward the likely pathogens involved. Broad-spectrum agents with coverage of gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic pathogens may be required depending on the clinical setting. Given the high frequency of MRSA, this pathogen should be empirically covered if it is suspected, but no randomized studies are available for the treatment of SSTI specifically caused by CA-MRSA.

### Alternative strategy for the diagnosis of an enterocutaneous fistula in a resource-limited setting [^be8e8d3c]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

What we did and why?

D. Plain film showing contrast on a gauze placed at the orifice of the wound after oral ingestion of contrast.

Enterocutaneous fistula was suspected in this case based on the patient’s presenting symptoms. However, limited radiographic capabilities and personnel would delay definitive diagnosis beyond what was deemed acceptable by the primary team. As such, we have developed a technique wherein the patient ingests 20 mL of water-soluble contrast medium such as gastrograffin diluted in 500 mL of water over a period of 30 min. A 4×4 gauze is placed over the cutaneous opening. After 6 hours, the gauze is removed, and a plain X-ray is performed of only the gauze. If radio-opaque, as in this case (figure 1), the diagnosis of ECF is confirmed and appropriate management is initiated. If the diagnosis is not confirmed but clinical suspicion remains high, further, more time-consuming studies can be pursued.

Figure 1 
A 4×4 gauze which was placed over the cutaneous opening of a suspected enterocutaneous fistula appears radio-opaque on X-ray, confirming the diagnosis of an enterocutaneous fistula.

Although clinical data can offer clues to the diagnosis based on the patient’s history and the quality and quantity of the effluent on physical examination, radiologic confirmation of the diagnosis is often necessary.A fistulogram, which is often the first study ordered in these cases, is performed injecting contrast into the cutaneous opening using a pediatric feeding tube, angiocatheter, or nasogastric tube, followed by a spot radiograph or fluoroscopic examination. Although overall a safe procedure, injuries to the small bowel and pseudocyst rupture have been reported. Small bowel follow-through is the gold standard for patients with complicated intraluminal pathologies such as Crohn’s disease. This procedure, however, can be particularly onerous for the patient, requiring the ingestion of 500–600 mL of contrast and several hours with repeated radiographs. More complex presentations may require CT scan or MRI for characterization of abscess, obstruction, inflammation, or other non-contiguous lesions that prevent a fistula from healing.

13) In unstable patients, ultrasound may be useful to differentiate simple cellulitis from necrotizing fasciitis (Recommendation 2 C).

Management of patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections

14) Patients with severe sepsis or septic shock caused by NSTI require early source control, antimicrobial therapy, and supportive treatment (Recommendation 1 C).

Source control in patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections

15) Surgical source control must be early and aggressive to halt progression of the inflammatory process caused by NSTI (Recommendation 1 C).

Hyperbaric oxygen in patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections

16) Although the benefit of adjuvant hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy remains controversial, it may be considered where it is available (Recommendation 2 C).

SSTIs may be also classified according to the anatomical tissue layers involved. Superficial infections such as erysipelas, impetigo, folliculitis, furuncles, and carbuncles are located at the epidermal and dermal layer, while cellulitis is located in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Deep infections extend below the dermis and may involve the subcutaneous tissue, fascial planes, or muscular compartments presenting as complex abscesses, fasciitis, or myonecrosis.

Complicated SSTIs may also be classified as non-necrotizing or necrotizing infections. Necrotizing infections most commonly involve the muscular fascial layers but may also involve the dermal, subcutaneous, and muscle layers and warrant prompt, aggressive surgical debridement.

In 2014, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) updated practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft-tissue infections. The guidelines divided infections by purulent and non-purulent, severity (mild, moderate, and severe), and tissue necrosis (necrotizing versus non-necrotizing).

Recently, the US FDA has introduced the new definition of acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infection (ABSSSI) to more closely define complicated soft-tissue infection for the purposes of registration trials. ABSSSIs include cellulitis/erysipelas, wound infections, and major cutaneous abscesses. Thus, an ABSSSI is defined as a bacterial infection of the skin with a lesion size area of ≥ 75 cm 2 (lesion size measured by the area of redness, edema, or induration).

In 2015, the WSES published its guidelines for management of SSTIs proposing a new definition dividing SSTIs in three main groups: surgical site infections (SSIs), non-necrotizing SSTIs, and necrotizing SSTIs. SSIs are classified into two subgroups: incisional and organ and organ/space. The incisional SSIs are further divided into superficial (skin and subcutaneous tissue) and deep (deep soft-tissue muscle and fascia). Organ and organ/space infections are not truly soft-tissue infections. Non-necrotizing SSTIs including erysipelas, impetigo, folliculitis, simple abscess, and complex abscess may be treated by antibiotics or drainage alone.

Strength of recommendation and quality of evidence—The grading framework includes categories such as “Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence” where “Desirable effects clearly outweigh undesirable effects, or vice versa” and “Consistent evidence from well-performed RCTs or exceptionally strong evidence from unbiased observational studies,” with the implication that “Recommendation can apply to most patients in most circumstances. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.” For “Weak recommendation, high-quality evidence,” “Desirable effects closely balanced with undesirable effects” and the same high-quality evidence standard apply, with the implication that “The best action may differ depending on circumstances or patient’s or societal values. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.” Lower-quality tiers are also detailed, including “Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence,” where “Recommendation may change when higher-quality evidence becomes available,” and “Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence,” where “Other alternatives may be equally reasonable” and “Any estimate of effect, for at least 1 critical outcome, is very uncertain.”

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^7be6f8f2]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Classification

Several systems of classification have been used to describe SSTIs. In 1998 The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classified SSTIs into two broad categories - uncomplicated and complicated - for the purpose of clinical trials evaluating new antimicrobials for the treatment of SSTIs. Uncomplicated SSTIs included superficial infections such as cellulitis, simple abscesses, impetigo, and furuncles that either require antibiotics alone or in conjunction with surgical incision for drainage of abscess. In contrast, complicated SSTIs involve the deep soft tissues and require significant surgical intervention.

The terms “complicated” and “uncomplicated” skin structure infections is still valid and can be useful in describing SSTIs.

Uncomplicated SSTIs are at low risk for life- or limb-threatening infection unless they are not properly treated. Patients who have uncomplicated SSTIs can be treated with either empiric antibiotic therapy according to likely pathogen and local resistance patterns or simple surgical drainage.

The practice guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections classifies SSTIs into five categories: 1) superficial uncomplicated infection (includes impetigo, erysipelas and cellulitis), 2) necrotizing infections, 3) infections associated with bites and animal contact, 4) surgical site infections and 5) infections in the immunocompromised host.

Eron et al. classified SSTIs according to the severity of local and systemic signs and the presence or absence of comorbid conditions for patients presenting as out-patients to guide the clinical management, treatment, and admission decisions for patients with SSTIs. This system is organized into classes of infection:

Class 1: patients with SSTI, but no signs or symptoms of systemic toxicity or co-morbidities.

IDSA 2014 SSTI guideline—purulent skin and soft tissue infections (abscesses, furuncles, carbuncles, inflamed epidermoid cysts) recommendations are as follows: Gram stain and culture of pus from carbuncles and abscesses are recommended, but treatment without these studies is reasonable in typical cases (strong, moderate). Gram stain and culture of pus from inflamed epidermoid cysts are not recommended (strong, moderate). Incision and drainage is the recommended treatment for inflamed epidermoid cysts, carbuncles, abscesses, and large furuncles (strong, high). The decision to administer antibiotics directed against S. aureus as an adjunct to incision and drainage should be based on systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria such as temperature ≥38°C or <36°C, tachypnea >24 breaths per minute, tachycardia >90 beats per minute, or white blood cell count >12 000 or <4000 cells/µL (moderate; Figure 1) (strong, low), and an antibiotic active against MRSA is recommended for patients with carbuncles or abscesses who have markedly impaired host defenses and in patients with SIRS (Figure 1, Table 2) (strong, low).

Cryptococcal meningitis immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)—frequency, features, and management: An estimated 30% of HIV-infected patients with cryptococcal meningitis experience IRIS after initiation or reinitiation of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). Patients with cryptococcal IRIS are more likely to be antiretroviral naive, have higher HIV RNA levels, and have less cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammation at presentation; risk may be decreased when CSF cultures are negative at ART initiation. Cryptococcal IRIS presents with worsening clinical disease despite microbiological evidence of effective antifungal therapy, whereas treatment failure has continued positive cultures. The appropriate management strategy for IRIS is to continue both ART and antifungal therapy and reduce elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), if present (AII); some specialists recommend a brief course of glucocorticosteroids for severe symptoms (CIII). With non-meningeal cryptococcosis, IRIS risk appears lower and may present as lymphadenitis, cutaneous abscesses, or bony lesions; management is similar, including continuing ART, initiating or continuing antifungal therapy (AIII), and considering glucocorticoids (CIII).

Strains of community-acquired Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) have emerged as an important group of pathogens. Most infections present as cutaneous abscess and most of these may respond to drainage alone. Sulfonamide and tetracycline antibiotics remain valuable agents for most CA-MRSA infections, but inducible resistance to clindamycin is problematic in some areas. Linezolid, and the newer parenteral antibiotics should be reserved for serious infections.

### Periclitoral abscess: a recurrent problem [^325da8c4]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Periclitoral abscesses are rare and lack a defined management strategy due to the limited number of cases available for review. Regardless of the initial management, recurrence remains common.

Case

A 17-year-old presented with clitoral pain and swelling consistent with periclitoral abscess. Conservative treatment with antibiotics failed, and underwent 2 incision and drainage procedures prior to resolution of the abscess.

Summary and Conclusion

Spontaneous periclitoral abscess is rare, and the optimal treatment strategy has not been defined, with a high rate of recurrence being noted regardless of either conservative management with antibiotics or incision and drainage as initial treatment. In many cases of recurrent periclitoral abscess, hair was removed from the abscess cavity, suggesting that retained foreign material in the abscess cavity could be the nidus for recurrence.

### Rapidly progressive soft tissue infections [^76cd07f8]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2005). Medium credibility.

Skin and soft tissue infections are among the most common reasons for people to seek medical advice. They also represent one of the most common indications for antimicrobial therapy and account for approximately 7-10% of hospitalisations in North America. Although non-limb and non-life threatening infections may be treated on an out-patient basis with oral antibiotics, patients with more serious acute skin and soft tissue infections may require admission to hospital for management; this decision is especially true if the infection is rapidly progressive. We provide a concise overview of the differential diagnosis and approach to management of community-acquired rapidly progressive skin and soft tissue infections.

### Current treatment options for acute skin and skin-structure infections [^4e41d0f3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections (ABSSSIs) are commonly encountered infections in various healthcare settings. Over the last 2 decades, community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has emerged as the most common cause of purulent skin infections in the United States with accompanying higher rates of complications (eg, abscess), recurrence, and treatment failures, often leading to hospitalization. The overall burden of managing such common infections has resulted in added healthcare costs.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) definition of ABSSSI includes cellulitis/erysipelas, major skin abscesses, and wound infections, with all requiring a minimum lesion surface area of 75 cm 2 (Table 1). ABSSSI is a common reason for patients seeking care in various healthcare settings, including emergency departments. Most are treated effectively as outpatients. The decision-making process for admitting patients to the hospital for ABSSSI is complex and often very subjective. In general, patients with all of the following characteristics can be managed as outpatients: no signs of sepsis, low suspicion of deep soft tissue infection including necrotizing fasciitis, and lack of exacerbation of comorbidities. For the majority of patients, empiric treatment is most often directed against gram-positive cocci.

Table 1. 
US Food and Drug Administration Definition of Acute Bacterial Skin and Structure Infection

During hospitalization, healthcare providers may need to reevaluate antimicrobial treatment and the need for surgical intervention. Antimicrobial therapy may need to be adjusted, particularly in the elderly due to comorbidities such as renal insufficiency. Once culture and susceptibility results are available, if indicated, deescalation of antimicrobial therapy is recommended. Of note, the role of MRSA in cellulitis without a wound or purulence is not as clear due to the absence of culturable material.

Here, I review ABSSSI treatment guidelines in the hospital setting and discuss current and future antibiotic options for treatment of this commonly encountered infection. Although many of the studies discussed here have used different terms to describe these infections, such as complicated skin and skin-structure infections or complicated skin and soft-tissue infections, throughout the article I will refer to them as ABSSSI.

### Primary care management of skin abscesses guided by ultrasound [^da21d1a1]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Primary care providers often manage skin abscesses in the outpatient setting. Estimating the size and depth of an abscess, and distinguishing abscess from cellulitis by clinical examination can be challenging due to surrounding firm tissue induration. Definitive treatment of abscess requires incision and drainage, and the approach chosen may be altered by abscess size, depth, and surrounding neurovascular structures.

Methods

For 31 consecutive patients seen in the primary care outpatient clinic, we prospectively compared the estimated size of skin abscesses by clinical examination with that determined by ultrasound. Prior to incision and drainage, a limited point-of-care ultrasound examination was performed and the abscess dimensions were measured, the depth was determined, and adjacent vascular structures were noted. Based on ultrasound findings, physicians reported whether the decision to perform the procedure or the techniques used to perform the procedure were altered by the scan.

Results

The clinical examination was inaccurate for size estimation by >0.5 cm in 16 of 31 patients (52%). Ultrasound examination changed the physician decision of whether or not incision and drainage should be performed in 7 patients (23%) and altered the technique/approach in an additional 10 patients (32%); thus, management was changed in 55% of cases. Physician confidence in performing the procedure was improved in 16 cases (52%).

Conclusion

Outpatient procedural management of skin abscesses by primary care physicians was altered in more than half the cases by performing point-of-care ultrasound prior to incision and drainage.

Cellulitis without abscess, ulcer, or purulent drainage—empiric antibiotic selection and MRSA coverage is outlined as follows: treatment with β-lactams, such as cefazolin or oxacillin, was successful in 96% of patients, suggesting MRSA-directed therapy is usually unnecessary; however, MRSA coverage may be prudent with penetrating trauma, illicit drug use, purulent drainage, or concurrent MRSA elsewhere. Options for MRSA include intravenous vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, or telavancin, or oral doxycycline, clindamycin, or SMX-TMP; if oral coverage for both streptococci and MRSA is desired, use clindamycin alone or combine SMX-TMP or doxycycline with a β-lactam (eg, penicillin, cephalosporin, or amoxicillin). The activity of doxycycline and SMX-TMP against β-hemolytic streptococci is not known, and in the absence of abscess, ulcer, or purulent drainage, β-lactam monotherapy is recommended; a double-blind study showed SMX-TMP plus cephalexin was no more efficacious than cephalexin alone in pure cellulitis.

Classifications

Various classification systems have been used to describe SSTIs, including variables such as anatomic location, causative pathogen(s), rate of progression, depth of infection, and severity of clinical presentation.

In 1998, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classified SSTIs into two broad categories for clinical trials evaluating new antimicrobials for their treatment: uncomplicated and complicated. Uncomplicated SSTIs included superficial infections such as cellulitis, simple abscesses, impetigo, and furuncles and required antibiotics or surgical incision to drain abscess alone. In contrast, complicated SSTIs included deep soft-tissue infections such as necrotizing infections, infected ulcers, infected burns, and major abscesses, requiring significant surgical intervention with drainage and debridement.

In 2003, Eron et al. classified SSTIs according to the severity of local and systemic signs and the presence or absence of comorbid conditions in patients presenting in the outpatient setting to guide the clinical management, treatment, and admission decisions. In this classification system, SSTIs were divided in four classes:
Class 1 patients with SSTI, but no signs or symptoms of systemic toxicity or co-morbidities.
Class 2 patients are either systemically unwell with stable co-morbidities or systemically well, but with comorbidity (e.g. diabetes, obesity) that may complicate or delay resolution.
Class 3 patients appear toxic and unwell (fever, tachycardia, tachypnoea, and/or hypotension).
Class 4 patients have sepsis syndrome and life-threatening infection; for example, necrotizing fasciitis.

SSTIs may be classified according to the anatomical tissue layers involved. Superficial infections such as erysipelas, impetigo, folliculitis, furuncles, and carbuncles are located at the epidermal and dermal layers, while cellulitis is located in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Deep infections extend below the subcutaneous tissue may involve fascial planes, or muscular compartments presenting as complex abscesses, fasciitis, or myonecrosis. SSTIs may also be classified as non-necrotizing or necrotizing infections.

In 2014, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) updated practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft-tissue infections. The guidelines divided infections by purulent and non-purulent, severity (mild, moderate, and severe), and tissue necrosis (necrotizing versus non-necrotizing).

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: a clinical practice guideline [^89221378]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

What you need to know

For uncomplicated skin abscesses, we suggest using trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or clindamycin in addition to incision and drainage rather than incision and drainage alone, and emphasise the need for shared decision making
TMP-SMX or clindamycin modestly reduces pain and treatment failure and probably reduces abscess recurrence, but increases the risk of adverse effects including nausea and diarrhoea
We suggest TMP-SMX rather than clindamycin because TMP-SMX has a lower risk of diarrhoea
Cephalosporins in addition to incision and drainage are probably not more effective than incision and drainage alone in most settings
From a societal perspective, the modest benefits from adjuvant antibiotics may not outweigh the harms from increased antimicrobial resistance in the community, although this is speculative

### Diagnosis and management of hidradenitis suppurativa: a review for the emergency clinician [^6bce15e6]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a complex, chronic skin disease characterised by painful inflammatory nodules, abscesses, dermal tunnels, sinus tracts and fistulae with a predilection for intertriginous skin. HS carries a substantial disease burden due to its prevalence, associated comorbidities and quality of life impacts and is associated with high healthcare resource utilisation. Clarity regarding the prevalence and pathogenesis of HS has led to improved therapies and more patients seeking care in both outpatient and acute care settings, including the emergency department. Emergency medicine providers play a critical role in HS diagnosis, management of acute flares and connection of HS patients with long-term dermatologic care, which can in turn help manage utilisation of acute care resources.

### Cutaneous community-acquired and hospital-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^e703c788]. Dermatologic Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

The clinical presentation of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection ranges from asymptomatic colonization to cutaneous and invasive involvement. This review discusses the cutaneous presentations of community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) and hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) that one may encounter in the hospital or outpatient setting. Cutaneous CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA are often clinically indistinguishable, although they have different epidemiologic profiles and virulence factors. Bacterial culture is necessary for diagnosis and guides treatment, as infection with CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA require distinct clinical management. Guidelines for surgical interventions and antibiotic treatment of CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA will be discussed. Strategies for MRSA decolonization and prevention of further spread will also be reviewed.

### 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guideline for the treatment of coccidioidomycosis [^3b295682]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Coccidioidomycosis—hematogenous dissemination recognition focuses on lesion characteristics and typical presentations. Although patients with cellular immune deficiencies are especially susceptible, most patients with coccidioidal lesions outside of the lungs have no identified immune deficiencies. Extrapulmonary lesions are focal areas of tissue destruction that result from the acute inflammatory response engendered by actively rupturing spherules, and pulmonary symptoms or radiographic abnormalities may be minimal or completely absent. Chronic skin ulceration or subcutaneous abscesses are the consequence of cutaneous and soft tissue dissemination, and headache and focal skeletal pain are common with CM or osteomyelitis, respectively. Although such lesions may wax and wane over many months and even years, they usually are progressive and seldom resolve completely without medical intervention, and tissue-destructive lesions are nearly always readily evident from focal signs and symptoms; their absence is strong evidence that disseminated infection is not present.

### Pediatric renal abscesses: a contemporary series [^c63e7a64]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pediatric renal abscesses are an uncommon diagnosis, with a paucity of data comparing treatment modalities. Patient presentation ranges from persistent dull flank/abdominal pain with or without fevers, to those who are overtly ill, presenting with hemodynamic instability and bacteremia. Management for pediatric renal abscesses is typically based on results extrapolated from small series in adult cohorts, with conservative measures recommended when the lesion is <3 cm.

Objective

This study evaluated the presentation, management and outcomes of a contemporary cohort of pediatric patients with renal abscesses.

Study Design

A total of 16 consecutive pediatric patients with radiologically diagnosed intra-renal or peri-nephric abscesses from 1990 to 2012 were identified. Patients were identified by querying institutional records via ICD-9 and CPT codes referencing renal abscess. Charts were retrospectively reviewed to evaluate multiple clinical variables, including: presenting symptoms, size of abscess, management strategy and clinical outcomes. Clinical resolution was confirmed via repeat ultrasound or computed tomography.

Results

The median age at presentation was 13 years (range 1 month-18 years) and 13/16 patients (81%) were female. Abscess formation was secondary to: urinary tract infection in 13 (81%); hematogenous seeding from a skin infection in one (6%); and an unknown etiology in two (12%) patients. The most common organism identified on urine culture was Escherichia coli (10, 77%). Hematogenous seeding was confirmed in only one case, with Staphylococcus aureus growing on culture from both a cutaneous lesion and percutaneous drainage of the renal lesion. Overall, abscesses were a median of 2.2 cm (IQR 2, 3.7), with 13 (81%) successfully managed with conservative therapy, including intravenous antibiotics, with resolution on repeat imaging at a median of 21 days (range 6-55). For patients presenting with abscesses ≤3 cm, conservative measures were employed in 10/11 cases, with 100% success rate. Three patients had larger abscesses (3.8, 4, and 10 cm), which resolved after treatment with percutaneous drainage. A voiding cystourethrogram was performed in 10 patients, with two (20%) detecting an abnormality (low-grade vesicoureteral reflux, which required no further intervention).

Conclusions

Pediatric renal abscesses were most commonly small and secondary to an E. coli UTI. Most small (≤3 cm) renal abscesses resolved with conservative management. Percutaneous drainage should be considered for lesions >3 cm and in patients who remain persistently febrile, despite culture-specific antibiotics, are immunocompromised or critically ill.

### ASRA pain medicine consensus practice infection control guidelines for regional anesthesia and pain medicine [^814313c8]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Neuraxial infections—outcomes and immediate management emphasize that recovery from spinal/epidural abscess depends on the degree and duration of spinal cord compression, the location of the abscess, and whether neurological symptoms exist at presentation, and patients with motor deficits or cauda equina signs and symptoms at presentation tend to have incomplete recovery. Some patients with meningitis make complete recovery, but neurological sequelae are not uncommon, and the risk of mortality following neuraxial block-related meningitis is between 10.3% (for epidural-associated meningitis) and 15.3% (for spinal-associated meningitis). Early detection of a spinal/epidural abscess is critical since neurological recovery depends on the degree and duration of thecal compression and the degree of neurological symptoms at presentation. Catheter use should be discontinued at the earliest signs of infection followed by appropriate early medical/surgical management. For patients with localized skin infection at or near the site, single-injection regional nerve blocks should be decided on a case-by-case basis if necessary, whereas the safety of continuous nerve catheters in such circumstances is not known and their placement cannot be recommended.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^cac1249a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

A panel of national experts was convened by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) to update the 2005 guidelines for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). The panel's recommendations were developed to be concordant with the recently published IDSA guidelines for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. The focus of this guideline is the diagnosis and appropriate treatment of diverse SSTIs ranging from minor superficial infections to life-threatening infections such as necrotizing fasciitis. In addition, because of an increasing number of immunocompromised hosts worldwide, the guideline addresses the wide array of SSTIs that occur in this population. These guidelines emphasize the importance of clinical skills in promptly diagnosing SSTIs, identifying the pathogen, and administering effective treatments in a timely fashion.
