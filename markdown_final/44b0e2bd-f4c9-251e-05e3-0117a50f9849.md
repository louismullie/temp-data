## Question

Management of CKD in peritoneal dialysis patients

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of CKD in peritoneal dialysis patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical frame and scope, including whether we are addressing pre-dialysis CKD versus ESRD on PD. Then, I should verify the overarching principles that guide PD care, especially person-centeredness and shared decision-making. Next, I will examine modality selection and initiation strategies, including urgent-start PD and incremental PD. After that, I need to review core management domains: residual kidney function preservation, volume status and blood pressure, anemia, mineral and bone disorder, nutrition, and infection prevention. I will then consider special populations and complications, and finally synthesize a practical, longitudinal care plan with monitoring and quality metrics, making sure I double-check any numerical targets and correct them if needed against guidelines and high-quality reviews.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. The phrase "CKD in peritoneal dialysis patients" is imprecise; PD is a treatment for ESRD, so the correct focus is on managing ESRD with PD, while also addressing residual kidney function and CKD-related complications that persist after dialysis initiation. I should explicitly distinguish pre-dialysis CKD management from ESRD care on PD to avoid conflating guidance scopes, and I will anchor to contemporary PD practice recommendations and core curricula to structure the plan [^5365f90c] [^a1730a67].

> Next, I should review the overarching principles. Person-centered care and shared decision-making are foundational in PD, emphasizing individualized prescriptions, life participation, and alignment with patient goals. I need to ensure I integrate patient-reported outcomes and experiences into routine care and recognize that many traditional adequacy targets were not designed with frail, older, or multimorbid patients in mind, which necessitates a goal-directed approach rather than a one-size-fits-all prescription [^5365f90c] [^6102eebf] [^c0b7812c].

> I will now examine modality selection and initiation. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about urgent-start PD; I should verify the balance of benefits and risks. Urgent-start PD is feasible and can expand access, but it increases dialysate leak risk compared with conventional-start PD, while peritonitis and mortality signals are uncertain and generally low certainty. Therefore, programs need protocols, trained teams, and careful patient selection to mitigate mechanical complications [^179e2232] [^1705a4f1]. Incremental PD leverages residual kidney function and can reduce treatment burden; I should confirm that evidence for hard outcomes is limited and counsel patients accordingly, with close monitoring for uremic symptoms and fluid overload as RKF declines [^730d77a3] [^5054a8d7].

> Now, residual kidney function preservation. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence. Multiple reviews and guidelines consistently associate RKF with improved survival and quality of life in PD, and PD itself better preserves RKF than thrice-weekly HD. Mechanistically, RKF contributes volume control, phosphate removal, and clearance of middle-molecular and protein-bound toxins, so I should prioritize strategies that protect RKF, including avoiding nephrotoxins, optimizing volume status, and considering ACE inhibitors or ARBs when indicated, while acknowledging that some data are observational [^e213d287] [^e7c50bfc] [^d19d0ecc].

> For volume status and blood pressure, I need to ensure a nuanced approach. PD offers continuous, gentler ultrafiltration that can better preserve hemodynamic stability, but fluid overload remains common and harmful. I should confirm that diuretics remain underutilized in PD with residual urine output and can meaningfully reduce reliance on hypertonic glucose exchanges; salt restriction and careful assessment of peritoneal transport characteristics are essential, and icodextrin can be leveraged for long dwells in high or high-average transporters to improve ultrafiltration and volume control [^a1730a67] [^e3245f47] [^42e3dd4a].

> Anemia management comes next. I should double-check iron deficiency prevalence and ESA requirements in PD. Iron deficiency is common and often functional, and most ESA-treated patients require iron repletion; IV iron is efficient, but oral iron every other day can be reasonable when IV access is limited. KDIGO supports SC ESA administration in PD, and I should individualize targets balancing symptomatic benefit with potential risks, integrating ferritin and transferrin saturation to guide therapy and considering emerging HIF-PHI options where available [^c7baff50] [^efb39491] [^606cba9c].

> Mineral and bone disorder requires proactive control. Hyperphosphatemia is prevalent and independently associated with adverse outcomes; I should confirm that dietary phosphate restriction to about 800–1000 mg/day is advised while maintaining protein intake, and that phosphate binders are often necessary. Lanthanum carbonate has RCT-level data in PD subgroups, and I need to monitor for gastrointestinal side effects and drug interactions, adjusting the binder choice to patient comorbidity and pill burden [^6382fd53].

> Nutrition is a critical domain in PD. Protein losses across the peritoneal membrane average about 8–10 g/day and increase with peritonitis, so I should target protein intake around 1.2 g/kg/day and consider amino acid–based dialysate supplementation in selected malnourished patients, recognizing that long-term hard outcomes data are limited and cost and acid load must be weighed. I should also screen for and treat PEW and inflammation, as hypoalbuminemia independently predicts mortality in PD cohorts [^061b1dac] [^7ba3bcde] [^50a7dd14].

> Infection prevention is non-negotiable. I need to ensure rigorous training, aseptic technique, and prophylactic exit-site care; peritonitis remains the Achilles' heel of PD, with substantial morbidity and a lingering mortality signal for months after an episode. I should confirm that about half of peritonitis cases require hospitalization and that catheter removal is indicated for refractory cases or fungal peritonitis, and I must maintain a low threshold to involve surgery for access issues to avoid technique failure [^8a5a8873] [^c3871947] [^63534516].

> Special populations require tailored prescriptions. In diabetes, glucose absorption from dialysate complicates glycemic control; I should consider icodextrin for long dwells, coordinate with endocrinology, and monitor for hyperglycemia and insulin needs. In ADPKD, massive kidney or liver enlargement can limit fill volumes and increase intraperitoneal pressure, so I should individualize dwell volumes and consider PD as a viable option when anatomy permits. In frailty, I should pivot toward palliative PD or conservative care when burdens outweigh benefits, using shared decision-making to align treatment intensity with goals [^6e5d0d27] [^4fa33668] [^c0b7812c].

> I should also review complications and transitions. Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis risk rises with PD vintage, but elective modality switching solely to prevent EPS is not supported; instead, I should monitor for early signs and manage proactively. Technique failure and transfers to HD are common, so I need a backup plan and early discussion of transitions, and I should remember that PD can often be resumed within 48 hours after many surgeries with small-volume supine exchanges to minimize leaks and hernias [^44089c58] [^8a5a8873].

> Next, I should synthesize a longitudinal care plan. Pre-dialysis education should start at CKD stage 4, with unbiased counseling on PD, HD, transplant, and conservative care, and early nephrology referral improves access to PD and reduces early mortality. Once on PD, I will reassess every 1–3 months for symptoms, volume status, RKF, clearance, nutrition, and infection risk, adjusting the prescription incrementally. I will incorporate PROMs annually and consider telehealth to support home-based care and training, especially in rural or resource-limited settings [^3ca84bda] [^5571413c] [^39140c06].

> But wait, what about adequacy targets? I initially thought to anchor a weekly Kt/V urea target of 1.7 as standard, but hold on, I should verify the current stance. Contemporary guidance de-emphasizes rigid Kt/V targets and instead supports goal-directed PD with clinical monitoring for uremic symptoms, fluid overload, and protein-energy wasting; while a weekly total Kt/V around 1.7 has historical support, intensifying PD solely to exceed this threshold has not shown mortality benefit, so I should individualize and avoid overtreatment that increases burden [^730d77a3] [^58833bef].

> Finally, I need to ensure quality metrics align with patient priorities. The SONG-PD core outcomes include life participation, treatment-related infection, cardiovascular events, patient and technique survival, and these should guide both clinical care and research evaluations. I should document shared decisions, track transitions and complications, and benchmark our program against infection rates and technique survival, iterating to improve patient-centered outcomes over time [^ff3efa6d] [^4debd3be].

Management of CKD in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients centers on **preserving residual kidney function** [^e213d287] and **individualized, goal-directed PD prescriptions** [^5365f90c] to maintain volume, blood pressure, and metabolic control while minimizing treatment burden [^a1730a67]. Key elements include: **incremental PD** [^5054a8d7] to match residual function, strict infection prevention [^c3871947], and proactive management of anemia, mineral metabolism, and nutrition [^c7baff50] [^6382fd53] [^061b1dac]. Shared decision-making [^6102eebf] and patient-reported outcomes guide adjustments, and **urgent-start PD** is feasible with appropriate protocols [^179e2232] [^050201ab]. Regular monitoring for complications — such as peritonitis, membrane dysfunction, and fluid overload — enables timely intervention and sustained quality of life [^4debd3be].

---

## Preservation of residual kidney function (RKF)

- **Importance**: RKF improves survival, fluid balance, phosphate control, and quality of life; its loss increases mortality and complications [^e213d287] [^e7c50bfc].

- **Strategies**: Use ACE inhibitors/ARBs, avoid nephrotoxins, and maintain optimal volume status to preserve RKF [^e7c50bfc].

- **Incremental PD**: Start with lower doses and titrate as RKF declines to reduce burden and preserve RKF [^5054a8d7] [^730d77a3].

---

## Individualized, goal-directed PD prescriptions

- **Person-centered care**: Tailor PD to patient goals, lifestyle, and clinical needs using shared decision-making [^5365f90c] [^6102eebf].

- **Clearance targets**: Avoid rigid Kt/V targets; prioritize symptom control, volume status, and quality of life [^730d77a3] [^a1730a67].

- **Modality selection**: Choose CAPD or APD based on patient preference, RKF, and lifestyle [^c81f30cf].

---

## Management of complications

### Volume status and blood pressure control

Volume status and blood pressure control rely on **strict salt restriction** and judicious use of diuretics when RKF permits [^e3245f47]. Icodextrin is used for long dwells to enhance ultrafiltration and reduce fluid overload [^42e3dd4a]. Blood pressure targets are individualized, generally aiming for < 130/80 mmHg when tolerated.

---

### Anemia management

Anemia management emphasizes **iron repletion** — intravenous iron preferred when indicated — and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents to maintain hemoglobin 10–12 g/dL [^c7baff50] [^606cba9c]. Regular monitoring of iron studies and hemoglobin guides therapy adjustments.

---

### Mineral and bone disorder (MBD)

Mineral and bone disorder management focuses on **phosphate binders** (calcium-based, non–calcium-based, or lanthanum) to maintain serum phosphate 3.5–5.5 mg/dL [^6382fd53]. Active vitamin D or calcimimetics are used to control secondary hyperparathyroidism, and serum calcium, phosphate, and PTH are monitored regularly.

---

### Nutritional management

Nutritional management emphasizes **protein intake** of 1.2–1.3 g/kg/day to offset peritoneal protein losses [^061b1dac]. Dietary phosphate restriction is balanced with protein needs, and nutritional status is assessed regularly with dietary counseling provided.

---

## Infection prevention and management

- **Peritonitis**: Strict aseptic technique, prophylactic antibiotics at catheter insertion, and prompt treatment of infections [^c3871947].

- **Exit-site care**: Daily cleansing and secure catheter fixation reduce infection risk [^notfound].

- **Urgent-start PD**: Safe and feasible with appropriate protocols, though leak risk is higher [^179e2232] [^050201ab].

---

## Patient education and shared decision-making

Patient education and shared decision-making are essential, with **comprehensive education** on PD technique, infection prevention, and symptom recognition [^3ca84bda]. Shared decision-making aligns treatment with patient values, preferences, and goals [^6102eebf]. Patient-reported outcomes are incorporated to guide care adjustments [^4a2b6955].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring and follow-up should include **regular assessments** of RKF, volume status, blood pressure, anemia, MBD, and nutrition. Complication surveillance focuses on peritonitis, membrane dysfunction, and fluid overload. Care plans are adjusted based on patient status, preferences, and outcomes [^5365f90c].

---

## Special considerations

- **Frailty and elderly**: Emphasize symptom control, quality of life, and conservative options when appropriate [^c0b7812c] [^e6ad2b83].

- **Diabetes**: Use icodextrin, adjust insulin, and monitor glycemic control closely [^6e5d0d27].

- **Polycystic kidney disease**: PD is viable; manage bulk symptoms and hernia risk [^4fa33668] [^99d2c584].

---

Effective CKD management in PD patients requires **individualized, goal-directed care** that preserves RKF, prevents complications, and aligns with patient preferences through shared decision-making [^5365f90c].

### Peritoneal dialysis – current status and future challenges [^18cf9dc2]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2013). Medium credibility.

Peritoneal dialysis is now a well established, mature treatment modality for advanced chronic kidney disease. The medium term (at least 5 year) survival of patients on peritoneal dialysis is currently equivalent to that of those on haemodialysis, and is particularly good in patients who are new to renal replacement therapy and have less comorbidity. Nevertheless the modality needs to keep pace with the constantly evolving challenges associated with the provision and delivery of health care. These challenges, which are gradually converging at a global level, include ageing of the population, multimorbidity of patients, containment of cost, increasing self care and environmental issues. In this context, peritoneal dialysis faces particular challenges that include multiple barriers to the therapy and unsatisfactory and poorly defined technique survival as well as limitations relating to intrinsic aspects of the therapy, such as peritoneal membrane longevity and hypoalbuminaemia. To move the therapy forward and favourably influence health-care policy, the peritoneal dialysis community needs to integrate their research effort more effectively by undertaking clinically meaningful studies-with a strong focus on technique survival — that are supported by multidisciplinary expertise in patient-centred outcomes, study design and analysis.

Background

End-stage kidney disease (ESKD) significantly impacts global public health, driven by an ageing population and increased chronic diseases. Over half of patients with ESKD are now over 65 years old, often with multiple comorbidities, complicating management and prognosis. The socioeconomic impact is considerable, and patients with ESKD face higher cancer risks. The interplay of kidney failure, cancer risk and comorbidities underscores the need for integrated care, including palliative care. Palliative peritoneal dialysis (PD) focuses on patient comfort, quality of life and autonomy, integrating palliative principles into dialysis.

Objective

This review aim to help construct palliative PD programmes for patients with ESKD in th end stage of life.

Design

A comprehensive review of existing literature on palliative care integretion in dialysis with emphasis on PD.

Methods and Data Sources

This review synthesized evidence from 37 reference encompassing the rationale, infrastructure, clinical protocols and reported outcome of palliative PD the implementation, challenges and benefits of palliative PD.

Findings

Palliative PD supports patient-centred care with flexible treatment schedules and reduces the physical burdens of in-centre dialysis. Key components include shre decision-making, symptom control and patient autonomy. Effective implementation requires training healthcare providers and fostering multidixciplinary collaboration.

Conclusion

Palliative PD represents a shift in treating advanced kidney disease, highlighting the importance of symptom relief, psychological support and patient empowerment.

### SAGES peritoneal dialysis access guideline update 2023 [^050201ab]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). High credibility.

Peritoneal dialysis decision criteria and additional considerations — context and rationale: Peritoneal Dialysis offers clinical and quality of life advantages over HD and there are cost benefits to home dialysis. In 2021, CMS passed the End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Treatment Choices Model, to improve or maintain the quality of care and reduce Medicare expenditures for patients with CKD, which promotes PD and kidney transplantation for its recipients. This has prompted a movement among nephrologists in the US to increase the penetration of PD and urgent start is one way to do this. In the past, patients needing urgent dialysis were given a venous catheter for inpatient HD and then discharged on scheduled outpatient HD, and once the patient developed this routine, they rarely switched to PD. Therefore, there are several benefits to avoiding urgent HD and instituting an urgent start PD program, and these may outweigh the increased risks involved.

### Managing hospitalized peritoneal dialysis patients: ten practical points for non-nephrologists [^b96c67a6]. The American Journal of Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Although nephrologists are responsible for the long-term care of dialysis patients, physicians from all disciplines will potentially be involved in the management of patients with kidney failure, including patients on peritoneal dialysis, the major home-based form of kidney-replacement therapy. This review aims to fill knowledge gaps of non-experts in peritoneal dialysis and to highlight key management aspects of in-hospital care of patients on peritoneal dialysis, with a focus on acute scenarios to facilitate prompt decision-making. The clinical pearls provided should enable non-nephrologists to avoid common pitfalls in the initial assessment of peritoneal dialysis-related complications and guide their decision regarding when to refer their patients to a specialist, resulting in improved multidisciplinary patient care.

### The prepare for kidney care study: prepare for renal dialysis versus responsive management in advanced chronic kidney disease [^2370647c]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

A range of integrated treatment options should be available for estimated 4.9–9.7 million people who develop end-stage kidney disease each year worldwide — haemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD), transplantation and conservative care. Reliable, stratified evidence of outcomes associated with each of these modalities is needed, whether local culture dictates that it is the patient, the family or the physician making the choice. This article provides background to and presents the evolution of a programme of work underway in the UK to provide more robust evidence in one of these areas: the comparative effectiveness of dialysis and conservative care in the frail older people with multiple health conditions.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health challenge characterized by a gradual decline in kidney function, leading to significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in its advanced stages. In patients with advanced CKD progressing to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), kidney replacement therapy (KRT) becomes necessary when kidney function has deteriorated to the extent that the kidneys can no longer effectively eliminate metabolic waste and excess fluids. Available KRT options include hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and kidney transplantation. Although these treatments can extend survival in patients with ESKD, certain populations — such as older adults and those with severe functional impairments — may derive limited survival benefit from these interventions. Previous studies have demonstrated that elderly patients undergoing hemodialysis experience a 2- to 4-fold higher mortality rate compared to younger patients, particularly in the early period following dialysis initiation.

Additionally, dialysis patients frequently experience a decline in functional status and quality of life, often feeling less independent and less able to engage in social activities. Evidence from prior studies indicates that dialysis patients generally report a lower quality of life compared to individuals with other chronic conditions, such as cancer, heart disease, and osteoarthritis. Moreover, approximately 30% of dialysis patients suffer from depression. These factors add complexity to decision-making around KRT, particularly when the benefit of dialysis may not be clear. Thus, the decision to initiate KRT often requires careful consideration of factors such as the patient's overall health status, quality of life, personal preferences, and the potential burdens of intensive treatment.

Conservative kidney management (CKM) provides a patient-centered approach focused on symptom management and psychosocial support, aiming to deliver holistic, individualized care. For patients with ESKD, who are not candidates for KRT, such as older adults and those with multiple comorbidities, CKM is the best option, as dialysis does not prolong lifespan compared to not having dialysis, and dialysis may lead to significant deterioration in quality of life or further complications. Evidence from systematic reviews indicates no significant difference in survival between elderly patients undergoing dialysis and those opting for conservative management, with similar 1-year survival rates. Furthermore, elderly patients who choose CKM reported improvements in quality of life, reduced symptom burden, fewer hospitalizations, and a greater likelihood of dying in their preferred setting.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2020 ISPD practice recommendations for prescribing high-quality goal-directed peritoneal dialysis [^c0b7812c]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Palliative peritoneal dialysis (PD) — "For some people who require dialysis and who are old, frail or have a poor prognosis, there may be a quality of life benefit from a reduced dialysis prescription to minimize the burden of treatment". The commentary emphasizes that "Individualizing PD therapy to maximize benefit and minimize burden is key in developing a high-quality goal-directed PD treatment plan", noting many goals "were developed without the frailest, most ill, and most elderly in mind", and that these individuals may have "limited life spans; therefore, managing symptoms and maximizing quality of life are the paramount objectives". The approach "begins with screening to identify people who would most benefit from this approach to PD prescription" followed by "a frank, detailed, and often difficult discussion" to define goals, "including whether dialysis therapies are concordant with their goals of care". Barriers include that "many nephrologists and other practitioners have limited experience and expertise in this aspect of care", and "such assessment may not be acceptable to some people with kidney failure".

### Factors related to patient selection and initiation of peritoneal dialysis [^3ee5a554]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2017). Low credibility.

The majority of dialysis patients initiate dialysis using hemodialysis, rather than peritoneal dialysis (PD), although they may be candidates for either modality. Multiple factors account for this selection, including pre-dialysis education, physician familiarity with hemodialysis versus PD, and patient-related factors. This paper will discuss the various considerations by both providers and patients in the selection of PD as a modality.

### Dialysis and transplant considerations in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [^99d2c584]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2023). Medium credibility.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the fourth leading cause of kidney replacement therapy. Unfortunately, the need for dialysis or kidney transplantation is a foreseeable outcome for many patients affected by ADPKD. We review some of the unique issues that should be considered in the management of patients with ADPKD who require dialysis or kidney transplantation. The choice of dialysis modality may be influenced by the enlarged kidneys and liver, but peritoneal dialysis should not be excluded as an option, as studies do not consistently show that there is an increased risk for technique failure or peritonitis. The optimal kidney replacement therapy option remains kidney transplantation; however, nephrectomy may be needed if there is insufficient space for the allograft. Living donor candidates from at-risk families need to be excluded from carrying the disease either by diagnostic imaging criteria or genetic testing. Other potential transplant issues, such as malignancy and cardiovascular and metabolic risks, should also be recognized. Despite these issues, patients with ADPKD requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation generally have more favorable outcomes as compared to those with other causes of chronic kidney disease. Further studies are still needed to personalize the therapeutic approach for those receiving kidney replacement therapy and eventually improve clinical outcomes.

### Perceptions about the dialysis modality decision process among peritoneal dialysis and in-center hemodialysis patients [^d54ce2bd]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Over 120,000 patients reaching end-stage renal disease (ESRD) every year in the United States (US) are faced with a complex and difficult decision regarding renal replacement therapy (RRT) modality options. Although kidney transplant results in the best clinical outcomes, 97% of ESRD patients will require dialysis, most frequently peritoneal dialysis (PD) or in-center hemodialysis (HD). Although clinical contraindications restrict modality choice in occasional cases, most patients are candidates for both PD and HD. Either dialysis modality may be a better fit for a specific patient based on dialysis treatment characteristics and their impact on daily life. Thus, the choice between modalities should center on patient preferences, and it is critical that patients are included and engaged in the dialysis modality decision. This is supported by increasing evidence that aligning treatment with patient preferences may improve adherence to therapy, quality of life, and ultimately better medical outcomes.

### Urgent start peritoneal dialysis [^1705a4f1]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although historically peritoneal dialysis was widely used in nephrology, it has been underutilized in recent years. In this review, we present several key opportunities and strategies for revitalization of urgent start peritoneal dialysis use, and discuss the recent literature on clinical experience with peritoneal dialysis use in the acute and unplanned setting.

Recent Findings

Interest in using urgent start peritoneal dialysis to manage acute kidney injury (AKI) and unplanned chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5 patients has been increasing. To overcome some of the classic limitations of peritoneal dialysis use in AKI, such as a high chance of infectious and mechanical complications, and no control of urea, the use of cycles, flexible catheters, and a high volume of dialysis fluid has been proposed. This knowledge can be used in the case of an unplanned start on chronic peritoneal dialysis, and may be a tool to increase the peritoneal dialysis penetration rate among incident patients starting chronic dialysis therapy.

Summary

Peritoneal dialysis should be offered in an unbiased way to all patients starting unplanned dialysis, and without contraindications to peritoneal dialysis. It may be a feasible, well tolerated, and complementary alternative to hemodialysis, not only in the chronic setting, but also in the acute.

### Kidney disease pathways, options and decisions: an environmental scan of international patient decision aids [^f0634514]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

A notable shift in clinical guidance for managing people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) Stages 4 and 5 [G4+; referred to herein as established kidney disease (EKD)] is to offer conservative management as an active treatment pathway alongside renal replacement therapies, dialysis and transplant. Most kidney services in Europe and North America have established educational programmes to help patients make decisions about their future treatment when their kidney disease is identified as progressing from chronic to EKD. Often known as pre-dialysis education, kidney professionals provide information about renal replacement options, focusing on discussions about which options fit best into a patient's life, including haemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD), with at-home or in-centre options. Conservative management is offered as an active option to manage symptoms arising from failing kidneys in patients meeting certain criteria, e.g. those > 75 years of age, with a high level of comorbidity and/or with a poor quality of life.

The conservative management and renal replacement therapy decision is complex and can be seen as a hierarchy of nested decisions (see Figure 1, adapted from Winterbottom et al. 2020) rather than a choice between discrete options. Decision-making takes place in the context of managing a long-term condition, with patients and professionals deliberating about treatment changes over months and years as kidney function stabilizes or continues to decline. Patients may switch or stop treatments as treatments fail, health worsens and life circumstances change. This dynamic context may explain why decision points are not easily identified or discussed and why patients may not be aware their kidney disease is worsening or may not be prepared to make shared decisions about future treatment with kidney professionals.

### Does peritoneal dialysis have a role in urgent-start end-stage kidney disease? [^e0d4ae4d]. Seminars in Dialysis (2018). Low credibility.

Despite its many positive attributes, peritoneal dialysis remains underutilized, particularly in the United States. Urgent-start peritoneal dialysis (PD) has been proposed as a method of increasing PD prevalence. Urgent-start PD has been shown to be safe, feasible, and effective. However, urgent-start PD is also accompanied by several multidimensional challenges. This article is intended to equip the reader with a practical sense of whether an urgent-start PD program would be appropriate in his or her own clinical context and if appropriate, what factors would be necessary for such a program to flourish. As such, we summarize latent factors, which are necessary to consider before instituting an urgent-start PD. Then, using a series of clinical vignettes, highlight the component parts of a successful urgent-start PD program and the patient population who stand to benefit most from this strategy. The discussion is then balanced by presenting limitations to consider in the urgent-start PD approach.

Person-centered care commentary — Person-centered care and shared decision making are described as critical during the entire trajectory of care for people with kidney disease, requiring education about condition and prognosis, offering a choice of prescriptions including the choice to not initiate or to discontinue long-term dialysis, and using patient-reported outcomes and experiences to measure and improve care, which are characterized as "rights" and "essentially an extension of informed consent".

### Transition of care from pre-dialysis prelude to renal replacement therapy: the blueprints of emerging research in advanced chronic kidney disease [^62a879d4]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

In patients with advanced (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 25 mL/min/1.73 m²) non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) the optimal transition of care to renal replacement therapy (RRT), i.e. dialysis or transplantation, is not known. Mortality and hospitalization risk are extremely high upon transition and in the first months following the transition to dialysis. Major knowledge gaps persist pertaining to differential or individualized transitions across different demographics and clinical measures during the 'prelude' period prior to the transition, particularly in several key areas: (i) the best timing for RRT transition; (ii) the optimal RRT type (dialysis versus transplant), and in the case of dialysis, the best modality (hemodialysis versus peritoneal dialysis), format (in-center versus home), frequency (infrequent versus thrice-weekly versus more frequent) and vascular access preparation; (iii) the post-RRT impact of pre-RRT prelude conditions and events such as blood pressure and glycemic control, acute kidney injury episodes, and management of CKD-specific conditions such as anemia and mineral disorders; and (iv) the impact of the above prelude conditions on end-of-life care and RRT decision-making versus conservative management of CKD. Given the enormous changes occurring in the global CKD healthcare landscape, as well as the high costs of transitioning to dialysis therapy with persistently poor outcomes, there is an urgent need to answer these important questions. This review describes the key concepts and questions related to the emerging field of 'Transition of Care in CKD', systematically defines six main categories of CKD transition, and reviews approaches to data linkage and novel prelude analyses along with clinical applications of these studies.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^64c941c3]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

Advanced chronic kidney disease and shared decision-making — The clinical management and care of patients with advanced CKD is complex, and the decision to pursue KRT in the very elderly, frail, or medically complex CKD population is challenging for patients, their families, and providers; conservative management without dialysis, focusing on symptom management, is a reasonable treatment option that may better align with patients' values and preferences, and it is important for providers to use SDM to determine patients' goals of care and educate patients about their options in an unbiased manner to assist patients in making an informed decision. Only two studies regarding the impact of SDM in the management of patients with advanced CKD were identified in the evidence base for the 2019 VA/DOD CKD CPG, and both provided Very low quality evidence that patient satisfaction increased when patients were actively involved with modality selection; the German Choice of Renal Replacement therapy (CORETH) project evaluated the difference in patient satisfaction between peritoneal dialysis (PD) and ICHD, showing a statistically significant increase in patient satisfaction for those who participated in the process of modality choice, and the European Kidney Patients' Federation (CEAPIR) surveyed approximately 4,000 patients who were either on HD or had a functioning kidney transplant and found that approximately 75% had been involved in modality selection, which appeared to be associated with higher levels of satisfaction with their selected treatment.

### The importance of residual renal function in dialysis patients [^e213d287]. Kidney International (2006). Low credibility.

Preserving residual renal function has always been the primary clinical goal for every nephrologist managing patients with chronic kidney disease. There is no reason why this important goal should not extend to patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease receiving dialysis. Indeed, there is now clear evidence that preserving residual renal function remains important after the commencement of dialysis. Residual renal function contributes significantly to the overall health and well-being of dialysis patients. It not only provides small solute clearance but also plays an important role in maintaining fluid balance, phosphorus control, and removal of middle molecular uremic toxins, and shows strong inverse relationships with valvular calcification and cardiac hypertrophy in dialysis patients. Decline of residual renal function also contributes significantly to anemia, inflammation, and malnutrition in patients on dialysis. More importantly, the loss of residual renal function, especially in patients on peritoneal dialysis, is a powerful predictor of mortality. In addition, there is increasing evidence that residual renal and peritoneal dialysis clearance cannot be assumed to be equivalent qualitatively, thus indicating the need to preserve residual renal function in patients on dialysis. In this article, we will review evidence that residual renal function is important in dialysis patients (especially peritoneal dialysis) and outline potential strategies that may better preserve residual renal function in dialysis patients.

### Peritoneal dialysis care for people with diabetes, polycystic kidney disease, or advanced liver disease [^6e5d0d27]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

People treated with peritoneal dialysis (PD) often have complicating conditions that require careful management. Three such conditions are reviewed in this article-diabetes mellitus, polycystic kidney disease, and chronic liver disease. Each of these conditions requires an understanding of both its effect on the delivery of the PD and the effect of the PD on the condition itself. In diabetes, glucose absorption from the dialysate complicates metabolic control and affects salt and water management and patient outcome. There is particular benefit in clinical care being delivered through a multidisciplinary team that involves both kidney and diabetes experts. In relation to polycystic kidney disease, a key issue is the potential for increased intraperitoneal pressure due to the combined effect of the enlarged polycystic organs and the presence of the dialysis solution, and therefore, the PD prescription requires to be managed with a particular focus on limiting that pressure. For patients with liver disease, key issues include nutritional support because PD can add to protein losses already consequent on the liver disease itself. Considered approaches are required to manage ascites and reduce infection risk and the potential for hernias and leaks to develop. Mortality in this group is unfortunately high-however, PD may present a better management option than hemodialysis in many patients-particularly in those where the liver disease is complicated by low BP, clotting abnormalities, or troublesome ascites. Overall, the choice to use PD in patients with these complicating conditions should be based on shared decision making with the patient and their family members informed by high-quality information in which risks, benefits, and management strategies are clearly presented.

### Chronic dialysis therapies [^714bf73a]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2024). Medium credibility.

While both in-center and home dialysis modalities have improved life expectancy for people with end-stage kidney disease and have served as a bridge to eventual kidney transplantation, kidney health care providers must be keenly aware of the potential complications associated with these therapies. The following questions aim to shed light on some of the more important potential physiological consequences and medical dilemmas associated with the three primary dialysis modalities including in-center hemodialysis, home hemodialysis, and peritoneal dialysis. Moreover, we hope to highlight that caring for those requiring dialytic therapy necessitates a significant breadth of understanding in other core internal medicine disciplines beyond nephrology itself, including cardiovascular, infectious, and musculoskeletal disease entities.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for hemodialysis adequacy: 2015 update [^2f18ad56]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

KDOQI hemodialysis adequacy — timing of hemodialysis initiation. Patients who reach chronic kidney disease stage 4 (GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) should receive education about kidney failure and treatment options including kidney transplantation, peritoneal dialysis (PD), hemodialysis (HD) in the home or in-center, and conservative treatment, and family members/caregivers should also be educated (Not Graded). The decision to initiate maintenance dialysis should be based primarily on assessment of signs and/or symptoms associated with uremia, evidence of protein-energy wasting, and the ability to safely manage metabolic abnormalities and/or volume overload with medical therapy rather than on a specific level of kidney function in the absence of such signs and symptoms (Not Graded).

### Outcomes of incident patients treated with incremental haemodialysis as compared with standard haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis [^df411a9b]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

KEY LEARNING POINTS

What is already known about this subject?

Residual kidney function has been associated with improved survival in dialysis patients and is considered better preserved with twice-weekly incremental haemodialysis (I-HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) as compared with conventional thrice-weekly HD (TW-HD).
Despite current guidelines supporting an incremental approach to HD initiation, the vast majority of patients requiring kidney replacement therapy (KRT) still begin on conventional TW-HD in resource-rich countries.

What this study adds?

In selected patients initiating dialysis, I-HD is a suitable KRT modality that can be maintained for a significant amount of time before transitioning to a conventional TW-HD regimen.
In the appropriate clinical setting, I-HD initiation is associated with improved survival as compared with TW-HD or PD.

What impact this may have on practice or policy?

An I-HD regimen can be safely implemented in patients initiating dialysis when carefully selected.
These results reinforce current guidelines and call for long-awaited randomized controlled trials prior to large-scale implementation of I-HD programmes.

Clinical utility of shared decision making — This guideline is of high clinical utility because people do best when they are well informed and engaged, and kidney failure is a lifelong condition; individuals will be more likely to follow the treatment regimen when respected and involved in the decision-making process, understanding of prognosis prepares people for what to expect and might help with coping and acceptance, and the guideline outlines specific conversations providers should have such as consideration of manual versus automated PD (APD), incremental PD, and palliative PD.

### Research directions: new clinical frontiers [^8c5a10f6]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2000). Low credibility.

One of the greatest remaining challenges facing nephrology research is obtaining data with detail and precision for the three large, yet "forgotten", populations that span the spectrum of kidney disease: patients with chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), peritoneal dialysis patients, and kidney transplant patients. Studies of these populations, particularly the CRI group, are hampered by the relative mobility of these patients, the lack of stringent epidemiologic or clinical definitions, and the tendency to extrapolate data from hemodialysis populations into other clinical settings. This article suggests a two-pronged approach to a research agenda: first, by recognizing the need for better data regarding the natural history of these kidney failure subsets and their comorbidities; and second, by directing greater effort at identifying rational, efficacious, and cost-effective interventions to influence their natural history positively. Specific efforts are suggested in all three populations. For patients with CRI, studies should be directed at (1) identifying high-risk patients; (2) determining methods for making optimal referrals to the nephrologist; (3) identifying and managing CRI, its complications, and its comorbid conditions; and (4) establishing processes for the smooth transition to dialysis. The peritoneal dialysis population will benefit from studies addressing the treatment of anemia and its ability to modify cardiovascular illness and quality of life. Kidney transplant studies should also focus on the identification and management of comorbid conditions, as well as the effects of various interventions on quality of life. Rational evidence-based care of these conditions, which are critically important to patients, their families, and the health care system in general, must await the conduct of well-designed prospective observational and interventional trials.

### Blood pressure management… [^409cc07a]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

- Treating type 2 diabetes with metformin in CKD reduces mortality and can be continued until eGFR drops to 30 mL per minute per 1.73 m². SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists also improve outcomes in CKD. From the AFP Editors. Blood Pressure Management One meta-analysis suggests reduced mortality in CKD when systolic blood pressure is maintained below 140 mm Hg. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers should be used to treat patients who have CKD with albuminuria and diabetes mellitus. For CKD with albuminuria but no diabetes, an ACE inhibitor is preferred because of a 31% reduction in end-stage renal disease. Treatment of Diabetes with CKD Metformin is considered first-line therapy to decrease mortality in type 2 diabetes with CKD. Metformin can be started above an eGFR of 45 mL per minute per 1.73 m² and safely continued until eGFR drops to 30 mL per minute per 1.73 m².

Consider additional treatment with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists to reduce CKD progression. SGLT-2 inhibitors slow CKD progression and reduce hospitalization for heart failure, with uncertain effect on mortality. Based on a post-hoc trial analysis, GLP-1 receptor agonists appear to reduce major cardiovascular events and mortality in CKD and may slightly reduce CKD progression. Conversely, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors do not improve outcomes in CKD. Adjunctive Treatment in CKD When CKD is complicated by metabolic acidosis, sodium bicarbonate supplementation should be used to slow progression to end-stage renal disease. Although CKD is associated with hyperuricemia, urate-lowering therapy does not slow CKD progression. Vitamin D, calcimimetics, and phosphate binders do not improve patient-oriented outcomes, even if parathyroid hormone levels are elevated.

In CKD, anemia is often associated with iron deficiency. Although intravenous iron replacement is most efficient, oral replacement is optimal when taken every other day. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents should not be used when hemoglobin is 10 g per dL or more.

### Peritoneal dialysis prescription and adequacy in clinical practice: core curriculum 2023 [^a1730a67]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

As the global prevalence of peritoneal dialysis (PD) continues to grow, practitioners must be equipped with prescribing strategies that focus on the needs and preferences of patients. PD is an effective form of kidney replacement therapy that offers numerous benefits to patients, including more flexibility in schedules compared with in-center hemodialysis (HD). Additional benefits of PD include salt and water removal without significant changes in patient hemodynamics. This continuous yet gentle removal of solutes and fluid is associated with better-preserved residual kidney function. Unfortunately, sometimes these advantages are overlooked at the expense of an emphasis on achieving small solute clearance targets. A more patient-centered approach emphasizes the importance of individualized treatment, particularly when considering incremental PD and other prescriptions that align with lifestyle preferences. In shifting the focus from small solute clearance targets to patient needs and clinical goals, PD remains an attractive, patient-centered form of kidney replacement therapy.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the prevention, diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hepatitis C in CKD [^cd2768a9]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2008). Medium credibility.

KDIGO guideline process for hepatitis C virus (HCV) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) defines the target population as patients with CKD stages 1 to 5, as well as those on dialysis therapy (HD or peritoneal dialysis) and kidney transplant recipients, and focuses on 5 aspects of management (diagnosis; treatment; preventing transmission in HD facilities; management of infected patients before and after kidney transplantation; and management of kidney diseases associated with HCV infection). For study inclusion, eligible studies evaluated patients with any CKD stage being tested or treated for HCV infection, and for treatment-related topics the work group primarily considered clinical outcomes (including adverse events) or sustained virological response (SVR). A modification of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) method was applied to appraise evidence, and recommendations were rated as strong, moderate, or weak based on the quality of evidence and other considerations, including the size of the effect estimate and values and preferences; costs were not formally considered. Context for the United States burden is noted, with an estimated 3.2 million Americans chronically infected with the virus.

### Fluid overload as a therapeutic target for the preservative management of chronic kidney disease [^7b79a9a1]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There is growing clinical evidence of adverse effects of fluid overload on kidney outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease who are not yet receiving kidney replacement therapy. In this review, we discuss the patient populations most at risk for fluid overload, the pathophysiology associated with fluid overload, and finally treatment options.

Recent Findings

The severity of fluid overload is an independent risk factor for both an increased risk of rapidly declining kidney function and increased risk for the need of kidney replacement therapy. High venous pressure within the kidney secondarily causes a decrease in kidney perfusion, which in turn signals salt retention and the resulting increase in plasma volume completes a vicious cycle propagating ongoing kidney injury. Fluid overload has also been identified as a risk factor for the combined outcome of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular morbidity. This increased risk in some studies has been identified as more important than hypertension in predicting both the increased risk of kidney disease progression and morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease. Once fluid status is accurately assessed, a combination of salt restriction and effective diuretic therapy is the first-line therapy to manage this complication. In those patients who require additional therapy, use of a V2 receptor antagonists can be considered. Finally, some patients may benefit from peritoneal dialysis to bring about volume removal even if they do not yet require dialysis for uremic complications.

Summary

Excess fluid or fluid overload appears to enhance chronic kidney disease progression and its treatment and resolution is a potential disease-modifying intervention.

### The impact of low-protein diet on residual renal function in dialysis patients: a systematic review and metaanalysis [^88928cb3]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

As a significant global public health issue, chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects millions of people worldwide. The progression of CKD can result in a gradual deterioration of renal function and ultimately come to end-stage renal disease (ESKD), requiring life-sustaining peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis. While these methods effectively remove waste and excess water from the body, they also present various complications and reduce quality of life.

Residual renal function, the portion that remains functional during dialysis, plays a crucial role in fluid and electrolyte balance control, reducing dialysis-related complications, improving quality of life, and increasing survival rates. Therefore, preserving residual renal function has become a key objective in treating CKD patients.

In the nutritional management of kidney disease, low-protein diets have always been an important consideration. These diets are designed to alleviate strain on the kidneys and slow down further decline in renal function. For dialysis patients specifically, appropriate protein intake is essential for maintaining nutritional status, enhancing treatment outcomes, and safeguarding residual renal function. However, in published meta-analyses, it is controversial whether a low-protein diet has an impact on residual renal function among CKD patients. At the same time, studies among dialysis patients on the influence of low-protein diets on residual renal function have produced inconsistent results due to factors such as study design, patient characteristics, and dialysis mode. The safety of low-protein diets also needs to be further explored due to possible malnutrition and other problems.

As such, this meta-analysis aims to comprehensively assess the influence of low-protein diets on dialysis patients' residual renal function and potential safety issues. By rigorously screening existing literature for data extraction and quality assessment purposes, this study will further delve into the mechanism by which low-protein diets affect residual renal function in this specific population as well as their potential clinical value so as to provide a more robust evidence base for nutritional treatment strategies targeting the progression of kidney diseases.

The guideline is extremely welcomed by the Renal Association and it offers huge value to patients, clinicians, commissioners and key stakeholders. It overlaps and enhances current guidance published by the Renal Association including "Haemodialysis" (Clinical practice guideline: Haemodialysis; 2019) which was updated in 2019 after the publication of the NICE guideline, "Peritoneal Dialysis in Adults and Children" (Clinical practice guideline: peritoneal Dialysis in adults and children; 2017) and "Planning, Initiation & withdrawal of Renal Replacement Therapy" (Clinical practice guideline: planning, initiation and withdrawal of renal replacement therapy; 2014) (at present there are no plans to update this guideline).

There are several strengths to NICE guideline NG107 and we agree with and support the vast majority of recommendation statements in the guideline. This summary from the Renal Association discusses some of the key highlights, controversies, gaps in knowledge and challenges in implementation. Where there is disagreement with a NICE guideline statement, we have highlighted this and a new suggested statement has been written.

### Update on peritoneal dialysis solutions [^cfa97845]. Kidney International (2007). Low credibility.

Since the widespread introduction of peritoneal dialysis (PD) into the standard care of patients with chronic kidney disease there has been a shift from the initial focus on technique survival to refinement of the therapy to enhance biocompatibility and improve both the local peritoneal and systemic consequences of PD. One of the most significant contributions to these advances has been the development of novel PD solutions. The use of new manufacturing techniques, buffer presentation, and new osmotic alternatives to glucose have allowed potentially improved peritoneal survival (in terms of structure and function) and improved subjective patient experience. Additional benefits have also included, enhanced management of salt and water removal, supported nutritional status and improvement in the systemic metabolic derangements associated with conventional PD treatment, based on glucose-containing lactate-buffered solutions. The selection of suitable targets for modulation of therapy continues to be hampered by our continued relative ignorance of the local and particularly systemic effects of PD compounded by the dearth of quality, outcome-based studies. The aim of this review is to summarize the characteristics of the next generation of PD fluids currently available, and then to evaluate their possible place in treatment by considering the difference in their effects in a series of structural and functional areas potentially relevant to improving patient outcomes.

### In search of common ground-nephrologists' experiences in preparing and informing patients on the path to end-stage kidney disease [^15946fd3]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with progressive chronic kidney disease who are not candidates for kidney transplantation will eventually face the choice of starting dialysis to replace lost kidney function or opting for conservative kidney management. This situation is quite common. In Sweden, the number of patients on dialysis was 4082 in 2023. Of these patients, the majority (3052) were treated in hospital dialysis units, while 924 received peritoneal dialysis and 106 had home hemodialysis.

Dialysis is a time-consuming treatment that does not always alleviate all the symptoms that patients experience. Over time, there is often a progression of symptoms and underlying medical conditions, both somatic and mental, requiring more hospital care. Committing to a treatment plan is typically a high-stakes decision, involving several important considerations. Although nephrologists are the ones who present treatment options, it is the patients who ultimately give or withhold consent. Patients therefore need adequate information about the disease, the available treatment options and their likely outcomes, delivered in an understandable and otherwise appropriate manner. Nephrologists are central to the provision of such information. Their perspectives on the goals of information sharing, what should be shared, the challenges they face, and the strategies they employ to achieve these goals and overcome the challenges, can have a significant impact on what information reaches the patient and how it will be perceived.

To explore the prospects for successful physician-patient dialogue in the face of potentially difficult treatment decisions, it is important to learn about nephrologists' perspectives on sharing information with patients. Information sharing in the context of progressive kidney disease has been studied previously, but mainly from the specific perspective of the prospects for implementing shared decision-making, empowering patients to participate more fully in decision making and tailoring treatment to their personal needs and preferences. This article addresses the complexities of information sharing more broadly, by exploring the attitudes and experiences of Swedish nephrologists regarding the process of informing patients considering whether to start dialysis, as well as the modality of dialysis chosen - either self-managed home dialysis or staff-managed hospital dialysis.

### Are diuretics underutilized in dialysis patients? [^e3245f47]. Seminars in Dialysis (2016). Low credibility.

While oral diuretics are commonly used in patients with chronic kidney disease for the management of volume and blood pressure, they are often discontinued upon initiation of dialysis. We suggest that diuretics are considerably underutilized in peritoneal dialysis and haemodialysis patients despite numerous potential benefits and few side effects. Moreover, when diuretics are used, optimal doses are not always prescribed. In peritoneal dialysis, the use of diuretics can improve volume status and minimize the need for higher glucose-containing solutions. In patients on haemodialysis, diuretics can help lessen interdialytic weight gain, resulting in decreased ultrafiltration rates and fewer episodes of intradialytic hypotension. This paper will review the mechanism of action of diuretics in patients with renal insufficiency, quantify the risk of side effects and elaborate on the potential advantages of diuretic use in peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis patients with residual kidney function.

### Unmet needs about iron deficiency in peritoneal dialysis: a Delphi consensus panel [^efb39491]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Anaemia is commonly encountered in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with reduced quality of life and increased cardiovascular disease, hospitalizations, cognitive impairment, and mortality. In this context anaemia is a multifactorial process due to relative erythropoietin (EPO) deficiency, uremic-induced inhibitors of erythropoiesis, shortened erythrocyte survival, and disordered iron homeostasis. Iron deficiency (ID) is defined as either a true paucity of iron stores (absolute ID) or as a relative deficiency (functional) in which the patient exhibits an impaired iron release from body stores that is unable to meet the demand for erythropoiesis (also called reticuloendothelial cell iron blockade). There is growing interest about the role of iron supplementation in CKD, particularly ferric carboxymaltose (FCM), also in relation to the use of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs). Indeed, ESA treatment results in a substantial increase in the iron demand for erythropoiesis, and about 90% of ESA-treated patients require iron supplementation to sustain an optimal haematological response to ESAs. Moreover, despite a greater knowledge on ID management in patients receiving haemodialysis, a paucity of data and no international guidelines exist about peritoneal dialysis (PD). Also the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) controversies paper about optimal anaemia management does not cite specific doubts about PD. A specific necessity of having dedicated recommendations is growing, not borrowed from general CKD guidelines or haemodialysis indications. Furthermore, the aim of this paper is to provide the results of a nationwide survey about ID in PD using the Delphi method.

### Commentary on the NICE guideline on renal replacement therapy and conservative management [^44089c58]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Indications for switching or stopping renal replacement therapy

We are in support of the guidance on switching treatment modalities or stopping renal replacement therapy. The recommendation not to electively swap patients on PD to other modalities in anticipation of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) is very much consistent with consensus view as per the ISPD position paper. Whilst longer PD vintage is associated with a higher risk of EPS, evidence of that elective transition from PD is preventative is lacking.

RRT patients are likely to utilise different modalities at different time points of their disease. It is therefore important to consider treatment pathways rather than individual RRT techniques Perspectives of patients, caregivers, and health professionals on the process of transitioning are even less well documented. Available literature suggests that at present, transition between the different modalities is poorly coordinated, causing significant morbidity and mortality. While predictors of PD technique failure and transition to HD have been assessed in some studies, clinical outcomes following transfer from PD to in-centre HD are lacking. HD-to-PD transition, has been associated with an increased risk of death and technique failure. Given that more than one-third of patients will experience a transition to another RRT modality, particularly to facility-based conventional HD within the first 3 years on PD, a better understanding of morbidity and mortality associated with this transition is critically important for the care of patients with ESKD.

A key transition point is during hospitalisation and readmissions for both RRT and conservative care patients. Systems for improving communication between the hospital and nephrologist about patient care are needed. Transition considerations as outlined in the guideline are key to address such high-risk periods in patient lives on RRT. Robust policies informed by ongoing research will be required for implementation.

Recognising symptoms, diet and fluids and information, education and support

We fully support the guidance on recognising symptoms during the course of RRT, providing adequate nutritional support and developing resources and systems to provide adequate information, education and support to patients, carers and family members. Growth failure can be an important manifestation of CKD in the younger population; clinicians should be aware of this and monitor it not only through weight history but also through charting of height and weight on age-appropriate growth charts.

### End-stage renal disease: medical management | AAFP… [^2072cbc2]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Dialysis Most patients elect to receive dialysis to treat their ESRD, 5 and these patients tend to live longer than those choosing conservative management. 12 Yet, because of the time commitment, discomfort, and complications associated with dialysis, shared decision-making should be used, with adequate time for patients to consider the various dialysis modalities and the option of conservative management. 3 Many patients do not receive adequate education before starting dialysis, and one survey showed that 61% of patients who chose dialysis later regretted the decision.
8. In the United States, nearly 90% of patients with ESRD are treated with center-based hemodialysis, but many patients are unaware that other options exist. 5, 13 Alternatives include in-home hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, which can provide flexibility in frequency and duration of dialysis sessions.

Patients who receive targeted education before the initiation of dialysis are more likely to choose peritoneal dialysis. 13–15. |Uncontrolled hypertension| Most patients with ESRD will be treated with hemodialysis, and arteriovenous access is usually preferred. Early referral allows for evaluation and creation of vascular access before dialysis is needed. For patients with stage III to V chronic kidney disease, strategies to preserve peripheral venous access are important. These include avoiding excessive venipuncture, peripherally inserted central venous catheters, and subclavian venous catheters. Conservative Kidney Management Patients with ESRD can elect a palliative approach to managing their disease that does not involve dialysis. This approach emphasizes quality of life over the prolongation of life. Although dialysis offers a survival benefit, that benefit decreases, and may disappear, with increasing patient age and comorbidity.

12 The overall symptom burden does not substantially improve in patients treated with dialysis, and they are more likely to receive medical interventions and to be hospitalized. 19, 20 Conservative kidney management may be a reasonable alternative to dialysis, particularly for individuals with limited life expectancy or severe comorbid conditions and for those who strongly wish to avoid medical interventions. This topic was discussed further in a previous issue of AFP.
21. Chronic metabolic acidosis is typically resolved with dialysis, but because the condition is associated with increased mortality and other adverse outcomes, those with persistently low bicarbonate concentrations may require oral bicarbonate supplementation.

### Lanthanum carbonate versus placebo for management of hyperphosphatemia in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis: a subgroup analysis of a phase 2 randomized controlled study of dialysis patients [^6382fd53]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Up to 80% of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5 have levels of serum phosphate above the normal range (0.8–1.5 mmol/l). Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis are typically used as part of the management strategy in patients with CKD stage 5, but even with regular dialysis, serum phosphate often exceeds 2.1 mmol/l, a level associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Restricting the intake of dietary phosphate to 800–1000 mg/day is recommended to help manage hyperphosphatemia. However, care must be taken to maintain adequate protein intake because poor nutrition is also associated with increased mortality.

Recent reimbursement changes in the US healthcare system may result in greater use of peritoneal dialysis. Malnutrition and comorbidities (including cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory or liver disease, and carcinoma) are independently associated with mortality in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis, and these two factors in combination are associated with the worst outcomes. Protein loss across the peritoneal membrane during peritoneal dialysis places a greater nutritional burden on patients compared with those on hemodialysis, and this loss of protein is exacerbated by peritonitis, a major complication of peritoneal dialysis. Maintaining adequate protein intake is therefore an important part of the management strategy for patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis. However, protein intake can be impeded by poor appetite, and increasing dietary protein can place an increased phosphate burden on the patient.

### Reaching consensus on the important outcomes for peritoneal dialysis patients [^4debd3be]. Kidney International (2019). Medium credibility.

The Standardized Outcomes in Nephrology (SONG) initiative is designed to improve research productivity by building consensus. Stakeholders involved with peritoneal dialysis (PD) have put life participation on top of their list, along with treatment-related infection, cardiovascular complications, and patient and technique survival. This should lead to improved reporting of these outcomes and their prioritization in future research.

### Considerations in the optimal preparation of patients for dialysis [^e05efb38]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2012). Medium credibility.

Every year, more than 110,000 Americans are newly diagnosed with end-stage renal disease and in the overwhelming majority, maintenance dialysis therapy is initiated. However, most patients, having received no predialysis nephrology care or dietary counseling, are inadequately prepared for starting treatment; furthermore, the majority of patients do not have a functioning permanent dialysis access. Annualized mortality in the USA in the first 3 months after starting dialysis treatment is approximately 45%; this high rate is possibly in part due to inadequate preparation for renal replacement therapy. Data from the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns study suggest that similar challenges exist in many parts of the world. Implementation of strategies that mitigate the risk of adverse consequences when starting dialysis are urgently needed. In this Review we present a step-by-step approach to tackling inadequate patient preparation, which includes identifying individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are most likely to need dialysis in the future, referring patients for education, timely placement of dialysis access and timely initiation of dialysis therapy. Treatment with dialysis might not be appropriate for some patients with progressive CKD; these individuals can be optimally managed with nondialytic, maximum conservative management.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2020 ISPD practice recommendations for prescribing high-quality goal-directed peritoneal dialysis [^5365f90c]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The recently published 2020 International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) practice recommendations regarding prescription of high-quality goal-directed peritoneal dialysis differ fundamentally from previous guidelines that focused on "adequacy" of dialysis. The new ISPD publication emphasizes the need for a person-centered approach with shared decision making between the individual performing peritoneal dialysis and the clinical care team while taking a broader view of the various issues faced by that individual. Cognizant of the lack of strong evidence for the recommendations made, they are labeled as "practice points" rather than being graded numerically. This commentary presents the views of a work group convened by the National Kidney Foundation's Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) to assess these recommendations and assist clinical providers in the United States in interpreting and implementing them. This will require changes to the current clinical paradigm, including greater resource allocation to allow for enhanced services that provide a more holistic and person-centered assessment of the quality of dialysis delivered.

### Peritoneal dialysis | NEJM resident 360… [^8a5a8873]. resident360.nejm.org (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Pearls Q: Are there many contraindications to peritoneal dialysis. A: There are only a few absolute contraindications to peritoneal dialysis. These include an insufficiently clean environment in which to perform exchanges, an inadequate cognitive or physical ability on the part of the patient or an assisting partner to learn and perform peritoneal dialysis, and lack of a suitable peritoneal cavity due to extensive scarring or adhesions. The degree of scarring often cannot be assessed until the peritoneal cavity is visualized laparoscopically at the time of attempted catheter placement. Q: How often does peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis result in hospitalization. A: Although many episodes of peritoneal dialysis–related peritonitis can be treated in the outpatient setting, approximately 50% of episodes result in hospitalization. The majority of episodes are successfully treated without removal of the peritoneal dialysis catheter.

The catheter should be removed if peritonitis fails to resolve after 5 days of treatment with appropriate antibiotics or in cases of fungal peritonitis. Mortality from peritoneal dialysis–related peritonitis ranges from 3 to 10%. The risk of death after an episode of peritonitis remains elevated for up to 120 days after resolution of the episode itself. A: Many hospitals lack personnel with experience in the performance of peritoneal dialysis. As a result, sometimes a central venous catheter is placed and hemodialysis is performed when it is not actually required. In addition, many surgeons believe that patients treated with peritoneal dialysis who are undergoing surgery must be switched to hemodialysis during the postoperative period, often for many weeks, if not permanently. Concerns cited include leakage of dialysate through an abdominal incision, delayed wound healing, and the risk of peritonitis with possible subsequent infection of foreign materials. However, study data and anecdotal experiences do not support such concerns. In patients undergoing hernia repair or a variety of laparoscopic procedures, peritoneal dialysis can often be resumed within 48 hours after surgery by performing small-volume exchanges with the patient in the supine position, thereby minimizing intraabdominal pressure. The same is true for surgeries associated with relatively small upper abdominal incisions. Patients undergoing bowel procedures that involve large anterior abdominal incisions should probably have a 2-to-3-week hiatus from peritoneal dialysis.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on peritoneal dialysis in adults and children [^67d29c20]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Rationale for clinical practice guidelines for peritoneal dialysis

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) (guidelines PD 1.1–1.5)

Guideline 1.1 – PD: Equipment and resources

We recommend that Peritoneal Dialysis should be delivered in the context of a comprehensive and integrated service for renal replacement therapies, including haemodialysis (including temporary backup facilities), transplantation and conservative care. Both continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and automated peritoneal dialysis (APD), in all its forms should be available (1C).

Guideline 1.1.2 – PD: Equipment and resources

We recommend that a dedicated PD nursing team should be part of the multidisciplinary team (1C).

Guideline 1.1.3 – PD: Equipment and resources

We recommend that where feasible, each unit has a designated lead clinician for PD (1C).

Guideline 1.1.4 – PD: Equipment and resources

We recommend that assisted PD should be available to patients wishing to have home dialysis treatment but unable to perform self-care PD, including as a temporary measure where a patient who is, or will become, independent is unable to perform PD alone (1C).

Rationale

Evidence from observational studies or registry data, with all its limitations, indicate that peritoneal dialysis (PD) used in the context of an integrated dialysis programme is associated with good clinical outcomes, certainly comparable to haemodialysis in the medium term (HD) and potentially better in the first 2 years of dialysis. NICE recommends PD as the initial dialysis treatment of choice of chronic kidney disease stage 5 for children aged 2 years or older, people with residual renal function and adults without significant associated comorbidities (NICE Clinical Guideline 125, 2011). The only randomised study (NECOSAD), comparing HD to PD as a first treatment showed no differences in 2 year quality adjusted life years or 5 year mortality, but the number randomised was insufficient to generalize this observation; notably, most patients in this national study had sufficient life-style preferences related to one modality to decline randomisation. PD has a significant technique failure rate however, so patients need to be able to switch treatment modality (to either temporary or permanent HD) in a timely manner, which has implications for HD capacity and the timing for HD access creation.

### Patient perspectives and preferences for rehabilitation among people living with frailty and chronic kidney disease: a qualitative evaluation [^616f8be3]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Frailty has been characterised as a state of accelerated aging with increased vulnerability to adverse outcomes and non-routine recovery from relatively minor insults. Our previous work exploring frailty in the context of chronic kidney disease (CKD) has demonstrated that frailty is a psycho-emotional-social experience that interacts with comorbidity and symptoms of uraemia. Frailty is highly prevalent among patients with advanced CKD, with rates of frailty ranging from 30 to 80% among patients with late-stage CKD and undergoing dialysis, compared to rates of 12% in study participants with stage 3 CKD. Frailty onset occurs at a young age with up to 63% of patients younger than 40 years manifesting frailty at dialysis initiation. As in the general population, traditional risk factors of sarcopenia, inflammation and oxidative stress promote frailty, while CKD-specific factors of uraemia, anaemia, mineral bone disease, impaired nutrition, polypharmacy and dialysis therapy exacerbate its severity. Frailty in this context is associated with various adverse patient outcomes including accelerated CKD progression, worse cognitive impairment and symptom burden, increased risk of hospitalisation, excess infective and cardiovascular complications, reduced access to the benefits of kidney transplantation and death.

To date there are limited formal guidelines on interventions to maintain or improve functional status in CKD populations. The Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes initiative recommends that patients with kidney disease should be encouraged to increase their level of physical activity through exercise training incorporating self-monitoring, verbal reinforcement and motivational support. In a position statement published by the Japanese Society of Renal Rehabilitation, the authors acknowledge the persistent legacy of reports from the 1990's endorsing rest for patients with CKD, and especially with nephrotic syndrome, where exercise may exacerbate proteinuria and accelerate renal function decline. Contemporary evidence informing this rehabilitation guideline instead supports the use of exercise therapy in CKD, haemodialysis and transplant populations, but remains limited in its examination of impact on hospitalisation, cardiovascular events and mortality outcomes. Likewise, the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis in collaboration with the Global Renal Exercise Network have recently published practice recommendations for physical activity and exercise in peritoneal dialysis, acknowledging limitations in the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations in the context of frailty with most recommendations denoted 2D (weakly recommended, very little confidence in the estimate of the effect).

### Peritoneal dialysis has optimal intradialytic hemodynamics and preserves residual renal function: why isn' T it better than hemodialysis? [^54eef4e8]. Seminars in Dialysis (2019). Medium credibility.

Rates of cardiovascular mortality are disproportionately high in patients with end stage kidney disease receiving dialysis. However, it is now generally accepted that patient survival is broadly equivalent between the two most frequently used forms of dialysis, in-center hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD). This equivalent patient survival is notable when considering how specific aspects of HD have been shown to contribute to morbidity and mortality. These include more rapid loss of residual renal function (RRF), HD-induced myocardial and cerebral ischemia, and risk factors associated with the intermittent delivery of HD. Potential mechanisms specific to PD that may drive cardiovascular disease include the metabolic consequences of excessive absorption of glucose and glucose degradation products (GDPs), inadequate volume control, and high rates of hypokalemia. The aim of this review is to compare and contrast the different drivers of adverse outcomes between the dialysis modalities, as greater understanding of this may help in patient-centered decision-making when considering options for renal replacement therapy.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) updates the KDIGO 2012 guideline and has been developed with patient partners, clinicians, and researchers around the world, using robust methodology. This update, based on a substantially broader base of evidence than has previously been available, reflects an exciting time in nephrology. New therapies and strategies have been tested in large and diverse populations that help to inform care; however, this guideline is not intended for people receiving dialysis nor those who have a kidney transplant. The document is sensitive to international considerations, CKD across the lifespan, and discusses special considerations in implementation. The scope includes chapters dedicated to the evaluation and risk assessment of people with CKD, management to delay CKD progression and its complications, medication management and drug stewardship in CKD, and optimal models of CKD care. Treatment approaches and actionable guideline recommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant studies and appraisal of the quality of the evidence and the strength of recommendations which followed the "Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation" (GRADE) approach. The limitations of the evidence are discussed. The guideline also provides practice points, which serve to direct clinical care or activities for which a systematic review was not conducted, and it includes useful infographics and describes an important research agenda for the future. It targets a broad audience of people with CKD and their healthcare, while being mindful of implications for policy and payment.

### Incremental peritoneal dialysis: new ideas about an old approach [^5054a8d7]. Seminars in Dialysis (2018). Low credibility.

Coping with the transition from end-stage kidney disease to dialysis can be challenging for patients and their care partners. Introducing incident dialysis patients to incremental forms of dialysis is associated with better quality of life and reduced cost. Incremental hemodialysis (HD) has generated significant interest over the last decade with treatments that focus on clinical criteria rather than prespecified Kt/V urea targets. Incremental peritoneal dialysis (PD) has traditionally focused on the sum of residual renal and peritoneal clearances to achieve a specific Kt/V urea value. Gradual increases in the PD dose were prescribed as the residual kidney function declined. Adopting a new approach to incremental PD similar to what has been done for incremental HD would obviate the need for Kt/V urea and focus exclusively on clinical criteria. New incremental PD may be considered less disruptive to incident dialysis patients, and may be more likely to be accepted as treatment. It will also reduce our obsession with small solute kinetics and enhance encounters with patients by focusing instead on the holisitc clinical assessment.

### Home dialysis: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) controversies conference [^72e2ea2b]. Kidney International (2023). Medium credibility.

Home dialysis modalities (home hemodialysis [HD] and peritoneal dialysis [PD]) are associated with greater patient autonomy and treatment satisfaction compared with in-center modalities, yet the level of home-dialysis use worldwide is low. Reasons for limited utilization are context-dependent, informed by local resources, dialysis costs, access to healthcare, health system policies, provider bias or preferences, cultural beliefs, individual lifestyle concerns, potential care-partner time, and financial burdens. In May 2021, KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) convened a controversies conference on home dialysis, focusing on how modality choice and distribution are determined and strategies to expand home-dialysis use. Participants recognized that expanding use of home dialysis within a given health system requires alignment of policy, fiscal resources, organizational structure, provider incentives, and accountability. Clinical outcomes across all dialysis modalities are largely similar, but for specific clinical measures, one modality may have advantages over another. Therefore, choice among available modalities is preference-sensitive, with consideration of quality of life, life goals, clinical characteristics, family or care-partner support, and living environment. Ideally, individuals, their care-partners, and their healthcare teams will employ shared decision-making in assessing initial and subsequent kidney failure treatment options. To meet this goal, iterative, high-quality education and support for healthcare professionals, patients, and care-partners are priorities. Everyone who faces dialysis should have access to home therapy. Facilitating universal access to home dialysis and expanding utilization requires alignment of policy considerations and resources at the dialysis-center level, with clear leadership from informed and motivated clinical teams.

The treatment of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD with peritoneal dialysis (PD) continues to increase. Timely initiation of PD is dependent on successful PD catheter placement, which can be performed using open or laparoscopic surgical or percutaneous techniques. Dialysis access surgeons who incorporate PD catheter insertion in their practice can uniquely offer comprehensive access services to their patients. This review discusses the various methods of PD catheter insertion, patient conditions that impact surgical decision-making, and the management of catheter-related complications.

### Will peritoneal dialysis be left behind? [^cba9d7fc]. Seminars in Dialysis (2005). Low credibility.

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) enjoyed huge growth in the 1980s, followed by a rapid decline in the late 1990s, and a now persistently low utilization rate in many countries, including the United States. Recent clinical data indicate a survival advantage for patients started on PD. Residual renal function is better preserved with PD. Adequacy targets are being revised and will likely allow PD prescriptions to be simplified. The physiology of the peritoneum is better understood and treatment strategies reflect that understanding. New solutions have been developed in response to studies that have assessed the impact of conventional PD dialysate on the structure and function of the peritoneum. A remaining challenge is to ensure that nephrology trainees and nephrologists in practice are fully informed of the advantages of PD for many patients and of the advances in the therapy. If this can be achieved, PD should start to grow again.

INTRODUCTION

Setting the scene

Despite the significant progress made in understanding chronic kidney disease (CKD) and uraemic pathophysiology including premature ageing, use of advanced technology and implementation of new strategies in renal replacement therapy, the clinical outcomes of chronic kidney disease 5 dialysis patients remain suboptimal. Annual crude mortality ranges between 14 and 16% in the western world, being similar to colon cancer, while hospitalization rates are 3–5 times higher, accounting for 7–9 days/patient/year compared with the non-CKD patient. Cardiovascular events are the leading causes of this mortality, accounting for 50–60% of death causes. Patient experience remains a challenge, and quality of life is reduced and disease burden is of major importance when compared with age-matched general populations. These challenges for patients, physicians, care givers and health authorities require continual analysis to improve the societal and economic burden of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) management. These concerns were recently highlighted with a strong call for moving away from a 'one-size-fits-all' approach to dialysis and providing more personalized care that incorporates patient goals and preferences while still incorporating best practices of quality and safe therapy.

Renal replacement therapy represents the overall management of ESKD patients with three layers as shown in Figure 1: the first layer is the blood purification that consists of repetitive dialysis sessions as the basic element integrated in to a treatment schedule; the second layer is the dialysis patient management from a long-term perspective, supported by a medical strategy and defined targets; the third layer is the disease management to provide optimal care to the majority of patients. We believe renal replacement therapy may be optimized to improve a patient's outcome with a focus on cardiovascular protection in the context of personalizing the therapeutic prescription. Due to space limitation, while recognizing the value of peritoneal dialysis (PD), in this review we concentrate on future progress of extracorporeal therapies [e.g. haemodialysis and haemodiafiltration (HDF)] to reduce cardiac burden. The advances in and future of PD will be treated in another chapter. In the same perspective, some interesting features and future development of haemodialysis (e.g. home haemodialysis, daily dialysis and green dialysis) will not be treated here.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on peritoneal dialysis in adults and children [^42e3dd4a]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

These guidelines cover the organisation and performance of peritoneal dialysis as a treatment for kidney patients, including infants and children. It includes prevention and treatment of complications. It does not include factors involved in the choice of peritoneal dialysis compared to other options for patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease. This document is intended for use by any member of the health care team engaged in the care of kidney patients treated with peritoneal dialysis.

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is long established as a major option for renal replacement therapy in patients with end-stage renal disease. It is an important part of an integrated service for renal replacement therapy that is frequently selected by patients as their preferred initial mode of therapy and is a therapeutic option for patients wishing or needing to swap from HD and after renal transplant failure. PD is the best option for infants and small children. NICE Clinical Guideline 125 (2011) recommends PD as the initial dialysis treatment of choice of chronic kidney disease stage 5 for children aged 2 years or older, people with residual renal function and adults without significant associated comorbidities.

For the first time, this Renal Association guideline includes recommendations relating to PD in children. Recommendations in this guideline will refer to both adult and paediatric patients, except where the recommendation specifies one of these patient groups or provides alternative recommendations to them.

This guideline is an update of the PD module published on-line on the Renal Association website, in 2010. The English language literature was searched in December 2016 to identify relevant articles on PD published between 2008 and 2016 including:
Medline search using 'peritoneal dialysis' combined with relevant terms from each of the sections - Equipment & Resources, Training & Catheter Insertion, Dialysis Clearance, Ultrafiltration & Overhydration, Infections, Peritonitis, Exit Site Infections, Renal Osteodystrophy & Diabetes Mellitus, Encapsulating Peritoneal Sclerosis, Assisted Peritoneal Dialysis, Icodextrin, Peritoneal Membrane, Urgent Start and Biocompatible Solutions
Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews
Review of other national/international PD clinical guidelines
Identification of further articles quoted in identified papers
Review of Peritoneal Dialysis International's table of contents for articles relating to the content of the guidelines
Searches within the major renal journals (Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation, Kidney International, American Journal of Kidney Diseases) for articles with 'peritoneal dialysis' in the title/abstract

The recommendations in this guideline have been harmonised with other PD guidelines whenever possible and the recommendations to follow international PD or other Renal Association guidelines have not been graded.

### The kidney disease: improving global outcomes website: comparison of guidelines as a tool for harmonization [^1b621c2f]. Kidney International (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide public health problem with significant comorbidity and mortality. Improving quality of life and survival of CKD patients necessitates a large number of preventive and therapeutic interventions. To resolve these issues several organizations have developed guidelines, which are difficult to compare comprehensively. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes website at http://kdigo.org compares five major guidelines. The section 'compare guidelines' covers 41 topics distributed over five major subjects: (1) general clinics; (2) hemodialysis (HD); (3) vascular access for HD; (4) peritoneal dialysis; and (5) chemistries. The tables compare guideline recommendations and the evidence levels on which they are based, with direct links to each of the guidelines. These data show that the different guideline groups tend to propose similar targets, but that nuances in the guideline statements, their rationale, and grading of evidence levels present some discrepancies, although most guidelines are based on the same literature. We conclude that there is an urgent need to harmonize existing guidelines, and for a global initiative to avoid the parallel development of conflicting guidelines on the same topics. The tables displayed on the website offer a basis for structuring this process, a procedure which has recently been initiated by a body composed of the five guideline development groups.

### Urgent-start peritoneal dialysis versus conventional-start peritoneal dialysis for people with chronic kidney disease [^179e2232]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Urgent-start peritoneal dialysis (PD), defined as initiation of PD within two weeks of catheter insertion, has been emerging as an alternative mode of dialysis initiation for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) requiring urgent dialysis without established permanent dialysis access. Recently, several small studies have reported comparable patient outcomes between urgent-start and conventional-start PD.

Objectives

To examine the benefits and harms of urgent-start PD compared with conventional-start PD in adults and children with CKD requiring long-term kidney replacement therapy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 25 May 2020 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov. For non-randomised controlled trials, MEDLINE (OVID) (1946 to 27 June 2019), EMBASE (OVID) (1980 to 27 June 2019), Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov (up to 27 June 2019) were searched.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs comparing the outcomes of urgent-start PD (within 2 weeks of catheter insertion) and conventional-start PD (≥ 2 weeks of catheter insertion) treatment in children and adults CKD patients requiring long-term dialysis were included. Studies without a control group were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted and quality of studies were examined by two independent authors. The authors contacted investigators for additional information. Summary estimates of effect were examined using random-effects model and results were presented as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) as appropriate for the data. The certainty of evidence for individual outcome was assessed using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

A total of 16 studies (2953 participants) were included in this review, which included one multicentre RCT (122 participants) and 15 non-RCTs (2831 participants): 13 cohort studies (2671 participants) and 2 case-control studies (160 participants). The review included unadjusted data for analyses due to paucity of studies reporting adjusted data. In low certainty evidence, urgent-start PD may increase dialysate leak (1 RCT, 122 participants: RR 3.90, 95% CI 1.56 to 9.78) compared with conventional-start PD which translated into an absolute number of 210 more leaks per 1000 (95% CI 40 to 635). In very low certainty evidence, it is uncertain whether urgent-start PD increases catheter blockage (4 cohort studies, 1214 participants: RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.40 to 4.43; 2 case-control studies, 160 participants: RR 1.89, 95% CI 0.58 to 6.13), catheter malposition (6 cohort studies, 1353 participants: RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.80 to 3.32; 1 case-control study, 104 participants: RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.64 to 13.96), and PD dialysate flow problems (3 cohort studies, 937 participants: RR 1.44, 95% CI 0.34 to 6.14) compared to conventional-start PD. In very low certainty evidence, it is uncertain whether urgent-start PD increases exit-site infection (2 cohort studies, 337 participants: RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.24 to 8.61; 1 case-control study, 104 participants RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.41 to 3.50), exit-site bleeding (1 RCT, 122 participants: RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.03 to 16.81; 1 cohort study, 27 participants: RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.07 to 35.32), peritonitis (7 cohort studies, 1497 participants: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.46; 2 case-control studies, participants: RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.12 to 9.51), catheter readjustment (2 cohort studies, 739 participants: RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.40 to 4.02), or reduces technique survival (1 RCT, 122 participants: RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.20; 8 cohort studies, 1668 participants: RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.07; 2 case-control studies, 160 participants: RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.06). In very low certainty evidence, it is uncertain whether urgent-start PD compared with conventional-start PD increased death (any cause) (1 RCT, 122 participants: RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.87 to 2.53; 7 cohort studies, 1509 participants: RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.3; 1 case-control study, 104 participants: RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.27 to 3.02; very low certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported on tunnel tract infection.

Authors' Conclusions

In patients with CKD who require dialysis urgently without ready-to-use dialysis access in place, urgent-start PD may increase the risk of dialysate leak and has uncertain effects on catheter blockage, malposition or readjustment, PD dialysate flow problems, infectious complications, exit-site bleeding, technique survival, and patient survival compared with conventional-start PD.

Background

Over 70 million individuals worldwide have Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) making it a pressing global health concern that is placing increased strain on health care resources related to CKD care. The prevalence of CKD stages 1 to 4 has increased dramatically from 10% in 1988–1994 to 13% in 1999–2004 in the United States and 12.5% (representing 3 million adults) from 2007 to 2009 in Canada. These higher rates of chronic disease may also lead to adverse outcomes and end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation. Globally, approximately 190,000 patients regularly received peritoneal dialysis (PD) which is usually performed at home daily by the patient after receiving education and training by a dialysis health care professional. PD has been associated with a survival advantage, especially in the first few years of therapy; is the least costly of all the forms of dialysis (e.g. in Canada it has been recently estimated that maintaining a patient on PD compared to hemodialysis saves the healthcare system over $150,000 over a three year period; and higher levels of satisfaction with care than patients receiving hemodialysis; and higher health-related quality of life (HrQOL) scores.

Regardless of treatment for CKD, care is complex and requires significant personal involvement to integrate medication adherence, lifestyle modification and nutritional adaptation into a daily routine. CKD patients are often not satisfied with their communication with their health care providers and are frequently unaware of their diagnosis or its implications. This may be due in part to the volume of CKD patients which have resulted in nephrologists seeing more patients in less time. Simultaneously, alternative methods of communication are being developed and embraced by a population with growing computer literacy. Emerging new technological solutions including the variety of applications and portals for health information are offering patients a better understanding of their diseases and evidence informed practice.

One emerging technological solution is telehomecare, which refers to a model of care using information, communications, measurement and monitoring technologies to enable healthcare providers to link with patients at home. Telehomecare has been associated with reduced risk of disease and other health-related problems and improved recovery in other patient populations. Specific examples include less symptoms and fewer hospitalizations for persons with heart failure, increased compliance rates and feedback in cardiac rehabilitation patients, and improved quality of life indicators in the pediatric palliative care population. Further, telehomecare can reduce costs associated with improved coordination, continuity of care, and access to specialized care.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for hemodialysis adequacy: 2015 update [^869b9fe6]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Guideline 1.1 — kidney replacement therapy (KRT) initiation and modality choice emphasizes shared decision-making and preservation of options: Guideline 1.1 specifically includes those who have initiated KRT for kidney failure, and whenever possible, the timing of presentation should not limit the treatment options for kidney failure. Although logistically, hemodialysis (HD) is easiest to implement, peritoneal dialysis (PD) and conservative care are important options, and dialysis should not be initiated without ensuring that a shared decision-making process among patients, their families and care-givers, and their physicians. The Work Group noted that the purpose of dialysis is not solely prolongation of life but rather promotion of living, and it is essential that dialysis initiation or the decision to forgo KRT be an individualized process that incorporates eliciting patient goals and life preferences, prognosis, and expected benefits and burdens associated with kidney failure and its treatment, followed by guidance and decision support regarding the therapies that can offer the patient the greatest likelihood of achieving their goals within their preference structure.

### Will incremental hemodialysis preserve residual function and improve patient survival? [^4bd27d57]. Seminars in Dialysis (2014). Low credibility.

Most patients embark on hemodialysis with some degree of residual renal function. Its preservation is strongly associated with patient and technique survival for peritoneal dialysis patients. Comparative studies have suggested that initiating treatment with peritoneal dialysis offers patients a survival advantage over hemodialysis in the short term. In most centers, patients treated by hemodialysis loose residual renal function more rapidly than those on peritoneal dialysis, and as such there has been renewed interest in how patients initiate hemodialysis and whether practice techniques influence loss of residual renal function.

In the United States, payment for chronic hemodialysis treatments are linked to achieving a defined dose of dialysis, in terms of urea clearance (Kt/V), and this has led to the practice of starting patients on thrice weekly treatments designed to achieve the target Kt/V, irrespective of residual renal function. It has been questioned as to whether this approach might lead to a more rapid loss of residual renal function by reducing the drive to hyperfiltration of the remaining functioning nephrons. As such there has been renewed interest in initiating hemodialysis as an adjuvant to residual renal function, akin to incremental peritoneal dialysis.

Although a practioner of incremental hemodialysis, I believe there are a number of factors that need some consideration. Firstly, the greatest risk for death for hemodialysis patients is in the first 90 days after transition from nondialysis dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) to dialysis. Indeed, mortality in this period can be much greater for those initiating hemodialysis compared to stage 5 CKD patients opting for conservative nondialysis care. The majority of studies which have investigated transitioning to dialysis have shown that mortality is predominantly associated with underlying patient co-morbidity and lack of predialysis specialist nephrological care. This would suggest that the patient trajectory is an important determinant of outcome, as patients starting hemodialysis precipitously following an acute deterioration in renal function on a background of CKD — (such as following an acute coronary syndrome or development of cast nephropathy) have much higher mortality rates than those with slower progressive trajectories. The alternative scenario, CKD patients attending specialist nephrology clinics, shows no benefit from earlier compared to later initiation of dialysis.

KDIGO 2024 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is an update to the KDIGO 2012 guideline, aiming to assist clinicians caring for people with CKD, both adults and children, while stating that people receiving dialysis and kidney transplant recipients are not the focus of this guideline. The scope includes chapters on the evaluation of CKD, risk assessment in people with CKD, management to delay CKD progression and manage its complications, medical management and drug stewardship in CKD, and optimal models of CKD care, and it also includes a comprehensive introduction, a patient foreword, special population considerations, a presentation of the relative and absolute risks from the CKD Prognosis Consortium (CKD-PC), and a section with research recommendations based on current evidence gaps. The goal is to generate a useful resource for clinicians and patients by providing actionable recommendations based on a rigorous formal evidence review, practice points for areas without a systematic review, and useful infographics, and it targets a broad audience of healthcare providers and people with CKD while being mindful of implications for policy and payment. Development followed an explicit process of evidence review and appraisal; treatment approaches and recommendations are based on systematic reviews with appraisal using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, and limitations of the evidence with areas for future research are presented.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: update of anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^606cba9c]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Anaemia is common in chronic kidney disease (CKD) encompassing non-dialysis dependent CKD (NDD-CKD) and dialysis dependent CKD (DD-CKD); people on peritoneal dialysis (PD) and haemodialysis (HD); and kidney transplant recipients (KTR). Iron deficiency and erythropoietin deficiency are the most common causes of anaemia in people with CKD, especially those requiring kidney replacement therapy (KRT). The Renal National Service Framework and National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the UK, and Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), all advocate treatment of anaemia in people with CKD. Blood transfusions are infrequently required, and newer therapies such as Hypoxia-Inducible Factor (HIF-PHI) stabilisers are now in current use. This guideline provides evidence based graded practice guidance on the use of iron; comments on iron deficiency without anaemia in people with CKD; provide further information on anaemia management in people with a transplant and provide guidance in the use of the new HIF-PHI drugs. It also provides audit and research recommendations.

### Management options for an older adult with advanced chronic kidney disease and dementia: grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^b6dede08]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

About 15% of adults in the United States-37 million persons-have chronic kidney disease (CKD). Chronic kidney disease is divided into 5 groups, ranging from stage 1 to stage 5 CKD, whereas end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is defined as permanent kidney failure. The treatment options for ESKD are kidney replacement therapy (KRT) and conservative management. The options for KRT include hemodialysis (either in-center or at home), peritoneal dialysis, and kidney transplant. Conservative management, a multidisciplinary model of care for patients with stage 5 CKD who want to avoid dialysis, is guided by patient values, preferences, and goals, with a focus on quality of life and symptom management. In 2015, the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative recommended that patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate below 30 mL/min/1.73 m² be educated about options for both KRT and conservative management. In 2018, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommended that assessment for KRT or conservative management start at least 1 year before the need for therapy. It also recommended that in choosing a management approach, predicted quality of life, predicted life expectancy, patient preferences, and other patient factors be considered, because little difference in outcomes has been found among options. Here, 2 experts-a nephrologist and a general internist-palliative care physician-reflect on the care of a patient with advanced CKD and mild to moderate dementia. They discuss the management options for patients with advanced CKD, the pros and cons of each method, and how to help a patient choose among the options.

Clinical utility of PROMs in PD — use in practice and supplemental assessment is characterized by the statement that "Although endorsing statement 3a of the ISPD guideline, the KDOQI work group acknowledges that it remains a vexing challenge to determine how to use information obtained from measurement of health-related quality of life among individuals treated with PD to improve clinical care and decision making". Given regulatory and reimbursement imperatives, "most individuals treated with PD in the United States will continue to be administered the KDQOL-36 and depression screening annually", yet the work group "supports enhanced assessment of health-related quality of life, symptoms, and treatment burden among persons treated with PD through nephrologist-led questioning in the course of monthly comprehensive assessments and consideration of administration of additional PROMs to supplement the KDQOL-36". The group states that "Currently, there is insufficient evidence to endorse the use of 1 or more specific PROMs for individuals undergoing PD", identifies domains "beyond symptoms" including "life participation, work and home schedules, travel, and physician visit considerations", and advises that "Clinicians should also be mindful to incorporate nondialysis interventions in the management of symptom burden, including general medical and behavioral treatments for erectile dysfunction, depression, pruritus, headaches, and others".

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) G4–G5ND/G5D — HCV therapy with direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens is supported as follows: we recommend treatment of HCV in patients with CKD G4–G5ND and G5D with a RBV-free DAA-based regimen, and SOF/DCV, SOF/LDV, and SOF/VEL have been shown to be safe and effective in patients with CKD G4–G5, with or without dialysis. No evidence of a deleterious effect of other DAAs on eGFR has been reported with non-SOF–based regimens, and one study reported a small improvement in mean GFR (1.6 ml/min per 1.73 m²; 95% CI: –0.1 to 3.3) after treatment with a SOF and VEL regimen. In Europe and the US, labeling for SOF has been expanded to include patients with severe renal impairment and those on hemodialysis, and for peritoneal dialysis our systematic review found no evidence to recommend specific DAA regimens, but it is reasonable to follow guidance for patients on hemodialysis; guidance is in overall concordance with AASLD and EASL, with advice to consult these resources for up-to-date management information.

### Effects of different peritoneal dialysis solutions on serum lipid levels and lipid profile in end-stage chronic kidney disease patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis [^4fca7209]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined by persistent abnormalities in kidney function or structure with significant health consequences. CKD is characterized as a persistent abnormality in kidney structure or function lasting more than three months (e.g. glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² or ≥ 30 mg albuminuria per 24 h) and affects 8–16% of the global population. In the United States alone, CKD affects more than 20 million individuals, with over 500,000 suffering from end-stage renal disease (ESRD). By 2040, CKD is projected to be the fifth leading cause of years of life lost worldwide. The most common causes of CKD are diabetes and hypertension. CKD is a major global health concern and an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, cognitive dysfunction, hospitalization, and all-cause mortality. As CKD progresses to ESRD, patients face significantly increased risks of death and require renal replacement therapy (RRT), most commonly hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis (PD).

PD offers several advantages such as flexibility, improved quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. Currently, more than 3.5 million people worldwide, including approximately 540,000 in the U.S. receive maintenance dialysis, with a five-year survival rate of about 40%. Advances in PD have reduced complications and allowed longer use, while insights into peritoneal transport mechanisms have opened new avenues for therapeutic optimization. Nevertheless, cardiovascular risk and lipid metabolism disturbances remain major clinical concerns in PD patients.

Even at mild levels of kidney failure, independent of traditional risk factors, the risk of cardiovascular disease is increased, reaching its peak in ESRD patients requiring dialysis. One of the most critical pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to cardiovascular disease in CKD patients is the widespread and potentially accelerated formation of atherosclerotic plaques due to hyperlipidemia, uremic toxins, inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction. Various aspects of serum lipid profiles and HDL metabolism, including their structure and function, can be significantly altered in patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria or CKD. These abnormalities contribute to cardiovascular complications, foam cell formation, atherosclerosis, and/or glomerulosclerosis in affected patients. While dyslipidemia plays a significant role in cardiovascular disease development in CKD patients, the composition of dialysis solutions directly influences lipid metabolism in PD patients.

### Patient and treatment characteristics associated with patient activation in patients undergoing hemodialysis: a cross-sectional study [^25f7c76e]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as structural or functional abnormalities of the kidneys, present for more than three months. When renal function further deteriorates, patients develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with need for renal replacement therapy, i.e. hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or renal transplantation.

The number of patients in need for a renal replacement therapy is increasing rapidly. In the United States in 2013, the prevalent dialysis population consisted of 466,607 patients. This population has increased by 63.2% since 2000. On the other hand, dialysis treatments are very expensive. Hence, along with the increasing population, the cost of providing dialysis and transplantation continue to escalate.

One way to influence health-care costs on the long-term could be to focus on patient activation. Driven by the person-centered approach, patient activation specifies the level of patients' involvement with their health care and refers to the extent to which they have the knowledge, belief, motivation, confidence, and skills to manage a chronic disease. There is a growing body of literature indicating that activated patients make more effective use of healthcare services, have better self-management behaviors, better patient outcomes, better care experiences, and lower health-care costs in chronic patients. Hence, to enhance patient outcomes at lower costs, the level of activation should be optimized.

Peritonitis is a common serious complication of peritoneal dialysis that results in considerable morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. It also significantly limits the use of this important dialysis modality. Despite its importance as a patient safety issue, peritonitis practices and outcomes vary markedly and unacceptably among different centers, regions, and countries. This article reviews peritonitis risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, particularly focusing on potential drivers of variable practices and outcomes, controversial or unresolved areas, and promising avenues warranting further research. Potential strategies for augmenting the existing limited evidence base and reducing the gap between evidence-based best practice and actual practice also are discussed.

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) toxin removal — small-solute clearance targets and monitoring: Removal of toxins may be estimated using Kt/Vurea and/or creatinine clearance, and there is no high-quality evidence regarding the need or benefit associated with a specific target value; the best evidence to date indicates no evidence for a clinically meaningful benefit to intensifying the PD prescription to achieve total Kt/Vurea higher than 1.7. The KDOQI work group stresses that clinicians should follow up patients closely if the delivered dose is below that studied in randomized trials, namely a weekly Kt/V less than 1.7, and notes that recommendation 3d focuses on small-solute clearance to the exclusion of other potential uremic toxins, including molecules of middle molecular weight and protein-bound toxins. There is also no high-quality evidence that incremental PD in those with residual kidney function either improves or worsens mortality, symptoms, or health-related quality of life, and the KDOQI work group suggests that providers closely monitor for uremic symptoms, fluid overload, and protein-energy wasting.

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) has various causes that may differ according to country and racial group. Whatever the cause, unless the water, salt, electrolytes, and waste products excreted by normal kidneys are removed, their accumulation will result in death. Removal of these products can be variably achieved by either hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. The principles and outcomes of these techniques are described, as are their complications. It is important that these two different methods of treatment are not regarded as competitive, but are integrated, together with renal transplantation where appropriate, into the management of patients with ESRD to optimize both outcome and quality of life.

### Residual kidney function: implications in the era of personalized medicine [^d19d0ecc]. Seminars in Dialysis (2017). Low credibility.

The association of residual kidney function (RKF) with improved outcomes in peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis patients is now widely recognized. RKF provides substantial volume and solute clearance even after dialysis initiation. In particular, RKF provides clearance of nonurea solutes, many of which are potential uremic toxins and not effectively removed by conventional hemodialysis. The presence of RKF provides a distinct advantage to incident dialysis patients and is an opportunity for nephrologists to individualize dialysis treatments tailored to their patients' unique solute, volume, and quality of life needs. The benefits of RKF present the opportunity to personalize the management of uremia.

Outcomes reported in randomized controlled trials in peritoneal dialysis (PD) are diverse, are measured inconsistently, and may not be important to patients, families, and clinicians. The Standardized Outcomes in Nephrology-Peritoneal Dialysis (SONG-PD) initiative aims to establish a core outcome set for trials in PD based on the shared priorities of all stakeholders. We convened an international SONG-PD stakeholder consensus workshop in May 2018 in Vancouver, Canada. Nineteen patients/caregivers and 51 health professionals attended. Participants discussed core outcome domains and implementation in trials in PD. Four themes relating to the formation of core outcome domains were identified: life participation as a main goal of PD, impact of fatigue, empowerment for preparation and planning, and separation of contributing factors from core factors. Considerations for implementation were identified: standardizing patient-reported outcomes, requiring a validated and feasible measure, simplicity of binary outcomes, responsiveness to interventions, and using positive terminology. All stakeholders supported inclusion of PD-related infection, cardiovascular disease, mortality, technique survival, and life participation as the core outcome domains for PD.

RENAL REPLACEMENT THERAPY

RRT terminology and initiation

In recent years, the suggestion has been made that the English term "renal" should be replaced by "kidney", because the latter is more familiar to most English speakers. Additionally, the term "replacement" may not be sufficient, and terms such as "support" or "partial replacement" may be more accurate. The implications of changes in nomenclature are not insignificant. Additionally, the distinction between kidney versus renal does not apply in all languages. Accordingly, KDIGO has convened a separate Nomenclature Consensus Conference for the purpose of recommending nomenclature consistent with guidelines for acute and chronic kidney disease. Above all, patients should be the focus of all communication and care. Whenever possible, all decisions about treatment should be shared with patients, their families and/or next of kin, and if required, all members of the end-of-life care multidisciplinary team. All communication with patients and their supporting families/friends should be provided in simple lay language at regular intervals, with the awareness that patients may be traumatized. "Life support", "kidney machine", or similar words are preferred to the term RRT. If RRT becomes permanent, and the patient enters the chronic dialysis pathway, all relevant medical or nursing personnel should change their language to specify the type of RRT (transplant, hemodialysis, or peritoneal dialysis).

### The importance of residual kidney function for patients on dialysis: a critical review [^e7c50bfc]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Increasing the dialysis dose has failed to have an impact on the mortality of dialysis patients. In contrast, residual kidney function (RKF) has consistently been a potent predictor of improved survival for both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients. The benefits of RKF preservation challenge historical concepts of dialysis adequacy that have focused principally on achieving small-solute clearance targets. In this review, we highlight the evidence supporting the impact of RKF on survival and quality of life of dialysis patients and provide a mechanistic framework for this relationship. Current strategies to preserve RKF also are reviewed, emphasizing those used in patients treated with peritoneal dialysis.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^5571413c]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Early versus late referral outcomes — systematic review results indicate early referral is associated with higher receipt of permanent vascular access (RR: 3.22; 95% CI: 2.92–3.55) and initiation of KRT with peritoneal dialysis (RR: 1.74; 95% CI: 1.64–1.84), and with lower three-month mortality (OR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.55–0.67) and five-month mortality (OR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.60–0.71); mean differences favored early referral for Initial hospitalization (d) −9.1; 95% CI: −10.92 to −7.32, Systolic blood pressure (mm Hg) −3.09; 95% CI: −5.23 to −0.95, and Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg) −1.64; 95% CI: −2.77 to −0.51.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic kidney disease in patients infected with HIV: 2014 update by the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^339e32e5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Zidovudine — renal dosing for adults with HIV and chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD): Usual dosage is 300 mg po bid. For CrCl ≥ 15 mL/min, no adjustment. For CrCl < 15 mL/min, hemodialysis, or peritoneal dialysis, use 100 mg po q6–8h or 300 mg qd, with the comment that this is based on longer intracellular half-life.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^623eca3b]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Dialysis modality choice and residual kidney function (RKF) — the Work Group encourages PD (peritoneal dialysis) as a first choice of modality for patients initiating KRT as a means of preserving RKF; however, most patients are not candidates for self-dialysis outside of a clinic, thus HD (hemodialysis) remains the most common initial modality choice for new patients, and the same attention that is given to RKF in PD patients should be directed to the much larger group of HD patients.

### KDIGO 2025 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation, management, and treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) [^4fa33668]. Kidney International (2025). High credibility.

ADPKD kidney failure — dialysis modality selection emphasizes shared decision-making: Choice of dialysis modality should be determined based on shared decision-making between physician and patient. We suggest that in people with ADPKD, selection of dialysis modality (hemodialysis [HD] or peritoneal dialysis [PD]) for treatment of kidney failure should be determined by patient-related factors, patient choice, and availability of facilities (2C). Peritoneal dialysis should be considered as a viable kidney replacement therapy (KRT) for people with ADPKD complicated by kidney failure, with caution indicated only when massive kidney and/or liver enlargement or other standard PD contraindications are present. The prescription of HD and supportive therapies, such as anticoagulation, should be the same as that for people without ADPKD.
