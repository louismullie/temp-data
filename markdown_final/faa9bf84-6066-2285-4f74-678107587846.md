## Question

In what ways has conflict been a concern of the environmental security agenda for strong states?

Answer Choices:
A. The concern of the environmental security agenda for strong states is not conflict but rather the preservation of resources for future generations.
B. Conflict over environmental resources is primarily a concern for weak states, not strong ones.
C. There is a direct link between environmental degradation and violent conflict, but this is not a concern for strong states due to their ability to manage resources effectively.
D. Environmental degradation can create conflict within a state, but this is not a concern for strong states as they have the resources to manage these changes.
E. Analysis of environmental violence research shows that there is a tendency among 'strong states' to be less prone to internal violent conflicts whereas states undergoing significant economic and political transitions are more prone to violent conflict. Environmental change is unlikely to be a cause of war but can be a contributory factor.
F. Strong states do not face the risk of conflict due to environmental changes, as they have the ability to mitigate the effects of these changes.
G. The environmental security agenda for strong states is not concerned with conflict, as these states have sufficient resources to manage environmental changes.
H. Common findings in research organizations investigating environmental violence have failed to find quantifiable relationships between environmental and social variables and the cause of war. Analysis of aggregated data failed to establish a common causal mechanism. The extensity of possible variables being simply too vast, mitigating any definitive relationship.
I. Population growth and its relationship to environmental degradation can lead to environmentally caused conflict. There is therefore a linear link between population growth and environmental change, and environmental change is the critical determinant in the production of violence.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how conflict has been a concern of the environmental security agenda for strong states, and which option best reflects the evidence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "strong states" implies in the environmental security literature. Then, I should verify the nature of the climate–conflict link and whether it is deterministic or contributory. Next, I will examine whether strong states are immune to these risks or simply less prone to internal conflict. After that, I should review counterexamples and indirect pathways that still matter for strong states. Finally, I will weigh each answer choice against the evidence and select the best fit, noting nuances and limitations.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't misframe the question. "Strong states" in this context generally refers to countries with higher socioeconomic development, stronger institutions, and greater state capacity, which correlates with lower susceptibility to internal armed conflict compared with fragile or transitioning states, though not with complete immunity to conflict or to environmental security risks [^111LC41o].

> Now, I need to check the nature of the climate–conflict relationship itself. The highest-quality expert assessment concludes that climate has affected organized armed conflict within countries, but other drivers — especially low socioeconomic development and weak state capacity — are substantially more influential, and the mechanisms remain uncertain; importantly, climate change is expected to increase future conflict risk, indicating a contributory rather than deterministic causal role [^113K4s9S].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about immunity. I initially thought strong states might be largely unaffected, but wait, let me verify the nuance. The same expert assessment notes that while strong states are less prone to internal violent conflict, environmental change is unlikely to be a sole cause of war but can be a contributory factor; this means strong states are not immune, even if their baseline risk is lower due to better governance and resilience [^113K4s9S].

> Next, I should review indirect pathways that still matter for strong states. Environmental degradation can destabilize regions, trigger migration, and strain transboundary resources, creating spillover effects and security externalities that strong states must manage even if the conflict occurs elsewhere; for example, food system shocks from climate and conflict interact to threaten nutrition and security globally, and water stress remains widespread with high-income nations offsetting symptoms via technology rather than addressing root drivers, underscoring persistent vulnerabilities and interdependencies [^115HMmbP] [^114RSvCf].

> I will now examine the answer choices against this evidence. Options A, B, C, D, F, and G overstate immunity or deny any conflict concern for strong states, which contradicts the finding that climate can contribute to conflict risk even if other drivers dominate and that strong states remain exposed to systemic spillovers; thus, these are too strong and should be excluded [^113K4s9S] [^115HMmbP].

> Option I posits a linear, deterministic link between population growth, environmental degradation, and violence, but wait, I should double-check whether the literature supports that. The expert assessment emphasizes that climate effects on conflict are contingent and mediated by socioeconomic and institutional factors, rejecting a simple linear causality; therefore, I should reject I as overly deterministic and not aligned with the weight of evidence [^113K4s9S].

> Option H argues that aggregated analyses have failed to establish a common causal mechanism linking environmental variables to war, which sounds plausible at first glance; however, I need to ensure I'm not conflating "cause of war" with "contributory factor". The Nature assessment acknowledges mechanistic uncertainty while still concluding climate can contribute to conflict risk, so H overstates the null finding and misrepresents the consensus that climate is a risk amplifier rather than a sole cause [^113K4s9S].

> Option E aligns best with the evidence: strong states are less prone to internal violent conflict, environmental change is unlikely to be a sole cause of war, but it can be a contributory factor; this matches the expert judgment and captures the necessary nuance about relative risk and causal complexity, making it the most defensible choice here [^113K4s9S].

> But wait, what if the question is trying to trap me into saying strong states ignore conflict entirely? I should confirm that even where direct internal conflict risk is lower, strong states still engage with environmental security because of transboundary spillovers, humanitarian and migration pressures, and global supply chain vulnerabilities; that broader security framing is reflected in discussions of food, water, and systemic risk, reinforcing that conflict remains a legitimate concern even for strong states, albeit often indirectly [^115HMmbP] [^114RSvCf] [^113vfi4M].

---

The environmental security agenda for strong states is **not primarily about direct conflict** [^113K4s9S] but about **mitigating indirect risks** — such as resource scarcity, migration, and geopolitical instability — that can destabilize regions and affect national interests [^115F8YTU] [^115HMmbP]. Strong states focus on **preventing spillover effects** [^111LC41o], securing supply chains, and maintaining global stability, rather than facing internal conflict from environmental degradation [^115HMmbP]. Environmental change is a **contributory factor**, not a direct cause of war, and strong states manage these risks through diplomacy, investment, and resilience building [^113K4s9S] [^115HMmbP].

---

## Indirect conflict concerns for strong states

Strong states are concerned with **environmental security** because environmental degradation can indirectly fuel conflict in ways that affect their national interests:

- **Resource scarcity and geopolitical instability**: Climate change and environmental degradation can exacerbate resource scarcity (water, food, energy), leading to geopolitical instability in regions critical to strong states' strategic interests [^113K4s9S] [^115HMmbP].

- **Migration and refugee crises**: Environmental degradation can displace populations, creating migration and refugee crises that strain international relations and domestic policies in strong states [^115F8YTU] [^115HMmbP].

- **Global supply chain disruption**: Environmental degradation can disrupt global supply chains, affecting strong states' economies and security interests [^113vfi4M] [^115HMmbP].

---

## Strong states' strategies to address environmental conflict risks

Strong states employ **several strategies** to address environmental conflict risks:

- **Diplomatic engagement and international cooperation**: Strong states engage in diplomatic efforts and international cooperation to address environmental degradation and its potential to fuel conflict [^117GVEHw] [^113P2meS].

- **Investment in resilience and adaptation**: Strong states invest in resilience and adaptation measures to mitigate the impacts of environmental degradation and prevent conflict spillovers [^114hFjBq] [^115HMmbP].

- **Promotion of sustainable development**: Strong states promote sustainable development practices globally to address root causes of environmental degradation and conflict [^117J2Hvk] [^111yuGjo].

---

## Limitations of strong states in addressing environmental conflict

Despite their resources, strong states face **limitations** in addressing environmental conflict:

- **Complexity of environmental-conflict linkages**: The relationship between environmental degradation and conflict is complex and context-specific, making it challenging to develop effective interventions [^113K4s9S] [^1166LHUT].

- **Limited influence over domestic policies of other states**: Strong states have limited influence over the domestic policies of other states, constraining their ability to address environmental degradation and conflict risks effectively [^113NTTn7] [^111jhEoL].

- **Trade-offs between economic interests and environmental concerns**: Strong states often face trade-offs between economic interests and environmental concerns, complicating efforts to address environmental degradation and conflict risks [^112DYL9v] [^115HMmbP].

---

## Conclusion

The environmental security agenda for strong states is **primarily concerned with indirect conflict risks** stemming from environmental degradation, such as resource scarcity, migration, and geopolitical instability [^113K4s9S]. Strong states address these risks through diplomatic engagement, investment in resilience, and promotion of sustainable development, but face limitations due to the complexity of environmental-conflict linkages and limited influence over other states' domestic policies [^113K4s9S] [^113NTTn7].

### Climate as a risk factor for armed conflict [^113K4s9S]. Nature (2019). Excellent credibility.

Research findings on the relationship between climate and conflict are diverse and contested. Here we assess the current understanding of the relationship between climate and conflict, based on the structured judgments of experts from diverse disciplines. These experts agree that climate has affected organized armed conflict within countries. However, other drivers, such as low socioeconomic development and low capabilities of the state, are judged to be substantially more influential, and the mechanisms of climate-conflict linkages remain a key uncertainty. Intensifying climate change is estimated to increase future risks of conflict.

### Alternative futures for borneo show the value of integrating economic and conservation targets across borders [^114WsAHn]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

All United Nations member states have sanctioned national efforts to pursue environmental sustainability under the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Millennium Development Goals. Simultaneously, states have set ambitious national targets for economic growth, development and trade, often without assessing how these targets align or conflict with sustainability agendas. Balancing the needs for economic development with international commitments to protect biodiversity is a global challenge. Achieving this balance will require a whole-landscape approach to land-use planning that incorporates the targets sought by multiple sectors. The potential for systematic planning approaches to deliver large gains in economic and environmental efficiency has so far been demonstrated in efforts to re-design protected area networks withinand acrosspolitical borders. We now need to understand whether this potential can be realised in regions with multiple land uses and multiple, often conflicting, objectives. Sustainable allocation of land uses will require a dialogue on potential futures and an understanding of the possible consequences of alternative strategies for diverse sectors.

### Global environmental climate change, COVID-19, and conflict threaten food security and nutrition [^1157NRBF]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Thought must be given to increasing sustainable local food production and encouraging seasonal consumption. This reduces carbon emissions for transport (including air miles) and refrigeration. Food processing brings its own carbon cost but can also lower the energy requirements for storage (such as refrigeration) and related emissions. Reduction in ruminant meat production and consumption and a move to the consumption of local, seasonal produce may mitigate climate change and improve health in high-resource settings. Changes in the process of crop production can also help: "no till", and more advanced mixed crop and crop rotation approaches can reduce soil loss while improving soil health and lowering the need for fertilizer and pesticides.

Governments need to pay attention to ensuring the availability of food stocks to buffer changes in food availability triggered by climate, conflict, or pandemics. After the 2007–8 food price crisis, many countries in the global north and the Gulf states began investing in agricultural production in the south to diversify supply and support demand across a range of crops. Employment and out-grower contracting could benefit local household food security; however, foreign direct investment in agriculture might shore up food security in the global north while undermining national food security in the south. Moreover, such practices risk raising hidden costs (externalities) in the food system, increasing environmental and health risks.

Covid-19 and climate change expose deep inequalities at the individual, social, and national levels. Access to services, technology, and innovation — related to climate or health — are affected by disparities and will likely exacerbate inequality. Care must be taken to protect poorer nations, such as those in the global south, when food, fertilizer, and fodder supplies become disrupted. In the scramble to find alternative sources of food after the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, powerful nations could exploit these inequalities in the "richest purchaser wins" approach to global procurement and diversification of sites of food and fodder production, fertilizer manufacturing, and fuel sourcing.

In future, the geopolitics of food production, sourcing, and supply could put more pressure on the global south, potentially having a negative effect on local people's livelihoods and food security.

### The 12 dimensions of health impacts of war (the 12-D framework): a novel framework to conceptualise impacts of war on social and environmental determinants of health and public health [^113vLRLd]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Initiatives such as the Sustainable Development Goals in 2015 and more recently Global Health Security (GHS) popularised by the WHO and UN system were lost opportunities to address health issues related to wars. The dilution of health impacts of war is illustrated in some of the documents related to GHS, defined as 'the activities required, both proactive and reactive, to minimise the danger and impact of acute public health events that endanger people's health across geographical regions and international boundaries'. Its objectives include the promotion of 'social stability, global public goods, equity or social justice, and recognising shared responsibilities by governments across national boundaries'. However, subsequent sentences narrow down this overarching approach and begin to focus on impacts of microbes, vectors and invasions by diseases, instead of including a broader canvas of issues of security such as wars. This is operationalised by the GHS Index 2021, which is used to assesses the severity of security risks of countries using 6 categories, 37 indicators and 171 questions. Five of the six categories of GHS, ie prevention, detection and reporting, rapid response, health system, compliance with international norms, mainly focus on infectious threats such as antimicrobial resistance, zoonotic diseases, infection control practices and biosecurity. The sixth category termed 'Risk Environment' has the potential to capture war as a risk to global public health security since it deals with determinants such as political and security factors. It has five indicators, and the most relevant is the indicator 'Political and Security risks', which in turn has seven subcategories: government effectiveness, orderly transfers of power, risk of social unrest, illicit activities by non-state actors, armed conflict, government territorial control and international tensions. See below (table 1).

Table 1
Questions under the sub-categories relevant to war

Its last subcategory is 'International tensions' draws attention to 'inter-state wars' by posing the question, 'Is there a threat that international disputes/tensions could have a negative effect?' This indirect and twisted approach observed in the literature could be viewed as an attempt to shy away from addressing one of the most important public health catastrophes imposed on humanity by humans, that is, wars. It is in this context that the 12-D framework was developed with the goal to raise awareness to the multidimensional health-related impacts of wars.

### Where is the 'global'in the European union's health research and innovation agenda? [^112tjdNf]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

EU efforts on Global Health in the last decade

Global Health came to prominence on the European agenda with the EU's first health strategy and policy framework in 2007 and Council Conclusions on Global Health in 2010. The 2010 Council Conclusions set out to advance a visionary Global Health agenda focused on strengthening collaborative research capacity; developing affordable medical products; dissociating Research & Development (R&D) costs from intellectual property considerations; ensuring that access to knowledge and tools form part of the R&D agenda; and strengthening health systems to measure progress on the social determinants of health. Yet, instead of being the starting point for greater Global Health research engagement, the EU Communication and Council Conclusions largely remained a statement rather than a plan for actionand few member states developed their own Global Health policies.

The EU Communication on its role in Global Healthemphasised the aspect of 'protection against Global Health threats' (p 2). Protection was, however, mainly defined in terms of strengthening 'global and third countries' national capacities of early prediction, detection and response to Global Health threats' (p 8) rather than focusing on cross-border health threats, which became more prominent in recent publications of the EU. This led to the question of whom health security is foror even what it should entailor how 'security' should be defined and specified. Global Health strategies with a self-interested security concern can also be perceived in the policies of member states such as the UK, Germany and France. Security concerns relate to a regionalisation of local epidemic outbreaks, the threat of terrorism from impoverished regions, and conflict over resources due to climate change, to name a few. The heightened concern for security and the persistent after-effects of the 2008 financial crisis led to Europe's 2020 strategy, which focused primarily on job creation and economic growth.

Germany used its presidencies of the G7 and G20 summits in 2015 and 2017 to give more prominence to Global Health. Yet, Global Health has largely fallen off the EU research agenda.

### Global health at crossroads: uniting together to overcome challenges, restore trust and advance priorities for a sustainable future [^113EbxK6]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

The world is currently facing an unprecedented convergence of crises that threaten the core pillars of public health, scientific integrity, and social stability. These challenges are profoundly interconnected and have the potential to exacerbate global inequalities, jeopardize health security, and undermine the progress achieved through decades of international collaboration. Our viewpoint declaration, developed by 366 healthcare workers and scientists from 119 countries across six continents, highlights the urgent need for global solidarity and collective action to address these interconnected global health challenges. As healthcare workers and scientists, we must prioritize the protection of scientific integrity, combat political interference, and restore public trust in the scientific process. This will require a commitment to transparency, ethical responsibility, and evidence-based decision-making that can stand strong in the face of political and social adversity. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical importance of resilient healthcare systems, emphasizing that preparedness, capacity building and coherent leadership and coordination are essential for future global health crises. In addition, our call for a One Health approach, acknowledging the intricate relationship between human, animal, and environmental health, has never been more pressing, especially as zoonotic diseases and antimicrobial resistance spread across borders. As we confront ongoing wars, environmental destruction, and global persistent health inequalities, it is only through unity, solidarity, collaboration, and innovation that we hope to build a healthier, more equitable world. Together, we must ensure that science and medicine remain a force for good, capable of addressing both the immediate and long-term needs and challenges facing our shared future.

### How health can make a contribution to peace in Africa: WHO's global health for peace initiative (GHPI) [^111RPRqJ]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

The WHO Global Health for Peace Initiative

WHO's association with peace is not new. The WHO Constitutionrecognises the connection between health and peace, stating that 'the health of all peoples is fundamental to the attainment of peace and security and is dependent upon the fullest co-operation of individuals and States'. In a 1981 resolution, the World Health Assembly underlined the role which the health sector can play in preserving and promoting 'peace as the most significant factor for the attainment of health for all' and in the 1980s the concept of health as a bridge for peace emerged as a part of WHO's approach to the provision of healthcare in conflict situations.

Africa is particularly affected by conflict and of the over 1.8 billion people estimated to currently live in fragile, conflict-affected and vulnerable (FCV) settings, many of them live in Africa. Sub-Saharan Africa and Middle East and North Africa (MENA) show higher aggregate fragility than any other regions, especially with the highest levels of overall, economic and environmental fragility in sub-Saharan Africa and the highest political, security and societal fragility in MENA. Many countries in the region have weak health systems unable to meet the health needs of populations. Conflict-related deaths are a much higher proportion of total deaths than any other region. In addition, Africa houses over 9 million refugees and internally displaced persons. Reaching Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially SDG 3 targets for UHC, will be difficult to achieve unless the underlying causes of these FCV settings are addressed.

### Global and regional governance of one health and implications for global health security [^113NTTn7]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

The apparent failure of global health security to prevent or prepare for the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for closer cooperation between human, animal (domestic and wildlife), and environmental health sectors. However, the many institutions, processes, regulatory frameworks, and legal instruments with direct and indirect roles in the global governance of One Health have led to a fragmented, global, multilateral health security architecture. We explore four challenges: first, the sectoral, professional, and institutional silos and tensions existing between human, animal, and environmental health; second, the challenge that the international legal system, state sovereignty, and existing legal instruments pose for the governance of One Health; third, the power dynamics and asymmetry in power between countries represented in multilateral institutions and their impact on priority setting; and finally, the current financing mechanisms that predominantly focus on response to crises, and the chronic underinvestment for epidemic and emergency prevention, mitigation, and preparedness activities. We illustrate the global and regional dimensions to these four challenges and how they relate to national needs and priorities through three case studies on compulsory licensing, the governance of water resources in the Lake Chad Basin, and the desert locust infestation in east Africa. Finally, we propose 12 recommendations for the global community to address these challenges. Despite its broad and holistic agenda, One Health continues to be dominated by human and domestic animal health experts. Substantial efforts should be made to address the social-ecological drivers of health emergencies including outbreaks of emerging, re-emerging, and endemic infectious diseases. These drivers include climate change, biodiversity loss, and land-use change, and therefore require effective and enforceable legislation, investment, capacity building, and integration of other sectors and professionals beyond health.

### Accelerating progress towards better public health and sustainable development in fragile settings [^114GFFeq]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

To inform the understanding of the linkages between health and the SDGs in fragile and conflict-affected countries, we conducted such assessments in Uganda, Somalia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is synthesised here and when compared provide useful insights. The teams of each country followed the same SDG Synergies approach, that is, a multisectoral group of stakeholders scored 240 unique pairwise linkages between different SDGs, where SDG 3 represented health. Across the three countries, we found a strikingly similar pattern. First, there were mostly positive linkages between the SDGs; the number of negative or restricting linkages was only 2–8%. This strengthens the argument for the overall synergistic reinforcing potential of making progress on all SDGs in fragile settings. SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) was considered the most important SDG for positively influencing all other SDGs, including health, in Somalia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The critical role of institutional stability and rule of law for enabling sustainable development is well known, and while not a fast or easy process, it is key to unwinding the vicious cycle of conflict, poverty and instability in conflict-affected countries. The different targets of SDG 16 have broad application across every aspect of sustainable development and health, from strong institutions to the reduction in violence and corruption. There are several challenges facing the successful implementation of SDG 16; however, the importance of SDG 16 underpinning progress on other SDGs cannot be overstated. In Uganda, a relatively more stable country with less conflict, SDG 16 was deemed the second most important SDG after SDG 10 (reduced inequalities) for overall sustainable development, which might reflect the growing concern of inequality as a hindrance to acceleration within a range of sectors, including health. Moreover, there is ample research on the connections between inequality and risk of eroding institutional stability, with many arguing that one of the key drivers of sustained progress and reduction of risk of conflicts is improved equality. Across the countries, the negative or restricting linkages found were often those between making progress on the economic or industry-related goals (SDG 8 and 9) and environmental goals (SDG 13, 14 and 15). The tension between economic and environmental priorities has become increasingly evident with accelerated climate change that affects large parts of populations in these countries simultaneously, as poverty and poor economic performance hinder investments. By investing in climate change, sound economic development and ensuring that mitigation and adaptation measures strengthen local economies, there are substantial opportunities for turning this perceived trade-off into impactful cobenefits. Across the three countries, health was seen as being one of the SDGs being influenced the most by the progress (or lack thereof) of other SDGs. In contrast, SDG 3 was not among the top-rated SDGs to positively influence other SDGs. One possible explanation for this is that the existing state of health and well-being might determine the possibility of advancing SDG 3 in these three countries. While it is undoubtedly important to focus on strengthening health system resilience and healthcare delivery, improvements in SDG 3-related areas alone are unlikely to drive broader sustainable development objectives and must be complemented by concurrent efforts across multiple goals to drive sustainable gains, including in health outcomes. This underscores the imperative for a comprehensive understanding of SDG interdependencies and highlights the necessity of a synergistic approach to sustainable development that incorporates broader social, economic and environmental determinants of health in fragile and conflict settings. An overview of the concept, steps of the SDG Synergies approach and benefits to policymakers are presented in figure 1.

### Reconciling irrigated food production with environmental flows for sustainable development goals implementation [^116hohvX]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Safeguarding river ecosystems is a precondition for attaining the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to water and the environment, while rigid implementation of such policies may hamper achievement of food security. River ecosystems provide life-supporting functions that depend on maintaining environmental flow requirements (EFRs). Here we establish gridded process-based estimates of EFRs and their violation through human water withdrawals. Results indicate that 41% of current global irrigation water use (997 km 3 per year) occurs at the expense of EFRs. If these volumes were to be reallocated to the ecosystems, half of globally irrigated cropland would face production losses of ≥ 10%, with losses of ∼20–30% of total country production especially in Central and South Asia. However, we explicitly show that improvement of irrigation practices can widely compensate for such losses on a sustainable basis. Integration with rainwater management can even achieve a 10% global net gain. Such management interventions are highlighted to act as a pivotal target in supporting the implementation of the ambitious and seemingly conflicting SDG agenda.

### Global health at a crossroads: WHO's 2025 emergency response to outbreaks, conflicts and humanitarian crises [^116VuWr2]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Although the strategic framework is robust, questions linger about the feasibility of implementation in the absence of guaranteed, long-term financial backing. WHO's appeal comes at a time when traditional donor commitments are wavering. Concerns about reduced US funding have raised alarms about the viability of the emergency response, as highlighted in a recent report. Without predictable funding streams and strengthened multilateral support, WHO risks falling short of its objectives, particularly in areas where humanitarian access is already restricted by insecurity and political fragmentation.

Equity remains a central ethical concern in the distribution of global health resources. Historically, high-profile crises in politically strategic regions have garnered disproportionate funding, whereas chronic, under-reported emergencies, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, are marginalised. UNICEF has issued urgent warnings about deteriorating health conditions for children across Eastern and Southern Africa, where overlapping disease outbreaks, malnutrition and displacement are threatening an entire generation. In countries like Somalia and Ethiopia, responses must be more than episodic relief; they must be sustained, rights-based interventions rooted in the social determinants of health.

Operational barriers are further compounded by restricted humanitarian access. In Yemen and Syria, WHO's response efforts have been severely impeded by conflict-related limitations, logistical constraints and reduced trust in global institutions. For example, in northwest Syria, health interventions have been obstructed by delayed cross-border authorisations and infrastructure destruction, severely compromising disease surveillance and immunisation activities. These challenges affect not only the delivery of care but also critical activities such as vaccination campaigns and health education. The erosion of humanitarian neutrality and the politicisation of aid delivery weaken the collective capacity to reach the most at-risk populations. The ethical imperative to protect health as a fundamental human right is increasingly undermined by geopolitical agendas.

Nevertheless, amidst these challenges, 2025 has also brought a historic breakthrough: the pandemic agreement adopted by WHO member states. This agreement marks a shift toward institutionalising pandemic preparedness and ensuring equitable access to essential health tools during future outbreaks. This development is a direct response to the global inequities witnessed during the COVID-19 pandemic and is a hopeful signal of the world's intent to reform global health governance. The agreement emphasises the need for fairness, transparency and inclusivity, particularly the participation of low-income and middle-income countries in global decision-making processes.

### Reconceptualising health security in post-COVID-19 world [^111LC41o]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

First, the concept is centred on people as the primary objective of security while recognising that the security of states is inevitably tied to the security of its people. Evidence has shown that human insecurity and social injustice are often the root causes of the failure of social contract between the citizens and the state and have led to violent conflict and disintegration of states in many instances (A major factor (among others) in the partition of India in 1947 has been the role of social exclusion of Muslims in undivided India. Later the social, political and economic exclusion of Bengalis in East Pakistan led to the disintegration of Pakistan in 1971;(accessed on 22 September 2020)).

Second, the concept of human security is based on a multisectoral approach that recognises that threats to security are interconnected across various sectors and across various levels (individual, national, international and global), suggesting that security agenda cannot be pursued effectively in a compartmentalised approach. Health insecurity, for instance, may lead to economic insecurity and economic insecurity may lead to food insecurity. Likewise, the concept emphasises the geographical and spatial connectivity of threats, a feature also referred to as the 'indivisibility' of threats that implies that transnational threats such as infectious diseases cannot be addressed in silo, leading us to the concept's third important feature: its emphasis on collective action and interstate cooperation to address challenges of global dimension. The concept recognises the sovereignty of states, but at the same time is sceptical of the capacity of states to provide global human security while calling for non-state actors and transnational civil society movements to address threats to global human security.

### Leaving no one behind: lessons on rebuilding health systems in conflict-and crisis-affected States [^113eN69K]. BMJ Global Health (2017). Medium credibility.

Conflict and fragility are increasing in many areas of the world. This context has been referred to as the 'new normal' and affects a billion people. Fragile and conflict-affected states have the worst health indicators and the weakest health systems. This presents a major challenge to achieving universal health coverage. The evidence base for strengthening health systems in these contexts is very weak and hampered by limited research capacity, challenges relating to insecurity and apparent low prioritisation of this area of research by funders. This article reports on findings from a multicountry consortium examining health systems rebuilding post conflict/crisis in Sierra Leone, Zimbabwe, northern Uganda and Cambodia. Across the ReBUILD consortium's interdisciplinary research programme, three cross-cutting themes have emerged through our analytic process: communities, human resources for health and institutions. Understanding the impact of conflict/crisis on the intersecting inequalities faced by households and communities is essential for developing responsive health policies. Health workers demonstrate resilience in conflict/crisis, yet need to be supported post conflict/crisis with appropriate policies related to deployment and incentives that ensure a fair balance across sectors and geographical distribution. Postconflict/crisis contexts are characterised by an influx of multiple players and efforts to support coordination and build strong responsive national and local institutions are critical. The ReBUILD evidence base is starting to fill important knowledge gaps, but further research is needed to support policy makers and practitioners to develop sustainable health systems, without which disadvantaged communities in postconflict and postcrisis contexts will be left behind in efforts to promote universal health coverage.

Health workers demonstrate resilience in conflict/crisis, yet need to be supported post conflict/crisis with appropriate policies related to deployment and incentives that ensure a fair balance across sectors and geographical distribution. Postconflict/crisis contexts are characterised by an influx of multiple players and efforts to support coordination and build strong responsive national and local institutions are critical. The ReBUILD evidence base is starting to fill important knowledge gaps, but further research is needed to support policy makers and practitioners to develop sustainable health systems, without which disadvantaged communities in postconflict and postcrisis contexts will be left behind in efforts to promote universal health coverage.

### Global health security and the health-security nexus: principles, politics and praxis [^111jhEoL]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

The fifth scenario involves security sector actors mobilising the health sector to perform a security function in a situation where there is no health threat. This includes examples of health actors being asked or co-opted to perform surveillance or intelligence gathering activities, sometimes in violation of ethical, legal and normative standards concerning confidentiality, trust, impartiality and neutrality. In this scenario, health sector resources are used to expand the capacity of the security sector, unlike the first four scenarios where the security sector typically extends the capacity of the health sector either directly or indirectly by generating financial or political support for the health sector.

While these five scenarios represent different ways in which health and security agendas and actors may interact, they need also to be considered in relation to two cross-cutting tensions. First, is the tension between national and international or global forces and approaches to security. Historically, security concerns have tended to be shaped by national actors and perspectives and are reflected in the dominant neocolonial approach to health security despite recognition of the borderless threats of infectious diseases, nuclear war and global warming and the increasing need for collective or global security. Incompatibilities or trade-offs between national and global security become more acute in the context of rising tensions and conflict between and within nation states, producing more entanglements in the form of scenarios 3, 4 and 5 as national security threats and agendas take priority over global health threats and agendas. In this regard, health actors may have an important role in actively promoting expansive and collective visions of global security over more parochial and partial visions of national security.

### Leveraging surveillance and evidence: preventing adverse childhood experiences through data to action [^114sqd9o]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Implementation Activities

To achieve Focus 2, PACE:D2A recipients are implementing approaches related to at least 2 of 3 core ACE prevention strategies focused on strengthening economic supports for families, promoting social norms that protect against violence and adversity, and ensuring a strong start for children (Appendix Table 2). Most recipients have chosen to promote social norms that protect against violence and adversity through public education campaigns on how to prevent ACEs within their state. Public education campaigns can shift the narrative from individual responsibility to one that is shared across the community to promote safe, stable, and nurturing relationships and environments for all children and normalize protective factors by enhancing connectedness and reducing stigma. Data collected through ACE surveillance informs whether this prevention strategy should be adapted to target populations within their state who may be at higher risk of experiencing ACEs. A total of 5 of 6 recipients have also chosen to ensure a strong start for children through early childhood home visitation or preschool enrichment with family engagement as a prevention strategy. Effective home visiting models can provide training and caregiver support on child health and development, reducing rates of child abuse and neglect. Recipients enhance early childhood home visitation programs by increasing access and providing training on ACE prevention to providers. Preschool enrichment programs with family engagement help children improve their physical, social, emotional, and cognitive development. In addition, these programs can help by strengthening the connections between home and school environments, benefiting children who may not have educational resources or support at home to help them learn and thrive. A total of 3 of 6 recipients have also chosen to implement strengthening economic supports to families by strengthening household financial security. Parents facing financial hardship have fewer resources to invest in their children, increasing the likelihood of experiencing stress, depression, and family conflict. Research consistently links having a low income to ACE exposures. Therefore, household financial security policies such as earned income tax credits and paid family and medical leave can prevent ACEs by increasing economic stability and improving parental resources to meet children's needs. In addition to these core strategies, 2 of 6 recipients are implementing strategies related to teaching skills through social emotional learning and connecting youth to caring adults by enhancing after-school mentoring programs through educating providers on adverse and positive childhood experiences. Furthermore, recipients are working toward sustainable system-level changes to increase coordination and collaboration between state agencies and other sectors. For example, recipients have leveraged multisector partnerships from child advocacy organizations, state HDs, and education sector partners to enhance data availability and existing state action plans. These partnerships support implementation and sustainability of ACE prevention strategies by improving awareness of existing state prevention strategies and convening workgroups. State representative workgroups are integral in identifying gaps and weaknesses and increase capacity to maintain surveillance systems among stakeholders. Building relationships and partnerships across multiple sectors and including nontraditional partners provides the opportunity to maximize prevention activities that could lead to higher impact and reach. Furthermore, identifying a common agenda with shared goals, strategies, and activities improves coordination, engagement, and participation, increasing prevention efforts.

### Global property rights and land use efficiency [^1114ugub]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The countries that exemplify common law and robust protection of property rights, such as the United States, Australia, and Canada, prioritize government responsibility in providing equitable compensation to landowners when their actions greatly devalue properties. A well-established title ensures stable taxation while imposing taxes on vacant land increases holding costs for inefficient use of land. Strong property rights act as a check on governmental power by limiting encroachment upon private property. Furthermore, clearly defined property rights mitigate corruption among local officials and collusion between governments and businesses, striking a balance between public regulation and private property rights in the real estate market. In the US, reorganization of land rights enables more efficient utilization and transfer of land, thereby enhancing its value. Similarly, incremental reforms through legal instruments have guaranteed an efficient system for land use in the UK. Australia boasts a robust framework for protecting and transferring property rights with an efficient registry system that ensures transparency and security during transactions.

Countries with civil law, such as France, Germany, China, Russia, and Brazil, exhibit a higher prevalence of ambiguous property rights compared to common law countries. This ambiguity contributes to an increase in land conflicts and a decrease in productivity. For example, in China, land ownership is categorized into state-owned land and collective-owned land. Rural collective-owned land lacks the right to generate income from development or be transferred to other users. This lack of clarity has facilitated low-compensation acquisitions by local governments and is considered as a major factor contributing to urban sprawl across China. In Russia, despite transitioning to a market economy after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, many lands remain uncertainly defined, potentially leading to misuse. This uncertainty hampers effective land management and conservation efforts while widespread corruption and fraud impede property rights protection effectiveness, and thereby negatively hinder economic development –. Brazil's property system has been profoundly influenced by high concentration of land ownership and large estates (latifundia) since the 19th century which exacerbates social inequality. The instability of property rights affects investment opportunities and long-term land development while violent conflicts related to disputes over ownership threaten social stability and environmental quality.

### Global public health security [^117RR6ea]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

– — Dr. Margaret Chan, Director General, World Health Organization; World Health Day 2007

"When the world is collectively at risk, defense becomes a shared responsibility of all nations".

The framework of the newly revised International Health Regulations is a key driver in the effort to strengthen global public health security. Unanimously agreed upon by the World Health Assembly on May 23, 2005, the regulations are the result of experience gained and lessons learned during the past 30 years. This global legal framework includes a commitment from the World Health Organization (WHO) and from each WHO member state to improve capacity for disease prevention, detection, and response. It provides standards for addressing national public health threats that have the potential to become global emergencies. Its success will rely on the capacity and performance of national public health systems, anchored by strong national public health institutes (NPHIs). The new International Association of National Public Health Institutes aims to strengthen and invigorate existing NPHIs, to create new NPHIs where none exist, and to provide funded grants to support NPHI development priorities.

In the wake of the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), preparedness for public health emergencies was propelled into worldwide consciousness. The appearance and rapid international spread of SARS demonstrated to all — including global leaders, ministers of health, prime ministers, and heads of state — how an infectious disease can rapidly cross borders and deliver health threats and economic blows on an unimaginable scale. Since then, the entrenchment of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N1) in poultry flocks of Asian countries, and the spread of the virus across Europe and into Africa, has put the world on high alert for an influenza pandemic and affirmed the urgency of strengthening public health systems and capacity worldwide.

Compounding the challenges of threats to public health security from new and reemerging infectious diseases and the concerns about intentional dissemination of chemical or biological substances are the challenges of ensuring individual health security. These latter challenges include the unfinished agenda of broadening access to the drugs, vaccines, and other interventions needed to control endemic diseases such as malaria, acute lower respiratory tract infections, diarrheal diseases, measles, and tuberculosis, as well as to address the ongoing problems of HIV/AIDS, neglected tropical diseases, humanitarian emergencies, and global environmental changes.

### Foresight approaches for future health shocks: integration into policy making and accompanying research priorities [^112yRwxD]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Reality of politics and policy

Finally, one overarching, unresolved problem remains: how to accommodate emergency preparedness within the reality of politics as well as policy. How do we support resilient, long term (often over decades) policy making within short term electoral cycles and concerns? How do we support choosing optimal policies, in line with articulated values and objectives, if they conflict with the current political situation?

Perhaps, then, the final future research strand needs to be how to move from an aim of optimal policy making to one that is pragmatic and "good enough" — that is, resilient to the vagaries of politics and high turnover of decision makers at all levels.

### How prepared is the world? Identifying weaknesses in existing assessment frameworks for global health security through a one health approach [^114ivC8B]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed faults in the way we assess preparedness and response capacities for public health emergencies. Existing frameworks are limited in scope, and do not sufficiently consider complex social, economic, political, regulatory, and ecological factors. One Health, through its focus on the links among humans, animals, and ecosystems, is a valuable approach through which existing assessment frameworks can be analysed and new ways forward proposed. Although in the past few years advances have been made in assessment tools such as the International Health Regulations Joint External Evaluation, a rapid and radical increase in ambition is required. To sufficiently account for the range of complex systems in which health emergencies occur, assessments should consider how problems are defined across stakeholders and the wider sociopolitical environments in which structures and institutions operate. Current frameworks do little to consider anthropogenic factors in disease emergence or address the full array of health security hazards across the social-ecological system. A complex and interdependent set of challenges threaten human, animal, and ecosystem health, and we cannot afford to overlook important contextual factors, or the determinants of these shared threats. Health security assessment frameworks should therefore ensure that the process undertaken to prioritise and build capacity adheres to core One Health principles and that interventions and outcomes are assessed in terms of added value, trade-offs, and cobenefits across human, animal, and environmental health systems.

### The systemic and governmental agendas in presidential attention to climate change in Mexico 1994–2018 [^111VtsvX]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Ambitious climate action requires that policy and decision-makers focus on the issue in the long term. Agenda-setting studies seek to elucidate why some problems emerge and are included in the public agenda and policies (e.g. in refs.). Since individuals and institutions have a limited capacity for attention (e.g. in refs.–), understanding how problems capture the leaders' attention is criticalas the level of attention indicates the importance of an issue and has agenda-setting effects. Our objective is to investigate from an agenda-setting viewpoint how the attention to climate change paid by Mexican presidents evolved from 1994 to 2018: in particular, we assess the effect of changes in the governmental and systemic or legal agendas on the level of attention.

Interest in environmental issues, such as climate change rise and fall over time. but it is in periods of high interest when new institutions and policies to address them are adopted. Policies and attention cycles can have long stable periods alongside short and intense periods of agenda and policy change, which can have long-lasting effects (i.e. punctutated equilibrium). In his classic work Kingdon, proposed that three conditions need to be met for an issue to enter an agenda: a problem is recognized, solutions are available and political conditions are favorable. A window of opportunity arises when the three conditions are met and policy change can be promoted. The complementary punctuated equilibrium model suggests that changes in interests and policy processes are linked to changes in the definition of issues and relevant institutions.

Earlier research has shown that attention to climate change is affected by new scientific information, feedback on implemented actions and focusing events. Historically, developing countries had little interest in climate policy because economic development was seen to require industrialization and increased carbon emissions. Climate policy was thus not a priority for them and any interest in it was at first based on international consensus and only later on domestic support. Following the negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) climate policy has spread from international to national and sub-national levels. The attention paid to climate change is increasing both in international and national agendas. In developing countries, drivers of climate policy include international negotiations; potential access to international finance; reputation; interest in international decision making; concerns about energy security and other local problems or co-benefits; the sense of responsibility; and interest to divert external pressure for more ambitious action.

### Trade is central to achieving the sustainable development goals: a case study of antimicrobial resistance [^117FpjRM]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Trade and antimicrobial resistance

Antimicrobial resistance has rapidly ascended the political agenda and is now recognised as a major threat to health, prosperity, and global health security. Substantial funding — with estimates of $40bn (£31bn; €35bn) over the next 10 years — is being sought to tackle the problem, and the World Health Assembly endorsed a global action plan on antimicrobial resistance in 2015. But meeting these challenges will not be straightforward as it requires the collaboration of a large number of stakeholders across animal, human, and environmental spheres, often with conflicting interests and networks.

Here we outline core areas where trade is critical to tackling antimicrobial resistance, highlighting key areas for action to achieve the SDGs and the 2030 agenda (box 1). We will focus mainly on commodities traded and the possible effect of trade related regulation and agreements.

Trade and antimicrobial resistance intersect in several ways. On a fundamental level trade (mobility) of people, animals, and goods is connected to the spread of microbes, and in human transmission there is a clear association with travel routes and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance.

### Engaging globally with how to achieve healthy societies: insights from India, Latin America and east and Southern Africa [^1136H3D8]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

The escalation of a biosecurity focus

While a healthy society was increasingly understood to demand a healthy planet, the pathogenic paradigm and its focus on technical interventions also obtained new momentum in a biosecurity paradigm, responding to recurrent health emergencies and perceived threats from biological weapons, biotechnology and bioterrorism that opened space to reconceptualise 'security' beyond military threats. Biosecurity, defined by WHO as the prevention, detection and response to infectious disease threats of international concern, became more pronounced in global policy-making in the 2000s. The September 11 terror attack in the USA possibly also gave greater impetus to its already increasing focus on health security. In 2014, a USA-supported Global Health Security Agenda was launched with 69 countries, international and non-state organisations, and corporations to respond to 'global health threats posed by infectious diseases'.

The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 escalated this focus on biosecurity. On the one hand, some countries and communities have applied holistic, rights-based and SDH-based responses to COVID-19, catalysing debates about state obligations and global, collective responsibilities in the pandemic, including for key health technologies to be made available as global public goods. However, the more dominant response has been biosecurity-focused, largely through centrally led and sometimes coercive quarantining and control measures, often unresponsive to local conditions and communities. National protectionism has generated significant inequalities in access to essential health technologies, despite UN appeals for collective security. While still evolving, the pandemic demonstrates the risks of a dominant technology-driven biosecurity focus, including in terms of socioeconomic inequality and insecurity, rights violations and social distrust, with the lowest income countries and communities most affected, and the ecosystem and deeper public health determinants of pandemics poorly addressed.

### Drought-induced civil conflict among the ancient maya [^115cb24a]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

As a counterpart to strong archeological, historical, and climatic evidence for civil conflict and institutional collapse at Mayapan, we explored different pathways for resilience and societal transformation to regional climate change. Mobility was an important component of social change as people dispersed from Mayapan to other parts of the Yucatán Peninsula. This was a common indigenous response, observed historically during drought periods when Maya people abandoned Spanish towns and dispersed to settlements in the unsubdued frontier to the south. The social and political landscape of the Yucatán Peninsula was also reorganized into a network of smaller states that were politically independent, but economically interwoven. Prosperous coastal towns, first observed by Spaniards, took advantage of a variety of freshwater features, and marine resources that provided opportunities for subsistence and economic diversification. Maritime commerce thrived, with large canoes carrying salt, chocolate and other commodities around the peninsula. At the time of European contact, the Yucatán Peninsula was divided into 15 states, some with developed hierarchies and kings (halach winik) and others more loosely organized; bureaucratic systems ranking nobles according to an array of religious and political titles. The conflict between states occurred and each state had military leaders who could quickly mobilize armies, but there is little historical evidence for civil conflict within each state. Ironically, climatic impacts caused by drought and related pestilences continued in northern Yucatán with little respite in the century following Mayapan's fall. Yet economic, social, and religious traditions persevered until the onset of Spanish rule, despite the reduced scale of political units, attesting to a resilient system of human-environmental adaptations.

### Three foci at the science-policy interface for systemic sustainable development goal acceleration [^112DYL9v]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The current scientific insights of SDG interactions are highly policy-relevant and sufficient to inform systemic prioritization of actions to accelerate SDG progress. However, a stronger focus on actionable guidance could strengthen their policy use. There is enough knowledge about changes needed to achieve SDGs but not how, particularly in different political and social contexts. A way forward is to bring together different research communities working on specific subfields and to combine quantitative and qualitative approachesfor identifying interventions for decision-makers. A deeper integration of various approaches is needed to better represent different dynamics.

Providing sound recommendations requires contextualized SDG interaction analyses, accounting for their spatial and temporal characteristics, including opportunities for policy interventions, sound governance, and stakeholders' actions. Policymakers' priorities are shaped by the dynamics and urgency of their problems. Thus, policy-oriented SDG interaction assessments can improve the choice and design of policies to respond to these challenges. These assessments' findings and their practical interpretation and communication can inform policymakers and make them aware of incentives and barriers related to different policies. They can use this knowledge to embed SDG interactions in policies based on adequate interventions.

Box 1 Examples of interactions between Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and gaps

SDG interactions depend on actions and policies: Achieving climate action (SDG13) through large-scale land-based mitigation can negatively impact food security (SDG 2), water (SDG 6), or biodiversity (SDGs 14 and 15). However, reducing energy demand and enhancing sustainable agricultural practices can also ensure food security with positive impacts on water, soil, land, and biodiversity. SDG interactions can also be indirect or occur through complex feedback chains.

Importance of addressing SDG trade-offs: Pursuing a fossil fuel-based development pathway negatively impacts environmental goals, which can accumulate and escalate over time. Instead, a shift towards renewable energy may result in short-term trade-offs, such as missed opportunities for economic growth through resource extraction or the loss of livelihoods of dependent communities. However, this pathway could also unlock investments, green economies, and employment opportunities over the longer term.

Uneven understanding of SDG interactions: There are considerable knowledge gaps concerning peace, political institutions, diversity, age-structure changes, and gender-related issues, whereas climate and health (e.g. COVID) have been given more attention. This gap also holds for the empirical understanding of SDG interactions at different spatial scales, including transboundary spillover effects.

### Ethical health security in the age of antimicrobial resistance [^112Go8sR]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Notably, however, there appear to be inconsistencies in the literature regarding whether AME is indeed a public good. For some authors, AME is instead characterised as a 'common good' or 'common pool resource'. Common goods are defined as goods that are non-exclusive but rivalrous. This is because the conditions that have enabled AMR to worsen — that is, global market failures and lack of incentives to develop new drugs and implement stewardship arrangements to govern their appropriate use (the 'misalignment of public and private interests') — have led effective antimicrobials to be seen as a finite resource and therefore rivalrous in consumption. Without appropriate regulatory mechanisms to preserve the effectiveness of antimicrobials, consumption of such agents now erodes the effectiveness of agents used in the future. That is, 'each time an antibiotic is ingested, the likelihood increases that the antibiotic will be less effective in the future not only for the person who took the antibiotic, but for others as well'. AME is therefore frequently described as the 'tragedy of the (antibiotic) commons'. The literature has drawn parallels between AME and environmental resources as common goods, such as clean air and water, which are also subject to depletion in the absence of strong regulation. While some papers are explicit about the difference in public and common goods, the literature more broadly tends to use these terms interchangeably and often without clarification. One paper, for example, describes antibiotic effectiveness as 'a common pool resource or public good'(emphasis added), while another states that 'to avoid an AMR 'tragedy of the commons' situation, antimicrobial effectiveness needs to be recognized as a fundamentally important global public good'. Other papers describe AME (or antimicrobials themselves) as either a public goodor a common good (or a common pool resource), sometimes without necessarily explaining the features that define it as such (see online supplemental appendix one, table of quotes).

Approaches to securing AME (the 'how"')

Having identified AME as a public or a common good, authors then proposed approaches to securing AME, while describing who is responsible for doing so. Responsibility is a foundational idea of ethics and speaks directly to the concept of legitimacy (i.e. who should act and how they should act). The literature includes instances of three distinct approaches: statism, globalism and regionalism.

### The 12 dimensions of health impacts of war (the 12-D framework): a novel framework to conceptualise impacts of war on social and environmental determinants of health and public health [^113uSKLd]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Health impacts of war

Armed conflicts directly kill, injure, maim and destroy life. Wars are positively associated with an increase in all-cause mortality due to widespread impacts on health and healthcare. The presence of non-communicable diseases, cancers, communicable diseases, maternal, neonatal and nutritional diseases, all contributed to increased civilian deaths associated with wars.

Wars could be viewed as an organised attempt to kill fellow humans while destroying or degrading millions of human lives knowingly and deliberately, the very antithesis of the morals or codes of conduct of health professionals who are ethically bound to improve well-being of fellow humans and avoid deliberate harm. Therefore, the relative lack of interest among health professionals in opposing all forms of violence and wars is surprising.

The relative disinterest on health issues generated by wars is observed even in organisations that are active in health issues at a global scale and some reports on health and human development rarely discuss the impact of wars. Terms such as violence, conflicts and human rights violations are used instead, as if there is deliberate attempt to shy away from using the word 'war'. This situation could be partly explained by its governance structures and processes. It is well known that the current global order and United Nations (UN) system is dominated by a powerful United Nations Security Council (UN-SC) and other UN organisations, such as the WHO, United Nations Development Programme and UNESCO, are effectively excluded from discussing the topic of wars and inter-state conflicts. The decisions of the UN-SC are shaped by six of the most powerful nations who hold veto powers on all matters of war, peace and security. Coincidentally, these very self-appointed nations collectively stockpile most of the nuclear weapons and are the most prolific manufacturers of lethal weapons.

### Prepared for the polycrisis? The need for complexity science and systems thinking to address global and national evidence gaps [^1166LHUT]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

The Sustainable Development Goals are far off track. The convergence of global threats such as climate change, conflict and the lasting effects of the COVID-19 pandemic-among others-call for better data and research evidence that can account for the complex interactions between these threats. In the time of polycrisis, global and national-level data and research evidence must address complexity. Viewed through the lens of 'systemic risk', there is a need for data and research evidence that is sufficiently representative of the multiple interdependencies of global threats. Instead, current global published literature seems to be dominated by correlational, descriptive studies that are unable to account for complex interactions. The literature is geographically limited and rarely from countries facing severe polycrisis threats. As a result, country guidance fails to treat these threats interdependently. Applied systems thinking can offer more diverse research methods that are able to generate complex evidence. This is achievable through more participatory processes that will assist stakeholders in defining system boundaries and behaviours. Additionally, applied systems thinking can draw on known methods for hypothesising, modelling, visualising and testing complex system properties over time. Application is much needed for generating evidence at the global level and within national-level policy processes and structures.

### Natural resources modulate the nexus between environmental shocks and human mobility [^115F8YTU]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

A schematic contextual framework to understand how resource scarcity and abundance intersect with migration processes is presented in Fig. 1. This diagram shows that resource scarcity and resource abundance can both lead to disruptive impacts on human populations and their well-being. Different causal pathways are presented in this regard and conflict can be a result of these divergent mechanisms. Demography links to environmental factors through metrics such as carrying capacity (which can itself change with adaptive technologies) and may lead to resource scarcity. On the other hand, resource abundance without appropriate distributive mechanisms can lead to inequality and hamper economic development, which is in turn also linked to migration movements. Conflict can occur within the migration nexus through the combination of tribalist impulses ensuing from resource scarcity or distribution failures, particularly in kleptocracies, as well as through the kinetics of physical movement and clashes with existing populations. Containing these scenarios to avert conflict requires us to overcome the challenges of governing an inherently complex system and also the security imperatives which any conflict dynamic can instigate. Two overarching challenges frame this set of relationships: political governance at the macro level and security and management concerns at the micro level.

Fig. 1
Conceptal framework of the interaction between resource scarcity/abundance and migration.

Natural resources as a mediator in the link between environmental shocks and migration.

In our contribution, we examine the agricultural pathway of environmental risks to migration, highlighting the mechanism of deteriorating land resources due to drought. In particular, we explore the statistical relationship between drought episodes (identified by making use of the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI)) and subnational population density, thus linking environmental shocks to (internal) migration flows. We explore whether the presence of mineral resources acts as a mediating factor in the relationship between drought and migration. Focusing on the continent of Africa, we find that for locations with low income, drought conditions are statistically related to increased internal migration from the affected area, while for international migration they are associated with decreased international migration (see Supplementary Material). We also find that sustained drought episodes are associated with stronger effects, and that the presence of mineral resources dampens the influence of drought on migration.

### Overcoming challenges of community engagement… [^112k5esD]. atsdr.cdc.gov (2024). Medium credibility.

At a glance Differences of opinion – and sometimes conflict – about facts, interpretation of the facts, next steps, and communication are inherent to this work. Media attention means that these differences will be amplified. Additionally, local and interpersonal politics may play a role in community engagement. What to Know You may also find yourself engaging with communities whose previous experience with government agencies has resulted in distrust. When you recognize distrust, try to understand a community's perceptions, history, needs, and challenges. This may help you better understand the distrust. Work to develop relationships and find ways to align with community goals. Do this by maximizing opportunities to listen to concerns and help community members better understand how you will address their concerns. Slowly but surely, such actions contribute to building trust and credibility for ATSDR staff in the field.

ATSDR's ability to respond to the full range of community concerns may be determined by our agency mission and resources. For example, ATSDR focuses on identifying how people might be exposed to environmental contamination within their community. ATSDR then determines whether those exposures could be harmful. However, some communities may approach environmental contamination from other perspectives. It is critical to meet your organizations and community's needs by overcoming challenges of engagement, transparency, and availability of resources. Despite the challenges, community engagement strengthens relationships between communities and ATSDR, and protects public health.

### Summary and conclusion: framing a new research agenda on maternal morbidities and mortality in the United States [^117EVfMR]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Maternal mortality in the United States is at an alarming rate. Research can have an important role in addressing maternal mortality, but our current understanding of its causes and prevention remains woefully incomplete. The collection of articles in this volume begin to frame a new research agenda by asking four critical questions. First, what truly makes vulnerable populations vulnerable? Second, how do we prevent pregnancy complications and their long-term sequelae? Third, how can we make maternity care safer for all women? Finally, what can we do about the social, structural, and environmental determinants of maternal health? Answers to these questions can help inform practice, systems, and policy change to reduce and ultimately eradicate maternal deaths in the United States.

### The disparities and development trajectories of nations in achieving the sustainable development goals [^115nbYQC]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

On the road to achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, monitoring and assessing progress and recognizing sustainable development patterns for countries over time are key priorities for national and international institutions. To this end, understanding each country's relative strengths and weaknesses regarding SDG areas may help design future better indicators and development policies.

This study unveiled a bipolar world, with countries having high SDG scores specialized in poverty reduction, good health and well-being, treatment of wastewater and air pollution, access to clean energy and water, innovation, and government administration and countries with low SDG scores having relative advantages in overnutrition, embodied social and environmental impacts in international trade, and resource use, waste and emissions. Moreover, at different stages of sustainable development, certain areas – including environmental quality, overnutrition, and impacts of international trade – are left under-specialized by different countries. This bipolar world revealed by the SDG space is supported by previous studies – that have identified global disparities in SDGs, and it can be partly explained by the trade-offs between SDGs. For instance, the SDGs related to economic development and basic livelihood security (e.g. SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 11), are often associated with higher environmental and resource footprints – and increased greenhouse gas emissions, which can hinder progress on SDGs 12 and 13. These trends align with the concept of the environmental Kuznets curve, which suggests that when countries have a lower GDP per capita, the pursuit of economic growth tends to take precedence over environmental preservation concerns.

### The socioeconomic and environmental niche of protected areas reveals global conservation gaps and opportunities [^115zXoe4]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

There are some marked differences between land and sea when looking at the secondary factors explaining the relative likelihood of PA occurrences. Elevation was positively related to terrestrial PA relative occurrence (e.g. lots of PAs in Europe are located in the mountains), while water depth was negatively correlated to the relative occurrence of marine PAs, highlighting a global positive bias of protection coverage on the coast and a pelagic deficit within countries' EEZs. Yet, remote areas, characterised by their low accessibility, are more likely to be protected than accessible coastal areas, a known bias towards residual marine PAs, while accessibility has no visible effect on land.

When focusing on the most restrictive IUCN category I PAs, partial responses show similar relationships (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. 6). The number of conflicts, the number of NGOs, and dependence on natural resources are the strongest correlates of PA relative occurrence, albeit to a lower extent than when all IUCN categories are considered. However, HDI is no longer important on sea, but is still a strong factor on land, suggesting an overrepresentation of restrictive terrestrial PAs in developed countries. At sea, accessibility and dependency on natural resources have the strongest negative relation with relative IUCN PA occurrence, illustrating strong barriers to PA establishment along coastlines where human density is high and marine resources are essential for livelihood or food security. In contrast, accessibility and human footprint have no negative relationship with IUCN I PA occurrence on land, suggesting fewer or weaker barriers due to human pressure in restrictive terrestrial PA establishment. As an alternative explanation, old restrictive terrestrial PAs, like US national parks, were initially created in remote areas that have experienced substantial increases in housing density since 1940. Therefore, even in populated areas (e.g. agricultural plains), IUCN category I PAs appear to be viable management options if the socioeconomic context is favourable (high number of NGOs and HDI but also low dependency on natural resources and number of conflicts), suggesting that highly restrictive terrestrial PAs are not fatally constrained to 'high and far' areas. Yet, this expansion may be compromised by projected land use and parochialism, since large-scale conservation actions can be locally constrained by political and stakeholder units.

### Integrating cancer into crisis: a global vision for action from WHO and partners [^112Lm6d2]. The Lancet: Oncology (2025). High credibility.

More than a billion people live in fragile, conflict-affected, and vulnerable settings requiring humanitarian support, where cancer is a substantial health issue. Despite its substantial effect on populations, cancer care remains underprioritised in emergency preparedness and response frameworks and humanitarian operational planning. This Policy Review summarises the perspectives and actionable recommendations from the First Global High-Level Technical Meeting on Non-communicable Diseases in Humanitarian Settings, with a focus on cancer. The paper highlights the challenges of providing cancer care in fragile, conflict-affected, and vulnerable settings and proposes a comprehensive roadmap to address both immediate and long-term needs of patients with cancer living in these settings. Key solutions include: integrating the cancer care continuum into national preparedness and response plans to enhance health-care system resilience; integrating cancer into humanitarian responses efforts; addressing the specific needs of paediatric patients with cancer; improving cancer intelligence and surveillance systems; and developing strategies to navigate the logistical and financial challenges of providing cancer care during crises. Additionally, the paper outlines practical actions and next steps for international cooperation needed to drive a shift in global health priorities and elevate cancer in the global health security agenda. We hope the presented notions will help prevent millions of avoidable deaths among people with cancer.

### Public perceptions on carbon removal from focus groups in 22 countries [^114yKLcL]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Proposed governance focused on opportunities to harness the diversity of application. Groups – especially in tropical forested countries – connected afforestation and reforestation efforts to banning or disincentivizing deforestation, establishing protected zones for key or iconic ecosystems (the Amazon, or wetlands), or restoring deforested areas and re-purposing brownfields. Avoided deforestation is not technically classified as a form of carbon removal, but focus groups often conflated this with afforestation and reforestation as part of general forestry management efforts. Strong pluralities across North and South highlighted the need for diverse land-use regulations coupled with private-public initiatives (e.g. monitoring and halting illegal logging; zoning / land-reallocation for green areas; tree-planting campaigns; strengthening small-holder ownership), direct state intervention (buying brownfields; compensating for lost income; supplying seeds), and especially, economic incentives and consultation campaigns for landowners to prioritize carbon stocks. Urban opportunities were noted across North and South contexts: rooftop and vertical gardens, city zoning and construction laws requiring green areas and components, and co-benefits for urban health and air pollution. Much questioning surrounded the scale and sequestration potential of urban carbon stocks.

Regarding concerns: strong pluralities across the global North and South highlighted two spatial trade-offs in using land for carbon stocks. The first was a trade-off with food crops. Fearing food insecurity, groups referenced the bioenergy-driven food versus fuel trade-off; or the need for income stability, given a lack of financial incentives to choose against growing cash crops. The second trade-off referenced competition with residential development, driven by widespread perceptions of population growth, with (often, global South) participants highlighting insufficient housing developments, and others (often, global North) noting distributed, space-intensive private property. Both trade-offs motivated concerns of property seizure in a smaller number of groups, ranging from corporate versus smallholder land-grabs familiar in bioeconomy conflicts to 'eminent domain' appropriations. The impermanence of carbon forestry driven by profit motives emerged as a concern from a small plurality across all regions, though most strongly represented in European groups: in the absence of proper monitoring, lumber companies might quickly deforest replanted areas, exacerbated by illegal logging and governmental corruption in granting permits.

### Oslo ministerial declaration – global health: a pressing foreign policy issue of our time [^117GVEHw]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Under their initiative on Global Health and Foreign Policy, launched in September, 2006, in New York, the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Brazil, France, Indonesia, Norway, Senegal, South Africa, and Thailand issued the following statement in Oslo on March 20, 2007-In today's era of globalisation and interdependence there is an urgent need to broaden the scope of foreign policy. Together, we face a number of pressing challenges that require concerted responses and collaborative efforts. We must encourage new ideas, seek and develop new partnerships and mechanisms, and create new paradigms of cooperation. We believe that health is one of the most important, yet still broadly neglected, long-term foreign policy issues of our time. Life and health are our most precious assets. There is a growing awareness that investment in health is fundamental to economic growth and development. It is generally acknowledged that threats to health may compromise a country's stability and security. We believe that health as a foreign policy issue needs a stronger strategic focus on the international agenda. We have therefore agreed to make impact on health a point of departure and a defining lens that each of our countries will use to examine key elements of foreign policy and development strategies, and to engage in a dialogue on how to deal with policy options from this perspective. As Ministers of Foreign Affairs, we will work to: increase awareness of our common vulnerability in the face of health threats by bringing health issues more strongly into the arenas of foreign policy discussions and decisions, in order to strengthen our commitment to concerted action at the global level; build bilateral, regional and multilateral cooperation for global health security by strengthening the case for collaboration and brokering broad agreement, accountability, and action; reinforce health as a key element in strategies for development and for fighting poverty, in order to reach the Millennium Development Goals; ensure that a higher priority is given to health in dealing with trade issues and in conforming to the Doha principles, affirming the right of each country to make full use of TRIPS flexibilities in order to ensure universal access to medicines; strengthen the place of health measures in conflict and crisis management and in reconstruction efforts. For this purpose, we have prepared a first set of actionable steps for raising the priority of health in foreign policy in an Agenda for Action. We pledge to pursue these issues in our respective regional settings and in relevant international bodies. We invite Ministers of Foreign Affairs from all regions to join us in further exploring ways and means to achieve our objectives.

### Leveraging international health regulations (2005) to enhance health security in the Eastern mediterranean region: a retrospective analysis from 2016 to 2023 [^116dQ2ja]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

The Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) of the WHO has a unique geopolitical context with a huge diversity being composed of 22 member states, spread along the biggest two continents globally, Africa and Asia, with seven member states in Africa and 15 in Asia. This geographically diverse region has historically grappled with a complex interplay of socioeconomic, political and environmental factors that have given rise to health vulnerabilities, with low and lower-middle-income countries representing 13 out of 22 in the region (59.1%).

The EMR has been confronted with multiple health challenges that have not only affected its healthcare systems but also tested the resilience of its member states. Over the years, the region witnessed the emergence of novel health threats alongside the persistence of existing ones. The burden of communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases and humanitarian crises has imposed significant strains on healthcare infrastructures, underscoring the urgent need for cohesive strategies to strengthen health security.

The health security, represented by the capacity to prevent, detect, respond to and recover from health crises, and defined as the activities required, both proactive and reactive, to minimise the danger and impact of acute public health events that endanger people's health across geographical regions and international boundaries, according to WHO's definition, has emerged as a predominant concern in the EMR. Recently, a significant increase in the number of emergencies in the region was noticed due to multiple hazards. More than 50 disease outbreaks were responded to in the EMR in 2022, compared with 31 in 2021 and 14 in 2020, and the number of people in need of humanitarian assistance has increased from 102.3 million to 127.3 million.

Lack of security in the majority of the EMR countries, major natural disasters, including the floods in Pakistan, food insecurity in Somalia, earthquake in the Syrian Arab Republicand drought in the Greater Horn of Africa, aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic and severe economic crisis in some member states including Lebanon and the Syrian Arab Republic, have contributed to an unprecedented level of humanitarian need and vulnerability across the region. Several member states in the EMR are currently facing protracted humanitarian crisis, including Afghanistan, Palestine, Somalia and Sudan, with multiple disease outbreaks, natural disasters, armed conflicts and internal and external displacement throughout the past years.

### Food for thought [^1136ozvM]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

What should we eat in order to stay healthy and avoid disease? Nutrition is one of the biggest drivers of chronic diseases, including obesity and diabetes, yet the answer to this seemingly simple question remains a subject of heated debate. A new series of articles in The BMJ aims to cut through the confusion and controversy to bring the latest evidence on nutrition to clinicians.

The number of studies exploring the link between food and health has grown substantially over the past 50 years, but the extent to which the growth in information has been matched by greater understanding is questionable. Navigating the vast evidence base is challenging, even more so when concerns about weak science, vested interests, and conflicting or distorted media messages also muddy the waters. Nor do people eat for purely utilitarian ends. Food is central to culture and identity, which leads to strongly held preferences, beliefs, and biases.

Our goal at The BMJ is to advance understanding through research and debate, but we recognise that sometimes additions to the literature can generate more heat than light. This series is our attempt to take a different approach. We have brought together some of the world's most thoughtful and influential voices in the field of nutrition and health, representing a range of backgrounds and perspectives, to help make sense of the state of current knowledge, the quality of the evidence on key issues, the extent and implications of potential disagreements between experts, and the agenda for further research.

Guided by our series advisers, Dariush Mozaffarian and Nita Forouhi, we have chosen topics covering priority areas of clinical interest and unresolved controversy. The articles consider questions that will help doctors offer clarity and sensible advice to patients and guide policy makers towards effective actions. Is there a link between saturated fat and heart disease? What are the best diets for weight loss, and how good is the evidence to support them? Can a particular dietary pattern help prevent or reverse type 2 diabetes? Will interventions focused on personalised nutrition and the gut microbiome be beneficial for health? How can we address the urgent global problems of hunger and malnutrition? And what is the role of government and the food industry in tackling ill health related to food? The articles lay out what we know and what we've yet to learn in these areas and more. Following the initial launch, more articles are planned in the coming months covering topics ranging from the relation between food and cancer to the quality of dietary guidelines.

### Preparing international cooperation on pandemic prevention for the anthropocene [^117JqrMZ]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has centred zoonotic viruses in nearly every discipline's efforts to reckon with modernity. This has been particularly highlighted in environmental policy, given the rise of paradigms like 'One Health' that centre the interconnectedness of human health and the environment, and that have given conservation organisations a seat at the table in global health. For those communities of practice, COVID-19 has underscored issues with the sustainability and safety of contact between humans and wildlife, and concerns about how unsustainable practices could contribute to the future emergence of novel coronaviruses or similar pandemic threats.

More broadly, these conversations have pointed to a broader need to address the upstream drivers of poor health and disease burden outside of pandemic settings. In the One Health or planetary health tradition, pandemics can be viewed the product of several proximate drivers (eg, climate change, biodiversity loss, land degradation), all of which share an ultimate cause: the explosion of consumption, and destruction of the natural world, caused by capitalism, globalisation, colonialism and neoliberal economic policies. Insufficiently addressed by national and international policies to date (and, possibly, by proposed solutions for future sustainable growth), this process has pushed civilisation outside of a narrow zone that safely balances human well-being and economic growth against environmental preservation and long-term sustainability. This emerging view suggests that the most effective solutions may lie upstream in rethinking this model and addressing its failures across sectors, from carbon emissions to quality of life.

Even acknowledging the urgency of these societal transformations, we suggest that global health should carefully weigh the odds of successful risk reduction through upstream solutions, particularly in the near-term. To facilitate that analysis, we here review the most significant drivers of viral emergence, and the current state of international cooperative agreements that might produce meaningful transitions towards sustainability and reduced disease risk. Given current geopolitical challenges (especially in environmental policy), we contend that the sum of conservation-reliant approaches will still be insufficient to prevent future public health emergencies. To adapt pandemic preparedness to the Anthropocene, policymakers must focus on multilateral cooperation to develop stronger and more equitable public health governance, to strengthen health systems for universal health coverage, and to adapt viral surveillance to the pressures of a changing world.

### A new scenario logic for the paris agreement long-term temperature goal [^117YGzGR]. Nature (2019). Excellent credibility.

To understand how global warming can be kept well below 2 degrees Celsius and even 1.5 degrees Celsius, climate policy uses scenarios that describe how society could reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. However, current scenarios have a key weakness: they typically focus on reaching specific climate goals in 2100. This choice may encourage risky pathways that delay action, reach higher-than-acceptable mid-century warming, and rely on net removal of carbon dioxide thereafter to undo their initial shortfall in reductions of emissions. Here we draw on insights from physical science to propose a scenario framework that focuses on capping global warming at a specific maximum level with either temperature stabilization or reversal thereafter. The ambition of climate action until carbon neutrality determines peak warming, and can be followed by a variety of long-term states with different sustainability implications. The approach proposed here closely mirrors the intentions of the United Nations Paris Agreement, and makes questions of intergenerational equity into explicit design choices.

### Embedding non-communicable diseases in the post-2015 development agenda [^114GWVdM]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

The post-2015 development agenda will build on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), in which health is a core component. This agenda will focus on human development, incorporate the components of the Millennium Declaration, and will be made sustainable by support from the social, economic, and environmental domains of activity, represented graphically as the strands of a triple helix. The approaches to prevention and control of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have been elaborated in the political declaration of the UN high-level meeting on NCDs and governments have adopted a goal of 25% reduction in relative mortality from NCDs by 2025 (the 25 by 25 goal), but a strong movement is needed based on the evidence already available, enhanced by effective partnerships, and with political support to ensure that NCDs are embedded in the post-2015 human development agenda. NCDs should be embedded in the post-2015 development agenda, since they are leading causes of death and disability, have a negative effect on health, and, through their effect on the societal, economic, and the environmental domains, impair the sustainability of development. Some drivers of unsustainable development, such as the transport, food and agriculture, and energy sectors, also increase the risk of NCDs.

### Exploring pathways for world development within planetary boundaries [^111yuGjo]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

The pressures humanity has been placing on the environment have put Earth's stability at risk. The planetary boundaries framework serves as a method to define a 'safe operating space for humanity' 1,2 and has so far been applied mostly to highlight the currently prevailing unsustainable environmental conditions. The ability to evaluate trends over time, however, can help us explore the consequences of alternative policy decisions and identify pathways for living within planetary boundaries 3. Here we use the Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment 4 to project control variables for eight out of nine planetary boundaries under alternative scenarios to 2050, both with and without strong environmental policy measures. The results show that, with current trends and policies, the situation is projected to worsen to 2050 for all planetary boundaries, except for ozone depletion. Targeted interventions, such as implementing the Paris climate agreement, a shift to a healthier diet, improved food, and water- and nutrient-use efficiency, can effectively reduce the degree of transgression of the planetary boundaries, steering humanity towards a more sustainable trajectory (that is, if they can be implemented based on social and institutional feasibility considerations). However, even in this scenario, several planetary boundaries, including climate change, biogeochemical flows and biodiversity, will remain transgressed in 2050, partly as result of inertia. This means that more-effective policy measures will be needed to ensure we are living well within the planetary boundaries.

### Assistance, protection, and governance networks in complex emergencies [^116sxnTH]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

This article presents an introduction to the causes and characteristics of armed conflicts. It reviews some of the key humanitarian crises that broke new ground in terms of the technologies and practices that developed at the field level in response to each new complex emergency, with particular focus on the health sector. It introduces the concept of humanitarian governance as a framework for addressing the consequences and implications of the failure of worldwide governance for the protection of civilians in armed conflict. Here, we term humanitarian governance to include the use of international humanitarian law and human rights instruments to govern the behaviour of state and non-state organisations in conflict zones in a way that protects the lives and livelihoods of affected populations. We note, however, that terrorist concerns appear to be replacing humanitarian logic in the network of worldwide governance.

### Relational identity theory: a systematic approach for transforming the emotional dimension of conflict [^117KjpAA]. The American Psychologist (2010). Low credibility.

Emotions are a vital dimension in conflicts among nation-states and communities affiliated by common ethnic, economic, or political interests. Yet the individuals most responsible for managing such conflicts — heads of state, CEOs, intellectual or religious leaders — are often blind to the psychological forces affecting their interests. During 20 years of international research, consulting, and teaching, I have developed a program for teaching thought leaders how to apply psychological principles to achieve their aims while also reducing negative outcomes such as violence, social upheaval, and economic displacement. In this article, I present relational identity theory (RIT), a theoretical and intellectual framework I have originated to help people understand and deal with key emotional dimensions of conflict management. I argue that national and communal bonds are essentially tribal in nature, and I describe how a tribe's unaddressed relational identity concerns make it susceptible to what I term the tribes effect, a rigidification of its relational identity. I provide strategies based on RIT for mitigating the tribes effect and thus enhancing global security.

### Prevalence of perceived food and housing security-15 States, 2013 [^1128FnZz]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Achieving health equity by improving food and housing security is a major objective of CDC's Division of Community Health (DCH) programs, such as Partnerships to Improve Community Health and Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health. § With support from DCH, many communities are working to make healthy food choices easier for persons who live in food deserts (parts of a community offering little to no fresh fruit, vegetables, and other healthy whole foods), with emphasis on increased access to healthy, affordable foods and alternative payment options. These initiatives are examples of policy, systems, or environmental approaches that create opportunities for health and maximize the ability of all segments of the population to achieve optimal health. The overarching strategy is to change the community context to make the healthy choice the default choice.

Deciding where to target interventions and determining which interventions have the most impact on reducing health disparities will require an improved understanding of social determinants. The BRFSS food and housing security questions could play an important role in three ways: monitoring food and housing security over time, identifying vulnerable populations that are highest priority for intervention, and evaluating the effectiveness of these interventions. The concise nature of the Social Context Module's single-question format for food and housing security makes it possible to incorporate these questions into large health surveys to conduct nationwide monitoring of social determinants.

### Global property rights and land use efficiency [^112RLv59]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In civil law countries with weak state capacity, the prevalence of low LUE is more pronounced. Venezuela's land reform and agricultural policies have sparked intense disputes between the state and rural workers, leading to profound conflicts and disparities in rural areas that underscore the tension between state policies and peasant needs. Haiti, as a fragile state grappling with poverty, weak governance, natural disasters, and environmental degradation, experiences exacerbated land use inefficiencies due to weaknesses in civil law and property rights. However, recent efforts towards land registration in Ethiopia demonstrate that formalizing land rights can substantially enhance investments related to land and foster greater participation in the land rental market.

This study, which primarily investigates the relationship between secure land property rights and LUE, incorporates control variables such as GDP per capita, infrastructure quality, and regulatory quality to account for the impact of various external factors. However, it is essential to acknowledge that property utilization is also significantly influenced by a wide array of social and political factors. While our research has considered the effects of economic development and state capacity by proxy variables, the role of social attitudes in shaping land use patterns on a macro scale has not been thoroughly examined. Indigenous perspectives on collective land management, for example, are deeply rooted in cultural, spiritual, and historical connections to the land, emphasizing stewardship, sustainability, and the incorporation of traditional knowledge into land-use practices — a critical aspect that our study has not yet addressed. Furthermore, the state's capacity and societal attitudes may impact property usage through complex mechanisms, suggesting that their broader implications warrant more in-depth investigation in future research. Another limitation is that while case studies on typical studies provide valuable data support, their representativeness may not fully capture the impact of all legal types, especially for high-income countries like France. Therefore, it is recommended that future research include important civil law countries such as France in case analyses to further validate the conclusions of this study. Additionally, due to limited information, this paper has not conducted an in-depth investigation into the role of property rights in countries that have undergone substantial population decline. Future research should focus on conducting further studies on these countries. Lastly, if a more suitable index for measuring SLPR can be identified to replace the Fraser index, it would enhance the credibility of research findings, which will be discussed in the following section.

### The key role of sufficiency for low demand-based carbon neutrality and energy security across Europe [^117WNKtD]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Future work should build upon this by assessing how variations in income inequality impact access to energy services and the resulting compatibility with decent living energy thresholds. Sufficient analysis also needs to be given to how policy measures must be designed not only to ensure that the sufficiency corridor is achieved on average per country, but also to ensure fair distribution within countries so that minimum standards are achieved for each person.

As for renewables and efficiency potentials, the realisation of sufficiency potentials and its fair distribution is contingent on a respective policy framework, partly in interdependence with deeper cultural and social changes. However, sufficiency does not play a major role in policy frameworks of existing scenarios yet, as renewable energies and efficiency are usually the dominant strategies in rather technology-focused narratives. In the present scenario, policies were not modelled in detail, but instruments have been outlined for all sectors. In the Supplementary Data 1, about 100 policy measures are listed. Additionally, for a better overview, a summary of main policy strategies per sector pursued by sufficiency policies within the CLEVER scenario, and examples for specific instruments. Some of the policy measures are not only aimed at achieving the sufficiency corridor per country in Europe, but also explicitly at ensuring that every individual within the country achieves the basis for a good life.

Sufficiency policy mixes require a range of instrument types, regulative but also fiscal and information policies –. Effective policy mixes are characterised by consistency (to exclude contradictions), coherence (to use synergies between instruments) and comprehensiveness (to support the full range of strategies for a shift to a 100% renewable energy system).

The instrument mix proposed to achieve the CLEVER scenario varies by sector and mostly targets structural changes (by regulation, economic instruments, education) rather than individual behaviour (information). In contrast to the present European National Energy and Climate Plans, all sectors include a large share of regulatory sufficiency measures (20%-50%). For an overview graph of instrument types per sector, see the Supplementary Fig. 5. This approach of mixed policy instruments resonates with the recommendations of Climate Citizen Assemblies in European countries, which additionally call for a regulatory framework in climate policy, where the state sets clear rules rather than relying on price and market instruments. The strong focus of citizens' assemblies on sufficiency measures to combat climate change can also be interpreted as an indication that the cultural and social changes required for comprehensive sufficiency have already begun.

### A systemic risk assessment methodological framework for the global polycrisis [^113vfi4M]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Food and energy system entangled crises as a lens for developing a systemic risk framework

In a highly interconnected world where risks have the potential to cascade across systems, regions and scales, systemic risk assessment potentially encompasses a consideration of everything. However, some bounding is required to keep consideration of risks tractable. Here, we start with a specific pair of systems (global food and energy systems) to act as a lens through which to consider a range of systems and their interrelated risks.

Focusing on these two systems and their interconnections is salient for a number of reasons. Energy systems power all socio-economic activity, including input into agriculture. Food systems are vital for addressing hunger and poverty, whilst lower energy poverty is closely correlated with higher health and educational outcomes. Yet more than 2 billion people worldwide are experiencing food insecuritywhilst nearly 800 million people still lack access to electricity (and this number increased in 2022). From a moral, as well as economic and social, standpoint, understanding the risks to food and energy systems is therefore critical. Second, food and energy systems crises are often closely related to other crises, including financial crises, extreme weather events, conflicts as well as disruptions to international and national supply chains. Third, the potential impacts of food and energy systems on other systems is considerable. The global food system is responsible for a third of greenhouse gas emissions, whilst energy use, through the burning of fossil fuels (some of which occur in the food system), is responsible for over 70% of current greenhouse gas emissions. Both systems help drive land use change, water consumption and chemical pollution.

### Increasing compliance with international pandemic law: international relations and new global health agreements [^113P2meS]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

Across multiple pandemics, global health governance institutions have struggled to secure the compliance of states with international legal and political commitments, ranging from data sharing to observing WHO guidance to sharing vaccines. In response, governments are negotiating a new pandemic treaty and revising the International Health Regulations. Achieving compliance remains challenging, but international relations and international law research in areas outside of health offers insights. This Health Policy analyses international relations research on the reasons why states comply with international law, even in the absence of sanctions. Drawing on human rights, trade, finance, tobacco, and environmental law, we categorise compliance mechanisms as police patrol, fire alarm, or community organiser models. We show that, to date, current and proposed global health law incorporates only a few of the mechanisms that have shown to be effective in other areas. We offer six specific, politically feasible mechanisms for new international agreements that, together, could create compliance pressures to shift state behaviour.

### Assessing global sustainability performance, imbalance, and coordination over space and time [^112S9Dhb]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Challenges, such as hunger, water scarcity, energy shortages, chemical pollution, gender inequality, and climate change threaten global sustainability –. For example, around 815 million people experience chronic food shortages, 4 billion face water scarcity, and 1.2 billion have no access to electricity. To achieve global sustainability and improve human well-being, 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted by the United Nations (UN) General Assembly in 2015, to which 193 countries have committed. The 17 SDGs are an expansion and refinement of the eight Millennium Development Goals adopted in 2000 and offer a more detailed framework of sustainable development. They provide a platform for sustainable development to facilitate global sustainability across scales.

Sustainable development and sustainability have garnered considerable attention from researchers and organizations worldwide, serving as the conceptual foundation guiding modern social, economic, and environmental paradigms. These include the green economy –, circular economy –, agricultural sustainability –, and urban sustainability. Sustainability is commonly structured around the three pillars of people, planet, and prosperity. Sustainable development traditionally emphasized the social, environmental, and economic dimensions, as well as their interactions. Various perspectives have been proposed for analyzing these pillars and their interactions, with three dominant perspectives emerging: weak, strong, and integrated sustainability. Weak sustainability treats each pillar of sustainable development (social, environmental, and economic) as equally important, whereas strong sustainability attaches the greatest importance to the environmental pillar. Integrated sustainability, a perspective of sustainable development, introduces spillover effects as the fourth and critical pillar of sustainable development. To analyze these sustainable development spillover effects across global regions, the index of sustainability elasticities has been developed. Positive sustainability elasticities indicate the synergetic relationships, while negative values show trade-offs between regions. In the integrated sustainability perspective, the SDGs can align with each pillar of sustainable development, including social (SDGs 3, 4, 5, and 10), environmental (SDGs 6, 12, 13, 14, and 15), economic (SDGs 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, and 11), and spillover (SDGs 16 and 17) pillars of sustainable development. As a global platform for sustainable development, the SDGs offer a unified and comprehensive framework for studying global sustainability in an integrated sustainability perspective –. To gain a deeper understanding and analysis of integrated sustainability, it is essential to first comprehend the performance of sustainable development across multiple levels, examining its imbalance and coordination over time.

### National research ecosystems: protecting populations and building health security worldwide [^11159CWY]. The Lancet: Global Health (2025). High credibility.

The global clinical research enterprise remains fundamentally misaligned with worldwide disease burden and public health needs, despite corrective efforts in recent years. Although clinical trials deliver important medical advances that benefit populations globally, research capabilities and trials are concentrated in high-income countries, which means that populations with the heaviest disease burdens (often in low-income and middle-income countries) participate in relatively few trials addressing their needs-infectious and non-communicable diseases alike. This imbalance leaves knowledge gaps in treating the most prevalent diseases and leaves the world dangerously unprepared for emerging threats. In this Viewpoint, we advance a vision of strong national research ecosystems that prioritise national and regional health needs, are integrated into health systems for rapid incorporation of research results into health care, and are prepared to pivot to emergency research when needed. This vision and the investment it requires-both domestic and international-are essential to improving and protecting population health.

### Family conflict, emotional security, and child development: translating research findings into a prevention program for community families [^111k811w]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2012). Low credibility.

The social problem posed by family conflict to the physical and psychological health and well-being of children, parents, and underlying family relationships is a cause for concern. Inter-parental and parent-child conflict are linked with children's behavioral, emotional, social, academic, and health problems, with children's risk particularly elevated in distressed marriages. Supported by the promise of brief psycho-educational programs (e.g. Halford et al. in Journal of Family Psychology 22:497–505, 2008; Sanders in Journal of Family Psychology 22:506–517, 2008), the present paper presents the development and evaluation of a prevention program for community families with children, concerned with family-wide conflict and relationships, and building on Emotional Security Theory (Davies and Cummings in Psychological Bulletin 116:387–411, 1994). This program uniquely focuses on translating research and theory in this area into brief, engaging programs for community families to improve conflict and emotional security for the sake of the children. Evaluation is based on multi-domain and multi-method assessments of family-wide and child outcomes in the context of a randomized control design. A series of studies are briefly described in the programmatic development of a prevention program for conflict and emotional security for community families, culminating in a program for family-wide conflict and emotional security for families with adolescents. With regard to this ongoing program, evidence is presented at the post-test for improvements in family-wide functioning, consideration of the relative benefits for different groups within the community, and preliminary support for the theoretical bases for program outcomes.

### Can current interlinked crises stimulate the structural and policy choices required for healthy societies? [^113rbcVx]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

For healthy societies to be an outcome of current crises, proponents of health equity should provide evidence to guide this framing of the causes and accountability for crises. They also should support social movements to demand action to influence policy outcomes, minimise indifference to the root causes of crises among communities, and direct blame for crises in ways that increase rather than detract from health equity.

Building healthy societies will require coalitions within countries and globally of governments, civil society, academia, and the private sector to present credibly what each part of government, each part of society, and each person can contribute, and to foster social mobilisation to support the improvements needed in systems and governance. We need to reach a consensus in our societies on the causes of current crises and what needs to be done. The health sector must urgently improve its capacity and performance to play its part, even though it is only one contributor, and often a minor one, in many of the required transformations. It will take humility and sensitivity to avoid being seen as using the resources of people and other sectors for narrow technocratic public health ends. Instead, the health sector will need to engage with the public's interests and priorities and be willing to make trade-offs and persuade, generously and credibly with evidence and a spirit of solidarity, to get support for creation and preservation of healthy societies.

Key messages

The current multiple interlinked crises provide opportunities for transformative action to enact healthy societies and improve social, economic, and environmental equity.
While the understanding of what constitutes a healthy society varies, common features can be identified drawing on existing concepts related to health equity.
Key structural and policy choices to realise healthy societies will require action across all sectors, not just health.
Evidence, research, and learning should frame and interpret the current crises in ways that support these choices.

### Advancing Germany's new global health strategy [^111UZaSo]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

First, priorities in the global health strategy, as well as the principles underpinning the adopted decisions, should be documented in a transparent manner. This includes documenting the supporting research evidence, as well as an explicit and critical reflection on the normative reasoning applied (eg, why research on obesity was selected as a priority over neglected tropical disease, or vice versa).
Second, an effective management of conflict of interest should make the involvement of different stakeholders and their specific contributions public. This allows for public scrutiny and an open discussion to determine whether any conflicting interests of stakeholders have been addressed and balanced out in an acceptable manner.
Third, the input already provided by the five stakeholder groups should truly be taken into consideration during the interministerial decision-making processes. To further enhance public participation, drafts of the strategy should be made available to selected stakeholder groups or the public at critical transition points, allowing for appeal and revision. It may also be helpful to examine the forms of public participation that countries, such as Canada, the UK, the Netherlands or Switzerland, have used for making strategic health decisions.
Fourth, in the light of global health being a holistic, multisectoral and transdisciplinary concept, the government should critically reflect on the stakeholders to be consulted within Germany. The current dominance of the medical and healthcare sector may need to be redressed to include a broader range of disciplines (eg, sociology, ethics) and sectors (eg, economics, agriculture, environment), in particular in view of complex multisectoral global health challenges, such as mitigating and/or adapting to climate change in the light of its health impacts.
Fifth, as the new German global health strategy is likely to have a profound impact on populations in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), representatives of their populations should be given the opportunity to directly voice their interests and concerns, too. We therefore welcome the expansion of the International Advisory Board on Global Health in July 2018, which now includes three (out of ten) members from LMICs. However, two of these are current or former WHO staff, with the third representing a think tank from a middle-income country, suggesting that the nomination of additional LMIC stakeholders (eg, representing civil rights, poverty action or patient organisations) may be warranted.
Last, once the new German global health strategy is adopted, the government should monitor its implementation on a regular basis, evaluate its successes and failures, and make adjustments where necessary. At these stages and tasks should the government strive for public participation and transparency.

### 'Knowing how the machine works': a novel framework for engaging with the political determinants of health [^1139F4bD]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Policy space

Is there sufficient common ground among political contenders to advance change? Our Q-studiesfind that, across all four countries, public actors at the national and local levels, the private sector and civil society cluster around two policy perspectives. First, all stakeholders in all countries reject policy options that maintain the status quo. Such fundamental agreement is conducive to initiating a policy process. Second, the appetite for fundamental legal reform is limited. Only the two perspectives in Ghana and one in Burkina Faso prioritise comprehensive legal reform, either by introducing an HIA law or by including public health in EIA legislation. All other perspectives do not prioritise legal reform, suggesting that they do not attribute the current underperformance to missing legal provisions. This is relevant because donors often suggest legal reforms to address issues identified.

Third, all countries prioritise implementation-focused measures. Including public health in the companies' management plan, collecting baseline data for effective monitoring and the possibility of imposing effective fines consistently rank among the highest priorities. The emphasis on monitoring and compliance reflects the experience that EIA performance does not suffer from missing regulations but from an implementation deficit. Fourth, all perspectives in all countries explicitly rule out the idea that the private sector self-regulates. Private governance is supported by donors, international organisations and the industry, but is not recognised by host country actors as a legitimate and credible custodian of public health due to conflicts of interest. However, both perspectives in Tanzania and one in Mozambique call for more funding from mining companies for the local health system. This view is particularly emphasised by study participants from subnational levels, where the mining companies' capacity and resources are part of the daily experience.

Finally, important opportunities and tensions emerge, too. Private sector representatives signal varying degrees of openness to accepting responsibilities for protecting public health. Fault lines emerge within the public sector. The first falls between those tasked to promote foreign direct investment in mining and those concerned with mitigating negative externalities. Leveraging the previously observed support from the industry could help overcome this divide. Second, friction is visible between the Ministries of Environment, responsible for environmental monitoring, and the Ministries of Health, as they might compete for funds, staff and influence. Finally, tensions arise between the central and local levels over the competencies that local-level health system actors should be entrusted with for monitoring and enforcement.

### Engaging globally with how to achieve healthy societies: insights from India, Latin America and east and Southern Africa [^111LdWks]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Paradigm choices take us to significantly different futures

We are more informed than ever of the challenges we face to healthy societies in our way of life, production and consumption patterns, environmental degradation and in the extreme social inequality generated in the current global political economy. By the 2020s, two profound global conditions with significant local and national impact provide a useful insight on the critical point we have reached for the way we think and act on these challenges.

The first, the COVID-19 pandemic, is providing evidence of the insufficiency of and inequity generated by reactive, nationally self-protective, singularly biomedical-focused approaches to health emergencies. Such approaches ignore and thus fail to remedy the deeper structural drivers of 'emergencies'. They discount the critical contribution of comprehensive, equity-and rights-based, participatory and ecological approaches, or of a reassertion of early ideas of reciprocity and collective interests in health.

A second challenge lies in climate change and extreme biodiversity losses, their existential threat to healthy societies and the proactive reciprocal, collective cooperation they call for. As these planetary threats become increasingly immediate and more widely understood, they are stimulating a new understanding of interdependency; new forms of international cooperation reflecting collective interests and new demands to tackle the vested interests and power imbalances that undermine sustainable and equitable patterns of production and consumption, reasserting early ideas of health demanding harmony with nature.

Pandemics and climate change as manifestations of global crises show a potential of significantly different futures in the dominant thinking about and shaping of healthy societies. We live in a Gramscian moment of old and new ideas, where health threats are responded to by reviving old coercive public health approaches that leave many determinants unaddressed, even while new frameworks for global cooperation and collective responsibilities are advocated.

At this critical moment of choice, the social constructivist analysis suggests that we look not only to ideas advanced by elites and states for what assumes dominance, but also to those promoted by social actors. A key driver of healthy societies may thus be when sufficient people in communities, countries, regions and global institutions converge in seeing an unhealthy status quo as no longer acceptable; when we have generated the space and processes to fairly share and build ideas that benefit, are understood and embraced by the wider public; and when we have the confidence and assert the collective power to produce change.

### Assessment of neurodevelopment, nutrition, and inflammation from fetal life to adolescence in low-resource settings [^1142s2Z1]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Efforts to improve child neurodevelopment are critical to health, equity, and sustainable development, particularly in low-resource settings in the United States and globally. The colliding epidemics of food insecurity, infectious diseases, and noncommunicable diseases interact and impact neurodevelopment. Understanding the complex relationships between nutrition, inflammation, and neurodevelopment can inform clinical and public health interventions to improve outcomes. This article reviews key definitions, tools, and considerations for the assessment of nutrition, inflammation, and child neurodevelopment. The effectiveness of existing assessment tools to reflect status and biology, particularly in relation to each other, and to predict long-term changes in health is examined. The aim of this review is to present the extant evidence, identify critical research gaps, and suggest a research agenda for future longitudinal and intervention studies to address the assessment of nutrition, inflammation, and child neurodevelopment, particularly in low-resource settings. Despite research gaps, there is a strong relationship between nutrition, inflammation, environmental factors, and child neurodevelopment, which emphasizes the need to evaluate targeted, early interventions to improve long-term health and well-being.

### The 2020 report of the Lancet countdown on health and climate change: responding to converging crises [^114hFjBq]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Executive summary

The Lancet Countdown is an international collaboration established to provide an independent, global monitoring system dedicated to tracking the emerging health profile of the changing climate.

The 2020 report presents 43 indicators across five sections: climate change impacts, exposures, and vulnerabilities; adaptation, planning, and resilience for health; mitigation actions and health co-benefits; economics and finance; and public and political engagement. This report represents the findings and consensus of the 35 leading academic institutions and UN agencies that make up the Lancet Countdown, and draws on the expertise of climate scientists, geographers, engineers, experts in energy, food, and transport, economists, social, and political scientists, data scientists, public health professionals, and doctors.

The emerging health profile of the changing climate

5 years ago, countries committed to limit global warming to "well below 2°C" as part of the landmark Paris Agreement. 5 years on, global carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions continue to rise steadily, with no convincing or sustained abatement, resulting in a rise in the global average temperature of 1.2°C. Indeed, the five hottest years on record have occurred since 2015.

The changing climate has already produced considerable shifts in the underlying social and environmental determinants of health at the global level. Indicators in all domains of section 1 (climate change impacts, exposures, and vulnerabilities) are worsening. Concerning, and often accelerating, trends were seen for each of the human symptoms of climate change monitored, with the 2020 indicators presenting the most worrying outlook reported since the Lancet Countdown was first established.

These effects are often unequal, disproportionately impacting populations who have contributed the least to the problem. This fact reveals a deeper question of justice, whereby climate change interacts with existing social and economic inequalities and exacerbates longstanding trends within and between countries. An examination of the causes of climate change revealed similar issues, and many carbon-intensive practices and policies lead to poor air quality, poor food quality, and poor housing quality, which disproportionately harm the health of disadvantaged populations.

Vulnerable populations were exposed to an additional 475 million heatwave events globally in 2019, which was, in turn, reflected in excess morbidity and mortality (indicator 1.1.2). During the past 20 years, there has been a 53.7% increase in heat-related mortality in people older than 65 years, reaching a total of 296 000 deaths in 2018 (indicator 1.1.3). The high cost in terms of human lives and suffering is associated with effects on economic output, with 302 billion h of potential labour capacity lost in 2019 (indicator 1.1.4). India and Indonesia were among the worst affected countries, seeing losses of potential labour capacity equivalent to 4–6% of their annual gross domestic product (indicator 4.1.3). In Europe in 2018, the monetised cost of heat-related mortality was equivalent to 1.2% of regional gross national income, or the average income of 11 million European citizens (indicator 4.1.2).

Turning to extremes of weather, advancements in climate science allow for greater accuracy and certainty in attribution; studies from 2015 to 2020 have shown the fingerprints of climate change in 76 floods, droughts, storms, and temperature anomalies (indicator 1.2.3). Furthermore, there was an increase in the number of days people were exposed to a very high or extremely high risk of wildfire between 2001–04 and 2016–19 in 114 countries (indicator 1.2.1). Correspondingly, 67% of global cities surveyed expected climate change to seriously compromise their public health assets and infrastructure (indicator 2.1.3).

The changing climate has downstream effects, impacting broader environmental systems, which in turn harm human health. Global food security is threatened by rising temperatures and increases in the frequency of extreme events; global yield potential for major crops declined by 1.8–5.6% between 1981 and 2019 (indicator 1.4.1). The climate suitability for infectious disease transmission has been growing rapidly since the 1950s, with a 15.0% increase for dengue caused by Aedes albopictus in 2018, and regional increases for malaria and Vibrio bacteria (indicator 1.3.1). Projecting forward, based on current populations, between 145 million people and 565 million people face potential inundation from rising sea levels (indicator 1.5).

Despite these clear and escalating signs, the global response to climate change has been muted and national efforts continue to fall short of the commitments made in the Paris Agreement. The carbon intensity of the global energy system has remained almost flat for 30 years, with global coal use increasing by 74% during this time (indicators 3.1.1 and 3.1.2). The reduction in global coal use that had been observed since 2013 has now reversed for the past 2 consecutive years: coal use rose by 1.7% from 2016 to 2018. The health burden is substantial — more than 1 million deaths occur every year as a result of air pollution from coal-fired power, and some 390 000 of these deaths were a result of particulate pollution in 2018 (indicator 3.3). The response in the food and agricultural sector has been similarly concerning. Emissions from livestock grew by 16% from 2000 to 2017, with 93% of emissions coming from ruminant animals (indicator 3.5.1). Likewise, increasingly unhealthy diets are becoming more common worldwide, with excess red meat consumption contributing to some 990 000 deaths in 2017 (indicator 3.5.2). 5 years on from when countries reached an agreement in Paris, a concerning number of indicators are showing an early, but sustained, reversal of previously positive trends identified in past reports (indicators 1.3.2, 3.1.2, and 4.2.3).

A growing response from health professionals

Despite little economy-wide improvement, relative gains have been made in several key sectors: from 2010 to 2017, the average annual growth rate in renewable energy capacity was 21%, and low-carbon electricity was responsible for 28% of capacity in China in 2017 (indicator 3.1.3). However, the indicators presented in the 2020 report of the Lancet Countdown suggest that some of the most considerable progress was seen in the growing momentum of the health profession's engagement with climate change globally. Doctors, nurses, and the broader profession have a central role in health system adaptation and mitigation, in understanding and maximising the health benefits of any intervention, and in communicating the need for an accelerated response.

In the case of adaptation in national health systems, this change is underway. Impressively, health services in 86 countries are now connected with their equivalent meteorological services to assist in health adaptation planning (indicator 2.2). At least 51 countries have developed plans for national health adaptation, and global spending in health adaptation rose to 5.3% of all adaptation spending in 2018–19, reaching US$18.4 billion in 2019 (indicators 2.1.1 and 2.4).

The health-care sector, which was responsible for 4.6% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2017, is taking early but important steps to reduce its own emissions (indicator 3.6). In the UK, the National Health Service has declared an ambition to deliver a net-zero health service as soon as possible, building on a decade of impressive progress in reducing delivery of care emissions by 57% since 1990, and by 22% when considering the service's supply chain and broader responsibilities. Elsewhere, the Western Australian Department of Health used its 2016 Public Health Act to conduct Australia's first climate and health inquiry, and the German Federal Ministry of Health has established a dedicated department on health protection and sustainability responsible for climate-related matters. This progress is becoming more evenly distributed around the world, with 73% of countries making explicit references to health and wellbeing in their Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement, and 100% of countries in the South-East Asia and Eastern Mediterranean regions doing so (indicator 5.4). Similarly, least-developed countries and small island developing states are providing increasing global leadership within the UN General Debate on the connections between health and climate change (indicator 5.4).

Individual health professionals and their associations are also responding well, with health institutions committing to divest more than $42 billion worth of assets from fossil fuels (indicator 4.2.4). In academia, the publication of original research on health and climate changed has increased by a factor of eight from 2007 to 2019 (indicator 5.3).

These shifts are being translated into the broader public discourse. From 2018 to 2019, the coverage of health and climate change in the media increased by 96% world-wide, outpacing the increased coverage of climate change overall, and reaching the highest observed point to date (indicator 5.1). Just as it did with advancements in sanitation and hygiene and with tobacco control, growing and sustained engagement from the health profession during the past 5 years is now beginning to fill a crucial gap in the global response to climate change.

The next 5 years: a joint response to two public health crises

Dec 12, 2020, will mark the anniversary of the 2015 Paris Agreement, with countries set to update their national commitments and review these commitments every 5 years. These next 5 years will be pivotal. To reach the 1.5°C target and limit temperature rise to "well below 2°C", the 56 gigatonnes of CO 2 equivalent (GtCO 2 e) currently emitted annually will need to drop to 25 GtCO 2 e within only 10 years (by 2030). In effect, this decrease will require a 7.6% reduction every year, representing an increase in current levels of national government ambition of a factor of five. Without further intervention during the next 5 years, the reductions required to achieve this target increase to 15.4% every year, moving the 1.5°C target out of reach.

The need for accelerated efforts to tackle climate change during the next 5 years will be contextualised by the impacts of, and the global response to, the COVID-19 pandemic. With the loss of life from the pandemic and from climate change measured in the hundreds of thousands, the potential economic costs measured in the trillions, and the broader consequences expected to continue for years to come, the measures taken to address both of these public health crises must be carefully examined and closely linked. Health professionals are well placed to act as a bridge between the two issues, and analogically considering the clinical approach to managing a patient with COVID-19 might be useful in understanding the ways in which these two public health crises should be jointly addressed.

First, in an acute setting, a high priority is placed on rapidly diagnosing and comprehensively assessing the situation. Likewise, further work is required to understand the problem, including: which populations are vulnerable to both the pandemic and to climate change; how global and national economies have reacted and adapted, and the health and environmental consequences of these actions; and which aspects of these shifts should be retained to support longer term, sustainable development. Second, appropriate resuscitation and treatment options are reviewed and administered, with careful consideration of any potential side-effects, the goals of care, and the life-long health of the patient. Economic recovery packages that prioritise outdated forms of energy and transport that are fossil fuel intensive will have unintended side-effects, unnecessarily adding to the 7 million people that die every year from air pollution. Instead, investments in health imperatives, such as renewable energy and clean air, active travel infrastructure and physical activity, and resilient and climate-smart health care, will ultimately be more effective than these outdated methods.

Finally, attention turns to secondary prevention and long-term recovery, seeking to minimise the permanent effects of the disease and prevent recurrence. Many of the steps taken to prepare for unexpected shocks, such as a pandemic, are similar to those required to adapt to the extremes of weather and new threats expected from climate change. These steps include the need to identify vulnerable populations, assess the capacity of public health systems, develop and invest in preparedness measures, and emphasise community resilience and equity. Indeed, without considering the current and future impacts of climate change, efforts to prepare for future pandemics are likely to be undermined.

At every step and in both cases, acting with a level of urgency proportionate to the scale of the threat, adhering to the best available science, and practising clear and consistent communications, are paramount. The consequences of the pandemic will contextualise the economic, social, and environmental policies of governments during the next 5 years, a period that is crucial in determining whether temperatures will remain "well below 2°C". Unless the global COVID-19 recovery is aligned with the response to climate change, the world will fail to meet the target laid out in the Paris Agreement, damaging public health in the short term and long term.

### Managing the pursuit of health and wealth: the key challenges [^115JFWrw]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

This article forms part of a six-part Series on trade and health, and sets the stage for this Series by analysing key aspects of the relationship between trade and health. The Series takes stock of this relation and provides timely analysis of the key challenges facing efforts to achieve an appropriate balance between trade and health across a diverse range of issues. This introductory article reviews how trade and health have risen and expanded on global policy agendas in the past decade in unprecedented ways, describes how trade and health issues are respectively governed in international relations, examines the ongoing search for policy coherence between the two policy spheres, and highlights the topics of the remaining articles in the Series.

### Priorities for consent-based and well-supported climate relocations [^116CPE3d]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The planned, coordinated, and collective movement of people to new, safer sites, in anticipation or response to natural hazards, is often called planned relocation. These relocation processes are conceptually distinct from uncoordinated displacement and migration, which typically involve individual or household-level decision-making. Unlike evacuations, relocations are also intended to be permanent. Although some rare relocations are carried out autonomously by communities drawing on their own resources, the state typically plays an important role in securing land and covering costs. Climate-related planned relocations of communities from hazard-exposed areas are already occurring globally.

Planned relocations can be an important adaptation strategy, benefiting people by reducing climate-related risk while minimizing disruptions to community and social cohesion. However, past relocations have often resulted in negative outcomes. Examples abound of poorly planned relocations that have led to increased risk exposure, livelihood loss, declining living conditions, and social, cultural and emotional damage, involving often severe human rights violations. Although exposure to climate risk does not automatically lead to mobility, more relocations may be likely as intensifying climatic impacts raise reasonable concerns about the long-term habitability of many areas. Projected annual flood levels for 2050, for example, could affect 340 million people globally. Yet the window of opportunity to learn from these past mistakes is rapidly closing.

Issuing general recommendations for planned relocations is difficult, as no two relocations are the same, even within one country. Indeed they are complex multi-stakeholder processes that require iterative risk and vulnerability assessments, consultative decision-making, planning, implementation, and long-term monitoring, all of which are culturally, geographically and politically context-dependent. As a result, the term "planned relocation" is applied to situations marked by very different community needs, capacities and preferences, and across national contexts with wide-ranging institutional, economic, and political capacity. But using this term broadly and universalizing across contexts can be problematic.

To navigate differences across contexts, conceptual frameworks comparing and categorising relocation cases are essential. They help stakeholders involved in relocation decision-making identify broadly applicable lessons without overgeneralizing and obscuring context-specific needs. Here we develop a framework for researchers, communities and their advocates to identify priorities for advocacy to relevant government authorities, and ultimately ensure more consensual and well-supported relocation practice.

### Primary prevention of dementia: an ethical review [^1115y6ZV]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Dementia poses important medical and societal challenges, and of all health risks people face in life, dementia is one of the most feared. Recent research indicates that up to about 40% of all cases of dementia might be preventable. A series of environmental, social, and medical risk-factors have been identified that should be targeted from midlife onwards when people are still cognitively healthy. At first glance, this seems not merely advisable, but even imperative. However, these new developments trigger a series of new ethical questions and concerns which have hardly been addressed to date. Pro-active ethical reflection, however, is crucial to ensure that the interests and well-being of those affected, ultimately all of us, are adequately respected. This is the goal of the current contribution. Against the background of a concrete case in primary dementia prevention, it provides a systematic overview of the current ethical literature and sketches an ethical research agenda. First, possible benefits of increased well-being must be balanced with the burdens of being engaged in particularly long-term interventions for which it is unclear whether they will ever pay out on a personal level. Second, while knowledge about one's options to maintain brain health might empower people, it might also undermine autonomy, put high social pressure on people, medicalize healthy adults, and stigmatize those who still develop dementia. Third, while synergistic effects might occur, the ideals of dementia prevention might also conflict with other health and non-health related values people hold in life.

### City footprints and SDGs provide untapped potential for assessing city sustainability [^111SUDN5]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

The UN 2030 Agenda and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)specify national ownership, with monitoring and implementation primarily targeted at the global and national levels. However, there is emerging practice in downscaling the SDGs to the sub-national leveland for cities –. Cities in particular have been regarded as central to driving the sustainable development agenda in several ways. Cities exert a profound and far-reaching influence on the environment and societies outside their boundaries because of their population density, economic significance, affluence and ensuing global resource requirements. But cities are also centres of knowledge, technology and innovation, which makes them crucial players in any sustainability transition. Key to the success of cities in implementing the SDGs will be meaningful monitoring and target setting, based on metrics that show progress towards sustainability in relative and absolute terms. However challenges remain in downscaling targets and indicators to the city level to support planning and policy in a local context.

In addition to the emerging SDG city assessment literature, many studies have calculated the environmental footprints of cities to quantify their extended global impact from a consumption perspective –. This is particularly important for cities, since their populations cannot be sustained without inputs of resources and services from regional and global hinterlands. Footprints are metrics that account for indirect impacts of an activity or entity. The carbon footprint of a city, for example, represents not only greenhouse gas emissions from within city boundaries but also those from production activities in regions and countries outside the city that are linked to city activities. Different scope definitions and calculation methods exist, but typically footprints refer to impacts related to the final consumption of goods and services in one place and are therefore said to constitute consumption-based accounts (CBA). Footprint indicators have been described for many environmental and several social indicatorsand have also recently been linked to the concept of a 'safe and just' development space. This framework combines the planetary boundaries (PB) concept, which maps out long-term sustainability thresholds for human-induced resource use and pollution based on Earth science principles, with social and economic foundations that align with the goals and targets of the SDGs. There is a substantial overlap between PBs and environmental SDGs. Defining what is environmentally safe and socially just, helps to operationalise the SDGs based on quantifiable benchmarks. Currently, no country in the world operates fully within this safe and just operating space (SJS).

### The intergenerational effects of war on the health of children [^115We4GY]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Factor in a longer-term perspective if contemplating going to war

The link between the likely longer-term health consequences of going to war and the conflict itself can be hard to establish definitively. The more time passes, the more possible confounders have to be taken into account, making direct causal links difficult to prove. However, combining disciplines and research to illustrate these links in the area of child health can be compelling, as there is a general consensus that children should be protected during war and that future generations are innocent. This makes a growing body of evidence that supports the link between conflict and future health problems for children a strong advocacy tool for conflict prevention.

Ensure a long-term component to interventions both during and after conflict, taking long term consequences into account

The type of interventions used to meet health needs caused by conflict, and the resources that are dedicated to them, should be decided on the basis of need. Much work has been done on how those needs can be accurately assessed and minimum standards of response assured. If need can be shown to be more long-lasting and serious than previously thought, particularly in relation to mother and child health, it could influence needs assessments, minimum standards and intervention planning. This would also help make the case for sufficient and appropriate resource allocation.

Ensure extra care is provided for vulnerable groups, particularly pregnant women

Evidence of the intergenerational health consequences of violent conflict will reinforce the degree of vulnerability of pregnant women to health shocks. Pregnant and lactating women are already recognized as a priority group for humanitarian health programs, but there is still much to be done before programs are fully integrated, effective and adequately resourced. A better understanding of the consequences of not having optimal and well-resourced programs will be a strong advocacy tool to use with donors and others.

Upholding international conventions to safeguard children through intergenerational justice

International law that relates to the rights of children is almost universally recognized and key parts of it are considered to be customary law. Better established links between violent conflict and the health and wellbeing of children not yet born could contribute to holding those who initiate war or violent conflict to account for the consequences of their actions. This, in turn, would be a further restraining factor on initiating violent conflict.

### Global threats to human water security and river biodiversity [^114RSvCf]. Nature (2010). Excellent credibility.

Protecting the world's freshwater resources requires diagnosing threats over a broad range of scales, from global to local. Here we present the first worldwide synthesis to jointly consider human and biodiversity perspectives on water security using a spatial framework that quantifies multiple stressors and accounts for downstream impacts. We find that nearly 80% of the world's population is exposed to high levels of threat to water security. Massive investment in water technology enables rich nations to offset high stressor levels without remedying their underlying causes, whereas less wealthy nations remain vulnerable. A similar lack of precautionary investment jeopardizes biodiversity, with habitats associated with 65% of continental discharge classified as moderately to highly threatened. The cumulative threat framework offers a tool for prioritizing policy and management responses to this crisis, and underscores the necessity of limiting threats at their source instead of through costly remediation of symptoms in order to assure global water security for both humans and freshwater biodiversity.

### Globally networked risks and how to respond [^112GnD62]. Nature (2013). Excellent credibility.

Today's strongly connected, global networks have produced highly interdependent systems that we do not understand and cannot control well. These systems are vulnerable to failure at all scales, posing serious threats to society, even when external shocks are absent. As the complexity and interaction strengths in our networked world increase, man-made systems can become unstable, creating uncontrollable situations even when decision-makers are well-skilled, have all data and technology at their disposal, and do their best. To make these systems manageable, a fundamental redesign is needed. A 'Global Systems Science' might create the required knowledge and paradigm shift in thinking.

### Implications of the precautionary principle in research and policy-making [^111s3rfY]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The Precautionary Principle (PP) has recently been formally introduced into national and international law. The key element is the justification for acting in the face of uncertainty. The PP is thereby a tool for avoiding possible future harm associated with suspected, but not conclusive, environmental risks. Under the PP, the burden of proof is shifted from demonstrating the presence of risk to demonstrating the absence of risk and it is the responsibility of the producer of a technology to demonstrate its safety rather than the responsibility of public authorities to show harm. Past experiences show the costly consequences of disregarding early warnings about environmental hazards. Today, the need for applying the PP is even greater. New research is needed to expand current insight into disease causation, to elucidate the full scope of potential adverse implications resulting from environmental pollutants, and to identify opportunities for prevention. Research approaches should be developed and strengthened to counteract innate ideological biases and to support our confidence in applying the PP for decision-making in the public policy arena.

### Call for emergency action to limit global temperature increases, restore biodiversity, and protect health [^117J2Hvk]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

These measures will also improve the social and economic determinants of health, the poor state of which may have made populations more vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic. But the changes cannot be achieved through a return to damaging austerity policies or the continuation of the large inequalities of wealth and power within and between countries.

In particular, countries that have disproportionately created the environmental crisis must do more to support low-income and middle-income countries to build cleaner, healthier, and more resilient societies. High-income countries must meet and go beyond their outstanding commitment to provide US$100 billion a year, making up for any shortfall in 2020 and increasing contributions to and beyond 2025. Funding must be equally split between mitigation and adaptation, including improving the resilience of health systems.

Financing should be through grants rather than loans, building local capabilities and truly empowering communities, and should come alongside forgiving large debts, which constrain the agency of so many low-income countries. Additional funding must be marshalled to compensate for inevitable loss and damage caused by the consequences of the environmental crisis.

As health professionals, we must do all we can to aid the transition to a sustainable, fairer, resilient, and healthier world. Alongside acting to reduce the harm from the environmental crisis, we should proactively contribute to global prevention of further damage and action on the root causes of the crisis. We must hold global leaders to account and continue to educate others about the health risks of the crisis. We must join in the work to achieve environmentally sustainable health systems before 2040, recognizing that this will mean changing clinical practice. Health institutions have already divested more than $42 billion of assets from fossil fuels; others should join them.

The greatest threat to global public health is the continued failure of world leaders to keep the global temperature rise below 1•5 °C and to restore nature. Urgent, society-wide changes must be made and will lead to a fairer and healthier world. We, as editors of health journals, call for governments and other leaders to act, marking 2021 as the year that the world finally changes course.

### Designing flows to resolve human and environmental water needs in a dam-regulated river [^116v3L8j]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

How multiple benefits from designer environmental flows are realized across different groups in society depends on the physical and social structures, as well as the political economy from which access and entitlements to these benefits are mediated. Successful environmental flow implementation requires diverse and authentic stakeholder involvement to define and refine desired social and biological outcomes. We have illustrated how particular flow designs may best promote native fish conservation after accounting for human water needs, but these decisions ultimately depend on the shifting values that stakeholders place on a whole suite of competing objectives. These values are also likely to morph in response to changes in water availability, human water needs, and natural resource management goals. Region-wide planning and consensus building remains essential to achieving multiple benefits from environmental flow management, and there is no denying that many water-resource decisions are made in contentious contexts constrained by political, legal, social, and economic realities.

Despite the oft-cited headlines of mounting conflicts between human and ecosystem needs for water, we predict that such trade-offs can be creatively navigated and potentially avoided by using multi-objective optimization. This approach allows for the discovery of efficient solutions that minimize conflict among competing water needs when trade-offs cannot be avoided. In human-altered rivers facing multiple stressors that include invasive species, mimicking natural flow regimes below dams may be just one of many options for conserving freshwater diversity. Designer flows have been suggested as a means to enable ecosystem design and support adaptation to environmental change, and here we provide a quantitative, albeit untested, illustration of how this emerging paradigm can be realized to ensure both societal and environmental benefits of dam operations. Further advancements in the development of multi-species functional flow–ecology models and the incorporation of environmental, social, and political stochasticity in flow design prescriptions will increase consensus on designer flows as the operating standard for human-altered rivers.

### Foresight approaches for future health shocks: integration into policy making and accompanying research priorities [^117F7Yr9]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Key messages

An articulated set of fundamental values and clearly defined objectives should underlie policy selection, particularly in emergency situations
Embedding systems thinking in the policy making process helps to support optimal decision making when faced with complex problems and inevitable trade-offs
Developing long term resilience can help to avoid crises and prepare for emergencies but requires continuous investment
Decision makers must be involved from the beginning to improve the probability that insights are both useful and translated into policy
Practising situational awareness means anticipating and being prepared to respond to context specific challenges associated with potential emergencies
A broad range of stakeholders and expertise should be included to ensure that foresight approaches capture the key drivers of potential adverse outcomes
An overarching open research question is how to accommodate emergency preparedness within the reality of politics as well as policy

Effective structured decision making for policy making relies on comprehensive analysis and strategic foresight that enables policy makers to prevent, mitigate, and respond to potential emergencies. Foresight approaches aim to explore and anticipate future situations. Foresight approaches to inform emergency prevention and response have been used in many different contexts from adaptation to extreme heat or rainfall to terrorism, foreign policy, and pandemics.

Foresight approaches include many methods, one of which is scenario planning, which offers a structured method for anticipating and preparing for future uncertainties. Scenario planning involves exploring a range of plausible futures, each with distinct challenges and opportunities. It can involve narrative exercises, real life exercises with personnel on the ground (for example, for antiterrorism), computer simulations (for example, of crowd movement or population behaviour in a pandemic), or probabilistic mathematical models of possible futures (for example, epidemics or climate change).

### A well-timed shift from local to global agreements accelerates climate change mitigation [^112fqrV6]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Recent attempts at cooperating on climate change mitigation highlight the limited efficacy of large-scale negotiations, when commitment to mitigation is costly and initially rare. Deepening existing voluntary mitigation pledges could require more stringent, legally-binding agreements that currently remain untenable at the global scale. Building-blocks approaches promise greater success by localizing agreements to regions or few-nation summits, but risk slowing mitigation adoption globally. Here, we show that a well-timed policy shift from local to global legally-binding agreements can dramatically accelerate mitigation compared to using only local, only global, or both agreement types simultaneously. This highlights the scale-specific roles of mitigation incentives: local agreements promote and sustain mitigation commitments in early-adopting groups, after which global agreements rapidly draw in late-adopting groups. We conclude that focusing negotiations on local legally-binding agreements and, as these become common, a renewed pursuit of stringent, legally-binding world-wide agreements could best overcome many current challenges facing climate mitigation.

The GWEPs of 15 of the 17 formerly endemic countries already certified as Guinea worm-free each had to address severe insecurity at some time in their work, including a civil war in Cote d'Ivoire and a large interethnic conflict in Ghana. South Sudan's GWEP has faced civil war, political conflict, and ethnic disputes since before it gained independence in 2011, while insecurity became a severe constraint for Mali's GWEP after a coup d'etat in 2012 rendered much of the country off-limits to outsiders. Health staff and village volunteers in GWEPs of both countries have persevered with courage and creativity, nonetheless, as shown by resilient measures of active surveillance. South Sudan has benefitted from very strong political support by the head of state, minister of health, other ministers, and other political leaders over the years. The SSGWEP's dramatic achievements despite its unusually complex epidemiology are an especially impressive demonstration of a program's ability to overcome serious security constraints. The widely dispersed Guinea worm infections in South Sudan with no traceable sources of infection by epidemiological investigation are cause for concern, despite effective containment of known cases and no known sustained animal infections. Adding routine genetic analysis of Guinea worms to ongoing active surveillance, case containment, and case investigation seems the best way forward in South Sudan as research in Chad has shown.

### SHEA position statement on pandemic preparedness for policymakers: introduction and overview [^111GYew2]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). High credibility.

SHEA position statement — background on pandemic preparedness describes how the COVID-19 pandemic exposed pre-existing problems within the US healthcare system, including lack of capacity to manage a large influx of contagious patients while maintaining routine and emergency care to non-COVID patients, a "just in time" supply network causing shortages and competition for essential supplies, and longstanding inequities in the distribution of healthcare and the healthcare workforce. It notes that a decades-long shift to global supply chains compounded gaps in preparedness for supplies such as personal protective equipment and ventilators, and that inequities in racial and socioeconomic outcomes accelerated the call to focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion. The text adds that the pandemic accelerated cooperation between government entities and the healthcare system with swift implementation of mitigation measures, new therapies and vaccinations despite a fragmented system and political divisions, yet misinformation and political divisions continue to prevent a strong and coordinated response. It concludes that rising microbial resistance, emerging or re-emerging pathogens, increasing globalization, an aging population, and climate change increase the likelihood of another pandemic.

### Foresight approaches for future health shocks: integration into policy making and accompanying research priorities [^116eE8mQ]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Given the many diverse views within the nation, consensus may not be possible. But in this case, the attempt to achieve consensus — whatever the method — serves as "an open discourse that enables interaction and communication… and leads to mutual understanding"and, hopefully, greater legitimacy in whatever decisions are ultimately made. Again, whatever the method, decision makers must be transparent as to which values underlie their policy and how they were chosen.

Once the values underlying policies have been articulated, these can be translated into objectives and policy options, and the different options can then be assessed using a range of methods. Values can be explicitly incorporated into cost-benefit analyses by using methods such as "social welfare functions", which aim to quantify overall benefit for a society. Techniques such as multicriteria decision analysis, preference ranking, or causal inference can help to prioritise preferences in the face of difficult trade-offs, on the basis of articulated values and objectives. This would also make the process of parliamentary scrutiny of emergency measures easier, more efficient, and more legitimate.

Future research efforts need to consider how to choose a set of values when consensus is not achieved, while retaining legitimacy; how to translate values into specific policy objectives; how best to incorporate the articulated values into decision methods for choosing between policy options; what frameworks work best to capture intended and unintended consequences of major policy initiatives; and how broad to go when considering costs and benefits (for example, whether to include the potential economic benefit of future new technology production and adoption in climate change adaptation). This is particularly important when costs and benefits are uncertain.

### Environmental issues in global pediatric health: policy statement [^113jj4s4]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Need for increased resources in children's environmental health — funding and capacity building requirements state that given the immense burden of disease attributable to modifiable environmental factors, increased financial support and capacity building in environmental public health and research is urgently needed in all countries, and especially low- and middle-income countries (LMICs); programs such as the WHO-National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) Collaborating Centers and the Fogarty International Center offer international training programs, research, capacity building, and information sharing across countries, which have reduced disease burden around the world; however, substantially more funding and investment in these types of programs is needed to fully address the complex and changing scope of environmentally related disease.

### Food security, climate change and mental health problems in a Colombian indigenous paediatric population [^113TRMq7]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

Limitations

While this study provides valuable insights into the interplay between climate change and mental health in an Indigenous community, several limitations must be acknowledged. First, although the displacement due to armed conflict provided a distinctive context for the study, disentangling its effects from those of subsequent experience of environmental degradation remains challenging. Second, the trauma associated with the loss of parental figures in 25% of households may independently contribute to adverse mental health outcomes, reflecting a polycrisis where multiple stressors intersect, complicating the attribution of outcomes solely to climate change. Finally, limitations such as language barriers and a relatively small sample size may restrict the generalisability of our findings to other Indigenous communities. Future research should involve deeper community engagement to capture more nuanced perspectives and enable meaningful comparisons across diverse Indigenous groups.

### The principles of natural climate solutions [^116zXE1U]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Outstanding challenges

While we have attempted to resolve some of the persistent confusion and controversy around NCS through the articulation of foundational and operational principles, many real issues remain where critiques and debates will be fruitful. First, much more work is needed to understand and address the feasibility constraints (inputs, markets, behaviors and attitudes, institutions, policies, and governance) that limit NCS action. Second, many ecosystem stewards view NCS benefits in the context of a broader set of benefits (for example, biodiversity, water, air, soil, human well-being, climate resilience); but more work is needed to quantify where and how NCS action can deliver these co-benefits, and where and how there are real trade-offs. Third, continuous effort is needed to ensure that NCS are indeed additional, especially to the extent that NCS activities contribute credits to carbon markets. Fourth, additionality is notoriously difficult to prove in areas with high carbon stocks and low historic rates of disturbance (such as high forest cover, low deforestation zones), despite real increasing future threats; the degree and timing of risk that these forests face needs to be better quantified to determine the relative additionality of ongoing actions to protect them. Fifth, additional research is needed to ensure that NCS mitigation remains durable to future disturbances, especially the droughts and wildfires that are expected to increase with climate change. Sixth, NCS science has, to date, largely focused on measuring NCS opportunity, but to be successful, we need consistent, compatible NCS monitoring systems to accurately quantify impacts and learn adaptively. Seventh, as we expand the scale of NCS action in an adaptive management cycle, we need a rapid global learning network to replicate successes and prevent repeating mistakes. Finally, the NCS community as a whole needs to demonstrate a commitment to equity by creatively and continuously seeking ways to recognize and integrate the leadership and, with their consent, the knowledge and experience of Indigenous Peoples and other NCS stewards.

Implement climate risk screening — adding environmental content to routine intake — states to incorporate climate-related factors into existing health screening to identify patients who may be vulnerable to climate impacts; screeners for health maintenance often include social determinants of health, and the Social-E adds environmental questions as part of patient history. The screener asks whether the respondent would like to discuss health concerns related to climate change, and when checked, climate questions populate the on-screen agenda in the electronic health record (EHR) for a well-child visit with high-priority concerns for the pediatrician to address.

### When optimization for governing human-environment tipping elements is neither sustainable nor safe [^112dNd1k]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Optimizing economic welfare in environmental governance has been criticized for delivering short-term gains at the expense of long-term environmental degradation. Different from economic optimization, the concepts of sustainability and the more recent safe operating space have been used to derive policies in environmental governance. However, a formal comparison between these three policy paradigms is still missing, leaving policy makers uncertain which paradigm to apply. Here, we develop a better understanding of their interrelationships, using a stylized model of human-environment tipping elements. We find that no paradigm guarantees fulfilling requirements imposed by another paradigm and derive simple heuristics for the conditions under which these trade-offs occur. We show that the absence of such a master paradigm is of special relevance for governing real-world tipping systems such as climate, fisheries, and farming, which may reside in a parameter regime where economic optimization is neither sustainable nor safe.

### Crisis + emergency risk communication. 2012 edition [^111t4osm]. CDC (2012). Medium credibility.

Stakeholder and partner communication — when issues are framed broadly, communicators are directed to "ask questions that are more specific to the audience" to surface concrete concerns and actions, using prompts such as "What are the ramifications to you (your family, your community, or the nation) when faced with this current problem?", "What consequences are you hoping to avoid?", "What do you see as the worst outcome for you (or your community)?", and "What courses of action do you believe could lead to this outcome?" The page adds that "Questions that encourage audience members to state the benefits they would like to see result from a course of action may promote understanding of anticipated outcomes", with examples including "Because you have brought up quarantine, what benefits would you (or your community) expect if you accepted quarantine as a course of action to reduce spread of disease?" and "From what I understand, you are looking for a way to protect yourself (or your family or community) from more illness or death. If I can explain how quarantine will meet those needs, are you open to implementing it?" It emphasizes the approach by noting, "Allowing people to persuade themselves is not an easy process" and that "It is the most effective way to gain your audience's acceptance in thought and behavior".

### Sharing the effort of the European green deal among countries [^1176WZjf]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

In this work, we present an approach that can contribute to a transparent decision process when partitioning an overall emissions target among subsidiary entities by aligning disparate views and defining an allocation space where different parties could agree to an equitable compromise. It builds upon the categorization of equity principles used in the effort-sharing literature –. For negotiation processes heavily influenced by a range of factors, such as historical path dependencies, side deals, power struggles, different cultures, or domestic politics, such transparency in terms of equity may be a significant factor contributing to success, given the increasing weight of the equity dimension in such negotiations. We assess the implications of the proposed approach — in terms of the resulting emissions budget allocation and corresponding reduction targets — in the context of the European Union (EU) negotiations in 2022 to raise the 2030 effort-sharing target. We first explore the implications of different effort-sharing mechanisms and interpretations of equity or justice on a singular, country level, finding that the resulting ranges of possible emissions reduction burden can vary widely. In such a case, if each country were to favor a different equity interpretation, the overall target of the EU in 2030 would most likely remain unmet. However, our proposed framework allows for systematically combining different interpretations of equity or justice on the basis of three major principles — capability, equality, and responsibility — and allows us to explore situations where country targets are the result of a weighted combination of interpretations of those principles, where member state reductions add up to the overall EU reduction target. In doing so we distinguish interpretations of equity or justice that reflect considerations of equality, capability and responsibility. By identifying weighted combinations of interpretations of these principles that minimize the changes in emission reduction effort required by countries compared to their (i) upper bounds of equity-compatible emissions or, given the practical importance of negotiation history, (ii) previous commitments in the earlier less ambitious effort-sharing agreement, we identify a possible space for decision-making which combines multiple equity interpretations. We find that the possible combinations of equity interpretations, and the strength at which they are applied, result in a wide range of space for decision-making which comprises a richer set of ethical considerations than the 2021 proposed EU approach. We conclude with a discussion of the described framework and its applicability in specific negotiation and policymaking processes, also in other international contexts.

### Gifting future scientists the past through well-preserved specimens of modern microbial ecosystems [^113e3KFr]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Our planet is facing formidable challenges that are exacerbated by climate change, including a rapid loss of biodiversity. Whether the great depletion that has afflicted plants and animals has also occurred among microbes is not yet clear, but numerous observations have revealed a reduction in microbial diversity that is linked to industrialized lifestyle at least for the human gut environment, which is also associated with a dramatic increase in human autoimmune disorders. Given these interlinked crises, it is understandable that all prominent microbial archiving efforts target microbes that are directly associated with human wellbeing, through isolates or fecal samples from the human gut, or microbial isolates from plants or fermented foods that are key to human food security. Similar to other efforts, the MVI pilot phase starts with a focus on human-associated microbes. But the MVI differs from previous efforts as a standalone, non-profit entity substantiated by a comprehensive feasibility study that considers technical, organizational, legal, ethical, and economical aspects of implementing a long-term strategy from sample collection to storage to access, and its promise to broaden archival efforts to environmental samples.

It remains uncertain whether we can counteract the ongoing loss of biodiversity by resuscitating extinct organisms, and whether such organisms could survive without continuous human intervention. Nevertheless, such attempts will always attract attention. Not only because 'bringing something back' offers a nostalgic allure, but also because it represents a profound exercise of power: the ability to decide what is to be summoned into existence and on what terms. In parallel, it is critical to recognize that our basic science, archival attempts, or efforts to resuscitate what is lost are unlikely to have lasting impact without transformative societal change that addresses the human drivers of biodiversity loss.

Luckily, we can pass such practical concerns to future generations, along with well-preserved samples that represent our time. In that quest, incorporating microbes in our historical archives is a fundamental responsibility as it is the only way to enable future scientists who will study ecological, environmental, and health priorities of their time with the latest technological advances to peer into the past. Scientists, policymakers, and funding agencies must support innovative, practical archival efforts to ensure future generations a robust, viable record of Earth's microbial heritage. Ideally, one that captures not only human-associated microbes but also those associated with other animals and plants, aquatic systems, soils, and sediments.

### A systemic risk assessment methodological framework for the global polycrisis [^111toZkD]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Borrowing in particular from the Decision Making under Deep Uncertainty framework, our framework also considers explicit acknowledgment of response trade-offs and vulnerabilities, to push systemic risk assessors to find responses that will last the course, rather than requiring hasty re-configuring in light of unexpected shocks.

Many existing frameworks acknowledge the importance of storylines and narratives. Our framework explicitly calls for consideration of how risks could evolve to crises, compound and cascade within and between systems, both with and without response measures; and further deepening of these storylines, through modelling and other analytical approaches (such as those outlined in Fig. 3). In addition, and in common with most existing systemic risk frameworks, our framework includes the critical process of monitoring, learning and adapting to changing circumstances.

Finally, our proposed methodological framework, as with many other frameworks, includes cross-cutting 'assessment practices', derived from a broader conception of overarching principles around systemic risk assessment and response, specifically designed to address this global polycrisis. These are clearly applicable to the food-energy crises examined earlier: ensuring participation of key stakeholders, including those most vulnerable to risks escalating into crises; centrality in assessment to non-human life and ecosystems, on which all social and economic activities depend (e.g. through providing food, fuel and fibre), as well as having intrinsic value in their own right; diversity in perspectives, to capture different factors and drivers of risks; diversity in data, evidence and methods, to ensure that the greatest number of these factors and drivers can be quantified and/or qualified; and active questioning and minimising of biases through stress-testing and red-teaming. Fit-for-purpose systemic risk assessment in the context of multi-faceted, ambiguous and fast-evolving interconnected risks must also actively communicate irreducible uncertainty, to ensure that assessment results are not seen as definitive or prescriptive where this is inappropriate. Finally, consideration of risk dynamics and responses will require detailed, transparent data, evidence and methods, capturing the value of both quantitative data sets and methods, as well as on-the-ground experience of people and communities facing risks and vulnerabilities. Organising this around a taxonomy of risks that measure elements of system architectures, long-term stresses, short-term triggers and resultant crises, as well as existing and potential responses, provides a logical method to catalogue and parse diverse risk-relevant data, evidence and methods (Supplementary Note 4).

### The principles of natural climate solutions [^115pVYcF]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Finally, significant confusion arises when untested NCS interventions are promoted widely without a robust scientific basis. However, recent publications have provided a mechanism for differentiating well-tested 'ready-to implement' NCS pathways from emerging or nascent pathways that require further research.

While confusion and controversy are to be expected in a rapidly growing field, without a clear framework for productive conversation and reliable action, there is a concern that momentum for NCS implementation will stall. Avoiding climate catastrophe requires immediate NCS action, but to be effective, NCS must be implemented equitably and sustainably. When initiatives claim to implement NCS but fail to achieve sustainable, equitable climate mitigation, they divert resources away from legitimate climate solutions and undermine public support for true NCS.

Many have commented on the risks of poorly-informed NCS action. but few have offered a clear path forward for real, fair and well-informed NCS action. If the NCS movement is to scale rapidly, the evolving NCS conversation needs normative criteria to help practitioners, policymakers, researchers, and the public evaluate whether NCS options are tangible, viable, and appropriate.

In this Perspective, we outline these normative criteria as a set of NCS principles (Box 1 and Fig. 2) that can be used to identify NCS actions worthy of support. These principles address problems that contribute to unproductive confusion and controversy around climate change mitigation. NCS foundational principles are criteria (nature-based, sustainable, climate-additional, measurable, and equitable) that provide a working definition of NCS based on the existing literature. This working definition enables more effective and productive NCS action by clarifying the boundaries of the NCS conversation. NCS operational principles guide NCS implementation by specifying how to apply NCS foundational principles to real-world action. These fifteen operational principles provide guidance to policymakers and practitioners so that risks can be navigated intelligently without impeding action. Taken together, the NCS principles orient NCS activities to the appropriate scope (Principle 1), ensure positive climate benefits (Principle 4) and avoid negative impacts (Principles 2, 4, and 5). While we hope the normative nature of these principles facilitates implementation by mitigating against confusion and controversy, we acknowledge that, as with all normative criteria, they are idealized, and the real-world complexities of conservation action will continue to expose new uncertainties that should allow the concept to evolve through active and adaptive action. Over time, it may be necessary to add or adjust principles.

### Harnessing occupational and environmental medicine expertise to transform medical care: a catalyst for mitigating the human health impacts of climate change [^113ffcma]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Impact of climate change on human health — leading health organizations have identified climate change as "the most significant health threat facing humanity in our time", with "present and future far-reaching impacts" on morbidity, mortality, health care systems, quality of life, environmental health, and economic productivity. In the United States, "in the summer of 2019, more than 150 medical organizations" declared a "health emergency". Despite progress since the "2015 Paris Agreement", the document states that "restricting global warming to 1.5°C or less is no longer achievable with existing national pledges", and that "the hottest year on record was 2024, with the global average temperature increase reaching an average 1.55°C". The latest United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report indicates the time window to achieve "the agreement's aspirational goal or even the more modest goal of 2°C" may be "as little as a few years". A combination of natural and anthropogenic forcing alters temperature, precipitation, and weather patterns, producing exposures — "rising temperatures, precipitation extremes, extreme weather events, and rising sea levels" — that "can lead to multiple adverse health outcomes", including temperature-related illnesses; food, water, and vector-borne diseases; air pollution-related conditions; mental health problems; injuries; malnutrition; and interpersonal violence.

### Responding to the global human resources crisis [^111X4hyz]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

The global community is in the midst of a growing response to health crises in developing countries, which is focused on mobilising financial resources and increasing access to essential medicines. However, the response has yet to tackle the most important aspect of health-care systems — the people that make them work. Human resources for health — the personnel that deliver public-health, clinical, and environmental services — are in disarray and decline in much of the developing world, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. The reasons behind this disorder are complex. For decades, efforts have focused on building training institutions. What is becoming increasingly clear, however, is that issues of supply, demand, and mobility (transnational, regional, and local) are central to the human-resource problem. Without substantial improvements in workforces, newly mobilised funds and commodities will not deliver on their promise. The global community needs to engage in four core strategies: raise the profile of the issue of human resources; improve the conceptual base and statistical evidence available to decision makers; collect, share, and learn from country experiences; and begin to formulate and enact policies at the country level that affect all aspects of the crisis.

### Quantifying the dynamics of failure across science, startups and security [^113jKktv]. Nature (2019). Excellent credibility.

Human achievements are often preceded by repeated attempts that fail, but little is known about the mechanisms that govern the dynamics of failure. Here, building on previous research relating to innovation 1–7, human dynamics 8–11 and learning 12–17, we develop a simple one-parameter model that mimics how successful future attempts build on past efforts. Solving this model analytically suggests that a phase transition separates the dynamics of failure into regions of progression or stagnation and predicts that, near the critical threshold, agents who share similar characteristics and learning strategies may experience fundamentally different outcomes following failures. Above the critical point, agents exploit incremental refinements to systematically advance towards success, whereas below it, they explore disjoint opportunities without a pattern of improvement. The model makes several empirically testable predictions, demonstrating that those who eventually succeed and those who do not may initially appear similar, but can be characterized by fundamentally distinct failure dynamics in terms of the efficiency and quality associated with each subsequent attempt. We collected large-scale data from three disparate domains and traced repeated attempts by investigators to obtain National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants to fund their research, innovators to successfully exit their startup ventures, and terrorist organizations to claim casualties in violent attacks. We find broadly consistent empirical support across all three domains, which systematically verifies each prediction of our model. Together, our findings unveil detectable yet previously unknown early signals that enable us to identify failure dynamics that will lead to ultimate success or failure. Given the ubiquitous nature of failure and the paucity of quantitative approaches to understand it, these results represent an initial step towards the deeper understanding of the complex dynamics underlying failure.

### Key determinants of global land-use projections [^113a1vND]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Land use is at the core of various sustainable development goals. Long-term climate foresight studies have structured their recent analyses around five socio-economic pathways (SSPs), with consistent storylines of future macroeconomic and societal developments; however, model quantification of these scenarios shows substantial heterogeneity in land-use projections. Here we build on a recently developed sensitivity approach to identify how future land use depends on six distinct socio-economic drivers (population, wealth, consumption preferences, agricultural productivity, land-use regulation, and trade) and their interactions. Spread across models arises mostly from diverging sensitivities to long-term drivers and from various representations of land-use regulation and trade, calling for reconciliation efforts and more empirical research. Most influential determinants for future cropland and pasture extent are population and agricultural efficiency. Furthermore, land-use regulation and consumption changes can play a key role in reducing both land use and food-security risks, and need to be central elements in sustainable development strategies.

### A human rights approach: the right to education in the time of COVID-19: commentary on COVID-19 special section [^112HKo6V]. Child Development (2021). Medium credibility.

The third key element concerns the nature of States' duties. Although the full realization of the right to education might not be possible immediately, States have a "specific and continuing obligation to move as expeditiously as possible towards the full realization" of the right (Committee on economic social and cultural rights). Importantly, non‐discrimination is an immediate duty, which cannot be delayed. The closure of schools during the COVID‐19 pandemic magnified States' obligations to provide access to schools. However, States' obligations extend beyond access. States are also required to ensure the provision of functioning educational institutions with sanitation, safe drinking water, trained teachers, IT, and computer facilities. Schools must also be accessible, physically, and economically; acceptable in form and substance; and adaptable to changing needs (Committee on economic social and cultural rights). Ultimately, States must ensure education is directed to the overriding aims expressed in the Covenants, which include both the development of the child's personality and abilities to their fullest potential, and their preparation to participate effectively in society "in the spirit of understanding, peace, tolerance, equality of sexes, and friendship among all peoples… " (CRC, Art. 13; CRPD, Art 24; ICESCR, Art. 29(1)(a) and (d)). Online teaching only very partially achieves these objectives, and then only for a minority of learners. The use of digital tools, while bringing important benefits, also needs to be managed in a human‐rights compliant way. In particular, children's right to privacy requires States to protect their education data, especially in relation to the collection, retention, or sharing of such data (Special Rapporteur on the Right to Education,), for commercial, immigration, or security purposes.

For our youngest generations, the loss of education during the pandemic has been a heavy burden, and its consequences will linger in years to come. Moreover, the pandemic exposed the deep underlying inequalities and weaknesses in the system, as well as triggering further potential human rights breaches. The promise of "building back better" once we emerge from this pandemic should have the right to education as a central pillar. This is not just a good policy choice for both individuals and societies. It is a binding obligation in international human rights law.

### Public perceptions on carbon removal from focus groups in 22 countries [^112PXM8f]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Carbon removal is emerging as a pillar of governmental and industry commitments toward achieving Net Zero targets. Drawing from 44 focus groups in 22 countries, we map technical and societal issues that a representative sample of publics raise on five major types of carbon removal (forests, soils, direct air capture, enhanced weathering, and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage), and how these translate to preferences for governance actors, mechanisms, and rationales. We assess gaps and overlaps between a global range of public perceptions and how carbon removal is currently emerging in assessment, innovation, and decision-making. In conclusion, we outline key societal expectations for informing assessment and policy: prioritize public engagement as more than acceptance research; scrutiny and regulation of industry beyond incentivizing innovation; systemic coordination across sectors, levels, and borders; and prioritize underlying causes of climate change and interrelated governance issues.
