## Question

Infected dermal cyst treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to manage infected dermal (epidermoid) cysts. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the lesion type and pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the primary treatment and when antibiotics are indicated. Next, I will review culture strategy, wound care, and recurrence prevention. After that, I need to consider special anatomic sites and immunocompromised hosts. Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and highlight pitfalls and exceptions, making sure each assertion aligns with guideline strength and evidence quality.

> Let me first confirm the lesion we are treating: most "dermal cysts" in this context are epidermoid (epidermal inclusion) cysts, which are lined by squamous epithelium and contain keratin. When inflamed, they can mimic infection, but true infection is not universal, so I should be cautious not to overcall cellulitis when the process is primarily inflammatory rather than purulent abscess [^113BZEL5] [^111nVx8a].

> Wait, let me verify the primary therapy before discussing antibiotics. The IDSA SSTI guideline gives a strong recommendation for incision and drainage (I&D) as first-line treatment for inflamed epidermoid cysts, and it explicitly advises against aspiration because of low success and high recurrence, so I&D with evacuation of contents and probing for loculations is the standard of care [^111zKqSD] [^113UkXua] [^114AQV9v].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antibiotics. I need to check when they are actually indicated. Routine antibiotics do not improve cure after I&D in typical cases, including MRSA, so antibiotics should be reserved for patients with systemic inflammatory response (SIRS), markedly impaired host defenses, extremes of age, multiple abscesses, or failure to improve after adequate drainage. If used, a 5–10 day course active against S. aureus (including MRSA when risk factors are present) is reasonable, and some data suggest extending to 7–10 days if response is suboptimal at 5 days, though the IDSA strength is weak/low for many adjunctive scenarios [^113UkXua] [^111eVYNk] [^116cyEFX] [^117BeCBh].

> I should double-check the culture question because practice varies. The IDSA guideline recommends Gram stain and culture for carbuncles and abscesses but explicitly does not recommend routine Gram stain and culture for inflamed epidermoid cysts; however, if the patient has recurrent abscesses or atypical features, obtaining cultures can guide therapy and support antimicrobial stewardship, so I will individualize this rather than reflexively culturing every inflamed cyst [^111zKqSD] [^117F1y5N] [^116CGGQm].

> Next, I should review wound care after I&D. Let me verify the evidence on packing versus simple dressings. The IDSA notes that simply covering the site with a dry dressing is usually easiest and effective, and a small study found packing caused more pain without improving healing, so I will favor a dry sterile gauze dressing with instructions for warm compresses and local hygiene rather than routine packing unless there is a specific indication [^113UkXua].

> I will now examine recurrence prevention and technique nuances. Simple I&D without removal of the cyst wall has a notable recurrence risk, so once inflammation subsides, complete excision of the cyst wall reduces recurrence; minimally invasive techniques can be considered in cosmetic areas, but I need to ensure complete wall removal to avoid persistence, and I should remember that prior infection or prior I&D thickens the cyst wall, which can make enucleation more challenging and increases the risk of incomplete excision if I am not meticulous [^113BZEL5] [^117Fgutx].

> But wait, what if the cyst is in a special anatomic location or the patient is immunocompromised? For facial lesions near critical structures, I should balance adequate drainage with cosmesis and consider early follow-up; for immunocompromised hosts, I should have a lower threshold for antibiotics and closer observation because systemic spread is more likely; for recurrent abscesses, I need to search for local drivers such as pilonidal disease, hidradenitis, or foreign material and consider decolonization strategies and evaluation for immune disorders if disease began in childhood [^116cyEFX] [^113UkXua] [^116CGGQm] [^1146M1nq].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought aspiration might be reasonable in select cases to avoid scarring. Hold on, I should verify that against the guideline. The IDSA explicitly discourages aspiration due to low success and high recurrence, so I will correct that inclination and adhere to I&D as the standard, reserving aspiration only for diagnostic purposes in exceptional scenarios rather than as therapy [^113UkXua] [^111zKqSD].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm while keeping the strength of recommendations in mind. First, confirm the diagnosis clinically and distinguish inflamed from purulent disease. Second, perform I&D with evacuation and probing, and avoid routine packing in favor of a dry dressing. Third, assess for SIRS, host defenses, extremes of age, multiple lesions, or treatment failure to decide on antibiotics. Fourth, if antibiotics are used, choose an agent active against S. aureus (include MRSA coverage when risk factors exist) for 5–10 days, extending toward 7–10 days if response is slow. Fifth, arrange follow-up in 1–2 weeks to ensure resolution and plan elective complete excision of the cyst wall once inflammation settles to prevent recurrence [^111zKqSD] [^113UkXua] [^116cyEFX] [^117BeCBh].

> I should confirm key pitfalls and exceptions so I do not overgeneralize. Do not substitute aspiration for I&D, do not prescribe antibiotics reflexively without systemic features or failure of drainage, and do not forget to address recurrence drivers in patients with multiple episodes. Conversely, do not delay drainage when fluctuance is present, and do not overlook immunocompromised hosts who merit broader coverage and closer follow-up even when the presentation seems "simple" [^113UkXua] [^116CGGQm] [^116cyEFX].

---

Infected dermal cysts are best managed with **incision and drainage** [^114AQV9v] as the primary therapy, with **antibiotics reserved for specific indications** [^113UkXua] such as systemic symptoms, immunocompromise, or failure of local therapy. Routine cultures are not needed for simple cases [^111zKqSD], but should be obtained in recurrent or atypical infections [^116CGGQm]. Complete excision of the cyst wall is essential to prevent recurrence [^113BZEL5], and patient education on hygiene and follow-up is important to reduce reinfection risk [^116CGGQm].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Infected dermal cysts typically present with the following **clinical features**:

- **Erythema**: Localized redness of the overlying skin.
- **Swelling**: Induration and fluctuance indicating abscess formation.
- **Pain**: Tenderness upon palpation.
- **Purulent discharge**: Yellowish-white material may extrude from a punctum or sinus tract.
- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, malaise, or lymphadenopathy may occur in severe cases.

Diagnosis is primarily **clinical**, based on physical examination findings. Imaging studies such as ultrasound or MRI may be considered for deep or recurrent cysts to assess extent and involvement of adjacent structures [^notfound].

---

## Indications for treatment

Treatment is indicated when any of the following are present: **clinical infection** — erythema, swelling, pain, or purulent discharge; **systemic symptoms** — fever, malaise, or lymphadenopathy; or **recurrence** — repeated infections or failure of conservative management [^113UkXua].

---

## Treatment options

### Incision and drainage (I&D)

Incision and drainage is the **primary treatment** for infected dermal cysts [^114AQV9v]. Key steps include:

- **Anesthesia**: Local anesthesia with lidocaine and epinephrine.
- **Incision**: Linear incision over the fluctuant area, parallel to Langer's lines when possible.
- **Evacuation**: Gentle expression of purulent material and keratinous debris.
- **Exploration**: Probe the cavity to break loculations and ensure complete drainage.
- **Irrigation**: Saline or antiseptic solution irrigation.
- **Wound care**: Leave the wound open or loosely pack with gauze; avoid tight packing to minimize pain and discomfort [^113UkXua].

---

### Antibiotic therapy

Antibiotics are **not routinely required** after I&D for uncomplicated abscesses, including MRSA [^113UkXua]. Indications for antibiotic therapy include:

- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, malaise, or lymphadenopathy.
- **Immunocompromise**: Diabetes, HIV, immunosuppressive therapy.
- **Failure of local therapy**: Persistent infection despite adequate I&D.
- **High-risk locations**: Face, hands, or genitalia [^116cyEFX].

Recommended **antibiotic regimens** include:

| **Antibiotic** | **Indication** | **Dosage** |
|-|-|-|
| Clindamycin | MRSA coverage | 300–450 mg PO TID |
| Doxycycline | MRSA coverage | 100 mg PO BID |
| Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole | MRSA coverage | 1–2 DS tablets PO BID |
| Amoxicillin-clavulanate | MSSA coverage | 875/125 mg PO BID |

---

Duration is typically **5–10 days**, tailored to clinical response [^116cyEFX].

---

### Surgical excision of cyst wall

Complete excision of the cyst wall is essential to prevent recurrence [^113BZEL5]. This can be performed at the time of I&D or delayed until inflammation subsides. Techniques include **minimal excision** — a small incision with expression and extraction of the cyst wall — and **electrosurgical methods** — electrosurgical removal for cosmetic outcomes [^1157DMqp].

---

## Adjunctive therapies

Adjunctive therapies include **topical antiseptics** — such as chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine — for local wound care and **analgesics** — acetaminophen or NSAIDs — for pain control.

---

## Potential complications

Untreated or inadequately managed infected dermal cysts may lead to:

- **Recurrence**: Common if cyst wall is not completely excised [^113BZEL5].
- **Scarring**: Particularly with repeated infections or inadequate drainage.
- **Chronic infection**: Persistent drainage and fibrosis.
- **Rare complications**: Spinal abscess or meningitis in spinal dermal sinus tracts [^116tvP83].

---

## Prevention strategies

Preventive measures include **hygiene** — regular cleansing of the affected area and avoidance of trauma or friction — and **patient education** on recognizing early signs of infection and the importance of prompt medical attention. For recurrent infections, consider **decolonization** with intranasal mupirocin and chlorhexidine washes [^116CGGQm].

---

## Follow-up care

Follow-up should include **clinical monitoring** within 1–2 weeks to assess healing and detect recurrence and **patient education** on signs of recurrence and when to seek medical attention.

---

## Special considerations

Special considerations include **immunocompromised patients**, who may require prolonged antibiotic therapy and closer follow-up, and **pediatric patients**, in whom conservative management with careful follow-up is often preferred [^117BAcXN].

---

Infected dermal cysts are best managed with **incision and drainage** [^114AQV9v], reserving antibiotics for specific indications [^113UkXua]. Complete excision of the cyst wall is essential to prevent recurrence [^113BZEL5], and patient education on hygiene and follow-up is important to reduce reinfection risk [^116CGGQm].

Corticosteroids are critical in the setting of intracranial hypertension to stabilize the patient. Doses are not well standardized, but may include dexamethasone, 0.2 mg/kg/day. Untreated hydrocephalus is a contraindication to antiparasitic therapy. Hydrocephalus usually requires shunt placement or cyst removal.

Endpoints for therapy have not been established. The MRI should be followed and examined for regression of the cystic lesions and improvement of enhancement. Enhancement may not completely disappear and the subarachnoid space may remain distorted, presumably because of scarring, presenting a challenge for the clinician deciding on a course of therapy. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis may be helpful if lumbar puncture can be performed safely. Cellularity and hypoglycorrhachia should normalize, but in patients with shunts, the protein may remain elevated. Antigen detection of the secreted metacestode antigens using a monoclonal antibody-based test is a useful adjunctive tool for following SAN patients undergoing treatment. Whereas antigen detection assays are presently commercially available in Europe, standardized assays are not commercially available in the United States. Normalization of CSF cellularity and glucose, absence of cystic lesions on MRI, and negative antigen assays should be an endpoint for ending therapy. Long-term follow-up is required. Subarachnoid NCC is a slowly developing infection and successful therapy may require years of treatment.

XXIII. What is the role of neurosurgery in SAN?

Recommendation.

42 We recommend that patients with hydrocephalus from SAN be treated with shunt surgery in addition to medical therapy (strong, low).
43 We suggest that some patients may benefit from surgical debulking over shunt surgery alone (weak, low).

Evidence summary.

Theoretically, surgical removal of parasite mass would be expected to shorten the course of treatment and decrease provoked inflammation. However, because there is a risk of surgery and bleeding due to adherent cysts, the role for debulking in SAN is controversial. Several groups have described endoscopic removal of cysts from SAN via a third ventriculostomy. When successful, this approach may lead to faster resolution of the cysticerci and decreased antigen-stimulated inflammation. However, this approach is not always possible and attempts to remove adherent cysts in the basilar cisterns can be catastrophic.

What is the treatment of infected meshes?

Respect prevention strategies to avoid surgical site infection and prosthetic contamination (recommendation 1A).

We suggest avoidance of mesh contamination following incisional SSI by an early and adequate local source control as well as antibiotic treatment (recommendation 1C).

In chronic sinuses and infected meshes, we suggest a complete surgical removal of the mesh which remains the only way to eradicate infection (recommendation 1C).

No clear recommendations on the benefit of biologic versus synthetic mesh in potentially contaminated fields can be proposed (recommendations 1C).

Hernia repair is one of the most common surgical procedures performed globally. Mesh infection, although infrequent, is a devastating complication of mesh hernioplasties, and for this reason, a prevention strategy is essential. Currently, several types of prosthetic mesh are widely used for repairing abdominal wall defects; however, there is no single universal ideal mesh. Synthetic meshes are easy to handle and well tolerated; however, they can be potentially associated with infection when bacteria adhere to the synthetic material leading to chronic infection. Mesh infection is a challenging complication of abdominal wall defect repairs.

Several benign, premalignant, and malignant lesions may arise on the vulva, and multiple types of procedures may be used to diagnose and treat these conditions. Punch and shave biopsies may be used to diagnose most vulvar conditions, but lesions suspected of being melanomas may best be diagnosed with narrow-margin excisional biopsies. Bartholin gland cysts and abscesses may be treated with several different treatment modalities, the most common of which are fistulization and marsupialization. Genital warts may be treated with several medical and surgical modalities to relieve symptoms.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^1139xXQm]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The management of mesh-site infections is challenging and always requires an individualized approach combining medical and surgical approaches. Clinical trials have demonstrated that in certain instances, non-operative strategies with conservative (non-surgical) management have been successful for salvaging a mesh. If conservative treatment fails, complete surgical removal of the mesh is suggested to reduce the risk of infection recurrence or severe complications, such as visceral adhesions and fistulae. A conservative surgical approach including abscess drainage, sinus excision, or partial mesh excision can fail and may result in recurrent mesh infections.

After removing the infected mesh, the intra-operative options are (a) no implant of a new mesh, (b) re-implantation of a new synthetic light-weight, macroporous mesh, and (c) replacement of the infected synthetic by a biological mesh. A critical issue in the repair of contaminated abdominal wall defects is the dilemma of choosing between synthetic material, with its presumed risk of surgical site complications, and biologic material, a costly alternative with questionable durability. In 2016, Atema et al. published a systematic review and meta-analysis of the repair of potentially contaminated and contaminated abdominal wall defects. Thirty-two studies published between January 1990 and June 2015 on repair of (potentially) contaminated hernias with ≥ 25 patients were reviewed. Fifteen studies solely described hernia repair with biologic mesh, 6 non-absorbable synthetic meshes, and 11 described various techniques. Studies reporting direct and prospective comparison of synthetic versus biological mesh in a cohort were not found. Surgical site complications and hernia recurrence rates were evaluated per degree of contamination and mesh type by calculating pooled proportions. In potentially contaminated hernias (CDC wound class 2), no benefit of biologic over synthetic mesh was found with comparable surgical site complication rates and a hernia recurrence rate of 9% for biologic and 9% for synthetic repair. In contaminated hernias (CDC wound class 3 and 4), most reports were on biologic mesh repair, showing high rates of surgical site complications and a hernia recurrence rate of 30%. Recurrence rates in contaminated hernias depended on whether primary fascial closure was achieved, or the repair with biologic mesh was bridging. Biologic mesh sublay repair with primary fascial closure showed lower recurrence rates than bridging repairs. Non-cross-linked biologic mesh can be used in contaminated hernia without mesh infection and subsequent need for mesh explantation. As only one study on synthetic repair of contaminated hernias was available in literature, no recommendation can be given on the use of synthetic mesh in this setting.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1146M1nq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Recurrent skin abscesses — A recurrent abscess at a site of previous infection should prompt a search for local causes such as a pilonidal cyst, hidradenitis suppurativa, or foreign material (strong, moderate). Recurrent abscesses should be drained and cultured early in the course of infection (strong, moderate). After obtaining cultures of recurrent abscess, treat with a 5- to 10-day course of an antibiotic active against the pathogen isolated (weak, low). Consider a 5-day decolonization regimen twice daily of intranasal mupirocin, daily chlorhexidine washes, and daily decontamination of personal items such as towels, sheets, and clothes for recurrent S. aureus infection (weak, low). Adult patients should be evaluated for neutrophil disorders if recurrent abscesses began in early childhood (strong, moderate).

### Bicyclic azetidines target acute and chronic stages of toxoplasma gondii by inhibiting parasite phenylalanyl t-RNA synthetase [^113fTxy6]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

To further understand the potential of BRD7929 as a therapeutic for the treatment for chronic toxoplasmosis, we tested whether treatment could prevent reactivation of latent infection using the Ifngr1 −/− mouse model of chronic infection (Fig. 6d). We infected Ifngr1 −/− mice with tissue cysts by oral gavage (type II, ME49-FLuc) and treated with sulfadiazine for 20 days starting 2 days post-infection to allow for the establishment of chronic infection and prevent death by acute infection. Because sulfadiazine has no activity against tissue cysts, discontinuation of treatment results in reactivation of chronic infection and re-emergence of tachyzoite proliferation leading to death in 7–10 days. Following removal of sulfadiazine (2 days), animals were treated QD by oral gavage for 16 days with BRD7929 (10 mg/kg) or vehicle control (Fig. 6d). Without sulfadiazine, control mice rapidly succumbed to recrudescent infection, whereas animals receiving BRD7929 had a delayed onset of death, including 1 of 6 animals who survived > 20 days post-treatment window (Fig. 6e). This sole surviving animal was seropositive (Fig. S5a), and subsequent bioassay of brain homogenate into a naive recipient Ifngr1 −/− mouse failed to detect any residual infection. Collectively, these findings indicate that this surviving animal was cured of chronic infection by treatment with BRD7929.

### Management of urachal anomalies in children: insights from a retrospective cohort study [^117BAcXN]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Historically, surgical excision has been part of the standard protocol for management of UA due to the concern for infection and the rare chance of urachal malignancies later in life. However, urachal cancers are very rare, and no evidence exists demonstrating that UAs in pediatric patients increase the likelihood of future malignancy (Arora et al.). Gleason et al. reported that 5721 UAs would need to be excised in order to prevent a single case of urachal adenocarcinoma out of 65 000 patients studied. Surgical excision of UA solely as a preventative measure against later malignancy appears to have minimal support in literature. Thus, non-operative management of symptomatic patients has become the preferred reasonable alternative to surgical treatment in contemporary practice. One study reported that 44 (56.4%) symptomatic patients had resolution of symptoms under observation. Another reported successful resolution of symptoms in 9 out of the 13 total patients. A study by Lipskar et al. even found three patients who had infected cysts recovered successfully with non-operative management of abscess drainage and treatment with antibiotics. When surgery becomes required, recommendations vary as to the ideal age for intervention, ranging from 6 months to 1 years.

However, that does not address the risk of future infections in asymptomatic patients. A study by Ueno et al. was one of the first to recommend non-invasive management for both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Zieger et al. posited that likely spontaneous involution of the UA during the first 6 months of life is common, so serial monitoring of UA in infants instead of excision is preferred in infancy. Naiditch et al. recommended non-operative management for asymptomatic UA without developing complications in the face of postoperative complication rate of 15% in 34 of their surgically treated patients, reported lower elsewhere in the literature. One study, while advocating for conservative treatment for asymptomatic UA, also recommends that patients with large cysts who do not achieve clinical or radiological resolution should undergo laparoscopic excision.

In recent years, clinicians have sought to formulate an algorithmic approach to managing UAs. Lipskar et al. suggested such an algorithm predicated on symptom presentation, type of UA, and whether UA resolution was achieved after conservative treatment. Gelikman et al. conducted a meta-analysis to investigate which predictive factors determine the need for surgical management. The analysis failed to identify any predictive factors to guide management of UA in pediatric patients.

### Association of recurrence of infected congenital preauricular cysts following incision and drainage vs fine-needle aspiration or antibiotic treatment: a retrospective review of treatment options [^114BEhYy]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Treatment modalities for preauricular sinus tract infections vary. Effort should be taken to decrease methods that lead to increased recurrence after surgical excision.

Objective

To determine whether incision and drainage (I & D) of infected congenital preauricular cysts is associated with increased rate of recurrence when compared with fine-needle aspiration or antibiotic treatment.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a 9-year (2006–2014) retrospective cohort study undertaken at a tertiary care pediatric hospital. Children treated for preauricular sinus tract infections were identified using the procedure code for excision of preauricular pit, cyst, or sinus tract.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Postexcision recurrence.

Results

Sixty-nine children ranging in age from 4 months to 17 years (mean age, 5.9 years) underwent excision of a preauricular cyst. Thirty-seven of 69 patients (54%) were female. Fifty-seven of 69 (83%) had a preoperative history of infection; the remainder had chronic drainage. Of children with preoperative infection, 27 were initially treated with incision and drainage (I & D), 12 were treated with fine-needle aspiration only, and 18 received antibiotic therapy alone. Overall, the recurrence rate was 8 in 69 (11.6%). Among the 27 patients with a preoperative history of infection treated with I & D, 5 lesions (18.5%) recurred, and among those who only received preoperative antibiotic therapy or fine-needle aspiration 1 in 30 lesions (3.3%) recurred (absolute difference of 15.2%; 95% CI, -1.7% to 33.6%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among infants and children undergoing excision of preauricular cysts, a history of infection was not associated with a higher recurrence rate. There was, however, evidence to suggest that a higher rate of recurrence exists among children who had a preoperative history of infection treated with I & D. Our results suggest a more conservative treatment of infected preauricular pit and/or sinus.

### A case of non-involuting congenital haemangioma with multiple epidermal cysts [^1143juE7]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

While infantile haemangiomas are the most common tumours of childhood, rare congenital haemangiomas grow to maximum size at birth and then spontaneously and rapidly regress (rapidly involuting congenital haemangiomas). However, certain congenital haemangiomas, described recently as 'non-involuting congenital haemangiomas', evolve differently and do not regress. There are several options regarding the treatment of infantile haemangiomas, but few reports have addressed the treatments of non-involuting congenital haemangiomas, though a small number have recommended surgical excision. However, the treatments of non-involuting congenital haemangiomas with multiple epidermal cysts have not been investigated. Epidermal cysts can cause recurrent infection, and we suspect that recurrent ulceration might cause the implantation of epidermal cells into the dermis, and result in the development of multiple epidermal cysts. Currently, epidermal cysts are treated by surgical excision, which should reduce complication rates. Herein, we report our experience of treating repeatedly infected non-involuting congenital haemangioma with multiple epidermal cysts.

### Treatment of soft tissue filler complications: expert consensus recommendations [^115wHzWj]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Infection

Delayed-onset chronic infections, which generally develop 2 or more weeks after injection, tend to affect a more generalized area and may involve an atypical organism (such as Mycobacteria or Escherichia coli). These are challenging for both diagnosis and treatment and can cause a chronic inflammatory response.

In the opinion of the panel, a sequence of treatment options similar to that in early acute infection should be followed:
To perform a bacterial culture and clinical assessment to decide type of infection and treat with antibiotics or corticosteroids.
It is important to do a differential diagnosis with hypersensitivity, as the use of steroids should be avoided in infection.
There are not comparative studies supporting the effectiveness of a specific therapeutic regimen. Once the species is identified, an antibiogram is required. If atypical mycobacteria are suspected, while waiting for the antibiogram results, an empirical treatment with antibiotics, which cover atypical mycobacteria, such as claritromicina 500 mg/twice daily combined with ethambutol or rifampicin, may be recommended.

Abscess

Abscess formation is a rare complication, reported in permanent hydrogel fillers, occurring any time from 1 week to several years after treatment; it may persist for weeks, and periodically recur for months.

The first-line therapy is drainage and antibiotics. As mentioned for the delayed-onset chronic infections, the panel recommends, in order to tailor the treatment, to obtain bacterial cultures and perform sensitivity reports. Although it is extremely rare, midfacial and periorbital infection may result in intracerebral complications.

It has been proposed that low-grade infections are responsible for all delayed-onset complications, including foreign-body granulomas, as a result of biofilm formation.

Nodules

Nodules and lumps are common complications resulting from the use of dermal fillers.

Nodules must be categorized as inflammatory or non-inflammatory.

### Low-dose naltrexone as treatment for epidermolysis bullosa pruriginosa-associated refractory pruritus [^114s3BbR]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Severe pruritus is the primary cause of morbidity and often the most distressing symptom of EBP. Histologic evaluation often reveals hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, a subepidermal blister or cleft, dermal fibrosis, and an associated vascular proliferation, which may be accompanied by a mild dermal chronic inflammatory infiltrate and milia cysts. Direct immunofluorescence is typically negative. Few treatments have proven effective at managing symptoms associated with EBP.

Dupilumab, a fully humanized monoclonal antibody, targets the interleukin 4 receptor alpha found on interleukin 4 and interleukin 13. Interestingly, elevated IgE levels have been reported in patients with EBP without a history of atopy. Recent reports have documented improvement of pruritus on dupilumab in patients with EBP who subsequently experienced a reduction in prurigo-like nodules and plaque formation. Unfortunately, our patient continued to have pruritus while taking dupilumab and was unable to tolerate this secondary to recurrent ocular and upper respiratory tract infection side effects. Oral JAK inhibitors, through inhibition of skin sensory neurons by interleukin 31, tumor necrosis factor- α, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin, are promising as a therapeutic option for pruritus, including in cases of EBP. Our patient was wary of the potential JAK inhibitor side effect profile; therefore, this treatment was not pursued.

### Rare report of unilateral postauricular dermoid cyst [^114nMfwt]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Dermoid cysts are benign developmental anomalies that occurred as a result of the sequestration of the skin along the lines of embryonic closure. Those occurring in the cervicofacial region are uncommon, accounting for about 7% of all dermoids and its presence in postauricular region is further exceptionally rare. A healthy 19-year-old Asian boy presented with a unilateral postauricular cyst that had been present since childhood without any symptom. The computed tomography scan revealed an encapsulated tumor with no intracranial extension. Histological examination of a biopsy taken from the lesion revealed a unilocular cyst found in the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Multinuclear giant cells and fragments of hair shaft are infiltrated in the cystic wall. Some keratin materials are seen in the intracystic area. However, the lining cells are not found. These histologic findings were suggested of the dermoid cyst. Patients with postauricular dermoid cysts usually seek medical advice for the cosmetic reasons because of the embarrassing look of the prominent unilateral or bilateral ears. The treatment of postauricular dermoid cyst is complete surgical excision of the cyst wall. Incomplete removal may result in recurrence or infection; thus, complete surgical excision is necessary. The prognosis is excellent without further complication.

### Infected simple renal cyst due to Streptococcus pneumoniae rapidly diagnosed by the melting temperature mapping method: a case report [^117RHL9T]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

The international consensus statement on the management of infected ADPKD in children was published recently, but so far, there is no solid evidence in the medical literature for the optimal management to treat an infected renal cyst. Surgical intervention is favored because of poor antibiotic penetration to the infected renal cyst. Ohkawa et al. intramuscularly injected amikacin into 9 patients with simple renal cysts and 2 patients with infectious renal cysts and measured the concentration of antibiotics in the cyst fluid. In the case of uninfected simple renal cysts, the drug concentration of the cysts was at the detection limit, while in infectious renal cysts, it was less than half of that in the serum. Patterson suggested percutaneous drainage combined with a two-week course of antibiotics for treatment. In our case, drug-susceptibility testing against S. pneumoniae demonstrated sensitivity to all first-line drugs, but initial medical treatment with the antimicrobial agent did not sufficiently improve the disease activity of the infected renal cyst because of poor drug penetration. Percutaneous drainage and subsequent 2-week antibiotic treatment were implemented and improved the condition of the patient. Transdermal suction or drainage may be necessary because infectious simple renal cysts do not provide adequate antimicrobial penetration.

In conclusion, we first reported a patient with a simple renal cyst infected with S. pneumoniae, as detected by the Tm mapping method, who showed negative culture of the drainage. Rapid identification of the microorganism allowed us to perform appropriate antimicrobial treatment and decrease the cost. The Tm mapping method, which has a high sensitivity, may be a useful antimicrobial stewardship tool for targeting antimicrobial therapy.

### Healing by primary versus secondary intention after surgical treatment for pilonidal sinus [^116e5b8z]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Pilonidal sinus arises in the hair follicles in the buttock cleft at the bottom of the backbone. The estimated incidence is 26 per 100,000, people, affecting men twice as often as women. The mean age of presentation is 21 years (men) and 19 years (women) respectively. Pilonidal sinus results in chronic discharging wounds that cause pain and impact upon quality of life and social function. These sinuses may become infected and present as acute abscesses. Management of these abscesses is uncontroversial and revolves around incision and drainage, however, the mode of surgical management of the chronic discharging sinus is debatable. Surgical strategies traditionally centre on excision of the sinus tracts followed by primary closure and healing by primary intention or leaving the wound open to heal by secondary intention. There is uncertainty as to whether open or closed surgical management is more effective.

Objectives

To determine the relative effects of open compared with closed surgical treatment for pilonidal sinus on the outcomes of time to healing, infection and recurrence rate.

Search Strategy

We sought relevant trials from the Wounds Group Specialised Register (Searched 13/6/07); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2007, Issue 2); Ovid MEDLINE (1950 - May Week 5 200&); Ovid EMBASE (1980–2007 Week 23); Ovid CINAHL (1982 - June Week 2 2007). We checked the bibliographies of review and primary articles for relevant studies and contacted authors of all included studies.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating open with closed surgical treatment for pilonidal sinus. Exclusion criteria were: non-RCTs; children aged younger than 14 years and studies of pilonidal abscess.

Data Collection and Analysis

Screening of eligible studies, data extraction and methodological quality assessment of trials were conducted independently by two review authors. Data from eligible studies were recorded using data extraction forms and any disagreements were referred to a third review author. Results were presented using mean differences for continuous outcomes and relative risk with 95% confidence intervals for dichotomous outcomes.

Main Results

Eighteen studies were included (1573 patients). Twelve RCTs compared open healing with primary closure, 10 of which used midline closure and 2 trials used off-midline closure. Six studies compared midline and off-midline closure. Open compared with closed techniques: Evidence suggested more rapid healing after primary closure although there was no difference in the infection rate after wound closure. Recurrence was less likely to occur after open healing (RR 0.42; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.66) suggesting a 58% lower risk of recurrence after open wound healing compared with primary closure. Patients returned to work earlier after primary closure (WMD 10.48 days 95% CI 5.75 to 15.21 days). There was no difference between the two groups for other complications and length of stay. There were few useable data on cost, patient satisfaction and pain. Closed midline compared with closed off-midline: there was good evidence of slower healing, higher rates of infection (RR 4.70; 95% CI 1.93 to 11.45), higher rates of recurrence (Peto OR 4.95; 95% CI 2.18 to 11.24) and other complications (RR 8.94; 95% CI 2.10 to 38.02) after midline primary closure compared with off-midline closure techniques.

Authors' Conclusions

No clear benefit was shown for surgical management by primary closure or open healing by secondary intention. A clear benefit was shown for off-midline closure rather than midline closure after pilonidal sinus surgery. Off-midline closure should be the standard management when primary closure is the desired surgical option.

### Analysis of national outcomes for simple versus complex nasal dermoid cyst excision [^111nGC9u]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Nasal dermoid cysts represent a spectrum of complexity from dermal sacs to multiloculated sinus tracts with intracranial extension with treatments ranging from outpatient excision to transcranial procedures involving dissection of the dermoid from the dura mater. In this study, the authors examined national outcomes across the spectrum utilizing the NSQIP database. Interestingly, complication rates were uniformly low at 1.2% even though those requiring transcranial excision required significantly longer surgical procedures (P = 0.001), and were significantly more likely to be admitted as inpatients (P < 0.001). Risk factors for longer surgery included patients with comorbidities (P = 0.006), patients requiring rhinoplasty (P = 0.001), and patients requiring a craniotomy (P = 0.023). While uncommon (0.3%), infectious complications remain primary drivers of postoperative morbidity. The NSQIP database does not allow for calculation of recurrence risk, likely a driver of poorer long-term outcomes, and efforts to quantify recurrence risk will be the subject of future research.

### Congenital spinal dermal tract: how accurate is clinical and radiological evaluation? [^116tvP83]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

OBJECT A dermal sinus tract is a common form of occult spinal dysraphism. The presumed etiology relates to a focal failure of disjunction resulting in a persistent adhesion between the neural and cutaneous ectoderm. Clinical and radiological features can appear innocuous, leading to delayed diagnosis and failure to appreciate the implications or extent of the abnormality. If it is left untreated, complications can include meningitis, spinal abscess, and inclusion cyst formation. The authors present their experience in 74 pediatric cases of spinal dermal tract in an attempt to identify which clinical and radiological factors are associated with an infective presentation and to assess the reliability of MRI in evaluating this entity. METHODS Consecutive cases of spinal dermal tract treated with resection between 1998 and 2010 were identified from the departmental surgical database. Demographics, clinical history, and radiological and operative findings were collected from the patient records. The presence or absence of active infection (abscess, meningitis) at the time of neurosurgical presentation and any history of local sinus discharge or infection was assessed. Magnetic resonance images were reviewed to evaluate the extent of the sinus tract and determine the presence of an inclusion cyst. Radiological and operative findings were compared. RESULTS The surgical course was uncomplicated in 90% of 74 cases eligible for analysis. Magnetic resonance imaging underreported the presence of both an intradural tract (MRI 46%, operative finding 86%) and an intraspinal inclusion cyst (MRI 15%, operative finding 24%). A history of sinus discharge (OR 12.8, p = 0.0003) and the intraoperative identification of intraspinal inclusion cysts (OR 5.6, p = 0.023) were associated with an infective presentation. There was no significant association between the presence of an intradural tract discovered at surgery and an infective presentation. CONCLUSIONS Surgery for the treatment of spinal dermal tract carries a low morbidity. While it seems intuitive that tracts without intradural extension carry a low risk of spinal cord tethering, it is not possible to reliably detect these cases using MRI. Similarly, intraspinal dermoid cannot be reliably excluded using MRI and carries an increased risk of infection. These points justify excision together with intradural exploration of all spinal dermal sinus tracts.

### A rare case of eosinophilic cystitis involving the inside and outside of the urinary bladder associated with an infected urachal cyst [^115tRQpv]. BMC Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

The etiology of EC is not well known because of the small number of cases. In most cases, allergies or bladder injuries are present. Since EC is a result of antigen–antibody complexes, avoiding antigens is also an effective method to treat EC. However, finding antigen is difficult in most cases, aside from using bladder instillation therapy. In our case, the patient had no allergies or history of bladder injury, but an infected urachal cyst was incidentally detected. Infected urachal cysts can act as allergens and attract eosinophils to the bladder wall. The infected urachal cyst may also have caused bladder injury due to the mass effect. Hypothetically, bladder inflammation induced by an infected urachal cyst could be the cause of EC. However, because the urachal cyst in our case was small (maximum diameter 1.7 cm) and the patient had no specific history (allergy, medical history, or bladder injury), it is not clear whether the small urachal cyst caused EC in this patient.

There is no definite curative treatment for EC, but medical treatments such as corticosteroids, antihistamines, and antibiotics can be considered as the primary treatment. Corticosteroids can help control inflammation and symptoms, and antihistamines can help suppress the inflammatory reaction, which inhibits the formation of immune complexes. Antibiotics can be used when EC is associated with urinary tract infection. In our case, antibiotics were initially used because the mass was thought to be related to an infected cystic lesion, and antihistamines were used to prevent recurrence after partial cystectomy.

If corticosteroids or antihistamines could not resolve EC, surgical treatment is also an option. Surgical treatment not only has a high treatment success rate, but also a low recurrence rate. In our case, the reason for choosing partial cystectomy was that it required removal of the remnant urachal cyst. On CT, both urachal cysts and EC lesions were visible after TURB, and partial cystectomy was a good option to remove both lesions in one surgery.

### What are the antibiotics of choice for odontogenic infections, and how long should the treatment course last? [^1168DRdA]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

In the everyday practice of oral and maxillofacial surgeons, empiric antibiotics are prescribed in the face of uncertainty. Is there a highly resistant organism present? Are the old-line antibiotics no longer effective? Should a broad-spectrum antibiotic be used just to cover all the bases in this case? The surprising result of this systematic review is that when combined with appropriate surgery, the usual antibiotics are all effective. Safety and cost become the differentiating factors in this clinical decision.

### Recovery after tetraplegia caused by dermal sinus infection: intramedullary abscess and tetraparesis [^114QCM13]. Pediatric Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Congenital dermal sinuses result from abnormal neurulation, and are uncommon. A spinal intramedullary abscess secondary to an infected dermoid cyst is very rare, and the functional prognosis is usually quite poor. We report on a 16-month-old child with tetraplegia secondary to intramedullary abscesses because of a dermoid cyst infection associated with a dermal sinus. The abscesses were drained, and the dermoid cyst was removed. Antibiotics were administered for 6 weeks after neurosurgery. The child was followed at a pediatric rehabilitation department. After 1 year, he was able to walk quickly and had regained appropriate upper limb motor function for his age. However, bladder sphincter dyssynergia persisted, requiring intermittent catheterization. This case highlights the importance of early diagnosis for surgical intervention and prolonged antibiotic therapy. Long-term follow-up by a multidisciplinary team allowed for the effective management of related neurologic, orthopedic, and bladder disorders.

### Clinical management of liver cyst infections: an international, modified Delphi-based clinical decision framework [^116WArYN]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Liver cyst infections often necessitate long-term hospital admission and are associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. We conducted a modified Delphi study to reach expert consensus for a clinical decision framework. The expert panel consisted of 24 medical specialists, including 12 hepatologists, from nine countries across Europe, North America, and Asia. The Delphi had three rounds. The first round (response rate 21/24 [88%]) was an online survey with questions constructed from literature review and expert opinion, in which experts were asked about their management preferences and rated possible management strategies for seven clinical scenarios. Experts also rated 14 clinical decision-making items for relevancy and defined treatment outcomes. During the second round (response rate 13/24 [54%]), items that did not reach consensus and newly suggested themes were discussed in an online panel meeting. In the third round (response rate 16/24 [67%]), experts voted on definitions and management strategies using an online survey based on previous answers. Consensus was predefined as a vote threshold of at least 75%. We identified five subclassifications of liver cyst infection according to cyst phenotypes and patient immune status and consensus on episode definitions (new, persistent, and recurrent) and criteria for treatment success or failure was reached. The experts agreed that fever and elevated C-reactive protein are pivotal decision-making items for initiating and evaluating the management of liver cyst infections. Consensus was reached on 26 management statements for patients with liver cyst infections across multiple clinical scenarios, including two treatment algorithms, which were merged into one after comments. We provide a clinical decision framework for physicians managing patients with liver cyst infections. This framework will facilitate uniformity in the management of liver cyst infections and can constitute the basis for the development of future guidelines.

### Management of cystic hygromas: 30 year experience [^115DYK7c]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Cystic hygroma is a rare congenital malformation of the lymphatic system. In most centers, surgical excision is considered to be the optimal mode of treatment. Spontaneous resolution of cystic hygroma was briefly described in the literature with unsatisfactory results. Between 1970 and 2003, 14 patients were diagnosed to have cystic hygroma (13 cervical and 1 axillary). A retrospective review was performed. All patients were treated successfully with aspiration alone with a mean follow-up time of 5.75 years. Three patients needed multiple aspirations (average 1.66) with complete resolution. Complications were limited to one case of infection treated with antibiotics with no residual problems. Conservative management of cystic hygroma is a reliable mode of treatment with a low complication rate. Intralesional sclerosant injection and surgery should be reserved for other forms of lymphatic malformations.

Human papillomavirus warts — HIV-infected patients: Lesions can be removed by cryotherapy or surgery (BIII), and cryotherapy must be applied until each lesion is thoroughly frozen; treatment can be repeated every 1 to 2 weeks up to 4 times, with the major toxicity being local pain and topical anesthetics favored. Injectable therapy (such as with IFN-α or 5-FU/epinephrine gel implant) should be offered in only severe recalcitrant cases because of inconvenient routes of administration, frequent office visits, and a high frequency of systemic adverse effects. For oral warts, limited lesions can be treated with provider-applied therapies such as TCA or BCA or surgical excision, and extensive lesions should be referred to an expert.

### First case of a renal cyst infection caused by desulfovibrio: a case report and literature review [^11585QSb]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Infected cysts need early percutaneous cyst drainage, which provides the best treatment results because antibiotics alone do not usually treat the infection. In this case, the patient's condition improved after drainage was performed.

For antimicrobial treatment of renal cyst infections, lipid-permeable antimicrobials with high penetration are recommended as first-line agents. Therefore, we also used ciprofloxacin as a quinolone, but with poor improvement. Then, we used meropenem which has been reported to have clinical improvement for cyst infection despite the poor penetration, but there was no improvement. The other antimicrobial agents for this patient were used as empirical treatments.

Optimal antimicrobial therapy for D. fairfieldensis remains controversial. One study showed that metronidazole had the highest antibacterial activity, while imipenem was effective against it. Another study showed that imipenem, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, and beta-lactams, except carbapenems, were ineffective. Lipid-permeable antimicrobials such as metronidazole and clindamycin increase the concentrations of the antimicrobials in the renal cyst fluid. Therefore, oral metronidazole was used for this patient. In addition, D. fairfieldensis may be more resistant to antimicrobial agents and have higher pathogenicity than other Desulfovibrio species. Metronidazole was effective with good blood levels in the renal cysts of patients with ADPKD, including those on haemodialysis. Summarising the previous reports of Desulfovibrio species infection, metronidazole showed the highest susceptibility (78%), and clindamycin was also effective (Table 3). However, metronidazole was used in only 23% of the patients; given that D. fairfieldensis is more resistant to antimicrobial agents and more pathogenic than other Desulfovibrio species, identifying the Desulfovibrio species, especially in D. fairfieldensis, by PCR tests, and using metronidazole, are essential for patient prognosis. In addition, because 54% of the patients with Desulfovibrio infection were complicated with other bacteria, there is concern that Desulfovibrio species can manifest when antimicrobial agents which are susceptible to other bacteria but resistant to Desulfovibrio are used (Table 2). The prognosis of Desulfovibrio infection was 11% of death, and treatment should be carefully selected, including appropriate drainage and antimicrobial agents.

Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". Lower-quality tiers are also detailed, including "Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence", where "Recommendation may change when higher-quality evidence becomes available", and "Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence", where "Other alternatives may be equally reasonable" and "Any estimate of effect, for at least 1 critical outcome, is very uncertain".

### Benign acquired superficial skin lesions of the hand [^112Jthvs]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Numerous dermatologic conditions may be visualized by the hand surgeon during office hours, including when examining patients for an alternative chief problem. Although the primary focus of the visit may be unrelated to a skin lesion, it is important for the hand surgeon to be familiar with these lesions to address patient inquiries and determine which lesions may require some form of treatment. This article reviews some of the most common benign acquired superficial skin lesions of the hand. Particular attention will be paid to epidermal lesions, pigmented lesions, vascular lesions, dermal fibrous/fibrohistiocytic lesions, and infections that can be confused with skin neoplasms or tumor-like conditions. Diagnostic clues, including photographs, will be provided for each lesion described, as well as the recommended treatment.

Management of complications

Abdominal pain

Abdominal pain is reported in 10–20% of children with ADPKD. As abdominal and back pain are very common symptoms among children and adolescents in general, further investigations and treatment need to be guided by acuity, intensity and associated findings(Box 9). Even in the early stages of ADPKD, episodes of nonspecific abdominal pain are frequently reported by adults and tend to be underestimated by physicians. However, patients might have a biased perception of pain, especially if investigations for abdominal pain led to their incidental diagnosis of ADPKD. Chronic pain requires a multidisciplinary approach to avoid overtreatment or undertreatment and to improve self-management. Chronic and/or high-dose use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) should be avoided because of potential renal adverse effects.

Urinary tract and cyst infections

Cohort studies suggest an increased incidence of UTIs in children with ADPKD (up to 15–25%). These studies may be biased as imaging for UTI may have prompted the diagnosis of ADPKD. As no studies have suggested an increased incidence of complicated or prolonged infections in children with ADPKD, local standards for the diagnosis and treatment of UTI in otherwise healthy children should be applied.

Suspicion of upper UTI in children with ADPKD should lead to examination of urine (and blood) cultures, as well as renal ultrasonography, much the same as in otherwise healthy children. Cyst infection is a very rare complication of childhood ADPKD. If suspected clinically or on ultrasonography imaging, experience in adults suggests that 18 F-FDG–PET/computed tomography (CT) is superior to contrast CT or MRI to confirm the diagnosis and localize the infected cyst, but this approach can produce false-negative results. Treatment of cyst infection has a high failure rate and requires long-term use of antibiotics. Precise localization of an infected cyst can be extremely difficult in patients with many cysts but is necessary only for refractory infection when cyst drainage may be required.

Sayed. Hidradenitis Suppurativa Management Update. Obstet Gynecol 2021.

Diagnosis is based on the clinical criteria of 1) typical inflammatory lesions: abscesses, nodules, and tunnels (openings at the skin surface, sometimes draining malodorous fluid), 2) in intertriginous locations (eg, axilla, inframammary areas, crural folds), with 3) history of recurrence. Disease progression can be staged using the Hurley classification system: stage I connotes the absence of tunnels or scarring, stage II connotes the presence of tunnels or scarring interspersed among areas of normal skin, stage III connotes diffuse tunnels or scarring replacing all, or nearly all, normal skin in an entire anatomic region. Female and male patients with hidradenitis suppurativa have a similar likelihood of axillary involvement, with females more commonly having disease activity in mammary, intermammary, and inguinofemoral regions, and males more commonly having sequelae in perianal, perineal, and buttock regions; it is unknown whether the frequency of misdiagnosis differs for men and women. Principal diseases in the differential diagnosis include inflamed epidermal inclusion cyst (or epidermoid cyst), nodulocystic acne, and furuncle (or carbuncle) (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Furuncles and inflamed epidermal inclusion cysts typically have a punctum, are not predominantly localized in intertriginous areas, and with inflamed cysts there is typically a chronic history of a noninflamed cyst present before onset of inflammation. Nodulocystic acne typically is localized to the face and torso, and acne lesions do not typically form tunnels.

### Ultrasound-guided triamcinolone injections for hidradenitis suppurativa lesions: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1152vKr8]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The first step in incorporating US into TAC injection technique for HS lesions is proper identification of the lesion type. It is essential to note that HS lesions may appear differently on clinical and US examination, thus the clinical terms nodule, abscess, and tunnel are replaced with US‐specific terminology of pseudocyst, fluid collection, and tunnel, respectively. Pseudocysts appear as round or oval‐shaped, hypoechoic or anechoic structures on US examination (Figure 1). Fluid collections appear as anechoic or hypoechoic sac‐like structures (Figure 2). Tunnels appear as anechoic or hypoechoic band‐like structures (Figure 3). Once the lesion has been identified, various modes on US devices can be used to further assess the features of the lesion including its depth, dimensions, echogenicity of surrounding tissue, vascularity, inflammation, and degree of fibrosis. These features can provide a baseline for comparison after treatment and aid in procedural planning prior to injection.

When using US to guide injection, the probe should be held perpendicular to the skin with enough sterile gel to cover the probe. The positioning of the needle relative to the US device will impact the visibility of the needle tip, which is essential to ensure that injection occurs at the intended location. There are 2 commonly used techniques. The first involves placement of the needle along the long plane of the probe. This technique allows for better visualization of the entire needle as it advances; however, it can be challenging to stay in the correct plane throughout the procedure. Alternatively, the needle can be inserted along the short plane of the probe (Figure 4). This provides a more limited view of the needle point; however, it is less technically challenging. The needle should enter the skin at a 30–45‐degree angle.

Simple abscess

Cutaneous abscesses are collections of pus within the dermis and deeper tissues.

To be considered a simple abscess, induration and erythema should be limited only to a defined area of the abscess and should not extend beyond its the borders of the abscess. Additionally, simple abscesses should not have extension into deeper tissues or multiloculated extension.

Epidermoid cysts, often named "sebaceous cysts", are usually due to infection of pilosebaceous gland and are present anywhere in the body lined by squamous epithelium.

Furuncles also named "boils" are superficial infections with suppuration of the hair follicle, usually caused by S. aureus. They extend through the dermis into the subcutaneous tissue, where form a small abscess. Furuncles can occur anywhere on hairy skin. A group of infected hair follicles with pus is named carbuncle. Carbuncles are larger and deeper than furuncles. Furuncles often rupture and drain spontaneously or following treatment with moist heat. Most large furuncles and all carbuncles should be treated with incision and drainage. Excision of carbuncle with primary split-thickness skin grafting is an alternative treatment modality.

A recurrent abscess at a site of previous infection may be caused by local causes such as a pilonidal cyst, hidradenitis suppurativa, or foreign material. Therefore, it always requires research of a local cause.

Treatment
Incision and drainage
Antibiotic therapy only in selected patients for 5 days. You may extend therapy up to 7–10 days if lack of symptom resolution at 5 days

Incision, evacuation of pus and debris, and probing of the cavity to break up loculations provide effective treatment of cutaneous abscesses. The resultant wound should be left open and lightly packed with roll gage soaked with antiseptic solution.

Antibiotic therapy should be prescribed for abscesses greater than 5 cm, in an area difficult to drain (e.g. face, hand, and genitalia), if there is lack of response to incision and drainage alone, if there are multiple localizations and in patients with immunosuppression.

### Procedure description… [^113BZEL5]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

The cysts contain keratin and lipid, and the rancid odor often associated with these cysts relates to the relative fat content, bacterial infection, or decomposition. Spontaneous rupture discharges the soft, yellow keratin material into the dermis. A tremendous inflammatory response ensues, often producing a purulent material. Scarring makes removal more difficult. There are many surgical approaches to epidermoid cysts. While complete surgical excision can ensure removal of the sac and prevent recurrence, this technique is time-consuming and requires suture closure. The minimal excision technique has been proposed as a less invasive and successful intervention. The minimal excision technique involves a 2- to 3-mm incision, expression of the cyst contents, and extraction of the cyst wall through the incision. Simple incision and drainage of cysts frequently results in recurrence.

Two iodine crystals can be placed in the center of the cyst and, during the next few weeks, the cyst will become dark brown and hard. This hard nodule can then be expressed from the skin. This simple technique is inexpensive, but the need for a follow-up visit and the length of time for lesion removal may make this technique less desirable to many patients. Procedure Description 1. The skin overlying the site is cleansed with povidone-iodine solution. The skin overlying the cyst and the tissue to the sides and beneath the cyst are anesthetized with 2 percent lidocaine with epinephrine.
2. A fenestrated drape can be placed on the patient, with the lesion beneath the fenestration. A no. 11 blade is used to create a stab incision into the center of the cyst. A small-tipped hemostat is placed into the cyst, the tips gently opened and compression applied to allow the cyst con tents to pass through the opening. The sac may break, and several pieces may need to be removed.
5.

At the end of the procedure, the wound should be inspected to ensure that all of the cyst wall has been removed. The cyst wall can be pieced together to provide additional confirmation of complete removal.
6. Direct pressure is applied to the site with gauze. Antibiotic ointment is applied and gauze is taped over the site. The patient is encouraged to hold direct pressure to the site for one to two hours following the procedure. Most small incisions do not require suture closure.

Question 2: What is the preferred treatment?
A. Root canal therapy or extraction
B. Intravenous vancomycin
C. Incision and drainage
D. Radiation therapy
E. Discharge home with oral antibiotics

Answers:
A. Root canal therapy or extraction – Correct. The preferred treatment is root canal therapy (for a restorable tooth) or extraction (for a nonrestorable tooth), after which the sinus tract and associated cutaneous lesion usually resolve within 5 to 14 days. Dental sinuses tend to heal with mild dimpling and hyperpigmentation, which usually improve over time.
B. Intravenous vancomycin – Incorrect. Intravenous vancomycin is the preferred treatment for osteomyelitis but would not be effective in treating a cutaneous sinus of dental origin.
C. Incision and drainage – Incorrect. Nearly 50% of patients reported as having a dental sinus have undergone multiple courses of antibiotics, along with incision and drainage attempts. However, these do not lead to permanent resolution of the sinus.
D. Radiation therapy – Incorrect. This patient does not exhibit signs of squamous cell carcinoma or other forms of cancer that would require radiation therapy.
E. Discharge home with oral antibiotics – Incorrect. The patient has had a draining lesion for many years because of tooth decay. He requires definitive (root canal or tooth extraction) treatment; oral antibiotics will not permanently treat the sinus.

Question 3: Which of the following is true regarding the prognosis of this condition?
A. The prognosis is good, and this condition can be managed with oral antibiotics in the outpatient setting
B. The 5-year relative survival rate for a specific stage of this condition is 80%
C. This condition is considered a benign disease but may recur after treatment in more than 40% of cases
D. Although commonly misdiagnosed, this condition has an excellent prognosis once proper endodontic therapy is performed
E. There is an overall poor prognosis of this condition, with the 5-year survival between 10% and 50%

Answers:
A. The prognosis is good, and this condition can be managed with oral antibiotics in the outpatient setting – Incorrect. This refers to the prognosis of erysipelas, which is usually managed in the outpatient setting with oral antibiotics. Importantly, hospitalization for intravenous antibiotics may be considered in severe cases affecting those who are immunocompromised, infants, and the elderly.
B. The 5-year relative survival rate for a specific stage of this condition is 80% – Incorrect. There are 4 widely recognized types of KS; however, they differ in epidemiology and prognosis. The 5-year relative survival rate for KS, which compares people with the same type and stage of KS to people in the overall population, is 80%.
C. This condition is considered a benign disease but may recur after treatment in more than 40% of cases – Incorrect. The prognosis described here is in reference to angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia. Although spontaneous regression may occasionally occur, angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia tends to persist for years, with recurrence after treatment in more than 40% of cases. Early age of onset, long disease duration, multiple lesions, and symptomatic disease have been associated with higher recurrence rates.
D. Although commonly misdiagnosed, this condition has an excellent prognosis once proper endodontic therapy is performed – Incorrect. Cutaneous dental sinus tract is frequently misdiagnosed due to its rarity of occurrence and lack of associated symptoms. Once diagnosed, however, definitive treatment through oral therapy to eliminate the source of infection, whether it is through endodontic treatment or extraction, is effective and provides a cure.
E. There is an overall poor prognosis of this condition, with the 5-year survival between 10% and 50% – Correct. Angiosarcomas make up less than 1% of all sarcomas, with approximately 2 to 3 new cases per 1 million diagnoses yearly. Importantly, many angiosarcomas are highly aggressive, with a 5-year survival between 10% and 50% and a median overall survival ranging from 30 to 50 months. The clinical variability of these tumors contributes to delayed diagnosis, and that, coupled with their genetic heterogeneity, makes them difficult to treat. Surgical excision with wide margins is considered the mainstay of therapy in localized disease; however, the infiltrative and satellite foci often lead to difficulty in obtaining negative margins and frequent local recurrences. Thus, a multimodal approach, which often includes radiation, is often necessary. Our patient was treated with wide local excision followed by adjuvant radiation given positive margins. He remains without evidence of disease at 2 years.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^114eVQHn]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What are necrotizing infections?

Necrotizing soft-tissue infections (NSTIs) are life-threatening, invasive, soft-tissue infections with a necrotizing component involving any or all layers of the soft-tissue compartment, from the superficial dermis and subcutaneous tissue to the deeper fascia and muscle. The latter is most commonly called "necrotizing fasciitis".

The necrotizing or non-necrotizing character of the infection should be always specified when classifying patients with soft-tissue infections (recommendation 1C).

Delay in diagnosis and delay in treatment of these infections increase the risk of mortality. Because of its aggressive character, NSTIs should always be differentiated from non-necrotizing infection. Several definitions were published over the last few years, and all these definitions can be confusing. NSTIs are defined by the presence of a spreading infection in any of the layers of the soft tissues (skin, subcutaneous tissue, superficial fascia, deep fascia, or muscles) which is associated with the presence of necrosis of the layer(s) involved and hence requires surgical debridement. All NSTIs fulfill this definition and have common features in their clinical presentation and diagnosis, and most importantly, all of these infections by definition require surgical debridement. Therefore, labeling them with different terms does not serve a useful purpose and may in fact complicate management by delaying diagnosis and/or delaying surgical debridement.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113UkXua]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

IDSA 2014 SSTI guideline — cutaneous abscess and inflamed epidermoid cyst management emphasizes that aspiration was successful in only 25% of cases overall and < 10% with MRSA infections, and accordingly, this form of treatment is not recommended. Simply covering the surgical site with a dry dressing is usually the easiest and most effective treatment of the wound, and one small study found that packing caused more pain and did not improve healing when compared to just covering the incision site with sterile gauze. The addition of systemic antibiotics to incision and drainage of cutaneous abscesses does not improve cure rates, even in those due to MRSA, but systemic antibiotics should be given to patients with severely impaired host defenses or signs or symptoms of systemic infection; multiple abscesses, extremes of age, and lack of response to incision and drainage alone are additional settings in which systemic antimicrobial therapy should be considered.

Question 2: Which of the following statements regarding acquired digital fibrokeratoma is true?
A. Acquired fibrokeratoma is a commonly reported tumor
B. Acquired fibrokeratoma is common in children
C. Acquired fibrokeratoma is usually asymptomatic
D. Acquired fibrokeratoma is associated with viral infection
E. The histopathology shows neural bundles

Answers:
A. Acquired fibrokeratoma is a commonly reported tumor–Incorrect. Acquired fibrokeratoma is uncommonly reported. The actual incidence is unknown, with most cases published as case reports.
B. Acquired fibrokeratoma is common in children–Incorrect. The tumor occurs more often in middle-aged adults, with a 1:1 male-to-female ratio.
C. Acquired fibrokeratoma is usually asymptomatic–Correct. It usually presents as a solitary asymptomatic nodule smaller than 1 cm but may occasionally present as a large, painful nodule (giant acquired fibrokeratoma).
D. Acquired fibrokeratoma is associated with viral infection–Incorrect. The exact pathophysiology is unclear. It is thought to be associated with trauma or repetitive irritation. An infectious cause has also been proposed as there have been reports of cases that occurred after a staphylococcal infection. There was a case that occurred with gingival overgrowth after ciclosporin treatment.
E. The histopathology shows neural bundles–Incorrect. Histopathology typically shows hyperkeratotic and acanthotic epidermis with thick collagen bundles oriented along the vertical axis in the dermis. Kint et alclassified acquired digital fibrokeratoma into 3 different histologic variants. Type I, which is the most common variant, usually presents as a dome-shaped lesion that contains a core of thick, densely packed collagen bundles with fine elastic fibers and a hyperkeratotic epidermis. Type II is a tall and hyperkeratotic lesion that contains more fibroblasts and collagen bundles that are more regularly arranged than the first type with less elastic fibers. Type III, which is the least common type, typically presents as a flat to dome-shaped lesion with poorly cellular structure and absent elastic fibers.

### Influence factor in thickness of cyst wall of epidermal cysts [^117Fgutx]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

An epidermal cyst is one of the most common benign tumors of the skin and its major treatment method is excision. Surgical excision is treatment of choice for epidermal cysts, but the cyst wall may be ruptured during operation, especially when the cyst wall is relatively thin. The incomplete excision of the cyst sometimes occurs because of a rupture of the cyst and incomplete excision may cause recurrence. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the factors that can influence the thickness of the cyst wall of epidermal cysts.

Methods

From December 2008 to November 2013, medical records and tissue pathology slides of 290 patients with an epidermal cyst were reviewed retrospectively. The relationships among the regions, history of infection, the age of patients, and the thickness of the cyst and epidermis were analyzed.

Results

There was no difference between thickness of cyst wall and site of occurrence and between thickness of epidermis and site of occurrence. The thickness of epidermal cyst wall with previous infection is thicker than those without infection episode (P = 0.01). However, the difference of thickness of epidermis above the cyst between with and without previous infection is not statistically significant (P = 0.641). The thickness of cyst wall and epidermis showed positive correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.391, P = 0.01).

Conclusion

From this study, there was a tendency cyst wall with the history of infection or incision and drainage is thicker. When surgical excision, more attention to excise epidermal cyst completely is needed for the prevention of recurrence of the cyst.

### Recurrence of skin and soft tissue infections: identifying risk factors and treatment strategies [^112KkDf9]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

RECURRENT ABSCESSES AND PURULENT INFECTIONS

Recurrent abscesses are quite common, with a rate of 7–14% within 2 months of completed therapy.

This condition can relate to local risk factors such as pilonidal cyst or foreign material. A diagnosis of hidradenitis suppurativa, an inflammatory chronic condition, should be considered in case of painful recurrent abscesses, distributed around the groin, buttocks, breasts and armpits, leaving deep scars and skin tunnels. Other risk factors are intravenous drug administration, incomplete surgical debridement during the first episode, as well as colonization with S. aureus and specific immune disorders (i.e. CGD) as aforementioned.

### Epidermal cyst formation of the lip following autologous fat transplant [^112R2c4U]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

AFT, also known as lipofilling, is increasingly being used in cosmetic and reconstructive procedures of the face, essentially for facial rejuvenation, and to correct atrophic conditions. This technique has the advantage over other dermal fillers of being safe because of the biocompatibility of adipose tissue. Complications are rare and include asymmetry, prolonged edema, infections at the injection site or the harvest site, poor fat viability and fat necrosis, graft hypertrophy, and even more serious complications such as vascular embolism when injected in the glabella or temple.

Pseudocysts formation or "oil cysts" have been reported with AFT, mainly with breast surgery and exceptionally following AFT of the face. These pseudocysts do not have a true cystic wall and are distinct from epidermal cysts; they result from fat necrosis and may depend on the method of fat purification and the vascular supply. Another rare type of cystic lesions has also been reported with other dermal fillers such as silicone injections and hyaluronic acid fillers but not with AFT; these cysts result from inflammation, encapsulation, and the formation of a fibrous capsule trapping the filling material. However, to the best of our knowledge, epidermal keratin cyst formation has never been reported after AFT or with any other dermal filler injections.

On the other hand, epidermal cysts are extremely rare on hairless skin, especially on the lips and oral mucosa. Yet, few cases have been reported in the literature without any clear etiology. The proposed mechanism for the formation of such cysts was that of a posttraumatic migration and "implantation" of the keratinizing epidermis into deep tissues; however, a clear injury preceding the formation of the cyst was almost never evident.

A lip cyst developed in our patient a few months after having undergone an AFT. This striking occurrence may be by mere coincidence but could also straightforwardly reinforce the theory of implantation of keratinizing epidermis that may develop during the AFT procedure. The grafted fat tissue itself may also potentially play a role in the induction or progression of this cyst, depending on its quality and its stem cell content, but further similar cases are needed to confirm this theory.

In conclusion, we report a rare case of an acquired epidermal cyst of the lip as a possible complication of AFT. This finding may confirm the hypothesis of a posttraumatic origin of epidermal inclusion of keratin cysts over the buccal mucosa. In this case, a less traumatic technique of AFT might be considered. Treatment of these cysts is surgical and best done with a punch excision and enucleation via an intraoral approach.

### Clinical treatment of echinococcosis… [^1139VRnD]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

At a glance
- Treatment options for cystic echinococcosis include chemotherapy, cyst puncture, and PAIR.
- In some cases, no treatment but a conservative "watch and wait" approach is best.
- Alveolar echinococcosis requires chemotherapy with or without surgery. Treatment options Cystic Echinococcosis In the past, surgery was the only treatment for cystic echinococcal cysts. Chemotherapy, cyst puncture, and PAIR have been used to replace surgery as effective treatments for cystic echinococcosis and, for some cases, no treatment but a conservative "watch and wait" approach is best. Treatment indications vary with cyst characteristics, including cyst type, location, size, and complications. Surgery may be the best treatment for liver cysts that are secondarily infected, or cysts located in the brain, lungs, or kidney. Liver cysts larger than 7.

5 cm are likely to have biliary communication; surgery may be the best option for these cysts. Many abdominal cysts can be treated by injection of protoscolicidal chemical solutions into the cyst, followed by evacuation, prior to further manipulations and extirpation of cysts. For some patients, chemotherapy with benzimidazoles is the preferred treatment. Patients with small cysts or multiple cysts in several organs can be treated successfully with albendazole. Approximately one third of patients treated with chemotherapy with benzimidazole drugs have been cured of the disease and even higher proportions, between 30–50%, have responded with significant regression of the cyst size and alleviation of symptoms. Albendazole has been administered to patients prior to surgery for the intended purpose of facilitating the safe surgical manipulation of the cysts by inactivating protoscolices, altering the integrity of the cyst's membranes, and reducing the turgidity of the cysts.

A third treatment option, PAIR, has been shown to be effective. This option is indicated for patients with relapse after surgery, failure of chemotherapy alone, or who refuse surgery. Treatment during lactation Albendazole is minimally excreted in human milk. WHO has concluded that a single oral dose of albendazole can be given to lactating women.

The most important recommendations, supported by both evidence‐ and expertise‐based data, were used to design a decision‐making algorithm (Figure 1).
(i) Hurley stage I or II – use of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or pristinamycin for 7 days; for preventive treatment or postacute care, co‐trimoxazole or cyclines; for follicular HS ('punched‐out' scars, ice‐pick scars, follicular epidermal cysts, comedones and pilonidal sinus), oral retinoid.
(ii) Hurley stage II or III – ceftriaxone/metronidazole or levofloxacin/clindamycin for 15–21 days. Anti‐tumour necrosis factor (TNF)‐α can be proposed, but should be re‐evaluated within 3–6 months. Specialized, multidisciplinary care (involving a dermatologist and a surgeon, at least) is recommended for severe cases.

A medicosurgical approach is strongly recommended for all patients, either after or in combination with medical steps. Surgery (assisted by ultrasounds, probes, etc.) is considered a curative treatment for specific lesions, but surgeons must fully understand the need to maintain adequate margins, as in skin carcinoma surgery, to achieve remission.

### Draining dorsal hand pustules, nodules, and ulcers in a patient with immunosuppression [^1148j7xi]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Question 3: What is a potential treatment for this condition?
A. Topical corticosteroid
B. Azole antifungal or amphotericin
C. Cytotoxic chemotherapy
D. Meropenem
E. Supportive care

Answers:
A. Topical corticosteroid – Incorrect. Immunosuppression including systemic corticosteroids is a risk factor for cutaneous protothecosis. Further immunosuppression would likely exacerbate this condition.
B. Azole antifungal or amphotericin – Correct. Protothecosis can be difficult to treat and may require multiple agents or months of therapy; optimal treatment for cutaneous disease is unclear, although patients with risk for disease spread should be treated more aggressively. Surgical excision or debridement is often beneficial for local cutaneous disease. For deeper or persistent infections, surgical management is combined with azole antifungals or intravenous amphotericin with a tetracycline. Left alone, disease will persist and potentially spread, although systemic or disseminated infection is rare. The prognosis for cutaneous infection is generally positive.
C. Cytotoxic chemotherapy – Incorrect. Cutaneous protothecosis is an infection and would not respond to cytotoxic chemotherapy.
D. Meropenem – Incorrect. This patient was treated with multiple antibiotic courses without resolution. Protothecosis infection is not a bacterial infection and would not respond to conventional antibiotics alone.
E. Supportive care – Incorrect. Cutaneous protothecosis requires treatment to reduce the likelihood of dissemination.

### The importance of timing: evaluating the optimal age for surgical intervention in asymptomatic dermal sinus tracts [^112qbj8X]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Dermal sinus tracts (DSTs) are rare congenital lesions resulting from errors of spinal cord disjunction, leading to a persistent connection between the cutaneous ectoderm and underlying neural elements. As patients are at increased risk of infection and irreversible neurological compromise due to tethering, resection and detethering are recommended as a prophylactic measure. The ideal timing of surgical intervention in an asymptomatic cohort, however, remains unclear.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed at a single institution from 1998 to 2022 of all patients surgically treated for lumbar DST by 10 different surgeons. Demographic, presentation, operative, and postoperative details were obtained. Five patients who presented with infectious or neurological symptoms were excluded from primary analysis. The age at the time of surgery was then analyzed as a continuous variable against the operative details and postoperative outcomes utilizing Spearman's correlation coefficient and the Mann-Whitney U-test.

Results

Fifty-two patients underwent prophylactic surgical excision of their DST as well as detethering. Overall, 65% of patients were female and the median age at diagnosis was 3 months, while the median age at the time of surgery was 7 months. An additional cutaneous finding was identified in 71% of patients, with hemangioma being most frequent (40%). Additional spinal lesions were radiographically identified in 29% of patients, including lipoma (19%), dermoid and epidermoid inclusion cysts (8%), and an arachnoid cyst (2%). Postoperative complications occurred in 8% (n = 4) of patients, primarily related to wound healing (3/4), with significant risk attributed to younger age at time of surgery (mean 3 months, range 1–5 months) (p = 0.01). During 56 months of follow-up, long-term rates of retethering (6%, p = 0.02) and abnormal neurological examinations (8%, p = 0.001) were associated with concurrent lipomas, but not with age at operation.

Conclusions

In a series of 52 pediatric patients undergoing prophylactic resection of a DST with detethering, the complication rate was 8% and was significantly associated with age < 6 months at the time of operation. Associated spinal lipomas significantly influenced long-term outcomes. When evaluating asymptomatic infants with DST, patient age is a significant factor in assessing the risks and benefits of surgical timing.

### Streptococcus sanguinis isolated from filler granuloma: successful treatment with incision and drainage [^112V6rSW]. Dermatologic Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Filler granuloma is considered to be the result of delayed immune responses; growing evidence suggests that they may be secondary to biofilm formation. Dermal filler is technically a foreign body, and as the development of newer generations of dermal fillers lengthens their duration, it is possible that there is also an increased risk of biofilm formation. Here, we present a case report of a patient with Streptococcus sanguinis isolated from a filler granuloma, suggestive of biofilm formation. This case demonstrates the effective use of antibiotics after incision and drainage on antibiotic resistant biofilm.

### Infected urachal cyst: an uncommon cause of severe sepsis in a neonate [^115JiZHv]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

The urachus is an embryological remnant that degenerates after the birth. However, incomplete regression of the urachal lumen results in several conditions including urachal sinus, patent urachus, urachal diverticulum and urachal cyst. The diagnostic and management of patients with urachal cysts remain controversial. Urachal disease is usually initially misdiagnosed. We initially suspected an omphalitis in our patient. Many complications could occur including infection, intracystic bleeding, bowel fistula and malignancy. Infected urachal cysts can mimic appendicitis, Meckel diverticulum or ovarian torsion. They can rarely rupture leading to peritonitis. The most frequent imaging modality used to diagnose urachal anomalies is ultrasound because it is usually available, non-invasive, and cost-effective. However, CT scan is often required to confirm the diagnosis. Infected urachal cyst is often seen on ultrasound as a heterogeneous lesion with posterior acoustic enhancement and complex echogenicity, extending from the umbilicus to the bladder. Infected urachal cysts, although uncommon, are an important cause of pediatric morbidity. Symptomatic infected urachal anomalies can be managed conservatively or surgically. Some authors advocate treatment with intravenous antibiotics alone; surgery is required in selected cases only. However, most authors recommend early drainage of the infected abscess and excision of the urachal remnant as the definitive treatment.

Urachal cyst is a benign disease that can be life-threatening. We suggest that a complete urachal excision as soon as possible remains the best choice. A high index of suspicion is required for timely diagnosis and management of this condition.

### Removal of sebaceous cysts by electrosurgical means… [^1157DMqp]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

MANY METHODS have been suggested for removal of sebaceous cysts of the skin, and each of these aims to achieve the best cosmetic result. A procedure can be termed successful when with the least inconvenience to the patient it eliminates the cyst permanently in the greatest percentage of cases and leaves a minimal amount of scarring. The incision scar which follows surgical operation with the scalpel is quite frequently undesirable. Moreover, it is also often impossible to enucleate infected cysts totally. Many methods have been described to cope with these factors. Before describing a simple electrosurgical method which we have found to be successful in a large series of cases, we here submit a review of several important procedures which have been suggested thus far. HISTORICAL REVIEW Dubois-Havenith and Maes1 described a method of destroying cysts by means of galvanic electrolysis. They cited their experience with several ROBBINS SJ, PENSKY N.

### Anthelmintics for people with neurocysticercosis [^116zWM1c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

White 2018 provides updated guidelines for the treatment of neurocysticercosis by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH). Treatment is recommended for viable cysts, with monotherapy (albendazole) for one to two cysts and dual therapy (albendazole and praziquantel) for more than two cysts. Data from Garcia 2004, included in this review, recruited participants exclusively with viable cysts and showed a significant reduction in the numbers of generalized seizures amongst participants. These findings, along with the data from Carpio 2008, are the main evidence used in White 2018 for viable cyst recommendations. Our findings do not provide sufficient evidence to support or dispute this; data for single viable cysts are lacking, and pooled analyses for multiple cysts have substantial heterogeneity. However, given the trend observed that albendazole may be detrimental with regard to seizure recurrence in participants with multiple cysts (Analysis 1.2), including participants with viable cysts, advocating anthelmintic treatment as standard for patients with multiple cysts should be done with caution. White 2018 advises that corticosteroids be used whenever anthelmintics are used. This could, in theory, mitigate the detrimental risk of anthelmintics in patients with multiple cysts, and our review was not designed to consider the impact of corticosteroids on anthelmintic administration specifically in the meta‐analysis. However, a trend towards harm in participants with multiple cysts receiving albendazole was observed (more seizure recurrence), despite the fact that Das 2007, the largest study contributing to the meta‐analysis for participants with multiple cysts, administered corticosteroids to participants receiving albendazole.

The updated IDSA/ASTMH guidelines recommend albendazole treatment for single enhancing (non‐viable) cysts, which is supported by the results of this review, and no treatment for calcified lesions alone. Extraparenchymal cysts should be treated on a case‐by‐case basis, with the focus of therapy centred around neuroendoscopy, cerebrospinal fluid diversion, or other surgical managements depending on the anatomical nature of the cyst. Given the heterogeneity introduced by the inclusion of Das 2007, a large study that included both intraparenchymal and extraparenchymal cysts, it could be that the inclusion of such complex patients impacted on the results of this trial.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^114qiECt]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What is the best timing of re-exploration?

Consider to plan the first re-exploration within 12–24 h and to repeat re-exploration(s) until the patient is free of necrosis (recommendation 1C).

There is a lack of literature examining outcomes in necrotizing infections when surgical re-debridements are performed in early versus delayed intervals. Scheduled re-explorations should be done at least every 12–24 h after the initial operation or sooner if clinical local or systemic signs of worsening infection become evident, as well as with worsening laboratory parameters (particularly WBC count). Re-explorations should be repeated until the time when very little or no debridement is required.

A prospective observational study by Okoye et al. showed that delayed re-debridement after initial source control in necrotizing infections results in worse survival and an increased incidence of acute kidney injury. The authors concluded that further studies to identify the optimal time interval for re-debridement are warranted.

### Sonography for detection of spinal dermal sinus tracts [^114PP1zj]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

It is well known that spinal dysraphism may be complicated by meningitis as a result of infection traveling from the skin along a patent dermal sinus tract. The only clue is the lower back cutaneous lesions. Our aim was to investigate the correlation between cutaneous lesions, patent dermal sinus tracts, and spinal dysraphism and their complications.

Methods

Five patients (3 female and 2 male) with spinal patent dermal sinus tracts were studied. We used a 7-MHz linear transducer with a two-dimensional real-time sonographic system to insonate and obtain transverse and longitudinal views of the spinal cord and subcutaneous area, extending from the cervical cord to the sacral areas. Subsequently, we performed spinal magnetic resonance imaging in every patient to confirm the diagnosis and to evaluate the intraspinal conditions.

Results

The associated central nervous system anomalies and complications were tethered cords (n = 5), dermoid cysts (n = 3), lipoma (n = 2), central nervous system infections (n = 2), and syringomyelia (n = 1). The outcomes were better in those who received surgical intervention before they were infected.

Conclusions

Early detection of spinal patent dermal sinus tracts and related anomalies was accomplished with spinal sonography and allowed for prophylactic treatment (e.g., early surgical intervention) before the onset of neurologic deficits.

### Factors influencing tissue cyst yield in a murine model of chronic toxoplasmosis [^112XG8nf]. Infection and Immunity (2023). Medium credibility.

The development of new treatments targeting encysted bradyzoites will fundamentally depend on efficient means of generating tissue cysts in vivo for further functional analyses. Here, we build on our earlier work to identify factors influencing tissue cyst yields from infected brains in a murine model of experimental toxoplasmosis. Seeking to optimize the parameters contributing to tissue cyst recovery from the infected brain, we assessed the effects of sex, infection source, serial passage of tissue cysts between mice, and the relative time of harvest on subsequent cyst yield. Additionally, we assessed tissue cyst yields based on mean recovery per infected animal while also considering per capita yields accounting for animals that succumbed to infection prior to harvesting. The latter category proved to represent a significant proportion of animals infected with tissue culture-derived tachyzoites.

The data presented here indicate that tissue cyst yields are impacted by multiple factors, necessitating consideration particularly in the interpretation of drug study outcomes. Currently, drug efficacy is exclusively evaluated based on tissue cyst recovery, the sensitivity of which is limited to under 2 orders of magnitude. Thus, even the most effective experimental drugs which reduce recovery by 80% to 90% fall within the range of cyst recovery in the absence of any drug treatment (data presented in this study). We therefore must reassess overall approaches to understanding chronic infection and focus on the level of encysted bradyzoites, appreciating the heterogeneity of activity within the tissue cyst. The development of these methods, several of which are under way in our laboratory, will greatly benefit from the optimization of tissue cyst yield, considering the factors investigated here and other factors that remain to be identified.

### A new procedure for treating a sebaceous cyst: removal of the cyst content with a laser punch and the cyst wall with a minimal postponed excision [^111uguRH]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Three main techniques are used to excise sebaceous cysts: conventional wide excision, minimal excision, and punch biopsy excision. A new method with two steps is proposed. First, a laser is used to make a small hole for removal of the content. Then the cyst wall is removed entirely with a minimal excision about 1 month later. With this method, the cyst is completely removed with only a small scar. It offers a good alternative for eradication of uninfected cysts, especially large cysts or cysts located in areas of thick skin or cosmetic concern.

Recurrent skin abscesses — appropriate treatment includes the following recommendations: A recurrent abscess at a site of previous infection should prompt a search for local causes such as a pilonidal cyst, hidradenitis suppurativa, or foreign material (strong, moderate). Recurrent abscesses should be drained and cultured early in the course of infection (strong, moderate). Culture recurrent abscess and treat with a 5- to 10-day course of an antibiotic active against the pathogen isolated (weak, low). Consider a 5-day decolonization regimen twice daily of intranasal mupirocin, daily chlorhexidine washes, and daily decontamination of personal items such as towels, sheets, and clothes for recurrent S. aureus infection (weak, low). Adult patients should be evaluated for neutrophil disorders if recurrent abscesses began in early childhood (strong, moderate).

### Gentamicin sulfate (gentamicin sulfate cream USP, 0.1%) [^115KDSXL]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Primary skin infections: Impetigo contagiosa, superficial folliculitis, ecthyma, furunculosis, sycosis barbae, and pyoderma gangrenosum. Secondary skin infections: Infectious eczematoid dermatitis, pustular acne, pustular psoriasis, infected seborrheic dermatitis, infected contact dermatitis (including poison ivy), infected excoriations, and bacterial super-infections of fungal or viral infections. Please Note: Gentamicin Sulfate is a bactericidal agent that is not effective against viruses or fungi in skin infections. Gentamicin Sulfate is useful in the treatment of infected skin cysts and certain other skin abscesses when preceded by incision and drainage to permit adequate contact between the antibiotic and the infecting bacteria. Good results have been obtained in the treatment of infected stasis and other skin ulcers, infected superficial burns, paronychia, infected insect bites and stings, infected lacerations and abrasions, and wounds from minor surgery. Patients sensitive to neomycin can be treated with Gentamicin Sulfate, although regular observation of patients sensitive to topical antibiotics is advisable when such patients are treated with any topical antibiotic. Gentamicin Sulfate Cream is recommended for wet, oozing primary infections, and greasy, secondary infections, such as pustular acne or infected seborrheic dermatitis. If a water-washable preparation is desired, the cream is preferable. Gentamicin Sulfate Cream has been used successfully in infants over one year of age, as well as in adults and children.

### Focal hand lesions: review and radiological approach [^111uqXBy]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Epidermal cyst

Epidermal cysts are common hand lesion resulting from proliferation of epidermal cells within a confined space in the dermis. They can be congenital, a result of occlusion of the follicles by adjacent inflammation or tumour, or associated with human papilloma virus infection. True epidermal cysts result from implantation of epithelial squames into the dermis because of trauma. MR shows a well-circumscribed lesion of fluid signal in the dermis or subdermis (Fig. 2). However, signal on the T2w sequence may be variable depending on the amount of internal keratin debris. Rim enhancement can be seen. Lack of central enhancement is key to distinguish epidermal cysts from more sinister lesions such as neurogenic tumours or sarcomas, particularly if heterogeneous signal is present because of internal debris. They may also be mistaken for ganglion cysts if located close to the joint or tendon sheath.

### Infected congenital pericardial cyst with mass effect on adjacent structures, a rare presentation in an infant in LMIC setting: a case report and review of literature [^111tMPyh]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Giant pericardial cysts are rare mediastinal lesions that can lead to significant morbidity if complicated by infection, compression of adjacent structures, or secondary complications such as right-sided heart failure. This case report highlights the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges of managing an infected giant pericardial cyst in a resource-limited setting in Africa.

Case presentation

A 2 months old infant presented with symptoms of fast breathing, dyspnea, fever, and signs of right-sided heart failure, including peripheral edema and ascites. Imaging studies, including chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT), revealed a large cystic mass in the pericardial region compressing the right heart chambers. Emergency Surgical excision was performed, and histopathological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of an infected pericardial cyst. Postoperatively, the patient recovered well, with resolution of symptoms, including signs of right-sided heart failure, and no recurrence at follow-up.

Conclusion

This case underscores the importance of considering pericardial cysts in the differential diagnosis of mediastinal masses, particularly in the presence of infectious symptoms or cardiac compression leading to right-sided heart failure. It also demonstrates the feasibility of successful management through timely surgical intervention, even in resource-limited settings. This report contributes to the sparse literature on infected pericardial cysts and provides valuable insights into their management in low-resource environments.
