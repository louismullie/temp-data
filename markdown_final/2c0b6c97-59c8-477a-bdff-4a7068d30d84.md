## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which hypothalamic nucleus is responsible for regulating circadian rhythms in humans. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core neuroanatomy of circadian control in the hypothalamus. Then, I should verify the specific location and nomenclature of the master clock. Next, I will review the molecular and network mechanisms that justify calling it the master pacemaker. After that, I should consider how it integrates light input and coordinates downstream rhythms. Finally, I will evaluate the distractors and confirm the best answer choice with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the anatomical context. The mammalian circadian system is hierarchically organized, with a central pacemaker in the hypothalamus that synchronizes peripheral clocks throughout the brain and body; I need to ensure I'm placing the master clock in the correct hypothalamic region and not conflating it with adjacent nuclei that regulate other homeostatic or endocrine functions [^112PNbDB].

> Wait, let me verify the exact nucleus. Multiple authoritative sources converge on the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the anterior hypothalamus as the master circadian pacemaker. It sits above the optic chiasm and receives direct retinal input via the retinohypothalamic tract, which is critical for light entrainment of circadian phase [^113DtAut].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should confirm why the SCN qualifies as the master clock mechanistically. The SCN contains autonomous transcriptional-translational feedback loops (CLOCK/BMAL1 driving PER/CRY repression) that generate near-24-hour molecular oscillations even in isolation, and it coordinates network synchrony among SCN neurons via neuropeptides such as VIP, establishing coherent circadian outputs to the rest of the brain and body [^112stnR4] [^113w9E9S].

> I need to check the input pathway that entrains the SCN to environmental time. Light signals are detected by intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells and conveyed to the SCN via the retinohypothalamic tract. This photic input is the primary zeitgeber aligning internal rhythms to the 24-hour day, and recent work shows the SCN's photoentrainment network is more complex than a simple labeled-line model, with distinct neuronal ensembles engaged at different circadian times [^113pMLLk] [^114xeThw].

> Next, I should review downstream control to ensure the SCN's centrality holds across physiology. The SCN coordinates circadian timing of sleep-wake cycles, body temperature, hormone rhythms (notably melatonin and glucocorticoids), and metabolic processes through multisynaptic and humoral outputs; for example, SCN regulation of glucocorticoid rhythms requires synaptic connectivity to hypothalamic targets, and SCN outputs shape arousal via relays including the dorsomedial hypothalamus and locus coeruleus [^112wbuWw] [^1119G1og] [^113yNQhH].

> Let me consider the clinical relevance to the vignette. Jet lag reflects a mismatch between the SCN's internal phase and the new light-dark environment. Difficulty initiating sleep after travel is consistent with circadian misalignment, reinforcing that the SCN is the key regulator whose phase needs realignment to restore normal sleep timing [^114jKvgw] [^112wbuWw].

> Now, I will examine the distractors carefully. The anterior hypothalamus is a region, not a specific nucleus, and while it contains the SCN, it is too broad to be the best answer. The posterior hypothalamus includes arousal-promoting nuclei but is not the master clock. The supraoptic nucleus secretes vasopressin and oxytocin and is not the circadian pacemaker, even though some SCN neurons are vasopressinergic and contribute to rhythmic outputs [^112wbuWw] [^1164rXBk].

> Hmm, wait a minute — could the supraoptic area be intended to mean the SCN? Initially, I wondered if "supraoptic area" might be a mislabel for the region above the optic chiasm, but that would be imprecise. The SCN is the correct anatomical name for the circadian pacemaker, whereas the supraoptic nucleus is a separate magnocellular neuroendocrine nucleus, so I should not conflate them [^113DtAut] [^1164rXBk].

> Putting this together, I should double-check that the most specific and accurate choice is the suprachiasmatic nucleus. The SCN is consistently identified as the master circadian pacemaker in the anterior hypothalamus, with autonomous clockwork, photic entrainment, and broad control over behavioral and physiological rhythms, making option D the correct answer [^112wbuWw] [^112PNbDB].

> Final answer: D. Suprachiasmatic nucleus of hypothalamus [^112CCG3d] [^112wbuWw].

The **suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)** of the anterior hypothalamus is the master circadian pacemaker [^112CCG3d] that coordinates daily rhythms in physiology and behavior, including the sleep–wake cycle, via intrinsic molecular clocks and photic entrainment from the retina [^112wbuWw] [^1131Pkmq]. The SCN synchronizes peripheral clocks through neural and hormonal outputs, and its disruption explains jet lag and other circadian rhythm sleep disorders [^112PNbDB] [^114jKvgw].

---

## Anatomical location and structure

The SCN is a **paired structure** above the optic chiasm in the anterior hypothalamus, each containing ~10,000 neurons [^112CCG3d]. It receives direct retinal input via the retinohypothalamic tract, enabling light entrainment [^112bsEpf] [^115eYo7U].

---

## Molecular mechanisms of circadian rhythm generation

The SCN's ~24-hour rhythms are generated by **transcriptional-translational feedback loops** [^1168xpPA]:

- **CLOCK/BMAL1**: activate Per and Cry transcription.
- **PER/CRY**: inhibit CLOCK/BMAL1, closing the loop [^1169HjSn].
- **Post-translational regulation**: phosphorylation and degradation of PER/CRY reset the loop [^117ScuFy].

These loops are **cell-autonomous** and self-sustained; synchronization across SCN neurons relies on neurotransmitters such as VIP and GABA [^111oepb7] [^112stnR4].

---

## Neural pathways and connections

The SCN integrates inputs and sends outputs via **key pathways**:

| **Pathway** | **Description** | **Function** |
|-|-|-|
| Retinohypothalamic tract (RHT) | Direct retinal input to SCN | Light entrainment [^112wbuWw] [^1131Pkmq] |
| Supraoptic nucleus (SON) | SCN projections to SON | Regulates vasopressin and circadian hormone rhythms [^1164rXBk] |
| Paraventricular nucleus (PVN) | SCN projections to PVN | Controls circadian hormone release (e.g. cortisol, melatonin) [^1119G1og] |
| Dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) | SCN projections to DMH | Regulates arousal and sleep-wake transitions [^113yNQhH] [^113K5ryR] |

---

## Role in regulating physiological and behavioral rhythms

The SCN coordinates **multiple rhythms**, including:

- **Sleep-wake cycle**: Aligns sleep timing with the light-dark cycle [^1131Pkmq] [^112wbuWw].
- **Hormone secretion**: Regulates circadian cortisol and melatonin rhythms [^1119G1og] [^114uXNc1].
- **Body temperature**: Drives circadian temperature fluctuations [^112wbuWw].
- **Metabolism**: Coordinates metabolic rhythms and feeding behavior [^115NM1Gp] [^111BAVJV].

---

## Influence of external cues (zeitgebers)

External cues entrain the SCN; **light is the primary zeitgeber** via the RHT, aligning internal rhythms to the environment [^112wbuWw] [^1131Pkmq]. Nonphotic cues — feeding, activity, and social interaction — also modulate circadian timing, though to a lesser extent [^113DBBCd] [^112bsEpf].

---

## Clinical implications of SCN dysfunction

SCN dysfunction causes **circadian rhythm sleep disorders** (CRSDs), including:

- **Jet lag**: Temporal misalignment from rapid travel across time zones [^115ECe5g].
- **Shift work disorder**: Misalignment from nocturnal work schedules [^112bsEpf].
- **Delayed/Advanced sleep phase disorders**: Persistent misalignment of sleep timing [^114jKvgw].

These disorders impair sleep, cognition, and metabolism, and treatments include light therapy, melatonin, and behavioral strategies [^115ECe5g] [^114jKvgw].

---

## Summary of SCN function

The SCN is the **master circadian pacemaker** that:

- Generates ~24-hour rhythms via molecular clocks [^112CCG3d].
- Integrates light input for entrainment [^112wbuWw].
- Coordinates peripheral clocks and physiological rhythms [^112PNbDB].
- Dysfunction causes circadian sleep and metabolic disorders [^112wbuWw].

---

The SCN is the **master circadian pacemaker** of the hypothalamus, integrating light input and coordinating widespread rhythms; its disruption underlies jet lag and other circadian disorders [^112CCG3d] [^112wbuWw].

### A clock-dependent brake for rhythmic arousal in the dorsomedial hypothalamus [^113K5ryR]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Animals organize their behavior and physiology in ~24 h periods to enhance survival and fitness. Many of these oscillatory processes are driven by an internal biological clock, which allows organisms to anticipate, rather than react to, changes in the environment –. Arguably the most prominent rhythmic behavior is the daily cycling of sleep and arousal states. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms generating rhythmic arousal remain poorly understood.

In mammals, the master circadian pacemaker is housed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which is essential for rhythms of sleep and wakefulness. In addition, the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) is thought to play an important role in the circadian regulation of arousal. For example, large lesions of the DMH markedly attenuate the cycling of wakefulness and locomotion. The DMH has been proposed to serve as a relay between the SCN and downstream sleep/wake circuits, receiving inputs from the SCN and projecting to the locus coeruleus (LC), lateral hypothalamus (LH), and the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) –. While a few studies have indicated a role for DMH neuronal clusters in modulating sleep/wake, only a single subpopulation (orexinergic DMH neurons), has been previously implicated in regulating rhythmic arousal.

At a molecular level, the circadian core oscillator controls the cycling of thousands of genes. However, only a handful of genes have been suggested to regulate arousal in a clock-dependent manner, and each of these is thought to amplify behavioral rhythms by inhibiting arousal during the animal's inactive phase –. We previously identified Wide Awake (WAKE) in Drosophila and demonstrated its role as a clock output molecule mediating rhythmic changes in sleep/wake states. WAKE appears to function as a dynamic intracellular scaffold, organizing signaling complexes to modulate neuronal activity in a time-dependent manner. In line with its function in promoting cyclical behavioral states, WAKE and its mammalian homolog (mWAKE) are enriched in circadian clock neurons in both flies and mice –. Intriguingly, mWAKE is also expressed in specific brain regions outside of the SCN, many of which appear to exhibit cyclical excitability, suggesting that mWAKE may label rhythmic neural networks more broadly.

### Targeted orexin and hypothalamic neuropeptides for migraine [^114hChZZ]. Neurotherapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Increased Migraine Susceptibility

Hypothalamic-related perturbations, such as sleep disturbances, changes in arousal, and appetite dysregulation, can increase the probability of an attack in addition to being an indication of early symptoms. Sleep and feeding behaviors are regulated by both circadian periodicity and individual mechanisms of which dysfunction could contribute to migraine pathophysiology.

Increasing evidence from clinical and basic scientific research suggests that circadian rhythm dysregulation plays a significant role in migraine susceptibility. The hypothalamus, specifically the suprachiasmatic nucleus, controls the circadian periodicity of biological processes such as sleep–wake, appetite, metabolism, and thermoregulation. Alterations in circadian cycle may alter the threshold for attack initiation, which is supported by hypothalamic modulation of nociceptive processing. Furthermore, migraine shows a pronounced circadian pattern of attack onset with a population preponderance in the morning, especially in chronic migraine, whereas patients exhibit abnormal circadian levels of cortisol.

In clinical practice, patients with migraine commonly report sleep disturbances and circadian disruption as reliable triggers. This can include too much or too little sleep, jetlag, and shift work. Patients also complain about abnormal sleeping patterns but praise sleep itself as an abortive strategy. Additionally, migraine and other headache disorders are associated with sleep disorders, such as insomnia and narcolepsy, and circadian sleep disorders of advanced and delayed sleep phase.

Feeding and appetite also exhibit circadian rhythmicity controlled by the hypothalamus and have been implicated in increased migraine susceptibility and attack symptomology. For example, skipping meals is a common migraine trigger, and attack frequency and severity have been seen to increase with body mass index. Furthermore, migraineurs show altered fasting glucose and insulin levels and, anatomically, appetite regulating hypothalamic nuclei make connections with the TCC and are thought to contribute to migraine symptoms such as loss of appetite in addition to pain modulation.

### The neurobiology of circadian rhythms [^1115yw24]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There is growing awareness of the importance of circadian rhythmicity in various research fields. Exciting developments are ongoing in the field of circadian neurobiology linked to sleep, food intake, and memory. With the current knowledge of critical 'clock genes' (genes found to be involved in the generation of circadian rhythms) and novel techniques for imaging cyclic events in brain and peripheral tissue, this field of research is rapidly expanding. We reviewed only some of the highlights of the past year, and placed these findings into a mutual circadian perspective.

Recent Findings

Recent findings on the organization of the circadian clock systems are addressed, ranging from the retina to the suprachiasmatic nucleus and peripheral organs. Novel developments in sleep, food intake, and memory research linked to circadian aspects are discussed.

Summary

The neurobiology of circadian rhythms is pivotal to the orchestration of the temporal organization of an individual's physiology and behavior. Endogenous circadian timing systems underlie coupling and uncoupling mechanisms of many neuronal and physiological processes, the latter possibly inducing health risks to the organism. The integration of sleep, food intake and memory in a circadian setting has clear potential as a systems neurobiology line of research.

### Suprachiasmatic neuron numbers and rest-activity circadian rhythms in older humans [^112Gcyta]. Annals of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, the master mammalian circadian pacemaker, synchronizes endogenous rhythms with the external day-night cycle. Older humans, particularly those with Alzheimer disease (AD), often have difficulty maintaining normal circadian rhythms compared to younger adults, but the basis of this change is unknown. We report that the circadian rhythm amplitude of motor activity in both AD subjects and age-matched controls is correlated with the number of vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing SCN neurons. AD was additionally associated with delayed circadian phase compared to cognitively healthy subjects, suggesting distinct pathologies and strategies for treating aging- and AD-related circadian disturbances.

### The functional and clinical significance of the 24-hour rhythm of circulating glucocorticoids [^114uXNc1]. Endocrine Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Adrenal glucocorticoids are major modulators of multiple functions, including energy metabolism, stress responses, immunity, and cognition. The endogenous secretion of glucocorticoids is normally characterized by a prominent and robust circadian (around 24 hours) oscillation, with a daily peak around the time of the habitual sleep-wake transition and minimal levels in the evening and early part of the night. It has long been recognized that this 24-hour rhythm partly reflects the activity of a master circadian pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. In the past decade, secondary circadian clocks based on the same molecular machinery as the central master pacemaker were found in other brain areas as well as in most peripheral tissues, including the adrenal glands. Evidence is rapidly accumulating to indicate that misalignment between central and peripheral clocks has a host of adverse effects. The robust rhythm in circulating glucocorticoid levels has been recognized as a major internal synchronizer of the circadian system. The present review examines the scientific foundation of these novel advances and their implications for health and disease prevention and treatment.

### The circadian clock: a manager of biochemical processes within the organism [^112t9UQn]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2003). Low credibility.

The periodic succession of night and day has influenced life on earth for millions of years. Many organisms have "internalized" this periodic change in the form of the circadian clock. Its main function is to organize the time course of biochemical, physiological and behavioural processes thereby optimizing an organism's performance in anticipating changing environmental conditions. Therefore, it is important to understand the underlying mechanisms that connect the core pacemaker, which is located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus, with peripheral organs. Several laboratories set out to identify genes that are under the influence of the circadian clock. It appears that the circadian clock coordinates transcription of key metabolic pathways thereby orchestrating the time course of physiological and behavioural processes. We review these investigations and put our experiments, the comparison of gene expression in SCN tissue of Per2 mutant and wild-type mice, in the context of these findings.

### The brain's master circadian clock: implications and opportunities for therapy of sleep disorders [^115eYo7U]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

The suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) residing in the anterior hypothalamus maintains a near-24-h rhythm of electrical activity, even in the absence of environmental cues. This circadian rhythm is generated by intrinsic molecular mechanisms in the neurons of the SCN; however, the circadian clock is modulated by a wide variety of influences, including glutamate and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) from the retinohypothalamic tract, melatonin from the pineal gland, and neuropeptide Y from the intergeniculate leaflet. By virtue of these and other inputs, the SCN responds to environmental cues such as light, social and physical activities. In turn, the SCN controls or influences a wide variety of physiologic and behavioral functions, including attention, endocrine cycles, body temperature, melatonin secretion, and the sleep-wake cycle. Regulation of the sleep-wake cycle by the SCN has important implications for development of therapies for sleep disorders, including those involving desynchronization of circadian rhythms and insomnia.

### Circadian pacemaking in cells and circuits of the suprachiasmatic nucleus [^115ECe5g]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2014). Low credibility.

With the discovery of the molecular feedback loops that constitute the core circadian time-keeper (see below), recognition of the medical relevance of circadian clocks has burgeoned. First, all major organs have local circadian clock mechanisms; the SCN is not the sole clock, although it is the orchestrator of innumerable clocks distributed across the body. Second, these tissue-based clocks drive the circadian expression of approximately 10% of the genes and proteins expressed locally in a particular tissue. Consequently, vital metabolic processes such as hepatic nitrogen metabolism, gluconeogenesis, cardiovascular function and renal de-toxification all follow precisely defined, interlocking cycles that optimise metabolic performance. The capabilities of brain and body therefore vary as a function of circadian time; thus, we should look upon ourselves as 24-h machines. The value of this circadian machinery is readily taken for granted and ignored but becomes most evident when it is disrupted, with the archetypal example being 'jet-lag' following time-zone transitions. The consequential misalignment of local clocks with each other and with environmental time, as well as the temporal scramble that occurs during their progressive re-adjustment, is reflected in the various aspects of tiredness, mental confusion and general dysphoria. A far more insidious threat to public health arising from clock disruption comes from rotational shift-work, with epidemiological studies revealing significantly increased risks of cancer, cardiovascular disease and obesity, as well as diabetes. Furthermore, animal-based studies have revealed the mechanistic links behind these phenomena, with, for example, circadian disruption leading to insulin resistance. Put simply, if the liver, pancreas and skeletal muscle are not working in time and in tune, effective regulation of blood glucose and insulin is compromised. In addition, there has been a longstanding recognition that psychiatric conditions, especially major depressive disorders, are affected by (and in turn affect) circadian processes. Although mechanistic links remain elusive, animal models have again provided novel insights into how clocks, light, sleep and mood may interact. More immediate in terms of public health is the impact of the loss of tight circadian control of sleep on the care and life quality of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. It is the difficulties involved in trying to care for someone without a regular sleep cycle in a home setting that is the principal cause of institutionalisation, with its incumbent personal, social and economic costs. The hope, therefore, is that by determining the basic molecular and neurobiological mechanisms that govern circadian pacemaking, not only will an engaging piece of biology be decoded, but also new opportunities will be presented to address diseases characteristic of modern society.

### Sleep disturbances in craniopharyngioma: a challenging diagnosis [^1127Gwuo]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

The hypothalamus plays a crucial role in regulating vital functions, such as the endocrine system and metabolic processes and in controlling hunger, thirst, and thermoregulation and its injury can lead to significant endocrinological, neurological, and neurocognitive impairments (especially in memory, learning, and school performance areas). Furthermore, the hypothalamus represents a key component of the sleep–wake regulation system being the suprachiasmatic nucleus identified as the master clock of the circadian rhythm.

Growing data in the literature demonstrate the increased risk of sleep disorders after the onset of tumors involving the hypothalamic area or after their treatment. Sleep fragmentation, impaired sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) are commonly reported in CP with a pattern of circadian rhythm characterized by early morning awakening, followed by an extra period of sleep during the afternoon. Cases of secondary narcolepsy have also been reported, particularly in children (70% of cases of narcolepsy), with CP being the prevalent type (38%) (8). Moreover, several data prove that suprasellar cancer survivors are more likely to have a greater risk for sleep-disordered breathing. Patients undergoing hypothalamic surgery may lose the ability to downregulate appetite, exhibit abnormal food-seeking behavior and rapid weight gain, and develop obesity, resulting in excessive daytime sleepiness through various mechanisms, such as the increased risk of developing obstructive sleep apnea and augmented circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines which in turn impair sleep.

Sleep disturbances assessment plays an essential role in patient management, considering that sleep disturbances can negatively impact several biological functions, cognition, and mood.

Here we describe two cases of patients with CP who developed paroxysmal manifestations, initially misdiagnosed as epileptic episodes, expression of a severe sleep disorder.

### Come together, right… now: synchronization of rhythms in a mammalian circadian clock [^115U7s8M]. Neuron (2005). Low credibility.

In mammals, the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus act as a dominant circadian pacemaker, coordinating rhythms throughout the body and regulating daily and seasonal changes in physiology and behavior. This review focuses on the mechanisms that mediate synchronization of circadian rhythms between SCN neurons. Understanding how these neurons communicate as a network of circadian oscillators has begun to shed light on the adaptability and dysfunction of the brain's master clock.

### Circadian rhythm and sleep disruption: causes, metabolic consequences, and countermeasures [^112wbuWw]. Endocrine Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

II. The Circadian System

A. The suprachiasmatic nuclei

The two suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the anterior hypothalamus primarily coordinate the oscillator systems that temporally regulate physiology and behavior (Figure 1). The preeminent roles of the SCN in locomotor, hormonal, and feeding circadian rhythms were demonstrated by early ablation studies. SCN transplantation into SCN-ablated hamsters confirmed their control of circadian rhythm period and by encasing the SCN in semipermeable membranes that prevented synaptogenesis, the SCN were shown to produce diffusible signals sufficient to restore circadian activity rhythms. Several of these SCN secretions have since been identified.

Figure 1.
Temporal control of physiology. Light exposure provides the primary time cue for the central clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus and suppresses melatonin synthesis by the pineal gland. Artificial light exposure at night can therefore disrupt the SCN clock and melatonin rhythm. As a diurnal species, melatonin is hypnogenic in humans, although a recent prospective study of pinealectomy demonstrated that endogenous melatonin may not have a strong regulatory role in sleep. The sleep/wake cycle has been effectively simulated by a two-process model in which a circadian process (C) influences wakefulness and interacts with a sleep-promoting process (S) that accumulates during wakefulness. Within the hypothalamus — a nodal point of body temperature regulation — the SCN influences the circadian rhythm of body temperature, a key synchronizer of clocks in peripheral tissues. The use of thermostats can obviate daily oscillations in temperature, which could perhaps influence some circadian rhythms. In addition to temperature mechanisms, the SCN influences clocks in peripheral tissues through neural signals communicated via the autonomic nervous system (ANS), as well as the timely secretion of signaling factors such as prokineticin 2. Hypothalamic-pituitary-peripheral organ axes are important to hormonal regulation of the circadian system. For example, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) enters the portal system through the median eminence (ME) of the hypothalamus and stimulates the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by the anterior pituitary gland. ACTH then regulates adrenal cortex production of cortisol, a hormone with a robust circadian oscillation and important synchronizing effects in many peripheral clocks. The timing of metabolic processes in peripheral clocks is also modified by nutritional status, and peripheral clocks relay metabolic information back to the hypothalamus through the ME. Today, around-the-clock access to food can distort the clear feeding/fasting cycles that typified much of our history.

### Sleep and Alzheimer's disease: a pivotal role for the suprachiasmatic nucleus [^111sFcSa]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), which accounts for most of the dementia cases, is, aside from cognitive deterioration, often characterized by the presence of non-cognitive symptoms. Society is desperately in need for interventions that alleviate the economic and social burden related to AD. Circadian dysrhythmia, one of these symptoms in particular, immensely decreases the self-care ability of AD patients and is one of the main reasons of caregiver exhaustion. Studies suggest that these circadian disturbances form the root of sleep-wake problems, diagnosed in more than half of AD patients. Sleep abnormalities have generally been considered merely a consequence of AD pathology. Recent evidence suggests that a bidirectional relationship exists between sleep and AD, and that poor sleep might negatively impact amyloid burden, as well as cognition. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the main circadian pacemaker, is subjected to several alterations during the course of the disease. Its functional deterioration might fulfill a crucial role in the relation between AD pathophysiology and the development of sleep abnormalities. This review aims to give a concise overview of the anatomy and physiology of the SCN, address how AD pathology precisely impacts the SCN and to what degree these alterations can contribute to the progression of the disease.

### The suprachiasmatic nucleus controls circadian energy metabolism and hepatic insulin sensitivity [^115NM1Gp]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus have an increasing prevalence in modern society. In the past decade, a strong and potentially causal relationship between metabolic disorders and disturbances of the circadian system has been elucidated. The circadian system is responsible for 24-h rhythms in a wide variety of physiological and behavioral functions. Generation of these rhythms occurs in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the anterior hypothalamus and is explained by a transcriptional–translational feedback loop involving the clock genes CLOCK, BMAL1, Period (Per), and Cryptochrome (Cry). The rhythms of the SCN are synchronized to the environmental 24-h cycle mainly by light–dark information perceived by the eyes. Rhythmic information is transferred from the SCN to the central nervous system and to peripheral organs of the body. This output is crucial for synchronization of many metabolic and endocrine factors such as glucose, insulin, cortisol, leptin, ghrelin, and neuropeptide Y.

Disturbances in circadian rhythms occur as a consequence of shift work and transitions in time zones, but also because of irregular sleep–wake patterns, aging, or neurodegenerative disorders. Animal studies have indicated a link between clock gene mutations and metabolic disturbances. For instance, Clock mutant mice have a greatly attenuated diurnal feeding rhythm, are hyperphagic and obese, and have development of a metabolic syndrome of hyperleptinemia, hyperlipidemia, hepatic steatosis, and hyperglycemia. Because clock gene mutants are not specific to the SCN, the detrimental effects of disturbed rhythms may have their origin in peripheral organs other than the SCN. It is not clear to what extent the SCN itself is involved in metabolic disorders. Given the accumulating evidence for disturbances of SCN cellular organization in aging, neurodegenerative disorders, and dementia, this question is also clinically relevant, as it would explain comorbidity between various disorders.

To assess the role of disturbed function of the SCN per se in the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, we performed bilateral microlesions of the SCN in male C57Bl/6J mice. Because the SCN is anatomically surrounded by areas regulating energy homeostasis, such as the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN), great care was taken to distinguish between exclusively SCN lesioned mice and mice with collateral damage to surrounding nuclei. We show that selective ablation of the SCN results in complete loss of circadian energy metabolism and, moreover, in the development of severe hepatic insulin resistance, stressing the role of the central clock in the pathophysiology of insulin resistance.

### Discrete photoentrainment of mammalian central clock is regulated by bi-stable dynamic network in the suprachiasmatic nucleus [^115WLRWa]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

To determine whether this network is driven by local connections, we identified neurons with high connectivity based on their correlation coefficients (r > 0.5). We found three distinct functional connectivity maps corresponding to ZT 8, ZT 16, and ZT 22, with no clear spatial clustering among the highly connected neurons (Fig. 5e and Supplementary Fig. 10). We then mapped the correlation coefficients against the inter-neuronal distances during the light exposure period across all three time points. A locally driven network would typically exhibit a negative correlation between neuronal distance and correlation coefficient. Contrary to this expectation, the relationship between the neurons' connectivity and their physical proximity was negligible, with an average r-squared value of only 0.04 (Fig. 5f). Collectively, these observations suggest that SCN neuronal light responses are orchestrated by a complex network architecture in 3-dimensional space rather than simple local circuits.

### Suprachiasmatic VIP neurons are required for normal circadian rhythmicity and comprised of molecularly distinct subpopulations [^113w9E9S]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The hypothalamic suprachiasmatic (SCN) clock contains several neurochemically defined cell groups that contribute to the genesis of circadian rhythms. Using cell-specific and genetically targeted approaches we have confirmed an indispensable role for vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-expressing SCN (SCN VIP) neurons, including their molecular clock, in generating the mammalian locomotor activity (LMA) circadian rhythm. Optogenetic-assisted circuit mapping revealed functional, di-synaptic connectivity between SCN VIP neurons and dorsomedial hypothalamic neurons, providing a circuit substrate by which SCN VIP neurons may regulate LMA rhythms. In vivo photometry revealed that while SCN VIP neurons are acutely responsive to light, their activity is otherwise behavioral state invariant. Single-nuclei RNA-sequencing revealed that SCN VIP neurons comprise two transcriptionally distinct subtypes, including putative pacemaker and non-pacemaker populations. Altogether, our work establishes necessity of SCN VIP neurons for the LMA circadian rhythm, elucidates organization of circadian outflow from and modulatory input to SCN VIP cells, and demonstrates a subpopulation-level molecular heterogeneity that suggests distinct functions for specific SCN VIP subtypes.

### Two decades of circadian time [^115BKfjo]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2008). Low credibility.

Circadian rhythms coordinate our physiology at a fundamental level. Over the last 20 years, we have witnessed a paradigm shift in our perception of what the clocks driving such rhythms actually are, moving from 'black boxes' to talking about autoregulatory transcriptional/post-translational feedback loops with identified molecular components. We also now know that the pacemaker of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) is not our only clock but quite the opposite because circadian clocks abound in our bodies, driving local rhythms of cellular metabolism, and synchronised to each other and to solar time, by cues from the SCN. This discovery of dispersed local clocks has far-reaching implications for understanding our physiology and the pathological consequences of clock dysfunction, revealing that clocks are critical in a variety of metabolic and neurological conditions, all of which have long-term morbidity attributable to them. Without the currently available molecular framework, these insights would have not have been possible. In the circadian future, a growing appreciation of the systems-level functioning of these clocks and their various cerebral and visceral outputs, will likely stimulate the development of novel therapies for major illnesses.

### Metabolic implications of exposure to light at night: lessons from animal and human studies [^116bA3QW]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Lately, the incidence of overweight, obesity, and type 2 diabetes has shown a staggering increase. To prevent and treat these conditions, one must look at their etiology. As life on earth has evolved under the conditions of nature's 24-hour light/dark cycle, it seems likely that exposure to artificial light at night (LAN) would affect physiology. Indeed, ample evidence has shown that LAN impacts many metabolic parameters, at least partly via the biological clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. This review focuses on the impact of chronic and acute effects of LAN of different wavelengths on locomotor activity, food intake, the sleep/wake cycle, body temperature, melatonin, glucocorticoids, and glucose and lipid metabolism. While chronic LAN disturbs daily rhythms in these parameters, experiments using short-term LAN exposure also have shown acute negative effects in metabolically active peripheral tissues. Experiments using LAN of different wavelengths not only have indicated an important role for melanopsin, the photopigment found in intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells, but also provided evidence that each wavelength may have a specific impact on energy metabolism. Importantly, exposure to LAN has been shown to impact glucose homeostasis also in humans and to be associated with an increased incidence of overweight, obesity, and atherosclerosis.

### Pathophysiology of cluster headache: from the trigeminovascular system to the cerebral networks [^113hm1Pp]. Cephalalgia (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite advances in neuroimaging and electrophysiology, cluster headache's pathogenesis remains unclear. This review will examine clinical neurophysiology studies, including electrophysiological and functional neuroimaging, to determine if they might help us construct a neurophysiological model of cluster headache.

Results

Clinical, biochemical, and electrophysiological research have implicated the trigeminal-parasympathetic system in cluster headache pain generation, although the order in which these two systems are activated, which may be somewhat independent, is unknown. Electrophysiology and neuroimaging have found one or more central factors that may cause seasonal and circadian attacks. The well-known posterior hypothalamus, with its primary circadian pacemaker suprachiasmatic nucleus, the brainstem monoaminergic systems, the midbrain, with an emphasis on the dopaminergic system, especially when cluster headache is chronic, and the descending pain control systems appear to be involved. Functional connection investigations have verified electrophysiological evidence of functional changes in distant brain regions connecting to wide cerebral networks other than pain.

Conclusion

We propose that under the impact of external time, an inherited misalignment between the primary circadian pacemaker suprachiasmatic nucleus and other secondary extra- suprachiasmatic nucleus clocks may promote disturbance of the body's internal physiological clock, lowering the threshold for bout recurrence.

### The human circadian system in normal and disordered sleep [^113DtAut]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

The human circadian system regulates rhythmicity in the human body and establishes normal sleep and wake phases. The suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), located in the hypothalamus above the optic chiasm, make up the human pacemaker known as the circadian or biological clock, but other essential parts of the circadian system include the pineal gland, retina, and retinohypothalamic tract. The importance of light in resetting the intrinsic human circadian cycle, the intrinsic period of which is slightly longer than 24 hours, ensures that the human cycle will stay entrained to the earth's 24-hour daily cycle. Within the SCN neurons, circadian rhythmicity is generated by the regular transcription of proteins. Since the circadian system is the foundation of the sleep-wake cycle, disorders and abnormalities in sleep are often connected with disorders or abnormalities in the circadian system. Circadian rhythm sleep disorders, such as jet lag syndrome and shift work sleep disorder, are those specifically attributed to dysfunctions or insufficiencies in the circadian system. Taking into consideration the preeminence of the circadian clock in timing sleep, it is likely that other sleep disorders, such as insomnia, are also linked to circadian system abnormalities.

### Hypothalamic volume, sleep, and APOE genotype in cognitively healthy adults [^111MkNwX]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

In this study we combined cross‐sectional data from two large cohort studies with an age range of 38 years, to investigate whether APOE genotype and older age were associated with sleep dysfunction and structural differences in the hypothalamus. We found that APOE ε4 homozygotes had a significantly larger anterior–superior hypothalamus, an effect driven by differences in younger participants. Furthermore, there was a trend for the association between older age and lower anterior–superior volume to be stronger for APOE ε4 homozygotes and heterozygotes than non‐carriers, suggesting that this subunit may be vulnerable to volume loss from AD pathology. Several hypothalamic nuclei are important for regulating sleep including the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus within the anterior–superior subunit, the suprachiasmatic nucleus within the anterior–inferior subunit, and the dorsomedial nucleus and lateral hypothalamus within the superior–tubular subunit. Consistent with this, we found that a smaller anterior–superior hypothalamus is associated with a higher frequency of sleep disturbances in older APOE ε4 carriers (homozygotes and heterozygotes combined). We also found that older age was associated with shorter sleep duration and lower sleep efficiency in the full cohort, but only in people with a smaller anterior–inferior hypothalamus. Overall, these results suggest that sleep dysfunction with aging, and in APOE ε4 carriers, may be driven by hypothalamic volume loss.

Brain Regions and Circuits Associated with Photoanalgesia

Retinal projections of rods and cones to the brain constitute imaging and nonimaging pathways. Images are formed primarily by activation of corn RGCs, and the functions of the nonimaging pathway are all mediated by a specialized pathway originating from ipRGCs, whose axons project via the optic nerve to the ventral suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), intergeniculate leaflet (IGL)/lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), and olivary pretectal nucleus (OPN). These brain regions, which may be involved in photoanalgesia, are introduced below (Figure 2).

Suprachiasmatic Nucleus

The suprachiasmatic nucleus is a compact, bilaterally paired cell group in the anterior–ventral hypothalamus. It was first identified as a hypothalamic retinal target in rodents, and by implication it was considered as a potential circadian control point following autoradiographic visualization of its dedicated route of retinal innervation — the retina hypothalamic tract. In mammals, it is the site of an endogenous pacemaker that regulates circadian rhythmicity and plays an indispensable role in behavioral, physiological, and hormonal rhythms in response to the environmental light–dark cycle. Suprachiasmatic nucleus also appears to function as a seasonal clock underlying the measurement of daylength. In summary, the SCN is the clock and calendar of vertebrates.

Suprachiasmatic nucleus participates in photoanalgesia probably by projecting to the pineal gland (PG), and the paraventricular nucleus (PVN).

### Circadian tick-talking across the neuroendocrine system and suprachiasmatic nuclei circuits: the enigmatic communication between the molecular and electrical membrane clocks [^1111rTz5]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

Although significant recent progress in circadian neuroendocrine studies now places the activity of the newly‐identified kisspeptin and RFamide‐related peptide at the core of the communication conduits interfacing SCN signals with neuroendocrine activity 111, 112, many key questions still remain. For example, how does circadian information encoded by the hands of the clock (TTFL) translate into meaningful outputs that can be processed by the rest of the brain, including neuroendocrine cells, and how does the brain talk back to sculpt circadian timing in SCN clock neurones? Furthermore, retinal melanopsin neurones that project to the SCN via the RHT also form functional connectivity with a number of neuroendocrine hypothalamic regions 113, 114. Therefore, can environmental light directly modulate the activity of hypothalamic neuroendocrine clock neurones and influence circadian and seasonal timing in these cells? To achieve such communication, signals travelling to and from the TTFL both in the SCN and neuroendocrine clock neurones must flow through the cell membrane (Fig. 3). However, the mechanistic nature of these signals that interweave the molecular clockwork and membrane activity to produce physiological circadian rhythms is largely unknown. This is a dilemma that is now hampering major progress in circadian biology research, although some progress has been made in the SCN. Below, reference is made to the membrane clock as a model for addressing the mechanisms of information flow between the membrane and TTFLs: the all‐important electrical–genetic interplay.

### Neuromedin s-producing neurons act as essential pacemakers in the suprachiasmatic nucleus to couple clock neurons and dictate circadian rhythms [^114uceVU]. Neuron (2015). Low credibility.

Circadian behavior in mammals is orchestrated by neurons within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), yet the neuronal population necessary for the generation of timekeeping remains unknown. We show that a subset of SCN neurons expressing the neuropeptide neuromedin S (NMS) plays an essential role in the generation of daily rhythms in behavior. We demonstrate that lengthening period within Nms neurons is sufficient to lengthen period of the SCN and behavioral circadian rhythms. Conversely, mice without a functional molecular clock within Nms neurons lack synchronous molecular oscillations and coherent behavioral daily rhythms. Interestingly, we found that mice lacking Nms and its closely related paralog, Nmu, do not lose in vivo circadian rhythms. However, blocking vesicular transmission from Nms neurons with intact cell-autonomous clocks disrupts the timing mechanisms of the SCN, revealing that Nms neurons define a subpopulation of pacemakers that control SCN network synchrony and in vivo circadian rhythms through intercellular synaptic transmission.

### The effects of light at night on circadian clocks and metabolism [^115Dy6c7]. Endocrine Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Most organisms display endogenously produced ∼ 24-hour fluctuations in physiology and behavior, termed circadian rhythms. Circadian rhythms are driven by a transcriptional-translational feedback loop that is hierarchically expressed throughout the brain and body, with the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus serving as the master circadian oscillator at the top of the hierarchy. Appropriate circadian regulation is important for many homeostatic functions including energy regulation. Multiple genes involved in nutrient metabolism display rhythmic oscillations, and metabolically related hormones such as glucagon, insulin, ghrelin, leptin, and corticosterone are released in a circadian fashion. Mice harboring mutations in circadian clock genes alter feeding behavior, endocrine signaling, and dietary fat absorption. Moreover, misalignment between behavioral and molecular circadian clocks can result in obesity in both rodents and humans. Importantly, circadian rhythms are most potently synchronized to the external environment by light information and exposure to light at night potentially disrupts circadian system function. Since the advent of electric lights around the turn of the 20th century, exposure to artificial and irregular light schedules has become commonplace. The increase in exposure to light at night parallels the global increase in the prevalence of obesity and metabolic disorders. In this review, we propose that exposure to light at night alters metabolic function through disruption of the circadian system. We first provide an introduction to the circadian system, with a specific emphasis on the effects of light on circadian rhythms. Next we address interactions between the circadian system and metabolism. Finally, we review current experimental and epidemiological work directly associating exposure to light at night and metabolism.

### Glucocorticoids and chronotherapy in rheumatoid arthritis [^117RM5hs]. RMD Open (2016). Low credibility.

The circadian clock and RA

In all individuals, a circadian clock drives daily rhythms in physiology necessary to synchronise the human functions with the 24 h environment.

Therefore, physiological functions under circadian control include the sleep-wake cycle, heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, as well as endocrine gland regulation (ie, gonadal and adrenal steroidogenesis) and immune response. These daily rhythms are controlled by a central pacemaker, which is found in a hypothalamic region located above the optic chiasm called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)(figure 2).

Figure 2
The daily neuroimmunoendocrine rhythms (gonadal, adrenal, pituitary hormones) are controlled by a central pacemaker, which is found in a hypothalamic region called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the central nervous system (CNS). APC, antigen presenting cell; DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone; Th, T helper cell; Treg, regulatory T cell.

The SCN collects from the eyes the light inputs via the retinohypothalamic tract. The central pacemaker synchronises additional peripheral oscillators found locally within organs, tissues and cells. These peripheral clocks are synchronised by the central clock, but are self-sustaining and can be entrained by external cues such as temperature.

A bidirectional interaction between inflammation and the circadian clock has been shown recently, and disruption of the clock has a significant effect on the performance of the immune system, with a possible impact on the pathogenesis of RA. Conversely, inflammation can directly alter cellular expression of core clock genes.

Possible causes of disruption of the clock should include jet lag, causing a desynchrony between the internal clock and the environment, and the condition of night shift-workers. Generally, constant shifts in the daily schedule are detrimental to health and have been linked with an increased incidence of a number of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndromes, diabetes, irritable bowel syndrome and even cancer.

Interestingly, a study in 2010 provided a significant link also between shift work and an increased risk of RA (in women).

Once again, the endocrine system mediates the dissemination of timing signals from the SCN throughout the body and to the immune system, and two night hormones act as circadian agents — glucocorticoids and melatonin (prolactin). Both are important in regulation of the immune/inflammatory response, and contribute to the pathogenesis of RA(figure 2).

### Nuclei-specific hypothalamus networks predict a dimensional marker of stress in humans [^112NNo2T]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

To aid comparison with prior work and the reporting of our results, we assigned each cluster a putative nucleus label (Fig. 1D). This process was largely guided by comparing the location of our clusters with the nuclei described in Mai et al. but also incorporated other previous parcellations. Our own and Mai et al.'s parcellations are shown side by side in Supplementary Fig. 9. The most dorsal anterior nucleus closely resembled what prior animal and human work commonly refer to as paraventricular nucleus, sometimes denoted as Pa, PVH, or PA. which we denote as PV throughout. The cluster ventral to PV most resembled the medial preoptic hypothalamic nucleus (MPO) across multiple previous parcellations,– and the most ventral anterior cluster likely contained the supraoptic and suprachiasmatic nuclei elsewhere referred to as SChC, SChD, SCh, or SO and referred to as SO/SC here. Moving more posteriorly, the cluster posterior to PV was labelled dorsomedial nucleus (DM) and the cluster ventral to DM ventromedial nucleus (VM), both consistent with the same nuclei in previous parcellations. The cluster posterior and ventral to VM was most consistent with the location of the mammillary body in Mai et al.(MM). Finally, the most posterior superior hypothalamus division was labelled posterior hypothalamic nucleus (PH), again consistent with the same nucleus in other work. See Supplementary Table 3 for a side-by-side comparison between our labels and those of previous hypothalamus parcellations.

### Circadian VIPergic neurons of the suprachiasmatic nuclei sculpt the sleep-wake cycle [^112WC5pP]. Neuron (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary

Although the mammalian rest-activity cycle is controlled by a "master clock" in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, it is unclear how firing of individual SCN neurons gates individual features of daily activity. Here, we demonstrate that a specific transcriptomically identified population of mouse VIP+ SCN neurons is active at the "wrong" time of day — nighttime — when most SCN neurons are silent. Using chemogenetic and optogenetic strategies, we show that these neurons and their cellular clocks are necessary and sufficient to gate and time nighttime sleep but have no effect upon daytime sleep. We propose that mouse nighttime sleep, analogous to the human siesta, is a "hard-wired" property gated by specific neurons of the master clock to favor subsequent alertness prior to dawn (a circadian "wake maintenance zone"). Thus, the SCN is not simply a 24-h metronome: specific populations sculpt critical features of the sleep-wake cycle.

### The suprachiasmatic nucleus, circadian clocks, and the liver [^117ScuFy]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

Molecular clocks

In the SCN and in other cells, the core molecular clock mechanism consists of specific genes ("clock" genes). These include Clock (and Npas2), Bmal, the period homologs, Per1 and Per2, and cryptochrome 1 (Cry1) and Cry2. The circadian clock mechanism revolves around transcription–translation feedback loops, in which repression and activation of transcriptional activity are dependent on dimerization, posttranslational modification, and degradation rate constants that define the reactions. Kinetically (in conjunction with a secondary feedback loop comprising nuclear receptor genes, Reverbs and Rors), this system defines an oscillator with a period that is near 24 h. Photic cues channeled via the SCN fine-tune the period to correspond to that of the environment. Information on this period is then transmitted to the periphery. The same molecular clocks are also found in peripheral cells (e.g. kidney, liver, pancreas). They can function autonomously. However, the master clock in the SCN generally coordinates these peripheral clocks by way of the autonomic or humoral (e.g. corticosteroids, melatonin) routes to generate a synchronized signal that aligns metabolic and other activities with environmental conditions.

### Vasopressin and the output of the hypothalamic biological clock [^1164rXBk]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

The physiological effects of vasopressin as a peripheral hormone were first reported more than 100 years ago. However, it was not until the first immunocytochemical studies were carried out in the early 1970s, using vasopressin antibodies, and the discovery of an extensive distribution of vasopressin-containing fibres outside the hypothalamus, that a neurotransmitter role for vasopressin could be hypothesised. These studies revealed four additional vasopressin systems next to the classical magnocellular vasopressin system in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei: a sexually dimorphic system originating from the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the medial amygdala, an autonomic and endocrine system originating from the medial part of the paraventricular nucleus, and the circadian system originating from the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). At about the same time as the discovery of the neurotransmitter function of vasopressin, it also became clear that the SCN contain the main component of the mammalian biological clock system (i.e. the endogenous pacemaker). This review will concentrate on the significance of the vasopressin neurones in the SCN for the functional output of the biological clock that is contained within it. The vasopressin-containing subpopulation is a characteristic feature of the SCN in many species, including humans. The activity of the vasopressin neurones in the SCN shows a pronounced daily variation in its activity that has also been demonstrated in human post-mortem brains. Animal experiments show an important role for SCN-derived vasopressin in the control of neuroendocrine day/night rhythms such as that of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axes. The remarkable correlation between a diminished presence of vasopressin in the SCN and a deterioration of sleep-wake rhythms during ageing and depression make it likely that, also in humans, the vasopressin neurones contribute considerably to the rhythmic output of the SCN.

### Discrete photoentrainment of mammalian central clock is regulated by bi-stable dynamic network in the suprachiasmatic nucleus [^113pMLLk]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

In summary, our methodological approach, employing two-photon excitation for spatial analysis, offers a minimally perturbative tool for studying SCN networks longitudinally. This advancement opens doors to exploring the fine-grained spatial organization of the SCN at single cell level in vivo and its implications for circadian photoentrainment. The identification of distinct neuronal groups that are responsive to light at different circadian times provides new insights beyond the traditional hierarchical model of circadian photoentrainment. This discovery lays the groundwork for future research into the identification of molecular markers and functional roles of the SCN neuronal subtypes, illuminating the underlying mechanisms for matching the endogenous clock with the external light-dark cycle in mammals.

### Circadian rhythms in neurodegenerative disorders [^111JucgY]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Endogenous biological clocks, orchestrated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus, time the circadian rhythms that synchronize physiological and behavioural functions in humans. The circadian system influences most physiological processes, including sleep, alertness and cognitive performance. Disruption of circadian homeostasis has deleterious effects on human health. Neurodegenerative disorders involve a wide range of symptoms, many of which exhibit diurnal variations in frequency and intensity. These disorders also disrupt circadian homeostasis, which in turn has negative effects on symptoms and quality of life. Emerging evidence points to a bidirectional relationship between circadian homeostasis and neurodegeneration, suggesting that circadian function might have an important role in the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, the circadian system has become an attractive target for research and clinical care innovations. Studying circadian disruption in neurodegenerative disorders could expand our understanding of the pathophysiology of neurodegeneration and facilitate the development of novel, circadian-based interventions for these disabling disorders. In this Review, we discuss the alterations to the circadian system that occur in movement (Parkinson disease and Huntington disease) and cognitive (Alzheimer disease and frontotemporal dementia) neurodegenerative disorders and provide directions for future investigations in this field.

### The suprachiasmatic nucleus, circadian clocks, and the liver [^117KcsVN]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

The disruptions of circadian rhythms are maintained across the spectrum of lesions that were applied. Only the effects on the fat mass and on the liver are altered, suggesting a differential mechanism for this effect of SCNx. The extent to which this effect might be dependent on the clock function of the SCN therefore remains to be determined. However, evidence is presented here indicating that control of liver metabolism at the level of the SCN is modifiable.

### The neurobiology of circadian rhythms [^115BLrm6]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

There is a growing recognition that the coordinated timing of behavioral, physiologic, and metabolic circadian rhythms is a requirement for a healthy body and mind. In mammals, the primary circadian oscillator is the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which is responsible for circadian coordination throughout the organism. Temporal homeostasis is recognized as a complex interplay between rhythmic clock gene expression in brain regions outside the SCN and in peripheral organs. Abnormalities in this intricate circadian orchestration may alter sleep patterns and contribute to the pathophysiology of affective disorders.

### The suprachiasmatic nucleus, circadian clocks, and the liver [^115AiVmN]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

The circadian clock system adapts phasic physiological activities, such as sleeping and eating, to environmental cycles. The "master clock" is in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and the principal cue (Zeitgeber) is the light–dark cycle, around which most mammalian (and those of all living organisms) functions have evolved. In our society, with activity 24 h per day, the clock is frequently overridden or does not match the activity schedule, with increased susceptibility to disease (obesity, type 2 diabetes, and their cardiovascular sequelae) resulting.

### Coupling the circadian clock to homeostasis: the role of period in timing physiology [^1124eUYy]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

A plethora of physiological processes show stable and synchronized daily oscillations that are either driven or modulated by biological clocks. A circadian pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the ventral hypothalamus coordinates 24-hour oscillations of central and peripheral physiology with the environment. The circadian clockwork involved in driving rhythmic physiology is composed of various clock genes that are interlocked via a complex feedback loop to generate precise yet plastic oscillations of ∼24 hours. This review focuses on the specific role of the core clockwork gene Period1 and its paralogs on intra-oscillator and extra-oscillator functions, including, but not limited to, hippocampus-dependent processes, cardiovascular function, appetite control, as well as glucose and lipid homeostasis. Alterations in Period gene function have been implicated in a wide range of physical and mental disorders. At the same time, a variety of conditions including metabolic disorders also impact clock gene expression, resulting in circadian disruptions, which in turn often exacerbates the disease state.

### Dynamic interactions mediated by nonredundant signaling mechanisms couple circadian clock neurons [^111oepb7]. Neuron (2013). Low credibility.

Interactions among suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) neurons are required for robust circadian rhythms entrained to local time. To investigate these signaling mechanisms, we developed a functional coupling assay that uniquely captures the dynamic process by which SCN neurons interact. As a population, SCN neurons typically display synchronized rhythms with similar peak times, but will peak 6–12 hr apart after in vivo exposure to long days. Once they are removed from these conditions, SCN neurons resynchronize through a phase-dependent coupling process mediated by both vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and GABAA signaling. Notably, GABAA signaling contributes to coupling when the SCN network is in an antiphase configuration, but opposes synchrony under steady-state conditions. Further, VIP acts together with GABAA signaling to couple the network in an antiphase configuration, but promotes synchrony under steady-state conditions by counteracting the actions of GABAA signaling. Thus, SCN neurons interact through nonredundant coupling mechanisms influenced by the state of the network.

### American diabetes association research symposium: diabetes and the brain [^114GQGaD]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

The theme of hypothalamic/brain/periphery networking was further emphasized in the presentation by Joseph Bass, MD, PhD, from Northwestern University, that focused on circadian regulation of energy homeostasis. Dr. Bass reviewed the discovery of clock proteins in the 1990s, which set the stage for research on circadian function and its regulation in the subsequent years. In mammals, including humans, the CNS "master clock" has been identified as the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), and circadian rhythms are encoded by the sequential and reciprocal expression of transcription activators, CLOCK/BMAL1, that induce expression of the transcription repressors, PER1–3/CRY1–3, that inhibit CLOCK/BMAL1 expression. The cycle of expression takes approximately 24 h and is entrained by light. The SCN has connections with key homeostatic nuclei in the hypothalamus, including the arcuate, paraventricular nucleus, ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), lateral hypothalamus, and dorsal medial hypothalamus (DMH). Thus, there is direct input on behavior, activity, metabolism, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which in turn is a key diurnal regulator of activity and metabolism. Importantly, it is now appreciated that "clock proteins" are expressed in nearly all cells. Peripheral tissue clocks are entrained to food availability, adrenal glucocorticoids, and temperature, all of which can reset peripheral clocks. Although research is only beginning to uncover the complex crosstalk between stimuli and peripheral clocks, molecules that reflect metabolic status such as NAD and the nutrient sensor AMP kinase, relay information to the clocks and connectivity is bidirectional. A current line of investigation is examining the coupling of metabolic processes and CNS clock function. A high-fat diet in an animal model has been shown to increase period length of the daily activity rhythm and to phase-shift metabolic gene expression in the liver and adipose as well as in the hypothalamus. The CNS locus of this effect (SCN per se, or SCN projections) remains to be determined but clearly demonstrates metabolite/CNS clock interaction. Finally, sleep and activity abnormalities such as narcolepsy and genetic evidence in humans with altered sleep patterns suggest that pursuit of this research and links between clock activities and metabolic disease will reveal the importance of clock/environmental coordination to human metabolic health.

### Linking neural activity and molecular oscillations in the SCN [^113ULSeR]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2011). Medium credibility.

Neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) function as part of a central timing circuit that drives daily changes in our behaviour and underlying physiology. A hallmark feature of SCN neuronal populations is that they are mostly electrically silent during the night, start to fire action potentials near dawn and then continue to generate action potentials with a slow and steady pace all day long. Sets of currents are responsible for this daily rhythm, with the strongest evidence for persistent Na(+) currents, L-type Ca(2+) currents, hyperpolarization-activated currents (I(H)), large-conductance Ca(2+) activated K(+) (BK) currents and fast delayed rectifier (FDR) K(+) currents. These rhythms in electrical activity are crucial for the function of the circadian timing system, including the expression of clock genes, and decline with ageing and disease. This article reviews our current understanding of the ionic and molecular mechanisms that drive the rhythmic firing patterns in the SCN.

### Suprachiasmatic nucleus-arcuate nucleus axis: interaction between time and metabolism essential for health [^111BAVJV]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

In mammals, time and metabolism are tightly coupled variables; this relationship can be illustrated by numerous examples, such as the circadian variation in food intake or the circadian response to a glucose bolus. We review evidence that the interaction between the suprachiasmatic nucleus and the arcuate nucleus plays a key role in the execution of these functions. The nuclei are reciprocally connected via different projections, and this interaction provides an ideal anatomical framework to modify the temporal output of the hypothalamus to metabolic organs as a consequence of the feedback from the periphery. The suprachiasmatic nucleus-arcuate nucleus relationship is essential to integrate metabolic information into the circadian system and thus adapt circadian rhythms in core body temperature, locomotor activity, food intake, and circulating molecules such as glucose and corticosterone. With the rise in obesity-associated diseases in the world population, gaining knowledge about this relationship, and the consequences of disturbing this liaison, is essential to understand the pathogenesis of obesity.

### Generation of circadian rhythms in the suprachiasmatic nucleus [^112CCG3d]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2018). Medium credibility.

The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus is remarkable. Despite numbering only about 10,000 neurons on each side of the third ventricle, the SCN is our principal circadian clock, directing the daily cycles of behaviour and physiology that set the tempo of our lives. When this nucleus is isolated in organotypic culture, its autonomous timing mechanism can persist indefinitely, with precision and robustness. The discovery of the cell-autonomous transcriptional and post-translational feedback loops that drive circadian activity in the SCN provided a powerful exemplar of the genetic specification of complex mammalian behaviours. However, the analysis of circadian time-keeping is moving beyond single cells. Technical and conceptual advances, including intersectional genetics, multidimensional imaging and network theory, are beginning to uncover the circuit-level mechanisms and emergent properties that make the SCN a uniquely precise and robust clock. However, much remains unknown about the SCN, not least the intrinsic properties of SCN neurons, its circuit topology and the neuronal computations that these circuits support. Moreover, the convention that the SCN is a neuronal clock has been overturned by the discovery that astrocytes are an integral part of the timepiece. As a test bed for examining the relationships between genes, cells and circuits in sculpting complex behaviours, the SCN continues to offer powerful lessons and opportunities for contemporary neuroscience.

### Circadian tick-talking across the neuroendocrine system and suprachiasmatic nuclei circuits: the enigmatic communication between the molecular and electrical membrane clocks [^115vKMxY]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

As with many processes in nature, appropriate timing in biological systems is of paramount importance. In the neuroendocrine system, the efficacy of hormonal influence on major bodily functions, such as reproduction, metabolism and growth, relies on timely communication within and across many of the brain's homeostatic systems. The activity of these circuits is tightly orchestrated with the animal's internal physiological demands and external solar cycle by a master circadian clock. In mammals, this master clock is located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), where the ensemble activity of thousands of clock neurones generates and communicates circadian time cues to the rest of the brain and body. Many regions of the brain, including areas with neuroendocrine function, also contain local daily clocks that can provide feedback signals to the SCN. Although much is known about the molecular processes underpinning endogenous circadian rhythm generation in SCN neurones and, to a lesser extent, extra-SCN cells, the electrical membrane clock that acts in partnership with the molecular clockwork to communicate circadian timing across the brain is poorly understood. The present review focuses on some circadian aspects of reproductive neuroendocrinology and processes involved in circadian rhythm communication in the SCN, aiming to identify key gaps in our knowledge of cross-talk between our daily master clock and neuroendocrine function. The intention is to highlight our surprisingly limited understanding of their interaction in the hope that this will stimulate future work in these areas.

### Misalignment with the external light environment drives metabolic and cardiac dysfunction [^115g6EWv]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The periodic succession of night and day influences nearly all forms of life on earth. As a result, organisms have evolved internal circadian clocks capable of keeping near precise 24 h time. By tracking time internally, organisms adapt their biology to match cyclical fluctuations in the environment (e.g. light, food availability, predation) and thus respond optimally. In mammals, the circadian system consists of a network of tissue clocks housed across the body and coordinated by a central pacemaker located within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the anterior hypothalamus. Within all of these sites, the molecular clock machinery drives rhythmic transcriptional and metabolic pathways in a tissue-specific manner, a process critical to proper tissue function –. Altered circadian function, be it through genetic variation, lifestyle factors (e.g. chronic shift work, sleep restriction, nocturnal light exposure) or experimental perturbation (e.g. forced desynchrony) are linked to a wide range of pathogenic states from metabolic disease to cancer –. A further, more prevalent circadian insult occurs when the phase of our internal timing (chronotype) does not match with patterns of societal-driven activity (commonly referred to as social jet-lag). Indeed, large population and targeted cohort studies are now linking chronotype with a variety of health, psychiatric and life history variables –. Given that modern life has disturbed the natural temporal structure of our environment, it is critical that we understand the mechanisms which link clock desynchrony to pathophysiological outcomes.

In mammals, circadian timekeeping is centred on the feedback coupling of the transcriptional activators CLOCK and BMAL1, and repressors PERIOD, CRYPTOCHROME and REVERB. Much of our understanding of clock function has been defined through genetic ablation of these and additional constituent factors. Animal studies demonstrate that genetic disruption of individual core clock genes can have a severe impact on heath, ranging from disturbances in metabolism and inflammatory response, to altered bone formation and neurodegeneration. However, due to pleotropic and/or developmental activity of the targeted clock genes, it is rarely possible to isolate the influence of clock timing per se from that of the ablated factor. Moreover, in the context of human health, misalignment with the environment is overwhelmingly the principal source of circadian disruption, rather than the relatively minor contributions of genetic disruption in clock gene function.

### Sleep States alter activity of suprachiasmatic nucleus neurons [^115CQnL2]. Nature Neuroscience (2003). Medium credibility.

The timing of sleep and wakefulness in mammals is governed by a sleep homeostatic process and by the circadian clock of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which has a molecular basis for rhythm generation. By combining SCN electrical activity recordings with electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings in the same animal (the Wistar rat), we discovered that changes in vigilance states are paralleled by strong changes in SCN electrophysiological activity. During rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, neuronal activity in the SCN was elevated, and during non-REM (NREM) sleep, it was lowered. We also carried out selective sleep deprivation experiments to confirm that changes in SCN electrical activity are caused by changes in vigilance state. Our results indicate that the 24-hour pattern in electrical activity that is controlled by the molecular machinery of the SCN is substantially modified by afferent information from the central nervous system.

### Circadian pacemaking in cells and circuits of the suprachiasmatic nucleus [^116bgW1S]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2014). Low credibility.

Future prospects?

As noted above, the SCN and its circadian functions provide a remarkably clear and robust exemplar for the localisation of function in the central nervous system of mammals. Extending from the behaviour and properties of a few core genes, it is possible to explain circadian phenotypes at all levels of organisation: neurone, transcriptome, neural circuit, whole organism and ecological niche. Further developments in our understanding can be anticipated from the application of approaches similar to those considered in the present review. With growing resolution and certainty, it will be possible to demonstrate how defined neuronal populations control particular behaviours and neuroendocrine states: but what about developments beyond the SCN and the translational value of circadian knowledge? All biology pivots about the efficient use of energy, and the roles of SCN and local clocks in optimising metabolism by temporally integrating energy utilisation across the daily cycle of feeding and fasting is becoming clear. If obesity and diabetes arise not solely as a result of what is eaten, but also when it is consumed (as appears to be the case), then incorporation of the dimension of circadian time will provide important insights into the mechanisms and management of metabolic disease. The feeding/fasting cycle in turn is a product of the cycle of sleep and wakefulness: the most profound change in the neural state and again a product of the SCN. Moreover, it has now been demonstrated that reduced sleep is positively correlated with obesity. The ultimate pay-off of circadian biology, therefore, will be to unravel the neural mechanisms that effect this regular alternation in our very being and its impact upon physiology. By analogy with circadian integration in the periphery, it can be envisaged that local clocks throughout the brain co-ordinate local rhythms of gene and protein expression, ensuring that neurones produce factors necessary for the contrasting demands imposed on them by wakefulness (online sensory and motor computations) and sleep (recovery, growth and consolidation of information). These local clocks will, in turn, be entrained to each other and to solar time by the SCN. Temporal misalignment of these local clocks will compromise the global state of wakefulness or sleep, causing both to be less efficient. Cognitive defects and mood disturbances will ensue. Although in its infancy, the use of circadian approaches to increase our understanding of neuronal function and states of consciousness offers a direct pathway to identifying 'how the brain works'.

### Suprachiasmatic nucleus dysfunction induces anxiety-and depression-like behaviors via activating the BDNF-trkB pathway of the striatum [^113PfXSU]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The circadian system regulates physiological, cellular and behavioral rhythms that are about 24 h in duration. It is regulated by interlocking transcription-translation feedback loops (TTFL) controlled by clock genes, including transcriptional activators like Bmal1 and Clock, and repressors like Cry and Per. This rhythm consists of the master clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, as well as peripheral clocks in various brain regions and other organs. Accumulating evidence indicate that circadian disturbances might contribute to occurrence and progression of mood disorders, including anxiety and depression.

Anxiety and depression are frequently accompanied by symptoms associated with circadian rhythm disorders like difficulty falling asleep and early awakening, and can be attributed to abnormalities in circadian genes. Depression episodes manifest a cyclical pattern, with severe morning symptoms which subsides in the evening, accompanied by decreased circadian gene amplitudes. Circadian disruption heightens the risk of anxiety and depression by 25–40% and is a predictor of recurrence. While numerous studies strongly suggest that deleting certain circadian rhythm genes makes individuals more susceptible to anxiety and depression, the exact reason for this link remains unclear. This is especially true regarding the specific role of the SCN, the brain region responsible for regulating the body's internal clock.

The efferent fibers of SCN mainly project to the ventromedial preoptic area (VMPO) and ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO), thalamus, and limbic system, thus connecting with important brain areas related to mental emotions. The striatum (Str), a brain region involved in emotions, memory, and thinking, acts as an internal clock. This is particularly true for the ventral part of the striatum, which includes the mesolimbic pathway of ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the nucleus accumbens (NAc). These areas show a strong daily rhythm in their activity. In the striatum, the expression levels of BDNF-TrkB pathway exhibit a circadian rhythm, and contributes to the pathogenesis of anxiety and depression. Thus, we hypothesized that dysfunction in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which affects the circadian rhythm, can induce anxiety- and depression-like behaviors via the BDNF-TrkB pathway in the striatum.

### Reduced numbers of corticotropin-releasing hormone neurons in narcolepsy type 1 [^117XCt73]. Annals of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is a chronic sleep disorder correlated with loss of hypocretin(orexin). In NT1 post‐mortem brains, we observed 88% reduction in corticotropin‐releasing hormone (CRH)‐positive neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and significantly less CRH‐positive fibers in the median eminence, whereas CRH‐neurons in the locus coeruleus and thalamus, and other PVN neuronal populations were spared: that is, vasopressin, oxytocin, tyrosine hydroxylase, and thyrotropin releasing hormone‐expressing neurons. Other hypothalamic cell groups, that is, the suprachiasmatic, ventrolateral preoptic, infundibular, and supraoptic nuclei and nucleus basalis of Meynert, were unaffected. The surprising selective decrease in CRH‐neurons provide novel targets for diagnostics and therapeutic interventions. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:282–288

### Molecular interrogation of hypothalamic organization reveals distinct dopamine neuronal subtypes [^1178bAsb]. Nature Neuroscience (2017). Medium credibility.

The hypothalamus contains the highest diversity of neurons in the brain. Many of these neurons can co-release neurotransmitters and neuropeptides in a use-dependent manner. Investigators have hitherto relied on candidate protein-based tools to correlate behavioral, endocrine and gender traits with hypothalamic neuron identity. Here we map neuronal identities in the hypothalamus by single-cell RNA sequencing. We distinguished 62 neuronal subtypes producing glutamatergic, dopaminergic or GABAergic markers for synaptic neurotransmission and harboring the ability to engage in task-dependent neurotransmitter switching. We identified dopamine neurons that uniquely coexpress the Onecut3 and Nmur2 genes, and placed these in the periventricular nucleus with many synaptic afferents arising from neuromedin S + neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus. These neuroendocrine dopamine cells may contribute to the dopaminergic inhibition of prolactin secretion diurnally, as their neuromedin S + inputs originate from neurons expressing Per2 and Per3 and their tyrosine hydroxylase phosphorylation is regulated in a circadian fashion. Overall, our catalog of neuronal subclasses provides new understanding of hypothalamic organization and function.

### Selective changes in vasopressin neurons and astrocytes in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of Prader-Willi syndrome subjects [^116KGYJ6]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Prader–Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a genetic imprinting disorder, mainly caused by a lack of expression of genes of the paternally acquired 15q11‐q13 chromosome region.PWS symptomatology is, for the major part, of hypothalamic etiology and includes, for instance, morbid obesity, hypogonadism, impaired growth, abnormal body composition, and behavioral aberrancies.PWS subjects also experience deteriorated circadian rhythm outputs, mostly evident through sleep disturbances, concomitant to altered neuroendocrineand autonomic functions. To this date, the neuroanatomical basis, as well as pathophysiological mechanisms for these circadian disruptions reported in PWS remain unexplored.

The hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) constitutes the master circadian clock of the mammalian brain.SCN neurons control a multitude of physiological and behavioral daily rhythms, including neuroendocrine regulation, temperature fluctuations, and sleep–wake cycles. At the cellular level, SCN neurons generate rhythms through an autoregulatory feedback loop involving transcription factors that are termed clock genes. This ultimately translates into rhythms of gene expression with a period of approximately 24 h (i.e. circadian rhythms). The endogenously generated circadian rhythm of the SCN as a whole is synchronized to the exact 24 h rhythm of the environmental light–dark cycle by photic input from the retina via the retinohypothalamic tract. Moreover, emerging evidence shows that SCN astroglia are involved in the proper synchronization of circadian rhythms generated within the SCN. Several lines of evidence suggest that circadian disruption is a symptom of numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and depression. Numeric and functional alterations in the SCN circadian neural network have been reported in these pathologies, leading to defective generation of biological rhythms.

To investigate whether the circadian disruptions of PWS subjects are associated with aberrant biological rhythm generation by their SCN, we resorted to publicly available hypothalamic single‐cell RNA‐sequencing (scRNA‐seq) datasetsto investigate whether PWS‐causative genes are expressed in the SCN. Next, we profiled neural and glial markers in postmortem hypothalamic tissue of PWS subjects and controls.

Circadian timing system — Figure 2 indicates that light is the primary zeitgeber providing direct input to the central clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and indirect input to peripheral clocks via neurohormonal pathways, and that sleep-wake timing, feeding schedule, exercise, and social interaction are secondary nonphotic zeitgebers that affect central and peripheral clocks and light exposure; it states that internal and external misalignment contribute to an array of organ dysfunction.

### Sleep in neurodegenerative diseases: a focus on melatonin, melanin-concentrating hormone and orexin [^112SBKs2]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

Animal models are widely used in neurodegenerative research as surrogates for human disease. Multiple models are often employed for a single condition because no perfect model has yet been identified. The complexity of human pathologies, particularly in diseases like ALS or Alzheimer's, involves diverse genetic, cellular, and systemic factors that can only be partially modelled. Each animal model allows researchers to isolate and investigate a specific mechanism (e.g. protein aggregation, synaptic dysfunction) under controlled conditions. Furthermore, since these diseases often arise from different gene mutations leading to distinct symptom profiles, cross‐validating findings across various models helps identify therapeutic targets that are robust across multiple genetic contexts.

An interplay between circadian and homeostatic processes regulates sleep timing, propensity, and quality. Two different homeostatic processes regulate sleep depth and REM sleep duration. The homeostasis of NREM sleep is characterised by the high power of slow oscillations at the beginning of sleep, decreasing progressively until awakening. REM sleep duration is homeostatically regulated. The regulation of slow oscillations' power interacts with the circadian rhythm to generate a regenerative and robust period of sleep. It regulates wake and sleep timing and duration. Complex neuronal networks are involved in the generation of the sleep–wake cycle. They include the orexin/hypocretin neurons, aminergic and cholinergic neurons for inducing wakefulness, the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus for inducing NREM sleep, and brainstem and hypothalamic neurons like the melanin‐concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons to induce REM.

The circadian timing system (CTS) is driven in mammals by a central pacemaker located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), which oscillates with a near‐24‐h period and is synchronised to the 24‐h day by external cues such as light, food intake, and social interactions. The SCN regulates peripheral molecular clocks in all nucleated cells through rhythmic signals like hormone fluctuations and temperature cycles.

Each molecular clock, composed of 15 major genes operating in feedback loops, generates a circadian rhythm that coordinates feeding, fasting, anabolism (nutrient storage during wakefulness), and catabolism (glycogenolysis and lipolysis during sleep).

Sleep is strongly modified across the lifespan, occupying most of the time at birth and progressively decreasing during childhood before stabilising in adults and declining again during ageing. Alterations in sleep can have far‐reaching consequences for cognitive function, emotional regulation, and physical health in older adults. Furthermore, the ageing process itself is a major risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative diseases.

### An endocrinologist's guide to the clock [^116UHxnU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Context

It has long been recognized that a "biological clock" residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus controls circadian or daily variations in physiological processes. Old observations are now being revisited after the discovery of the cellular mechanism of timekeeping, the molecular clock, an autoregulatory feedback loop of transcription factors that cycles over a period of approximately 24 h. Its functioning or breakdown impinges upon the physiology and pathophysiology of numerous systems, including the endocrine system and metabolism. Here we provide an introduction to those aspects of the clock most relevant to the endocrinologist.

Evidence Acquisition

Articles were identified by searching PubMed using the search terms "circadian" and "clock" and refining results to include articles relating to endocrinology and metabolism.

Evidence Synthesis

We discuss current understanding of the mechanisms through which hormonal and metabolic axes fall under the influence of the circadian clock. Of particular interest is the complex interaction of genetic and environmental factors in determining health or disease states.

Conclusions

Research into the molecular clock provides a novel window onto endocrine and metabolic disease. These advances present new avenues for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

### Timing to perfection: the biology of central and peripheral circadian clocks [^112PNbDB]. Neuron (2012). Low credibility.

The mammalian circadian system, which is comprised of multiple cellular clocks located in the organs and tissues, orchestrates their regulation in a hierarchical manner throughout the 24 hr of the day. At the top of the hierarchy are the suprachiasmatic nuclei, which synchronize subordinate organ and tissue clocks using electrical, endocrine, and metabolic signaling pathways that impact the molecular mechanisms of cellular clocks. The interplay between the central neural and peripheral tissue clocks is not fully understood and remains a major challenge in determining how neurological and metabolic homeostasis is achieved across the sleep-wake cycle. Disturbances in the communication between the plethora of body clocks can desynchronize the circadian system, which is believed to contribute to the development of diseases such as obesity and neuropsychiatric disorders. This review will highlight the relationship between clocks and metabolism, and describe how cues such as light, food, and reward mediate entrainment of the circadian system.

### A neural circuit for circadian regulation of arousal [^113yNQhH]. Nature Neuroscience (2001). Medium credibility.

An unknown aspect of behavioral state regulation is how the circadian oscillator of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) regulates sleep and waking. In this report, we describe the necessary elements for a circuit that provides circadian regulation of arousal. Trans-synaptic retrograde tracing revealed a prominent indirect projection from the SCN to the noradrenergic nucleus locus coeruleus (LC), a brain arousal system. Double-labeling experiments revealed several possible links between the SCN and the LC, including the dorsomedial (DMH) and paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei (PVN), as well as medial and ventrolateral pre-optic areas. Lesion studies confirmed that the DMH is a substantial relay in this circuit. Next, neurophysiology experiments revealed circadian variations in LC impulse activity. Lesions of the DMH eliminated these circadian changes in LC activity, confirming the functionality of the SCN-DMH-LC circuit. These results reveal mechanisms for regulation of circadian and sleep-waking functions.

### Circadian VIPergic neurons of the suprachiasmatic nuclei sculpt the sleep-wake cycle [^112dj3po]. Neuron (2020). Medium credibility.

Although the mammalian rest-activity cycle is controlled by a "master clock" in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, it is unclear how firing of individual SCN neurons gates individual features of daily activity. Here, we demonstrate that a specific transcriptomically identified population of mouse VIP+ SCN neurons is active at the "wrong" time of day-nighttime-when most SCN neurons are silent. Using chemogenetic and optogenetic strategies, we show that these neurons and their cellular clocks are necessary and sufficient to gate and time nighttime sleep but have no effect upon daytime sleep. We propose that mouse nighttime sleep, analogous to the human siesta, is a "hard-wired" property gated by specific neurons of the master clock to favor subsequent alertness prior to dawn (a circadian "wake maintenance zone"). Thus, the SCN is not simply a 24-h metronome: specific populations sculpt critical features of the sleep-wake cycle.

### Nighttime-specific differential gene expression in suprachiasmatic nucleus and habenula is associated with resilience to chronic social stress [^113J5QFu]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Mood disorders are complex heterogeneous disorders that affect cognition, emotional processing and basic physiological functioning. There is growing evidence of a tight connection between circadian rhythms and mood regulation. A majority of depressed patients show more severe symptoms in the morning than in the evening. Diurnal processes including diurnal rhythms in secretion of growth hormones and melatonin, daily core body temperature, and sleep/wake cycles are disrupted in some depressed patients. These internal rhythmic processes are maintained on a 24-h cycle by multiple peripheral clocks throughout the body which are synchronised to a single central principal clock in the mammalian hypothalamus — the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN itself has been shown to affect depressive and anxious-like responses in mice. Furthermore, the SCN projects to several hypothalamic structures that regulate diurnal processes disrupted in depression, including the paraventricular nucleus, subparaventricular zone, and dorsomedial hypothalamus. Overall, direct and indirect SCN projections to mood-regulating brain areas are likely responsible for the diurnal rhythmicity of symptoms observed in depressed patients.

One such mood-regulating brain area that is thought to receive inputs from the SCN is the habenular complex (Hb), which is composed predominantly of lateral (LHb) and medial habenula (MHb) subregions. The Hb relays information between the forebrain emotion-processing limbic system and the midbrain depression-associated aminergic centres. The Hb is heavily involved in mediating stress responses and has also been associated with circadian modulation of depression. Elevated diurnal firing in LHb neurons projecting to the serotonergic dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) is associated with social avoidance in chronically stressed mice, while passive coping, a behaviour mirroring apathy and resignation in humans, has been associated with increased activity in numerous circuits, including: LHb-DRN projections, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) projections to LHb, and LHb projections to the ventral tegmental area (VTA). The pharmacological inhibition of the LHb rescues depressive-like behaviour. In contrast, MHb lesion impairs voluntary exercise and induces despair-like and anhedonic behavioural phenotypes in mice, without affecting the circadian period and sleep architecture. Despite the apparent importance of Hb in mood regulation, the effects of stress on molecular pathways in the Hb remain underexplored.

### Circadian rhythm sleep disorders [^114jKvgw]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Humans exhibit endogenous circadian rhythms that are regulated by the master circadian clock of the body, the suprachiasmatic nucleus. These endogenous circadian rhythms are aligned to the outside world by social and environmental cues. Circadian rhythm sleep disorders (CRSD) occur when there is an alteration of the internal timing mechanism or a misalignment between sleep and the 24-h social and physical environment. CRSD are often underrecognized yet should be considered in the differential of patients presenting with symptoms of insomnia and/or hypersomnia. Because behavioral and environmental factors often are involved in the development and maintenance of these conditions, a multimodal treatment approach of behavioral and/or pharmacologic approaches is usually required to synchronize a patient's circadian rhythm to the 24-h environment, consolidate sleep, and improve alertness. Rapid advances in our understanding of the physiologic, cellular, and molecular basis of circadian rhythm and sleep regulation will likely lead to improved diagnostic tools and treatments for CRSD.

Introduction to the Circadian Clock

Life has evolved under a 24-h rhythm where environmental factors such as temperature and light fluctuate with a daily predictable sequence. As a consequence, most organisms have evolved circadian clocks that anticipate these regular environmental changes and establish endogenous 24-h rhythms to get the correct physiology and behaviour to the appropriate time window each day. The mechanisms underlying circadian regulation are cell autonomous transcription-translation feedback loops (TTFLs): In mammals, the transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1 drive the expression of Period (Per1/2) and Cryptochrome (Cry1/2), whose protein products in turn feed-back to inhibit CLOCK and BMAL1 (Fig. 1). Downstream of these four factors lie thousands of clock-controlled genes that orchestrate the oscillation of tissue-specific metabolic and physiological functions. Most cells in the body possess a molecular clock and are maintained in synchrony by a master pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus.

### How the skin can tell time [^113JZqNT]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

The mammalian central circadian pacemaker, which is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, synchronizes and entrains clocks found in peripheral tissues. Skin harbors an active circadian clock that is under the influence of the central clock. This clock, which probably operates in most-perhaps all-types of skin cells, may influence the regulation of several circadian physiological phenomena, including cell proliferation.

### Alterations of melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus during depression [^1151eqoP]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The pineal hormone melatonin regulates circadian rhythms, largely by feedback on the central biological clock of the brain, the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). This feedback is mediated by the melatonin receptors, melatonin receptor 1 (MT1) and melatonin receptor 2 (MT2). The circadian system may play a role in the pathophysiology of mood disorders, and indeed, melatonin-receptor agonists are considered a potential therapy for depression.

Method

In order to investigate melatonin receptors in the SCN during depression, and their relationship to the major neuropeptides in the SCN, vasopressin (AVP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), we studied the SCN in 14 depressed patients (five major depression and nine bipolar disorder) and 14 matched controls by immunocytochemistry.

Results

We show here that hypothalamic MT2 receptor immunoreactivity was limited to SCN, the supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus. We found that numbers of MT1-immunoreactive (MT1-ir) cells and AVP and/or VIP-ir cells were increased in the central SCN in depression, but numbers of MT2-ir cells were not altered. Moreover, the number of MT1-ir cells, but not MT2-ir cells was negatively correlated with age at onset of depression, while positively correlated with disease duration. CONCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS: Although every post-mortem study has limitations, MT1 receptors appeared specifically increased in the SCN of depressed patients, and may increase during the course of the disease. These changes may be involved in the circadian disorders and contribute to the efficacy of MT agonists or melatonin in depression. Moreover, we suggest that melatonin receptor agonists for depression should be targeted towards the MT1 receptor selectively.

### Suprachiasmatic nucleus dysfunction induces anxiety-and depression-like behaviors via activating the BDNF-trkB pathway of the striatum [^111sMx7j]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

The circadian rhythm system consists of a master clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus and peripheral clocks dispersed throughout other brain areas (including striatum, Str) as well as various tissues and organs. Circadian rhythm disturbance is a major risk factor and common comorbidity for mood disorders, especially anxiety and depression. Bmal1 is one of the fundamental clock protein genes that is required to maintain circadian rhythm. Recent research has revealed a link between suprachiasmatic nucleus dysfunction and anxiety and depression, but the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. This study aimed to investigate how circadian rhythm disturbance may lead to anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. Through behavioral tests, virus tracing, molecular biology and other techniques, we found neural connection from the suprachiasmatic nucleus to the striatum. SCN lesions and Bmal1 flox/flox +pAAV-hSyn-Cre-GFP (conditional knockout, cKO) mice exhibited disruptions in core body temperature rhythm, as well as anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. Importantly, these mice displayed altered expression patterns of clock protein genes and an upregulation of the Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) - Tyrosine Kinase receptor B (TrkB) signaling pathway within the striatum. Microinjection of the TrkB inhibitor ANA-12 can effectively reverse anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. These findings indicate that suprachiasmatic nucleus dysfunction may contribute to the pathogenesis of anxiety and depression through upregulation of the BDNF-TrkB pathway in the striatum, potentially mediated by neural projections from the SCN. Bmal1 gene within SCN may represent a novel therapeutic target for mood disorders.

### The suprachiasmatic nucleus, circadian clocks, and the liver [^117VrCk4]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

Liver glucose metabolism and diurnal rhythms

It is now accepted that dissociation of behavioral patterns from environmental rhythms may lead to obesity and type 2 diabetes, as well as cardiovascular sequelae. It is interesting to consider some changes in diurnal rhythms that have been noted in diabetes. Nondiabetic individuals and some mouse models, whether lean or overweight, maintain a constant fasting glycemia over a diurnal cycle, although drifting downward with extended fasting. Compared with BMI- and age-matched individuals, subjects with type 2 diabetes who were fasting demonstrated a cyclic pattern of glycemia over a 24-h period. Lowest glucose levels were observed in the evening and they increased throughout the night to reach highest levels at ∼7:00Tracer-determined estimates of flux rates showed that the diurnal changes in glycemia that occurred were driven by changes in glucose production, specifically gluconeogenesis. This could be explained by the following:

Disruptions in the SCN central clock. This would be supported by the large delay and decrease in melatonin secretion observed.
Melatonin itself possibly affecting glucose metabolism. This is further supported by genome-wide association studies implicating a melatonin receptor in hepatic insulin resistance, impaired insulin secretion, and increased type 2 diabetes risk.
Transition to an oscillatory behavior of metabolic systems when appropriate changes occur in rate constants describing these systems. Such biochemically induced oscillations could be considered as similar to those generated by cellular clock mechanisms.

Because, in diabetes, it is the putative disruptions in the SCN, the biological clock, or melatonin secretion that were coupled with the appearance of new cyclic behavior, the third hypothesis became more likely. The implications of this proposition would be that cycles or oscillations can be generated at the metabolic level, and that these could be imposed on the central biological clock, which is modifiable (as discussed). There is previous evidence that alterations in metabolism could affect such changes. It is also interesting that the liver may have a dominant role in entraining the expression of many peripheral clock genes, overriding central influences. Such a relationship would complete the reciprocal influences of the SCN and its targeted metabolic pathways shown in Fig. 1. Moreover, it could be mediated through changes in peripheral clock proteins. Its importance would be reflected in the direct association with disease etiology.

### Circadian VIPergic neurons of the suprachiasmatic nuclei sculpt the sleep-wake cycle [^115A8tpy]. Neuron (2020). Medium credibility.

It has been suggested that a siesta occurs because of rising sleep pressure after prolonged periods of wake. Even though a siesta is nonessential and genetically variable in mice, Drosophila), and humans, our results suggest its specific utility: to maintain alertness at the end of the activity period. Across species, a period of increased activity anticipating dark:light transitions could be useful both metabolically as a last opportunity to forage before sleeping and to avoid risk of crepuscular predation. A programmed daily siesta could also aid entrainment to changing seasonal conditions by providing a mechanism by which an organism extends its active period; indeed, in rats, napping is highly dependent upon photoperiod, with longer nights creating more pronounced naps. In humans, a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying our own well-documented mid-afternoon fatigue and early evening WMZ could provide an important intervention point to improve sleep consolidation.

### Suprachiasmatic VIP neurons are required for normal circadian rhythmicity and comprised of molecularly distinct subpopulations [^1176xn51]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

SCN VIP neurons and the circadian rhythm of sleep-wake

The SCN plays an important role in regulating the timing and architecture of the sleep-wake cycle. Additional data suggest a possible role for the SCN in regulating the amount of sleep and wake, although this remains a point of controversy. A decrease in rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep has also been reported in VIP −/− mice, although whether or not these effects on REM sleep in the VIP −/− mice link to SCN VIP or extra-SCN VIP regulation of REM sleep remains unclear. Regardless, the cellular and synaptic bases by which the SCN clock, including possibly SCN VIP neurons, might regulate the sleep-wake cycle remains to be determined. Given our foregoing findings, we asked whether SCN VIP neurons, or the molecular clock thereof, might contribute to the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle. We did so by recording the electroencephalogram (EEG) to monitor wake, REM and non-REM (NREM) sleep, in the same cohorts of mice as used for the Tb and LMA recordings, while mice were under DD. We found that NREM sleep was increased at the beginning of the subjective day in homozygous Bmal1 -deleted mice as compared to mice with partial Bmal1 deletions. And while we did not observe an effect of genotype on the quantity of each vigilance state, as measured over the 24 h period (Fig. 2a), we did find that Bmal1 -deleted mice exhibited decreased NREM sleep during the subjective light phase, leading to an apparent redistribution of sleep-wake activity (as demonstrated by a subjective dark to subjective light ratio (SD/SL) that is closer to 1 (Fig. 2 B2), suggesting a potential role for SCN VIP neurons in regulating the amplitude of the sleep-wake cycle. In order to test if disruption of the molecular clock in SCN VIP neurons affected sleep quality, we examined the vigilance state episodes during the SD and SL periods, as well as performed an analysis of the cortical EEG spectral power. Aside from sporadic individual differences in wakefulness episode duration, Bmal1 -deleted mice did not demonstrate differences in sleep fragmentation or consolidation as compared to mice with partial Bmal1 deletions (Fig. S5). Similarly, cortical EEG power distribution across the 24 h day revealed only a few significant differences, e.g. decreased delta power during NREM sleep at one isolated time point, in frequency bands between groups (Fig. S6).

### Circadian VIPergic neurons of the suprachiasmatic nuclei sculpt the sleep-wake cycle [^112dKzsw]. Neuron (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Almost all organisms have internal circadian clocks that consolidate sleep to night in diurnal organisms or day in nocturnal ones. Sleep duration and intensity are additionally regulated by a homeostatic mechanism dependent upon prior waking experience. Within this two-process model, it remains unclear to what extent the circadian clock acts as a "metronome" — indicating day and night — versus acting as an "orchestral conductor" — specifically shaping features of the sleep-wake cycle. Most animal species and all human cultures consolidate the majority of sleep to either day or night. Many also exhibit an additional period of sleep — a "siesta" — during the second half of the wake phase, followed by a period of increased alertness — the "wake maintenance zone" (WMZ) — thought to depend on sleep pressure. How the mammalian circadian oscillator shapes this complex pattern is unknown.

### Circadian neurons in the paraventricular nucleus entrain and sustain daily rhythms in glucocorticoids [^1119G1og]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Normal behavior and physiology depend on the circadian, or near-24 h, the release of hormones at the optimal time of day. Disruption of these rhythms due to disease or lifestyle is associated with numerous pathologies including affective and metabolic disorders. Understanding the neural circuits regulating the daily pattern of hormone production is, therefore, a central problem in neuroscience. The daily timing of hormone release is controlled by a central circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). SCN neurons contain a daily transcriptional-translational negative feedback loop consisting of core clock genes and proteins (e.g. Per1 /2, Cry1/2, Bmal1, Clock) and exhibit daily rhythms in neuronal activity that communicate circadian time to the rest of the brain and body. The SCN is necessary for daily rhythms in hormone production, as each of these rhythms are lost after SCN ablation –. SCN transplants can restore locomotor, but not endocrine, rhythms, indicating that synaptic connections from the SCN are required for daily rhythms in hormone release. However, fundamentally, we do not know how the SCN regulates daily rhythms in different hormones that each peak at different times of the day. For instance, while melatonin peaks at night in all vertebrates, glucocorticoids peak just prior to waking in both diurnal and nocturnal species. Consequently, it is important to investigate how signals from the SCN are decoded to generate circadian rhythms in hormone release.

The release of glucocorticoids, including cortisol in humans and corticosterone in rodents, is one of the highest amplitude circadian outputs and thus provides an excellent model system to understand the daily regulation of hormone release. Glucocorticoids are released each day just prior to waking to prepare the brain and body for physical and cognitive activity and their rhythmic release is essential for human health –. Normal cortisol rhythms are disrupted in Cushing's syndrome, in Addison's disease, in most patients undergoing glucocorticoid therapy, in patients with chronic stress or post-traumatic stress disorder, and in patients with anxiety or depression, which results in numerous physiological and psychiatric symptoms –. Similarly, cortisol rhythms and sleep schedules can become misaligned in shift workers and in social jet lag, which contributes to an increased incidence of disease –. Despite its clear importance to cognitive and mental health, the mechanisms underlying the circadian release of glucocorticoids are unclear.

### Discrete photoentrainment of mammalian central clock is regulated by bi-stable dynamic network in the suprachiasmatic nucleus [^114xeThw]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Our findings suggest an unconventional information flow in the SCN to process ambient light information. The traditional circuit was described as a simple linear circuit from the RHT to the VIP and GRP neurons-enriched ventrolateral "core", and then to the AVP neurons-enriched dorsomedial "shell" region. In this classic view, the PRC should be driven by a specific subset of neurons in SCN that are constantly responsive to light input. In other words, a certain subset of neurons in the SCN would show consistent light responses in all three circadian time zones. However, our findings show that distinct neuron groups are responsive to light at different circadian time zones respectively. Combined with recent anatomical studies showing dense ipRGC axonal fibers in the SCN –, our results indicate that a complex network structure including many feedback circuits in SCN may better describe circadian photoentrainment than the conventional simple hierarchical model.

### Discrete photoentrainment of mammalian central clock is regulated by bi-stable dynamic network in the suprachiasmatic nucleus [^115P6HzK]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The biological clock synchronizes with the environmental light-dark cycle through circadian photoentrainment. While intracellular pathways regulating clock gene expression after light exposure in the suprachiasmatic nucleus are well studied in mammals, the neuronal circuits driving phase shifts remain unclear. Here, using a mouse model, we show that chemogenetic activation of early-night light-responsive neurons induces phase delays at any circadian time, potentially breaking the photoentrainment dead zone. In contrast, activating late-night light-responsive neurons mimics light-induced phase shifts. Using in vivo two-photon microscopy, we found that most neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus exhibit stochastic light responses, while a small subset is consistently activated in the early subjective night and another is inhibited in the late subjective night. Our findings suggest a dynamic bi-stable network model for circadian photoentrainment, where phase shifts arise from a functional circuit integrating signals to groups of outcome neurons, rather than a labeled-line principle seen in sensory systems.

### Circadian timing of metabolism in animal models and humans [^1172wgK6]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Most living beings, including humans, must adapt to rhythmically occurring daily changes in their environment that are generated by the Earth's rotation. In the course of evolution, these organisms have acquired an internal circadian timing system that can anticipate environmental oscillations and thereby govern their rhythmic physiology in a proactive manner. In mammals, the circadian timing system coordinates virtually all physiological processes encompassing vigilance states, metabolism, endocrine functions and cardiovascular activity. Research performed during the past two decades has established that almost every cell in the body possesses its own circadian timekeeper. The resulting clock network is organized in a hierarchical manner. A master pacemaker, located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, is synchronized every day to the photoperiod. In turn, the SCN determines the phase of the cellular clocks in peripheral organs through a wide variety of signalling pathways dependent on feeding cycles, body temperature rhythms, oscillating bloodborne signals and, in some organs, inputs of the peripheral nervous system. A major purpose of circadian clocks in peripheral tissues is the temporal orchestration of key metabolic processes, including food processing (metabolism and xenobiotic detoxification). Here, we review some recent findings regarding the molecular and cellular composition of the circadian timing system and discuss its implications for the temporal coordination of metabolism in health and disease. We focus primarily on metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, although circadian misalignments (shiftwork or 'social jet lag') have also been associated with the aetiology of human malignancies.

The Core Mechanism of Circadian Rhythm

Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN) — The Master Circadian Clock

The circadian rhythm is closely related to human daily life, with the most prevalent physiological activity being the alignment of waking at sunrise and resting at sunset. This cyclical behavioral pattern has evolved over millennia in humans. In mammals, the central circadian pacemaker is located in the SCN. The Earth's rotation generates a 24-hour cycle of light and darkness, with this photic information being relayed along the retinohypothalamic tract to the SCN. Subsequently, the SCN modulates clock gene expression across various tissues and organs through intricate feedback loops, ensuring that internal circadian rhythms align with external temporal changes (Figure 1). When it comes to circadian rhythm, the core revolves around clock genes, including Per, Cry, Bmal1, Clock, Npas2, and Rev-erbα, which exist in every cell of all mammals. The rhythmic output signals of SCN can precisely regulate the biological clocks in peripheral tissues, allowing them to carry out corresponding physiological activities within appropriate timeframes.

Figure 1
The Core Mechanism of Circadian Rhythm.

The Choroid Plexus Is an Important Circadian Clock Component

The choroid plexus (ChP) is a key brain structure that produces cerebrospinal fluid, maintains the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, regulates brain homeostasis and circadian rhythms, and is located in the four ventricles of the brain. Jihwan Myung et al found in mice that the ChP can independently regulate rhythms and transmit signals to SCN through cerebrospinal fluid, shortening its rhythm cycle to a near behavioral rhythm. Moreover, the clock genes such as Bmal1and Per2 exhibit stronger amplitudes, greater intensities, and shorter oscillation periods in ChP than those in SCN.

Peripheral Clocks

Peripheral clocks are the biological clocks present in peripheral tissues, which together with the central clock (SCN) constitute the complete circadian system. Although peripheral clocks are mainly regulated by the SCN, they still possess autonomous circadian rhythms. Studies have found that SCN lesions reduce the overall rhythmic amplitude without eliminating basal oscillations in the liver. Therefore, the rhythms of some important peripheral organs may tick independently of their master.

### Fasting differentially alters the hypothalamic proteome of chickens from lines with the propensity to be anorexic or obese [^113Frexg]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The hypothalamus plays a crucial role in appetite regulation by integrating, coordinating, and transferring multiple nutrient-related signals from both peripheral and central nervous systems. The arcuate nucleus (ARC), ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, dorsomedial nucleus, paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, suprachiasmatic nucleus, and lateral hypothalamus constitute the "core" of the appetite regulatory network in the hypothalamus. Previous studies have shown that fasting induces changes in glucose and lipid metabolism and gene expression of appetite regulatory peptides in the mammalian hypothalamus –. However, relevant regulatory mechanisms involved in the response to fasting in the hypothalamus are complex and remain unclear, especially in non-mammalian species.

Proteomic studies can reveal the complex and dynamic biological processes that operate during development and growth, as well as aid in determining environmental effects. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics techniques facilitate the characterization of the protein profile of a sample, via qualitative and quantitative measurements, and assessments of posttranslational modifications and interaction of proteins. To date, proteomics has been applied in chickens principally by studies involving embryos, muscle, adipose tissue, liver, spleen, egg and bursa of Fabricius –.

### Circadian-independent light regulation of mammalian metabolism [^117LbtYH]. Nature Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

The daily light-dark cycle is a key zeitgeber (time cue) for entraining an organism's biological clock, whereby light sensing by retinal photoreceptors, particularly intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells, stimulates the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, a central pacemaker that in turn orchestrates the rhythm of peripheral metabolic activities. Non-rhythmic effects of light on metabolism have also been long known, and their transduction mechanisms are only beginning to unfold. Here, we summarize emerging evidence that, in mammals, light exposure or deprivation profoundly affects glucose homeostasis, thermogenesis and other metabolic activities in a clock-independent manner. Such light regulation could involve melanopsin-based, intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cell-initiated brain circuits via the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus and other nuclei, or direct stimulation of opsins expressed in the hypothalamus, adipose tissue, blood vessels and skin to regulate sympathetic tone, lipolysis, glucose uptake, mitochondrial activation, thermogenesis, food intake, blood pressure and melanogenesis. These photic signalling events may coordinate with circadian-based mechanisms to maintain metabolic homeostasis, with dysregulation of this system underlying metabolic diseases caused by aberrant light exposure, such as environmental night light and shift work.

### Schizophrenia and disruption of circadian rhythms: an overview of genetic, metabolic and clinical signs [^112rbKyB]. Schizophrenia Research (2024). Medium credibility.

A molecular clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus, which is entrained by the dark-light cycle and controls the sleep-wake cycle, regulates circadian rhythms. The risk of developing mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, has long been linked to sleep abnormalities. Additionally, a common aspect of mental disorders is sleep disturbance, which has a direct impact on the intensity of the symptoms and the quality of life of the patient. This relationship can be explained by gene alterations such as CLOCK in schizophrenia which are also important components of the physiological circadian rhythm. The function of dopamine and adenosine in circadian rhythm should also be noted, as these hypotheses are considered to be the most popular theories explaining schizophrenia pathogenesis. Therefore, determining the presence of a causal link between the two can be key to identifying new potential targets in schizophrenia therapy, which can open new avenues for clinical research as well as psychiatric care. We review circadian disruption in schizophrenia at the genetic, metabolic, and clinical levels. We summarize data about clock and clock-controlled genes' alterations, neurotransmitter systems' impairments, and association with chronotype in schizophrenia patients. Our findings demonstrate that in schizophrenia either homeostatic or circadian processes of sleep regulation are disturbed. Also, we found an insufficient number of studies aimed at studying the relationship between known biological phenomena of circadian disorders and clinical signs of schizophrenia.

### Circadian pacemaking in cells and circuits of the suprachiasmatic nucleus [^112stnR4]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2014). Low credibility.

The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus is the principal circadian pacemaker of the brain. It co-ordinates the daily rhythms of sleep and wakefulness, as well as physiology and behaviour, that set the tempo to our lives. Disturbance of this daily pattern, most acutely with jet-lag but more insidiously with rotational shift-work, can have severely deleterious effects for mental function and long-term health. The present review considers recent developments in our understanding of the properties of the SCN that make it a robust circadian time-keeper. It first focuses on the intracellular transcriptional/ translational feedback loops (TTFL) that constitute the cellular clockwork of the SCN neurone. Daily timing by these loops pivots around the negative regulation of the Period (Per) and Cryptochrome (Cry) genes by their protein products. The period of the circadian cycle is set by the relative stability of Per and Cry proteins, and this can be controlled by both genetic and pharmacological interventions. It then considers the function of these feedback loops in the context of cytosolic signalling by cAMP and intracellular calcium ([Ca 2+] i), which are both outputs from, and inputs to, the TTFL, as well as the critical role of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) signalling in synchronising cellular clocks across the SCN. Synchronisation by VIP in the SCN is paracrine, operating over an unconventionally long time frame (i.e. 24 h) and wide spatial domain, mediated via the cytosolic pathways upstream of the TTFL. Finally, we show how intersectional pharmacogenetics can be used to control G-protein-coupled signalling in individual SCN neurones, and how manipulation of Gq/[Ca 2+] i -signalling in VIP neurones can re-programme the circuit-level encoding of circadian time. Circadian pacemaking in the SCN therefore provides an unrivalled context in which to understand how a complex, adaptive behaviour can be organised by the dynamic activity of a relatively few gene products, operating in a clearly defined neuronal circuit, with both cell-autonomous and emergent, circuit-level properties.

### Circadian clock dysfunction in Parkinson's disease: mechanisms, consequences, and therapeutic strategy [^114n3DH8]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

The circadian clock and its link to PD: is time relevant?

The circadian clock is an internal timekeeping system that orchestrates the daily rhythms of physiological processes in nearly all living organisms. In mammals, this clock is regulated by a central pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, which is synchronized via environmental timing cues, known as "Zeitgebers", the strongest being light for humans (see Box 2). The light is detected by a specialized set of neurons named intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) which are then transmitted to the SCN via the retinohypothalamic tract (see Box 2). The SCN, in turn, coordinates the body's peripheral oscillators — found in virtually all tissues and cells — through intricate networks of neuronal and hormonal signals, ensuring synchronization of various physiological processes across the body. The circadian clock not only governs regulation of sleep-wake cycles, but also influences metabolism, hormone release, and even gene expression. Disruptions to this finely tuned system have been linked to various health disorders, including metabolic diseases, mood disorders, and neurodegenerative conditions like PD, underscoring the critical role of circadian rhythms in maintaining overall health.

### Circadian clocks: setting time by food [^114dDrwE]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2007). Low credibility.

In mammals, daily rhythms in behaviour and physiology are driven by a circadian timing system comprised, in a hierarchical way, of a master pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus and of peripheral oscillators in most body cells. At the molecular level, in both the SCN and peripheral oscillators, the circadian clock mechanism is built from interconnected feedback loops in gene expression that operate in a cell-autonomous and self-sustained fashion. The SCN clock is mainly entrained by light/dark cycles. By contrast, peripheral oscillators can be strongly affected by daily feeding cycles, which have little effect on the phase of the SCN. However, when feeding schedules are coupled with a caloric restriction, behavioural and physiological circadian rhythms and gene expression in the SCN are shifted and/or entrained to meal-time. Moreover, the reward and motivational value of food can also be a potent synchroniser for the SCN clock. This suggests that energy metabolism and motivational properties of food can influence the clock mechanism of the SCN. Food-related cues may entrain clock genes of the SCN with a direct effect, or be mediated indirectly by another neural or peripheral site. In addition, there may be one or more oscillator sites that would play an integral role as a food-entrained oscillator (FEO), responsible for anticipation of meal-time. The site housing, or the network underlying, this putative FEO is still unknown. The aim of this review is to summarise our current knowledge of the central and peripheral circadian clocks and how they can be entrained by feeding at the physiological and molecular levels.

3 Results

3.1 Neuroanatomical and neurophysiological studies identify dopaminergic neuronal projections from the SuMN to dopamine D2 receptor site regions within the peri‐SCN/SCN area

Our previous studies suggested a role for circadian responsiveness to systemic‐DOPA administration in the regulation of seasonal metabolism. 7, 8, 9, 10 Other studies centred on clock region neurophysiology identified a potential cause‐effect relationship between a diminution of the circadian peak in dopamine release at the general peri‐SCN region and seasonal glucose intolerance. 5, 6 However, the identification of specific dopaminergic neurones projecting to a peri‐SCN/SCN neural circuit that in turn regulates peripheral metabolism has not been established. Therefore, our initial studies into a potential role of peri‐SCN/SCN circadian dopaminergic regulation of HFD‐induced insulin resistance focused on identifying the anatomy of dopaminergic neurones within the peri‐SCN region, thereby aiming to investigate a role for their circadian neurophysiology in the regulation of SCN activity and peripheral metabolism.

### Astrocytes control circadian timekeeping in the suprachiasmatic nucleus via glutamatergic signaling [^111DGJcX]. Neuron (2017). Low credibility.

The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus orchestrates daily rhythms of physiology and behavior in mammals. Its circadian (∼24 hr) oscillations of gene expression and electrical activity are generated intrinsically and can persist indefinitely in temporal isolation. This robust and resilient timekeeping is generally regarded as a product of the intrinsic connectivity of its neurons. Here we show that neurons constitute only one "half" of the SCN clock, the one metabolically active during circadian daytime. In contrast, SCN astrocytes are active during circadian nighttime, when they suppress the activity of SCN neurons by regulating extracellular glutamate levels. This glutamatergic gliotransmission is sensed by neurons of the dorsal SCN via specific pre-synaptic NMDA receptor assemblies containing NR2C subunits. Remarkably, somatic genetic re-programming of intracellular clocks in SCN astrocytes was capable of remodeling circadian behavioral rhythms in adult mice. Thus, SCN circuit-level timekeeping arises from interdependent and mutually supportive astrocytic-neuronal signaling.

INTRODUCTION

Biological processes exhibit daily rhythms that enable organisms to coordinate their physiological activities with changes in demand over a day. In mammals, these rhythms exhibit a periodicity of about 24 h and are endogenously generated by the master circadian pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the anterior hypothalamus. These rhythms are synchronized by regularly recurring environmental cues or "Zeitgebers". Circadian biological clocks are entrained to a 24 h day/night cycle through the influence of light, the main Zeitgeber. Light is transduced into a neural signal by the retina and conveyed to the core of the SCN, which responds to light/dark cycles and co-ordinates circadian function, including locomotor activity, hormone secretion, body temperature maintenance, and feeding. The molecular and cellular basis of circadian rhythmicity consists of a complex interaction between specialized transcription factors, commonly described as the clock pathway, which represents an internal timekeeping system that interacts with these Zeitgebers. The generation and modulation of circadian rhythms rely on interconnected, self-sustained transcriptional/translational feedback loops, which result in the activation or repression of gene expression.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent form of dementia and one of the most devastating psychiatric disorders and is characterized by the accumulation of extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau, neuronal loss, and neuroinflammation. As well as severe cognitive deficits, patients with AD exhibit profound disruptions to their circadian rhythms in sleep–wakefulness and other processes. In recent years, increasing efforts have been made to better understand the molecular and cellular basis of the sleep disturbances and disrupted circadian rhythms observed frequently in AD patients. The clock pathway is crucially involved in the maintenance of such rhythmicity, and studies linking this molecular family to brain and body processes in AD patients can further elucidate the etiopathogenesis of this common dementia. Therefore, the investigation of the interactions of Aβ and NFTs with the clock gene pathway represents an interesting challenge for researchers.

### 'The clocks that time us' – circadian rhythms in neurodegenerative disorders [^1166jrxu]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Circadian rhythms are physiological and behavioural cycles generated by an endogenous biological clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus. The circadian system influences the majority of physiological processes, including sleep-wake homeostasis. Impaired sleep and alertness are common symptoms of neurodegenerative disorders, and circadian dysfunction might exacerbate the disease process. The pathophysiology of sleep-wake disturbances in these disorders remains largely unknown, and is presumably multifactorial. Circadian rhythm dysfunction is often observed in patients with Alzheimer disease, in whom it has a major impact on quality of life and represents one of the most important factors leading to institutionalization of patients. Similarly, sleep and circadian problems represent common nonmotor features of Parkinson disease and Huntington disease. Clinical studies and experiments in animal models of neurodegenerative disorders have revealed the progressive nature of circadian dysfunction throughout the course of neurodegeneration, and suggest strategies for the restoration of circadian rhythmicity involving behavioural and pharmacological interventions that target the sleep-wake cycle. In this Review, we discuss the role of the circadian system in the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle, and outline the implications of disrupted circadian timekeeping in neurodegenerative diseases.

### Astrocytes control circadian timekeeping in the suprachiasmatic nucleus via glutamatergic signaling [^115AdzgQ]. Neuron (2017). Low credibility.

Our findings speak to unresolved questions regarding the tailoring of astrocytic function in different brain areas to selectively facilitate circuit control of distinct behaviors. Although astrocytes have been variously implicated in the expression of sleep-wake states, current reports mainly focus on homeostatic control of sleep. Our data instead demonstrate a purely circadian role of SCN astrocytes, independent of light/dark cycles and/or sleep centers, as shown by changes of circadian periodicity elicited by SCN astrocytes in constant darkness. It is therefore likely that the particular astrocytic contingents of different brain areas may play distinct roles on the circadian and homeostatic control of sleep. It is, however, remarkable that extracellular glutamate secreted by astrocytes seems to play a similar role as a synchronizing agent across different timescales, as shown for cortical slow waves, and now for hypothalamic SCN circadian waves, suggesting a unifying timing property for it in oscillatory function.

### Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock [^1168xpPA]. Human Molecular Genetics (2006). Low credibility.

Circadian rhythms are approximately 24-h oscillations in behavior and physiology, which are internally generated and function to anticipate the environmental changes associated with the solar day. A conserved transcriptional-translational autoregulatory loop generates molecular oscillations of 'clock genes' at the cellular level. In mammals, the circadian system is organized in a hierarchical manner, in which a master pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) regulates downstream oscillators in peripheral tissues. Recent findings have revealed that the clock is cell-autonomous and self-sustained not only in a central pacemaker, the SCN, but also in peripheral tissues and in dissociated cultured cells. It is becoming evident that specific contribution of each clock component and interactions among the components vary in a tissue-specific manner. Here, we review the general mechanisms of the circadian clockwork, describe recent findings that elucidate tissue-specific expression patterns of the clock genes and address the importance of circadian regulation in peripheral tissues for an organism's overall well-being.

### The choroid plexus is an important circadian clock component [^116yPqYQ]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Mammalian circadian clocks have a hierarchical organization, governed by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus. The brain itself contains multiple loci that maintain autonomous circadian rhythmicity, but the contribution of the non-SCN clocks to this hierarchy remains unclear. We examine circadian oscillations of clock gene expression in various brain loci and discovered that in mouse, robust, higher amplitude, relatively faster oscillations occur in the choroid plexus (CP) compared to the SCN. Our computational analysis and modeling show that the CP achieves these properties by synchronization of "twist" circadian oscillators via gap-junctional connections. Using an in vitro tissue coculture model and in vivo targeted deletion of the Bmal1 gene to silence the CP circadian clock, we demonstrate that the CP clock adjusts the SCN clock likely via circulation of cerebrospinal fluid, thus finely tuning behavioral circadian rhythms.

### Measuring seasonal time within the circadian system: regulation of the suprachiasmatic nuclei by photoperiod [^112nvgoB]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2005). Low credibility.

Day-length (photoperiod) is the primary environmental signal used to synchronise endogenous rhythms of physiology and behaviour. In mammals, the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus house the master circadian clock. The SCN incorporate photoperiodic information and therefore measure both daily and seasonal time. Over the past decade, there have been significant advances in the understanding of the molecular basis of circadian clocks. It is now becoming apparent that the core molecular clock mechanism is itself regulated by photoperiod, although there is currently debate as to how this occurs. One recent model proposes that distinct groups of core 'clock genes' are associated with either morning or evening phases of the daily light/dark cycle. However, the validity of associating particular genes to morning and evening has been questioned. This article reviews the evidence for photoperiodic regulation of circadian clock function and then discusses alternative models that may explain the available data.

### Electric lighting, adolescent sleep and circadian outcomes, and recommendations for improving light health [^1131Pkmq]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Light is the primary entraining agent synchronizing human circadian rhythms to the solar day. In humans, the central pacemaker in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) orchestrates the circadian timing of bodily processes, including sleep-wake patterns, hormone expression (melatonin, cortisol), and body temperature over the 24-h light-dark cycle. Melatonin rises in the evening (typically associated with sleep onset), and peaks in the early morning hours before falling to low levels during the daytime. In tandem, cortisol rises in the early morning (typically associated with wakefulness) and declines across the day until reaching an evening nadir. Among other cues, these hormonal signals synchronize the timing of molecular clocks found in the body and collectively this network of oscillators drives robust daily rhythms throughout our body.

### Shift work and its association with metabolic disorders [^112bsEpf]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2015). Low credibility.

Circadian rhythm

The circadian rhythm has three main characteristics: it is endogenous, resistant to abrupt changes and may be slow to adapt to changing conditions. The central nervous system (CNS) is the major synchronizer of the human circadian rhythm, and coordinates circadian pacemakers in the brain and peripheral tissues through signals generated in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus which align the circadian period and phase with external stimuli.

The functional organization of the circadian system is comprised of three main components: inputs, which can reset the central pacemaker so that it becomes coincident with the external environment (light/dark cycles, social contacts, physical exercise, food); the central pacemaker and peripheral oscillators, present in most peripheral tissues and organs, and even under the command of SCN may occasionally desynchronize the circadian rhythm; and outputs, which are the physiological and behavioral functions, which may also provide feedback by modifying the function of the SCN, oscillators peripheral and suprachiasmatic nucleus (sleep/wakefulness, locomotor activity, endocrine rhythms, body temperature, cardiovascular rhythm, feeding time).

The SCN is directly connected to the retina via the retinal-hypothalamic tract. Signals sent over this pathway synchronize the circadian system to the 24 h day. The SCN then coordinates the remaining oscillators in the brain and peripheral tissues. The light–dark cycle is the most important synchronizer in the central circadian pacemaker, while feeding schedules are the most important Zeitgebers, or external synchronizers. As such, abrupt changes in feeding times and others several process, including peripheral temperature control and the sleep-wake cycle, can lead to the desynchronization of circadian rhythms.

The causes and consequences of circadian desynchronization may also result from changes in physiological circadian periodicity induced by situational factors such as alterations in light–dark synchronization due to continuous or nocturnal light exposure, frequent snacking, reduced physical activity, nocturnal eating habits or physical activity, daylight savings time and changes in time zone. Since night and shift work tend to affect all aforementioned factors, such schedules are likely to have a significant effect on worker health.

Although accumulating evidence points to a strong relationship between the sleep–wake cycle and AD pathogenesis, it is important to consider the potential role of the circadian system in mediating some of the observed effects. In the next section, we will discuss how the circadian clock system regulates the sleep–wake cycle and many other aspects of physiology. Although the circadian clock and the sleep–wake cycle are intimately linked, the circadian system is an independent entity with unique therapeutic targets and considerations.

Circadian rhythms are critical to human health

Circadian rhythms, defined as oscillations with a period of 24 h, are a fundamental component of mammalian physiology. Nearly all terrestrial organisms have circadian clock systems that serve to coordinate physiology with external cues such as the light–dark cycle. The circadian oscillation of the sleep–wake cycle is just one of many circadian processes in the body, and it is directly controlled by the circadian clock in mice and humans. Systemic circadian rhythms, such as those observed in the sleep–wake cycle, hormone secretion, and blood pressure, are controlled by the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN signals via multiple mechanisms, including the autonomic nervous and hormone release, to synchronize cell-autonomous peripheral clocks throughout the body. The SCN controls circadian secretion of melatonin, the 'dark' hormone which promotes sleep onset, and SCN lesions lead to loss of circadian rhythms and an arrhythmic sleep–wake cycle in mice.
