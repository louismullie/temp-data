## Question

Pseudo barter like syndrome

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Pseudo-Bartter syndrome, including its definition, pathophysiology, etiologies, clinical presentation, diagnostic approach, differential diagnosis, management, prognosis, and special considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and why it is "pseudo". Then, I should verify the pathophysiology, especially the renal mechanisms in cystic fibrosis and the role of pendrin. Next, I will enumerate etiologies beyond CF, review the clinical phenotype, and outline a diagnostic algorithm. After that, I need to construct a careful differential with distinguishing features, detail management principles, and appraise prognosis and special scenarios, including CF newborn screening nuances and drug-induced cases.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't conflate entities. Pseudo-Bartter syndrome (PBS) is a clinical syndrome characterized by hypokalemia, hypochloremia, hyponatremia, and metabolic alkalosis with secondary hyperaldosteronism, but without a primary renal tubular transport defect, which is why it is "pseudo" and not true Bartter syndrome [^1143JZm6].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology, and I need to ensure I separate the classic CF mechanism from other causes. In cystic fibrosis, CFTR dysfunction in β-intercalated cells impairs chloride/bicarbonate exchange and pendrin-mediated bicarbonate secretion, so during volume depletion the kidney cannot appropriately excrete bicarbonate, worsening metabolic alkalosis; chloride loss from sweat and gastrointestinal sources drives volume contraction and RAAS activation, producing hypokalemia and alkalosis despite normal renal tubules, which explains the pseudo-Bartter phenotype in CF [^115U5QVT] [^114bcob6]. Hold on, let me verify the non-CF mechanisms too: extrarenal chloride losses (vomiting, diarrhea, laxatives, diuretics), surreptitious diuretic use, and certain drugs can mimic Bartter physiology by causing chloride-responsive metabolic alkalosis with secondary hyperaldosteronism, again without intrinsic tubular defects [^114bcob6] [^1133Geru].

> Next, I should review etiologies systematically so I don't miss important mimics. Primary etiologies include cystic fibrosis, congenital chloride diarrhea due to SLC26A3 mutations, and acquired causes such as chronic vomiting, laxative or diuretic abuse, and drug-induced tubulopathies including polymyxins and colistin; maternal eating disorders can also produce neonatal PBS via breast milk electrolyte patterns, so I need to check maternal history carefully [^116rxHin] [^1158FLoo] [^113Ey4rK] [^115N8VZf] [^112EH5sv] [^115bqf17].

> Let me consider the clinical phenotype and make sure I align it with the literature. PBS typically presents in infancy or early childhood with dehydration, polyuria, polydipsia, muscle weakness or cramping, failure to thrive, and apathy. Laboratory features include hypokalemia, hypochloremia, hyponatremia, metabolic alkalosis, elevated renin and aldosterone, and low urine chloride during volume depletion, with polyuria being particularly prominent in pediatric series [^117UNo3b] [^1139VgkX] [^115TggEy] [^1143JZm6].

> I should double-check the diagnostic approach so I don't overcall Bartter syndrome. The workup should start with serum electrolytes, blood gas, renin, aldosterone, and urine electrolytes; in volume-depleted, chloride-responsive metabolic alkalosis, urine chloride is typically low, which helps distinguish PBS from renal tubulopathies where urine chloride is often high, though I must interpret this in clinical context [^114bcob6]. Next, I need to check for CF with sweat chloride testing and CFTR genetics, recognizing that some CFTR-related disorders may have intermediate sweat chloride and require functional assays such as ROMA or nasal potential difference; if CF is excluded, I should consider SLC26A3 for congenital chloride diarrhea and targeted tubulopathy panels when indicated [^112dCPBF] [^11325ck8] [^116rxHin] [^112jD7gh]. But wait, what if the phenotype is drug-induced? I should review medication exposures meticulously, including polymyxins and colistin, which can cause acquired Bartter-like tubulopathy with hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis [^115N8VZf] [^112EH5sv].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about Bartter or Gitelman without a structured differential. True Bartter syndrome presents early with polyuria, hypercalciuria, and often nephrocalcinosis due to TAL defects, whereas Gitelman syndrome typically shows hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria from DCT NCC dysfunction; both have high renin/aldosterone and normal blood pressure, so urinary calcium and magnesium help separate them, and genetic testing is often needed when the phenotype is atypical or overlapping [^115bhrBv] [^112Vk2pv]. I should confirm that diuretic loading tests can assist in selected cases, but I must remember they can be misleading in atypical or mild phenotypes and do not replace genotyping when results are discordant [^112ayWDV] [^117KeYte] [^117NiDkH].

> Let me think about management principles and ensure I tailor them to the cause. Acute care centers on isotonic saline resuscitation with careful potassium and chloride repletion, correction of metabolic alkalosis, and close monitoring for complications such as arrhythmias or neurologic sequelae. In CF-associated PBS, long-term management includes CF-directed care, salt supplementation, and attention to pancreatic insufficiency and nutrition, while drug-induced cases require withdrawal of the offending agent and supportive electrolyte management [^1143JZm6] [^112EH5sv]. I should confirm that in recurrent or refractory cases, ongoing salt and potassium supplementation may be necessary, and that multidisciplinary follow-up is prudent to monitor growth, renal function, and CF-related complications [^112Jov2a].

> I need to check prognosis and special considerations so counseling is accurate. In CF-associated PBS, recurrence is common, especially in infants and in warm climates, and some children with isolated PBS may represent CFTR-related disorders that warrant longitudinal follow-up at CF centers even if they do not meet classic CF criteria; conversely, drug-induced PBS generally resolves after drug cessation, though rechallenge can reproduce the syndrome, so documentation and avoidance are key [^117UNo3b] [^11325ck8] [^112dCPBF] [^116kivnC]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought CF newborn screening would reliably prevent PBS presentations, but I should correct that: screen-negative infants and even carriers can present with PBS, so a high index of suspicion remains essential in the right clinical context [^11325ck8] [^112dCPBF].

> In summary, Pseudo-Bartter syndrome reflects a secondary hyperaldosteronism state with hypokalemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis driven by extrarenal chloride losses or acquired tubular effects, most classically in cystic fibrosis via impaired collecting duct bicarbonate handling. Accurate diagnosis hinges on integrating clinical context, urine chloride, and targeted testing for CF, CCD, and culprit drugs, while management focuses on volume and electrolyte correction and etiologic treatment to prevent recurrence and complications [^115U5QVT] [^114bcob6] [^117UNo3b].

Pseudo-Bartter syndrome is a **metabolic alkalosis with hypokalemia and hypochloremia** [^117UNo3b] caused by extrarenal chloride loss (sweat, GI) or diuretic use, not a primary renal tubular defect [^117UNo3b] [^1133Geru] [^1143JZm6]. It is most often linked to cystic fibrosis [^114DTuFs] but also occurs with vomiting, diarrhea, laxative/diuretic abuse, or polymyxins [^117UNo3b] [^112ayWDV] [^113Ey4rK] [^115N8VZf] [^112EH5sv]. Diagnosis relies on **clinical context, low urine chloride, and exclusion of true Bartter/Gitelman** with genetic testing when needed [^114bcob6] [^112jD7gh]. Management is **correcting the cause, rehydration, and electrolyte replacement**; prognosis is excellent with treatment, but recurrence is common if the underlying cause persists [^1143JZm6] [^112Jov2a].

---

## Pathophysiology

Pseudo-Bartter syndrome arises from **extrarenal chloride loss** (sweat, GI) or diuretic-induced renal losses, triggering secondary hyperaldosteronism that increases renal sodium reabsorption and potassium/hydrogen secretion, causing hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis [^114bcob6]. In cystic fibrosis, CFTR dysfunction impairs sweat chloride reabsorption, and renal pendrin downregulation limits bicarbonate secretion, worsening alkalosis [^114bcob6].

---

## Clinical features

Patients typically present with:

- **Electrolyte abnormalities**: Hypokalemia, hypochloremia, metabolic alkalosis, and secondary hyperaldosteronism [^117UNo3b] [^1133Geru].
- **Volume depletion**: Dehydration, polyuria, polydipsia, and muscle weakness [^115TggEy] [^1143JZm6].
- **Associated symptoms**: Failure to thrive, vomiting, diarrhea, and respiratory symptoms in cystic fibrosis [^115TggEy] [^112Jov2a].

---

## Causes and risk factors

Pseudo-Bartter syndrome is associated with several **conditions and exposures**:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Genetic disorders | Cystic fibrosis (most common), congenital chloride diarrhea [^114DTuFs] [^116rxHin] |
| Gastrointestinal losses | Vomiting, diarrhea, laxative abuse [^117UNo3b] [^114bcob6] |
| Diuretic use | Loop and thiazide diuretics [^114bcob6] |
| Medications | Polymyxin B, colistin [^115N8VZf] [^112EH5sv] |
| Environmental factors | Hot weather, excessive sweating [^117UNo3b] |

---

## Diagnostic criteria and laboratory findings

Diagnosis is based on **clinical context, laboratory studies, and exclusion of true Bartter/Gitelman**:

- **Electrolyte profile**: Hypokalemia, hypochloremia, metabolic alkalosis, elevated renin and aldosterone [^114bcob6].
- **Urine chloride**: Low (< 10 mmol/L) indicating extrarenal chloride loss [^notfound].
- **Exclusion of true Bartter/Gitelman**: Genetic testing for SLC12A1, KCNJ1, CLCNKB, SLCA12A3 when suspected [^111wa8ht] [^112jD7gh].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Pseudo-Bartter syndrome must be differentiated from:

- **True Bartter syndrome**: Genetic defects in the thick ascending limb (SLC12A1, KCNJ1, CLCNKB) [^111wa8ht].
- **Gitelman syndrome**: Defect in the distal convoluted tubule (SLC12A3) [^115NmFW3].
- **Other causes**: Diuretic use, vomiting, diarrhea, and laxative abuse [^114bcob6].

---

## Management strategies

Management focuses on correcting the underlying cause, rehydration, and electrolyte replacement:

- **Treat underlying cause**: Stop diuretics/laxatives, treat cystic fibrosis or GI losses [^114bcob6].
- **Rehydration**: Intravenous fluids with sodium chloride [^1143JZm6].
- **Electrolyte replacement**: Potassium and chloride supplementation [^114bcob6].
- **Monitor**: Frequent electrolyte checks and adjust therapy [^112EH5sv].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis is **excellent with treatment**, but recurrence is common if the cause persists [^112Jov2a]. Complications include muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and growth failure if untreated [^113YoDda].

---

## Preventive measures

Prevention centers on **patient education** about risks with diuretics/laxatives, electrolyte monitoring during high-risk therapies, and early recognition and treatment of dehydration/electrolyte losses [^112EH5sv] [^1143JZm6].

---

Pseudo-Bartter syndrome is a **reversible electrolyte disorder** from extrarenal chloride loss or diuretic use; **identifying and treating the cause** leads to excellent outcomes, but recurrence is common without ongoing management.

### Should isolated pseudo-bartter syndrome be considered a CFTR-related disorder of infancy? [^11325ck8]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Infants that are negative to cystic fibrosis (CF) newborn screening (NBS) programs, or in countries without NBS, may present with metabolic alkalosis and severe salt depletion, a well-known clinical manifestation of CF termed Pseudo-Bartter syndrome (PBS). Here, we report the cases of three CF-negative children, who carry rare mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, and, for whom, PBS was the only manifestation of CFTR protein dysfunction. There is no diagnostic label for these cases.

Methods

Medical records of patients followed at our Cystic Fibrosis Centre were revised and data were collected for all patients who presented with an isolated PBS. The syndrome was defined as an episode of dehydration with low levels of serum sodium (< 134mmol/L), potassium (< 3.4mmol/L), and chloride (< 100mmol/L), with metabolic alkalosis (bicarbonatemia > 27mmol/L) in the absence of renal tubulopathy.

Results

Three out of 73 (4%) CF infants presented with a severe metabolic alkalosis with salt depletion; two of these required admission to the intensive care unit. Two infants had a negative NBS, and one was identified as a CF carrier. Sweat test was repeatedly in the negative/borderline ranges for all patients. Less than two CF causing mutations were identified (F508del/R1070W, F508del; L467F/P5L, R1066H/P5L). During a mean follow-up of 9 years, the children had no other CF manifestations.

Conclusion

We suggest that PBS as the sole manifestation of CFTR dysfunction might be considered a CFTR-related disorder of infancy.

### Polymyxin B-induced bartter syndrome [^116kivnC]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Bartter syndrome is a genetic disorder characterised by chloride-unresponsive metabolic alkalosis, hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia and hypercalciuria. While it commonly presents antenatally or in early infancy, sometimes, drugs can induce a state similar to Bartter syndrome in any age group, called acquired Bartter syndrome. Polymyxins and aminoglycosides are the most commonly implicated drugs. Polymyxin B and polymyxin E (popularly known as colistin) are the two chemically similar polymyxins that are commonly used clinically. While colistin is frequently associated with nephrotoxicity, polymyxin B is generally considered less nephrotoxic. This difference is due to the way these two drugs are handled by the kidneys. In this case report, we discuss a middle-aged male who developed Bartter syndrome due to polymyxin B, which resolved on discontinuation of the drug, and re-appeared after its re-introduction later. This case exemplifies the nephrotoxicity caused by polymyxin B and the need for vigilance when using this drug.

### Transient hyponatremia of prematurity caused by mild bartter syndrome type II: a case report [^113SAWRT]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Strong Ions vs Age. Trend of strong ions (sodium and potassium) from point of care blood gases and serum electrolytes overtime from day of life 0 until 7 weeks of age. The straight lines represent the serum electrolyte values, and the shapes represent point of care test values

Further investigations revealed a normal magnesium level of 0.95 mmol/L [0.65–1.05 mmol/L], an elevated aldosterone of > 27,000 pmol/L [normal 320–4621 pmol/L], and elevated renin at > 3000 ng/L [upper limit of normal 175 ng/L]. The cortisol was 629 nmol/L [133–537 nmol/L], ACTH was 6.6 pmol/L [normal 1.98–12.47 pmol/L], and 17-OHP was mildly elevated at 14.8 nmol/L [normal 0.2–4.7 nmol/L]. These findings were sufficient to rule out congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21 hydroxylase deficiency.

Testing of the urine on day of life 7 revealed an osmolality of 369 mOsm/kg [reference interval in neonates not well established], high sodium of 118 mmol/L [renal salt wasting defined as urinary sodium > 40 mmol/L], low potassium of 7 mmol/L, chloride of 94 mmol/L, and low urine creatinine of 0.3 mmol/L. As there are no established normal urine electrolyte values, these should be interpreted in context with serum values. This represents a fractional sodium excretion of 16.9% in a clinically hypovolemic patient which would suggest tubular dysfunction, however, there are no reference intervals for premature infants.

Differential diagnosis

Initially consideration was given to renal etiologies of primary sodium depletion including Bartter syndrome and pseudohypoaldosteronism. Adrenogenital syndromes were unlikely given normal female genitalia and normal newborn screening results. Of the Bartter syndromes, type II was more likely given that she initially did not present with hypokalemia or hypochloremia. These electrolyte abnormalities can develop later in the presentation of type II Bartter syndrome. Additionally, given the normal blood pressure measurements and lack of metabolic acidosis, pseudohypoaldosteronism type I and II were unlikely.

### Unexpected clinical sequelae of gitelman syndrome: hypertension in adulthood is common and females have higher potassium requirements [^114qR1Hw]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

We also find that hypertensive GS patients are more likely to have mutations in the C-terminal domain of SLC12A3. Given that exon 26 mutations may also confer a more severe phenotype as evidenced by higher potassium requirements, we hypothesize that the C-terminal domain is vital for NCCT function mediated through its role in protein trafficking. More severe electrolyte wasting (as observed in exon 26 patients) may give rise to more exaggerated compensatory mechanisms (stimulation of the renin–aldosterone axis) and the subsequent development of hypertension.

While we cannot explicitly rule out a second diagnosis in young GS sufferers, this unexpectedly high frequency suggests that hypertension may be a predicted feature of the GS population as the natural history of the disorder emerges. Long-term follow-up studies in GS are rare, with only one recent publication noting coexistent hypertension in 4 of 15 genetically-proven subjects. Other reports suggest a link between the secondary hyperaldosteronism of Bartter syndrome and subsequent focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.

### A novel splicing mutation in SLC12A3 associated with gitelman syndrome and idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^116BZYGt]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

We report a case of Gitelman syndrome (GS) in a dizygotic twin who presented at 12 years of age with growth delay, metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia with inappropriate kaliuresis, and idiopathic intracranial hypertension with bilateral papilledema (pseudotumor cerebri). The patient, her twin sister, and her mother also presented with cerebral cavernous malformations. Based on the early onset and normocalciuria, Bartter syndrome was diagnosed first. However, mutation analysis showed that the proband is a compound heterozygote for 2 mutations in SLC12A3: a substitution of serine by leucine at amino acid position 555 (p. Ser555Leu) and a novel guanine to cytosine transition at the 5' splice site of intron 22 (c.2633+1G > C), providing the molecular diagnosis of GS. These mutations were not detected in 200 normal chromosomes and cosegregated within the family. Analysis of complementary DNA showed that the heterozygous nucleotide change c.2633+1G > C caused the appearance of 2 RNA molecules, 1 normal transcript and 1 skipping the entire exon 22 (r.2521_2634del). Supplementation with potassium and magnesium improved clinical symptoms and resulted in catch-up growth, but vision remained impaired. Three similar associations of Bartter syndrome/GS with pseudotumor cerebri were found in the literature, suggesting that electrolyte abnormalities and secondary aldosteronism may have a role in idiopathic intracranial hypertension. This study provides further evidence for the phenotypical heterogeneity of GS and its association with severe manifestations in children. It also shows the independent segregation of familial cavernomatosis and GS.

### Cystic fibrosis in India [^111YC7nt]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2007). Low credibility.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) was considered to be non-existent in Indian subcontinent. Reports in last one decade have suggested that cystic fibrosis occurs in India but its precise magnitude is not known. Studies on migrant Indian population in United States and United Kingdom estimate frequency of CF as 1:10,000 to 1:40,000. The clinical features are similar to that reported in Caucasian population. CF in Indian children is usually diagnosed late and in advanced stage. Children are more malnourished and may have clinically evident deficiency of fat soluble vitamins. The frequency of clubbing, colonization with Pseudomonas, and laboratory evidence of pseudo-Bartter syndrome is relatively more at the time of diagnosis. Diagnostic facilities in form of sweat chloride estimation and genetic studies are not available readily. Mutation profile is different. The frequency of common mutation F508del in Indian children is between 19% and 34%. Other mutations are heterogeneous. Management of CF in India is difficult due to less number of trained manpower, limited availability, and high cost of pharmacologic agents. The determinants of early death include: severe malnutrition and colonization with Pseudomonas at the time of diagnosis, more than four episodes of lower respiratory infection per year and age of onset of symptoms before 2 months of age. To conclude, CF does occur in India; however, precise magnitude of problem is not known. There is need to create awareness amongst pediatricians, developing diagnostic facilities, and management protocols based on locally available resources.

### Diagnostic and management considerations in pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1b [^115ZtG8r]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1B is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by dysfunction of amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs). We present the case of a neonate with cardiogenic shock after cardiac arrest due to profound hyperkalaemia. Genetic testing revealed a novel homozygous variant in SCNNIA We review diagnostic considerations including the molecular mechanisms of disease, discuss treatment approaches and highlight the possible significance of the diversity of pulmonary ENaCs.

### Congenital chloride diarrhea needs to be distinguished from bartter and gitelman syndrome [^116rxHin]. Journal of Human Genetics (2018). Low credibility.

Pseudo-Bartter/Gitelman syndrome (p-BS/GS) encompasses a clinically heterogeneous group of inherited or acquired disorders similar to Bartter syndrome (BS) or Gitelman syndrome (GS), both renal salt-losing tubulopathies. Phenotypic overlap frequently occurs between p-BS/GS and BS/GS, which are difficult to diagnose based on their clinical presentation and require genetic tests for accurate diagnosis. In addition, p-BS/GS can occur as a result of other inherited diseases such as cystic fibrosis, autosomal dominant hypocalcemia, Dent disease, or congenital chloride diarrhea (CCD). However, the detection of the variants in genes other than known BS/GS-causing genes by conventional Sanger sequencing requires substantial time and resources. We studied 27 cases clinically diagnosed with BS/GS, but with negative genetic tests for known BS/GS genes. We conducted targeted sequencing for 22 genes including genes responsible for tubulopathies and other inherited diseases manifesting with p-BS/GS symptoms. We detected the SLC26A3 gene variants responsible for CCD in two patients. In Patient 1, we found the SLC26A3 compound heterozygous variants: c.354delC and c.1008insT. In Patient 2, we identified the compound heterozygous variants: c.877G > A, p.(Glu293Lys), and c.1008insT. Our results suggest that a comprehensive genetic screening system using targeted sequencing is useful for the diagnosis of patients with p-BS/GS with alternative genetic origins.

### Liquorice, liddle, bartter or gitelman-how to differentiate? [^112gz7Tb]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypokalaemia with alkalosis can suggest excess aldosterone. Aldosterone stimulates the collecting duct mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) to upregulate the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and stimulate electrogenic sodium reabsorption, with secretion of potassium and protons. Gitelman, Bartter and Liddle syndrome, and liquorice ingestion all cause hypokalaemic alkalosis. This mini-review outlines the pathophysiology of these conditions as well as how to differentiate them.

### Neonatal pseudo-bartter syndrome due to maternal eating disorder [^115bqf17]. Journal of Perinatology (2008). Low credibility.

A total of 4 of 153 low birth weight infants at our hospital were found to have pseudo-Bartter syndrome in 2005 and 2006. The neonates (two of whom were twins; light for gestational age 2, appropriate for gestational age 1 and small for gestational age 1) showed symptoms of apnea and/or poor feeding or patent ductus arteriosus, which disappeared by day 4. Hypokalemia, hypochloremia and metabolic alkalosis normalized by day 8. The mothers had repeatedly rushed to the restroom after eating while in hospital, and were lighter at delivery than before pregnancy; however, vomiting was not observed. The mothers had several stress factors related to pregnancy, and all recovered from the eating disorder after delivery. Urinary Cl/creatinine (mequiv. mg⁻¹) and serum Mg in the infants were < 0.1 and 1.6 to 2.3 mg per 100 ml, respectively. Eating disorder during pregnancy may have caused Bartter-like syndrome and weight loss, and led to the same syndrome and intrauterine growth retardation in the offspring. Therefore, a hidden maternal eating disorder may underlie neonatal pseudo-Bartter syndrome.

### Clinical and genetic characteristics of children with cystic fibrosis in henan China: a single-center retrospective analysis [^113J4b9P]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite the growing awareness of cystic fibrosis (CF) in China, few cases have been reported in Henan, which is the most populous province in the country. This study aimed to describe the clinical phenotype and genotype of children with CF in Henan.

Methods

We retrospectively recruited 18 Chinese children with CF who presented to Children's Hospital affiliated to Zhengzhou University from January 2019 to June 2023. The demographic data, imaging examinations, and laboratory tests of the patients were reviewed to clarify the clinical phenotype. Whole exome sequencing was conducted to identify the genotype.

Results

Respiratory diseases were the main clinical manifestation, including recurrent/persistent pneumonia (88.9%), sinusitis (77.8%), bronchiectasis (77.8%). CF-related liver disease and pancreatic insufficiency were less common. Infant cases had high frequency of pseudo-Bartter Syndrome (80.0%). Chest computed tomography showed bronchiectasis in older children and air trapping in infant cases. The most common pathogens in the airway were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (72.2%) and Staphylococcus aureus (66.7%). Twenty-five different cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene variants were detected, including five novel observations (c.1064C > G[p. Pro355Arg], c.1209+1G > C, c.1925C > G[p. Ser642X], c.2810T > G[p. Leu937Arg], and c.3792delA[p. Gly1265GlufsX13]). The most common variant was c.2909G > A(p. Gly970Asp), with a detected rate of 21.9%.

Conclusion

Children with CF in Henan had varied clinical phenotypes by age, with respiratory disease being predominant. The most frequent CFTR gene variant was c.2909G > A(p. Gly970Asp). This study is the first and most comprehensive one on the clinical phenotype and genotype of children with CF in Henan, China. We also reported the first CF case of Mycobacterium abscessus infection in China.

### Late diagnosis of congenital chloride diarrhea mimicking Hirschsprung's disease [^114DTuFs]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Congenital chloride diarrhea can easily be misdiagnosed as Bartter syndrome due to similar laboratory findings. However, the primary defect in Bartter syndrome is in the triple electrolyte cotransporter (Na/K/2Cl) in the thick ascending arm of Henle. Bartter syndrome is characterized by polydipsia, polyuria, increased excretion of sodium and chloride in urine, and dehydration, accompanied by vomiting and constipation. Laboratory tests show hypochloremic hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis and increased aldosterone and renin levels. Our patient was referred to us after being misdiagnosed with Bartter syndrome 5 days prior. At our hospital, we excluded Bartter syndrome through normal urinary electrolytes and serum aldosterone levels. A slightly elevated renin level was attributed to mild dehydration in the patient. When Bartter syndrome is ruled out, Pseudo Bartter syndrome may be considered due to similar clinical presentation. It differs from Bartter syndrome because biochemical changes occur without tubular dysfunction in Pseudo Bartter syndrome. The leading cause of Pseudo Bartter syndrome is cystic fibrosis. Still, it can also result from CCD, Gitelman syndrome, diuretic drug use, long-term chlorine-poor diet, cyclic vomiting attacks, and long-term laxative drug use. In our patient, CCD was diagnosed and confirmed by examinations after excluding cystic fibrosis and other etiological causes of Pseudo Bartter syndrome.

Patients with CCD may experience chronic diarrhea, failure to thrive, acute dehydration attacks in infections, psychomotor delay, chronic kidney disease, male subfertility, and inflammatory bowel disease. The most critical points to prevent the development of all these negative prognostic pictures are regular NaCl/KCl supplementation, periodic evaluation of serum electrolytes, renin and aldosterone, growth parameters, renal functions, and psychomotor development, vaccination compliance, and intermittent examination for infertility.

### Transient hyponatremia of prematurity caused by mild bartter syndrome type II: a case report [^117SqQeD]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

It has been suggested that the combination of mutations is a crucial determinant in the severity of the phenotype. We hypothesize that our patient's mild presentation of Bartter syndrome may be a result of having two pathogenic variants outside of the transmembrane domain. The resolution of the hyponatremia may also be explained by the recruitment of additional nephrons due to the physiological postnatal adaptation of renal function. These additional nephrons could compensate for ongoing salt wasting and sufficient compensatory mechanisms may avoid the hypokalemic alkalosis. Interestingly, not all patients with KCNJ1 mutations develop hypochloremia. We hypothesize that in our patient, only the net potassium and sodium excretion were corrected. Clinically polyuria and polydipsia as well as net calcium excretion remained altered.

This case presents a combination of mutations in the KCNJ1 gene whose electrolyte abnormalities resolved at 7 weeks of age and only progressed to a mild phenotype. Future presentations of resolving electrolyte abnormalities warrant consideration of Bartter syndrome and specifically mutations on the KCNJ1 gene. Such patients should be diagnosed with Bartter syndrome type II and remain under the care of a pediatric nephrologist. This case adds to our understanding of the variability of Bartter syndrome and may be used to guide further research into the entity.

### Gitelman syndrome in a South African family presenting with hypokalaemia and unusual food cravings [^111LnHzK]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Gitelman syndrome (GS) is an autosomal recessive renal tubular disorder which is characterised by renal salt wasting with hypokalaemia, metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesaemia and hypocalciuria. It is caused by mutations in the solute carrier family 12, member 3 gene (SLC12A3) encoding the sodium-chloride cotransporter (NCC) of the distal convoluted tubule (DCT). Although a proportion of patients with GS have homozygous mutations, the majority are compound heterozygotes, with a different mutation on each allele. It is therefore not uncommon to encounter affected cases in successive generations of the same family, giving rise to a pseudo-dominant pattern of inheritance.

GS usually presents during adolescence or adulthood, although it may be completely asymptomatic for life. Common symptoms include cramps or tetany, paraesthesias, lethargy, muscle weakness and, rarely, periodic paralysis. Polydipsia and nocturia commonly occur, as well as cravings for salty substances. Uncommonly, patients may have growth retardation, delayed puberty, cardiac dysrhythmias or sudden cardiac death. Diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease have been reported with higher frequencies in GS than in the general population. A large amount of phenotype variability occurs, with poor correlation between specific mutations and clinical manifestations. Moreover, features such as hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia may change throughout the course of one individual's life. Differences in dietary habits or gender may contribute to phenotype variability, but in most cases the reasons are unknown.

The diagnosis of GS is based on the typical symptoms and biochemical abnormalities. It is distinguished from Bartter syndrome (BS) by a low rate of calcium excretion (urine calcium/creatinine ratio ≤ 0.1 mmol/mmol for GS versus > 0.1 mmol/mmol for BS). Genetic analysis is a valuable tool in assisting with the diagnosis of GS, but is available only at specialised centres.

In this paper we describe the clinical, biochemical and genetic features of a South African family with GS. The family is interesting in that several individuals across two generations were affected, the affected individuals reported unusual food cravings, and two novel putative pathogenic mutations were identified.

### Polymyxin B [^115N8VZf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Polymyxin B for Injection, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

Electrolyte and Acid/Base Abnormalities

Postmarketing cases of renal tubulopathy (i.e. Pseudo-Bartter syndrome) have been identified with the use of intravenous polymyxins, including polymyxin B (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). All cases reported hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Other common findings included hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, increased potassium in the urine, normal serum creatinine, and normal blood pressure. Consider electrolyte monitoring during treatment. Normalization of electrolyte abnormalities may require drug discontinuation.

### Pseudo-bartter syndrome: a CFTR-related disorder? [^112dCPBF]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2025). Medium credibility.

This case report presents a 14-month-old boy with a history of cystic fibrosis (CF) carrier status, diagnosed following a positive newborn screening for CF (CF-NBS), who developed symptoms suggestive of Pseudo-Bartter syndrome (PBS). Despite initial evaluations not meeting CF diagnostic criteria, subsequent investigations revealed an intermediate sweat chloride concentration, a second CFTR mutation, and CFTR dysfunction through rectal organoid morphology analysis (ROMA) consistent with CFTR-related disorder (CFTR-RD). This case raises important considerations regarding the diagnosis and management of CFTR-RD. PBS can be considered as a rare presentation of CFTR-RD and can occur in children with sweat chloride below the CF range. Functional testing of CFTR by ROMA enabled a more accurate diagnosis. Despite the negative work-up after CF-NBS, this infant developed CFTR-RD, but this should not be considered as a screen failure. Follow-up of children with CFTR-RD at a CF centre is preferred, because of the risk of developing CF.

### Antenatal bartter syndrome: a new compound heterozygous mutation in exon 2 of KCNJ1 gene [^111doJQJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 30+6/7-week infant was born by vaginal delivery to a 21-year-old primigravida with pregnancy complicated by polyhydramnios. The infant developed polyuria and significant weight loss in the first 2weeks of life despite appropriate fluid management. He developed hyponatraemia, hypochloraemia, transient hyperkalaemia and prerenal azotaemia with metabolic acidosis. On further evaluation, he had elevated plasma renin and aldosterone levels. Bartter syndrome was considered in the differential diagnosis. Bartter syndrome gene panel revealed a rare compound heterozygous mutation in exon 2 of the KCNJ1 gene (Lys186Glu/Thr71Met), suggesting antenatal Bartter syndrome (type 2). The infant developed late-onset hypokalaemia and metabolic alkalosis by week 4 of life. He regained birth weight by week 3 of life but failed to thrive (10–20g/kg/day) despite high caloric intake (140 kcal/kg/day). His electrolyte abnormalities gradually improved, and he was discharged home without the need for electrolyte supplements or medications.

### Differential diagnosis of bartter syndrome, gitelman syndrome, and pseudo-bartter / gitelman syndrome based on clinical characteristics [^114LPDwr]. Genetics in Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Phenotypic overlap exists among type III Bartter syndrome (BS), Gitelman syndrome (GS), and pseudo-BS/GS (p-BS/GS), which are clinically difficult to distinguish. We aimed to clarify the differences between these diseases, allowing accurate diagnosis based on their clinical features.

Methods

A total of 163 patients with genetically defined type III BS (n = 30), GS (n = 90), and p-BS/GS (n = 43) were included. Age at diagnosis, sex, body mass index, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and serum and urine electrolyte concentrations were determined.

Results

Patients with p-BS/GS were significantly older at diagnosis than those with type III BS and GS. Patients with p-BS/GS included a significantly higher percentage of women and had a lower body mass index and estimated glomerular filtration rate than did patients with GS. Although hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria were predominant biochemical findings in patients with GS, 17 and 23% of patients with type III BS and p-BS/GS, respectively, also showed these abnormalities. Of patients with type III BS, GS, and p-BS/GS, 40, 12, and 63%, respectively, presented with chronic kidney disease.

Conclusions

This study clarified the clinical differences between BS, GS, and p-BS/GS for the first time, which will help clinicians establish differential diagnoses for these three conditions.

### Approach to the patient: diagnosis of Cushing syndrome [^1137qZEB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Learning Points

A pseudo-Cushing syndrome should always be considered in patients with endogenous hypercortisolism
Patients with a pseudo-Cushing syndrome can have symptoms associated with endogenous hypercortisolism resembling true Cushing syndrome
The results of first-line screening tests for Cushing syndrome can be influenced by the use of concomitant medication (eg, antiepileptic drugs can cause a false-positive DST)
Midnight salivary cortisol levels and the second-line dexamethasone-CRH test can be useful to differentiate pseudo-Cushing syndrome from ACTH-dependent Cushing syndrome

### Parathyroid hormone and phosphate homeostasis in patients with bartter and gitelman syndrome: an international cross-sectional study [^114XRmdM]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

Small cohort studies have reported high parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in patients with Bartter syndrome and lower serum phosphate levels have anecdotally been reported in patients with Gitelman syndrome. In this cross-sectional study, we assessed PTH and phosphate homeostasis in a large cohort of patients with salt-losing tubulopathies.

Methods

Clinical and laboratory data of 589 patients with Bartter and Gitelman syndrome were provided by members of the European Rare Kidney Diseases Reference Network (ERKNet) and the European Society for Paediatric Nephrology (ESPN).

Results

A total of 285 patients with Bartter syndrome and 304 patients with Gitelman syndrome were included for analysis. Patients with Bartter syndrome type I and II had the highest median PTH level (7.5 pmol/L) and 56% had hyperparathyroidism (PTH > 7.0 pmol/L). Serum calcium was slightly lower in Bartter syndrome type I and II patients with hyperparathyroidism (2.42 versus 2.49 mmol/L; p = 0.038) compared to those with normal PTH levels and correlated inversely with PTH (r s −0.253; p = 0.009). Serum phosphate and urinary phosphate excretion did not correlate with PTH. Overall, 22% of patients had low serum phosphate levels (phosphate — standard deviation score < −2), with the highest prevalence in patients with Bartter syndrome type III (32%). Serum phosphate correlated with tubular maximum reabsorption of phosphate/glomerular filtration rate (TmP/GFR) (r s 0.699; P < .001), suggesting renal phosphate wasting.

Conclusions

Hyperparathyroidism is frequent in patients with Bartter syndrome type I and II. Low serum phosphate is observed in a significant number of patients with Bartter and Gitelman syndrome and appears associated with renal phosphate wasting.

### The genetic spectrum of gitelman (-like) syndromes [^111eazV5]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

CLCNKB – BARTTER TYPE 3

Although recessive CLCKNB mutations have originally been described to cause classic Bartter syndrome (type 3), a systematic analysis of a large cohort of patients demonstrates that 25% of all patients present with a Gitelman syndrome phenotype. In fact, some patients may initially show symptoms of Bartter syndrome and develop a typical Gitelman phenotype in later childhood or adolescence. Consequently, genetic screening of patients with a clinical diagnosis of Gitelman syndrome quite regularly turn out to have CLCKNB mutations upon genetic screening. As large deletions account for up to 40% of all cases of Bartter syndrome type 3, testing for structural variations by MLPA or other means is advised. Compared with classic Gitelman syndrome, patients with CLCKNB mutations have generally an earlier age of initial presentations and slightly higher serum Mg²⁺ and urinary Ca²⁺ concentrations. Patients with CLCKNB mutations may additionally develop chronic kidney disease (up to 25%), nephrocalcinosis (10–20%) or growth retardation.

CLCKNB encodes the ClC Kb Cl⁻ channel that is expressed in the TAL, DCT and collecting duct. Loss-of-function mutations in ClC Kb result in an increased intracellular Cl⁻ concentration. As Cl⁻ inhibits WNK kinases, an increased Cl⁻ concentration causes reduced NCC activity by inhibition of the WNK-SPAK/OSR1 pathway (Fig. 1). A similar regulatory mechanism of NKCC2 exists in the TAL, which explains why ClC Kb mutations may result in both Bartter-like and Gitelman-like syndromes. In general, hypochloremia and increased fractional excretions of Na⁺ and Cl⁻ are more severe in Bartter syndrome type 3 than in Gitelman syndrome, which may reflect that both TAL and DCT are affected by CLCKNB mutations.

### Chronic renal failure, end-stage renal disease, and peritoneal dialysis in Gitelman's syndrome [^1168RLw1]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

The chronic state of hypovolemia, hypotension, and hypokalemia found in Bartter's syndrome has been shown to lead to a chronic nephropathy, which then can progress toward end-stage renal disease and dialysis. This progression, however, has never been reported for Gitelman's syndrome, a variant of Bartter's syndrome that shows a milder clinical picture. This report is the first to document this progression (ie, the development of end-stage renal disease in Gitelman's syndrome) as well as the first report of the use of peritoneal dialysis in either Bartter's syndrome or Gitelman's syndrome. The clinical course highlights the importance of and the need for careful control of hemodynamic status in these patients to slow the progression of renal injury. The hemodynamic alterations that characterize Bartter's syndrome and Gitelman's syndrome patients suggest that for patients requiring renal replacement therapy, peritoneal dialysis is a more appropriate treatment because of its less severe impact on these parameters.

### Contradiction between genetic analysis and diuretic loading test in type I bartter syndrome: a case report [^117NiDkH]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Our experience shows that in BS, the genotype of BS cannot always be diagnosed from the phenotype. Other recent reports and review have also indicated that the genotype-phenotype correlation is not always exact. Conventionally, type I BS in neonates is regarded as serious, but there are reports of a milder "diuresis-only" phenotype among babies delivered at full term with normal birth weight and normal development. In addition, type III BS was hitherto regarded as a relatively mild form; however, recent data indicate that approximately 30% of cases progress to kidney failure. It thus appears likely that cases of BS, such as ours, in which the genotype does not correlate with the phenotype and diuretic loading are in fact quite common; this makes diagnosis using the conventional five-type classification very problematic. Therefore, in order to make a proper diagnosis of the disease BS, we should consider all variations of the disorder as a single disorder (i.e. salt-losing tubulopathy) and genetic testing should be performed aggressively. To better understand the relationship between genotype, phenotype, and tubular channel function, the results of the diuretic loading test should be collected.

To summarize: in many situations, including mild cases of type I BS such as ours, diuretic loading test results may not correlate with BS genotype; this exposes the limited usefulness of the conventional classification system. The diuretic loading test has limited utility for diagnosis especially in atypical cases. On the other hand, this test, which allows assessment of channel function, is useful for better understanding of the genotype-phenotype correlation. Given the lack of standard protocols and interpretation guidelines for diuretic loading tests, the further data collection of the test could be required.

### Parathyroid hormone and phosphate homeostasis in patients with bartter and gitelman syndrome: an international cross-sectional study [^111wa8ht]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Bartter and Gitelman syndrome are genetically distinct hereditary salt-losing tubulopathies that are characterized by hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis secondary to impaired reabsorption of sodium chloride (NaCl) in different segments of the renal tubule. Bartter syndrome is further classified into different subtypes. Bartter syndrome type I and II are caused by biallelic mutations in the SLC12A1 gene encoding the NKCC2 sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter and by biallelic mutations in the KCNJ1 gene encoding the ROMK potassium channel, respectively, both of which are expressed in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (TAL). Bartter syndrome type III results from biallelic mutations in the CLCNKB gene, which encodes the ClC-Kb chloride channel. Bartter syndrome type IV is caused by biallelic mutations in the BSND gene that encodes Barttin, or by molecular abnormalities affecting the two adjacent CLCNKA (encoding the chloride channel ClC-Ka) and CLCNKB genes. Barttin and ClC-Kb are expressed in the TAL and distal convoluted tubule (DCT); ClC-Ka is only expressed in the TAL. Finally, a transient X-linked form of Bartter syndrome (type V Bartter syndrome) has been described in male patients harbouring mutations in the MAGED2 gene, which alters the expression of the NKCC2 and NCC, the sodium chloride cotransporter. Gitelman syndrome is caused by biallelic mutations in the SLC12A3 gene, encoding the NCC, of which the expression is restricted to the DCT.

### Pseudo-bartter syndrome in Chinese children with cystic fibrosis: clinical features and genotypic findings [^112Jov2a]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To characterize the clinical and genotypic features of cystic fibrosis-associated pseudo-Bartter syndrome (CF-PBS) in Chinese children.

Methods

We recruited and characterized the clinical manifestations of 12 Chinese children with CF-PBS. Sweat test, blood and urinary analysis, sputum culture, chest and sinus computed tomography, and abdominal ultrasonography were obtained. Whole-exome sequencing, bioinformatics analysis, and Sanger sequencing validation were performed to define the genotypes.

Results

CF-PBS was accompanied by recurrent and/or persistent pneumonia (91.7%), pancreatitis (83.3%), vomiting and/or diarrhea (66.7%), failure to thrive and liver disease (58.3% respectively), among our patients. The predominant organisms found in the airways were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (83.3%) and Staphylococcus aureus (75.0%). The mean concentrations of blood gas and electrolytes were pH 7.58, bicarbonate 40.8mmol/L, sodium 125.9mmol/L, chloride 77.5mmol/L, and potassium 2.6mmol/L. A high recurrence rate (50.0%) of CF-PBS was observed despite continued electrolyte supplementation during follow-up. In all, 19 different variants of CFTR gene were identified, and 10 of these were found to be novel observations (c.262_266delTTATA[p.L88FfsX21], c.579+2insACAT, c.1210–3C > G, c.1733T > C[p.L578P], c.2236_2246delGAGGCGATACTinsAAAAATC[p.E746KfsX8], c.3068T > G [p. I1023R], c.3635delT[p.V1212AfsX16], c.3859delG[p.G1287EfsX2], c.3964–7A > G and ΔE23 [c.3718-?_3873+?del]). The c.2909G > A[p.G970D] was the most common variant, with an allele frequency of 16.6%. A homozygous genotype of c.1521_1523delCTT[p.F508del] was discovered for the first time in patients of Chinese origin.

Conclusions

In China, CF-PBS usually presents early and recurs frequently in infancy, accompanied by multiple comorbidities. Recurrence of CF-PBS in school-going patients does occur but is rare. The p.G970D is the most frequent variant, with a significant ethnic tendency of Chinese origin.

### Severe failure to thrive in infant [^116mhbVV]. Clinical Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Failure to thrive in an infant has multiple etiologies and at times, is only manifestation of underlying serious disease. Bartter syndrome is a rare disease that manifests as failure to thrive. It can be diagnosed by a careful history, physical examination, and abnormal electrolyte pattern. It can be alleviated by appropriate management, whereas failure to recognize early can be life threatening. A case of severe failure to thrive in an infant due to neonatal form of Bartter syndrome, its manifestations, management, and outcome is presented in this article.

### Cystic fibrosis in the kidney: new lessons from impaired renal HCO3-excretion [^115U5QVT]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

A key role of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in the kidney has recently been uncovered. This needs to be integrated into the understanding of the developed phenotypes in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients.

Recent Findings

In the beta-intercalated cells of the collecting duct, CFTR functions in very similar terms as established in the exocrine pancreatic duct and both CFTR and SLC26A4 (pendrin) orchestrate regulated HCO₃⁻ secretion. Like in the pancreas, the hormone secretin is a key agonist to activate renal HCO₃⁻ secretion. In mice lacking CFTR or pendrin, acute and chronic base challenges trigger marked metabolic alkalosis because collecting duct base secretion is defective. Also in CF patients, the ability to acutely increase renal HCO₃⁻ excretion is markedly reduced.

Summary

The now much enlarged understanding of CFTR in the kidney may permit the measurement of challenged urine HCO₃⁻ excretion as a new biomarker for CF. We suggest a new explanation for the electrolyte disorder in CF termed Pseudo-Bartter Syndrome. The hallmark electrolyte disturbance features of this can be well explained by a reduced function of collecting duct Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchange. Eventually, we suggest the diagnostic term distal renal tubular alkalosis to cover those disturbances that causes metabolic alkalosis by a reduced collecting duct base secretion.

### The genetic spectrum of gitelman (-like) syndromes [^115NmFW3]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Gitelman syndrome is a recessive salt-wasting disorder characterized by hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, hypocalciuria and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Patients often present in late childhood or early adulthood with nonspecific symptoms, including muscle weakness, tetany, hypotension and fatigue. Typical complaints may also include salt craving and thirst as a reflection of salt-wasting. Gitelman syndrome is not a benign condition and may cause chondrocalcinosis due to hypomagnesemia, prolonged QTc interval and arrhythmias due to hypokalemia, glucose intolerance and immunodeficiencies. The disease was first described in 1966 by Hillel Gitelman as a subtype of Bartter syndrome. However, typical Bartter symptoms such as polyhydramnios, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, failure to thrive and an antenatal presentation are rare in Gitelman syndrome. Indeed, genetic investigations in the 1990 s revealed that Bartter and Gitelman syndrome are separate clinical entities.

Classic Gitelman syndrome is caused by biallelic mutations in solute carrier 12 subtype 3 (SLC12A3) encoding the Na⁺-Cl⁻ -co-transporter (NCC), which is exclusively expressed in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT). The NCC facilitates apical Na + and Cl − transport in the DCT and is the therapeutic target of thiazide diuretics. As a consequence of impaired NCC-mediated Na + reabsorption in the DCT, the Na + delivery to the collecting duct is increased. Accompanied by RAAS activation, the high Na + delivery results in increased K + secretion in the collecting duct explaining the hypokalemia in Gitelman patients. The metabolic alkalosis develops secondary to hypokalemia. The hypomagnesemia is less well understood (extensively reviewed in), but it is generally thought that a reduced DCT mass is a major contributor to this defect. However, human data supporting this hypothesis are scarce.

In recent years, several seminal discoveries have been made to resolve the missing heritability in Gitelman syndrome. This review, therefore, provides an overview of all known genetic causes of Gitelman-like syndromes. The differences in clinical presentation, genetic inheritance and molecular disease mechanism will be discussed.

### The neonatal variant of bartter syndrome and deafness: preservation of renal function [^112iSh96]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

A subtype of antenatal Bartter syndrome and sensorineural deafness (BSND) was originally described among families from southern Israel, and its gene (Barttin, OMIM #606412) has recently been identified. A report has suggested that these children develop chronic renal insufficiency during childhood attributable to chronic tubulointerstitial fibrosis and atrophy.

Methods

Data from 13 infants with BSND, who were born during a 20-year period in our institution, were retrospectively analyzed.

Results

All pregnancies were complicated by polyhydramnion and premature birth. All patients have sensorineural deafness, as well as hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis. Persistent hypercalciuria or nephrocalcinosis were absent in most children. All children have been treated with indomethacin (2 mg/kg/d) and potassium supplementation. The current average serum creatinine and calculated creatinine clearance from the older group (n = 8; mean age: 8.8 ± 1.4 years) is 60.8 ± 16.5 micro mol/L and 95 ± 20 mL/min/1.73 m², respectively. Kidney biopsies from two 7-year-old patients revealed mild focal tubulointerstitial fibrosis and minimal mesangial proliferation but no glomerulosclerosis.

Conclusions

Early renal function deterioration is not a uniform finding among children with BSND mutations.

### An improved terminology and classification of bartter-like syndromes [^114uNrFe]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2008). Medium credibility.

This Review outlines a terminology and classification of Bartter-like syndromes that is based on the underlying causes of these inherited salt-losing tubulopathies and is, therefore, more clinically relevant than the classical definition. Three major types of salt-losing tubulopathy can be defined: distal convoluted tubule dysfunction leading to hypokalemia (currently known as Gitelman or Bartter syndrome), the more-severe condition of polyuric loop dysfunction (often referred to as antenatal Bartter or hyperprostaglandin E syndrome), and the most-severe condition of combined loop and distal convoluted tubule dysfunction (antenatal Bartter or hyperprostaglandin E syndrome with sensorineural deafness). These three subtypes can each be further subdivided according to the identity of the defective ion transporter or channel: the sodium-chloride cotransporter NCCT or the chloride channel ClC-Kb in distal convoluted tubule dysfunction; the sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter NKCC2 or the renal outer medullary potassium channel in loop dysfunction; and the chloride channels ClC-Ka and ClC-Kb or their beta-subunit Barttin in combined distal convoluted tubule and loop dysfunction. This new classification should help clinicians to better understand the pathophysiology of these syndromes and choose the most appropriate treatment for affected patients, while avoiding potentially harmful diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

### Parathyroid hormone and phosphate homeostasis in patients with bartter and gitelman syndrome: an international cross-sectional study [^1143ecdv]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

KEY LEARNING POINTS

What is already known about this subject?

– High parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels have been observed in patients with Bartter syndrome in small cohort studies.
– In patients with Gitelman syndrome, low serum phosphate levels have anecdotally been reported.
– Data from large cohort studies on PTH and phosphate homeostasis in Bartter and Gitelman syndrome are lacking.

What this study adds?

– Up till now, this is the largest cohort of patients with salt-losing tubulopathies reported, comprising 285 patients with Bartter syndrome and 304 patients with Gitelman syndrome.
– Elevated PTH is frequently observed in patients with Bartter syndrome, especially in type I and II.
– In a significant number of patients with Bartter and Gitelman syndrome low serum phosphate was reported and is most likely related to a primarily PTH-independent renal phosphate leak.

What impact this may have on practice or policy?

– This study provides unique insights into the prevalence of aberrant PTH and phosphate homeostasis in patients with Bartter and Gitelman syndrome.
– Further studies are necessary to understand the pathophysiology of these abnormalities and to demonstrate whether PTH and/or phosphate should be a treatment target in these salt-losing tubulopathies.

### Characteristics of electrolyte imbalance and pseudo-bartter syndrome in hospitalized cystic fibrosis children and adolescents [^115TggEy]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pseudo-Bartter syndrome (PBS) is a rare manifestation of Cystic fibrosis (CF) and can often be the initial presentation in these patients, however, due to significantly overlapping symptoms it is often misdiagnosed as simple dehydration or Bartter syndrome. The objective of our study was to highlight the key features of PBS and electrolyte imbalance in CF patients helping in early and prompt diagnosis.

Method

We performed a retrospective study from January 2015 to December 2019 at the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH), Pakistan. CF patients aged from 1–18 years, admitted at AKUH were enrolled and their laboratory data and individual charts were reviewed. Patients were categorized into three groups based on their serum electrolyte profile and their clinical findings were compared.

Result

We enrolled 72 CF patients, out of which 42 (58%) were categorized into the Normal Electrolyte (NE) group, 19 (26%) into the Electrolyte Imbalance (EI) group and 11 (15%) in the PBS group. Out of 11 cases, 6 (54.54%) patients in PBS group presented with features consistent with PBS leading to CF diagnosis labeled as "early presenters". Mean age of patients in the PBS group was 3.81 ± 0.86 years and their age at diagnosis were significantly lower as compared to other groups. Gastrointestinal disturbances including diarrhea, vomiting and constipation were more common in the EI and PBS groups. Polyuria was most common in the PBS (72%) group. Length of hospital stay showed no significant difference.

Conclusion

Pseudo-Bartter syndrome can be a presenting feature of cystic fibrosis. Electrolyte imbalance should be anticipated in hospitalized CF children and adolescent.

### Parathyroid hormone and phosphate homeostasis in patients with bartter and gitelman syndrome: an international cross-sectional study [^114icr7U]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Another noteworthy finding in our cohort was that 20% of patients with Gitelman syndrome had hypoparathyroidism. The calcium-sensing receptor signalling is known to be dependent on extracellular magnesium levels. Unlike calcium, PTH secretion is inhibited by supraphysiologically high magnesium levels via stimulation of the calcium-sensing receptor, but also by low magnesium concentrations. This latter response is suggested to result from intracellular disinhibition of G-protein signalling downstream from the calcium-sensing receptor, precluding PTH release. Accordingly, decreased PTH secretion and decreased responsiveness of PTH to ionized calcium have been suggested in small cohorts of patients with Gitelman syndrome. In agreement with these data, we observed a significant correlation between PTH and serum magnesium in patients with Gitelman syndrome, suggesting that low serum magnesium might be, at least in part, responsible for hypoparathyroidism.

Hypophosphatemia was common in all disease subgroups, in particular in Bartter syndrome type III with a prevalence of 32%. The prevalence of hypophosphatemia in Bartter syndrome type III patients decreased in adulthood to 5%. In Gitelman syndrome, the prevalence of hypophosphatemia was not age-dependent. Low serum phosphate levels were associated with lower TmP/GFR in all subgroups, indicating that hypophosphatemia was most likely related to renal phosphate wasting. However, renal hypophosphatemia did not appear to be driven by hyperparathyroidism, since PTH did not correlate with phosphate-SDS or TmP/GFR-SDS. Furthermore, patients with Gitelman syndrome did not have high PTH levels, while they often had hypophosphatemia and renal phosphate wasting. The exact mechanism(s) of hypophosphatemia in these patients remains unclear. Notably, low serum phosphate levels have already been observed in anecdotal reports on Gitelman syndrome, including a possible link with lower renal tubular phosphate reabsorption. Interestingly, it has been hypothesized that chronic hypokalaemia can cause proximal tubular cell injury, resulting in a phosphate leak. However, serum potassium and serum phosphate were not correlated in our cohort. Furthermore, FGF23 could play a role. Interestingly, a recent study demonstrated that in the NCC knockout mouse model for Gitelman syndrome, FGF23 levels were increased. In contrast to our Gitelman cohort, these mice also showed increased PTH levels which, however, did not alter fractional phosphate excretion or serum phosphate levels.

### Clinical and genetic characteristics of diseases caused by CFTR gene mutations in 15 Chinese children: a retrospective analysis [^115jMVHs]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Study population

As shown in Table 1, a total of 15 individuals (8 males and 7 females) were submitted to this study from 14 families in Southwest China. The median age of onset was 1.00 years (IQR 0.11–5.08 years, range 0–13.17 years). The median age of diagnosis was 5.33 years (IQR 0.43–11.33, range 0.09–14.17 years).

Among the 15 patients, 9 had a confirmed diagnosis of CF (P1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10), 3 had a suspected CF diagnosis (P9,12,14), 3 had a suspected CFTR-RDs (P11,13,15). Regarding to those suspected CF or CFTR-RDs patients, additional CFTR functional tests (sweat chloride, NPD or ICM) were suggested.

Clinical characteristic and genotypes of the patients

Among the 15 patients, 11 had mainly respiratory manifestations, 3 had mainly gastrointestinal manifestations, and 1 had mainly electrolyte disorders. One patient had only respiratory manifestations, one had only liver cirrhosis, and the rest had multisystem involvement. Among those confirmed CF patients, 66.7% (6/9) had bronchiectasis, 88.9% (8/9) had malnutrition, 66.7% (6/9) had fatty stools (Table 2; Fig. 1).

### Vascular tone control in humans: insights from studies in Bartter's / Gitelman's syndromes [^1169YwRd]. Kidney International (2006). Low credibility.

Studies in patients with Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes performed in the last 10 years have provided important insights into the mechanistic details of relevant pathways of angiotensin II signaling and vascular tone regulation, therefore making these syndromes a good human model to gain insight into the mechanisms responsible for maintaining/controlling vascular tone. Extensive studies of patients with Bartter's/Gitelman's syndromes have, in fact, shown biochemical abnormalities of angiotensin II short- and long-term cell signaling, which depict a mirror image of those found in hypertension. The information obtained from the study of this human model of altered vascular tone regulation show that it can be used to gather more general data and/or confirm mechanistic details of the cellular and biochemical events involved in the pathophysiology of vascular tone control and to shed light on the multiplicity of the angiotensin II signaling-related mechanisms responsible for the pathophysiology of hypertension and its long-term complication such as cardiovascular remodeling and atherogenesis.

### Late diagnosis of congenital chloride diarrhea mimicking Hirschsprung's disease [^1158FLoo]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

At the time of admission, she had severe watery diarrhea, mild dehydration, and severe malnutrition (weight: 4700 g, < −3 standard deviation; height 63 cm, −1.22 standard deviation). Venous blood gas, serum, urine, stool electrolytes analyses, renin, and aldosterone levels were studied. The results of the patient's initial laboratory examinations are shown in Table 1.

Table 1.
The Results of the Patient's Initial Laboratory Examinations.

Bartter syndrome was excluded with inappropriate plasma renin, aldosterone levels, and low urinary electrolytes; cystic fibrosis was excluded with a normal sweat chloride level and negative genetic testing. The absence of conditions that could lead to Pseudo Bartter syndrome, such as diuretic drug use, long-term chlorine-poor diet, cyclic vomiting attacks, and long-term laxative drug use, and the exclusion of cystic fibrosis led us to consider the diagnosis of CCD. We double-checked for CCD (although the results are shown normally in the first stool sample taken from the diaper), and a second examination of the liquid stool sample was obtained by entering the rectum with a feeding tube. In this sample, stool chloride was 145.5 mmol/L, stool sodium was 107 mmol/L, stool potassium was 28 mmol/L, and stool osmolar gap was 20, supporting the diagnosis of CCD. In our patient, a heterozygous mutation detected between nucleotides 2024 and 2026 in exon 18 (c.2024_2026dup TCA) of the SLC26A3 gene that was characterized by duplication of 3 nucleotides (thymidine, cytosine, and adenine). This pathogenic mutation was also present in our patient's mother. However, a rare heterozygous mutation in the SLC26A3 (c.1954G > A), which was characterized by the replacement of a guanine by an adenine at nucleotide 1954 in exon 17, was also detected in our patient and her father.

She was primarily treated with intravenous fluids and then started on oral sodium chloride (5 mmol/kg/day), potassium chloride (2 mmol/kg/day), and lansoprazole (1 mg/kg/day). Her condition improved, and the frequency of diarrhea decreased. The patient is about to turn 3 years old, has an average weight, and takes oral supplements of sodium chloride and potassium. She regularly attends outpatient clinic appointments.

### Persistent renal dysfunction post-chemotherapy: a diagnostic conundrum in pediatric cancer survivorship-a case report [^115JXiet]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Table 2
Summary of reported cases with late-onset type II bartter syndrome

ACEI, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; CKD, chronic kidney disease; ESKD, end-stage kidney disease, NSAIDs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; MRAs, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists

The mainstay treatment of Bartter syndrome involves correcting volume depletion and electrolyte imbalances, preventing nephrocalcinosis, and avoiding nephrotoxic agents. To maintain fluid status, patients are encouraged to consume adequate amounts of water, and cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors could be considered for severe polyuria. Potassium supplementation is typically necessary to prevent severe hypokalemia, and potassium-sparing diuretics help raise serum K + levels and reverse metabolic alkalosis. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) may be used if the presence of proteinuria. We delivered oral potassium supplementation (5 mEq/kg/day) to maintain serum potassium levels, spironolactone to decrease renal K + excretion and reverse metabolic alkalosis, along with ACEI to control proteinuria. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug was discontinued due to concerns regarding advanced chronic kidney disease.

The strengths of this case report lie in its detailed description of a rare presentation of late-onset type II Bartter syndrome in a pediatric patient with a history of chemotherapy, adding to the limited literature on this topic. However, the limitations of this report include its single case nature, which may limit the generalizability of the findings, and the speculative nature of the exact mechanisms by which the identified variants and previous chemotherapy exposure contributed to the atypical presentation and rapid progression of chronic kidney disease.

This case emphasizes the need for close monitoring and management of electrolyte imbalances and renal function in pediatric cancer survivors, particularly those with a history of nephrotoxic chemotherapy. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for rare inherited renal tubular disorders when faced with persistent electrolyte abnormalities and renal dysfunction in this patient population. Early recognition and appropriate management of these conditions are crucial to prevent further kidney damage and optimize patient outcomes.

### Parathyroid hormone and phosphate homeostasis in patients with bartter and gitelman syndrome: an international cross-sectional study [^113KYRSa]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This cross-sectional study analysed PTH and phosphate homeostasis in patients with Bartter and Gitelman syndrome. We observed high PTH (> 7.0 pmol/L) in 56% of patients with type I and II disease. All disease subgroups, particularly patients with Bartter syndrome type III, had a tendency towards lower serum phosphate levels and a significant proportion of patients had overt hypophosphatemia (phosphate-SDS < −2).

To date, hyperparathyroidism in these disorders has only been described in case reports and small series. For example, Landau et al. observed high PTH levels in 10/14 patients with Bartter syndrome type II. Additional small studies did not include genetic characterization, while others included only type I and II Bartter syndrome. Owing to the large number of patients that were recruited, we were able to analyse subgroups of patients, demonstrating that hyperparathyroidism developed primarily in patients with Bartter syndrome type I and II and to a lesser degree, in patients with Bartter syndrome type III. A major confounding factor when analysing PTH levels is kidney function. To prevent overestimating hyperparathyroidism, we excluded from the analysis all patients with elevated creatinine, using a very conservative threshold. In addition, we observed no correlation between PTH and creatinine levels. We did not observe age-dependent changes in PTH.

### Understanding the mechanisms of angiotensin II signaling involved in hypertension and its long-term sequelae: insights from Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes, human models of endogenous angiotensin II signaling antagonism [^111GaNjG]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Angiotensin II (Ang II) plays a key role in hypertension, renal and cardiovascular pathophysiology via intracellular pathways that involve the activation of a multiplicity of signaling mechanisms. Although experimental and genetic animal models have been developed and used to explore Ang II signaling's role in hypertension, a complete understanding of the processes mediating Ang II signaling in hypertension in humans remains elusive. One impediment is that these animal models do not exhibit all the traits of human hypertension, making it impossible to extrapolate from them to humans. To overcome this issue, we have used patients with Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes, a human model of endogenously blunted and blocked Ang II signaling that presents a constellation of clinical findings which manifest themselves as the opposite of hypertension. This article reviews the aspects of the pathophysiology of human hypertension and its short and long term sequelae, and uses the results of our studies in Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes along with those of others to gain better insight and understanding of the role of Ang II signaling in these processes.

### Parathyroid hormone and phosphate homeostasis in patients with bartter and gitelman syndrome: an international cross-sectional study [^117Q6Nic]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

The main limitations of our study relate to the cross-sectional design and the relatively large group of Bartter NOS patients in the analysis. The cross-sectional design allowed us to assemble data on a very large number of patients to estimate the prevalence of PTH and phosphate abnormalities in these diseases. However, longitudinal follow-up of patients would provide additional information about the course of PTH and other variables throughout the years, which could have helped identify possible causal effects. Future studies should collect data at the initial presentation, thus pre-treatment and should also evaluate follow-up data of patients. An important opportunity to prospectively capture such data is by adding PTH and phosphate as variables to the ERKNet patient registry (ERKReg). The second main limitation is the relatively large group of patients with Bartter syndrome NOS, who lacked a genetic diagnosis and were diagnosed based on their phenotype. This subgroup was most likely composed of patients with mixed Bartter syndrome subtypes since their characteristics are intermediate between the type I and II and the type III subgroups. Sensitivity analyses performed removing the NOS subgroup showed that the inclusion of these patients did not modify our results.

Other limitations of our study are related to its retrospective, cross-sectional and multicentric design. The number of variables that could be reliably captured in the database was therefore limited. For example, active vitamin D, ionized calcium, cyclic AMP, FGF-23, aldosterone levels and data on bone metabolism were not available for most patients but could have been very instrumental in understanding the physiopathology of our findings. Treatments were decided by local physicians according to local protocols. Laboratory values were measured in different laboratories, which may have used slightly different methods and reference values. These latter aspects were probably well compensated for by the large size of our cohort. Since the age range of our patients spanned from small children to late adulthood, some values had to be normalized for age using reference data from the literature. This may have introduced some distortions in our data.

In conclusion, this cross-sectional study demonstrates that PTH is frequently elevated in patients with Bartter syndrome, especially in those with type I and II disease. The cause of hyperparathyroidism in this population remains unclear. Hypophosphatemia was observed in a significant proportion of patients with Bartter and Gitelman syndrome and appeared to be primarily related to a PTH-independent renal phosphate leak. Further studies are needed to understand better the pathophysiology and the clinical relevance of these observations.

### Parathyroid hormone and phosphate homeostasis in patients with bartter and gitelman syndrome: an international cross-sectional study [^112Qaq6T]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

We also observed significantly higher serum calcium levels in patients with Bartter syndrome, compared to patients with Gitelman syndrome. Theoretically, since patients with Gitelman syndrome have hypocalciuria, they are expected to have higher serum calcium levels than patients with Bartter syndrome that have hypercalciuria. Furthermore, compared to healthy controls, patients with Gitelman syndrome have higher serum calcium levels and patients with Bartter syndrome tend to have lower serum calcium levels. Vitamin D supplementation may have influenced our results. Although supplements were prescribed more frequently to patients with Bartter syndrome, patients treated with vitamin D did not have significantly higher serum calcium levels, compared to non-supplemented patients.

Whether in clinical practice hyperparathyroidism and hypophosphatemia require further diagnostic evaluation and treatments is unclear. In our cohort, high PTH was associated with higher alkaline phosphatase levels. This is likely due to increased bone turnover. Reduced bone mineral density has previously been observed in patients with Bartter syndrome. It may therefore be appropriate that Bartter syndrome patients undergo a regular assessment of their bone density to detect incipient osteopenia or osteoporosis, particularly if they have high PTH. Since vitamin D deficiency stimulates PTH secretion, supplements could be prescribed in patients with low vitamin D levels, keeping in mind that they may worsen hypercalciuria in patients with Bartter syndrome. Of note, 25-OH vitamin D concentrations are usually normal in patients with Bartter syndrome, while high levels of 1,25-OH vitamin D have been reported. The use of calcimimetics in patients with hyperparathyroidism associated with Bartter syndrome has been described in five patients. In four of them, PTH levels normalized. However, all had high-normal or even high serum calcium levels. In theory, normocalcemic patients with Bartter syndrome could be at increased risk of developing symptomatic hypocalcemia if treated with calcimimetics, since they have metabolic alkalosis, which decreases the proportion of ionized calcium. It is unknown whether hypophosphatemia, especially if associated with bone changes, should be treated with phosphate supplementation.

The discovery that mutations in MAGED2 cause a rare and transient form of antenatal Bartter's Syndrome may have implications beyond the very small number of affected families.

### A physiologic-based approach to the evaluation of a patient with hyperkalemia [^114dKtnY]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia generally is attributable to cell shifts or abnormal renal potassium excretion. Cell shifts account for transient increases in serum potassium levels, whereas sustained hyperkalemia generally is caused by decreased renal potassium excretion. Impaired renal potassium excretion can be caused by a primary decrease in distal sodium delivery, a primary decrease in mineralocorticoid level or activity, or abnormal cortical collecting duct function. Excessive potassium intake is an infrequent cause of hyperkalemia by itself, but can worsen the severity of hyperkalemia when renal excretion is impaired. Before concluding that a cell shift or renal defect in potassium excretion is present, pseudohyperkalemia should be excluded.

### Contradiction between genetic analysis and diuretic loading test in type I bartter syndrome: a case report [^117KeYte]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Bartter syndrome (BS) and Gitelman syndrome (GS) are closely related diseases involving congenital kidney tubular dysfunction characterized by volume depletion, hypokalaemia, and metabolic alkalosis. Owing to recent advances in genetic analysis, the classic classification of BS types, based on clinical symptoms and course, has been superseded by a classification of I to V types, depending on the responsible genes. However, a certain latitude is observed in phenotypes even within the same genotype and no one-to-one correspondence has been found between type and clinical manifestation. In typical cases of BS, assessing response to diuretics (furosemide and thiazide), hereinafter referred to as diuretic loading test, may be used to diagnose the type by detecting which part of the kidney tubule is not functioning correctly. However, such tests may not always correspond to the results of genetic analyses. We describe a case of BS diagnosed as type I through genetic analysis that produced a diuretic loading test result apparently inconsistent with this diagnosis.

### Bartter syndrome as natural experiment if furosemide (re) opens the ductus arteriosus [^116PDe2s]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Impact

Furosemide increases renal prostaglandin synthesis and animal studies show reopening of the ductus arteriosus in rats exposed to furosemide. Nevertheless, large cohort studies in preterm infants do not support this hypothesis. Bartter syndrome, a rare genetic renal disorder with excessive fluid and salt-loss, is similar to continuous furosemide exposure. We hypothesize that Bartter syndrome could be considered as a natural experiment. Although most infants with Bartter syndrome are born prematurely, there are no cases found in literature with a patent ductus arteriosus which suggest that the contribution of furosemide to (re)opening of the ductus arteriosus in humans might be negligible.

### Pseudo-bartter syndrome as the initial presentation of cystic fibrosis in children: an important diagnosis not to be missed [^1143JZm6]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Pseudo-Bartter syndrome (PBS) is characterised by hyponatraemic, hypochloraemic metabolic alkalosis that mimics Bartter syndrome, without renal tubular disease. We present a case of an infant with a positive cystic fibrosis (CF) newborn screening, hospitalised during the summer with dehydration, oliguria and apathy. Blood analysis revealed hypochloraemic metabolic alkalosis, hypokalaemia and hyponatraemia. Urine analysis showed leucocyturia with reduced sodium and chloride excretion fraction, and urinary culture was positive for Citrobacter koseri After antibiotherapy and intravenous rehydration with additional supplementation of sodium and chloride, the patient recovered completely. PBS is one of CF complications that is especially prevalent in infants and young children with increased sweating and/or other causes of additional loss of sodium and chloride. Clinical awareness of this syndrome and its strong clinical suspicion are extremely important for an early diagnosis and treatment of CF, particularly in countries where the universal screening of CF is not routinely performed.

### Metabolic alkalosis pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment: core curriculum 2022 [^114bcob6]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

The patient in case 3 exhibits signs of volume depletion, along with hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. In addition, she displays inability to conserve chloride. Common causes of volume contraction with metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia include vomiting, excessive use of loop or thiazide diuretics, or an inordinate consumption of laxatives. It can also be caused by genetic disorders such as congenital chloride-losing diarrhea, Gitelman syndrome, or Bartter syndrome. This patient does not fit into any of these categories. Loss of electrolytes in sweat, specifically in hot weather, can lead to significant volume depletion and RAAS activation, leading to hypokalemia and alkalosis. The urine chloride in nonrenal causes of volume depletion and metabolic alkalosis should be very low. However, the urine chloride in this patient is elevated, meaning option (a) is not correct for Question 6.

Salt wasting due to excessive consumption of electrolyte-containing solutions should not lead to volume depletion and metabolic alkalosis, so option (b) is not correct. This patient's history did not support the presence of respiratory acidosis before or on admission, and she was not treated for it before the admission to the hospital, ruling out option (c).

Recent studies have identified kidney-specific mechanisms that contribute to the generation of metabolic alkalosis in the setting of volume contraction. These reports demonstrated that pendrin, which is critical to Cl⁻ absorption (and HCO₃⁻ secretion) by B-intercalated cells in volume-depleted states, is profoundly downregulated in cystic fibrosis. a Pendrin downregulation impairs the ability of the kidney collecting duct to absorb salt and enhance HCO₃⁻ secretion (Fig 1). This further exacerbates the magnitude of volume contraction and metabolic alkalosis due to renal Cl⁻ loss and impaired HCO₃⁻ secretion into the collecting duct, respectively. The loss of Cl⁻ in the urine consequent to the inactivation of pendrin in the setting of volume depletion mimics a pseudo-Bartter picture, which has been described in cystic fibrosis patients, thus option (d) is the best answer to Question 6. The patient was admitted for the evaluation and treatment of hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis with volume contraction, and received 6 liters of saline along with 120 mEq of KCl over 48 hours. She was discharged with a serum HCO₃⁻ of 27 and K⁺ of 3.8 mEq/L, and a venous blood gas of 7.41.

### Severe edema after cessation of laxative abuse and use of a loop diuretic: case report [^112QiKyV]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Stimulant laxatives are the class of laxatives most often abused by patients with eating disorders. The abrupt cessation of high-dose stimulant laxatives is known to cause edema. We present the case of a patient with anorexia nervosa with binge-purge subtype who was taking ∼100 stimulant laxatives per day. Upon discontinuation of stimulant laxatives, she experienced severe peripheral edema with rapid gain of 11.6 kg over 1 week. Unique features of this case include the high quantity of stimulant laxatives consumed per day, the amount of weight gained due to edema, and the 3 month duration of edema after laxative cessation. This case report details the time course of development of edema after abrupt laxative cessation. It also details the dosing and duration of furosemide used for diuresis in order to provide a precedent to inform future care. This case calls into question the best treatment approach for patients with severe edema after laxative cessation who do not meet criteria for Pseudo Bartter syndrome.

### Epidemiology and health-related quality of life in hypoparathyroidism in Norway [^111Zfy84]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Primary hypoparathyroidism (HP) is caused by a group of heterogeneous diseases in which hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia occur as a result of insufficient PTH secretion or receptor dysfunction in target organs. The most common etiologies among adults are surgical damage to the parathyroid glands. Nonsurgical HP can be either autoimmune or genetic (Table 1), but in many cases the cause remains unknown, and is referred to as idiopathic HP.

Table 1.
Causes of Hypoparathyroidism

Epidemiological studies on HP are sparse and mostly cover certain subgroups. In Denmark, the prevalence of postsurgical HP was 220 per million inhabitants, nonsurgical HP 23 per million, and pseudohypoparathyroidism (PTH resistance; pseudo-HP) 11 per million, totaling 254 per million. An estimate among insured people from the United States revealed that about 77 000 have chronic HP of all causes, which translates into an approximate prevalence of 250 per million. In Japan and Israel, the prevalence numbers of idiopathic HP were 7 and 9 per million, respectively, and of pseudo-HP in Japan 3 per million.

Patients with pseudo-HP and vitamin D resistance have elevated PTH, in contrast to classical HP. The clinical picture in pseudo-HP and vitamin D resistance is equal to other forms of HP and is therefore included as a subgroup of HP. Autosomal dominant hypocalcemia (ADH) is probably the most common genetic cause of HP, usually caused by an activating mutation in the calcium-sensing receptor (CASR), termed ADH type 1, or rarely in guanine nucleotide binding protein, alpha 11 (GNA11), termed ADH type 2. Occasionally, CASR mutations induce polyuria and hypokalemic alkalosis, called ADH with mild Bartter syndrome type 5. The severity of ADH is highly variable, and asymptomatic patients and those who exhibit mild symptoms can often go undiagnosed.

Autoimmune HP is mainly seen as part of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS-1), in which it is present in about 80%. About one-half of the APS-1 patients with HP have autoantibodies against NACHT leucine-rich repeat protein 5 (NALP5), an intracellular protein with unknown function highly expressed in parathyroid tissue. Autoantibodies against interferon omega (IFN-ω) can be detected in nearly all APS-1 patients regardless of organ involvement. Autoantibodies that activate CaSR have also been described as an autoimmune cause of HP.

### Genetic testing in the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease: recommendations for clinical practice [^112jD7gh]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical benefit of genetic testing

In patients with a clinical diagnosis of tubulopathy, genetic testing establishes a precise diagnosis, which has high relevance for clinical management and prognosis and in some cases can end diagnostic odysseys. The importance in clinical management is particularly true for diseases with a perinatal presentation with life-threatening situations (antenatal Bartter syndrome, type 1 pseudohypoaldosteronism, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and recessive distal renal tubular acidosis) in which an adapted treatment is necessary. Specific therapies can be proposed, such as thiazides in pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2 or amiloride in Liddle syndrome.

A precise diagnosis allows focused screening for extrarenal manifestations in some tubulopathies (Supplementary data, Table S2); important examples are sensorineural hearing loss (antenatal Bartter type 4, renal tubular acidosis, East syndrome); ocular abnormalities (FHHNC type 2, Lowe syndrome, proximal tubular acidosis); dental abnormalities (FHHNC, enamel renal syndrome); neurological manifestations (Lowe syndrome, proximal tubular acidosis, mixed tubular acidosis and East syndrome); or cutaneous and exocrine gland abnormalities (HELIX syndrome).

There are also some long-term benefits in having a definite genetic diagnosis: most of the tubulopathies affect the quality of life (e.g. failure to thrive and severe polyuria in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus) and close follow-up is important, particularly in children. For diseases with an evolution towards CKD (e.g. Dent disease and FHHNC), the introduction of nephroprotective therapy is crucial. Even for diseases with a relatively good prognosis, such as Gitelman syndrome, genetic confirmation could be helpful to guide care and to survey and prevent specific chronic complications such as chondrocalcinosis.

Genetic counselling

For families with hereditary tubulopathies, genetic counselling is important to evaluate the risk for future pregnancies and support decision making concerning prenatal or pre-implantation testing when indicated. For X-linked diseases, genetic counselling and screening allow the identification of female carriers, which can provide information for reproductive decision making and neonatal management (e.g. nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and Dent disease).

In some genetic diseases, such as FHHNC and infantile hypercalcaemia or hypophosphataemic rickets with hypercalciuria, heterozygous relatives could develop hypercalciuria and nephrolithiasis. Finally, a reliable diagnosis is crucial to evaluate the eligibility of living kidney donors.

### Colistimethate (coly-mycin) [^112EH5sv]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Maximum daily dose calculated from colistin base activity should not exceed 5 mg/kg/day with normal renal function.

Transient neurological disturbances may occur. These include circumoral paresthesia or numbness, tingling or formication of the extremities, generalized pruritus, vertigo, dizziness, and slurring of speech. For these reasons, patients should be warned not to drive vehicles or use hazardous machinery while on therapy. Reduction of dosage may alleviate symptoms. Therapy need not be discontinued, but such patients should be observed with particular care.

Nephrotoxicity can occur and is probably a dose-dependent effect of colistimethate sodium. These manifestations of nephrotoxicity are reversible following discontinuation of the antibiotic.

Electrolyte and Acid/Base Abnormalities

Postmarketing cases of renal tubulopathy (i.e. Pseudo-Bartter syndrome) have been identified with the use of intravenous colistimethate sodium (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). All cases reported hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Other common findings included hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, increased potassium in the urine, normal serum creatinine, and normal blood pressure. Consider electrolyte monitoring during treatment. Normalization of electrolyte abnormalities may require drug discontinuation.

Overdosage can result in renal insufficiency, muscle weakness, and apnea (see OVERDOSAGE section). See PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions subsection for use concomitantly with other antibiotics and curariform drugs.

### Type-5 bartter syndrome presenting with metabolic seizure in adulthood [^114M5Hxi]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Bartter syndrome is a very rare and heterogeneous disease with variable age of onset and symptom severity. Genotypically they have inherited disorders of the thick ascending limb in the renal tubular system, which manifest phenotypically as electrolyte imbalance due to loss of sodium, chloride and potassium. Gain of function mutations in the calcium-sensing receptor has been described in some patients with Bartter's syndrome (type-5 Bartter syndrome or autosomal dominant hypocalcaemia with Bartter syndrome) associated with hypocalcaemia and hypercalciuria differentiating it from Gitelman syndrome. This phenotype has been reported to present in adulthood with metabolic abnormalities. We present a case of a middle-aged woman who presented with metabolic seizures and on evaluation was found to have profound electrolyte abnormalities which were corrected with supplements and led to the resolution of symptoms.

### Identification of compound mutations of SLC12A3 gene in a Chinese pedigree with gitelman syndrome exhibiting bartter syndrome-liked phenotypes [^113asEqx]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Gitelman syndrome (OMIM#263800) is an autosomal recessive inherited salt-losing renal tubular disorder. Gitelman syndrome is characterized with clinical features including hypokalemia, renal potassium wasting, metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesemia, hypocalciuria, and RAAS activation with normal blood pressure. Gitelman syndrome is associated with mutations of SLC12A3 (solute carrier family 12 member 3) gene, which locates on chromosome 16q13 and encodes the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter (NCCT) of distal convoluted tubule (DCT). Till now, there are more than 400 varieties of SLC12A3 related to Gitelman syndrome have been reported. Among those mutations, most are missense, deletion, insertion, and splice-site mutations. Most SLC12A3 mutations in Gitelman syndrome are found as simple or complex heterozygous mutations, and few of them are homozygous.

The clinical symptoms of Gitelman syndrome are variable, including muscle weakness, paresthesia, numbness, polyuria, and growth retardation in children. Some patients are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, or only exhibit non-specific fatigue, leading to the frequent misdiagnosis. Disordered renal reabsorption of sodium and chloride leads to a series of pathophysiological changes and clinical manifestations, including decreased blood volume, and activated renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS). Severe and persistent hypokalemia may lead to glucose intolerance, cardiac and renal dysfunction. Bartter syndrome is the most important genetic disorder to consider in the differential diagnosis of Gitelman syndrome, since both exhibit hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and increased plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels with normal blood pressure. Such similar phenotypes as those diseases share can make differential diagnose challenging; however, urinary calcium excretion is often considered to be an important clue to distinguish these two disorders.

In this study, we reported a Chinese familial Gitelman syndrome, and identified compound mutations of SLC12A3 with c.433C > T (p. Arg145Cys), c.1077C > G (p. Asn359Lys), and c.1666C > T (p. Pro556Ser). The proband presented hypercalciuria and renal calcification, exhibiting Bartter syndrome-like biochemical phenotypes. Further analysis of genotype-phenotype correlation analysis is needed to provide deeper insights into Gitelman syndrome.

### Late diagnosis of congenital chloride diarrhea mimicking Hirschsprung's disease [^115keUjH]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Congenital chloride diarrhea (CCD, OMIM 214700) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the SLC26A3 gene (SLC26A3; OMIM *126650), which encodes a protein that exchanges chloride and bicarbonate on enterocyte apical surface. Patients usually have a history of antenatal polyhydramnios and may experience dilated intestinal loops, watery stool, dehydration, hypochloremic hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, and high fecal chloride excretion. The presence of abdominal distention, absence of meconium, and enlarged intestinal loops may lead to misdiagnosis of meconium ileus or Hirschsprung's disease, resulting in unnecessary surgical procedures. However, patients with CCD may also be misdiagnosed as Bartter and Pseudo Bartter syndrome due to the similar laboratory findings.

### Parathyroid hormone and phosphate homeostasis in patients with bartter and gitelman syndrome: an international cross-sectional study [^1115BzMN]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypophosphatemia (phosphate-SDS < −2) was observed in 22% of patients (Supplementary data, Table S9). The prevalence of hypophosphatemia was 19% in patients with Bartter syndrome type I and II, 32% in patients with Bartter syndrome type III, and 16% in patients with Gitelman syndrome. Patients with hypophosphatemia had higher serum calcium and lower TmP/GFR-SDS (Supplementary data, Table S10). Phosphate-SDS correlated with TRP (r s = 0.201; p = 0.004) and with TmP/GFR-SDS (r s = 0.699; P < .001) (Supplementary data, Table S11). To exclude an effect of age and/or the necessary modulation of serum phosphate to SDS score to be able to compare paediatric age groups and adults, we also evaluated serum phosphate only in adults. Hypophosphatemia was observed in 14.3% of adult patients (Supplementary data, Table S12). The prevalence of hypophosphatemia was 7% in patients with Bartter syndrome type I and II, 5% in patients with Bartter syndrome type III, and 15% in patients with Gitelman syndrome. However, patient numbers in the Bartter subtype groups were low.

We finally performed a sensitivity analysis, demonstrating that the overall results of Bartter patients were not significantly influenced by the inclusion of the Bartter syndrome NOS cohort (data not shown). Overall, patients included in the NOS subgroup tended to resemble more patients with type I and II Bartter syndrome, especially if they had elevated PTH.

### Pathophysiology of antenatal Bartter's syndrome [^114Rac1T]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Antenatal Bartter syndrome (aBS) is a heterogenous disease resulting from defective ion transport in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. Novel insights into the pathophysiology, as well as the recent identification of a novel genetic cause of aBS, merit an update on this topic.

Recent Findings

In aBS, severe salt losing is further aggravated by defective salt sensing in the macula densa, where a reduced tubular salt concentration is perceived and glomerular filtration is increased instead of decreased. As patients with aBS come of age, there is an increased incidence of proteinuria and impaired renal function. Moreover, we recently reported a new form of aBS. Indeed, we described a series of nine families in whom pregnancies with male fetuses where complicated by acute polyhydramnios, preterm delivery and with severe but transient polyuria. We identified mutations in melanoma-associated antigen D2 in all study participants and showed, in vivo and in vitro, reduced expression of the furosemide and thiazide sensitive transporters sodium-potassium-2-chloride cotransporter and sodium chloride cotransporter, respectively.

Summary

Genetic studies revealed the complexity of ion transport in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle and will help to clarify the pathophysiology, which is essential to design new therapies.

### Association between activating mutations of calcium-sensing receptor and Bartter's syndrome [^1149qGoL]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

Bartter's syndrome is a heterogeneous disorder characterised by deficient renal reabsorption of sodium and chloride, and hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis with hyper-reninaemia and hyperaldosteronaemia. Mutations in several ion transporters and channels have been associated with the pathogenesis of Bartter's syndrome. We describe two hypocalcaemic patients with deficient parathyroid hormone secretion who also showed characteristics of Bartter's syndrome. We found activating mutations of the gene for the calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) in both patients. Activation of this calcium-sensing receptor inhibits the activity of a renal outer-medullary potassium channel that is mutated in type 2 Bartter's syndrome. We therefore suggest that some activating mutations of CASR could provide new mechanisms for the development of Bartter's syndrome.

### Contradiction between genetic analysis and diuretic loading test in type I bartter syndrome: a case report [^115WKiXb]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In typical cases of Bartter syndrome (BS), assessing response to diuretics (furosemide and thiazide), hereinafter referred to as diuretic loading test, may be used to diagnose the type by detecting which part of the kidney tubule is not functioning correctly. However, the diuretic loading test may not always agree with the results of genetic analyses.

Case presentation

A 5-year-old boy was admitted due to lower extremity weakness and abnormal gait. He had a recurrent episode of muscle weakness and laboratory results showed severe hypokalemia. The direct genomic sequencing of the case revealed a new mutation in the SLC12A1 gene, which is associated with type I Bartter syndrome. Because there was the difference between the phenotype and genotype, we conducted a diuretic loading test to confirm the diagnosis. However, the results showed a clear increase in urine excretion of Na and Cl. These results were not consistent with typical type I BS, but consistent with the patient's phenotype.

Conclusion

The diuretic loading test has limited utility for diagnosis especially in atypical cases. On the other hand, this test, which allows assessment of channel function, is useful for better understanding of the genotype-phenotype correlation.

### Parathyroid hormone and phosphate homeostasis in patients with bartter and gitelman syndrome: an international cross-sectional study [^113U5WMJ]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Overall characteristics

After excluding subjects with incomplete data, with serum creatinine above the threshold, or underpowered subgroups of patients, 589 patients from the original 770 patients collected were included for analysis (Figure 1).

Patient characteristics are in agreement with the known phenotypic characteristics of the diseases and are detailed in Table 1. The median age was 16.6 years (IQR 8.2–33.5). Patients with Bartter syndrome were significantly younger than patients with Gitelman syndrome [median age 9.5 years (3.5–16.3) versus 28.8 years (16.4–43.9) respectively; P < .001). Sex distribution was not significantly different in the four subgroups (P = 0.113). Overall, 52% of the patients were female. Nephrocalcinosis was reported more frequently in patients with Bartter syndrome type I and II compared to type III, with a prevalence of 89 and 18% respectively and very rarely in patients with Gitelman syndrome, as expected. On average, patients with Bartter syndrome had higher urinary calcium/creatinine ratios than Gitelman patients (P < .001) and patients with Gitelman syndrome had lower serum magnesium levels than patients with Bartter syndrome (P < .001). Indomethacin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were prescribed more often to patients with Bartter syndrome than Gitelman syndrome (P < .001).

### Autopsy report on pseudo-bartter syndrome with renal calcification induced by diuretics and diet pills [^1133Geru]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

A woman in her mid-forties had repeated vomiting and diarrhoea accompanied by muscle weakness soon after she started taking seven different diet pills imported from Thailand. After she had taken the pills for 8 days, respiratory depression progressed rapidly to arrest. Blood tests at the Emergency Department showed severe hypokalaemia with metabolic alkalosis. We diagnosed that she had developed pseudo-Bartter syndrome from the findings based on ionic abnormalities and high renin and aldosterone levels, and hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular apparatus. A postmortem blood analysis indicated subtherapeutic levels of furosemide. We concluded that the patient died from pseudo-Bartter syndrome, which was triggered by chronic self-administration of furosemide and aggravated by the diet pills. This is the first pseudo-Bartter syndrome autopsy report to show histological localisation of calcification in the kidneys.

### Bartter syndrome [^114MMbns]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review describes recent advances in our understanding of the genetic heterogeneity, pathophysiology and treatment of Bartter syndrome, a group of autosomal recessive disorders that are characterized by markedly reduced or absent salt transport by the thick ascending limb of Henle. Consequently, individuals with Bartter syndrome exhibit renal salt wasting and lowered blood pressure, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis and hypercalciuria with a variable risk of renal stones.

Recent Findings

Previously, three genes (SLC12A2, the sodium-potassium-chloride co-transporter; KCNJ1, the ROMK potassium ion channel; ClC-Kb, the basolateral chloride ion channel) had been identified as causing antenatal and 'classic' Bartter syndrome. Two additional genes have now been identified. Barttin is a beta-subunit that is required for the trafficking of CLC-K (both ClC-Ka and ClC-Kb) channels to the plasma membrane in both the thick ascending limb and the marginal cells in the scala media of the inner ear that secrete potassium ion-rich endolymph. Loss-of-function mutations in barttin thus cause Bartter syndrome with sensorineural deafness. In addition, severe gain-of-function mutations in the extracellular calcium ion-sensing receptor can result in a Bartter phenotype because activation of this G protein-coupled receptor inhibits salt transport in the thick ascending limb (a furosemide-like effect).

Summary

Five genes have been identified as causing Bartter syndrome (types I-V), with the unifying pathophysiology being the loss of salt transport by the thick ascending limb. Phenotypic differences in Bartter types I-V relate to the specific physiological roles of the individual genes in the kidney and other organ systems.

### Genetic testing in the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease: recommendations for clinical practice [^116oTZjz]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

TUBULOPATHIES

The term tubulopathies refers to abnormalities of proteins involved directly or indirectly in epithelial transport along the renal tubules. They have an important role in body homeostasis, adjusting the reabsorption and secretion of water and solutes. Inherited tubulopathies cover a group of abnormalities with several modes of inheritance, a variable presentation (in terms of age and severity) and often substantial clinical and biological overlap. They are more frequently diagnosed in children than in adults, particularly those with autosomal recessive transmission. In a recent European collaborative study, hereditary disorders accounted for 64% and 29% of cases of paediatric and adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of tubulopathy, respectively. To date, > 60 genes have been linked to tubulopathies (Supplementary data, Table S2). Most of the encoded proteins are directly responsible for the reabsorption or secretion of solutes and water (transporters, pumps or channels), which could be transepithelial or paracellular [e.g. renal hypophosphataemia, Bartter syndrome types 1–3, familial hypomagnesaemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis (FHHNC), distal renal tubular acidosis and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus]. Other proteins regulate the expression or activity of transporters, pumps or channels (e.g. Bartter syndrome types 4a and 5, pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2 and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus) and others take part in intracellular processes such as endocytosis (Dent disease).

Some metabolic diseases have been included in this group because they have a tubulopathy as the first manifestation (e.g. De Toni–Debré–Fanconi syndrome in cystinosis or nephrocalcinosis in hyperoxaluria).

### Perioperative apnea in infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: a systematic review [^111igKKg]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

All described infants with preoperative apnea, except one, had moderate to severe hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis. Several dated human and animal studies have shown compensatory hypoventilation in metabolic alkalosis. 12, 13, 28, 29, 30 This in line with more recent reports of infants with apnea caused by severe metabolic alkalosis due to (pseudo‐) Bartter syndrome, peritoneal dialysis with bicarbonate containing solutions, and consumption of gripe water, containing an high concentration of sodium bicarbonate by a previously healthy infant. 31, 32, 33, 34 In infants with postoperative apnea, it was unclear whether the infants presented with metabolic alkalosis or not and whether this may have led to postoperative apnea. 22, 23 Moreover, one infant had hypothermia and one an abnormal response to 17% inspired oxygen challenge 9 days after surgery. 13 Although the authors stated that these conditions did not contribute to the apneic episodes and that they have ruled out other contributing factors, in our view this might have played a role. In all studies, it was unclear when metabolic and electrolyte derangements were considered as corrected and infants underwent surgery. In case of insufficient correction of metabolic derangements, it could be still possible that metabolic alkalosis influenced the respiratory drive. It has been suggested that cerebrospinal fluid pH may be still elevated after rapid correction of serum electrolytes, which could continuously influence the respiratory drive. 13 Type of anesthetic technique or anesthetic agents may have played an important role in the occurrence of postoperative apnea as well. We could not compare general anesthesia and spinal anesthesia, because all infants underwent general anesthesia. Residual effects of anesthetic agents may have caused respiratory depression. Furthermore, it is well known that opioids can produce some respiratory depression. However, remarkably, all included cases underwent opioid‐free anesthesia.

### Metabolic alkalosis pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment: core curriculum 2022 [^111EuLrC]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Some important causes of metabolic alkalosis with variable volume status include hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, refeeding syndrome, alkali loading in individuals with reduced GFR, and nonreabsorbable anions such as penicillin and carbenicillin.

Patients suspected of having primary aldosteronism require measurements of renin and aldosterone at baseline and, if necessary, following the saline suppression test. The diagnosis of Bartter, Gitelman, cystic fibrosis, and Pendred syndromes necessitates genetic testing. Diagnosing congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 11β- or 17α-hydroxylase deficiency requires specific tests measuring the blood concentration of 11-deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, renin, and aldosterone, as well as cortisol and its 17-hydroxylated precursors.

Returning to case 2, thiazide overuse can produce hypercalcemia due to increased calcium reabsorption in the proximal tubule, but will also cause other electrolyte disturbances such as profound hypokalemia and hyponatremia, which are not observed in this patient. Further, the magnitude of hypercalcemia by thiazides is not expected to exceed levels above 14 mg/dL. Thus, option (a) is not the correct answer to Question 3.

Because the patient's PTH level is borderline low, primary hyperparathyroidism as a cause of hypercalcemia is unlikely. Further, a majority of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism develop nongap metabolic acidosis due to the direct inhibitory effects of PTH on proximal tubule function, hence option (b) is not correct. In hypercalcemia caused by granulomatous diseases such as sarcoidosis, vitamin D levels are significantly increased, which is not the case in this patient; thus, option (c) is not correct. Because the PTH-related peptide levels are undetectable, option (e) is incorrect.

The patient's findings of hypercalcemia (PTH-independent), metabolic alkalosis, and decreased kidney function are most likely caused by calcium alkali (milk alkali) syndrome. This condition is triggered by the ingestion of calcium along with an absorbable alkali. The disease was initially described in patients treated for peptic ulcer disease who used milk and sodium bicarbonate for symptomatic relief, but the current dominant etiology is associated with the use of over-the-counter calcium-containing medications for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis or heartburn. Because of the change in the causative agents over the years, several scholars have suggested changing the name to calcium-alkali syndrome to accurately reflect the current pathogenesis of this disorder. Thus, the correct answer to Question 3 is (d).

### Contradiction between genetic analysis and diuretic loading test in type I bartter syndrome: a case report [^117Dmw8D]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

We had experienced a case of genetically type I BS, but the clinical phenotype was mild, and the diuretic loading test results reflected the clinical phenotype. In some atypical cases of BS, the genotype may appear to diverge from the phenotype. For instance, in this case, the diuretic loading test was unable to confirm the results of genetic analysis with regard to BS type. Type I BS (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man [OMIM] 601,678) is caused by a mutation in the SLC12A1 gene that encodes the apical furosemide-sensitive Na–K–2Cl cotransporter (NKCC2). In type I BS, as a result of NKCC2 damage, urine excretion of Na and Cl generally does not increase with the administration of furosemide. However, our results showed a clear increase in these markers. We reasoned that as ours was a mild case, NKCC2 dysfunction might be only partial, resulting in a modest response to furosemide. Up to now, diuretic loading tests have generally been considered useful in diagnosing type I BS. However, in fact, there have been no large-scale studies involving diuretic loading tests in patients genetically diagnosed with type I BS; therefore, the usefulness of diuretic loading tests in mild cases such as ours remains open to question.

Another reason for the discrepancy we observed between genetic and diuretic loading tests might be the lack of standard protocols and interpretation guidelines for diuretic loading tests. In many previous studies, patients preparing for such tests were administered fresh water or a dilute saline solution to ensure sufficient urinary flow. However, in our case, blood potassium levels were low, and we were concerned that the test might trigger severe hypokalaemia, so we changed the protocol to include oral administration of KCl and an infusion of electrolytes prior to the test. Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility of potassium and chloride affecting the diuretic test results. Furthermore, there are currently no clear standards for the dose of diuretics to be administered or for the definition of a reaction. We therefore need to continue gathering data on how the results of diuretic loading tests are affected by individual patient characteristics.

### X-linked transient antenatal bartter syndrome related to MAGED2 gene: enriching the phenotypic description and pathophysiologic investigation [^116ymyAw]. Genetics in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Transient Bartter syndrome related to pathogenic variants of MAGED2 is the most recently described antenatal Bartter syndrome. Despite its transient nature, it is the most severe form of Bartter syndrome in the perinatal period. Our aim was to describe 14 new cases and to try to explain the incomplete penetrance in women.

Methods

We report on 14 new cases, including 3 females, and review the 40 cases described to date. We tested the hypothesis that MAGED2 is transcriptionally regulated by differential methylation of its CpG-rich promotor by pyrosequencing of DNA samples extracted from fetal and adult leukocytes and kidney samples.

Results

Analysis of the data from 54 symptomatic patients showed spontaneous resolution of symptoms in 27% of cases, persistent complications in 41% of cases, and fatality in 32% of cases. Clinical anomalies were reported in 76% of patients, mostly renal anomalies (52%), cardiovascular anomalies (29%), and dysmorphic features (13%). A developmental delay was reported in 24% of patients. Variants were found in all regions of the gene. Methylation analysis of the MAGED2 CpG-rich promotor showed a correlation with gender, independent of age, tissue or presence of symptoms, excluding a role for this mechanism in the incomplete penetrance in women.

Conclusion

This work enriches the phenotypic and genetic description of this recently described disease and deepens our understanding of the pathophysiological role and regulation of MAGED2. Finally, by describing the wide range of outcomes in patients, this work opens the discussion on genetic counseling offered to families.

### Parathyroid hormone and phosphate homeostasis in patients with bartter and gitelman syndrome: an international cross-sectional study [^112Vk2pv]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

While Bartter and Gitelman syndromes share similarities, including hypokalaemia, metabolic alkalosis, hyperreninemic hyperaldosteronism and low/normal blood pressure, differences in the tubular segments where NaCl reabsorption is compromised produce different clinical pictures. Patients with Gitelman syndrome usually present in late childhood or early adulthood. Typically, patients with Gitelman syndrome have hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria. Conversely, type I and II Bartter syndrome patients usually present antenatally with polyhydramnios and postnatally with severe polyuria, hypercalciuria and early onset nephrocalcinosis. Patients with type III Bartter syndrome have variable phenotypes that, in some cases, are difficult to distinguish from Gitelman syndrome. The large phenotypic spectrum of Bartter III patients is most likely explained by variable expression of the pathogenic gene product in the TAL and DCT and by the possibility of partial compensation by other chloride channels, in particular, ClC-Ka in the TAL.

In recent years, several investigators have observed abnormal levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and serum phosphate in patients with Bartter and Gitelman syndrome. Patients with Bartter syndrome tend to have a high PTH. However, the prevalence and pathophysiology of hyperparathyroidism in these Bartter patients are unclear. Furthermore, data have been in part contradictory since a tendency towards both hyper- and hypophosphatemia has been described in Bartter syndrome. In patients with Gitelman syndrome, high PTH levels have only been described in patients that had parathyroid adenoma, while hypophosphatemia has been reported in several small studies and has been attributed to renal phosphate wasting.

To verify whether these observations from case reports and small series are prevalent in Bartter and Gitelman syndromes or just incidental findings, we analysed PTH and phosphate levels in a very large cross-sectional cohort of patients with Bartter and Gitelman syndrome collected across Europe, including both paediatric and adult subjects.

### Transient hyponatremia of prematurity caused by mild bartter syndrome type II: a case report [^114QReea]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Bartter syndrome was initially described in 1962 by Bartter et al. as a renal tubular disorder characterized by hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, a low or normal blood pressure and elevated renin. The hyperreninemia and hyperaldosteronism occur due to volume depletion activating the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Bartter syndrome can also involve polyuria, polydipsia, normal to increased urinary calcium excretion, normal or mildly decreased serum magnesium, and occasionally hypophosphatemia. It is categorized into five types each with specific associated mutations and clinical presentations.

Variability in Bartter syndrome presentations are seen even within subtypes. A few cases of transient Bartter syndrome have been reported with mutations located in the melanoma-associated antigen D2 (MAGE-D2) gene located on the X-chromosome. Bartter syndrome type II (MIM #241200) is caused by mutations in the renal outer medullary potassium channel (ROMK) potassium channel gene (KCNJ1) (MIM *600359), can manifest in the neonatal period with hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, and typically requires lifelong electrolyte supplementation. We are aware of a single case of transient Bartter syndrome in a preterm patient who was compound heterozygous for pathogenic variants in the KCNJ1 gene: a paternally inherited Arg338Stop variant and a maternally inherited Met357Thr variant. The patient's symptoms resolved by age three after 1 year of indomethacin treatment, possibly fitting the diagnosis of transient Bartter syndrome.

Here we describe another patient with compound heterozygous variants in the KCNJ1 gene, who exhibited the features of neonatal Bartter syndrome but showed spontaneous resolution of electrolyte abnormalities by 3 months of age while continuing to have polyuria and hypercalciuria.

### Cystic fibrosis in Turkey: first data from the national registry [^114XmxxC]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Cystic fibrosis (CF) care has been implemented in Turkey for a long time; however, there had been no patient registry. For this purpose, the Turkish National CF Registry was established. We present the first results of registry using data collected in 2017.

Methods

The data were collected using a data-entry software system, which was accessed from the internet. Demographic and annually recorded data consisted of 15 and 79 variables, respectively.

Results

There were 1170 patients registered from 23 centers; the estimated coverage rate was 30%. The median age at diagnosis was 1.7 years (median current age: 7.3 years); 51 (4.6%) patients were aged over 18 years. Among 293 patients who were under 3 years of age, 240 patients (81.9%) were diagnosed through newborn screening. Meconium ileus was detected in 65 (5.5%) patients. Genotyping was performed in 978 (87.4%) patients and 246 (25.2%) patients' mutations were unidentified. The most common mutation was deltaF508 with an allelic frequency of 28%, followed by N1303K (4.9%). The median FEV1% predicted was 86. Chronic colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa was seen in 245 patients. The most common complication was pseudo-Bartter syndrome in 120 patients. The median age of death was 13.5 years in a total of 15 patients.

Conclusions

Low coverage rate, lack of genotyping, unidentified mutations, and missing data of lung functions are some of our greatest challenges. Including data of all centers and reducing missing data will provide more accurate data and help to improve the CF care in Turkey in the future.

### Salt-losing tubulopathies in children: what's new, what's controversial? [^1166MPZ1]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Renal tubulopathies provide insights into the inner workings of the kidney, yet also pose therapeutic challenges. Because of the central nature of sodium in tubular transport physiology, disorders of sodium handling may affect virtually all aspects of the homeostatic functions of the kidney. Yet, owing to the rarity of these disorders, little clinical evidence regarding treatment exists. Consequently, treatment can vary widely between individual physicians and centers and is based mainly on understanding of renal physiology, reported clinical observations, and individual experiences. Salt-losing tubulopathies can affect all tubular segments, from the proximal tubule to the collecting duct. But the more frequently observed disorders are Bartter and Gitelman syndrome, which affect salt transport in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop and/or the distal convoluted tubule, and these disorders generate the greatest controversies regarding management. Here, we review clinical and molecular aspects of salt-losing tubulopathies and discuss novel insights provided mainly by genetic investigations and retrospective clinical reviews. Additionally, we discuss controversial topics in the management of these disorders to highlight areas of importance for future clinical trials. International collaboration will be required to perform clinical studies to inform the treatment of these rare disorders.

### Episodic seasonal pseudo-bartter syndrome in cystic fibrosis [^117UNo3b]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Pseudo-Bartter syndrome (PBS) describes an uncommon but well recognised complication of cystic fibrosis leading to hypochloraemic, hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis. Pseudo-Bartter syndrome is usually seen at initial presentation or within the first two years of life in children with cystic fibrosis. Risk factors for development of PBS include warm weather conditions, severe respiratory or pancreatic disease and gastrointestinal losses (e.g. vomiting and diarrhoea). PBS is rare in older children and adolescents although epidemics have been associated with heat wave conditions in warmer climates. In this era of climate change, it is crucial that clinicians consider Pseudo-Bartter syndrome when patients with cystic fibrosis present unwell during summer.

### Diagnosis and management of bartter syndrome: executive summary of the consensus and recommendations from the European Rare Kidney Disease Reference Network working group for tubular disorders [^111c5Vj5]. Kidney International (2021). Medium credibility.

Bartter syndrome is a rare inherited salt-losing renal tubular disorder characterized by secondary hyperaldosteronism with hypokalemic and hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis and low to normal blood pressure. The primary pathogenic mechanism is defective salt reabsorption predominantly in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. There is significant variability in the clinical expression of the disease, which is genetically heterogenous with 5 different genes described to date. Despite considerable phenotypic overlap, correlations of specific clinical characteristics with the underlying molecular defects have been demonstrated, generating gene-specific phenotypes. As with many other rare disease conditions, there is a paucity of clinical studies that could guide diagnosis and therapeutic interventions. In this expert consensus document, the authors have summarized the currently available knowledge and propose clinical indicators to assess and improve quality of care.

### Pseudo gitelman syndrome associated with pregnancy [^111Nm9CF]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Gitelman syndrome is a rare inherited renal tubulopathy associated with metabolic alkalosis and electrolyte disorders. Pseudo Gitelman syndrome presents with the same clinical characteristics as Gitelman syndrome, yet without genetic mutations in SLC12A3.

Case

A 32-year-old woman with no remarkable medical and family history developed hypokalemia at 32 weeks of gestation. Laboratory findings were consistent with Gitelman syndrome and potassium supplementation was initiated. The patient delivered a healthy neonate at 40 weeks of gestation and the electrolyte disorders drastically improved. After delivery, genomic analysis revealed no evidence of mutations in SLC12A3, and pseudo Gitelman syndrome was finally diagnosed.

Conclusion

Pseudo Gitelman syndrome, presenting with Gitelman syndrome-like renal tubulopathy without mutations in SLC12A3, can cause a temporary electrolyte imbalance based on the physiologic changes of pregnancy. Although pregnant women with isolated hypokalemia need not be evaluated for Gitelman or pseudo Gitelman syndrome, if it is accompanied by metabolic alkalosis, hypocalciuria, hypomagnesia, and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system without hypertension, this evaluation should be considered.

### Unexpected clinical sequelae of gitelman syndrome: hypertension in adulthood is common and females have higher potassium requirements [^114Crjnn]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

Symptom onset predated genetic diagnosis of GS by many years in our cohort, partly because genetic testing is a relatively recent addition to the clinician's armamentarium. Such a time lag is, however, typical in the diagnosis of rare diseases; many of our patients commented upon the relief they felt at finally reaching a definite diagnosis. Patients often retrospectively recognize symptoms stretching as far back as childhood, and the childhood preference for salty foods is a good discriminating question when eliciting the history.

Hypocalciuria has previously been used to distinguish Bartter from GS, but we did not universally find low urinary calcium levels (Table 1). Hypocalciuria in GS is thought to result from compensatory up-regulation of proximal tubular calcium re-absorption. Hence it is a consequence of impaired NCCT rather than a primary defect, and thus might be expected to vary with the degree of hypomorphism of mutant alleles.

Finally, the high frequency of hypertension that we have observed suggests that GS should be considered not only in those with unexplained hypokalaemia, but also in the differential diagnosis of hypertension associated with secondary hyperaldosteronism. Future studies will reveal if this turns out to be the case in a significant proportion of such individuals.

### Cardiovascular and arrhythmic manifestations of Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes: do not forget the heart. A narrative literature review [^113YoDda]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes (BS/GS) are genetically determined kidney tubulopathies leading to electrolyte and neurohormonal abnormalities. Although considered benign entities, major adverse cardiovascular events may complicate both syndromes, in form of ventricular arrhythmias leading to palpitations, syncope or sudden cardiac death, microvascular cardiac dysfunction and exercise-induced myocardial contractile deficit. The mechanisms leading to cardiovascular complications are not only driven by chronic electrolyte abnormalities, i.e. chronic hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, but also by neurohormonal alterations that can impair vascular tone and myocardial contractility. In presence of triggering factors, BS/GS patients may experience a spectrum of cardiac arrhythmias necessitating prompt diagnosis and treatment. The aim of this review is to explore the pathophysiological mechanisms of BS and GS, highlighting those responsible for cardiovascular involvement, and to analyze the spectrum of associated cardiovascular complications. This highlights the importance of an integrated shared management of GS/BS patients between Nephrologist and Cardiologist.

### Bartter syndrome and gitelman syndrome [^115bhrBv]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Bartter and Gitelman syndromes are conditions characterized by renal salt-wasting. Clinical presentations range from severe antenatal disease to asymptomatic with incidental diagnosis. Hypokalemic hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis is the common feature. Bartter variants may be associated with polyuria and weakness. Gitelman syndrome is often subtle, and typically diagnosed later life with incidental hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. Treatment may involve fluid and electrolyte replenishment, prostaglandin inhibition, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system axis disruption. Investigators have identified causative mutations but genotypic-phenotypic correlations are still being characterized. Collaborative registries will allow improved classification schema and development of effective treatments.

### Parathyroid hormone and phosphate homeostasis in patients with bartter and gitelman syndrome: an international cross-sectional study [^1144m3zf]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of hyperparathyroidism and phosphate homeostasis abnormalities in patients with Bartter and Gitelman syndrome. To this end, we designed a cross-sectional study, favouring collection of data on a very large number of patients, over collecting longitudinal data on fewer patients which would have been more informative on pathophysiology, but would have limited our ability to estimate disease prevalence. However, some hypotheses on the pathophysiology and possible clinical implications can be proposed and discussed.

It has previously been hypothesized that hypercalciuria, a characteristic feature of patients with Bartter syndrome type I and type II, may contribute to increased PTH secretion, as a physiological response to maintain serum calcium within the normal range despite excessive renal calcium loss. Indeed, in our whole cohort, a correlation between urinary calcium excretion and PTH was found. Calciuria is a crucial distinction between Bartter and Gitelman syndrome and our observational study cannot distinguish between a causative role of calciuria for hyperparathyroidism or a simple association because of other differences between Bartter and Gitelman syndrome. As expected, hypercalciuria was a consistent feature in patients with Bartter syndrome type I and II, but no correlation between urinary calcium excretion and PTH levels were observed in this subgroup. However, the cross-sectional design of the study and significant heterogeneity of patient treatments, do not allow excluding a possible role of hypercalciuria in promoting PTH secretion. Patients with hyperparathyroidism in this subgroup had on average lower serum calcium levels and, as expected, serum calcium was negatively correlated with PTH. These findings are concordant with the reports by Landau et al. and Bettinelli et al. The cause of this lower serum calcium and whether it is sufficient to trigger PTH secretion in these patients remains undetermined.

### PseudoBartter syndrome in eating disorders [^113Ey4rK]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

PseudoBartter's syndrome, a complex pattern of seemingly unrelated metabolic abnormalities, is frequently seen in patients with eating disorders, particularly those who indulge in purging behaviors. We present two cases that, despite divergent background histories and clinical presentations, possess the unifying pathophysiology that ultimately leads to this syndrome.

Method

Case report and review of literature pertaining to Bartter's and PseudoBartter's syndromes.

Results

Purging behaviors commonly result in a state of profound dehydration and chloride depletion that leads to the metabolic abnormalities characteristic of inheritable sodium and chloride renal tubular transport disorders. In the eating disorder patient, these abnormalities lead to a propensity towards marked edema formation.

Discussion

The metabolic and clinical manifestations of PseudoBartter's syndrome are seen more commonly than previously thought. It is important to appreciate that a complex self-perpetuating pathophysiology leads to the hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis characteristic of PseudoBartter syndrome. The metabolic abnormalities characteristic of this phenomenon should therefore be viewed in this context and the resulting predilection towards marked edema formation should be borne in mind.

### Clinical features and accompanying findings of pseudo-bartter syndrome in cystic fibrosis [^1139VgkX]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pseudo-Bartter syndrome (PBS) is a rare complication of cystic fibrosis (CF) and there are limited data in the literature about it. We aimed to compare clinical features and accompanying findings of patients with PBS in a large patient population.

Methods

The data were collected from the Cystic Fibrosis Registry of Turkey where 1170 CF patients were recorded in 2017. Clinical features, diagnostic test results, colonization status, complications, and genetic test results were compared in patients with and without PBS.

Results

Totally 1170 patients were recorded into the registry in 2017 and 120 (10%) of them had PBS. The mean age of diagnosis and current age of patients were significantly younger and newborn screening positivity was lower in patients with PBS (P < .001). There were no differences between the groups in terms of colonization status, mean z-scores of weight, height, BMI, and mean FEV 1 percentage. Types of genetic mutations did not differ between the two groups. Accompanying complications were more frequent in patients without PBS.

Conclusion

PBS was detected as the most common complication in the registry. It could be due to warm weather conditions of our country. It is usually seen in younger ages regardless of mutation phenotype and it could be a clue for early diagnosis of CF.

### Effective medical treatment strategies to help cessation of purging behaviors [^112Zuyuh]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Herein we review the major medical issues involved in the "detoxing" of patients who engage in purging behaviors and the pathophysiology of why they occur.

Methods

Given a limited evidence base of randomized controlled trials, we conducted a thorough qualitative review to identify salient literature with regard to the medical issues involved in "detoxing" patients from their purging behaviors.

Results

Pseudo Bartter's Syndrome is the root cause of much of the medical difficulties which can arise when purging behaviors are abruptly discontinued. However, this is imminently treatable and even preventable with a judicious medical treatment plan which targets the increased serum aldosterone levels which would otherwise promote salt and water retention and a propensity towards severe edema formation. Effective recommendations are provided which can make this process much less vexing for patients attempting to cease their purging behaviors.

Conclusions

"Detoxing" from purging behaviors can be fraught with medical complications which frustrate these patients and can lead to unsuccessful outcomes. Medical providers should become familiar with the pathophysiology which is the basis for Pseudo Bartter's Syndrome and the effective medical treatments which can lead to a successful outcome.

### Clinical and genetic spectrum of bartter syndrome type 3 [^113rr29e]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Bartter syndrome type 3 is a clinically heterogeneous hereditary salt-losing tubulopathy caused by mutations of the chloride voltage-gated channel Kb gene (CLCNKB), which encodes the ClC-Kb chloride channel involved in NaCl reabsorption in the renal tubule. To study phenotype/genotype correlations, we performed genetic analyses by direct sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and retrospectively analyzed medical charts for 115 patients with CLCNKB mutations. Functional analyses were performed in Xenopus laevis oocytes for eight missense and two nonsense mutations. We detected 60 mutations, including 27 previously unreported mutations. Among patients, 29.5% had a phenotype of ante/neonatal Bartter syndrome (polyhydramnios or diagnosis in the first month of life), 44.5% had classic Bartter syndrome (diagnosis during childhood, hypercalciuria, and/or polyuria), and 26.0% had Gitelman-like syndrome (fortuitous discovery of hypokalemia with hypomagnesemia and/or hypocalciuria in childhood or adulthood). Nine of the ten mutations expressed in vitro decreased or abolished chloride conductance. Severe (large deletions, frameshift, nonsense, and essential splicing) and missense mutations resulting in poor residual conductance were associated with younger age at diagnosis. Electrolyte supplements and indomethacin were used frequently to induce catch-up growth, with few adverse effects. After a median follow-up of 8 (range, 1–41) years in 77 patients, chronic renal failure was detected in 19 patients (25%): one required hemodialysis and four underwent renal transplant. In summary, we report a genotype/phenotype correlation for Bartter syndrome type 3: complete loss-of-function mutations associated with younger age at diagnosis, and CKD was observed in all phenotypes.

### Central pontine myelinolysis associated with hypokalaemia in anorexia nervosa [^116WRZqL]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

A 31-year-old man was admitted to hospital with of anorexia, binge eating, and self induced vomiting. On admission, he showed a pronounced low weight and disturbance of the body image and was diagnosed as having anorexia nervosa. In addition, electrolyte abnormalities, mainly hypokalaemia, and increased serum renin and aldosterone concentrations were recorded, suggesting pseudo-Bartter syndrome as a complication. Under frequent monitoring of the serum potassium and sodium concentrations, serum electrolytes were gradually corrected, but brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed reversible central pontine myelinolysis (CPM). Although attention has been mainly paid to the association of CPM with rapid correction of hyponatraemia and abnormal osmolality, this case report strongly suggested the involvement of hypokalaemia in the pathogenesis of CPM.

### Classic bartter syndrome: a rare cause of failure to thrive in a child [^115o7hVq]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Bartter syndrome is a group of rare autosomal-recessive disorders caused by a defect in distal tubule transport of sodium and chloride. Blood gases and plasma electrolytes raise suspicion of this diagnosis and the definitive diagnosis is made by genetic study. Early treatment improves prognosis. The authors present the case of an 11-month-old child with early failure to thrive and severe regurgitation. Blood gases revealed hypochloraemic metabolic alkalosis, hyponatraemia and hypokalaemia. Blood pressure was normal and polyuria was documented. She began therapy with potassium chloride supplementation and indomethacin. There was clinical improvement and plasma potassium and bicarbonate normalised. The molecular study confirmed it was the classic form of Bartter syndrome. Despite being rare in clinical practice, which may lead to unnecessary medical investigation and diagnosis delay, in a child with failure to thrive, hypochloraemic metabolic alkalosis and hypokalaemia, this diagnosis must be considered.

### Colistin-induced acquired bartter-like syndrome: an unusual cause of meltdown [^1167sVc5]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Colistin-induced nephrotoxicity is commonly associated with elevation of serum creatinine level or a reduction of urine output. Uncommonly, tubulopathy associated with colistin has been reported. Here we present a unique case of a 46-year-old man who developed polyuria, hypokalaemia, hypocalcaemia, hypomagnesemia and metabolic alkalosis after 3days of therapy with intravenous colistimethate sodium. After ruling out other causes, a diagnosis of colistin-induced acquired Bartter syndrome was made. The patient required daily aggressive intravenous repletion of fluids and electrolytes. However, polyuria and metabolic abnormalities abated only after drug discontinuation.

### A thiazide test for the diagnosis of renal tubular hypokalemic disorders [^112ayWDV]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

Although the diagnosis of Gitelman syndrome (GS) and Bartter syndrome (BS) is now feasible by genetic analysis, implementation of genetic testing for these disorders is still hampered by several difficulties, including large gene dimensions, lack of hot-spot mutations, heavy workup time, and costs. This study evaluated in a cohort of patients with genetically proven GS or BS diagnostic sensibility and specificity of a diuretic test with oral hydrochlorothiazide (HCT test). Forty-one patients with GS (22 adults, aged 25 to 57; 19 children-adolescents, aged 7 to 17) and seven patients with BS (five type I, two type III) were studied; three patients with "pseudo-BS" from surreptitious diuretic intake (two patients) or vomiting (one patient) were also included. HCT test consisted of the administration of 50 mg of HCT orally (1 mg/kg in children-adolescents) and measurement of the maximal diuretic-induced increase over basal in the subsequent 3 h of chloride fractional clearance. All but three patients with GS but no patients with BS and pseudo-BS showed blunted (< 2.3%) response to HCT; patients with BS and the two patients with pseudo-BS from diuretic intake had increased response to HCT. No overlap existed between patients with GS and both patients with BS and pseudo-BS. The response to HCT test is blunted in patients with GS but not in patients with BS or nongenetic hypokalemia. In patients with the highly selected phenotype of normotensive hypokalemic alkalosis, abnormal HCT test allows prediction with a very high sensitivity and specificity of the Gitelman genotype and may avoid genotyping.

### Different roles of the RAAS affect bone metabolism in patients with primary aldosteronism, gitelman syndrome and bartter syndrome [^113DQCzZ]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

This study is based on a female patient treated by us recently who had hyperparathyroidism caused by parathyroid cancer. She developed severe osteoporosis with multi-bone fractures. We measured her renin and aldosterone levels since she had hypo-potassium and normal blood pressure. Surprisingly, renin was more than 500 (normal 2.8–39.9uIU/ml) and aldosterone was also significantly increased. The blood potassium, renin and aldosterone of the patient returned to normal 1 week after the operation without other interventions. We were impressed by this strong interaction between PTH and RAAS. We wonder what PTH level and bone mineral density would be in patients with persistent disordered RAAS?

Primary aldosteronism (PA), Bartter syndrome (BS) and Gitelman syndrome (GS) are three endocrine diseases with disordered RAAS. Primary aldosteronism (PA) as primary hyperaldosteronism or Conn's syndrome, is characterized by hypertension and hypokalemia, while Bartter syndrome (BS) and Gitelman syndrome (GS) as secondary hyperaldosteronism, characterized by hypokalemia, normal to low blood pressure, and metabolic alkalosis. Hypomagnesemia is less frequent than hypercalciuria in BS, while hypomagnesemia is an essential feature of GS, accompanied by hypocalciuria. The RAAS is disordered in PA, BS and GS; however, the pathogenesis is not the same. Elevated aldosterone in PA is from the proliferation of the adrenal gland or adrenal adenoma, and the increased aldosterone in turn inhibits the secretion of renin. Renal tubular ion exchange channel mutations are found in GS and BS patients, and this may induce the proliferation of juxtaglomerular cells and the elevation of renin secretion, followed by increased aldosterone secretion.

The interaction between the components of RAAS and PTH is well reviewed in the literature. It was found that plasma aldosterone level and ARR ratio were positively associated with plasma PTH level. High plasma PTH level can inactivate the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and increase the expression of renin, which can also directly affect the synthesis and release of aldosterone in plasma. It has also been reported that a high level of aldosterone may have a negative effect on bone. However, there are few studies on whether the elevated aldosterone by different mechanisms may have the same effects on bone as PA, and whether this effect is mediated by PTH or other pathway. Therefore, we review the clinical data of Bartter and Gitelman syndrome patients and hope to answer the question.

### Parathyroid hormone and phosphate homeostasis in patients with bartter and gitelman syndrome: an international cross-sectional study [^114WboMQ]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

All disease subgroups had a negative median phosphate-SDS, demonstrating that median serum phosphate was lower in all subgroups than median age-specific serum phosphate levels (Table 1; Figure 2). Patients with Bartter syndrome type III had the lowest median phosphate-SDS of −1.34 (−2.31 to −0.15), which was significantly lower compared to phosphate-SDS in Bartter syndrome type I and II and Gitelman syndrome (P = 0.032 and P = 0.011 respectively; Figure 2). No differences were observed in tubular reabsorption of phosphate (TRP) (P = 0.254) between different disease subgroups. TmP/GFR-SDS was lowest in patients with Gitelman syndrome [−0.98 (−1.47 to −0.46); Figure 2]. This was significantly lower compared to Bartter syndrome type I and II (P = 0.006).

Median and IQR of serum calcium were within the normal range for all subgroups (Table 1; Figure 2). Serum calcium was significantly higher in patients with Bartter syndrome compared to Gitelman syndrome (P < .001). No significant differences in serum calcium were observed between Bartter syndrome subtypes.

Although data were available only in part of the entire cohort (Supplementary data, Table S2), 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25OH vitamin D) levels were lower in patients with Bartter syndrome compared to Gitelman syndrome (P = 0.001) and patients with Bartter syndrome used vitamin D supplements more often (P < .001; Table 1). No difference in serum calcium levels was found between patients who used vitamin D supplements and non-supplemented patients (data not shown).
