## Question

Morganella morganii uti in children

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Morganella morganii urinary tract infection in children, including its microbiology and resistance risks, diagnostic approach, empiric and definitive therapy, special populations, and follow-up. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the organism's clinical significance and resistance patterns. Then, I should verify the diagnostic criteria and specimen requirements in children. Next, I will consider empiric therapy choices by severity and local resistance, followed by definitive therapy once susceptibilities return. After that, I need to address special populations such as neonates, immunocompromised hosts, and those with recurrent or complicated UTI. Finally, I should confirm duration, monitoring, and when to image or involve specialists, and I will close with a concise, practical algorithm and key takeaways anchored to guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the organism and its clinical relevance. Morganella morganii is a Gram-negative, facultative anaerobic rod in the Enterobacterales, historically considered a low-virulence opportunist but increasingly recognized as a uropathogen in children, particularly in the setting of recurrent UTI, urologic abnormalities, or healthcare exposure, with rising resistance burdens documented in pediatric cohorts [^70801b9b] [^beb5af6b].

> Wait, let me verify the resistance risks before jumping to empiric choices. M. morganii possesses inducible chromosomal AmpC β-lactamase, which confers intrinsic resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and first- and second-generation cephalosporins; clinically significant AmpC derepression is less common than in Enterobacter cloacae or Citrobacter freundii, but it can emerge, so third-generation cephalosporins should be used cautiously and guided by susceptibilities when treating beyond uncomplicated cystitis [^2768bcef] [^efdc08d6]. I should also confirm that ESBL phenotypes occur and that multidrug resistance is reported in pediatric isolates, reinforcing the need to tailor therapy to culture results and local antibiograms [^beb5af6b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diagnostics. I need to ensure we apply pediatric-specific criteria. In children 2–24 months with unexplained fever, UTI is diagnosed when there is pyuria and/or bacteriuria on urinalysis plus at least 50,000 CFU/mL of a single uropathogen from a catheterized or suprapubic specimen; bagged specimens are unreliable for diagnosis due to high false-positive rates and should not be used when therapy is planned [^9270b858] [^27a3e613]. Let me double-check that both culture and urinalysis are obtained before antibiotics when feasible, because this materially changes management and follow-up decisions [^68341ed2].

> Next, I should review empiric therapy by severity and setting. For stable, non-severe presentations, oral third-generation cephalosporins such as cefixime or cefpodoxime are reasonable empiric choices given local resistance patterns, with the caveat that AmpC-mediated resistance can emerge in M. morganii; if there is a high risk of ESBL or prior resistant history, oral TMP-SMX or a fluoroquinolone may be preferred if susceptible, balancing risks and benefits in children [^f970fe5c] [^2768bcef]. For severe illness, sepsis, or inability to tolerate oral therapy, parenteral ceftriaxone or cefepime are appropriate; cefepime is preferred over ceftriaxone when AmpC risk is higher or when prior cultures suggest inducible resistance, and aminoglycosides such as amikacin are alternatives when beta-lactam resistance is a concern, particularly in recurrent or healthcare-associated infections [^2768bcef] [^75ae50f2].

> I will now examine definitive therapy once susceptibilities return. Let me think about narrowing and avoiding agents with intrinsic resistance. Ampicillin, amoxicillin, and first- and second-generation cephalosporins should be avoided given intrinsic AmpC activity; instead, choose among third-generation cephalosporins, TMP-SMX, fluoroquinolones, or carbapenems based on susceptibility and clinical context, with a strong preference for the narrowest effective agent to support stewardship [^2768bcef] [^efdc08d6]. For ESBL-producing M. morganii, TMP-SMX or a fluoroquinolone are preferred oral options if susceptible, reserving carbapenems for severe or life-threatening infections or when oral options are unsuitable, and avoiding cefepime for ESBL-E pyelonephritis or cUTI despite in vitro susceptibility due to clinical failure concerns [^868445cc] [^9c8963d8].

> But wait, what if the child is a neonate or has specific comorbidities. In neonates and infants under 2 months, I should confirm that empiric ampicillin plus gentamicin is standard to cover common pathogens and potential GBS, with adjustments once cultures and local epidemiology are known; in immunocompromised hosts or those with urologic abnormalities, I need to consider broader coverage for Pseudomonas, Enterococcus, or MRSA depending on history and presentation, and involve pediatric infectious diseases early when multidrug resistance is suspected [^ca0d435c] [^2ee308e5]. For children with recurrent UTI or on prophylaxis, I should verify that breakthrough infections warrant a different antibiotic class and reassessment of the underlying anatomy and bladder-bowel dysfunction, given the higher likelihood of resistant organisms in this group [^75ae50f2].

> I should confirm duration and the IV-to-oral switch strategy. For uncomplicated cystitis, 7–10 days is typical in children, whereas for pyelonephritis or complicated UTI, 7–14 days is recommended, with emerging data suggesting that shorter courses may be noninferior in selected children; however, I need to ensure that shorter-course evidence is extrapolated cautiously to M. morganii given limited pathogen-specific data [^aa79cd55] [^6031a15d]. If IV therapy is initiated, an early switch to oral therapy is appropriate once the child is afebrile, clinically improving, and able to tolerate oral intake, ideally after 48–72 hours of IV treatment depending on severity and response [^723dca33].

> Next, I should review follow-up and when to image. Let me verify that routine test-of-cure is not needed in asymptomatic children after appropriate therapy, but clinical reassessment at 48–72 hours is essential if symptoms persist or worsen; if there is treatment failure or atypical course, repeat urinalysis and culture, renal ultrasound, and consideration of blood cultures are indicated to evaluate for complications such as abscess or obstruction [^d49b6f40]. I need to ensure that imaging is tailored to recurrence, severity, or atypical features rather than obtained routinely after a first febrile UTI in otherwise healthy children, aligning with contemporary guidance [^fe5223d0].

> Hold on, I should verify the key takeaways and synthesize a practical approach. M. morganii is a notable uropathogen in children with rising resistance, so accurate diagnosis with catheterized or suprapubic specimens and early susceptibility testing are critical; empiric therapy should be guided by severity and local resistance, favoring third-generation cephalosporins or cefepime for severe disease and oral TMP-SMX or fluoroquinolones when appropriate and safe, with prompt de-escalation once cultures return; duration is 7–10 days for cystitis and 7–14 days for pyelonephritis or complicated UTI, with early IV-to-oral switch when stable; and persistent or recurrent infections warrant evaluation for anatomic or functional abnormalities and resistant organisms, with specialist input as needed [^2768bcef] [^723dca33] [^e8c912dd].

---

Morganella morganii UTIs in children are **uncommon but clinically significant** due to rising resistance and potential for complications [^70801b9b] [^beb5af6b]. Diagnosis relies on **catheterized or suprapubic urine culture** with pyuria and ≥ 50,000 CFU/mL of a single organism [^9270b858] [^27a3e613]. Empiric therapy should avoid ampicillin and first-generation cephalosporins because of intrinsic AmpC resistance; **third-generation cephalosporins or TMP-SMX are reasonable initial choices** based on local susceptibility data [^2768bcef] [^f970fe5c]. Definitive therapy should be narrowed to susceptibilities, with 7–14 days total treatment for febrile UTIs and close follow-up for clinical response and complications [^aa79cd55] [^ce643685]. Recurrent or complicated cases warrant evaluation for underlying anomalies and resistance risk, and **fluoroquinolones are reserved for severe or resistant infections** given safety concerns in pediatrics [^f970fe5c] [^78d0ec5c].

---

## Epidemiology and risk factors

M. morganii is a **rare uropathogen in children**, accounting for a small proportion of pediatric UTIs [^notfound]. Risk factors include:

- **Underlying urinary tract abnormalities**: Vesicoureteral reflux, obstructive uropathy, or neurogenic bladder increase susceptibility [^75ae50f2].

- **Hospitalization or healthcare exposure**: Indwelling catheters or recent antibiotics elevate risk [^9f7deb4f].

- **Immunocompromised states**: Higher risk of opportunistic infections, including M. morganii [^2ee308e5].

---

## Clinical presentation

M. morganii UTIs present similarly to other Gram-negative UTIs, with symptoms varying by age:

| **Age group** | **Common symptoms** |
|-|-|
| Infants | - Fever <br/> - Irritability <br/> - Poor feeding <br/> - Vomiting <br/> - Lethargy [^notfound] |
| Older children | - Fever <br/> - Dysuria <br/> - Frequency <br/> - Urgency <br/> - Abdominal pain <br/> - Flank pain [^notfound] |

---

Complications can include **pyelonephritis, renal abscess, and bacteremia**, particularly in children with underlying urinary tract abnormalities or immunocompromise [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Accurate diagnosis requires:

- **Urine collection**: Catheterization or suprapubic aspiration is preferred to avoid contamination; bagged specimens are unreliable [^27a3e613].

- **Urinalysis**: Pyuria and/or bacteriuria support the diagnosis [^42244369].

- **Urine culture**: ≥ 50,000 CFU/mL of a single organism confirms UTI [^9270b858].

- **Imaging**: Renal ultrasound is recommended for first febrile UTI or recurrent infections to detect anomalies [^notfound].

---

## Antibiotic resistance patterns

M. morganii exhibits **intrinsic resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin, and first-generation cephalosporins** due to inducible AmpC β-lactamase [^2768bcef]. Resistance to third-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and carbapenems has been reported, particularly in healthcare-associated or recurrent infections [^70801b9b] [^beb5af6b].

---

## Treatment guidelines

### Empiric therapy

Empiric therapy should be guided by **local resistance patterns** and patient-specific factors:

- **First-line agents**: Third-generation cephalosporins (e.g. ceftriaxone, cefotaxime) or TMP-SMX are reasonable initial choices [^f970fe5c].

- **Agents to avoid**: Ampicillin, amoxicillin, and first-generation cephalosporins due to intrinsic resistance [^2768bcef].

- **Severe infections**: Parenteral therapy (e.g. ceftriaxone) is indicated for hospitalized or severely ill children [^723dca33].

---

### Definitive therapy

Definitive therapy should be **narrowed to culture and susceptibility results**:

- **Susceptible organisms**: TMP-SMX, nitrofurantoin, or oral cephalosporins are appropriate [^723dca33].

- **Resistant organisms**: Fluoroquinolones (e.g. ciprofloxacin) or carbapenems may be required for severe or multidrug-resistant infections, with careful consideration of pediatric safety [^868445cc] [^78d0ec5c].

---

### Duration of therapy

Standard duration is **7–14 days** for febrile UTIs, with adjustments based on clinical response and severity [^aa79cd55]. Shorter courses (6–9 days) may be effective in select cases, but evidence is limited [^6031a15d].

---

## Clinical outcomes and complications

With appropriate therapy, **most children recover without sequelae** [^723dca33]. Complications are more likely in children with underlying urinary tract abnormalities, delayed treatment, or resistant organisms, and may include renal scarring, hypertension, or chronic kidney disease [^fe5223d0].

---

## Prevention strategies

Prevention focuses on:

- **Prompt diagnosis and treatment**: Reduces risk of renal damage [^914260d2].

- **Evaluation of underlying anomalies**: Identifies and addresses predisposing factors [^fe5223d0].

- **Antibiotic stewardship**: Prevents emergence of resistance [^3e5275a9].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Follow-up should include **clinical reassessment within 48–72 hours** to ensure response, with repeat urinalysis and culture if symptoms persist [^d49b6f40]. Imaging (renal ultrasound) is recommended for recurrent UTIs or suspected anomalies [^d0327889].

---

Morganella morganii UTIs in children are uncommon but require **careful attention** due to resistance and potential complications. Accurate diagnosis, appropriate empiric therapy, and targeted definitive treatment are essential for optimal outcomes.

### Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim ds [^f1f63104]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain
the effectiveness of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets and other
antibacterial drugs, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets should be used
only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be
caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are
available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial
therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility
patterns may contribute to empiric selection of therapy.

Urinary Tract Infections

For the treatment of urinary tract infections due to susceptible strains of
the following organisms: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Enterobacter species, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus
vulgaris. It is recommended that initial episodes of uncomplicated
urinary tract infections be treated with a single effective antibacterial agent
rather than the combination.

Acute Otitis Media

For the treatment of acute otitis media in pediatric patients due to
susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae when
in the judgment of the physician sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim offers some
advantage over the use of other antimicrobial agents. To date, there are limited
data on the safety of repeated use of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in
pediatric patients under two years of age. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is
not indicated for prophylactic or prolonged administration in otitis media at
any age.

Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Bronchitis in Adults

For the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis due to
susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae when in the judgment of the
physician sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim offers some advantage over the use
of a single antimicrobial agent.

Shigellosis

For the treatment of enteritis caused by susceptible strains of Shigella flexneri and Shigella
sonnei when antibacterial therapy is indicated.

Pneumocystis Carinii Pneumonia

For the treatment of documented Pneumocystis
carinii pneumonia and for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in individuals who are
immunosuppressed and considered to be at an increased risk of developing Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.

Travelers' Diarrhea In Adults

For the treatment of traveler's diarrhea due to susceptible strains of
enterotoxigenic E. coli.

AmpC β-lactamase — organism risk stratification and AST-guided treatment decisions: For E. cloacae, K. aerogenes, or C. freundii recovered in clinical cultures (other than urine cultures in uncomplicated cystitis), the panel suggests generally avoiding ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or ceftazidime even if initially susceptible; basal AmpC β-lactamase production renders these organisms intrinsically resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and first- and second-generation cephalosporins. In contrast, for S. marcescens, M. morganii, or Providencia spp., available data suggest clinically significant AmpC production occurs in less than 5% of these organisms, and when these are recovered from clinical cultures, the panel suggests selecting antibiotic treatment according to AST results. For less common pathogens with inducible chromosomal ampC (eg, Hafnia alvei, Citrobacter youngae, Yersinia enterocolitica), it is reasonable to use AST to guide treatment (eg, ceftriaxone if susceptible), but when treating infections with a high bacterial burden and limited source control (eg, endocarditis, central nervous system infections), it is alternatively reasonable to consider cefepime instead of ceftriaxone even if ceftriaxone-susceptible; if an adequate clinical response is not observed after appropriate therapy and source control, clinicians should consider possible emergence of resistance.

American Academy of Pediatrics urinary tract infection guideline — antimicrobial prophylaxis considerations state that although effectiveness for prevention of UTI has not been demonstrated, the concept has biological plausibility. Antimicrobials reach high urinary concentrations, yet barriers include adherence to a daily regimen, adverse effects, and emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Evidence of effectiveness with a well-tolerated, safe product and parent education are needed; a urinary antiseptic that could be taken indefinitely without resistance is particularly desirable, and probiotics are another possible strategy.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^ce643685]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Conclusions — In infants and young children 2 to 24 months of age with UTI and unexplained fever, diagnosis is based on the presence of pyuria and at least 50 000 CFUs per mL of a single uropathogen in an appropriately collected specimen of urine; urinalysis alone does not provide a definitive diagnosis. Strategies for diagnosis and treatment depend on whether the clinician determines that antimicrobial therapy is warranted immediately or can be delayed safely until urine culture and urinalysis results are available. After 7 to 14 days of antimicrobial treatment, close clinical follow-up monitoring should be maintained with evaluation of the urine during subsequent febrile episodes to permit prompt diagnosis and treatment of recurrent infections.

### Urinary tract infections in children [^4f15c1f3]. Pediatrics in Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for the evaluation, treatment, and management of urinary tract infections (UTIs), UTI diagnosis and management remains challenging for clinicians. Challenges with acute UTI management stem from vague presenting signs and symptoms, diagnostic uncertainty, limitations in laboratory testing, and selecting appropriate antibiotic therapy in an era with increasing rates of antibiotic-resistant uropathogens. Recurrent UTI management remains difficult due to an incomplete understanding of the factors contributing to UTI, when to assess a child with repeated infections for kidney and urinary tract anomalies, and limited prevention strategies. To help reduce these uncertainties, this review provides a comprehensive overview of UTI epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention strategies that may help pediatricians overcome the challenges associated with acute and recurrent UTI management.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^03e88d61]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) present a challenge to the clinician because of the variety of clinical syndromes included and consequent difficulties in synthesizing evidence for practical guidance. The cumulative incidence of all childhood UTI by the age of 7 years is 1%–2% in boys and 7% in girls. Of those presenting to emergency, 5%–24% are deemed cUTI, so it is a common childhood infection. However, defining what makes a UTI complicated is difficult because it has been characterized by a variety of UTI syndromes, which include hosts with abnormal urology or other underlying conditions, severe clinical presentations with or without extensive tissue involvement, and unusual pathogens. For this review and guideline, cUTIs are those that require other management considerations than straightforward lower or upper tract UTIs for which evidence and guidelines exist. Accurate diagnosis and management of cUTI limit morbidity and mortality from sepsis and long-term renal damage. However, most trials of UTI in children have excluded those with cUTI, and consequently, many guidelines also exclude them. The absence of a standardized definition for cUTI has resulted in inconsistencies in treatment approaches, which may lead to increased morbidity among affected children. Existing major UTI guidelines for children either do not address complicated UTIs at all or are limited to only some complications or some age groups. –

This review aims to address the four most important controversies when managing children with cUTI and provide recommendations for definition, investigations, treatment and follow-up. The resulting guidelines offer evidence-graded recommendations specifically for the management of pediatric cUTI, addressing gaps that exist in current guidelines.

Pediatric urinary tract infection (UTI) algorithm — initial evaluation in febrile infants 2–24 months begins with "Infant 2–24 mo with fever ≥ 38°C" and asks whether the patient requires immediate antimicrobial therapy; if immediate therapy is needed, the algorithm directs to "Obtain urine by catheterization or SPA," "Perform urinalysis," and "Culture urine obtained by catheterization or SPA," and the notes state that "A urine sample suitable for culture should be obtained before initiating antimicrobials." Initial management is to "Treat with antimicrobials effective against common uropathogens according to local sensitivity patterns; oral or parenteral," and if "Urinalysis and culture positive?" is not satisfied, "Discontinue antimicrobials."

Microbiology and antibiotic resistance

54% of infections identified in our cohort were due to E. coli, 12% to Enterococcus sp. 9% to Klebsiella pneumoniae and 6% to both Enterobacter cloacae complex and P. aeruginosa (Table 3). At least 50% of UTIs were caused by E. coli for all medical conditions, except for UPJO (38%), which presented more infection caused by P. mirabilis than in the other conditions (p < 0.01). The distribution and frequency of bacterial isolates for each medical condition can be found in the supplementary appendix (Figure S1).

Table 3
Antibiotics resistance by bacteria species and medical condition

This table includes only positive cultures with complete information on antibiotic susceptibility

DCS Double collecting system, SB/NB Spina bifida/neurogenic bladder, UPJO Ureteropelvic junction obstruction, VUR Vesicourethral reflux

* Average number of antimicrobial classes to which resistance was present

On average, bacterial isolates were resistant to 2.3 antibiotic classes, with 70% of bacteria displaying resistance to at least one class and 41% showing resistance to three classes or more (Table 3). Additionally, more than 20% of E. coli, Klebsiella sp. M. morganii and Acinetobacter sp. and 11% of Enterobacter complex were resistant to at least five classes of antibiotics (Table 3).

When stratified by medical condition, we noted that UTIs in patients with UPJO were significantly more resistant to at least one class of antibiotics (p = 0.02) while Sb/Nb had more resistance to at least three classes of antibiotics (p = 0.01).

Several studies support home IV treatment through well-resourced hospital-in-the-home programs if children are stable,– including neonates. In deciding between initial IV or oral antibiotics, the concept of complicated UTI being on a spectrum may be useful. Apart from children with sepsis, the majority with a single complicating feature are initially managed orally. Increasing the number of complicating features increases IV use, so they could be combined into a clinical score with a threshold for using IV. Outside of severe presentation, severe uropathy and neonates, clinically stable children with isolated complicating features can initially be treated with oral antibiotics.

Empiric Antibiotic Choice

Regarding empiric antibiotic choice (1) different cUTI subgroups have different uropathogen prevalence and (2) an individualized risk assessment for resistance is needed based on the child's underlying condition, prior antibiotic use and hospitalization. Based on these, an empiric regimen can be chosen that covers likely pathogens and incorporates the likelihood of resistance (GRADES C and D).
Patients with recurrent infections may initially be treated based on previous cultures (GRADE D).
For children on antibiotic prophylaxis, a different antibiotic choice is needed (GRADE C).
Targeted de-escalated monotherapy is recommended according to susceptibilities once available (GRADE D).

Each cUTI subgroup is vulnerable to different pathogens, and assessment for unusual and multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria is crucial. Risk factors for ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) include recurrent UTI, VUR, recent antibiotic exposure, young age and Klebsiella spp. – Risk factors for more resistant carbapenemase-producing uropathogens are prolonged hospitalization, invasive devices and recent travel to endemic areas. – Empiric antibiotic choice needs to balance the risk of resistance with the need for antimicrobial stewardship for this common infection, potentially accepting a short delay in definitive treatment for children who are hemodynamically stable.

### Tibial osteomyelitis caused by Morganella morganii after external fixation for limb length discrepancy in a pediatric patient: a case report and literature review [^fabb8177]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Morganella morganii is a rare opportunistic pathogen, typically causing urinary tract and postoperative wound infections. This case presents a highly unusual etiology for osteomyelitis. There have only been a handful of cases reported on M. morganii and even fewer causing osteomyelitis (Table 2). The literature review showed that most cases of Morganella osteomyelitis occurred in the distal lower extremities near a past surgical or traumatic site. Our case was unique because symptomatic evidence of infection was not evident until 1 year after surgery. M. morganii is widespread throughout the environment and naturally inhabits our intestinal tract. Due to the time gap from operation to symptomatic presentation, community acquisition with hematogenous inoculation is a plausible theory for etiology.

Table 2
Literature on Morganella morganii Osteomyelitis

A article by De et al.showed that strains of M. morganii have the propensity for biofilm production and removal of biofilm is essential for adequate treatment. In the absence of biofilm and with proper antibiotic penetrance, most cases showed complete resolution of infection without the need for amputation. The antibiotic regimen varied across cases, most treated with broad spectrums, covering gram positives, negatives, and anaerobes. In this case, once Morganella was isolated, antibiotic treatment was transitioned from clindamycin to a third-generation cephalosporin (cefdinir). The literature review showed one other case choosing to make the same transition in the setting of a foot abscess colonized by Morganella; in this case, the patient had complete resolution within 1 year of management. Interestingly, in our case, there was a lack of radiological evidence for osteomyelitis and the decision for treatment was based on symptomatology and microbiological evidence. One other case report documented the lack of initial plan radiograph evidence; however, follow-up MRI showed radiological features of osteomyelitis. Plain radiographs are the best screening measure for chronic osteomyelitis; however, up to 50% to 75% of the bone matrix must be destroyed for the radiograph to show lytic lesions.MRI should be considered if radiological evidence is wanted because the pathogenesis of osteomyelitis caused by atypical pathogens may not mirror common etiologies. In addition, external fixation has a known high risk of pin tract infection, though superficial. It is important to be wary when using intramedullary nailing in a limb lengthening capacity due to risk of spread to the whole bone.

### Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of urinary tract infections in pediatrics and adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^283966fa]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Traditional approaches to practice guidelines frequently result in dissociation between strength of recommendation and quality of evidence.

Objective

To create a clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections that addresses the gap between the evidence and recommendation strength.

Evidence Review

This consensus statement and systematic review applied an approach previously established by the WikiGuidelines Group to construct collaborative clinical guidelines. In May 2023, new and existing members were solicited for questions on urinary tract infection prevention, diagnosis, and management. For each topic, literature searches were conducted up until early 2024 in any language. Evidence was reported according to the WikiGuidelines charter: clear recommendations were established only when reproducible, prospective, controlled studies provided hypothesis-confirming evidence. In the absence of such data, clinical reviews were developed discussing the available literature and associated risks and benefits of various approaches.

Findings

A total of 54 members representing 12 countries reviewed 914 articles and submitted information relevant to 5 sections: prophylaxis and prevention (7 questions), diagnosis and diagnostic stewardship (7 questions), empirical treatment (3 questions), definitive treatment and antimicrobial stewardship (10 questions), and special populations and genitourinary syndromes (10 questions). Of 37 unique questions, a clear recommendation could be provided for 6 questions. In 3 of the remaining questions, a clear recommendation could only be provided for certain aspects of the question. Clinical reviews were generated for the remaining questions and aspects of questions not meeting criteria for a clear recommendation.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this consensus statement that applied the WikiGuidelines method for clinical guideline development, the majority of topics relating to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of urinary tract infections lack high-quality prospective data and clear recommendations could not be made. Randomized clinical trials are underway to address some of these gaps; however further research is of utmost importance to inform true evidence-based, rather than eminence-based practice.

### The use of systemic and topical fluoroquinolones [^f970fe5c]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) in children — empiric therapy and limited fluoroquinolone role — emphasizes cephalosporins for uncomplicated cases and restricts fluoroquinolones to severe presentations. Standard empiric therapy for uncomplicated UTI in the pediatric population continues to be a cephalosporin antibiotic agent, because TMP-SMX– and amoxicillin-resistant E coli are increasingly common. The fluoroquinolones remain potential first-line agents only in the setting of pyelonephritis or complicated UTI.

### Urinary tract infection in children [^b04c4cae]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Up to 7 percent of girls and 2 percent of boys will have a symptomatic, culture-confirmed urinary tract infection by six years of age. Urinary tract infection may be suspected because of urinary symptoms in older children or because of fever, nonspecific symptoms, or failure to thrive in infants. Urine dipstick analysis is useful for ruling out urinary tract infections in cases with low clinical suspicion. However, urine culture is necessary for diagnosis of urinary tract infections in children if there is high clinical suspicion, cloudy urine, or if urine dipstick testing shows positive leukocyte esterase or nitrite activity. Despite current recommendations, routine imaging studies (e.g., renal ultrasonography, voiding cystourethrography, renal scans) do not appear to improve clinical outcomes in uncomplicated urinary tract infections. Oral antibiotics are as effective as parenteral therapy in randomized trials. The optimal duration of antibiotic therapy has not been established, but one-day therapies have been shown to be inferior to longer treatment courses.

### Comparative effectiveness of antibiotic treatment duration in children with pyelonephritis [^6031a15d]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

National guidelines recommend treating children with pyelonephritis for 7 to 14 days of antibiotic therapy, yet data are lacking to suggest a more precise treatment duration.

Objective

To compare the clinical outcomes of children receiving a short-course vs a prolonged-course of antibiotic treatment for pyelonephritis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective observational study using inverse probability of treatment weighted propensity score analysis of data from 5 hospitals in Maryland between July 1, 2016, and October 1, 2018. Participants were children aged 6 months to 18 years with a urine culture growing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, or Proteus mirabilis with laboratory and clinical criteria for pyelonephritis.

Exposures

Treatment of pyelonephritis with a short-course (6 to 9 days) vs a prolonged-course (10 or more days) of antibiotics.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Composite outcome of treatment failure within 30 days of completing antibiotic therapy: (a) unanticipated emergency department or outpatient visits related to urinary tract infection symptoms, (b) hospital readmission related to UTI symptoms, (c) prolongation of the planned, initial antibiotic treatment course, or (d) death. A subsequent urinary tract infection caused by a drug-resistant bacteria within 30 days was a secondary outcome.

Results

Of 791 children who met study eligibility criteria (mean [SD] age 9.2 [6.3] years; 672 [85.0%]) were girls, 297 patients (37.5%) were prescribed a short-course and 494 patients (62.5%) were prescribed a prolonged-course of antibiotics. The median duration of short-course therapy was 8 days (interquartile range, 7–8 days), and the median duration of prolonged-course therapy was 11 days (interquartile range, 11–12 days). Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups in the inverse probability of treatment weighted cohort. There were 79 children (10.1%) who experienced treatment failure. The odds of treatment failure were similar for patients prescribed a short-course vs a prolonged-course of antibiotics (11.2% vs 9.4%; odds ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.75–1.98). There was no significant difference in the odds of a drug-resistant uropathogen for patients with a subsequent urinary tract infection within 30 days when prescribed a short-courses vs prolonged-course of antibiotics (40% vs 64%; odds ratio, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.09–1.43).

Conclusions and Relevance

The study findings suggest that short-course antibiotic therapy may be as effective as prolonged-courses for children with pyelonephritis, and may mitigate the risk of future drug-resistant urinary tract infections. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Enterobacterales at moderate risk for clinically significant AmpC production — third-generation cephalosporins and ceftriaxone use: Available data suggest that the emergence of resistance after ceftriaxone exposure occurs in approximately 20% of infections caused by E. cloacae, K. aerogenes, or C. freundii, and the panel suggests generally avoiding third-generation cephalosporins when treating infections caused by these organisms. Based on the mild nature of uncomplicated cystitis and the sufficient urinary excretion of ceftriaxone, ceftriaxone may be adequate therapy for the management of AmpC-E uncomplicated cystitis, and for other relatively uncomplicated infections it may be reasonable to transition to ceftriaxone after clinical improvement has been achieved and if there are no concerns for ongoing sources of infection, weighing the convenience of once-daily ceftriaxone dosing with the potentially increased risk of emergence of resistance.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^e8c912dd]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Over the last 5 years, new and updated pediatric UTI guidelines from around the world have become increasingly consistent for uncomplicated UTI, but either do not address or differ in definition and recommendations for complicated UTI. This is the first comprehensive guideline focused exclusively on cUTI in children that addresses its diagnosis and management according to the features making it complicated: young age, disease severity/extent and comorbidities. This guideline is comprehensive in addressing gaps in existing guidelines by first highlighting that cUTI is not a uniform entity but rather constitutes a wide range of disease processes. The guideline presents the evidence for diagnosing and managing the subgroups presenting with each of these processes to ensure more individualized patient management. It also reviews emerging evidence for conceptualizing cUTI as an amalgamation of patients' individual features and attainment of a threshold for more intense management. Regardless of the subgroup, accurate diagnosis is the critical first step in managing children with cUTI for which additional investigations, such as blood culture, serum biochemistry and USS, might be required. While several subgroups benefit from initial IV (sepsis, VUR 3–5, neonates) and broad-spectrum antibiotics (sepsis, high risk of resistance from recurrent UTI and immunocompromise), oral narrow-spectrum antibiotics are recommended for most children with cUTI who are not severely unwell. Prophylaxis is not needed universally in cUTI, and its relatively small benefits in specific subgroups need to be weighed against the risk of resistance, with at least 6-monthly reevaluation for its requirement. Longer-term follow-up should aim to assess the need for surgical intervention to reduce the risk of renal damage.

Despite cUTI being common in children, differences in definition and focus on uncomplicated infection have led to scarce high-grade evidence for management, that is also difficult to synthesize. Apart from RCT-based recommendations for CAP in children with urological abnormality, these guidelines are largely based on retrospective studies and expert consensus in areas where high-quality evidence is currently lacking. In addition, available evidence mostly comes from resource-rich settings, and in resource-limited settings there may be some barriers to accessing some investigations and treatments, for example, nuclear medicine imaging and broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, most first-line investigations in the guideline are broadly available and most antibiotic recommendations are from the World Health Organization Access list which should be available in most countries. Therefore, these guidelines can be effectively implemented in most healthcare settings, even in resource-limited environments.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^6367ad96]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

The European Society of Pediatric Infectious Diseases Guidelines Committee convened a working group of experts from microbiology, pediatric nephrology and infectious diseases. The working group conducted a comprehensive literature review using PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane library of studies published until December 2024. Search terms included: urinary tract infection/UTI, complicated, complex, atypical, urinary tract abnormality/anomaly, recurrent/recurrence, chronic renal/kidney disease/failure, immunosuppression, adolescent, child, pediatric, infant, neonate/neonatal, definition, investigations, diagnosis, treatment, management, antibiotics, prophylaxis and imaging. Studies were included for review if they involved children under 18 years with any definition of cUTI and excluded if they focused solely on uncomplicated UTI (uUTI) or adults. Types of included studies were reviews, trials, comparative and cohort studies and existing guidelines were also reviewed for references. Four key controversies were identified from experience and available literature: definition of cUTI, investigations, treatment and follow-up. Evaluation of evidence quality and formulation of recommendations used GRADE methodology. After assessment of the literature on definition, cUTIs were categorized into 5 main subgroups, and respective management guidelines were formulated from the graded evidence by working group consensus.

### A rare opportunist, decreases severity of polymicrobial catheter-associated urinary tract infection [^9cc5eb7a]. Infection and Immunity (2019). Medium credibility.

Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are common hospital-acquired infections and frequently polymicrobial, which complicates effective treatment. However, few studies experimentally address the consequences of polymicrobial interactions within the urinary tract, and the clinical significance of polymicrobial bacteriuria is not fully understood. Proteus mirabilis is one of the most common causes of monomicrobial and polymicrobial CAUTI and frequently cocolonizes with Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Providencia stuartii, and Morganella morganii P. mirabilis infections are particularly challenging due to its potent urease enzyme, which facilitates formation of struvite crystals, catheter encrustation, blockage, and formation of urinary stones. We previously determined that interactions between P. mirabilis and other uropathogens can enhance P. mirabilis urease activity, resulting in greater disease severity during experimental polymicrobial infection. Our present work reveals that M. morganii acts on P. mirabilis in a contact-independent manner to decrease urease activity. Furthermore, M. morganii actively prevents urease enhancement by E. faecalis, P. stuartii, and E. coli Importantly, these interactions translate to modulation of disease severity during experimental CAUTI, predominantly through a urease-dependent mechanism. Thus, products secreted by multiple bacterial species in the milieu of the catheterized urinary tract can directly impact prognosis.

Nevertheless, clinical and microbiologic outcomes as well as formation of renal scars did not differ between the 2 groups.

Initial management

General

Children with UTI require targeted antibiotics and supportive care. Most children with UTI can be managed at home with oral fluids and antibiotics. A small percentage will require admission for intravenous therapy, including very young and very unwell children, children with significant renal tract anomalies and children not responding to oral therapy.

Antibiotic therapy

Choice of empiric antibiotics must be guided by local guidelines, as local antimicrobial sensitivities vary significantly (table 2). The suitability of the initial agent should be reviewed once culture results are available.

Table 2
Recent evidence, controversies and emerging evidence

Oral antibiotics are effective for the overwhelming majority of paediatric UTI. Previous Cochrane reviews suggest that short 2–4 days courses are as effective as longer 7–14 days for uncomplicated cystitis, while single dose therapy is less effective. American guidelines recommend treatment durations of 7–14 days for both cystitis and pyelonephritis, Canadian guidelines recommend 7–10 days, while National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines suggests 7–10 days for pyelonephritis and a shorter 3 day course for children > 3 months with cystitis. Spanish guidelines mirror NICE recommendations though single-dose therapy is recommended for children aged > 6 years with uncomplicated cystitis.

Younger and sicker children may require initial intravenous therapy. Many guidelines and centres recommend admission, intravenous antibiotics and consideration of septic work-up for infants < 3 months. Aim to switch to oral therapy after 48 hours if there is clinical improvement.

Antibiotic resistance

Antibiotic resistant UTI is becoming more common globally, increases morbidity and doubles healthcare costs. The usual mechanism is through acquisition of enhanced beta-lactamase enzyme properties. Some Gram negative uropathogens can inactivate beta-lactam ring antibiotics such as penicillin and early generation cephalosporins with inherent beta-lactamase enzymes. However, some have acquired further multidrug-resistant properties through evolution of these enzymes, including the ability to hydrolyse and inactivate extended spectrum cephalosporins and carbapenem antibiotics. Such organisms are known as extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) organisms. Prior antibiotic therapy and hospitalisation are risk factors for ESBL carriage, which then contributes to community carriage and transmission of resistance. Rates of resistant UTIs are particularly high in resource-limited settings, where resistance to common oral antibiotics such as ampicillin and cotrimoxazole can be as high as 97%–100%.

### Empiric use of cefepime in the treatment of serious urinary tract infections in children [^1fb80c4b]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in childhood. They represent a significant proportion (10%) of hospital-acquired infections in children. Bacteria causing UTIs in children vary, depending on the setting (community-acquired vs. nosocomial), underlying anatomic anomalies and concurrent medical conditions.

Objective

To review published and unpublished clinical studies that have used cefepime for the treatment of UTIs in children.

Methods and Results

In two recent multicenter, randomized trials, cefepime (50 mg/kg/dose every 8 h and every 12 h) was compared with ceftazidime (50 mg/kg/dose every 8 h) for the treatment of serious urinary tract infections including pyelonephritis in children less than 12 years of age. In these studies a favorable clinical and microbiologic response was observed in > 95% of cefepime-treated and ceftazidime-treated children assessed at the end of treatment.

Conclusions

These results indicate that cefepime represents an important therapeutic option for the treatment of serious UTIs in children.

### Pediatric urinary tract infection: does the evidence support aggressively pursuing the diagnosis? [^361bf94e]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The epidemiology of pediatric fever has changed considerably during the past 2 decades with the development of vaccines against the most common bacterial pathogens causing bacteremia and meningitis. The decreasing incidence of these 2 conditions among vaccinated children has led to an emphasis on urinary tract infection as a remaining source of potentially hidden infections in febrile children. Emerging literature, however, has led to questions about both the degree and nature of the danger posed by urinary tract infection in nonverbal children, whereas the aggressive pursuit of the diagnosis consumes resources and leads to patient discomfort, medical risks, and potential overdiagnosis. We review both early and emerging literature to examine the utility and efficacy of early identification and treatment of urinary tract infection in children younger than 24 months. We conclude that in well children of this age, it may be reasonable to withhold or delay testing for urinary tract infection if signs of other sources are apparent or if the fever has been present for fewer than 4 to 5 days.

Regarding medical management for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, more specifically with respect to management of Enterobacterales infections (AmpC beta-lactamase-producing), IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend to consider deciding on the choice of antibiotic treatment for S. marcescens, M. morganii, and Providencia species infections based on antimicrobial sensitivity testing results, recognizing that basal production of AmpC β-lactamase renders these organisms intrinsically resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and first- and second-generation cephalosporins.

Additional blood tests, and imaging can be useful depending on the subgroup of cUTI, both for initial diagnosis and subsequently (Table 2), with the rationale for their use often different at different stages in the infection. For example, USS of the kidneys and urinary tract during the acute phase can neither rule in nor rule out an upper UTI (pyelonephritis) or vesicoureteric reflux (VUR). Therefore, the role of acute USS in children with urosepsis, septic shock, poor urine flow, abdominal or bladder mass and increased creatinine is to determine whether there is acute obstruction that needs urgent surgical intervention.USS may be performed for different reasons, including failure to respond with suitable antibiotics within 48 hours to investigate for renal abscess, or for recurrent UTI to assess for other urological abnormalities needing intervention.

All children should be reassessed 48 hours after diagnosis for (1) clinical response to treatment, (2) confirmation of the diagnosis and (3) potential targeting of antibiotics according to susceptibility (aim to the narrow antimicrobial spectrum).

Treatment should be stopped if the UTI diagnosis is not confirmed, that is, most cases with a negative urine culture with no prior antibiotics to explain this. If the response to treatment is atypical and does not follow the expected trajectory after 48 hours, reassessment for the cause is imperative, rather than simply switching to IV or broader-spectrum antibiotics (although either of these could be needed). Depending on the clinical situation, repeat urine culture, inflammatory markers, serum creatinine and renal USS may be needed to confirm the UTI diagnosis and assess for complications. Other investigations may be needed to seek an alternate/additional diagnosis.

How Should Children With cUTI be Treated?

Treatment of cUTI involves consideration of antibiotic route, choice and duration and supportive management. The majority of RCTs and meta-analyses of childhood UTIs exclude those with cUTIs, so recommendations largely rely on a synthesis of retrospective studies (see Table, Supplemental Digital Content 2,) and expert opinion to provide a practical empirical guideline to initiate treatment (Table 3). Due to the variability of complicating features even within subgroups, a further individualized approach is often needed, considering local antibiograms, past urine cultures, antibiotic exposure, hospital admissions, urine catheterization and other host factors, including allergies.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria in infancy — An important cause of bacteriuria without pyuria is asymptomatic bacteriuria, which can occur in infants. In a study of infants 2 to 24 months of age, 0.7% of afebrile girls had 3 successive urine cultures with 105 CFUs per mL of a single uropathogen; this condition can be confused with true UTI but should be distinguished because studies suggest antimicrobial treatment may do more harm than good, and the key discriminator is the presence of pyuria.

ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) — cefepime: The panel suggests avoiding cefepime for the treatment of pyelonephritis or cUTI and for infections outside of the urinary tract caused by ESBL-E, even if cefepime tests susceptible; however, if cefepime was started empirically for uncomplicated cystitis due to an organism later identified as ESBL-E and the patient improves, no change or extension of therapy is necessary. Rationale includes that ESBLs commonly hydrolyze cefepime, cefepime MIC testing may be inaccurate and/or poorly reproducible with commercial AST methods, clinical trials comparing cefepime with a carbapenem for ESBL-E bloodstream infections have not been conducted, and for these reasons the panel suggests avoiding cefepime for invasive ESBL-E infections.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^fce7a0e7]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background:

Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) present a challenge to the clinician because of the variety in clinical syndromes included and consequent difficulties in synthesizing evidence. A harmonized definition of cUTI does not exist. In national guidelines, management recommendations for cUTI are often neglected. We aimed to define the four most important controversies and formulate management recommendations for cUTI in children and adolescents.

Methods:

The European Society of Pediatric Infectious Diseases Guideline Committee convened a working group of experts from microbiology, pediatric nephrology and infectious diseases with expertise in managing children with UTI. A comprehensive literature review was done using PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane library to find studies in children under 18 years published until December 2024. Four controversies were defined from experience and available evidence. Children with cUTI were categorized into 5 subgroups: anatomical/functional urological abnormalities, multiple UTI recurrences, severe clinical presentation, nonurological underlying conditions and neonates. Respective management guidelines were formulated through the evidence and by consensus of working group members. Recommendations were made using GRADE criteria.

Results:

The term cUTI is generally used to define children with UTI with an increased likelihood of failing conventional management. The included 5 subgroups are the most likely to need additional investigations at diagnosis and during the course of infection, initial intravenous antibiotics, longer treatment duration, antibiotic prophylaxis, follow-up imaging and surgical referral. These are detailed for each subgroup.

Conclusions:

These comprehensive guidelines offer evidence-graded recommendations specifically for pediatric cUTI, addressing gaps that exist in current guidelines.

Indications and Usage

Cefizox (ceftizoxime for injection, USP) is indicated in the treatment of infections due to susceptible strains of the microorganisms listed below.

Lower Respiratory Tract Infections caused by Klebsiella spp.; Proteus mirabilis; Escherichia coli; Haemophilus influenzae including ampicillin­resistant strains; Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase­ and nonpenicillinase­producing); Serratia spp.; Enterobacter spp.; Bacteroides spp.; and Streptococcus spp. including S. pneumoniae, but excluding enterococci.

Urinary Tract Infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase­ and nonpenicillinase­producing); Escherichia coli; Pseudomonas spp. including P. aeruginosa; Proteus mirabilis; P. vulgaris; Providencia rettgeri (formerly Proteus rettgeri) and Morganella morganii (formerly Proteus morganii); Klebsiella spp.; Serratia spp. including S. marcescens; and Enterobacter spp.

Gonorrhea including uncomplicated cervical and urethral gonorrhea caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

Pelvic Inflammatory Disease caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli or Streptococcus agalactiae. NOTE: Ceftizoxime, like other cephalosporins, has no activity against Chlamydia trachomatis. Therefore, when cephalosporins are used in the treatment of patients with pelvic inflammatory disease and C. trachomatis is one of the suspected pathogens, appropriate anti­chlamydial coverage should be added.

Uncomplicated cystitis caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) — agents with expected activity and alternatives — includes nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin, which all achieve high concentrations in urine and are expected to be effective for uncomplicated CRE cystitis if the isolate is susceptible. A single dose of an aminoglycoside is an alternative option; oral fosfomycin is an alternative for uncomplicated cystitis caused by Escherichia coli, including if carbapenem resistant; and colistin is an alternative agent that converts to its active form in the urinary tract. Treatment suggestions for CRE infections listed below assume that in vitro activity of preferred and alternative antibiotics has been demonstrated.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® urinary tract infection-child: 2023 update [^fe5223d0]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a frequent infection in childhood. The diagnosis is usually made by history and physical examination and confirmed by urine analysis. Cystitis is infection or inflammation confined to the bladder, whereas pyelonephritis is infection or inflammation of kidneys. Pyelonephritis can cause renal scarring, which is the most severe long-term sequela of UTI and can lead to accelerated nephrosclerosis, leading to hypertension and chronic renal failure. The role of imaging is to guide treatment by identifying patients who are at high risk to develop recurrent UTIs or renal scarring. This document provides initial imaging guidelines for children presenting with first febrile UTI with appropriate response to medical management, atypical or recurrent febrile UTI, and follow-up imaging for children with established vesicoureteral reflux. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Revised AAP guideline on UTI in febrile infants and young children [^15a8f0c0]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

In 2011, the American Academy of Pediatrics released a revision of its 1999 clinical practice guideline on urinary tract infections in febrile infants and young children two to 24 months of age. The new clinical practice guideline has several important updates based on evidence generated over the past decade. The updated guideline includes clinical criteria for collecting urine specimens. Diagnosis now requires evidence of infection from both abnormal urinalysis results and positive urine culture results (the criterion for a positive culture has been reduced from at least 100,000 colony-forming units per mL to at least 50,000 colony-forming units per mL). Oral treatment now is considered to be as effective as parenteral treatment. Renal and bladder ultrasonography is still recommended, but the biggest change in the current guideline is that routine voiding cystourethrography is no longer recommended after the first urinary tract infection. Follow-up is based on evaluating children for urinary tract infection during subsequent febrile episodes, rather than routinely performing repeat urine cultures.

Common uropathogens in children with significant urologic abnormalities, including postsurgery and instrumentation, are Enterobacterales, P. aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus.– To cover these, if IV antibiotics are needed, an aminoglycoside or broad-spectrum cephalosporin is recommended, with a child's individual history guiding whether to cover rarer S. aureus or more indolent Enterococcus spp. empirically. Where multiple antibiotics have previously been used, assessment of the likelihood of resistance is part of management (see below).

Multiple recurrent UTIs, defined by 2 or more UTIs caused by different organisms, are a risk for resistant and MDR bacteria. Although recurrent UTIs might occur without anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract, other risk factors include VUR, underlying neurological conditions, prolonged hospitalization and UTI prophylaxis, and girls are at higher risk than boys. If on prophylaxis, a different treatment antibiotic is required due to breakthrough. For children at high risk of resistance, including suspected ESBL-E, empiric oral options include nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, quinolones and fosfomycin. Empirical IV options for children at moderate risk of resistance but who have never cultured ESBL-E include gentamicin and quinolones. If there has been previous ESBL-E or clinical risk is higher, IV amikacin retains high susceptibility to uropathogens, concentrates well in urine and can avoid broad-spectrum beta-lactam and carbapenem use. Most gentamicin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae exhibit cross-resistance to tobramycin but remain susceptible to amikacin, due to reduced inactivation by bacterial enzymes. If cultures grow Klebsiella pneumoniae with high bacterial inoculum, empirical B-lactam antibiotics should be switched to a different class. With a high bacterial inoculum, the stationary phase is rapidly reached, so the effect of targeting penicillin-binding proteins is rapidly diminished, and an alternative is better. In the large majority, carbapenems should be spared since their use is the greatest risk for developing carbapenem resistance. Even with a history of recurrent UTI with resistant uropathogens, empirical carbapenems are rarely needed in children with cUTI unless a child presents with sepsis (see below). – If the identified uropathogen is MDR, including carbapenem-resistant, options include a carbapenem plus amikacin combination, colistin and newer B-lactam/B-lactamase antibiotics such as ceftazidime-avibactam. Since methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is an uncommon uropathogen, this rarely needs to be covered empirically. P. aeruginosa (susceptible and resistant) is more common in recurrent UTIs, so it should be empirically treated with oral quinolones or IV aminoglycosides.

Observational and clinical data indicate increased mortality and excess nephrotoxicity with polymyxin-based regimens relative to comparator agents, supporting avoidance except for the noted cystitis exception.

### Diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infections in children [^4e6bb0e5]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Acute urinary tract infections are relatively common in children, with 8 percent of girls and 2 percent of boys having at least one episode by seven years of age. The most common pathogen is Escherichia coli, accounting for approximately 85 percent of urinary tract infections in children. Renal parenchymal defects are present in 3 to 15 percent of children within one to two years of their first diagnosed urinary tract infection. Clinical signs and symptoms of a urinary tract infection depend on the age of the child, but all febrile children two to 24 months of age with no obvious cause of infection should be evaluated for urinary tract infection (with the exception of circumcised boys older than 12 months). Evaluation of older children may depend on the clinical presentation and symptoms that point toward a urinary source (e.g., leukocyte esterase or nitrite present on dipstick testing; pyuria of at least 10 white blood cells per high-power field and bacteriuria on microscopy). Increased rates of E. coli resistance have made amoxicillin a less acceptable choice for treatment, and studies have found higher cure rates with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Other treatment options include amoxicillin/clavulanate and cephalosporins. Prophylactic antibiotics do not reduce the risk of subsequent urinary tract infections, even in children with mild to moderate vesicoureteral reflux. Constipation should be avoided to help prevent urinary tract infections. Ultrasonography, cystography, and a renal cortical scan should be considered in children with urinary tract infections.

### Tibial osteomyelitis caused by Morganella morganii after external fixation for limb length discrepancy in a pediatric patient: a case report and literature review [^70801b9b]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Morganella morganii is a facultative, anaerobic rod Gram-negative enteric bacterium, first isolated in 1906 by Morgan et al. It is a rare opportunistic pathogen most associated with wound, soft tissue, and urinary tract infections, but there have been reports of sepsis, ecthyma, endophthalmitis, chorioamnionitis, and pericarditis. Drug resistance of M. morganii has increased over recent years increasing pathogenicityand clinical treatment failure. Mortality rates are relatively high in some reports.

Osteomyelitis is caused by a wide variety of pathogens, most commonly various strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococci, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomona. As of the time of literature review, there have only been a handful of documented cases of osteomyelitis secondary to M. morganii. We describe the clinical course of an infection in a pediatric patient after external fixation surgery for leg length discrepancy at a tertiary health facility.

### Long-term antibiotics for preventing recurrent urinary tract infection in children [^81acdbfa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in children. Symptoms include fever, lethargy, anorexia, and vomiting. UTI is caused by Escherichia coli in over 80% of cases and treatment is a course of antibiotics. Due to acute illness caused by UTI and the risk of pyelonephritis-induced permanent kidney damage, many children are given long-term (several months to 2 years) antibiotics aimed at preventing recurrence. This is the third update of a review first published in 2001 and updated in 2006, and 2011.

Objectives

To assess whether long-term antibiotic prophylaxis was more effective than placebo/no treatment in preventing recurrence of UTI in children, and if so which antibiotic in clinical use was the most effective. We also assessed the harms of long-term antibiotic treatment.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 30 July 2018 through contact with the Cochrane Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

Randomised comparisons of antibiotics with other antibiotics, placebo or no treatment to prevent recurrent UTI in children.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed and extracted information for the initial and previous updates. A random-effects model was used to estimate risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) for recurrent UTI with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

In this update sixteen studies (2036 children randomised, 1977 analysed) were included. Seven studies (612 children) compared two or more types of antibiotics, six (1088 children) compared antibiotics with placebo or no treatment, one four-armed study compared circumcision with and without antibiotic treatment, one study compared dose of antibiotic, and one three-armed study compared two different antibiotics as well as no treatment. Of the sixteen included studies only one study was judged to be at low risk of bias for all domains, with the majority judged to be at unclear risk of bias due to very poorly reported methodology. The number of studies judged to be a low risk of bias was: selection bias (7); performance bias (4); detection bias (1); attrition bias (6); reporting bias (7); and other bias (2). The number of studies judged to be at high risk of bias was: selection bias (0); performance bias (5); detection bias (1); attrition bias (4); reporting bias (6); and other bias (1). Compared to placebo/no treatment, antibiotics lead to a modest decrease in the number of repeat symptomatic UTI in children; however the estimate from combining all studies was not certain and the confidence interval indicates low precision indicating that antibiotics may make little or no difference to risk of repeat infection (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.98). When we combined only the data from studies with concealed treatment allocation, there was a similar reduction in risk of repeat symptomatic UTI in children taking antibiotics (RR 0.68) and we have greater certainty in this estimate because of the more robust study designs, the confidence interval is smaller and it does not include the point of no effect (95% CI 0.48 to 0.95). The estimated reduction in risk of repeat symptomatic UTI for children taking antibiotics was similar in children with vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.07) compared to those without VUR (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.12) however there was considerable uncertainty due to imprecision from fewer events in the smaller group of children with VUR. There was no consistency in occurrence of adverse events, with one study having more events in the placebo group and a second study having more events in the antibiotics group. Three studies reported data for antibiotic resistance with the analysis estimating the risk of a UTI caused by a bacteria resistant to the prophylactic antibiotic being almost 2.5 times greater in children on antibiotics than for children on placebo or no treatment (RR 2.40, 95% CI 0.62 to 9.26). However the confidence interval is wide, showing imprecision and there may be little or no difference between the two groups. Eight studies involving 659 children compared one antibiotic with another but few studies compared the same combination for the same outcome so little data could be pooled. Two studies reported microbial resistance data and analysis showed that treatment with nitrofurantoin may lead to a lower risk of a UTI caused by a bacteria resistant to the treatment drug compared to children given trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole as their prophylactic treatment (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.92).

Authors' Conclusions

Long-term antibiotics may reduce the risk of repeat symptomatic UTI in children who have had one or more previous UTIs but the benefit may be small and must be considered together with the increased risk of microbial resistance.

Treatment

Cefoxitin for Injection, USP is indicated for the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the diseases listed below.

(1) Lower respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia and lung abscess, caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, other streptococci (excluding enterococci, e.g. Enterococcus faecalis [formerly Streptococcus faecalis]), Staphylococcus aureus (including penicillinase-producing strains), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Haemophilus influenzae, and Bacteroides species.

(2) Urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Proteus vulgaris and Providencia species (including P. rettgeri).

(3) Intra-abdominal infections, including peritonitis and intra-abdominal abscess, caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Bacteroides species including Bacteroides fragilis, and Clostridium species.

(4) Gynecological infections, including endometritis, pelvic cellulitis, and pelvic inflammatory disease caused by Escherichia coli, Neisseria gonorrhoeae (including penicillinase-producing strains), Bacteroides species including B. fragilis, Clostridium species, Peptococcus niger, Peptostreptococcus species and Streptococcus agalactiae. Cefoxitin for Injection, USP, like cephalosporins, has no activity against Chlamydia trachomatis. Therefore, when Cefoxitin for Injection, USP is used in the treatment of patients with pelvic inflammatory disease and C. trachomatis is one of the suspected pathogens, appropriate anti-chlamydial coverage should be added.

Selection of definitive antibiotic therapy for complicated UTI — In patients with confirmed complicated UTI, we suggest selecting a definitive effective antibiotic with a targeted spectrum based on the results of urine culture (identification and susceptibility) as soon as these are available, rather than continuing empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics for the complete duration of treatment (conditional recommendation, low certainty of the evidence). The comment states that this recommendation places a high value on de-escalating antibiotic therapy based on culture results and notes that de-escalation may be less practical in cases of cUTI managed in the outpatient setting.

Question 1.2 — ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) pyelonephritis or complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) treatment: Suggested approach states that TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin are preferred treatment options for pyelonephritis or cUTIs caused by ESBL-E, with ertapenem, meropenem, and imipenem-cilastatin preferred when resistance or toxicities preclude TMP-SMX or fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides as alternative options. The rationale specifies that these agents are preferred assuming in vitro susceptibility; carbapenems are also preferred when resistance or toxicities prevent use or early if the patient is critically ill, and if a carbapenem is initiated and susceptibility to TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin is demonstrated, transitioning to oral formulations is preferred over completing a carbapenem course. Aminoglycosides are considered alternative because of nephrotoxicity risk; in a clinical trial of 609 adults receiving plazomicin once daily compared to meropenem for cUTI and pyelonephritis, an increase in serum creatinine of ≥ 0.5 mg above baseline occurred in 7% vs 4%. Additional considerations include that in 2023 the CLSI revised gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin breakpoints for Enterobacterales; aminoglycosides may be reasonable for completing treatment courses given prolonged renal cortical activity and convenience of once daily dosing, and duration-dependent nephrotoxicity risks should be considered. Fosfomycin is not suggested for pyelonephritis or cUTI given limited renal parenchymal concentrations; more data are needed, and a clinical trial of 97 women with E. coli pyelonephritis reported approximately half with bacteremia, up to 5 days of IV therapy, and participants subsequently transitioned to either once-daily 3 g.

AmpC-producing Enterobacterales (AmpC-E) serious infections — piperacillin-tazobactam use is discouraged except in limited circumstances. The panel suggests against prescribing piperacillin-tazobactam for serious infections caused by AmpC-E, noting at least 4 observational studies identifying poorer clinical outcomes in patients prescribed piperacillin-tazobactam. Piperacillin-tazobactam may be a reasonable treatment option for mild infections such as uncomplicated cystitis, and for other relatively uncomplicated infections it may be reasonable to transition to piperacillin-tazobactam in settings of adverse events to preferred agents or other patient-specific factors. This practice is only advised after clinical improvement has been achieved and if there are no concerns for ongoing sources of infection.

### Global prevalence of antibiotic resistance in paediatric urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli and association with routine use of antibiotics in primary care: systematic review and meta-analysis [^60df4b65]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Policy, clinical, and research implications

Our findings detail global high level resistance to some of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics for children primary care, which could result in several drugs becoming ineffective first line treatments in many countries. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in collaboration with the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID)recommend that an antibiotic should be selected for first line empirical treatment of urinary tract infection only if the local prevalence of resistance is less than 20%. According to these guidelines, our review suggests ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, and trimethoprim are no longer suitable first line treatment options for urinary tract infection in many OECD countries and that as a result many guidelines, such as those published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), might need updating. In non-OECD countries, resistance to all first line antibiotics specified for urinary tract infections was in excess of 20% (appendix 5), suggesting that choices of first line treatment might need to be re-evaluated in less well developed countries. Our results also support the need for prescribing guidelines to reflect patterns of local resistance and that, for many areas, nitrofurantoin might be the most appropriate first line treatment for lower urinary tract infection. That said, care is needed because ruling out the use of some first line antibiotics could lead clinicians to prescribe broad spectrum second line antibiotics, such as co-amoxiclav, cephalosporins, and quinolones, resulting in a vicious cycle of increasing use of broad spectrum antibiotics and bacterial resistance.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^ca0d435c]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

In neonates and infants < 2 months, common pathogens include E. coli, Klebsiella spp. Proteus spp. Enterobacter spp. group B streptococcus and Enterococcus spp. In preterm infants, hematogenous transmission is more prevalent, with CoNS and Candida spp. being causative pathogens. Empirical IV ampicillin and gentamicin are recommended for neonatal UTI by the World Health Organization. Resistance should be considered with maternal history of antibiotics during pregnancyor maternal ESBL-E cultured. Empirical treatment should be based on maternal isolates, although if unable to access these, gentamicin is usually sufficient. For prolonged stays in neonatal intensive care, resistant hospital pathogens, including MRSA, should be considered with empirical vancomycin if the infant is severely unwell.

Once culture results are available, empiric antibiotics can be targeted and potentially narrowed.

Antibiotic Duration and Timing of IV to Oral Switch

For most children with cUTI, there is not enough evidence to support varying from current practice and expert opinion recommending a total of 10–14 days (GRADE D).
When IV antibiotics are started, recommended IV durations vary between ≤ 3 days and ≤ 7 days depending on the cUTI subgroup and presence of bacteremia, with an early switch when the child is afebrile and clinically well (GRADES C and D).
Longer total durations (up to 21 days) may be needed for renal abscesses or nephronia, and renal USS is recommended after 14 days to determine progress and ultimate antibiotic duration (GRADE B).
For frequently relapsing UTI with the same organism, investigations should assess for an ongoing focal source of infection (GRADE D).
Shorter total durations (6–9 days) and a single dose IV component show early promise, but prospective studies are needed with more children with complicated UTI (GRADES C and D).

### Urinary tract infections: epidemiology, mechanisms of infection and treatment options [^1215154d]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a severe public health problem and are caused by a range of pathogens, but most commonly by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. High recurrence rates and increasing antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens threaten to greatly increase the economic burden of these infections. In this Review, we discuss how basic science studies are elucidating the molecular details of the crosstalk that occurs at the host-pathogen interface, as well as the consequences of these interactions for the pathophysiology of UTIs. We also describe current efforts to translate this knowledge into new clinical treatments for UTIs.

For children with severe clinical presentation with sepsis features and no previous risk factors for resistance, E. coli is the most common pathogen, followed by Klebsiella, Enterococcus, Proteus and Pseudomonas spp. Treatment with broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics such as third-generation cephalosporins is recommended in moderately unwell children. If a child is severely unwell with sepsis potentially of urinary origin, local sepsis guidelines should be followed, considering the individual child's risk and/or history of resistance and whether it is hospital-acquired. There is occasionally a case for using empirical carbapenems in children with cUTI, for example, in a child with sepsis and a history of highly resistant organisms. This should be in consultation with an infectious diseases specialist to tailor empirical treatment and switch, when possible, with susceptibility.

For nephronia/renal abscess, E. coli is the most common pathogen, but urine culture is frequently negative. Since urine culture may not identify the organism or its susceptibility, if progress is poor, penicillin/ampicillin may be added to cover Enterococcus spp. Early consultation with infectious diseases and urology is also recommended in case abscess drainage is needed. In specific clinical circumstances, S. aureus (including MRSA), C. albicans and Mycobacterium tuberculosis may cause renal abscess.

Children with nonurologic underlying conditions have different risks of unusual organisms and resistance depending on hospitalization and antibiotic exposure. In children postrenal transplant, especially with urological abnormalities, there is a greater likelihood of Enterococcus spp. S. aureus or P. aeruginosa. In immunocompromised patients, in addition to Enterobacterales and P. aeruginosa, less virulent organisms such as CoNS, Haemophilus influenzae and group B streptococcus may cause cUTI. Fungal infections and viruses, for example, adenovirus, can also infect the urinary tract. Choice of antibiotic in chronic renal impairment, immunocompromise or other chronic disease (eg, diabetes mellitus), therefore, depends on likely pathogens and risk of antibiotic resistance based on past antibiotic use and hospitalization. Mild acute or chronic renal impairment does not preclude use of aminoglycosides, which are generally well tolerated in children with renal dosing adjustment. Blood levels should be monitored closely. In moderate/severe renal failure, aminoglycosides should be used only when there is no alternative, as there is a higher risk of accumulation and an unknown risk to hearing.

### Urinary tract infections [^329c6996]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the second most common bacterial infection in children and is considered a public health threat given the mounting rates of antibiotic-resistance among uropathogens. This article highlights recent encouraging developments in UTI research. Further work is necessary to translate the discoveries into accessible, cost-effective technologies that will aid clinicians in real-time decision-making.

### Consensus position statement on advancing the classification of patients and tests of cure in studies of antibiotic treatment of complicated urinary tract infections [^1ec6abc3]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infections denote an important research field for new antibiotics against Gram-negative pathogens. There is, however, increasing concern that this disease entity is too vaguely defined, leading to heterogeneous study populations and risk of bias. We analysed researchers' adherence to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and assessed risk of bias using a three-step procedure: literature review of full-text articles on complicated urinary tract infection; assessment of the importance of risk factors for treatment failure, including statistical evaluation of how patients with risk factors might skew treatment effects; and a Delphi consensus process in a multidisciplinary group. Our evaluation showed poor adherence to FDA guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and significant heterogeneity in the reporting of study, patient, and pathogen characteristics, leading to a high risk of bias when interpreting and comparing study findings. We therefore question the concept of complicated urinary tract infection as a meaningful entity with its own study guidance.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^27a3e613]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics pediatric UTI diagnosis — Action Statement 1 states that "the clinician should ensure that a urine specimen is obtained for both culture and urinalysis before an antimicrobial agent is administered; the specimen needs to be obtained through catheterization or SPA, because the diagnosis of UTI cannot be established reliably through culture of urine collected in a bag" (evidence quality: A; strong recommendation). Urine obtained through catheterization for culture has "a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 99%," and SPA success rates have been "reported (23%–90%)" with improvement "when ultrasonographic guidance is used." For bag-collected urine, cultures "have an unacceptably high false-positive rate and are valid only when they yield negative results"; at a "prevalence of UTI of 5%" and "specificity: ~63%," a positive bag culture "would be a false-positive result 88% of the time," and in febrile boys at "2%" prevalence the false-positive rate "is 95%;" for circumcised boys at "0.2%," it "is 99%." Therefore, "in cases in which antimicrobial therapy will be initiated, catheterization or SPA is required to establish the diagnosis of UTI." Supporting judgments include "Aggregate quality of evidence: A (diagnostic studies on relevant populations)," "Harms/risks/costs: Catheterization is invasive," "Benefit-harms assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm," and the value judgment that "it is important to have the most-accurate test for UTI performed initially."

### Urinary tract infections in children: treatment [^a9471dc2]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection is a frequent diagnosis in children who are referred to the urologist. Infections vary in scope and severity, warranting thoughtful consideration of appropriate therapy. Infections of the genitourinary system may include bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic microorganisms. Adequate therapy requires rapid detection and control of these conditions to prevent pyelonephritic renal scarring and its sequelae.
