## Question

Does Bactrim cover Enterococcus faecalis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Bactrim (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, TMP‑SMX) covers Enterococcus faecalis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what authoritative regulatory sources (e.g. FDA labeling/monographs) say about Enterococcus susceptibility to trimethoprim or TMP‑SMX. Then, I should verify whether major clinical guidelines for enterococcal infections ever recommend TMP‑SMX. Next, I will consider the resistance biology of enterococci that could explain any discordance between in vitro results and clinical outcomes. Finally, I will synthesize the bottom line and suggest agents with proven efficacy if TMP‑SMX is unreliable.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory position, because that typically clarifies whether any apparent in vitro activity translates to the bedside. The FDA trimethoprim monograph explicitly states that Enterococcus spp. (including E. faecalis) may appear active in vitro but are not clinically effective and should not be reported as susceptible, which is a strong directive against considering Enterococcus truly susceptible to trimethoprim in clinical practice [^notfound].

> Wait, I should also check the approved organism lists in the Bactrim/Sulfatrim labels for common indications like urinary tract infections to see if Enterococcus faecalis appears there. Enterococcus is conspicuously absent; these labels list organisms such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. Enterobacter spp. Morganella morganii, and Proteus spp., but not Enterococcus faecalis, which supports that TMP‑SMX is not an indicated or reliable agent for enterococcal infections [^116Fq6DA] [^1143uW9h] [^113f8eW1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — perhaps guidelines for enterococcal endocarditis mention TMP‑SMX somewhere? I need to check. The 2023 ESC endocarditis guidelines recommend ampicillin or amoxicillin plus ceftriaxone or gentamicin for non‑HLAR E. faecalis and, for resistant enterococci (including VRE), options like high‑dose daptomycin often combined with β‑lactams or fosfomycin; TMP‑SMX does not appear as a recommended regimen in these settings, aligning with the FDA stance that clinical efficacy is lacking [^111La9pf] [^117JMtzR].

> Next, I should review additional clinical data to ensure I'm not missing a niche role. Let me verify outcomes literature in E. faecalis endocarditis: evidence favors β‑lactam–based combination therapy (e.g., ampicillin‑gentamicin or ampicillin‑ceftriaxone), with relapse data also supporting these strategies; again, TMP‑SMX is notably absent from effective regimens and is not highlighted as an alternative, which further argues against its reliability for E. faecalis [^1133wAFB].

> I will now examine whether enterococcal coverage is needed in other syndromes, such as intra‑abdominal infections, and whether TMP‑SMX is considered when coverage is indicated. Guidelines recommending enterococcal coverage in selected high‑risk intra‑abdominal infections suggest ampicillin or vancomycin for E. faecalis when needed; TMP‑SMX is not included among recommended agents for such targeted enterococcal therapy, reinforcing its lack of a role for E. faecalis in these settings [^115zPStC] [^115TxeUH].

> But wait, what if in vitro susceptibility occasionally looks favorable — could that justify use in select cases like UTIs? The FDA's specific warning that Enterococcus spp. may test as "susceptible" in vitro but are not clinically effective means we should not rely on such results for clinical decision-making; moreover, the absence of Enterococcus from TMP‑SMX product labeling for UTIs underscores that even in urinary isolates, TMP‑SMX should not be considered reliable for E. faecalis [^112xDiHY] [^116Fq6DA].

> Let me consider mechanistic plausibility for the discordance between in vitro and in vivo activity. Enterococci possess extensive intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms and unique cell wall physiology that collectively limit the efficacy of many antimicrobials; this resistance landscape helps explain why in vitro findings can mislead and why clinical outcomes have not validated TMP‑SMX against E. faecalis [^114X9MPA] [^116jZYSq].

> Hmm, wait a minute — initially one might argue TMP‑SMX is "broad" and often active against Gram‑positive pathogens, so perhaps it could help with enterococci; however, that generalization is incorrect here, and the more I cross‑check, the clearer it is that both regulatory guidance and clinical practice guidelines consistently exclude TMP‑SMX for E. faecalis treatment, favoring ampicillin for susceptible strains and agents like vancomycin, daptomycin, or linezolid when resistance or intolerance necessitates alternatives [^112xDiHY] [^111La9pf] [^117JMtzR].

> Bottom line: I should conclude that TMP‑SMX does not provide clinically reliable activity against Enterococcus faecalis. While occasional in vitro susceptibility may appear, the FDA explicitly advises that Enterococcus should not be reported as susceptible to trimethoprim, TMP‑SMX is not listed for Enterococcus in product labels, and major guidelines do not recommend it for enterococcal infections; instead, use agents with proven efficacy such as ampicillin (if susceptible), vancomycin, high‑dose daptomycin (often in combination), or linezolid, guided by site of infection and susceptibility results [^112xDiHY] [^116Fq6DA] [^1143uW9h] [^111La9pf] [^117JMtzR].

---

No, Bactrim (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) is **not effective** against Enterococcus faecalis because E. faecalis is intrinsically resistant to trimethoprim and sulfonamides [^112xDiHY], and clinical failure is expected even if in vitro testing suggests susceptibility. Bactrim is **not recommended** for enterococcal infections; use ampicillin or amoxicillin for susceptible strains [^111Jpnv9], and vancomycin, daptomycin, or linezolid for resistant strains.

---

## Intrinsic resistance of enterococcus faecalis to bactrim

- **Intrinsic resistance**: E. faecalis is intrinsically resistant to trimethoprim and sulfonamides, the components of Bactrim [^112xDiHY].

- **Mechanisms of resistance**: Resistance mechanisms include reduced cell wall permeability, overproduction of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and plasmid-mediated trimethoprim-resistant DHFR enzymes [^112xDiHY] [^115N4M25].

- **Clinical implications**: Despite occasional in vitro susceptibility, clinical failure is expected, and Bactrim should not be used for E. faecalis infections [^112xDiHY] [^115u6CNy].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines **do not recommend Bactrim** for enterococcal infections due to intrinsic resistance and lack of clinical efficacy [^112xDiHY] [^117UXbiE]. Preferred antibiotics include **ampicillin or amoxicillin** as first-line for susceptible E. faecalis [^111Jpnv9], with **vancomycin** [^111La9pf], **daptomycin** [^115M47hV], or **linezolid** used for resistant strains [^117JMtzR].

---

## Clinical scenarios and outcomes

- **Urinary tract infections (UTIs)**: Bactrim is ineffective for E. faecalis UTIs due to intrinsic resistance [^112xDiHY].

- **Endocarditis**: Bactrim is not recommended for enterococcal endocarditis; combination therapy with ampicillin and ceftriaxone or gentamicin is preferred [^111La9pf] [^1133wAFB].

- **Other infections**: Bactrim is ineffective for other E. faecalis infections, including bacteremia and intra-abdominal infections [^112xDiHY] [^115TxeUH].

---

## Alternative antibiotics for enterococcus faecalis infections

| **Antibiotic** | **Indication** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|
| Ampicillin or amoxicillin | First-line for susceptible strains | Highly effective [^111Jpnv9] |
| Vancomycin | Ampicillin-resistant strains | Effective alternative [^111La9pf] |
| Daptomycin | Resistant strains; including VRE | High-dose recommended [^117JMtzR] [^115M47hV] |
| Linezolid | Resistant strains; including VRE | Effective alternative [^117JMtzR] |
| Gentamicin (adjunctive) | Combination therapy for endocarditis | Used with ampicillin or vancomycin [^111La9pf] |

---

## Clinical risks and considerations

- **Treatment failure**: Using Bactrim for E. faecalis risks clinical failure and complications [^112xDiHY].

- **Resistance development**: Inappropriate use can promote resistance and limit future options [^1136cCih].

- **Adverse effects**: Bactrim can cause hematologic toxicity, hypersensitivity, and renal impairment, especially in vulnerable patients [^1143uW9h] [^113ffv6a].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

Bactrim is **not effective** against E. faecalis due to intrinsic resistance [^112xDiHY] and should not be used for these infections. Use **ampicillin or amoxicillin** for susceptible strains [^111Jpnv9], and **vancomycin, daptomycin, or linezolid** for resistant strains [^111La9pf] [^117JMtzR].

### Recommendations for systemic antimicrobial therapy in fracture-related infection: A consensus from an international expert group [^111Jpnv9]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2020). Low credibility.

Treatment of enterococcus species involves several considerations. If enterococci, especially Enterococcus faecalis, are sensitive to ampicillin or amoxicillin, these should be the initial agents of choice. Administer up to a week of intravenous therapy, followed by oral amoxicillin.

For ampicillin-resistant enterococci, vancomycin and daptomycin are the first choices. However, resistance to vancomycin is increasing, which results in vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Apart from daptomycin or oral linezolid, often no other alternative options are available. Pristinamycin may be considered for the treatment of E. faecalis, although evidence supporting this is limited for enterococcal implant-related infections.

Intravenous (IV) fosfomycin has extensive tissue penetration in inflamed tissue and bone. In an experimental model of foreign-body infection, the combination of fosfomycin and gentamicin showed good biofilm activity against E. faecalis. Further studies are needed before IV fosfomycin can be recommended as a standard therapy in enterococcal fracture-related infections (FRI), although it may be considered in selected cases. No safety data exist on long-term oral administration of fosfomycin, so this route of administration is not recommended for bone and joint infections.

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of endocarditis [^111La9pf]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for infective endocarditis, specifically concerning antibiotic therapy, the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend administering the combination of ampicillin or amoxicillin with ceftriaxone for 6 weeks, or with gentamicin for 2 weeks, in adult patients with native valve endocarditis (NVE) caused by non-high-level aminoglycoside-resistant Enterococcus species. The following doses are advised:

- **Amoxicillin**: 200 mg/kg/day IV in 4–6 doses.
- **Ampicillin**: 12 g/day IV in 4–6 doses.
- **Ceftriaxone**: 4 g/day IV in 2 doses.
- **Gentamicin**: 3 mg/kg/day IV or IM in 1 dose.

### Trimethoprim [^112xDiHY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Trimethoprim blocks the production of tetrahydrofolic acid from dihydrofolic acid by binding to and reversibly inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. This binding is significantly stronger for the bacterial enzyme compared to the corresponding mammalian enzyme. Consequently, trimethoprim selectively interferes with bacterial biosynthesis of nucleic acids and proteins.

- **Resistance**: Resistance to trimethoprim may arise through various mechanisms, including cell wall impermeability, overproduction of the chromosomal dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) enzyme, production of a resistant chromosomal DHFR enzyme, or production of a plasmid-mediated trimethoprim-resistant DHFR enzyme. Acinetobacter baumannii/Acinetobacter calcoaceticus complex, Burkholderia cepacia complex, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia are intrinsically resistant to trimethoprim. Non-Enterobacteriaceae fecal organisms, Bacteroides spp., and Lactobacillus spp. are not susceptible to trimethoprim at concentrations achieved with the recommended dosage. Enterococcus spp. (E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. gallinarum/E. casseliflavus) may appear active in vitro but are not clinically effective and should not be reported as susceptible. Moraxella catarrhalis isolates have been consistently found to be resistant to trimethoprim.

- **Antimicrobial activity**: Trimethoprim has demonstrated activity against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections, as described in the "Indications and Usage" section.

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of endocarditis [^117JMtzR]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for infective endocarditis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy for resistant enterococci, the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend administering daptomycin combined with β-lactams (ampicillin, ertapenem, or ceftaroline) or fosfomycin. The following doses are suggested for adult patients with infective endocarditis caused by VRE species:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
| Daptomycin | 10–12 mg/kg/day IV in 1 dose |
| Ampicillin | 300 mg/kg/day IV in 4–6 equally divided doses |
| Fosfomycin | 12 g/day IV in 4 doses |
| Ceftaroline | 1,800 mg/day IV in 3 doses |
| Ertapenem | 2 g/day IV or IM in 1 dose |

### Risk factors for trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole-resistant Escherichia coli in ED patients with urinary tract infections [^114CVrxj]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

While trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is recommended as one of the first-line empiric therapies for the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis, institutions that observe resistance rates exceeding 20% for Escherichia coli (E. coli) should utilize alternative empiric antibiotic therapy per the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). Identifying risk factors associated with TMP-SMX resistance in E. coli may help guide empiric antibiotic prescribing for urinary tract infections (UTIs).

- **Methods**: This multicenter, retrospective study included adult patients who were discharged from 12 emergency departments (EDs) with a urine culture positive for E. coli between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2019. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between potential risk factors and TMP-SMX resistance. The overall institutional antimicrobial resistance rates for E. coli were compared to the rates seen in the study population of ED urinary isolates.

- **Results**: Among 427 patients included from a randomized sample of 500 with a urine culture positive for E. coli, 107 (25.1%) were resistant to TMP-SMX. Three predictors of TMP-SMX resistance were identified: recurrent UTIs (reUTI) (OR 2.27 [95% CI 1.27–3.99]), genitourinary abnormalities (OR 2.31 [95% CI 1.17–4.49]), and TMP-SMX use within 90 days (OR 8.77 [95% CI 3.19–28.12]). When the antibiotic susceptibilities for this ED cohort were compared to the institutional antibiogram, the TMP-SMX resistance rate was found to be higher in the ED population (25.1% vs. 20%).

- **Conclusions**: TMP-SMX should likely be avoided in institutions with similar resistance profiles.

### Effectiveness of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for children with chronic active otitis media: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^115e84Wz]. Pediatrics (2007). High credibility.

The goal was to determine the clinical effectiveness of prolonged outpatient treatment with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for children with chronic active otitis media. We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled trial with 101 children (1–12 years of age) with chronic active otitis media (defined as otorrhea for ≥ 12 weeks). In addition to a short course of steroid and antibiotic eardrops, children were randomly assigned to receive 6 to 12 weeks of orally administered trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (18 mg/kg, 2 times per day) or placebo and were monitored for 1 year.

At 6 weeks, 28% of children in the trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole group and 53% of children in the placebo group had otomicroscopic signs of otorrhea. At 12 weeks, these values were 32% and 47%, respectively. At 1 year, the numbers of children with otorrhea were similar in the two groups (25% and 20%, respectively). One child in the trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole group developed a skin rash. Vomiting or diarrhea was reported for 9% of the trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole group and 2% of the placebo group. Pure-tone hearing levels and health-related quality of life improved during the study but did not differ between the trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole group and the placebo group. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated bacteria in the otorrhea samples from both groups.

A 6- to 12-week course of high-dose, orally administered trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole therapy is beneficial for children with chronic active otitis media.

### Population pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole: Dosage optimization for patients with renal insufficiency or receiving continuous renal replacement therapy [^116oAAwA]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Low credibility.

Cotrimoxazole is an antibiotic combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, effective against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. The drug disrupts the production of essential nucleic acids needed for bacterial proliferation and replication by synergistically inhibiting two consecutive enzymatic steps involved in bacterial folinic acid synthesis. It has excellent tissue penetration and is, therefore, used for the treatment of various infections, ranging from infections caused by more resistant pathogens (ESBL+ E. coli, MRSA) to *Pneumocystis jirovecii* pneumonia (PCP).

Trimethoprim is primarily eliminated through nonionic renal diffusion, with 40–75% of the drug recovered unchanged in the urine within 24 hours. Sulfamethoxazole is extensively metabolized into inactive metabolites which are renally excreted. Approximately 16% of sulfamethoxazole is eliminated unchanged and 46% as N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole, the predominant metabolite. Although N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole lacks relevant antibacterial activity, this metabolite has been associated with concentration-dependent toxicity due to accumulation in patients with renal impairment. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is therefore recommended in patients with impaired renal function receiving high-dose cotrimoxazole.

### Does trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis for HIV induce bacterial resistance to other antibiotic classes? Results of a systematic review [^113o2SD7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

The meta-analysis of studies concerning colonization and/or infection with MRSA highlights the potential impact of varying study designs on resistance outcomes. The two cohort studies — considered the most robust — clearly demonstrated reduced MRSA colonization and/or infection, both individually and collectively, whereas the cross-sectional and case-control studies showed no effect.

This literature review encountered several limitations. As TMP-SMX prophylaxis is well-established in saving the lives of HIV-infected patients, only observational studies — which have greater potential for bias and confounding — were available for review. Most studies did not control for known factors that independently increase antibiotic resistance. For instance, only three studies adjusted for HIV disease progression or previous hospitalization, with the latter noted as a key risk factor for colonization or infection with MRSA.

Most studies lacked data on the duration of exposure to TMP-SMX prophylaxis. In those that did report it, the exposure duration was notably shorter than expected in clinical practice, especially in resource-limited settings. Due to the scarcity of antiretroviral therapy in such areas, HIV-infected adults are likely receiving TMP-SMX prophylaxis for significantly longer periods than those evaluated in these studies. Nonetheless, the findings from Gill et al may better apply to HIV-exposed infants, as TMP-SMX was administered per guidelines prevalent in many resource-limited settings.

Furthermore, most studies assessed resistance to only a single antibiotic, complicating a broader understanding of resistance patterns.

### Vancomycin-resistant enterococci: Mechanisms and clinical observations [^114X9MPA]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Enterococci are not generally regarded as highly virulent bacterial pathogens. However, resistance to many antimicrobial drugs complicates the treatment of enterococcal infections. Acquired resistance to high concentrations of glycopeptide antibiotics, specifically vancomycin, has exacerbated this problem. This article seeks to concisely review the mechanisms of that resistance and its effects on the clinical management of enterococcal infections, as well as clinical microbiology and infection control.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance patterns among the United States, 2012–2018 [^111422d3]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Low credibility.

We reviewed trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole antibiotic susceptibility testing data among Staphylococcus aureus using three national inpatient databases. In all three databases, we observed an increase in the percentage of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus that were not susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Providers should select antibiotic regimens based on local resistance patterns and should report changes to the public health department.

### Comparing the cost-effectiveness of linezolid to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole plus rifampicin for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection: a healthcare system perspective [^114HnjkD]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2017). Low credibility.

Few industry-independent studies have been conducted to compare the relative costs and benefits of drugs to treat methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection. We performed a stochastic cost-effectiveness analysis comparing two treatment strategies: linezolid versus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus rifampicin for the treatment of MRSA infection.

- **Methods**: We used cost and effectiveness data from a previously conducted clinical trial, complementing it with other data from published literature, to compare the two regimens from a healthcare system perspective. Effectiveness was expressed in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Several sensitivity analyses were performed using Monte Carlo simulation to measure the effect of potential parameter changes on the base-case model results, including potential differences related to the type of infection and drug toxicity.

- **Results**: Treatment of MRSA infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus rifampicin and linezolid was found to cost, on average, €146 and €2536, and lead to a gain of 0.916 and 0.881 QALYs, respectively. Treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus rifampicin was found to be more cost-effective than linezolid in the base case and remained dominant over linezolid in most alternative scenarios, including different types of MRSA infection and potential disadvantages in terms of toxicity. With a willingness-to-pay threshold of €0, €50,000, and €200,000 per QALY gained, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus rifampicin was dominant in 100%, 96%, and 85% of model iterations.

### Daptomycin in the treatment of enterococcal bloodstream infections and endocarditis: A EUCAST position paper [^115M47hV]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Low credibility.

This position paper describes the view adopted by EUCAST on the role of daptomycin in the treatment of serious infections caused by Enterococcus species.

High-dose daptomycin is considered effective in the treatment of enterococcal bloodstream infection (BSI) and endocarditis, although published clinical experience with the latter condition is limited.

EUCAST reviewed the available published data on pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics (PK-PD), resistance selection, clinical efficacy, and safety for the use of 10–12 mg/kg/day of daptomycin for these conditions. It was noted that the doses licensed by the European Medicines Agency are only 4–6 mg/kg/day, and only for infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus.

- **Findings and recommendations**: The PK-PD evidence shows that, even with doses of 10–12 mg/kg/day, it is not possible to treat infections caused by isolates at the upper end of the wild-type distributions of Enterococcus faecalis (with MICs of 4 mg/L) and E. faecium (with MICs of 4 or 8 mg/L). For this reason, and due to ongoing issues with the reliability of laboratory testing, EUCAST lists daptomycin breakpoints for Enterococcus species as "IE" — insufficient evidence. EUCAST advises increased vigilance in the use of high-dose daptomycin to treat enterococcal BSI and endocarditis. Additional PK-PD studies and prospective efficacy and safety studies of serious Enterococcal infections treated with high-dose daptomycin may permit the setting of breakpoints in the future.

### Empiric use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) in the treatment of women with uncomplicated urinary tract infections, in a geographical area with a high prevalence of TMP-SMX-resistant uropathogens [^114UnsWW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

This study evaluated whether trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is effective for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) due to TMP-SMX-resistant (TMP-SMX-R) pathogens. Healthy nonpregnant premenopausal women with symptomatic lower UTIs were assessed for the presence of pyuria and bacteriuria. If either was present, a urine sample was cultured, and TMP-SMX was prescribed. Clinical and microbiologic cure was assessed at days 5–9 and 28–42 after cessation of therapy.

For 71% of patients, cultures grew TMP-SMX-susceptible (TMP-SMX-S) microorganisms, and for 29%, cultures grew TMP-SMX-R organisms. Escherichia coli remained the predominant bacterium in both groups of cultures.

- **Microbiological cure results**: At visit 2, microbiological cure had been achieved in 86% of the patients in the TMP-SMX-S group and 42% of those in the TMP-SMX-R group. Similar differences were found at visit 3 by clinical evaluation.

Treatment with TMP-SMX of uncomplicated UTI caused by TMP-SMX-R microorganisms results in microbiologic and clinical failure. In high-resistance areas, TMP-SMX should not be the empiric drug of choice for uncomplicated UTI.

### Pathogenesis and immunity in enterococcal infections [^11613VYN]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2010). Low credibility.

Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium have emerged as multi-resistant nosocomial pathogens in immunocompromised and critically ill patients. Multi-resistant strains have acquired virulence genes, resulting in hospital-adapted clones. This review summarizes several proteins and carbohydrate- or glycoconjugates that have been identified as putative virulence factors involved in the pathogenesis of enterococcal infections and may be used as targets for alternative therapies. Several studies describing the host immune response against enterococci are also summarized.

### Fluoroquinolones versus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for the treatment of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113pyRbi]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2019). Low credibility.

Fluoroquinolones are a popular alternative to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infections.

- **Objectives**: To compare the effects of fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole on mortality of S. maltophilia infections.

- **Data sources**: PubMed and EMBASE.

- **Study eligibility criteria**: Clinical studies reporting mortality outcomes of S. maltophilia infections.

- **Participants**: Patients with clinical infections caused by S. maltophilia.

- **Interventions**: Fluoroquinolone monotherapy in comparison with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole monotherapy.

- **Methods**: Systematic review with a meta-analysis technique.

- **Results**: Seven retrospective cohort and seven case-control studies were included. Three cohort studies were designed to compare the two drugs, whereas others had other purposes. A total of 663 patients were identified, 332 of which were treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (50.1%) and 331 with fluoroquinolones (49.9%). Levofloxacin was most frequently used among fluoroquinolones (187/331, 56.5%), followed by ciprofloxacin (114/331, 34.4%). The overall mortality rate was 29.6%. Using pooled ORs for the mortality of each study, fluoroquinolone treatment (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.39–0.99) was associated with a survival benefit over trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment, with low heterogeneity (I² = 18%). Specific fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.17–1.12) and levofloxacin (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.48–1.26) did not show statistically significant differences.

### Trimethoprim [^112ufByz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of trimethoprim tablets, USP, as well as other antibacterial drugs, trimethoprim tablets, USP, should be used only to treat or prevent infections proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empirical selection of therapy.

For the treatment of initial episodes of uncomplicated urinary tract infections, trimethoprim is effective against susceptible strains of the following organisms: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter species, and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species, including S. saprophyticus.

Cultures and susceptibility tests should be performed to determine the susceptibility of the bacteria to trimethoprim. Therapy may be initiated prior to obtaining the results of these tests.

### Population pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole: Dosage optimization for patients with renal insufficiency or receiving continuous renal replacement therapy [^114C6Hbr]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Low credibility.

Compared with other antibiotics, the pharmacodynamics of cotrimoxazole are poorly understood. It is unclear which pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) index (fT > MIC, Cmax > MIC, or AUC/MIC) best correlates with the efficacy of cotrimoxazole. Target concentrations for trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole are predominantly based on theoretical assumptions and in vitro measurements rather than an association with clinical outcomes. For the treatment of PCP, target concentrations for sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim have been suggested and used in both research and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) in clinical practice. Specifically, sulfamethoxazole peak concentrations above 100 mg/L and trimethoprim concentrations above 5 mg/L are recommended. These targets are originally based on two small studies.

The first study included 26 children with PCP and found that 3–5 mg/L for trimethoprim and 100–150 mg/L for sulfamethoxazole resulted in clinical effectiveness. The other study included eight adults with PCP and reported that trimethoprim concentrations below 5.5 mg/L were linked to treatment failure. The concentrations associated with toxicity have been studied more extensively: concentrations of sulfamethoxazole > 200 mg/L, N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole > 75 mg/L, and trimethoprim > 15 mg/L are associated with toxicity both in healthy individuals as well as in patients with PCP. Concentration-dependent adverse events that have been described include hematological toxicity, hyperkalemia, renal failure, and central nervous system adverse effects.

### Response to emerging infection leading to outbreak of linezolid-resistant enterococci [^116W7iTB]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Enterococci are common inhabitants of the human gastrointestinal tract. Although more than 40 enterococcus species exist, nosocomial infections are primarily caused by Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. Enterococcal infections are the third most common cause of nosocomial infection in intensive care units (ICUs), and multidrug-resistant enterococcal infections have been associated with higher hospitalization costs and a higher number of related deaths.

Linezolid, one of the oxazolidinone class of antimicrobial drugs, inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S subunit of 23S rRNA. In April 2000, linezolid was approved in the United States and has been heavily marketed to treat methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) infections. Although more expensive than vancomycin, linezolid does not require testing for adequate serum drug concentrations or dosing adjustment for renal or hepatic insufficiency, and it has been regarded by some healthcare providers as more effective than vancomycin in treating nosocomial pneumonia and MRSA skin and soft tissue infections. Most reports of linezolid-resistant enterococci (LRE) have been individual cases or small case series or have specifically described linezolid-resistant and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (LRVRE). We describe a large hospital outbreak of LRE infections.

### SPL drug information for trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole [^1136cCih]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole IV (also known as Bactrim, Sulfatrim, Septra):

- **Antimicrobial resistance**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as the use of TMP/SMX in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection increases the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria.

- **Blood dyscrasias**: TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and other blood dyscrasias. Maintain a high level of suspicion.

- **C. difficile infection**: Nearly all antibiotics, including TMP/SMX, are associated with an increased risk of C. difficile-associated diarrhea. Maintain a high level of suspicion.

- **Crystalluria**: TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of crystalluria. Ensure adequate fluid intake and urinary output while maintaining a high level of suspicion.

- **Decreased blood glucose**: TMP/SMX has been associated with rare cases of hypoglycemia, especially in patients with renal dysfunction, liver disease, malnutrition, or those receiving high doses of TMP/SMX. Maintain a high level of suspicion.

- **Decreased platelet count**: TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of drug-induced thrombocytopenia. Maintain a high level of suspicion.

- **Decreased serum sodium**: TMP/SMX can cause severe and symptomatic hyponatremia. Maintain a high level of suspicion.

- **Hemolysis**: Use caution in patients with G6PD deficiency.

- **Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis**: TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Maintain a high level of suspicion.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus vancomycin for severe infections caused by meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus: randomised controlled trial [^117WdUri]. BMJ (2015). High credibility.

Study outcomes were presented in the form of risk ratios (95% CI) for categorical variables and median differences (95% CI) for continuous outcomes.

- **Methodology**: The study used ITT (intention to treat) and PP (per protocol) analysis. All other outcomes were reported by intention to treat. Failure at day 7 or deviation from the assigned regimen in the first seven days of treatment was noted.

- **Findings**: Hospital admission duration was reported only for patients discharged alive. One patient in each group developed a TMP-SMZ-resistant MRSA isolate. Additionally, three patients on TMP-SMZ and five on vancomycin developed carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae colonization. No vancomycin-intermediate or resistant S. aureus or vancomycin-resistant enterococcal isolates were found.

- **Mortality analysis**: All-cause 30-day mortality did not differ significantly between the groups. Among patients with bacteraemia, mortality was nearly twice as high with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (14/41, 34%) compared to vancomycin (9/50, 18%) [risk ratio 1.90, 0.92 to 3.93]. For non-bacteraemic patients, mortality rates were low and not significantly different (5/94, 5% vs. 4/67, 6%) [risk ratio 0.89, 0.25 to 3.2].

### Does trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis for HIV induce bacterial resistance to other antibiotic classes? Results of a systematic review [^116gcvqq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) prophylaxis has long been recommended for immunosuppressed HIV-infected adults and children born to HIV-infected women. Despite this, many resource-limited countries have not implemented this recommendation, partly because of the fear of widespread antimicrobial resistance not only to TMP-SMX but also to other antibiotics. We aimed to determine whether TMP-SMX prophylaxis in HIV-infected and/or exposed individuals increases bacterial resistance to antibiotics other than TMP-SMX.

- **Methods**: A literature search was conducted in Medline, Global Health, Embase, Web of Science, ELDIS, and ID21.

- **Results**: A total of 501 studies were identified, and 17 met the inclusion criteria. Only 8 studies were of high quality, of which only 2 had been specifically designed to answer this question. Studies were classified as (1) studies in which all participants were infected and/or colonized and in which rates of bacterial resistance were compared between those taking or not taking TMP-SMX and (2) studies comparing those who had a resistant infection with those who were not infected. Type 1 studies showed weak evidence that TMP-SMX protects against resistance. Type 2 studies provided more convincing evidence that TMP-SMX protects against infection.

- **Conclusion**: There was some evidence that TMP-SMX prophylaxis protects against resistance to other antibiotics. However, more carefully designed studies are needed to answer the question conclusively.

### A comprehensive review of abdominal infections [^115zPStC]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Use of antibiotic therapy for Enterococcus in intra-abdominal infections (IAI) is controversial. Enterococcus is often isolated from IAI and is associated with an increased risk of treatment failure and higher mortality. However, outcomes in these patients have been shown to be independent of antibiotic coverage for Enterococcus. Currently, the general consensus regarding enterococcal coverage is that community-acquired infections require no coverage. However, ampicillin or vancomycin should be added to cover the following high-risk patient groups:

1. Patients in septic shock who have received prolonged treatment with cephalosporins or other antibiotics that select for Enterococcus.
2. Immunocompromised patients.
3. Patients with prosthetic heart valves or other intravascular prosthetic devices.
4. Patients with health care-associated or recurrent intra-abdominal infection.

Vancomycin-resistant enterococcal (VRE) infections occur in patients who are immunocompromised, previously colonized with VRE, or treated with vancomycin. In these circumstances, VRE should be suspected and treated with alternatives such as linezolid, tigecycline, or daptomycin. In the absence of these risk factors, specific coverage for VRE is not recommended.

Candida is similar to Enterococcus in that isolation of Candida from intra-abdominal cultures is associated with increased mortality. However, antifungal treatment has not been shown to alter this risk. Therefore, fungal coverage is unnecessary unless the patient is immunocompromised or has a severe IAI with Candida grown from intra-abdominal cultures.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus vancomycin for severe infections caused by meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus: randomised controlled trial [^112Wx9eX]. BMJ (2015). High credibility.

We used a central computer-generated random number list to randomise patients to treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or vancomycin. Allocation was concealed in sealed, opaque numbered envelopes that were opened consecutively after informed consent was obtained. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was started intravenously at a dose of 320 mg trimethoprim/1600 mg sulfamethoxazole twice daily and could be switched to oral treatment using the same dose at the discretion of the treating physician. Dosing was based on a pharmacokinetic study showing that a lower dose resulted in inhibition but not killing of S aureus and on the dose used in a previous trial. The vancomycin starting dose was 1 g twice daily. In both arms, treatment was adjusted to renal function; in the vancomycin arm, it was directed by serum concentrations to obtain drug trough concentrations between 10 and 20 mg/dL. The complete study protocol is available on request. Treatment had to be administered for a minimum of seven days, following which the duration depended on the indication. Concomitant antibiotics, other than the combination of vancomycin and co-trimoxazole, could be administered. After randomisation, no blinding was performed, but outcomes were adjudicated blinded to allocation.

### Multicenter evaluation of the novel ETEST fosfomycin for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Enterobacterales, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus species [^116dbYGx]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2022). Low credibility.

- **Clinical study**: The ETEST FO performance was evaluated using CLSI/FDA breakpoints and FDA requirements. Comparative analysis included a total of 152 and 201 samples at the three study sites. We assessed performance using CLSI/FDA breakpoints and FDA acceptance criteria. The performance demonstrated an essential agreement (EA) of 98.0% (149/152) and a categorical agreement (CA) of 93.4% (142/152). There were 0% very major errors (VME) or major errors (ME), and 6.6% (10/152) minor errors. Of the clinical isolates, 18 were categorized as intermediate, and two isolates were resistant. The results met all FDA performance criteria.

	- The results showed 91.0% EA (183/201) and 99.0% CA (199/201), with 0% VME (0/14), 0% ME (0/183), and 1% (2/201) minor errors. According to CLSI/FDA breakpoints, four strains were categorized as intermediate, and 14 were resistant.

- **ETEST FO performance with EUCAST breakpoints and ISO requirements**: The analysis was based on comparing the results to the ISO performance criteria. A total of 201 clinical isolates were analyzed with EUCAST breakpoints for intravenous (i.v.) and oral use. For i.v. use, an EA and CA of 91.0% (183/201) and 97.0% (195/201) were achieved. Three ME (1.7%, 3/177) and three VME (12.5%, 3/24) were observed among isolates. For these VME, the ETEST FO showed a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 32 μg/mL while the direct assay (AD) showed a MIC of 64 μg/mL. The VME were one dilution apart.

### New insights into the antimicrobial effect of mast cells against Enterococcus faecalis [^115huRJv]. Infection and Immunity (2014). Low credibility.

Enterococcus faecalis has emerged as an important cause of life-threatening multidrug-resistant bacterial infections in hospital settings. The pathogenesis of enterococcal infections has remained relatively neglected, despite its obvious clinical relevance. This study aimed to characterize the interactions between mast cells (MCs), an innate immune cell population abundant in the intestinal lamina propria, and E. faecalis. Conducted with primary bone marrow-derived murine MCs, the results demonstrated that MCs exert an antimicrobial effect against E. faecalis mediated both by degranulation, with the concomitant discharge of the antimicrobial effectors contained in the granules, and by the release of extracellular traps in which E. faecalis was snared and killed.

In particular, the cathelicidin LL-37 released by the MCs had a potent antimicrobial effect against E. faecalis. The study also investigated the specific receptors involved in the recognition of E. faecalis by MCs, identifying Toll-like receptors (TLRs) as critically involved in the MC recognition of E. faecalis. MCs deficient in the expression of MyD88, an adaptor molecule required for signaling by most TLRs, were significantly impaired in their capacity to degranulate, to reduce E. faecalis growth, and to release tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) after encountering this pathogen. Furthermore, TLR2 was identified as the most prominent TLR involved in the recognition of E. faecalis by MCs.

### Host-dependent resistance of group A Streptococcus to sulfamethoxazole mediated by a horizontally-acquired reduced folate transporter [^116v1Zqo]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major threat to global human health, recently estimated to directly cause 1.27 million deaths per year. Genomic surveillance of AMR is one of the strategies outlined by the World Health Organization to mitigate the burden of AMR infections and guide the optimal use of existing antibiotics. Surveillance is facilitated by online databases of AMR genes and mutations, each defined by their ability to confer direct resistance to antibiotics in vitro. These generally fall into four canonical mechanisms: antibiotic inactivation, reduced antibiotic accumulation, target expression changes, and target protection (including acquisition of functional targets with reduced antibiotic affinity). While new antibiotic resistance genes are continually being identified, the underlying mechanisms of resistance almost exclusively fall into these four canonical mechanisms. However, existing AMR genes and mutations do not explain all antibiotic-resistant infections.

The folate biosynthesis pathway has been a target for antibiotic therapy for over 80 years. The end products of this pathway, 7,8-dihydrofolate (DHF) and 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate (THF), are key intermediates in the folate cycle required for the production of deoxythymidine monophosphate. As mammals lack the enzymes required for de novo folate synthesis, they must acquire reduced folate cycle intermediates from dietary sources. The most common antifolate antibiotic therapy is a highly synergistic combination of two antibiotics that simultaneously inhibit…

### Multicenter evaluation of the novel ETEST fosfomycin for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Enterobacterales, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus species [^1142q1PF]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2022). Low credibility.

Fosfomycin is a phosphonic acid derivative active against a wide spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. It is used for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uUTI) or severe infections by oral or intravenous (i.v.) administration. To improve its performance and robustness, the fosfomycin strip, an antibiotic gradient diffusion strip, was redeveloped and evaluated in the multicenter study summarized in this paper.

ETEST fosfomycin (ETEST FO) clinical performance was evaluated by three study sites on 152 Enterococcus faecalis, 100 Staphylococcus spp., and 330 Enterobacterales in comparison with the CLSI and EUCAST agar dilution reference methods. Referring to FDA performance criteria, the ETEST FO achieved 91.0% of essential agreement (EA) and 99.0% of categorical agreement (CA) for Escherichia coli. Additionally, 98.0% EA and 93.4% CA were achieved for E. faecalis, with no very major errors (VME) or major errors (ME). According to EUCAST breakpoints for intravenous fosfomycin use, Enterobacterales and Staphylococcus spp. also met ISO acceptance criteria for EA and CA (EA 91.5% and 94.0%, respectively, and CA 98.0% for both).

A VME rate of 8.8% was observed for Enterobacterales, but the MICs were within EA. There was a trend to predict lower MICs for Citrobacter spp. E. coli, and Salmonella enterica and to predict higher MICs for Klebsiella pneumoniae. ETEST FO should not be used for Enterobacter cloacae due to low EA and a high VME rate. The study results support the efficiency of the novel ETEST FO, making it easy-to-handle for clinical applications.

### Dose dependence of emergence of resistance to linezolid in Enterococcus faecalis in vivo [^112UWcxH]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

The emergence of resistance to antibiotics in vivo, particularly in commensal, potentially pathogenic bacteria, is a factor that is key to the future of antibiotics. To better document the circumstances favoring the emergence of resistance to linezolid (the first of a new class of antibiotics, the oxazolidinones), we modeled the effect of different regimens of linezolid on Enterococcus faecalis in gnotobiotic mice.

- **Methods**: We studied the rate of emergence of linezolid-resistant E. faecalis mutants in the digestive tract of gnotobiotic mice monoassociated with linezolid-susceptible E. faecalis and fed with water containing linezolid (0.5, 0.05, or 0.005 g/L). 23S Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) mutations were characterized by sequencing each of the four copies of the rRNA genes individually.

- **Results**: Mutants were readily obtained in vivo, but the frequencies, persistence, and type of mutants were all dependent on the linezolid regimen. Mutations conferring resistance, either the G2505A or G2576U mutation, were present in domain V of the 23S rRNA gene of all resistant isolates. Levels of resistance increased with the number of mutated copies of the 23S rRNA gene and with duration of exposure.

- **Conclusion**: The antibiotic dose appears to be critical in the dynamics and molecular basis of resistance.

### Does trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis for HIV induce bacterial resistance to other antibiotic classes? Results of a systematic review [^114oUcbz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

In contrast to type 1 studies, type 2 studies provided stronger evidence that TMP-SMX prophylaxis protects against infection with drug-resistant bacteria. Four studies, all considered of good quality, reported reduced infection and/or colonization with MRSA. One study, also of good quality, reported no change in colonization with MRSA. The two lower-quality studies in this group reported increased MRSA. The meta-analysis of MRSA cohort studies revealed a 70% protective effect of TMP-SMX prophylaxis against MRSA infection (relative risk, .29; 95% confidence interval, .12–.7).

It is plausible that TMP-SMX prophylaxis protects against infection with drug-resistant bacteria. TMP-SMX may directly protect against colonization and/or infection with drug-susceptible bacterial pathogens. Indirect protection can arise as individuals are less exposed to conditions that increase the risk for infection and/or colonization with drug-resistant bacteria. For example, decreased need for frequent hospitalization and less exposure to intravenous catheters, which have been shown to increase antibiotic resistance, may result from TMP-SMX prophylaxis. Consequently, patients may be less likely to receive other antibiotics for the treatment of infections, and such exposure to antibiotics has been shown to increase antibiotic resistance.

The finding by Gill et al. that pneumococcal resistance to one of five antibiotics increased, whereas there was no change in the resistance levels for the other four drugs, might suggest that it is possible for TMP-SMX prophylaxis to influence antibiotic resistance patterns.

### Does trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis for HIV induce bacterial resistance to other antibiotic classes? Results of a systematic review [^114DjdCU]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

A total of 501 studies were identified, of which 17 remained eligible for inclusion. The process for identifying these eligible publications is detailed in Figure 1.

- **Description of studies**: Six cohort studies, four case-control studies, six cross-sectional studies, and one before-after study met the eligibility criteria. These studies were conducted in several countries: six in the United States, four in South Africa, two in Italy, and one each in Kenya, Zambia, Singapore, Spain, and France.

Only two studies were specifically designed to determine whether TMP-SMX prophylaxis increases antibiotic resistance. The remaining studies examined this question as part of sub-analyses designed to answer different primary questions.

There were two comparison groups for bacterial resistance to antibiotics other than TMP-SMX. The first group consisted of studies where all participants were infected and/or colonized, comparing rates of bacterial resistance between those taking TMP-SMX and those who were not. Most of these studies reported on pneumococcal resistance to penicillin. The second group compared those with a resistant infection/colonization to those who were not infected/colonized. Most of these studies focused on infection and/or colonization with MRSA.

- **Description of the quality of studies**: Studies that did not control for confounders such as stage of HIV disease, prior hospitalization, and previous antibiotic use were deemed to be of poorer quality. Only eight of the 17 studies were considered.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus vancomycin for severe infections caused by meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus: Randomised controlled trial [^1148NgjB]. BMJ (2015). Low credibility.

Few randomised controlled trials have assessed the effectiveness of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for the treatment of staphylococcal infections. A single randomised controlled trial compared trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole against vancomycin for staphylococcal infections. The trial randomised 228 intravenous drug users with suspected staphylococcal infections and analysed 101 with proven infections (54 with meticillin susceptible S. aureus and 47 with MRSA). Vancomycin was superior to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole among patients with meticillin susceptible S. aureus infections, but no differences were observed for patients with MRSA.

Specifically, the bacteraemia duration (total 57 patients) was longer with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment for meticillin susceptible S. aureus (7.8 vs. 3.5 days; P = 0.05) and similar for MRSA (5.2 vs. 5.6 days). The authors concluded that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is a valuable alternative for the treatment of MRSA infections, unlike the conclusions of our study. However, the study included significantly younger and less ill patients, with a single death compared with the 13% mortality rate in our study.

In a recent randomised controlled trial, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole combined with rifampin was compared with linezolid in the treatment of MRSA infections (bacteraemia in 18/150 (12%) and mortality in 14/150 (9%)), showing no differences in failure/relapse rates or mortality. Among 50 patients with chronic meticillin susceptible S. aureus osteomyelitis randomised to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-rifampin versus…

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: Recommendations by the Italian council for the optimization of antimicrobial use [^115TxeUH]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

An extensive literature review demonstrated some evidence in favor of using empirical therapy with enterococcal coverage for intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) in the following cases: 1) immunocompromised patients or patients with hospital-acquired/post-operative complicated IAIs (cIAIs); 2) patients with cIAIs who have previously received cephalosporins and other broad-spectrum antibiotics selecting Enterococcus spp.; 3) patients with cIAIs and valvular heart disease or prosthetic intravascular material, who are at high risk of endocarditis. The ideal therapeutic regimen for these high-risk patients remains to be determined, but empirical therapy directed against enterococci should be considered.

Nearly all strains of Enterococcus faecalis, including some strains of vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis, are susceptible to ampicillin. In patients with IAIs, Enterococcus faecium is increasingly encountered, particularly in patients with hospital-acquired IAIs. In contrast to E. faecalis, nearly all strains of E. faecium are resistant to ampicillin, and the growing prevalence of vancomycin-resistant strains is an area of concern, although the main clinical problem seems strictly related to bloodstream infections (BSIs). Indeed, a recent meta-analysis showed a higher mortality for vancomycin-resistant E. faecium BSIs compared with vancomycin-sensitive E. faecium BSIs (RR = 1.46; 95% CI 1.17–1.82). For patients with VanA-type vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, linezolid or daptomycin are the preferred agents. Both linezolid and daptomycin have good in vitro activity against vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, although higher daily doses are needed. For VanB-type resistant strains, teicoplanin…

- **Antimicrobial resistance**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as the use of TMP/SMX in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection increases the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria.

- **Blood dyscrasias**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and other blood dyscrasias.

- **C. difficile infection**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as nearly all antibiotics, including TMP/SMX, are associated with an increased risk of C. difficile-associated diarrhea.

- **Crystalluria**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of crystalluria. Ensure adequate fluid intake and urinary output.

- **Decreased blood glucose**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with rare cases of hypoglycemia, especially in patients with renal dysfunction, liver disease, malnutrition, or receiving high doses of TMP/SMX.

- **Decreased platelet count**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of drug-induced thrombocytopenia.

- **Decreased serum sodium**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX can cause severe and symptomatic hyponatremia.

- **Hemolysis**: Use caution in patients with G6PD deficiency.

- **Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.

### Impact of Enterococcus faecalis endocarditis treatment on risk of relapse [^1133wAFB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

- **Comparison of the A-G combination with other regimens**: The cumulative incidence of relapse one year after endocarditis diagnosis was 46.2% (95% CI: 17.8%–85.8%) for patients treated with A, 13.4% (95% CI: 7.2%–24.2%) for patients treated with A-G, and 14.7% (95% CI: 8.6%–24.5%) with A-C therapy (Figure 2A). The lowest incidence was 4.3% (95% CI: 1.1%–16.0%) for patients sequentially treated with A-G/A-C.

Figure 2 illustrates the cumulative incidence of relapse and survival probability according to the treatment received.

- **A**: Cumulative incidence of relapse according to the treatment received in a Fine and Gray model (death considered as a competitive risk).

- **B**: Survival probability according to the treatment received in a Cox model. The comparison of different treatments considers the A-G combination as reference (A and B). Abbreviations: aHR, adjusted hazard ratio; aSHR, adjusted sub-distribution hazard ratio; CI, confidence interval.

When comparing the risk of relapse according to the treatment received, with A-G as a reference, no significant difference was observed in univariate and multivariate analysis. In a sensitivity analysis considering only patients who received complete treatment, treatment with A showed a significantly higher risk of relapse than A-G in multivariate analysis (aSHR 5.41, 95% CI: 1.19–24.6, P = 0.03, Supplementary Figure 2).

Patients treated with A-C had a significantly higher risk of death compared to A-G in univariate analysis but not in multivariate analysis (Figure 2B). Details on the outcomes of patients who received other treatments are available in the Supplementary Materials.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus vancomycin for severe infections caused by meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus: randomised controlled trial [^113ffv6a]. BMJ (2015). High credibility.

The primary efficacy outcome was clinical treatment failure at seven days. This was a composite of death, persistence of fever (less than 38°C for two consecutive days and no increase above 38° after resolution was required to rule out persistence), persistence of hypotension (less than 90 mm Hg systolic or need for vasopressor support), non-improving Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (for baseline SOFA of 3 or more, a decrease of at least 30% was required; and for baseline SOFA less than 3, a stable or decreased SOFA score was required to rule out failure), or persistent bacteraemia on day seven. Blood cultures were repeated on day two for all patients with bacteraemia and daily thereafter for patients with persistent fever, persistent bacteraemia, or other signs of infection. We also defined a primary safety outcome of all-cause mortality at 30 days.

Secondary outcomes included failure or modification of treatment, comprising treatment failure (as defined) or antibiotic treatment modification; bacteriological failure, defined as growth of MRSA on day seven cultures; persistence of bacteraemia at 48 hours; length of hospital admission; duration of fever, summing all days with at least one measurement of temperature 38°C or above until day 30; and development of resistance, defined as acquisition of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or vancomycin-resistant S. aureus or vancomycin-resistant Enterococci. Adverse events included renal failure defined using RIFLE criteria, rash, leucopoenia, any diarrhoea and Clostridium difficile associated diarrhoea, and other adverse events.

### Does trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis for HIV induce bacterial resistance to other antibiotic classes? Results of a systematic review [^116bLCRt]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

After placing weight on good-quality studies, and additional weight on studies that were specifically designed to determine whether TMP-SMX prophylaxis increases antibiotic resistance, the findings of this review offer suggestive evidence that TMP-SMX prophylaxis for opportunistic infections in HIV protects against the development of bacterial resistance to other classes of antibiotics. More carefully designed studies should be conducted to answer this question. It is important to ensure that future studies evaluate the importance of the duration of exposure to TMP-SMX on antimicrobial resistance.

Ideally, microbial resistance surveys should be included with TMP-SMX implementation in developing countries to alert providers to any changes in drug resistance patterns.

Of most importance, the fear of antibiotic resistance should not stop health care providers from giving TMP-SMX to individuals who need it.

### Does trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis for HIV induce bacterial resistance to other antibiotic classes? Results of a systematic review [^114thHFN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the available evidence regarding whether TMP-SMX prophylaxis causes an increase in bacterial resistance to other classes of antibiotics. From a public health perspective, an increase in resistance would reduce the usefulness of first-line antibiotics and result in fewer options for treating common bacterial infections in developing countries. From an individual perspective, patients receiving TMP-SMX prophylaxis may be at increased risk of treatment failure when they acquire a bacterial infection, although this has not been demonstrated in trials evaluating the effectiveness of TMP-SMX.

### Impact of Enterococcus faecalis endocarditis treatment on risk of relapse [^113aZRxG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Low credibility.

The strength of our study is its multicentric and exhaustive aspect: inclusion of most hospitals, including all referral centers in a large area, and the pragmatic approach for evaluation of treatment efficacy considering the antibiotic regimen really received by the patient. The limitations of this study are mainly inherent to its retrospective design, leading to missing data, a significant proportion of patients lost to follow-up, and the impossibility to fully control confounding factors in treatment effects despite multivariate analysis. The low number of relapses and of patients treated with amoxicillin alone leads to a lack of power in the analysis of treatment efficacy. The definition of acute kidney failure did not allow a reliable assessment of this complication. Finally, we did not evaluate the role of serum concentrations of antibiotics, which could be interesting to better understand the mechanisms of relapse.

### Does trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis for HIV induce bacterial resistance to other antibiotic classes? Results of a systematic review [^1117KD1j]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

A systematic review was conducted to explore whether cotrimoxazole prophylaxis for HIV increases bacterial resistance to other classes of antibiotics. There is suggestive evidence that cotrimoxazole protects against antibiotic resistance.

### A seven-day course of TMP-SMX may be as effective as a seven-day course of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of pyelonephritis [^112dV6U2]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommend either a 14-day course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or a 7-day course of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of pyelonephritis. Antibiotic courses of 7 days of TMP-SMX versus 7 days of ciprofloxacin for pyelonephritis have not been previously compared. We evaluated the odds of a subsequent, symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) for women with Escherichia coli pyelonephritis receiving a 7-day course of TMP-SMX versus a 7-day course of ciprofloxacin.

- **Methods**: Women aged 16 years and older with E. coli pyelonephritis presenting to five healthcare facilities in the greater Maryland area between 2010 and 2016, receiving either TMP-SMX or ciprofloxacin, were included. Patients were excluded if they met any of the following criteria: (a) pregnancy, (b) dialysis dependency, (c) E. coli not susceptible to the treatment prescribed, (d) polymicrobial urine culture, or (e) more than 48 hours of antibiotic therapy other than TMP-SMX or ciprofloxacin.

- **Results**: Of 272 women meeting eligibility criteria, 81 (30%) and 191 (70%) received 7 days of TMP-SMX and 7 days of ciprofloxacin, respectively. In an adjusted model, the likelihood of a recurrent UTI within 30 days for the TMP-SMX and ciprofloxacin groups was similar (adjusted odds ratio 2.30; 95% confidence interval 0.72–7.42).

- **Conclusions**: Our findings suggest that 7 days of TMP-SMX therapy may result in similar clinical outcomes compared to 7 days of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of pyelonephritis. Considering the frequency of pyelonephritis and risks of antibiotic resistance.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus placebo for uncomplicated skin abscess [^117E864F]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). High credibility.

U.S. emergency department visits for cutaneous abscess have increased with the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The role of antibiotics for patients with a drained abscess is unclear.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomized trial at five U.S. emergency departments to determine whether trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (at doses of 320 mg and 1600 mg, respectively, twice daily, for 7 days) would be superior to placebo in outpatients older than 12 years of age who had an uncomplicated abscess that was being treated with drainage. The primary outcome was clinical cure of the abscess, assessed 7 to 14 days after the end of the treatment period.

- **Results**: The median age of the participants was 35 years (range, 14 to 73); 45.3% of the participants had wound cultures that were positive for MRSA. In the modified intention-to-treat population, clinical cure of the abscess occurred in 507 of 630 participants (80.5%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group versus 454 of 617 participants (73.6%) in the placebo group (difference, 6.9 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, 2.1 to 11.7; P = 0.005). In the per-protocol population, clinical cure occurred in 487 of 524 participants (92.9%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group versus 457 of 533 participants (85.7%) in the placebo group (difference, 7.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 3.2 to 11.2; P < 0.001). Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was superior to placebo with respect to most secondary outcomes in the per-protocol population, resulting in lower rates of subsequent surgical drainage procedure.

### Antimicrobial resistance in uncomplicated urinary tract infections in 3 California EDs [^113BJ4DK]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Increased trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) resistance has led to changes in empiric treatment of female urinary tract infections (UTI) in the emergency department (ED), particularly increased use of fluoroquinolones (Acad Emerg Med 2009;16(6):500–507). Whether prescribing changes have affected susceptibility in uropathogens is unclear. Using narrow-spectrum agents and therapy tailored to local susceptibilities remain important goals.

- **Objective**: The primary goal of this study is to characterize the susceptibility patterns of uropathogens among ambulatory female ED patients with UTI. Its secondary goal is to identify demographic or clinical factors predictive of resistance to narrow-spectrum agents.

- **Methods**: This was a cross-sectional study of women with suspected UTI referred to a trial of computer kiosk-aided treatment of UTI in 3 Northern California EDs. Demographic and clinical data were gathered from the kiosk and chart, and features associated with resistance were identified by bivariate and multivariable regression analysis.

- **Results**: Two hundred eighty-three participants, aged 15 to 84 years, were diagnosed with UTI and cultured. One hundred thirty-five (48%) of cultures were positive, with full susceptibilities reported (81% Escherichia coli). Only 2 isolates (1.5%) were fluoroquinolone resistant. Resistance to TMP/SMX was 18%, to nitrofurantoin 5%, and to cefazolin 4%. Seventy-four percent were sensitive to all 3 narrow-spectrum agents. Resistance to narrow-spectrum agents did not vary significantly by diagnosis, age, recent UTI, or any clinical.

### Emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci [^111VAZbJ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Vancomycin and ampicillin resistance in clinical Enterococcus faecium strains has developed in the past decade. Failure to adhere to strict infection control to prevent the spread of these pathogens has been well established. New data implicate the use of specific classes of antimicrobial agents in the spread of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Extended-spectrum cephalosporins and drugs with potent activity against anaerobic bacteria may promote infection and colonization with VRE and may exert different effects on the initial establishment and persistence of high-density colonization. Control of VRE will require a better understanding of the mechanisms by which different classes of drugs promote gastrointestinal colonization.

### Stewardship approach for optimizing antimicrobial therapy through use of a rapid microarray assay on blood cultures positive for Enterococcus species [^114mYCTH]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2013). Low credibility.

Enterococci are a major cause of bloodstream infections in hospitalized patients and have limited antimicrobial treatment options due to their many resistance mechanisms. Molecular technologies have significantly shortened the time to enterococcal isolate identification compared with conventional methods. We evaluated the impact of rapid organism identification and resistance detection with the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture microarray assay on clinical and economic outcomes for patients with enterococcal bacteremia.

A single-center preintervention/postintervention quasi-experimental study compared inpatients with enterococcal bacteremia from 1 February 2012 to 9 September 2012 (preintervention period) and 10 September 2012 to 28 February 2013 (postintervention period). An infectious disease and/or critical care pharmacist was contacted with the microarray assay results, and effective antibiotics were recommended. The clinical and economic outcomes for 74 patients were assessed.

The mean time to appropriate antimicrobial therapy was 23.4 hours longer in the preintervention group than in the postintervention group (P = 0.0054). A nonsignificant decrease in the mean time to appropriate antimicrobial therapy was seen for patients infected with vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus isolates (P = 0.1145). For patients with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus bacteremia, the mean time to appropriate antimicrobial therapy was 31.1 hours longer in the preintervention group than in the postintervention group (P < 0.0001). In the postintervention group, the hospital length of stay was significantly reduced.

### Genome-wide identification of ampicillin resistance determinants in Enterococcus faecium [^116jZYSq]. PLoS Genetics (2012). Low credibility.

Enterococci rank third overall as causative agents of healthcare-associated infections. Up to the late 1980s, *Enterococcus faecalis* was responsible for practically all enterococcal infections. However, starting in the 1990s, nosocomial infections with *E. faecium* became more frequent. Currently, *E. faecium* causes approximately 40% of all enterococcal infections acquired during hospital stays. Clinical isolates of *E. faecium* have rapidly accumulated antibiotic resistance genes, including those for clinically important antibiotics such as ampicillin and vancomycin, which leads to treatment failure and increased mortality rates.

In the United States, nosocomial infections caused by ampicillin-resistant *E. faecium* (ARE) were first detected in the 1980s, and the resistance rates steadily increased to 80% of *E. faecium* isolates by the 1990s. Vancomycin-resistant *E. faecium* (VRE) also emerged in the late 1980s and increased rapidly during the 1990s. Currently, VRE is widespread among clinical *E. faecium* strains in North America, but less common in hospital-acquired infections in Europe. Ampicillin resistance has spread much further and is currently reported in over 80% of clinical *E. faecium* isolates worldwide (European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network).

In addition to ARE and VRE, the emergence of *E. faecium* strains resistant to new classes of antibiotics is challenging the few remaining therapeutic options. Thus, the development of new anti-enterococcal agents may become critical for the successful treatment of infections.

### Antecedent treatment with different antibiotic agents as a risk factor for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus [^114TwFBw]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The effect of third-generation cephalosporins on the risk for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) is likely due to their activity against nonenterococcal aerobic enteric flora, leading to a decrease in resistance colonization, allowing colonization with VRE. Similarly, suppression of gastrointestinal anaerobic flora is the presumed mechanism for the association between metronidazole and VRE. This activity and suppression do not explain the lack of effect of other agents with similar or even broader spectra of activity, such as clindamycin, β-lactamase–inhibitor combinations, and imipenem. Other researchers have suggested that the combination of enteric concentration of the antimicrobial agent and its spectrum of activity against competing microflora determines its likelihood to be a risk factor. In our study, the positive association between the duration of quinolone treatment and VRE had borderline statistical significance and a small increased risk per day of treatment. This observation, which requires further validation, may have important clinical implications for patients treated for long durations.

### Does trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis for HIV induce bacterial resistance to other antibiotic classes? Results of a systematic review [^111TcNMw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

The two studies (both type 1) specifically designed to answer the question of this review showed no change in pneumococcal resistance to penicillin. However, one of these studies reported resistance to clindamycin among HIV-exposed infants, as described above.

- **Type 2 studies**:
	- Four investigated MRSA infection, two investigated colonization with MRSA, and one reported on colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
	- Of the four MRSA infection studies, three (all considered to be good quality) reported a reduction in infection with MRSA, and one (not considered to be good quality) reported an increase in MRSA infection.
	- The type 2 colonization studies reported no change and reduced colonization for two MRSA studies, whereas there was a reported increase in colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococcus.

- **Heterogeneity analysis**:
	- Among the type 2 MRSA studies, there was significant heterogeneity among both the cross-sectional and case-control studies; therefore, no meta-analyses are presented.
	- For cohort studies, meta-analysis showed a protective effect of TMP-SMX prophylaxis on MRSA (relative risk, 0.29; 95% confidence interval, 0.12–0.7); the test for heterogeneity among cohort studies was not significant (P = 0.92).

In an analysis of results according to whether the study outcome was colonization or infection, no trends were observed in the data, possibly because of the small numbers in each category. Furthermore, no trends were noted when analyzing whether the study population comprised adults or children.

### A review of combination antimicrobial therapy for Enterococcus faecalis bloodstream infections and infective endocarditis [^117UXbiE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Enterococci, one of the most common causes of hospital-associated infections, are responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality. Enterococcus faecalis, the more common and virulent species, causes serious high-inoculum infections, namely infective endocarditis, which are associated with cardiac surgery and mortality rates that have remained unchanged for the last 30 years. The best cures for these infections are observed with combination antibiotic therapy; however, optimal treatment has not been fully elucidated. This review aims to highlight treatment options and their limitations, and provide direction for future investigative efforts to aid in the treatment of these severe infections.

While ampicillin plus ceftriaxone has emerged as a preferred treatment option, mortality rates continue to be high. From a safety standpoint, ceftriaxone, unlike other cephalosporins, promotes colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci due to high biliary concentrations. More research is needed to improve patient outcomes from this high-mortality disease.

### Enterococcus faecalis promotes innate immune suppression and polymicrobial catheter-associated urinary tract infection [^111r6Ko3]. Infection and Immunity (2017). Low credibility.

Enterococcus faecalis, a member of the human gastrointestinal microbiota, is an opportunistic pathogen associated with hospital-acquired wound, bloodstream, and urinary tract infections. E. faecalis can subvert or evade immune-mediated clearance, although the mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we examined E. faecalis-mediated subversion of macrophage activation. We observed that E. faecalis actively prevents NF-κB signaling in mouse RAW264.7 macrophages in the presence of Toll-like receptor agonists and during polymicrobial infection with Escherichia coli. E. faecalis and E. coli coinfection in a mouse model of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) resulted in a suppressed macrophage transcriptional response in the bladder compared to that with E. coli infection alone. Finally, we demonstrated that coinoculation of E. faecalis with a commensal strain of E. coli into catheterized bladders significantly augmented E. coli CAUTI. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that E. faecalis suppression of NF-κB-driven responses in macrophages promotes polymicrobial CAUTI pathogenesis, especially during coinfection with less virulent or commensal E. coli strains.

### Primary prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is linked to antibiotic resistance in the Veterans Health Administration [^1154Jg3o]. Hepatology (2023). Low credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a major cause of mortality. Although SBP primary prophylaxis (SBPPr) with fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is often used, resistance could reduce its benefit.

- **Aim**: Analyze peritoneal fluid resistance patterns in patients with a first SBP episode with or without SBPPr using the Veterans Health Administration corporate data warehouse and evaluate national antibiograms.

Corporate data warehouse data were extracted using validated International Classification of Disease-9/10 codes, culture, resistance data, and outcomes of 7,553 patients who developed their first inpatient SBP between 2009 and 2019. Comparisons were made between those with and without SBPPr. Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) sensitivity to ciprofloxacin and TMP-SMX was calculated using 2021 Veterans Health Administration antibiogram data from all states.

The most common isolates were E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus species. Veterans taking ciprofloxacin SBPPr had higher fluoroquinolone resistance (34% vs. 14% no SBPPr, p < 0.0001); those taking TMP-SMX had higher TMP-SMX resistance (40% vs. 14%, p < 0.0001). SBPPr patients showed higher culture positivity, greater length of stay, higher second SBP incidents, and higher probability of liver transplant rates versus no SBPPr.

Multivariable models indicated SBPPr as the only variable associated with gram-negative resistance, and SBPPr was associated with a trend toward a longer length of stay. E. coli ciprofloxacin sensitivity rates were between 50% and 87%, and 43% to 92% for TMP-SMX.

### Bactrim [^1143uW9h]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Development of drug resistant bacteria**: Prescribing BACTRIM (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

- **Folate deficiency**: Avoid use of BACTRIM in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function, those with possible folate deficiency (e.g. the elderly, chronic alcoholics, patients receiving anticonvulsant therapy, patients with malabsorption syndrome, and patients in malnutrition states), and in those with severe allergies or bronchial asthma. Hematological changes indicative of folic acid deficiency may occur in elderly patients or in patients with preexisting folic acid deficiency or kidney failure. These effects are reversible by folinic acid therapy (see PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use).

- **Hemolysis**: In glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient individuals, hemolysis may occur. This reaction is frequently dose-related.

- **Hypoglycemia**: Cases of hypoglycemia in non-diabetic patients treated with BACTRIM are seen rarely, usually occurring following a few days of therapy. Patients with renal dysfunction, liver disease, malnutrition, or those receiving high doses of BACTRIM are particularly at risk.

- **Impaired phenylalanine metabolism**: The trimethoprim component of BACTRIM has been noted to impair phenylalanine metabolism, but this is of no significance in phenylketonuric patients on appropriate dietary restriction.

- **Porphyria and hypothyroidism**: Like other drugs contai
