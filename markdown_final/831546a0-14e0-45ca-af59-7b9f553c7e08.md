## Question

Can albuterol be used to treat achalasia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether albuterol can be used to treat achalasia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what albuterol is actually approved and used for. Then, I should verify evidence-based treatments for achalasia from high-quality guidelines. Next, I will examine whether any authoritative source links beta-2 agonists to esophageal motility benefit. After that, I need to check mechanistic plausibility at the level of the lower esophageal sphincter. Finally, I will synthesize whether there is any clinical role for albuterol in achalasia management and offer the evidence-based alternatives [^113StQ7S] [^1165ALjE] [^116oGPr2].

> Let me first confirm albuterol's labeled indication and usual clinical use, because if I misclassify the drug's domain, I could draw a faulty conclusion. Albuterol is a selective beta-2 adrenergic agonist indicated for relief of bronchospasm in reversible obstructive airway disease; the FDA labeling outlines dosing, interactions, and contraindications pertinent to pulmonary use, with no esophageal or gastrointestinal indications listed or implied [^113StQ7S] [^114e1U9x] [^111pe1ig].

> Next, I should review what achalasia is pathophysiologically and how we diagnose it, to ensure the therapeutic target is clear. Achalasia is a primary esophageal motor disorder marked by degeneration of the myenteric plexus with impaired relaxation of the esophagogastric junction and loss of organized peristalsis; diagnosis relies on high-resolution manometry with elevated integrated relaxation pressure and absent peristalsis, often after supportive endoscopy or esophagram findings [^115xwewz] [^117R9QWb] [^111mdiRM].

> I will now examine evidence-based treatments for achalasia, since any consideration of a repurposed agent needs to be positioned against established standards. Definitive therapies that reduce outflow resistance at the lower esophageal sphincter include peroral endoscopic myotomy, laparoscopic Heller myotomy, and pneumatic dilation, with guideline recommendations to select among them based on subtype, local expertise, and patient preference; contemporary comparative trials and network meta-analyses support POEM and LHM as highly effective options relative to pneumatic dilation in many settings [^116oGPr2] [^113iU4uf] [^111smjq2] [^114vh6YT].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about medications yet; I should review pharmacologic options historically used when definitive therapy is not feasible. Initially, I would say calcium channel blockers and long-acting nitrates have been recommended as palliative options for patients unable or unwilling to undergo procedural therapy, per ACG 2013 guidance, and botulinum toxin injection is reserved for poor procedural candidates [^1165ALjE] [^11256H16]. But wait, I should double-check more recent guidance; ISDE 2018 advises against using nitrates, calcium channel blockers, or phosphodiesterase inhibitors for symptomatic relief, reflecting limited and inconsistent efficacy and tolerability, which helps reconcile the shift toward procedural therapies as the mainstay while leaving medications as marginal at best in select non-procedural candidates [^112koofC] [^114YmRiS] [^111TKFMX].

> Now, I need to check whether any authoritative source links albuterol to achalasia management or LES modulation, because anecdotal reasoning here would be risky. A careful look across FDA albuterol labeling and major achalasia guidelines from ASGE, ACG, and ISDE shows no mention of albuterol for esophageal motility disorders, no recommendation to use beta-2 agonists for LES dysfunction, and no trial data supporting such use, which strongly suggests the absence of an evidence base for this application [^113StQ7S] [^116oGPr2] [^1165ALjE].

> Let me consider mechanistic plausibility, and I should verify whether beta-2 agonism is expected to reduce pathological LES outflow resistance in achalasia. Achalasia's problem is impaired LES relaxation due to inhibitory neuronal loss and absent peristalsis, and when medications are used, they target smooth muscle relaxation via nitric oxide or calcium channel blockade, or cholinergic inhibition with botulinum toxin to lower LES pressure transiently; there is no documented role for beta-2 agonists in reliably reducing LES pressure or restoring peristalsis in achalasia, and contemporary reviews of medical therapy do not include beta-agonists among options for symptom control [^116dQQve] [^11256H16] [^115xwewz].

> I should confirm safety and contraindication context to avoid implying harm where there is merely no indication. The albuterol label emphasizes pulmonary indications with cautions about concomitant sympathomimetics, MAOIs, tricyclics, beta-blockers, and diuretics; it does not list achalasia-related esophageal disease as a contraindication, but absence of a contraindication does not equal evidence of benefit for achalasia, and using albuterol off-label for this purpose would not be supported by pharmacologic rationale or guidelines [^112QYRBD] [^115v5V7k] [^111pe1ig].

> Synthesis time; let me reconsider everything to ensure internal consistency. The totality of evidence indicates albuterol is a bronchodilator for obstructive airway disease and is absent from achalasia treatment frameworks, whereas achalasia care relies on definitive LES-disrupting procedures, with limited, often discouraged use of oral smooth muscle relaxants as palliative measures in non-procedural candidates; there is no regulatory, guideline, or mechanistic support for albuterol in achalasia [^113StQ7S] [^116oGPr2] [^112koofC].

> Bottom line: No, albuterol should not be used to treat achalasia; it has no established role, approval, or supporting evidence in this condition, and guideline-concordant management should prioritize POEM, laparoscopic Heller myotomy, or pneumatic dilation, with botulinum toxin or, in older guidelines, limited trials of nitrates or calcium channel blockers considered only when definitive therapies are not feasible [^116oGPr2] [^113iU4uf] [^113StQ7S].

---

No, albuterol is not recommended for achalasia because it does not address the core problem of **impaired LES relaxation and absent peristalsis** [^115xwewz]. It is not included in any guideline for achalasia management, and there is **no evidence supporting its use** for this indication [^116oGPr2] [^113StQ7S]. Definitive therapies such as POEM, Heller myotomy, or pneumatic dilation are preferred, with botulinum toxin or oral smooth muscle relaxants reserved for patients unfit for invasive procedures [^111smjq2] [^114MyN9t] [^1165ALjE].

---

## Pharmacological rationale and mechanism of action

Albuterol is a selective beta-2 adrenergic agonist that relaxes bronchial smooth muscle via cAMP-mediated pathways [^113StQ7S]. The LES is primarily regulated by nitrergic and cholinergic neurons, and beta-2 agonists have minimal effect on LES tone or esophageal peristalsis. Therefore, albuterol **does not address the core pathophysiology** of achalasia [^116ewSDb].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

There is **no clinical evidence or guideline support** for albuterol in achalasia [^111TKFMX]. Major guidelines (ASGE, ACG, ISDE) do not mention albuterol for achalasia management [^116oGPr2] [^1165ALjE] [^114vh6YT]. Pharmacologic therapy is limited to nitrates or calcium channel blockers for patients unfit for definitive therapy [^1165ALjE] [^111TKFMX].

---

## Comparative effectiveness with standard treatments

Albuterol has **no demonstrated efficacy** in achalasia and is not recommended. In contrast, standard therapies have robust evidence [^111smjq2] [^1174FuLs]:

- **POEM**: Effective across subtypes, especially type III [^114YmRiS].
- **Laparoscopic Heller myotomy**: Effective for types I and II [^111cYtAq].
- **Pneumatic dilation**: Effective for types I and II [^1148VRvK].
- **Botulinum toxin**: For patients unfit for definitive therapy [^114MyN9t] [^11256H16].

---

## Safety considerations and contraindications

Albuterol **can cause tremor, tachycardia, palpitations, and hypokalemia**, and is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to albuterol or its components [^112TA2E7] [^111pe1ig]. These risks are unjustified given the lack of benefit in achalasia.

---

## Current clinical recommendations

Albuterol is **not recommended** for achalasia [^111TKFMX]. Definitive therapies (POEM, Heller myotomy, pneumatic dilation) are preferred [^116oGPr2] [^111cYtAq], with botulinum toxin or oral smooth muscle relaxants reserved for patients unfit for invasive procedures [^1165ALjE] [^114MyN9t]. These recommendations reflect that albuterol does not address the core pathophysiology, lacks evidence of benefit, and is not included in any guideline, while definitive therapies remain the standard of care [^115xwewz] [^114vh6YT].

### An update on current management strategies for achalasia and future perspectives [^111ZpXb9]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The last decade has seen growing insight into the pathophysiology of achalasia, and treatments decreasing the resting pressure in the lower esophageal sphincter by endoscopic methods, such as botulinum toxin injection, pneumatic dilation, and peroral endoscopic myotomy, or by surgical means like Heller myotomy. Manometry is considered the gold standard to confirm the diagnosis of achalasia. Pneumatic dilation and laparoscopic Heller myotomy have similar effectiveness and are both more successful in patients with type II achalasia.

Laparoscopic myotomy, when combined with partial fundoplication, is an effective surgical technique and has been considered the operative procedure of choice until recently. Peroral endoscopic myotomy is an emerging therapy with promising results since it offers a minimally invasive and efficacious option, especially in type III achalasia. However, it remains to be determined if peroral endoscopic myotomy offers long-term efficacy.

The management of oesophageal motility disorders has seen significant advancements with the advent of high-resolution manometry (HRM). Achalasia syndromes, in particular, benefit from precise diagnostic techniques afforded by HRM. These techniques enhance the ability to classify and manage the various subtypes of achalasia, allowing for tailored therapeutic approaches.

- **Diagnostic advancements**: HRM offers detailed pressure topography plots that facilitate accurate diagnosis of achalasia subtypes, including type I (classic), type II (with pan-oesophageal pressurization), and type III (spastic). These distinctions are crucial, as they guide personalized treatment strategies.

- **Therapeutic strategies**: Recent approaches focus on less invasive interventions such as pneumatic dilation and peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM). The choice of treatment is often influenced by HRM findings, ensuring optimal outcomes for patients.

The review underscores the transformative role of HRM in diagnosing and managing oesophageal motility disorders, emphasizing its impact on improving patient care.

In conclusion, the choice of treatment for achalasia is multifactorial, and a "one size fits all" approach is not appropriate. All treatments and all patients have various aspects that need to be examined thoroughly before opting for one treatment rather than another. A center specializing in achalasia should have all possible techniques in its armamentarium so that it can choose the most appropriate treatment for a given patient.

### Impact of high-resolution manometry on achalasia diagnosis and treatment [^111uSAZF]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

These studies have methodological differences according to the type of esophageal manometry, treatment modalities, definition of response, and time of follow-up. Nevertheless, consistent across all studies was the observation that patients with type II achalasia have the best response, while those with type III achalasia have the worst response to treatment. It seems that type II has the best results for pneumatic dilation (PD), and surgery seems to benefit more patients with type I achalasia. Although PD and surgery are not very effective in patients with type III achalasia, medical therapy such as Botox might be an alternative for these patients.

These results suggest that achalasia subtypes represent unique clinical phenotypes and may offer criteria to plan the optimal treatment for patients with achalasia, although more prospective data are needed to confirm these initial results.

### Expert consensus document: Advances in the management of oesophageal motility disorders in the era of high-resolution manometry: A focus on achalasia syndromes [^113iVr4V]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). High credibility.

High-resolution manometry (HRM) and new analysis algorithms, summarized in the Chicago Classification, have led to a restructured classification of oesophageal motility disorders. This advance has resulted in increased detection of clinically relevant disorders, particularly achalasia. It has become apparent that the cardinal feature of achalasia — impaired lower oesophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation — can occur in several disease phenotypes: without peristalsis (type I), with pan-oesophageal pressurization (type II), with premature (spastic) distal oesophageal contractions (type III), or with preserved peristalsis (outlet obstruction). Furthermore, no manometric pattern is perfectly sensitive or specific for achalasia caused by a myenteric plexopathy, and there is no biomarker for this pathology. Consequently, physiological testing reveals other syndromes not meeting achalasia criteria that also benefit from therapies formerly reserved for achalasia.

These findings have become particularly relevant with the development of a minimally invasive technique for performing a long oesophageal myotomy, the per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM). Optimal management involves rendering treatment in a phenotype-specific manner; that is, POEM calibrated to patient-specific physiology for spastic achalasia and the spastic disorders and more conservative strategies such as pneumatic dilation for disorders limited to the LES.

This consensus statement examines the effect of HRM on our understanding of oesophageal motility disorders, with a focus on the diagnosis, epidemiology, and management of achalasia syndromes.

### Efficacy and safety of pneumatic dilation in achalasia: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Uz3ML]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

- **Results**: The literature search, screening, and selection process began with 1777 records, broken down as follows: PubMed yielded 884, Embase 790, and Cochrane 103. After the removal of 557 duplicates, 1220 unique studies remained. Subsequent title and abstract screenings led to the exclusion of 1163 studies. During full-text screening, an additional 41 articles were excluded. The remaining 16 articles underwent critical appraisal. Four of these studies were excluded during this appraisal, and two other studies were excluded due to reported success rates being outliers, causing significant heterogeneity. Consequently, 10 articles were deemed eligible and included in the systematic review.

- **Critical appraisal and heterogeneity assessment**: The four studies excluded during critical appraisal are detailed in Table 1. Two studies were excluded because of inconsistent treatment protocols. Specifically, Ding [12] and Yamashita et al. [13] had dilated some patients initially with a 30 mm balloon and others with a 35 mm balloon without differentiating results. Additionally, Ding et al. failed to describe the final success rate after follow-up or the outcome measurement. A study by Ahmed et al. [14] was excluded for lack of a defined clinical remission. The fourth excluded study by Muehldorfer et al. [15] involved a heterogeneous group of treated and untreated patients without providing information on previous treatments or distinguishing treatment results among these groups.

The two excluded outlier studies during heterogeneity assessment were Khalaf et al. [data truncated].

### Current diagnosis and management of achalasia [^113E1qay]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Achalasia is the best-characterized primary esophageal motility disorder of the esophagus. It typically presents with absent peristalsis of the esophageal body and a failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax upon swallowing, as observed on manometry. This condition is associated with progressively severe dysphagia, regurgitation, aspiration, chest pain, and weight loss.

The diagnosis is suggested by barium swallow and endoscopy and confirmed by manometry. As there is no curative treatment for achalasia, treatment focuses on disrupting the lower esophageal sphincter to improve bolus passage. Treatment modalities for this purpose include pneumatic dilation, laparoscopic Heller myotomy, and more recently, peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM).

In this review, we discuss the diagnosis, management, and treatment options for achalasia.

### Diagnosis and management of esophageal achalasia [^1112qQRF]. BMJ (2016). Low credibility.

Achalasia is a rare esophageal motility disorder that is usually idiopathic in origin. It is characterized by dysphagia, and patients often experience chest pain, regurgitation, weight loss, and an abnormal barium radiograph showing esophageal dilation with narrowing at the gastroesophageal junction. Abnormal or absent esophageal peristalsis and impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) are typically observed on esophageal manometry.

The advent of high-resolution manometry (HRM) has allowed more precise diagnosis of achalasia, subtype designation, and differentiation from other esophageal motor disorders, initially detailed in a seminal publication in 2008 followed by further refinements termed the Chicago classification.

- **Potential treatments**: include medication, endoscopic botulinum toxin injection, balloon dilation, traditional surgery (usually laparoscopic Heller myotomy; LHM), and a novel, less invasive, natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) approach to Heller myotomy termed peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM). The first human POEM was performed in 2008, with the first publication appearing in 2010, and evidence is now rapidly accumulating indicating that POEM is comparable to traditional surgery in terms of clinical success and radiologic and manometric post-therapy outcomes.

This review discusses the diagnosis and management of achalasia with particular emphasis on the recent developments of HRM and POEM, which arguably represent the most significant advances in the field since the advent of laparoscopic Heller myotomy in the 1990s.

### Comparative efficacy of first-line therapeutic interventions for achalasia: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111smjq2]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). High credibility.

An important strength of this network meta-analysis is the inclusion of RCTs alone and the incorporation of new trials. Notably, it includes two landmark head-to-head RCTs comparing POEM to LHM and PD. Previous meta-analyses predated these RCTs, included both observational and randomized studies, and did not objectively appraise the overall quality of evidence using standardized GRADE methodology.

Although the finding of an increased rate of post-treatment GERD after POEM was expected, it is important to discuss the clinical implications. Ten to 20-year long-term follow-up after Heller myotomy reports a high incidence of GERD and erosive complications, including strictures, Barrett's esophagus, and esophageal adenocarcinoma, which in turn contribute to the failure rate of myotomy at 10 years. As such, Heller myotomy is often performed with an anti-reflux procedure. In POEM, the lack of a combined anti-reflux procedure likely augments gastroesophageal reflux physiology following POEM. However, the pooled estimate of severe erosive reflux disease following POEM in the short term is low. A previous meta-analysis found that approximately 30 patients should be treated with LHM over POEM to prevent one case of post-procedure severe esophagitis. Further, initial experiences of endoscopic transoral incisionless fundoplication following POEM have been shown to reduce risks of esophagitis and esophageal acid exposure. Nonetheless, long-term follow-up of the consequences of GERD post-POEM needs to be studied.

### ASGE guideline on the management of achalasia [^115xwewz]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2020). High credibility.

Achalasia is a primary esophageal motor disorder of unknown etiology characterized by degeneration of the myenteric plexus, which results in impaired relaxation of the esophagogastric junction (EGJ), along with the loss of organized peristalsis in the esophageal body. The criterion standard for diagnosing achalasia is high-resolution esophageal manometry, which shows incomplete relaxation of the EGJ coupled with the absence of organized peristalsis. Three achalasia subtypes have been defined based on high-resolution manometry findings in the esophageal body.

Treatment of patients with achalasia has evolved in recent years with the introduction of peroral endoscopic myotomy. Other treatment options include botulinum toxin injection, pneumatic dilation, and Heller myotomy. This American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Standards of Practice Guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of achalasia, based on an updated assessment of the individual and comparative effectiveness, adverse effects, and cost of the four aforementioned achalasia therapies.

### Modern management of achalasia [^1133dRwJ]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Achalasia is a chronic esophageal motility disorder characterized by incomplete lower esophageal sphincter relaxation and aperistalsis, leading to delayed esophageal emptying. Management focuses on symptom palliation and quality of life improvement. Factors such as demographics, disease severity, and comorbidities influence management options.

- **Recent findings**: With low rates of complications, surgical myotomy has become the preferred primary treatment, especially in young males. However, recent studies reporting favorable long-term outcomes for pneumatic dilation suggest it as a reasonable first-line therapy option.

- **Summary**: Pneumatic dilation and surgical myotomy are the most effective therapeutic options for achalasia. Depending on local expertise, either can serve as first-line therapy. Pharmacologic agents and botulinum toxin have limited roles, applicable only to certain patient populations.

### Impact of high-resolution manometry on achalasia diagnosis and treatment [^1146t8HP]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

The classification of achalasia has evolved with the introduction of high-resolution esophageal pressure topography (HREPT). Different achalasia subtypes have been described, all of which are associated with abnormal esophagogastric junction (EGJ) relaxation and are categorized based on the pattern of esophageal body contraction and pressurization. Thus, by HREPT, achalasia can be subtyped into classic achalasia (with no esophageal pressurization by swallowing), achalasia with esophageal pressurization (characterized by compression of the water bolus between the upper and lower esophageal sphincter [LES]), and spastic achalasia (characterized by nonpropulsive, high-amplitude contractions in the esophageal body). The impact of this new classification system on the clinical management of achalasia will be discussed further.

- **Differential diagnosis of abnormal LES relaxation**: HREPT studies demonstrated a population of patients with impaired LES relaxation and remaining peristaltic movement of the tubular esophagus that fails to meet diagnostic criteria of achalasia, similar to those with 'atypical disorders of LES relaxation' in conventional manometry (CM). This disorder was called functional obstruction in the first Chicago classification schemes. Subsequently, it was demonstrated that these patients had elevated intrabolus pressure, similar to patients with a known mechanical obstruction; therefore, it is now categorized as EGJ outflow obstruction.

### Surgical and endoscopic interventions in the management of idiopathic achalasia [^113yAvBV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

- **Methods**:

- **Criteria for considering studies for this review**:
	- **Types of studies**:
		We will include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compare any combination of POEM, LHM, and/or pneumatic dilation. Subtypes of these interventions, such as pneumatic dilation with or without botulinum toxin injection, will also be considered where data permit. We will include studies published as full manuscripts and conference abstracts, as well as unpublished data and impose no restrictions on publication date or language. We will exclude cross‐over trials and cluster‐randomized controlled trials, as our unit of analysis will be individuals and not groups (e.g. clinics, hospitals). Observational studies and quasi‐randomized trials will be excluded.

	- **Types of participants**:
		We will include studies in participants who are adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with idiopathic achalasia (i.e. not secondary to Chagas disease). Diagnosis must be based on clinical presentation and high‐resolution manometry (HRM). Although barium esophagram and endoscopy may be used, clinical guidelines strongly recommend the use of HRM to diagnose achalasia. However, if there is traditional manometry with at least 24 months of data, we will consider that equivalent to HRM for the purposes of diagnosis.

	- **Types of interventions**:
		We will include RCTs that compare any combination of the following interventions: POEM, including procedural variations.

### Treatment of achalasia in the era of high-resolution manometry [^11156gwj]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Type I (classic achalasia) is characterized by no significant pressurization within the esophageal body and impaired LES relaxation. Type II (achalasia with compression or compartmentalization in the distal esophagus > 30 mm Hg) involves rapid panesophageal pressurization with water swallows. Type III (spastic achalasia) is defined by rapidly propagated pressurization attributable to an abnormal lumen obliterating contraction.

Figure 1 illustrates achalasia subtypes according to the Chicago classification:

- **Type I (classic achalasia)**: Patients exhibit absence of peristalsis, no pressurization within the esophageal body, and high integrated relaxation pressure (IRP).
- **Type II (achalasia with compression)**: Patients show absence of peristalsis and contractile activity, panesophageal pressurization > 30 mmHg, and high IRP.
- **Type III (spastic achalasia)**: Characterized by absence of peristalsis, two or more spastic contractions with or without periods of compartmentalized pressurization, and high IRP.

Additionally, high-resolution manometry (HRM) introduces a new parameter for quantifying LES relaxation: the integrated relaxation pressure. This measures the mean post-swallow LES pressure over a 4-second period during which the LES pressure is lowest, skipping periods of crural contractions if necessary. The upper normal limit for the integrated relaxation pressure is 10 mmHg for type I achalasia, 15 mmHg for type II, and 17 mmHg for type III, which best differentiates the impaired relaxation pressures.

### Management strategies for achalasia [^112hDUqm]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2014). Low credibility.

Treatment options for achalasia include oral pharmacologic therapy, endoscopic injection of botulinum toxin, pneumatic dilation, and myotomy (conventionally by laparoscopy, but more recently by an endoscopic approach). Oral pharmacologic agents have fallen out of use because of insufficient efficacy and frequent side effects. Endoscopic injection of botulinum toxin is safe and has good short-term effectiveness, but as the effect invariably wears off following a few months, this treatment is reserved for patients who are not candidates for more definitive treatments.

Pneumatic dilation and surgical myotomy are currently considered the most effective treatments, with similar effectiveness in randomized controlled trials with follow-up of up to two years. The risk/benefit ratio and choice of therapy depend on patient characteristics (age, comorbidities, disease stage, prior treatments), patient preference, and locally available expertise. Treatment of patients who fail or relapse after initial therapy is challenging, and the success rate of pneumatic dilation or myotomy in this group is lower compared to previously untreated patients.

The recently developed peroral endoscopic approach to myotomy has achieved excellent results in early uncontrolled studies, but high-quality randomized trials are needed to ensure widespread adoption is reasonable. Finally, retrospective data suggest that achalasia subtypes as defined by high-resolution esophageal pressure topography may guide treatment choice, but confirmation in prospective outcome studies is awaited.

### Treatment of achalasia in the era of high-resolution manometry [^114XLLga]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Esophageal achalasia is a primary motility disorder characterized by impaired lower esophageal sphincter relaxation and absence of esophageal peristalsis, leading to impaired bolus transit. This condition manifests with symptoms such as dysphagia, regurgitation, retrosternal pain, and weight loss. The standard diagnostic tool is esophageal manometry, which demonstrates incomplete relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter and impaired esophageal peristalsis.

Recently, a new advanced technique, high-resolution manometry (HRM) with the addition of pressure topography plotting, has been developed. This technique uses multiple sensors to capture manometric data as a spatial continuum, allowing for a detailed pressure recording of esophageal motility. Currently the gold standard for the diagnosis of achalasia, HRM has led to a subclassification of three manometric types that seem to have different responsiveness to treatment.

Because its pathogenesis is as yet unknown, achalasia treatment options are not curative. Type II achalasia patients respond better to treatment compared to those with types I and III. Low-risk patients with type I or II achalasia experience good outcomes with both graded pneumatic dilations and laparoscopic Heller myotomy. Conversely, type III achalasia patients respond better to laparoscopic Heller myotomy, although they respond less in comparison to types I and II. Peroral endoscopic myotomy is a promising new technique, but long-term follow-up studies for its safety and efficacy must be performed.

### High-resolution manometry in treated achalasia: Scoping review and novel nomenclature [^11246ZnM]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

The Chicago Classification (CC) for high-resolution manometry (HRM) is the standard for the diagnostic criteria of primary motility disorders, with achalasia being the most relevant. Notably, CC does not include recommendations on HRM in treated achalasia, whether after surgery or endoscopic interventions.

- **Material and methods**: After a systematic review of the literature on three major databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science) from inception to December 2024, a group of 12 esophageal motility experts provided recommendations for HRM interpretation in treated achalasia. They also proposed novel nomenclature and a management flow-chart to address gaps in the diagnostic CC hierarchy.

- **Results**: The search yielded 40 articles on HRM in treated achalasia. Unsuccessful achalasia treatment results in high-integrated relaxation pressure (IRP) and obstructive features, especially on provocative maneuvers. We propose the term "treated achalasia with outflow obstruction" (TAOO) instead of achalasia. Conversely, the term "adequately treated achalasia" (ATA) is suggested in the absence of obstructive features, instead of terms like absent contractility or ineffective motility, which could be misleading. We propose an IRP cut-off of the upper limit of normal according to the HRM system used, similar to that recommended for the naïve sphincter by CC to describe incomplete sphincter relaxation despite treatment. Intrabolus pressurization and abnormal IRP on Rapid Drink Challenge (RDC) are additional obstructive features. Assessment of body contractility, either ineffective (< 450 mmHg.cm.s) or spastic (< 4.5 sec), is relevant to discern treated achalasia from untreated cases.

### Albuterol [^112QYRBD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: The concomitant use of albuterol and other oral sympathomimetic agents is not recommended, as such combined use may lead to deleterious cardiovascular effects. This recommendation does not preclude the judicious use of an aerosol bronchodilator of the adrenergic stimulant type in patients receiving albuterol. Such concomitant use, however, should be individualized and not given on a routine basis. If regular coadministration is required, then alternative therapy should be considered.

- **Monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants**: Albuterol should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, or within two weeks of discontinuation of such agents, because the action of albuterol on the vascular system may be potentiated.

- **Beta-blockers**: Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents not only block the pulmonary effect of beta-agonists, such as albuterol, but may produce severe bronchospasm in asthmatic patients. Therefore, patients with asthma should not normally be treated with beta-blockers. However, under certain circumstances, such as prophylaxis after myocardial infarction, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents in patients with asthma. In this setting, cardioselective beta-blockers could be considered, although they should be administered with caution.

- **Diuretics**: The ECG changes and/or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of non-potassium-sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acute.

### Whose patient is it? The path to multidisciplinary management of achalasia [^116FQszB]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2018). Low credibility.

In the past decade, the introduction of high-resolution manometry and the classification of achalasia into subtypes has made it possible to accurately diagnose the disease and predict the response to treatment for its various subtypes. However, even at the time of writing, in an era of exponential medical progress and increased insight into disease mechanisms, the treatment of patients with achalasia remains rather simplistic and is mostly confined to mechanical disruption of the lower esophageal sphincter by different means.

There is partial consensus on what constitutes the best available treatments for patients with achalasia. Herein, we provide a comprehensive outlook on a general approach to patients with suspected achalasia by:

- **Defining the modern evaluation process**: Understanding the current methods used to assess achalasia.
- **Describing the diagnostic value**: Evaluating high-resolution manometry and the Chicago Classification in predicting treatment outcomes.
- **Discussing the available treatment options**: Considering patient conditions, alternatives available to both the surgeon and the gastroenterologist, and the burden to the health care system.

It is our hope that such a discussion will contribute to the value-based management of achalasia by promoting a leaner clinical flow of patients at all points of care.

### New diagnostic approach to diagnosis of achalasia after recent Chicago classification [^117GFivp]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

We read with great interest the recently published article by Müller. The author aimed to explain the importance of high-resolution manometry (HRM) on achalasia diagnosis and management. She explained conventional manometry (CM) and HRM criteria for diagnosis of achalasia. We thank Müller for this valuable study, but we think that there are some controversies that need to be clarified.

- **Clarification on pressure sensor placement**: The author mentioned that additional effort is needed for esophageal body motility evaluation by positioning pressure sensors in the body, instead of evaluating when positioning on the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Conventional manometry contains 4–8 pressure sensors. To assess the LES and the esophageal body in one investigation, it is better to use a catheter with 4 or more transducers in the esophagus. For example, with 8-sensor conventional manometry, when the lower sensors (5th-8th) are on the LES high-pressure zone, the other 4 sensors (1st-4th) are on the esophageal body 5, 10, 15, and 20 cm above the LES. We believe that these sensors are adequate to evaluate esophageal motility, especially in the lower two-thirds of the esophageal body.

- **Discussion on median vs. mean IRP**: The author also mentioned that for diagnosis of achalasia with HRM, the mean integrated relaxation pressure (IRP) must be elevated beyond the upper limit of normal (> 15 mmHg). However, the International HRM Working Group has recently indicated that it is better to use median IRP rather than mean IRP for the diagnosis of achalasia.

The author clearly defined achalasia subgroups and esophagogastric junction (EGJ) outflow obstruction, but the importance of EGJ was not fully elaborated upon.

### Albuterol [^112TA2E7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

In clinical trials, the most frequent adverse reactions to albuterol tablets were:

- **Adverse reactions**: Rare cases of urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, and oropharyngeal edema have been reported after the use of albuterol. In addition, albuterol, like other sympathomimetic agents, can cause adverse reactions such as hypertension, angina, vomiting, vertigo, central nervous system stimulation, unusual taste, and drying or irritation of the oropharynx.

- **Nature of reactions**: The reactions are generally transient in nature, and it is usually not necessary to discontinue treatment with albuterol tablets. In selected cases, however, dosage may be reduced temporarily; after the reaction has subsided, dosage should be increased in small increments to the optimal dosage.

### ACG clinical guideline: Diagnosis and management of achalasia [^116ewSDb]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). High credibility.

Achalasia is a primary motor disorder of the esophagus characterized by insufficient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation and loss of esophageal peristalsis. This condition results in patients' complaints of dysphagia to solids and liquids, regurgitation, and occasional chest pain with or without weight loss. Endoscopic findings of retained saliva with a puckered gastroesophageal junction or a barium swallow showing a dilated esophagus with bird's beaking in a symptomatic patient should prompt appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

In this ACG guideline, the authors present an evidence-based approach for patients with achalasia, based on a comprehensive review of the pertinent evidence and examination of relevant published data.

### ASGE guideline on the management of achalasia [^113jv1Vu]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2020). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for achalasia, more specifically with respect to POEM, the ASGE 2020 guidelines recommend considering the performance of either POEM or laparoscopic Heller myotomy. This decision should be based on shared decision-making between the patient and provider for the management of patients with achalasia types I and II.

### Comparative efficacy of first-line therapeutic interventions for achalasia: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116Hezgb]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). Low credibility.

Several interventions with variable efficacy are available as first-line therapy for patients with achalasia. We assessed the comparative efficacy of different strategies for management of achalasia through a network meta-analysis combining direct and indirect treatment comparisons.

- **Methods**: We identified six randomized controlled trials in adults with achalasia that compared the efficacy of pneumatic dilation (PD; n = 260), laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM; n = 309), and peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM; n = 176). The primary efficacy outcome was 1-year treatment success (patient-reported improvement in symptoms based on validated scores); secondary efficacy outcomes were 2-year treatment success and physiologic improvement. Safety outcomes were the risk of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), severe erosive esophagitis, and procedure-related serious adverse events. We performed pairwise and network meta-analyses for all treatments and used GRADE criteria to appraise the quality of evidence.

- **Results**: Low-quality evidence, based primarily on direct evidence, supports the use of POEM (RR [risk ratio], 1.29; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 0.99–1.69) and LHM (RR, 1.18 [0.96–1.44]) over PD for treatment success at 1 year; no significant difference was observed between LHM and POEM (RR, 1.09 [0.86–1.39]). The incidence of severe esophagitis after POEM, LHM, and PD was 5.3%, 3.7%, and 1.5%, respectively. Procedure-related serious adverse event rates after POEM, LHM, and PD were 1.4%, 6.7%, and 4.2%, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: POEM and LHM have comparable efficacy and may improve patient outcomes.

### Impact of high-resolution manometry on achalasia diagnosis and treatment [^114FvYVT]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

The underlying defect in achalasia cannot be reversed, so treatment remains palliative. The goal of all therapies is to improve esophageal food passage by reducing distal esophageal obstruction, leading to symptomatic relief of dysphagia, regurgitation, and weight gain.

This goal can be achieved through pharmacologic therapy; endoscopic treatment with pneumatic dilation (PD) or botulinum toxin (BOTOX) injection; or surgery. Recently, new therapeutic options such as stent implantation or peroral endoscopic myotomy have been reported. However, the efficacy of these treatment options varies, and the recommendation for the best therapy remains controversial. Although PD and Heller myotomy seem to be the most effective treatments for achalasia, the choice of treatment modality has primarily depended on factors such as patient characteristics, clinical presentation, local expertise, and patient preference. Historically, criteria for high recurrence rates after PD have been defined, including younger age, male gender, and LES > 10 mmHg post-dilation. Nonetheless, some patients do not respond well to either endoscopic or operative approaches, whereas others remain symptom-free for more than 10 years following a single PD. Therefore, other factors might influence therapeutic success.

The new high-resolution manometry subclassification of achalasia distinguishes separate clinical phenotypes that might help predict response to therapy. This scheme is supported by five retrospective studies.

### Efficacy and safety of pneumatic dilation in achalasia: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114FMxFo]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

- **Comparing efficacy between different dilation protocols**: We compared studies that followed a predefined series of dilations (three studies) with studies that performed elective additional dilations in patients with persisting symptoms (seven studies). The second group had a higher remission rate after 6 months (88%) and 12 months of follow-up (86%) when compared to the group that underwent dilations according to a predefined protocol (78% and 75%). The additional dilation group, however, had a wider range of final success rates. Regarding the studies performing a predefined series of dilations, two out of three only dilated up to 30 mm: Chuah et al. and Tanaka et al, and one study dilated up to 35 mm: Smeets et al. This partially explains the lower remission rates in the predefined treatment group when compared to the elective additional dilation group.

Remission rates per article after 6 months (left) and 12 months (right) of follow-up compared studies that used a predefined dilation protocol ("Scheme") with studies in which additional dilations were performed when symptom recurrence occurred ("Redilation").

### Comparative efficacy of first-line therapeutic interventions for achalasia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112gXqjm]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). Low credibility.

There are certain limitations related to both the network meta-analysis as well as individual studies, which merit further discussion. The studies had a short duration of follow-up, and the primary outcome of this network meta-analysis was focused on short-term (1-year) success. Limited post-intervention follow-up prevents the ability to understand long-term comparative efficacy between interventions, which is critical for a chronic disease. There was also a paucity of direct head-to-head comparative trials, particularly comparing POEM to the other treatments. Further, performance and detection bias related to the non-blinded design of included trials introduced a significant risk of bias. Performance and detection biases are not easily avoidable in RCTs testing new devices or techniques in surgery or endoscopy, given the nature of the intervention under study, and this represents a limitation, particularly when considering subjective outcomes such as improvement of symptoms in patients with achalasia. Assessment of vital physiologic outcomes by blinded readers can overcome limitations related to blinding in these trials; however, these outcomes were infrequently and/or inconsistently reported in trials data, which limits the ability to compare post-treatment physiologic efficacy. Similarly, treatment-related adverse events were poorly reported, and a thorough assessment of risk–benefit profile could not be performed. Finally, inherent to network meta-analyses is the risk of misinterpretation due to conceptual heterogeneity, related to differences in participants and interventions.

### Surgical and endoscopic interventions in the management of idiopathic achalasia [^114YmRiS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

Management of achalasia can be challenging. Guided by version 4 of the Chicago Classification (an internationally recognized system used to interpret esophageal manometry results), treatment often relies upon endoscopic or surgical techniques for definitive improvement in symptoms. Endoscopic injection of botulinum toxin into the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) is considered a temporizing measure, and pharmacological treatment (i.e. with calcium channel blockers or nitrates) is infrequently considered due to a relative lack of effectiveness and inconsistent tolerability. Both botulinum toxin and pharmacological approaches are typically reserved for non-operative/non-procedural candidates.

For individuals who can undergo procedures, however, longer-lasting symptom relief is typically afforded by either surgical or endoscopic interventions. In particular, there are three primary procedures: pneumatic dilation, per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM), and laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM). Recently, network meta-analyses reported that POEM and LHM are the preferred modalities in the management of achalasia compared to pneumatic dilation. Furthermore, clinical guidelines recommend different procedures based on achalasia subtype, wherein types I and II achalasia are considered responsive to all of LHM, POEM, and pneumatic dilation, and type III achalasia is primarily responsive to POEM.

### Bronchial hyperresponsiveness induced by chronic treatment with albuterol: Role of sensory nerves [^114AHAeo]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

It has recently been suggested that regular treatment with racemic beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists might result in bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) to a range of spasmogens, and this might be due to adverse effects of the distomer.

- **Objective**: We sought to determine whether BHR induced by means of continuous exposure to racemic and S-albuterol was mediated by sensory nerves.

- **Methods**: Naive or ovalbumin-sensitized guinea pigs were treated for 10 days with RS-, R-, or S-albuterol (1 mg.kg(-1).d(-1)) through subcutaneously implanted minipumps. Lung function was then determined in response to a number of spasmogens and assessed on the basis of an increase in total airway resistance. A separate group of animals was chronically treated with capsaicin (80 mg/kg) before the albuterol treatment.

- **Results**: Treatment with RS- or S-albuterol increased airway responsiveness to bradykinin, leukotriene C(4), and capsaicin in naive guinea pigs (P < 0.05) and to histamine and ovalbumin in immunized guinea pigs (P < 0.05). Chronic treatment with capsaicin prevented the development of RS- and S-albuterol-induced BHR in these models. The bronchodilator efficacy of acute intravenously administered RS-albuterol was unaffected in RS-, R-, or S-albuterol-treated guinea pigs compared with vehicle-treated animals.

- **Conclusion**: We have provided evidence demonstrating that continuous exposure to RS- and S-albuterol increases bronchial responsiveness to a range of stimuli, an effect not attributed to beta-adrenoceptor occupancy or desensitization. Furthermore, capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerves play a crucial role in this process.

### Treatment of achalasia in the era of high-resolution manometry [^116dQQve]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Pharmacological therapy usually has a minor role in the treatment of esophageal achalasia because it is the least effective option. The two most commonly used pharmacological agents are nitrates and calcium channel blockers. Nitrates inhibit normal LES contraction by increasing nitric oxide concentration in smooth muscle cells, which, in turn, increases cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels, promoting muscle relaxation. Wen et al, in a recent review, identified only two randomized studies assessing the success of nitrates in the treatment of achalasia; they concluded that no solid recommendations could be given. Calcium antagonists block calcium entry and hence esophageal muscle contraction. Nifedipine, in sublingual doses of 10–20 mg, 15–30 minutes before meals, is the most used oral drug for achalasia. It inhibits LES contraction and decreases its resting pressure by up to 60%. The clinical response is of short duration because drug tolerance develops rapidly; symptom improvement is incomplete, and side effects such as headache, hypotension, and leg edema are common limiting factors in their use. Thus, these drugs are commonly reserved for patients who cannot or refuse to undergo other more invasive therapies and for those in whom Botox has failed.

### Treatment and surveillance strategies in achalasia: an update [^115mAhee]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Controversy exists regarding the optimal treatment for achalasia and whether surveillance for early recognition of late complications is indicated. Currently, surgical myotomy and pneumatic dilation are the most effective treatments for patients with idiopathic achalasia, and a multicenter, randomized, international trial has confirmed similar efficacy of these treatments, at least in the short term. Clinical predictors of outcome, patient preferences, and local expertise should be considered when deciding on the most appropriate treatment option. Owing to a lack of long-term benefits, endoscopic botulinum toxin injection and medical therapies are reserved for patients of advanced age and those with clinically significant comorbidities. The value of new endoscopic, radiologic, or surgical treatments, such as peroral endoscopic myotomy, esophageal stenting, and robotic-assisted myotomy, has not been fully established. Finally, long-term follow-up data in patients with achalasia support the notion that surveillance strategies might be beneficial following a disease duration of more than 10–15 years.

### Idiopathic (primary) achalasia: A review [^111mdiRM]. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases (2015). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on achalasia:

- **Definition**: Achalasia is an esophageal motility disorder defined by loss of esophageal peristalsis and incomplete relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter.

- **Pathophysiology**: Proposed causes of achalasia include GEJ obstruction, neuronal degeneration, viral infection, genetic inheritance, and autoimmune disease.

- **Disease course**: Inflammatory neurodegenerative insult with possible viral involvement within the esophagus results in achalasia, which causes the clinical manifestation of progressive dysphagia, regurgitation, chest pain, heartburn, nocturnal cough, aspiration, and weight loss. The progression of the disease may result in aspiration-pneumonia, Barrett's esophagus, and esophageal cancer.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Achalasia is not associated with an increase in mortality.

### Efficacy and safety of pneumatic dilation in achalasia: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114b44c7]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

Achalasia is a primary motor disease of the esophagus, manometrically characterized by the loss of peristalsis and a non-relaxing lower esophageal sphincter (LES). The classic presentation includes progressive dysphagia to both solids and liquids, often accompanied by regurgitation of undigested food and chest pain. On radiography, poor esophageal emptying and a very narrow LES are observed, and histopathology shows a loss of neural cells in the myenteric plexus of the esophagus.

Unfortunately, there is no curative treatment that targets the neurodegenerative process. Therefore, all treatments are symptomatic and aim to improve esophageal emptying by reducing LES tone. Currently, the most common and effective interventions are surgical Heller myotomy, per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM), and pneumatic dilation. Many different techniques and treatment protocols have been described for pneumatic dilation. In general, a non-compliant polyethylene balloon (Rigiflex, Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA) is positioned across the LES under fluoroscopic guidance, aided by radiopaque markers on the balloon catheter, and the balloon is inflated with a handheld manometer. Various balloon sizes, the number of dilation sessions, inflation pressures, and inflation durations can be used. Consequently, the reported series are heterogeneous with respect to the treatment protocol. Reported treatment success rates vary from 52% to 99%. The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) guideline for pneumatic dilation in achalasia patients recommends a specific protocol to ensure uniformity and effectiveness.

### Efficacy and safety of pneumatic dilation in achalasia: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112XU3ML]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: To identify studies describing the efficacy of pneumatic dilation in achalasia patients, we searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane. We performed our search on December 8, 2016, using the following terms (including synonyms): "esophageal achalasia", "pneumatic dilation", and "size" or "effect". The exact search is displayed in Appendix S1, and Figure 1 shows a summary of our literature search, screening, and selection.

	- During title and abstract screening, we used the following inclusion criteria: adult patients with primary achalasia; treatment with pneumatic dilation; and article type: no reviews, commentaries, meta‐analyses, or case reports. Next, two authors (FH and LP) separately screened the full text of the remaining articles more accurately using stricter inclusion criteria: no previous treatments; use of Rigiflex balloon and full description of the procedure; use of Eckardt score or a similar validated questionnaire; and full‐text availability. Publications that did not meet the abovementioned criteria were excluded from further analysis.

	- Figure 1 illustrates the flowchart of literature search, screening, and selection.

- **Critical appraisal and article selection**: Of the remaining articles, two authors (FH and LP) independently determined the relevance and validity during critical appraisal using the Newcastle Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale as a guideline. We noted the number of included patients, the study design, the level of evidence, and the inclusion period of the patients. The relevance of the articles was assessed.

### Esophageal achalasia: Pros and cons of the treatment options [^113HZdD8]. World Journal of Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

From the analysis of the pros and cons of the techniques available for treating achalasia, it appears that all options are appropriate, except for BoT injections. These injections should be reserved for patients too ill to undergo more invasive treatments.

Patients with achalasia can be offered pneumatic dilation (PD), laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM) with fundoplication, or peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) after discussing the merits and drawbacks of each option. Generally, the choice of treatment should be left to the patient and not based on the expertise or preferences of their doctor.

PD remains an attractive option due to being well standardized, widely available, relatively safe, and not requiring general anesthesia. However, it has limitations and is generally less effective than LHM or POEM, especially in certain circumstances. Therefore, it should not be offered to children and young adults (under 40 years old) or to patients with type III achalasia. Conversely, complementary PD might be the treatment of choice following a failed LHM or POEM, as it often relieves residual dysphagia in most patients.

While LHM and POEM have a similar profile in terms of efficacy, perioperative complications, and adverse events, it is essential to note that POEM is invasive despite being endoscopically managed. It requires general anesthesia like LHM. Both techniques require skilled surgeons and endoscopists and should be performed only at high-volume centers to ensure optimal outcomes.

### Impact of high-resolution manometry on achalasia diagnosis and treatment [^113sdykr]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

The implementation of high-resolution esophageal pressure topography (HREPT) involved the establishment of a structured classification system, known as the Chicago classification of esophageal motility. After all the swallows are analyzed with the stepwise approach (as described in the now-absent Table 1), the data are used in the Chicago classification to make a diagnosis. As shown in Figure 1, the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) function is assessed first, followed by the characterization of esophageal motor function.

A key feature of the Chicago classification is the hierarchical categorization of esophageal motility disorders into four general groupings: achalasia, esophageal outlet obstruction, abnormalities of esophageal motor function not seen in asymptomatic controls (such as absent peristalsis, distal esophageal spasm, and hypercontractile or jackhammer esophagus), and borderline abnormalities of esophageal function commonly found in asymptomatic individuals (e.g. weak or hypertensive or nutcracker esophagus peristalsis).

### Impact of high-resolution manometry on achalasia diagnosis and treatment [^115CHVeD]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

High-resolution esophageal pressure topography (HREPT) is more sensitive, provides more detailed information, and is easier to perform than conventional manometry (CM). Through analysis algorithms known as the Chicago classification, standardization has improved, leading to increased early recognition of achalasia. This has resulted in the clinically relevant identification of three clinical subtypes of achalasia, which helps predict treatment and disease outcome.

Furthermore, implementing the different phenotypes of achalasia has enhanced our pathophysiologic understanding of the disease. This knowledge holds the potential to lead to individualized management of the disease and to improve outcomes for patients with achalasia.

### Comparative efficacy of first-line therapeutic interventions for achalasia: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113PDtRs]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). High credibility.

This systematic review is reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) for network meta-analyses (PRISMA-NMA) statement and was conducted following a priori established protocol. We also followed good research practices as outlined in the ISPOR (International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research) report on interpreting indirect treatment comparisons and network meta-analysis for health-care decision-making.

- **Selection criteria**: Studies included in this meta-analysis were RCTs with a minimum follow-up of 1 year that met the following inclusion criteria: (a) patients: adults (age > 18 years) with achalasia, treated with (b) interventions and comparators: pneumatic dilation (PD), laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM), and peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM), and reported (c) outcome: treatment success assessed at 1 year.

	- We excluded (a) observational or non-randomized studies, (b) RCTs of endoscopic botulinum toxin injection, as this is considered second-line therapy for patients who are not candidates for first-line therapy, (c) RCTs of oral therapies reserved for patients who are not candidates for first-line therapy (i.e. oral smooth muscle relaxants), and (d) trials with a short duration of follow-up (< 1 year).

- **Search strategy**: The search strategy was conducted by updating a prior systematic literature review performed as part of the recent American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) guidelines through December 2019. Briefly, in this guideline, combinations of subject headings and text words were used, including esophageal achalasia OR cardiospasm OR achalasia OR megaesophagu.

### Efficacy of surgical or endoscopic treatment of idiopathic achalasia: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116ySYLY]. The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Treatment of achalasia has changed substantially over the past 20 years. Therapeutic options offered to patients vary depending on access to both resources and expertise. These options include pneumatic dilation (PD), laparoscopic Heller's myotomy (LHM), and per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM). Although there are head-to-head trials of these interventions, many of these are small and underpowered, making their relative efficacy unknown. A systematic review and network meta-analysis was conducted to address this uncertainty.

- **Methods**:
	- We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, and Embase Classic from database inception up to June 11, 2020, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy of POEM, LHM, or PD, compared with each other in adults with idiopathic achalasia. All data were extracted as dichotomous outcomes (treatment success or failure) after the completion of therapy. We also extracted country of origin, number of centers, duration of follow-up, and primary outcome measure used to define treatment success or failure. Data were extracted for intention-to-treat analyses, with all dropouts assumed to be treatment failures (i.e. symptomatic at the final point of follow-up), wherever trial reporting allowed this. We pooled data using a random effects model and assessed heterogeneity between studies using the I² statistic. Risk of bias was examined for all studies. The primary outcome was efficacy, measured by a dichotomous measure of treatment success or failure following a minimum of 1 year of follow-up. Secondary outcomes were occurrences of…

### The 2018 ISDE achalasia guidelines [^1122Z3Eb]. Diseases of the Esophagus (2018). High credibility.

The Diagnostic Criteria for Achalasia is a clinical tool designed to aid in the diagnosis of achalasia, a rare esophageal motility disorder. The target patient population includes individuals presenting with symptoms suggestive of esophageal motility disorders, such as dysphagia, regurgitation, and chest pain.

The primary components of the diagnostic criteria are derived from esophageal manometry testing. The first component is an integrated relaxation pressure above the upper limit of normal, indicating impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter. The second component is the presence of 100% failed peristalsis or spasm, reflecting the absence of normal esophageal contractions.

The diagnosis of achalasia is confirmed if both components are present; if either or both components are absent, the diagnostic criteria for achalasia are not met. The use of these criteria provides a standardized approach to the diagnosis of achalasia, facilitating early detection and appropriate management of the condition.

The diagnostic criteria for achalasia evaluation utilize esophageal motility testing to determine the presence of specific motility abnormalities. The diagnostic process relies on two key measurements obtained via esophageal manometry:

- **Integrated relaxation pressure (IRP)**: If the IRP is above the established upper limit of normal, this suggests a lack of adequate relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) during swallowing.

### Esophageal achalasia: Pros and cons of the treatment options [^113WcrPh]. World Journal of Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Achalasia is a rare disease, with an incidence of 0.5–1.0 patient per 100,000 population a year. It is nonetheless the most common and most extensively studied esophageal motility disorder. Despite improvements in our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease, its etiology remains largely obscure. A functional obstruction at the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) and the gradual loss of esophageal peristalsis are responsible for the clinical symptoms, with dilation of the gullet progressing in the final stages to decompensated megaesophagus.

As the etiology of the disease is unknown, the aim of treatments is to address the functional abnormalities it causes. Unfortunately, there is no treatment available at present for the loss of peristalsis. The goal of current therapies is to overcome the functional obstruction of the unrelaxing lower esophageal sphincter (LES), relying on gravity to ensure the passage of food through an adynamic gullet. Since pharmacological options for achalasia are impractical or produce disappointing results, it is treated by paralyzing, tearing, or cutting the unrelaxing muscle fibers of the LES, either endoscopically or surgically.

The endoscopic treatment of achalasia with pneumatic dilations (PD) or botulinum toxin (BoT) injections was the mainstay of therapy for most of the second half of the last century, challenged only in the '90s by laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM). Endoscopic treatments have recently been revitalized by the introduction and rapid diffusion of peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM).

### Ventolinhfa [^115v5V7k]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: Other short-acting sympathomimetic aerosol bronchodilators should not be used concomitantly with albuterol. If additional adrenergic drugs are to be administered by any route, they should be used with caution to avoid deleterious cardiovascular effects.

- **Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents**: Beta-blockers not only block the pulmonary effect of beta-agonists, such as Ventolin HFA, but may also produce severe bronchospasm in patients with asthma. Therefore, patients with asthma should not normally be treated with beta-blockers. However, under certain circumstances, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents for these patients; cardioselective beta-blockers could be considered, although they should be administered with caution.

- **Non–potassium-sparing diuretics**: The ECG changes and/or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of non–potassium-sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by beta-agonists, especially when the recommended dose of the beta-agonist is exceeded. Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the coadministration of Ventolin HFA with non–potassium-sparing diuretics.

- **Digoxin**: Mean decreases of 16% to 22% in serum digoxin levels were demonstrated after single-dose intravenous and oral administration of albuterol, respectively, to normal volunteers who had received digoxin for 10 days. The clinical relevance of these findings for patients with obstructive airway disease who are receiving such treatment remains to be fully elucidated.

### Albuterol [^114e1U9x]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

The following dosages of albuterol tablets are expressed in terms of albuterol base.

- **Usual dosage**:
	- **Adults and children over 12 years of age**: The usual starting dosage for adults and children 12 years and older is 2 or 4 mg three or four times a day.
	- **Children 6 to 12 years of age**: The usual starting dosage for children 6 to 12 years of age is 2 mg three or four times a day.

- **Dosage adjustment**:
	- **Adults and children over 12 years of age**: For adults and children 12 years and older, a dosage above 4 mg four times a day should be used only when the patient fails to respond. If a favorable response does not occur with the 4 mg initial dosage, it should be cautiously increased stepwise up to a maximum of 8 mg four times a day as tolerated.
	- **Children 6 to 12 years of age who fail to respond to the initial starting dosage of 2 mg four times a day**: For children from 6 to 12 years of age who fail to respond to the initial dosage of 2 mg four times a day, the dosage may be cautiously increased stepwise, but not to exceed 24 mg/day (given in divided doses).

- **Elderly patients and those sensitive to beta-adrenergic stimulators**: An initial dosage of 2 mg three or four times a day is recommended for elderly patients and for those with a history of unusual sensitivity to beta-adrenergic stimulators. If adequate bronchodilation is not obtained, the dosage may be increased gradually to as much as 8 mg three or four times a day.

The total daily dose should not exceed 32 mg in adults and children 12 years and older.

### Achalasia: Current therapeutic options [^111TKFMX]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). High credibility.

Achalasia is an esophageal motor disorder characterized by impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and absent peristalsis in the smooth muscle esophageal body. As a result, patients typically experience dysphagia, regurgitation, chest pain, and weight loss. Over the past 10–15 years, there has been a resurgence of interest in the evaluation of therapies for achalasia. Unfortunately, little progress in the development of effective pharmacological treatments has been made. Botulinum toxin injection provides some relief of symptoms in many patients but requires periodic reinjection, which may offer progressively less benefit over time.

There are now three well-established, safe, and effective therapies for treating achalasia: pneumatic dilation (PD), laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM), and peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM), which can lead to marked symptom improvement in most patients. Each treatment has a specific set of risks, benefits, and recurrence rates. The first-line treatment used will depend on patient preference, achalasia subtype, and local expertise. This paper explores the recent impressive advances in both the art and science of achalasia therapy with a comprehensive review of the various treatment modalities and comparative controlled clinical trials. In addition, key technical pearls of the procedural treatments are demonstrated.
