## Question

what condition has low iron, low TIBC, normal iron saturation, elevated ferritin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which condition is suggested by a lab pattern of low serum iron, low TIBC, normal transferrin saturation, and elevated ferritin. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about classic iron study patterns and which entities they map to. Then, I should verify the pathophysiologic mechanisms, especially hepcidin's role. Next, I will compare distinguishing features such as TIBC directionality. After that, I need to check for caveats like mixed etiologies and the limits of ferritin and TSAT in inflammation. Finally, I will consider guideline-supported confirmatory tests and management steps, while monitoring for exceptions and ensuring the diagnosis remains one of exclusion.

> Let me first confirm the pattern-to-phenotype mapping. In pure iron deficiency anemia, I would expect low serum iron, high TIBC, low TSAT, and low ferritin, whereas in anemia of inflammation I should see low serum iron, low TIBC due to transferrin being a negative acute-phase reactant, variable or normal-to-low TSAT, and elevated ferritin as an acute-phase reactant; this provided pattern aligns with anemia of inflammation rather than isolated iron deficiency, so I should keep that front-of-mind while I verify each element against references [^111wSktU].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology to ensure internal consistency. Inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-6, upregulate hepatic hepcidin, which blocks ferroportin, reducing duodenal iron absorption and trapping iron in macrophages and hepatocytes, producing hypoferremia despite adequate or increased stores; simultaneously, transferrin synthesis falls in inflammation, and ferritin rises as an acute-phase protein, explaining low iron, low TIBC, and high ferritin, with TSAT potentially appearing preserved if both iron and binding capacity decrease in tandem, which mechanistically fits this profile [^111wSktU] [^117SGuKh].

> Hold on, I should verify the discriminating features. The low TIBC is a critical differentiator because TIBC rises in iron deficiency as the liver produces more transferrin, but falls in inflammatory states, and when both serum iron and TIBC decline proportionately, TSAT may be normal despite iron-restricted erythropoiesis, so a normal TSAT does not exclude anemia of inflammation in this context [^111wSktU] [^117NHivW].

> Hmm, wait a minute — my initial instinct might be to say "elevated ferritin rules out iron deficiency", but I need to correct that because ferritin increases with inflammation independent of iron stores; in inflammatory states a higher ferritin cutoff, often around 100 μg/L, is used to define iron deficiency, and in IBD specifically, ferritin greater than 100 μg/L with TSAT less than 20% supports anemia of chronic disease, so I should not over-interpret a high ferritin as excluding concomitant iron deficiency without context [^111wSktU] [^1162718v].

> Next, I should review the clinical context because anemia of inflammation is typically a diagnosis of exclusion and requires an underlying inflammatory condition, such as CKD, IBD, cancer, chronic infection, autoimmune disease, heart failure, or obesity; I need to check for these drivers and exclude alternative causes like bleeding, hemolysis, B12 or folate deficiency before anchoring on anemia of inflammation [^117SGuKh] [^112RQe65].

> But wait, what if there is concomitant true iron deficiency masked by inflammation. Let me consider confirmatory tools: the soluble transferrin receptor is relatively less affected by inflammation, and an elevated sTfR/log ferritin index, often using a threshold around 14, suggests iron deficiency even in the presence of inflammation; low hepcidin levels, for example below about 20 μg/L, point toward absolute iron deficiency or combined anemia rather than pure anemia of inflammation; additional red cell indices such as reticulocyte hemoglobin content and low hemoglobin density can help detect iron-restricted erythropoiesis in IBD, and while zinc protoporphyrin has been touted as unaffected by ACD, I should double-check because zinc deficiency can make ZPP falsely low, so I need to interpret it cautiously [^115iRmFf] [^111wSktU] [^115BJkw6] [^116Gsnzf].

> Let me synthesize the answer now. The pattern of low serum iron, low TIBC, normal TSAT, and elevated ferritin is most consistent with anemia of inflammation or anemia of chronic disease, driven by hepcidin-mediated iron sequestration and reduced transferrin, with preserved TSAT possible when iron and binding capacity fall together; this is mechanistically coherent and matches guideline descriptions, though I still need to rule out mixed anemia with concurrent true iron deficiency [^111wSktU] [^117SGuKh].

> I need to ensure the clinical interpretation is precise. Functionally, this reflects iron being present in stores but unavailable for erythropoiesis due to inflammatory blockade, sometimes termed functional iron deficiency; however, treatment decisions often hinge on TSAT less than 20% and clinical severity, and a normal TSAT in this pattern should prompt me to treat the underlying inflammation first while surveilling for a decline in TSAT or hemoglobin that would justify iron therapy, keeping in mind that functional iron deficiency can exist with normal or high ferritin [^111wSktU].

> Next, I should review management implications. The primary approach is to treat the underlying inflammatory condition and correct other reversible causes of anemia before initiating ESAs; in settings like active IBD with poor absorption or ongoing inflammation, IV iron is preferred over oral iron, and in CKD or ESA-treated patients, iron supplementation is generally guided by thresholds such as ferritin less than 100 μg/L or TSAT less than 20%, while avoiding excessive iron accumulation and targeting conservative hemoglobin goals to mitigate risk [^111M5RPV] [^115HsamL] [^115WRUmV].

> I should confirm the necessary diagnostic workup and monitoring. Baseline evaluation should include CBC, reticulocyte indices, ferritin, TSAT, B12, folate, and hemolysis testing, and if anemia of inflammation is suspected in IBD, regular interval screening is recommended, with frequency tailored to disease activity and clinical status to catch evolving combined deficiencies or shifts toward iron-responsive patterns [^116oqmLu] [^112RQe65] [^114Acp5z].

> In summary, after verifying the pattern, pathophysiology, and guideline criteria, the most likely diagnosis is anemia of inflammation, with the caveat that mixed anemia is common; I should exclude coexisting iron deficiency with inflammation-aware markers such as sTfR/log ferritin index or hepcidin when available, treat the inflammatory driver, and use IV iron selectively when TSAT falls below 20% or when absorption is compromised, reassessing dynamically as the inflammatory state changes [^111wSktU] [^1162718v].

The condition with low serum iron, low TIBC, normal iron saturation, and elevated ferritin is **anemia of chronic disease (ACD)** [^117SGuKh], also called anemia of inflammation. This pattern reflects **hepcidin-driven iron sequestration** in macrophages [^111wSktU], reduced transferrin [^117NHivW], and ferritin elevation as an acute-phase reactant [^1124kgh5], producing functional iron deficiency with normal or mildly reduced transferrin saturation [^111wSktU] [^111wSktU].

---

## Pathophysiology of anemia of chronic disease

ACD arises from **chronic inflammation** (infection, autoimmune disease, malignancy, CKD) and is primarily mediated by hepcidin, which:

- **Inhibits iron export**: Binds ferroportin, reducing iron release from macrophages and enterocytes, causing hypoferremia despite adequate stores [^1114Y6P7] [^111wSktU].

- **Reduces transferrin**: Inflammation lowers transferrin synthesis, decreasing TIBC [^117NHivW] [^111wSktU].

- **Elevates ferritin**: Ferritin rises as an acute-phase reactant, reflecting inflammation more than true iron stores [^1124kgh5] [^111wSktU].

- **Suppresses erythropoiesis**: Cytokines blunt erythropoietin production and erythroid proliferation, worsening anemia [^117SGuKh] [^114BsmYh] [^114MxGoS].

---

## Laboratory findings in anemia of chronic disease

| **Laboratory parameter** | **Typical findings in ACD** |
|-|-|
| Serum iron | Low [^117SGuKh] |
| Total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) | Low [^111wSktU] |
| Transferrin saturation | Normal or mildly reduced [^111CX2fR] |
| Ferritin | Elevated [^1124kgh5] |
| Hemoglobin | Low (normocytic or mildly microcytic anemia) [^116xxuaK] |
| C-reactive protein (CRP) | Elevated [^111wSktU] |
| Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) | Elevated [^116xxuaK] |

---

## Clinical conditions associated with anemia of chronic disease

ACD is common in **chronic inflammatory states**, including [^117SGuKh]:

- **Chronic infections**: Tuberculosis, HIV, endocarditis [^117SGuKh].

- **Autoimmune diseases**: Rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus [^117SGuKh].

- **Chronic kidney disease**: Reduced erythropoietin and inflammation [^115HsamL].

- **Malignancies**: Solid tumors and hematologic cancers [^1169x3Bz].

- **Chronic inflammatory diseases**: Inflammatory bowel disease, chronic heart failure [^117Nt3Kn].

---

## Differentiation from other iron-related disorders

ACD must be distinguished from other **iron disorders** [^117SGuKh]. Iron deficiency anemia shows low serum iron, high TIBC, low ferritin, and low transferrin saturation [^111wSktU]. Iron overload disorders (e.g. hemochromatosis) present with high serum iron, high ferritin, high transferrin saturation, and normal or high TIBC. Functional iron deficiency presents with low serum iron and normal or high ferritin with low transferrin saturation, often in CKD or during ESA therapy [^111CX2fR] [^116oxpC2].

---

## Clinical implications and management

ACD reflects underlying inflammation and is associated with worse outcomes in chronic disease [^117SGuKh]. Management focuses on:

- **Treat the cause**: Control the underlying inflammatory or chronic disease [^116xxuaK].

- **Iron therapy**: IV iron may help when functional iron deficiency limits erythropoiesis [^113EnEoR] [^111wSktU].

- **ESAs**: Consider in CKD or cancer-related anemia after correcting iron deficiency [^115HsamL] [^1169x3Bz].

- **Monitor**: Track hemoglobin, ferritin, and transferrin saturation to guide therapy and avoid iron overload [^116oqmLu] [^113TEwKM].

---

The condition with low serum iron, low TIBC, normal iron saturation, and elevated ferritin is **anemia of chronic disease**, driven by hepcidin-mediated iron sequestration and inflammation [^117SGuKh]. Management centers on treating the underlying disease, correcting iron deficiency, and selective use of ESAs [^115HsamL].

### Recommendations from the International Consensus Conference on Anemia Management in Surgical Patients (ICCAMS) [^111wSktU]. Annals of Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Iron deficiency is considered to be present if ferritin is < 30 ng/mL and/or TSAT is < 20%. It has been considered uncommon in patients with anemia of inflammation (or anemia of chronic disease), but this may be attributable to difficulties using the usual iron parameters in this setting.

Because ferritin is an acute-phase reactant in inflammatory states, ferritin levels are often elevated independent of iron status. Therefore, a higher cutoff (< 100 µg/L) is needed to define IDA in these settings. In inflammatory states, serum iron and total iron-binding capacity are generally low, limiting the utility of TSAT for diagnosing IDA. This may be explained by the potential for inflammation to dysregulate iron homeostasis.

The key regulator of iron homeostasis is hepcidin, a peptide that is produced primarily by hepatocytes. Increased hepcidin levels decrease iron absorption from the gut and iron release from macrophages and hepatocytes. In inflammatory states, hepcidin levels generally increase as a response to inflammatory cytokines, and the net effect is decreased iron availability for erythropoiesis. Patients with inflammatory disorders and iron deficiency exhibit lower levels of hepcidin than those with "pure" anemia of inflammation. Consequently, hepcidin levels can help distinguish between IDA and other anemias where there is no iron deficiency. The serum hepcidin level may be more reliable than ferritin or TSAT for identifying iron deficiency.

For example, in patients discharged from the intensive care unit, a low hepcidin level (< 20 µg/L) identified iron deficiency in 37% of patients.

### Serum ferritin is derived primarily from macrophages through a nonclassical secretory pathway [^1124kgh5]. Blood (2010).

The serum ferritin concentration is a clinical parameter widely measured for the differential diagnosis of anemia. Its levels increase with elevations of tissue iron stores and inflammation. However, studies on cellular sources of serum ferritin, as well as its subunit composition, degree of iron loading, and glycosylation, have produced conflicting results. To gain further understanding of serum ferritin, we have used traditional and modern methodologies to characterize mouse serum ferritin. We find that both splenic macrophages and proximal tubule cells of the kidney are possible cellular sources for serum ferritin, and that serum ferritin is secreted by cells rather than being the product of a cytosolic leak from damaged cells.

Mouse serum ferritin is composed mostly of L-subunits, contains few H-subunits, and has low iron content. L-subunits of serum ferritin are frequently truncated at the C-terminus, giving rise to a characteristic 17-kD band that has been previously observed in lysosomal ferritin. Taken together with the fact that mouse serum ferritin is not detectably glycosylated, we propose that mouse serum ferritin is secreted through the nonclassical lysosomal secretory pathway.

Anemia of inflammation (AI) is a highly prevalent comorbidity in patients affected by chronic inflammatory disorders, such as chronic kidney disease, inflammatory bowel disease, or cancer, that negatively affect disease outcome and quality of life. The pathophysiology of AI is multifactorial, with inflammatory hypoferremia and iron-restricted erythropoiesis playing a major role in the context of disease-specific factors. Here, we review the recent progress in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms contributing to iron dysregulation in AI, the impact of hypoferremia and anemia on the course of the underlying disease, and novel therapeutic strategies applied to treat AI.

### Intravenous iron, inflammation, and oxidative stress: Is iron a friend or an enemy of uremic patients [^113EnEoR]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Intravenous iron supplementation is a recognized therapy for anemia in chronic hemodialysis patients, particularly for those treated with erythropoietin. The vast majority of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) appear to be iron-deficient, as assessed by standard parameters and iron staining on bone marrow biopsy, due to multiple interferences with phases of iron metabolism. The need for iron supplementation in CKD patients becomes evident.

Intravenous iron has been demonstrated to be superior to oral iron in hemodialysis patients. Evidence also supports its superiority in peritoneal dialysis and nondialysis-dependent CKD patients. However, intravenous iron can promote cytotoxicity and tissue injury, exacerbating oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and the progression of both CKD and cardiovascular disease. Nonetheless, the correction of anemia effectively reduces oxidative stress and, consequently, cardiovascular risk. The overall risk-benefit ratio supports the use of intravenous iron, either alone or with an erythropoietic stimulating agent, in managing renal anemia. Clinical judgment is essential in each individual case to diagnose iron deficiency and effectively utilize intravenous iron.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: Update of anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^112RQe65]. BMC Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for anemia of chronic kidney disease, and more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, the UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend the following tests to diagnose the cause of anemia in selected cases:

- **Serum B12 and serum folate concentrations**: These should be measured to evaluate vitamin levels that may contribute to anemia.

- **Tests for hemolysis**: Include plasma/serum levels of haptoglobin, LDH, bilirubin, and Coombs' test to assess for any red blood cell destruction.

- **Plasma/serum and/or urine protein electrophoresis**: Conducted to detect abnormal proteins in the blood or urine.

- **Hemoglobin electrophoresis**: This test helps to identify different types of hemoglobin and detect abnormalities.

- **Free light chains and bone marrow examination**: These are used in certain cases to provide further diagnostic information.

### Management of iron deficiency anemia in inflammatory bowel disease - a practical approach [^116Gsnzf]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Zinc protoporphyrin was pinpointed by Dagg and colleagues as early as 1966 as a potential indicator of iron deficiency (ID). In the terminal reaction in heme synthesis — catalyzed by the mitochondrial enzyme ferrochelatase — iron is chelated by protoporphyrin while the metal-binding site on ferrochelatase may be claimed by iron or zinc. A reduction in iron supply for erythropoiesis to a suboptimal level results in the production of zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP) instead of heme, with zinc, instead of iron, being incorporated into protoporphyrin IX. Thus, ZPP levels are a direct marker of iron status in the bone marrow during erythropoiesis. ZPP production is entirely unaffected by anemia of chronic disease (ACD) or other chronic inflammation and is therefore an effective indicator of ID even in the presence of inflammation.

The onset of iron-deficient erythropoiesis triggers continuously increasing ZPP concentrations. Concentrations of 80 μmol/mol heme are associated with manifest iron deficiency. In severe cases, values up to 1000 μmol/mol heme have been reported. Thus, ZPP determination not only detects iron-deficient erythropoiesis but can also quantify it. Theoretically, as zinc deficiency is also not uncommon in inflammatory disorders, ZPP values may be false negative in zinc deficiency patients.

The choice of laboratory parameter depends on both the clinical question posed and the availability of the respective test. However, the first-line parameter for assessing iron metabolism in routine practice has not been clearly specified.

### Management of iron deficiency anemia in inflammatory bowel disease - a practical approach [^1122PKte]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Although anemia is the most common systemic manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) among the broad spectrum of extraintestinal disease complications encountered in IBD, including arthritis and osteopathy, it has generally received little consideration. However, not only in terms of frequency, but also with regard to its potential effect on hospitalization rates and on the quality of life and work, anemia is indeed a significant and costly complication of IBD.

Anemia is multifactorial in nature, with the most prevalent etiological forms being iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and anemia of chronic disease. In a condition associated with inflammation, such as IBD, determining iron status using common biochemical parameters alone is inadequate. A more accurate assessment may be attained using new iron indices, including reticulocyte hemoglobin content, percentage of hypochromic red cells, or zinc protoporphyrin.

While oral iron supplementation has traditionally been a mainstay of IDA treatment, it has also been linked to extensive gastrointestinal side effects and possible disease exacerbation. However, many physicians are still reluctant to administer iron intravenously, despite the wide availability of a variety of new IV preparations with improved safety profiles and despite the recommendations of international expert guidelines.

This article discusses improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies based on new clinical insights into the regulation of iron homeostasis.

### Anemia in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease [^115H4ozj]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is the most frequent extra-intestinal finding in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence and types of anemia in pediatric patients with IBD at diagnosis and at approximately one year of follow-up.

- **Methods**: This is a retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with IBD from 2005 to 2012, ages 1 to 18 years. Patients who had hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, and iron indices obtained at the time of diagnosis and at approximately one year of follow-up were included in the study. The prevalence of anemia at the beginning and the end of the study was recorded. Using the soluble transferrin receptor index, the type of anemia was determined.

- **Results**: At diagnosis, 67.31% of patients were anemic. Overall, 28.85% of patients had either iron deficiency anemia (IDA) or a combination of IDA and anemia of chronic disease (ACD), whereas 38.46% had ACD alone. At follow-up, 20.51% were anemic; 15.38% had either IDA or a combination of IDA and ACD, and 5.13% had ACD alone. The pattern of anemia and response to therapy differed among the IBD phenotypes. Anemia is frequent in inflammatory bowel disease, with prevalence higher in Crohn's disease (CD). At one year, the prevalence of anemia decreased significantly but persisted. Anemia of chronic disease predominated in CD, and iron deficiency anemia continued to be present in CD and ulcerative colitis.

### Anemia of inflammation [^117SGuKh]. Blood (2019). Low credibility.

Anemia of inflammation (AI), also known as anemia of chronic disease (ACD), is regarded as the most frequent anemia in hospitalized and chronically ill patients. It is prevalent in patients with diseases that cause prolonged immune activation, including infection, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. More recently, the list has grown to include chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, chronic pulmonary diseases, and obesity. Inflammation-inducible cytokines and the master regulator of iron homeostasis, hepcidin, block intestinal iron absorption and cause iron retention in reticuloendothelial cells, resulting in iron-restricted erythropoiesis.

In addition, shortened erythrocyte half-life, suppressed erythropoietin response to anemia, and inhibition of erythroid cell differentiation by inflammatory mediators further contribute to AI in a disease-specific pattern. Although the diagnosis of AI is a diagnosis of exclusion and is supported by characteristic alterations in iron homeostasis, hypoferremia, and hyperferritinemia, the diagnosis of AI patients with coexisting iron deficiency is more difficult. In addition to treatment of the disease underlying AI, the combination of iron therapy and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents can improve anemia in many patients.

In the future, emerging therapeutics that antagonize hepcidin function and redistribute endogenous iron for erythropoiesis may offer additional options. However, based on experience with anemia treatment in chronic kidney disease, critical illness, and cancer, finding the appropriate indications for the specific treatment remains challenging.

### Iron deficiency is highly prevalent among candidates for metabolic surgery and may affect perioperative outcomes [^117LtQNM]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

The presence of chronic low-grade inflammation, commonly identified in patients with severe obesity, alters iron homeostasis and indicators of iron status, fostering the development of updated guidelines for the diagnosis of iron deficiency (ID). Recommended diagnostic thresholds for ID in obesity derived from expert opinion include a ferritin level of < 30 ng/mL and/or transferrin saturation (TSAT) < 20%. Earlier studies of ID among candidates for metabolic surgery using low levels of ferritin or iron as diagnostic thresholds demonstrated a prevalence of 5%-20%.

- **Objectives**: Using the recommended diagnostic thresholds for ID, this study measures the prevalence of ID in a large cohort of surgical candidates and its relationship to surgical outcomes.

- **Setting**: Geisinger Medical Center, Danville, Pennsylvania.

- **Methods**: The study cohort included 3,723 patients who underwent pre-operative nutritional assessment, which included markers of iron nutrition over the period 2004–2018.

- **Results**: The cohort included 2,988 women (80.3%) and 735 men (19.7%); body mass index: 49.4 ± 9 kg/m². The diagnosis of ID was based on ferritin level < 30 ng/mL (true ID) and/or TSAT < 20%, representing a combination of true ID and inflammation (serum ferritin ≥ 30 ng/mL and TSAT < 20%). A total of 399 patients (10.8%) were anemic. A serum ferritin level of < 30 ng/mL was found in 488 patients (13%; 481 women and 7 men). Of these, 122 patients (25.2%) were also anemic. An additional 1,204 had serum ferritin ≥ 30 ng/mL and TSAT < 20%. Overall, 1,692 patients (45.4%) in this cohort were identified with ID.

- **Absolute reticulocyte count**: Provides insight into marrow production success in response to anemia.
- **Serum ferritin level**: Indicates the amount of stored iron.
- **Serum transferrin saturation**: Measures the percentage of transferrin that is saturated with iron.
- **Serum vitamin B12 and folate levels**: Important for identifying potential deficiencies that may contribute to anemia.

### An exploratory analysis of routine ferritin measurement upon admission and the prognostic implications of low-grade ferritinemia during inflammation [^113j4wkN]. The American Journal of Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Serum ferritin is usually measured in the presence of anemia or in suspected iron overload syndromes. Ferritin is also an acute-phase protein that is elevated during systemic inflammation. However, the prognostic value of routinely measuring ferritin upon admission to a medical facility is not clear. Therefore, we examined the association between ferritin concentrations measured at the time of hospital admission with 30-day and long-term mortality.

- **Methods**: We obtained routine ferritin measurements taken within 24 hours of admission in 2,859 patients hospitalized in an internal medicine department. Multiple clinical and laboratory parameters were used to assess the association between ferritin and overall mortality during a median follow-up of 15 months (interquartile range [IQR] 8–22).

- **Results**: Ferritin levels were associated with increased 30-day mortality rates (odds ratio [OR] 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03–1.06) for each 100 ng/mL increase. Patients with intermediate (78–220 ng/mL) and high (> 221 ng/mL) ferritin concentrations (2nd and 3rd tertiles) had higher 30-day mortality rates even after adjustment for age, sex, and existing comorbidities (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.70–2.5). Long-term overall mortality rates demonstrated a similar pattern across ferritin tertiles (hazard ratio [HR] 1.54, 95% CI 1.39–1.71).

- **Conclusions**: Routine admission ferritin concentrations are linearly and independently correlated with excess mortality risk in hospitalized patients, even those with apparently "normal" ferritin concentrations (< 300 mg/mL).

### Anemia from inflammation after intracerebral hemorrhage and relationships with outcome [^117NHivW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Anemia from inflammation is characterized by inflammation's inhibition of dietary iron absorption while increasing iron sequestration in macrophages through hepcidin. This is thought to promote evolutionarily developed efforts to decrease circulating iron, which normally facilitates bacterial proliferation and etiology. This serum iron decrement is accompanied by decrements in transferrin, the primary circulating binding protein of iron. Meanwhile, serum ferritin, representing secreted iron from iron-filled macrophages and an inflammatory acute-phase reactant, conversely increases. Additionally, RBC half-life is shortened, and erythropoiesis response to anemia is also suppressed. This type of multimodal impairment of RBC survival and erythropoiesis is known to be a major driver of anemia development and maintenance in critical illness. Our study recapitulates these well-known iron biomarker characteristics seen with inflammation in a novel patient population with ICH.

However, it is worth mentioning that while certain studies have suggested that anemia of inflammation can manifest acutely, the inflammatory impairment of erythropoiesis has been thought to be a more prolonged and chronic process. Thus, we cannot exclude that the kinetics of the hemoglobin decrements identified in our ICH cohorts over the initial days were in part due to other superimposed unmeasured processes seen in critical illness, like hemolysis, phlebotomy, hemodilution, fluid resuscitation, or other sources of blood loss or clearance. Yet it is worth mentioning that we adjusted for ICH severity, systemic medi…

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: Update of anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^111CX2fR]. BMC Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for anemia of chronic kidney disease, the UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend considering a transferrin saturation of less than 20% and a normal or elevated ferritin level to define functional iron deficiency in patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD or those maintained on peritoneal dialysis, as well as in individuals receiving hemodialysis. It is important to recognize that normal or high serum ferritin values do not exclude iron deficiency because this could be due to other causes, such as infection or inflammation.

### Regulation of iron homeostasis in anemia of chronic disease and iron deficiency anemia: Diagnostic and therapeutic implications [^1114Y6P7]. Blood (2009). Low credibility.

The anemia of chronic disease (ACD) is characterized by macrophage iron retention induced by cytokines and the master regulator hepcidin. Hepcidin controls cellular iron efflux by binding to the iron export protein, ferroportin. Many patients, however, present with both ACD and iron deficiency anemia (ACD/IDA), with the latter resulting from chronic blood loss.

A rat model of ACD, resulting from chronic arthritis, mimicked ACD/IDA through additional phlebotomy to define differing iron-regulatory pathways. Iron retention during inflammation occurs in macrophages and the spleen, but not in the liver. In rats and humans with ACD, serum hepcidin concentrations are elevated, which is paralleled by reduced duodenal and macrophage expression of ferroportin.

Individuals with ACD/IDA have significantly lower hepcidin levels than ACD subjects. In contrast to ACD subjects, ACD/IDA individuals are able to absorb dietary iron from the gut and mobilize iron from macrophages. Circulating hepcidin levels affect iron traffic in both ACD and ACD/IDA and are more responsive to the erythropoietic demands for iron than to inflammation. Hepcidin determination may aid in differentiating between ACD and ACD/IDA and in selecting appropriate therapy for these patients.

### Diagnostic utility of low hemoglobin density to detect iron deficiency in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^115BJkw6]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

In the absence of a feasible noninvasive gold standard, iron deficiency (ID) anemia (IDA) is best measured using multiple indicators. However, the choice of an appropriate single iron biomarker for ID screening continues to be debated. Low hemoglobin density (LHD%) from Coulter counters has been suggested as a useful tool to detect ID. This study investigated the reliability of LHD% for the assessment of iron status in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and IDA, anemia of chronic disease (ACD), or mixed anemia (MIX).

- **Methods**: The study population consisted of 143 patients with IBD (aged 39.03 ± 12.53 years, 61.5% female). Blood count, transferrin saturation, serum ferritin, and C-reactive protein were determined by routine assays. Patients with anemia were divided into three groups: IDA, ACD, and MIX, according to specific criteria. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed.

- **Results**: ROC analysis for LHD% in the detection of ID yielded a cutoff value of 3.8%. In anemic patients, LHD% values did not differ statistically significantly between groups (IDA, ACD, MIX), and no significant difference in LHD% values was observed between patients with IDA and ID.

- **Conclusions**: These results demonstrate that LHD% is a reliable biomarker for the detection of iron deficiency in patients with IBD and anemia, regardless of whether inflammation is present. Our findings indicate that LHD% can provide added value in diagnosing iron deficiency.

### New concepts in the diagnosis and management approach to iron deficiency in candidates for metabolic surgery: Should we change our practice [^112bNqPw]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

The near-universal presence of chronic low-grade systemic inflammation among patients with severe obesity disrupts iron homeostasis and underlies the association between obesity and iron deficiency. Immune activation and inflammation result in a reduction in circulating iron and diminished iron bioavailability for erythropoiesis. Inflammation also alters blood levels of commonly measured markers of iron nutrition status, which makes the diagnosis of iron deficiency difficult and has led to new recommendations regarding laboratory markers for the diagnosis. Recent evidence using these newly recommended laboratory markers, which include levels of ferritin, C-reactive protein, and transferrin saturation, suggests that the actual prevalence of iron deficiency among candidates for metabolic surgery may be double or triple the prevalence identified by low levels of ferritin alone. Thus, large numbers of surgical candidates have iron deficiency that has been heretofore largely unrecognized and inadequately treated. The assessment of iron status using the currently recommended markers in the presence of chronic inflammatory diseases and repletion of depleted stores for surgical candidates with deficiency during the preoperative period present an important opportunity for mitigating this condition in postoperative patients.

### Proinflammatory state, hepcidin, and anemia in older persons [^111mY6LT]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

In patients with overt inflammatory diseases, up-regulated hepcidin impairs iron absorption and macrophage release, causing anemia. Whether the mild proinflammatory state of aging is associated with increased hepcidin is unknown. We characterized the relationships between urinary hepcidin, iron status, anemia, and inflammation in 582 patients aged 65 years or older participating in the InCHIANTI (Invecchiare in Chianti, "Aging in the Chianti Area") study, a population-based study of aging in Tuscany, Italy.

Compared with non-anemic persons, urinary hepcidin (nanograms/milligram of urinary creatinine) was significantly lower in iron deficiency and inflammation anemia compared with no anemia or other anemia types. Urinary hepcidin was positively correlated with log(ferritin) and negatively correlated with the soluble transferrin receptor/log(ferritin) ratio but not correlated with markers of inflammation: interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and C-reactive protein (CRP). Lower iron was significantly correlated with higher IL-6 and CRP.

Adjusting for confounders, IL-6 and CRP remained significantly associated with serum iron, with no evidence that such a relationship was accounted for by variability in urinary hepcidin. In conclusion, elevated proinflammatory markers were associated with anemia and low iron status, but not with higher urinary hepcidin. Future studies should test whether hepcidin production becomes up-regulated only in situations of overt inflammation.

### Soluble transferrin receptor-ferritin index in the evaluation of anemia in inflammatory bowel disease: a case-control study [^1111Howb]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

- **Summary box**:

	- **What is already known**: No reliable biochemical markers exist for the differentiation between iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and anemia of chronic disease (ACD) in the setting of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). There is evidence that soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) is not influenced by chronic or acute inflammation. Literature data suggest that the soluble transferrin receptor-ferritin (sTfR-F) index has high diagnostic power in the diagnosis of IDA.

	- **What the new findings are**: A high sTfR-F index has better discriminating power than high sTfR levels in the diagnosis of IDA. The sTfR-F index is a very efficient marker for the detection and diagnosis of IDA among patients with IBD. The sTfR-F index could be proposed as an addition to the established markers for the diagnosis of IDA in patients with IBD.

### Diagnosis and treatment of anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^114nUyag]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Anemia represents one of the most frequent complications in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and severely impairs the quality of life of affected patients. The etiology of anemia in IBD patients can be multifactorial, often involving a combination of iron deficiency (ID) and anemia of chronic disease (ACD). Although guidelines recommend screening for and treating anemia in IBD patients, observational data suggest that it still remains underdiagnosed and undertreated.

Besides basic laboratory parameters, such as mean corpuscular volume, reticulocyte count, serum ferritin, and transferrin saturation, the concentration of soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) and novel parameters like the sTfR/log ferritin index can guide the challenging task of differentiating between ID and ACD. Once identified, causes of anemia should be treated accordingly. This review summarizes our understanding of anemia in IBD patients, including the underlying pathology, diagnostic approaches, and appropriate anemia treatment regimens.

### Prognostic importance of emerging cardiac, inflammatory, and renal biomarkers in chronic heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction and anaemia: RED-HF study [^117Nt3Kn]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2018). High credibility.

Our study has several limitations. We used a clinical trial cohort; therefore, although the patients are more homogeneous than in unselected cohorts, the data may not be generalizable to other chronic HF cohorts. There are some regional differences in patient characteristics, but we adjusted for region in our Cox models. The majority of our patients had relatively advanced HFrEF, although it is in this group that prognostication may be most relevant. Our patients also had anaemia, although this was mild, with a median haemoglobin of 112 g/dL, and anaemia is common in HFrEF, especially in more advanced cases. Despite this, our findings are broadly in line with and expand on recently published data from an unselected cohort of HF patients. The narrow range of haemoglobin concentrations among participants precludes meaningful study of how haemoglobin levels might modify the association between other biomarkers and outcomes. The study focuses on a single baseline measure of biomarkers at an arbitrary point in an established chronic disease (i.e. at study recruitment); HFrEF patients may often have clinical blood tests during acute episodes, which is a different setting.

In conclusion, the established biomarker NT-proBNP offered the greatest prognostic utility for adverse outcomes in these chronic HFrEF patients with moderate anaemia. Additional neurohumoral, renal, and inflammatory biomarkers did not predict adverse outcomes as strongly and did not add to a basic clinical prediction model which included NT-proBNP, although incremental information was added by hsTnT.

### Assessment of iron status in settings of inflammation: Challenges and potential approaches [^114B8zHG]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

The determination of iron status is challenging when concomitant infection and inflammation are present due to the confounding effects of the acute-phase response on the interpretation of most iron indicators. This review summarizes the effects of inflammation on indicators of iron status and evaluates the impact of a regression analysis to adjust for inflammation on estimates of iron deficiency (ID) in low- and high-infection-burden settings.

We reviewed cross-sectional data from 16 surveys for preschool children (PSC) (n = 29,765) and from 10 surveys for nonpregnant women of reproductive age (WRA) (n = 25,731) from the Biomarkers Reflecting the Inflammation and Nutritional Determinants of Anemia (BRINDA) project.

- **Effects of CRP and AGP concentrations**: Effects of C-reactive protein (CRP) and α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) concentrations on estimates of ID according to serum ferritin (SF) (used generically to include plasma ferritin), soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), and total body iron (TBI) were summarized in relation to infection burden (in the United States compared with other countries) and population group (PSC compared with WRA). Effects of the concentrations of CRP and AGP on SF, sTfR, and TBI were generally linear, especially in PSC.

Overall, regression correction changed the estimated prevalence of ID in PSC by a median of +25 percentage points (pps) when SF concentrations were used, by -15 pps when sTfR concentrations were used, and by +14 pps when TBI was used. The estimated prevalence of ID in WRA changed by a median of +8 pps when SF concentrations were used and by -10 pps when sTfR concentrations were used.

### Anemia of inflammation [^116xxuaK]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology Education Program (2010). Low credibility.

Inflammation arising from various etiologies, including infection, autoimmune disorders, chronic diseases, and aging, can promote anemia. The anemia of inflammation (AI) is most often normocytic and normochromic and is usually mild. Characteristic changes in systemic iron handling, erythrocyte production, and erythrocyte life span all contribute to AI. The preferred treatment is directed at the underlying disease. However, when the inflammatory insult is intractable or the cause has not been diagnosed, there are limited options for treatment of AI. Because anemia is a comorbid condition that is associated with poor outcomes in various chronic disease states, understanding its pathogenesis and developing new tools for its treatment should remain a priority.

Hepcidin antimicrobial peptide has taken center stage in recent years as a potent modulator of iron availability. As the technology for quantitative hepcidin analysis improves, hepcidin's role in various disease states is also being revealed. Recent insights concerning the regulatory pathways that modify hepcidin expression have identified novel targets for drug development. As the field advances with such therapeutics, the analysis of the impact of normalized hemoglobin on disease outcomes will confirm whether anemia is a reversible independent contributor to the morbidity and mortality associated with inflammatory diseases.

### Adjusting soluble transferrin receptor concentrations for inflammation: Biomarkers Reflecting Inflammation and Nutritional Determinants of Anemia (BRINDA) project [^115wE4Pd]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

There was a wide variation in the prevalence of unadjusted soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) concentration > 8.3 mg/L. The prevalence of iron-deficient erythropoiesis was higher in children than in women, with the percentage in preschool children (PSC) ranging from 4.1% to 76.7%, and in women of reproductive age (WRA) from 5.8% to 34.0%.

- **Estimated prevalence of iron-deficient erythropoiesis**:
	- The use of serum AGP to adjust sTfR concentrations for inflammation showed varying results.

- **Figure 3 observations**:
	- Estimated prevalence [% (95% CI)] of elevated sTfR concentrations was determined using different adjustment factors based on elevated AGP in preschool children from the BRINDA project. Surveys are ordered alphabetically. Notably, bars with different lowercase letters within a given country indicate significant differences, P < 0.05, adjusted using the Bonferroni correction method.

- **AGP and other correction factors**:

### Inflammation and anaemia in a broad spectrum of patients with heart failure [^113ucEtZ]. Heart (2012). Low credibility.

Anaemia in heart failure (HF) is associated with a poor prognosis. Although inflammation is assumed to be an important cause of anaemia, the association between anaemia and inflammatory markers in patients with HF has not been well established.

- **Methods**: Data from a multicentre randomised clinical trial were used, involving patients eligible if they were older than 18 years and admitted for HF (New York Heart Association II-IV). In a subset of 326 patients, haemoglobin (Hb), haematocrit, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor (sTNFR)-1, and erythropoietin (Epo) were measured at discharge. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality, with a follow-up period of 18 months.

- **Results**: Anaemia, defined as Hb < 13 g/dl for men and < 12 g/dl for women, was present in 40% (130 out of 326) of the study population. Median levels of IL-6, hsCRP, and sTNFR-1 were significantly higher in anaemic patients compared to non-anaemic patients. Logistic regression demonstrated that each increase in hsCRP values (OR 1.58 per SD log hsCRP; 95% CI 1.09 to 2.29; p = 0.016) and each increase in sTNFR-1 values (OR 1.62 per SD log sTNFR-1; 95% CI 1.24 to 2.11; p < 0.001) were independently associated with anaemia. Additionally, Epo (HR 1.31 per log Epo; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.69; p = 0.041) and sTNFR-1 (HR 1.47 per log sTNFR-1; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.86; p = 0.001) levels were independently associated with the outcome.

Anaemia is present in 40% of patients hospitalised for HF and is independently associated with inflammation.

### VAFSEO [^115WRUmV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Pre-treatment and on-treatment evaluations of anemia, iron stores, and liver tests involve several critical steps:

- **Evaluation of anemia and iron stores**: Correct and exclude other causes of anemia (e.g. vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, bleeding) before initiating VAFSEO. Evaluate iron status in all patients before and during treatment. Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg/L or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The majority of patients with CKD will require supplemental iron during the course of therapy. Measure hemoglobin (Hb) at baseline and as recommended in Section 2.4.

- **Liver testing**: Measure serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and bilirubin before initiating VAFSEO, monthly after initiation for the first 6 months, and then as clinically indicated. Discontinue VAFSEO if there are persistent ALT or AST elevations greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or if ALT or AST elevations greater than 3 times ULN are accompanied by a bilirubin increase greater than 2 times ULN.

Important dosing information includes the necessity to individualize dosing and use the lowest dose of VAFSEO sufficient to reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions. Do not target a hemoglobin level higher than 11 g/dL. VAFSEO can be taken with or without food. The medication should be swallowed whole; tablets should not be cut, crushed, or chewed.

### Diagnosis and treatment of anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^115ah5qv]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Previously, the Ganzoni formula has been widely used to estimate iron requirements and dosage, although this has been criticized as inconvenient, inconsistent, and inaccurate. More recently, a novel scheme of total iron calculation has been proposed and provides a simple and efficient dosing regimen. Although this scheme has only been evaluated for the dosing of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose, physicians have broadly adopted it for use with other intravenous iron products. Adjustments may be made in patients with very severe anemia (< 7.0 g/dL). In these patients, experts suggest an additional dosage of 500–1000 mg according to evaluated tolerability.

- **Estimated total iron need in inflammatory bowel disease patients with iron-deficiency anemia**: After successful initial treatment of ID anemia, IBD patients are still at an increased risk of anemia recurrence and may benefit from prophylactic iron substitution. Initial infusions with ferric carboxymaltose (Ferinject®) seem to adequately prevent recurrences. Recent data suggest an intravenous iron re-treatment as soon as serum ferritin drops below 100 µg/L or recurrence of anemia occurs. Notably, however, Ali et al demonstrated that up to 8 weeks after intravenous iron-dextran therapy, ferritin levels may not sufficiently reflect the availability of iron in patients' bone marrow, suggesting that clinicians should avoid assessing the response too soon after therapy.

- **Therapy of ACD in IBD**: After diagnosing ACD and addressing any coincident ID, treatment of ACD should focus on optimization of IBD treatment.

### Methodologic approach for the biomarkers reflecting inflammation and nutritional determinants of anemia (BRINDA) project [^111fL43N]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

The second major contribution of the BRINDA project is the characterization of potential factors associated with inflammation and risk factors for anemia to better understand the drivers of these widespread phenomena. Inflammation is increasingly recognized as playing an important role in disease and nutritional deficiencies, but little is known, to our knowledge, about the prevalence and demographic differences of inflammation in low- and middle-income countries. In contrast, anemia has long been recognized as a problem, with recent global estimates in children (43%) and women (33%) revealing little to no reduction in anemia between 1995 and 2011. Although poorly designed and implemented interventions have largely contributed to this lack of progress, an additional failure has been a poor understanding of anemia risk factors. Recently, a cause-specific attribution to anemia has been modeled with the use of estimation techniques that required a high degree of extrapolation. Although this is an important step forward, it underscores the need to assess risk factors directly. The body of work in the supplement highlights the importance of using real data to assess risk factors for anemia and provides a conceptual framework for dealing with such analyses.

There are several strengths of the BRINDA project, including its multipartner and collaborative nature, comparability of laboratory methods, and the large sample size from diverse countries. There are also important caveats about the data available. Data were aggregated from household-based surveys. The surveys were designed to capture relevant data points, yet limitations still exist.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, especially in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the AGA 2024 guidelines recommend establishing the cause of iron deficiency anemia (IDA). It is crucial to determine whether it is due to inadequate intake or absorption, or loss of iron, typically from gastrointestinal bleeding. Treating active inflammation is advised to enhance iron absorption or reduce iron depletion (Best Practice Advice).

### Adjusting total body iron for inflammation: Biomarkers reflecting inflammation and nutritional determinants of anemia (BRINDA) project [^111jBHu7]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Total body iron (TBI), calculated from ferritin and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), allows for the evaluation of the full range of iron status from deficiency to excess. However, both ferritin and sTfR are affected by inflammation and malaria, which may require a statistical adjustment. Although TBI has been used to assess iron status in the United States, its use worldwide and in settings with inflammation has been limited.

- **Objective**: We examine whether inflammation-adjusted ferritin and sTfR concentrations affect TBI values and the prevalence of low TBI (5 mg/L or α-1-acid glycoprotein concentration > 1 g/L).
- **Methods**:
	1. The application of arithmetic correction factors.
	2. The use of regression correction.

- **Results**: Regardless of the method used to adjust ferritin and sTfR for inflammation, the adjusted mean TBI decreased in both preschool children (PSC) and women of reproductive age (WRA) compared with unadjusted values. Subsequently, inflammation-adjusted TBI increased the prevalence of low TBI by a median of 4–14 percentage points (pps) in PSC and 1–3 pps in WRA.

### Iron deficiency across chronic inflammatory conditions: International expert opinion on definition, diagnosis, and management [^114G1cVV]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

Our review of international guidelines available for CHF, CKD, and IBD reveals no consensus practical guidance for diagnosing iron deficiency independent of anemia. However, only some guidelines recognize iron deficiency as a standalone condition. Whether this is through lack of awareness of iron deficiency or an intentional omission is difficult to establish. Iron deficiency can be simply diagnosed with routinely available blood tests measuring serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT), yet guidelines often lack agreement on test cut-off values for these parameters.

Serum ferritin levels are sensitive to inflammation, and some guidelines recommend assessment of chronic inflammation according to inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. However, there is little consensus for many conditions on when this should be measured. Should it be standard practice for all patients or measured only when serum ferritin is > 30 µg/L or if patients are symptomatic? Moreover, no standard CRP cut-off values are provided, although a CRP level of 5 mg/L is the most common threshold; this is not recognized in most guidelines.

### Diagnosis and treatment of anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^115iRmFf]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

In IBD patients, identifying iron deficiency (ID) anemia can be complex. Low serum ferritin levels (< 30 µg/L), high transferrin levels, and a decreased mean corpuscular volume (MCV) index are typically used to screen for ID. However, in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), these parameters may not always lead to reliable conclusions due to overlapping causes of anemia and multiple confounding factors. Active inflammation, for instance, can result in falsely normal or elevated ferritin levels as part of an acute-phase reaction. Furthermore, under chronic inflammatory conditions, other indicators of low iron stores are less interpretable due to alterations such as increased platelet counts or low transferrin levels. It is thus important to note that serum ferritin levels up to 100 µg/L do not adequately exclude ID.

The concentration of soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) is more reliable under these conditions, as it remains unaffected by chronic inflammation. Recently, the ratio of sTfR to the logarithm of serum ferritin (sTfR/log ferritin index) has been reported to enhance accuracy in differentiating ID anemia from anemia of chronic disease (ACD). For example, a prospective multicenter observational trial with 145 non-IBD patients with anemia highlighted the utility of the sTfR/log ferritin index. Skikne et al. demonstrated that individuals with ID anemia or ACD combined with ID anemia had significantly higher sTfR and sTfR/log ferritin index values compared to those with ACD. The study's ROC curves established cutoff values of 21 nmol/L for sTfR and 14 (using nmol/L) for the sTfR/log ferritin index, demonstrating that the sTfR/log ferritin index was superior to sTfR alone.

Functional ID in IBD patients is a complex issue needing thorough investigation to ensure accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.

### Methodologic approach for the biomarkers reflecting inflammation and nutritional determinants of anemia (BRINDA) project [^113oY3vR]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Because the data sets were derived from cross-sectional surveys, we were unable to establish a temporal relation between the exposures and outcomes. In regard to the biomarker papers, this inability meant that a differentiation between true micronutrient deficiency and the body's biological response to inflammation was not possible. In addition, we were unable to perform sensitivity analyses that compared adjustment approaches in the absence of gold-standard measurements of micronutrient biomarkers, such as iron (bone marrow aspirates) and vitamin A (liver reserves). However, as previously mentioned, the RC approach appears to better reflect the underlying linear relation between the micronutrient biomarker and inflammation.

Similar to the biomarker papers, the use of cross-sectional data was also a weakness for the inflammation and anemia papers because of the sequential nature of the relation between these outcomes and their risk factors. The BRINDA group was unable to fully capture the complex biological interplay between anemia, infections, inflammation, and micronutrient deficiencies. In addition, it was not possible to distinguish between different types of anemia in the present investigation. The measurement of the mean corpuscular volume, reticulocyte count, and haptoglobin may better elucidate the interrelations between the risk factors for anemia. There were also important risk factors for anemia and inflammation that were either not assessed or were not assessed in a sufficient number to be included in our models, such as helminth infections, genetic disorders, and folate deficiency.

### Adjusting ferritin concentrations for inflammation: Biomarkers reflecting inflammation and nutritional determinants of anemia (BRINDA) project [^112JYUiN]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

We showed a stronger relation between inflammatory and ferritin biomarkers in children than in women, which translated into a greater increase in the estimated prevalence of depleted iron stores in children when adjusted for inflammation. This result may be indicative of differences in the response of ferritin to an inflammatory event across the life cycle. Although this hypothesis needs to be further explored, there has been supporting evidence of age-specific differences when it comes to iron metabolism, malaria, and pharmacokinetics.

The principal limitations of this study are the selection of data sets based on convenience (i.e. the availability of data from BRINDA partners), the cross-sectional nature of the data, and the absence of a gold-standard measure of iron status. With the use of the BRINDA database, we were unable to determine whether CRP and AGP incompletely capture the relation between ferritin and inflammation or, alternatively, whether the adjustment approaches overadjust ferritin concentrations on the basis of a third unknown confounder. A comparison of adjustment approaches against a gold standard (e.g. bone marrow iron) and the use of longitudinal data would further contribute to the evidence.

Exploration of the potential utility of other iron biomarkers that are less affected by inflammation and infections would be worthwhile. One such biomarker, soluble transferrin receptor, was also shown to be influenced by inflammation and infections both individually and as part of the body iron equation using a similar adjustment approach.

### Use of reticulocyte hemoglobin content in the assessment of iron deficiency in children with inflammatory bowel disease [^116p455K]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency and anemia affect up to 50% to 75% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Iron deficiency in IBD may be difficult to diagnose because of the effect of inflammation on iron status biomarkers. Thus, there is a need for better methods to accurately determine iron status in IBD.

- **Objective**: The aim of the study was to investigate the association of inflammation with hemoglobin content of reticulocytes (CHr) and the utility of CHr in comparison to standard iron biomarkers.

- **Methods**: We conducted a cross-sectional study of children with IBD. Iron biomarkers (CHr, ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor [sTfR], hepcidin, hemoglobin) were measured along with systemic biomarkers of inflammation (C-reactive protein, α1-acid glycoprotein). Spearman correlations were used to evaluate the relation of inflammation and iron biomarkers. The criterion standard for iron deficiency was defined as inflammation-corrected ferritin 8.3 mg/L. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to estimate the prognostic values of all iron biomarkers to identify patients with iron deficiency.

- **Results**: We analyzed data in 62 children ages 5 to 18 years. Sixty-nine percent of our subjects had Crohn disease and 31% had ulcerative colitis, of which 42% were girls and 53% African American. The prevalence of anemia was 32%, iron deficiency was 52% using ferritin 8.3 mg/L, 39% using red blood cell distribution width of > 14.5%, 26% using body iron stores of < 0 mg/kg body weight, 25% using CHr of < 28 pg, and 11% using mean corpuscular hemoglobin.

For stable patients in the maintenance phase of EPO-stimulating agent treatment, monitoring should occur every 1–3 months. More frequent monitoring should be considered based on clinical circumstances.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for anemia of chronic kidney disease, especially in evaluating functional iron deficiency, BCSH 2013 guidelines recommend measuring serum ferritin levels. This is essential for the assessment and management of patients with all forms of iron-restricted erythropoiesis, including functional iron deficiency. It is advised to monitor values up to 1,200 mcg/L to evaluate the potential for iron overload.

### Diagnosis and management of anaemia of chronic disease: current status [^112ekgeq]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Low credibility.

Anaemia of chronic disease is the second most common form of anaemia worldwide and is observed in various inflammatory, infective, and malignant diseases. Functional iron deficiency is fundamental to the pathogenesis of the anaemia, with the polypeptide hepcidin playing a key role. Diagnosis may be challenging, but new automated red cell indices, algorithms for detecting functional iron deficiency, and assays for hepcidin levels are being developed.

Management of the underlying disease process usually improves haemoglobin levels. However, when this is not possible, erythropoietic stimulating agents are often used, although concerns about potential adverse effects, particularly thromboembolism, persist. There is increasing evidence that supplemental iron administered parenterally can safely overcome functional iron deficiency. Inhibitors of hepcidin and various inflammatory modulators show promise for the future.

### Assessment of vitamin D status and association with inflammation: Biomarkers reflecting inflammation and nutritional determinants of anemia (BRINDA) project [^11152dRN]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2023). Low credibility.

The justification to adjust estimates of the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency for inflammation requires a strong biological basis; however, our understanding remains limited about the bidirectional relationship between vitamin D and inflammation. Many have postulated that vitamin D deficiency is the consequence of inflammation, possibly owing to the rapid renal conversion between prohormone 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D which is up-regulated during infection or inflammation. Evidence supporting this hypothesis remains mixed, as several studies observed that the concentration of 25(OH)D dropped after inflammation while other studies found that the concentration of 25(OH)D was relatively stable during and after the course of infection and inflammation.

In contrast, others have argued that vitamin D deficiency can contribute to inflammation through promoting the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides, up-regulating anti-inflammatory cytokines, activating adaptive immune response, and modulating cytosol calcium concentrations. Furthermore, excess 25(OH)D concentrations could also lead to pro-inflammatory effects and increase the risk of chronic diseases. The biological mechanisms linking vitamin D and inflammatory biomarkers need to be better understood before justifying the adjustment of vitamin D biomarkers for inflammation.

At least 99% of the 25(OH)D in serum is bound to vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP) or albumin, both of which are negative acute phase reactants. Therefore, declines in serum VDBP and albumin concentrations may contribute to a decline in the total 25(OH)D.

### Assessment of iron status in settings of inflammation: challenges and potential approaches [^115WpLWF]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

The determination of iron status is challenging when concomitant infection and inflammation are present because of confounding effects of the acute-phase response on the interpretation of most iron indicators. This review summarizes the effects of inflammation on indicators of iron status and assesses the impact of a regression analysis to adjust for inflammation on estimates of iron deficiency (ID) in low- and high-infection-burden settings.

We overviewed cross-sectional data from 16 surveys for preschool children (PSC) (n = 29,765) and from 10 surveys for nonpregnant women of reproductive age (WRA) (n = 25,731) from the Biomarkers Reflecting the Inflammation and Nutritional Determinants of Anemia (BRINDA) project. Effects of C-reactive protein (CRP) and α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) concentrations on estimates of ID according to serum ferritin (SF) (used generically to include plasma ferritin), soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), and total body iron (TBI) were summarized in relation to infection burden (in the United States compared with other countries) and population group (PSC compared with WRA).

Effects of the concentrations of CRP and AGP on SF, sTfR, and TBI were generally linear, especially in PSC. Overall, regression correction changed the estimated prevalence of ID in PSC by a median of +25 percentage points (pps) when SF concentrations were used, by −15 pps when sTfR concentrations were used, and by +14 pps when TBI was used. The estimated prevalence of ID in WRA changed by a median of +8 pps when SF concentrations were used, and by −10 pps when sTfR concentrations were used.

### Association of anemia and erythropoiesis stimulating agents with inflammatory biomarkers in chronic kidney disease [^11661eo5]. Kidney International (2008). Low credibility.

Inflammatory cytokines are important predictors of cardiovascular mortality, especially in patients with chronic kidney disease. Here, we explored the relationship between anemia, epoetin treatment, and inflammatory cytokine levels in these patients.

One hundred non-dialysis patients with chronic kidney disease, all over 18 years of age, were evenly split into anemic and non-anemic cohorts. Of the 50 anemic patients, 23 were receiving erythropoiesis stimulating agent treatments. Levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were found to be significantly higher, and serum albumin was significantly lower, with trends towards higher interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 in anemic compared to non-anemic patients.

Further analysis using multiple logistic regression found that anemic patients treated with erythropoiesis stimulating agents had significantly higher odds for the upper two quartiles for IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha compared to non-anemic patients. Our study found that the anemia of chronic kidney disease was associated with upregulation of TNF-alpha, and possibly IL-6 and IL-8, along with increased levels of these proinflammatory cytokines in patients treated with epoetin.

### Serum hepcidin in inflammatory bowel diseases: Biological and clinical significance [^115tbARs]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Hepcidin, a peptide produced by hepatocytes, regulates body iron homeostasis. Inflammation increases serum hepcidin, and its determination can be useful in the differential diagnosis of anemias during inflammatory diseases.

- **Methods**: We measured serum hepcidin-25 and hepcidin-20 isoforms in 54 patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and 54 reference subjects (36 healthy controls and 18 anemic patients without inflammation or renal failure). Disease activity, blood counts, iron status, and erythropoiesis-related parameters were obtained for all study subjects.

- **Results**: In IBD, hepcidin-25, the peptide bioactive isoform, correlated positively with C-reactive protein and serum ferritin; an inverse correlation was observed with transferrin, the soluble transferrin receptor, and the soluble transferrin receptor to Log(ferritin) ratio. Similar correlations were found in reference subjects. Patients with anemia of inflammation had higher hepcidin-25 levels than those with iron deficiency anemia or a combination of iron deficiency anemia and inflammation (P = 0.0061). In patients with inflammation and serum ferritin concentration 100 to 200 ng/mL, hepcidin-25 was low, suggesting that these patients had iron deficiency. A serum hepcidin-25 concentration below 2.0 nM differentiated 85% of patients with iron deficiency anemia (with or without inflammation) from patients with anemia of inflammation. In IBD, hepcidin-20 correlated with both hepcidin-25 and C-reactive protein.

- **Conclusions**: In IBD, iron stores, inflammation, and iron requirement for erythropoiesis influence serum hepcidin levels.

### Iron deficiency screening is a key issue in chronic inflammatory diseases: A call to action [^111iDNqp]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

- **Recommendations for treatment**: Recommendations for iron supplementation vary according to the guidelines. The NCCN guidelines are designed primarily for anemic patients receiving ESA, not for those with iron deficiency (ID) alone. Intravenous or oral iron is recommended for absolute ID (serum ferritin < 30 ng/ml and TSAT < 20%); if anemia is not corrected within four weeks, consideration should be given to functional ID. In cases of functional ID (serum ferritin 30–500 µg/L and TSAT < 20%), intravenous iron is recommended for patients on ESA therapy.

	- According to ESMO guidelines, ID should be corrected as soon as serum ferritin levels are < 100 µg/L and TSAT is < 20%, regardless of anemia. Oral iron treatment can only be considered in patients with absolute ID with ferritin < 30 µg/L in the absence of an inflammatory state (C-reactive protein [CRP] < 5 mg/L).

- **Knowledge gaps**: ID remains insufficiently diagnosed in cancer patients, and guideline recommendations are insufficiently applied. Iron therapy is typically regarded only as a supportive care treatment, often combined with ESA in advanced cancer disease. There is a lack of data on ID — with or without anemia — in the early phases of cancer in patients undergoing adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment. The insufficient use of iron therapy by oncologists may be related to previous concerns and uncertainties regarding iron administration in this context. Although iron therapy is recommended for patients controlled with antitumor treatment, iron is also considered a promising target in cancer progression as it facilitates cell proliferation and growth. Additionally, blood transfusion has b

### Parenteral iron therapy in cancer-associated anemia [^1169x3Bz]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2010). Low credibility.

Anemia is common in cancer patients. Its cause is multifactorial, so a brief workup is always necessary to rule out simple, reversible causes. Anemia of chronic disease/inflammation and chemotherapy-induced anemia are the most common causes. Symptomatic or clinically severe anemia may require treatment with blood transfusion or an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA). If ESA therapy is chosen, developing evidence now suggests that, similar to chronic renal failure patients on hemodialysis, the addition of intravenous iron can improve the response to ESA because of iron-restricted erythropoiesis, even in the iron-replete patient.

### Diagnosis and treatment of anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^113bSGbB]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Anemia represents one of the most frequent complications in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and severely impairs the quality of life of affected patients. The etiology of anemia in IBD patients can be multifactorial, often involving a combination of iron deficiency (ID) and anemia of chronic disease (ACD). Although guidelines recommend screening for and treatment of anemia in IBD patients, observational data suggest that it still remains underdiagnosed and undertreated.

Besides basic laboratory parameters (e.g. mean corpuscular volume, reticulocyte count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation), the concentration of soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) and novel parameters such as the sTfR/log ferritin index can guide the challenging task of differentiating between ID and ACD. Once identified, the causes of anemia should be treated accordingly. This review summarizes our understanding of anemia in IBD patients, including the underlying pathology, diagnostic approaches, and appropriate anemia treatment regimens.

### Proinflammatory state and circulating erythropoietin in persons with and without anemia [^114MxGoS]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

High circulating levels of proinflammatory cytokines cause anemia, perhaps by interacting with erythropoietin production or biological activity. We characterize the relationships of systemic inflammation, erythropoietin, and hemoglobin.

Data are from the InCHIANTI (Invecchiare in Chianti, aging in the Chianti area) study population. A sample of 1270 persons aged 65 years or older and 30 men and 30 women from each age-decade 20 to 70 years were randomly selected from the residents in the Chianti, Italy, geographic area. Of the 1714 eligible persons, 1235 had complete data on inflammatory markers, erythropoietin, hemoglobin, potential causes of anemia, and other relevant covariates. Anemia was defined as hemoglobin less than 12 g/dL in women and less than 13 g/dL in men.

Independent of age, sex, and hemoglobin, the number of elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, interleukin-1beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) was associated with progressively higher erythropoietin in non-anemic participants but lower erythropoietin in anemic participants. Findings were consistent across different causes of anemia. The threshold at which the effect of inflammation on erythropoietin reversed was close to 13.0 g/dL of hemoglobin.

Our findings suggest that anemia of inflammation evolves from a "pre-anemic" stage characterized by a compensatory increment of erythropoietin that maintains normal hemoglobin levels to a stage of clinically evident anemia in which erythropoietin levels are not high enough to maintain normal hemoglobin levels.

### Methodologic approach for the biomarkers reflecting inflammation and nutritional determinants of anemia (BRINDA) project [^1123YYmL]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). High credibility.

The Biomarkers Reflecting Inflammation and Nutritional Determinants of Anemia (BRINDA) project is a multiagency and multicountry collaboration established to improve micronutrient assessment and better characterize anemia. The objectives of the project were as follows:

- **Identify factors associated with inflammation**: This goal involved assessing relations between inflammation, malaria infection, and biomarkers of iron and vitamin A status. The project also focused on comparing adjustment approaches.

- **Assess risk factors for anemia**: The project targeted preschool children (PSC) and women of reproductive age (WRA).

The BRINDA database inclusion criteria were specific to surveys that:

1. Were conducted after 2004.
2. Had target groups of PSC, WRA, or both.
3. Used a similar laboratory methodology for measuring at least one biomarker of iron (ferritin or soluble transferrin receptor) or vitamin A status (retinol-binding protein or retinol), and at least one biomarker of inflammation (α-1-acid glycoprotein or C-reactive protein).

Individual datasets were standardized and merged into a BRINDA database, comprising 16 nationally and regionally representative surveys from 14 countries. Collectively, the database covered all six WHO geographic regions and contained approximately 30,000 PSC and 27,000 WRA. Data were analyzed both individually and in combination using a meta-analysis. The methods used to standardize the BRINDA database and the analytic approaches employed to address the research questions are detailed in this article.

### Anemia and anemia correction: surrogate markers or causes of morbidity in chronic kidney disease [^112UTSei]. Nature Clinical Practice Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Observational studies have shown a strong positive correlation between the severity of anemia and the risk of poor outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This observation was initially interpreted to imply that adverse outcomes in CKD are caused by anemia. However, the assumption of causality overlooks the possibility that anemia and adverse outcomes might be unrelated and that both are caused by underlying inflammation, oxidative stress, and comorbid conditions. Randomized clinical trials of anemia correction have revealed an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients assigned to normal, rather than subnormal, hemoglobin targets. As a result, correction of anemia is now considered potentially hazardous in patients with CKD. Notably, individuals who did not reach the target hemoglobin level in the clinical trials, despite receiving high doses of erythropoietin and iron, experienced a disproportionately large share of the adverse outcomes. These observations suggest that the overdose of erythropoietin and iron, rather than anemia correction per se, is the likely culprit. This review explores the reasons for the apparent contradiction between the findings of observational studies and randomized clinical trials of anemia treatment in CKD. The focus is on data from basic and translational studies, which are often overlooked in the design and interpretation of clinical studies and in the formulation of clinical guidelines.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for anemia of chronic kidney disease, specifically in terms of initial evaluation, the UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend evaluating all patients with chronic anemia associated with CKD for the underlying cause and potential treatment. This is recommended in cases where hemoglobin levels are below 110 g/L (or below 105 g/L in patients aged under 2 years) or if symptoms are attributable to anemia, regardless of the grade of kidney disease or the requirement for renal replacement therapy (RRT).
